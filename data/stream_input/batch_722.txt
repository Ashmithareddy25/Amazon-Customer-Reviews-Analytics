0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is an amazing book. Everyone should read this book at least once in their lives. This is the third copy I have bought of this book.  Whenever I loan it out I never get it back, yet I keep buying it and keep loaning it out. It is just that good.
B000002504|4.0|Definitely an acquired taste, this progressive rock blast from the past is topheavy with virtuosic albeit idiosyncratic vocal and instrumental performances by one of the quintessential bands of its era.  This is a recording that requires at least three or four intent listens before you've really heard it. This is not a record for casual listening.  There are multiple layers of sound, bizarre time signatures and unconventional instrumentation and play techniques. For those whose tastes are limited to the ever-present blues rock and heavy metal of the day, this is NOT your record.  If your mind and your ears are open and your tastes are somewhat eclectic and aren't limited to vanilla, it might be right up your alley, but this is definitely a \\"Not for use by the general public\\" kind of record.

B000SM7QUC|5.0|Never before have I felt in my soul anything like this from Nikki Sixx.  This is nothing short of a Grammy winning CD. This so called \\"critic\\" that wrote the review for Amazon should find a different job if he can't see that.  I've been a Crue fan for 17 years, and this blows everything else out of the water.  The music is absolutely phenomenal, almost orchestral.  Nikki's tortured soul is perfectly emulated in the vocals of James Michael, as if Sixx were singing himself.  I also highly recommend the book, you won't want to put it down.  Don't miss this, it will touch your life!
0380713802|2.0|Bill is a good writer, but genius should be reserved for writers like Thomas Sowell, Marc Steyn, Shelby Steele, Dan Pipes, Victor Davis Hanson, etc. No, I don't expect everyone, sadly, to have read works by these brilliant men, of course.<br /><br />But anyway, a guy like Bryson, being paid to travel around Eurabia and mock people, offering his insight, should be able to produce good copy. I'd like to see more people write about the decadence, hedonism and secularism that is fueling Eurabia's rapid demise though. I know it won't be any Euros, as they cater to Islam, ignore evil, and spew hatred at the Jews just like in 1939, so hopefully more Americans will.<br />Off tangent? Nope. Poking fun at Eurabia is different than being brutally honest. Travel books about this barbaric country where six million Jews were exterminated in unappealing.<br />But yeah, while he's not a genius, you can call him acerbic, or, like the \\"great\\" John Stewart,\\" \\"witty.\\"

He really did keep it together when he was on stage.   I have no idea what it is like to be addicted to drugs but reading this book made you feel like you were right there with him willing him to get ahold on it. Thank god he did because there would be no band without him. What an awesome songwriter he is.  The honesty from Nikki and all the people included in the book was great.  You will NOT be disappointed with this book!!
0767903862|3.0|As a fellow author---though I'd never be arrogant enough to include that in my user name---I have a love/hate relationship with Bill Bryson. I love reading about travel, and overall, though he is an angry hippie, he does write about interesting places, mixing in history, which is what I want to read about when perusing travel.<br /><br />In this work, Bryson disucsses a lot about the Aussie history. That was pleasant to learn. Australia, a land of mostly good folks who understand their role in the world and, thanks to the great prime minister now fighting for re-election, recognize good and evil, unlike Eurabia and many other place. Bryson notes a lot of this and paints a stellar picture of the nation/island.<br /><br />But....as usual, Bill runs into two problems:<br /><br />1. Despite what some other reviewers say, the book is too long. I'm all for depth, but you lose your readers by penning a book of nearly 300 pages when it could be 200-250 like your others, Bill. Wordiness is okay, but some of the chapters could be half as long.<br /><br />2. I know I am one of the few travel readers/writers, who is not a self-loathing, white guilt-laden leftist, but I don't need Bill to whine about the Aborigines. Surely they deserve mention, and the first few pages of Chapter 13's historical background is fine, but I didn't need the usual Bryson social commentary whereupon he bemoans past imperialism/colonialism and tries to act as a spokesperson for people he really could care less about. Then he spends page after page whining about the lack of coverage of the Myall Creek Massacre, even going so far as to bemoan a Memorial to the Two World Wars (tens of millions died in these wars to save humanity after all), instead of Myall Creek...where 28 aborigines were sadly murdered. More folks are murdered in a month in Detroit, Bill, you apologist. Thankfully, Bill found some lunatic reporter to talk with. 28 people no civilization has ever admired dying is clearly more important to him than real battles for freedom in Eurabia. (For the record, a google search in our white guilt, PC world of 2007, turns up hundreds of articles about the Myall Creek Massacre.)<br /><br />Let's be honest though; this is what lefties, profs, etc do best. We can find enough of that in hippie books and college classrooms. in Bill's world and theirs, it's all about white guilt tripping over past racial injustice. Dark skinned individuals are presumed victims of Western imperialism. They have essentially a blank check to do anything they wish. The West is evil. We are allegedly the scum of the Earth.<br /><br />That's what will always irk me about Bryson. Aussies deserve better.dom in Eurabia.

B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie features one incredible character! He's unbelievably sexy, intelligent, quick-witted, fast on his feet, more than able to swing a sword or shoot an arrow. He's everything you would want in a movie hero!    His name is Murtagh, and sadly he's basically just a low-level sidekick.    The actual \\"hero\\" of this movie is named Eragon. He's a pathetic little creature. Arrogant, self-centered, obnoxious, annoying, oblivious and generally just awful.    \\"Eragon\\" the movie is an almost perfect translation of [[ASIN:044023848X Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)]] the book. It very excellent captures the pointless characters, the ripped-off plot, the badly-done setting and clunky dialogue. To those things is adds mediocre acting, lousy directing and even worse dialogue.    On agonybooth.com there's a write up of this movie. It points out certain things that seem obvious, but escaped the filmmaker's attention (like why is Eragon hunting in the middle of the night? Why does this \\"poor farm boy\\", live on what is, by mideval standards, a small estate? Why does he keep his bow strung and hung on a wall? Why does his cousin wear blue jeans? This, mind, is in the first ten minutes). The film also leaves one wondering why the Evil Bad Guy (tm), keeps his throne room so darkly lit. Surely there's tons of people who wanna stab him. Logically, shouldn't he keep his space bright and cheerful in order to keep from being snuck up on? (and no, I'm not sure of the grammar there, either)    Given the source materiel, I don't know if it was possible at any point for this to be made into a decent movie. None of the actors are bad. Some of them are quite good, just horrible in their roles. I know it would've been helpful had the elven character had pointy ears and had the dwarf character not been the same height as everyone else.    Basically, this is a movie that makes [[ASIN:B00003CXQM Dungeons & Dragons (New Line Platinum Series)]] look intelligent and complex. It's the kind of movie thatgives fantasy films a bad name. Had this film been made before the Lord of the Rings movies, it would have merely been stupid. Now it's just insulting to fans of fantasy and movies in general.    The final black mark against this movie? I HATED the book. Just check my review of it. I'd still rather read the book again than watch this movie. That's how bad it is.    Avoid.

Together Donald Trump and Bill Zanker delve into telling us the ins and outs of being an entrepreneur and what it takes to be successful.  I know firsthand that running a business is war, and there are challenges and stress every day.  The entrepreneur needs to thrive on those challenges and use stress to achieve.  Entrepreneurs must also love what they do with a passion that solves all day to day challenges.  I love when Bill Zanker, president and founder of the Learning Annex talks about his first event with Donald and how Donald pushed him into his \\"uncomfort-zone\\" which ultimately pushed the Learning Annex into the stratosphere.  This book was fun to read and inspiring, I give 5 full stars!
0316010669|5.0|This well-written book shows several studies that have been conducted on how we can, in a 'blink', make an accurate assessment of any situation.  The catch, however, is that one must be knowledgeable about the situation at hand.    It also shows how we can be programmed into biases by those who know how to do such things.    This book is very insightful on just how our brains are wired to work.  A very interesting subject.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Several years ago when the first season of Twin Peaks debuted on DVD it was heavily criticized for not including the Pilot episode. This was due in large part to rather complex legal reasons. Now, fans can throw away their bootlegs because this new box set collects every episode of the show, including the Pilot episode and its European cut which features a tacked on ending that Frost and Lynch were required to add in case it didn't get picked up as a series. The Lynch-approved transfer for this episode is breathtaking to behold and you can also enjoy it in a new 5.1 surround mix or the original 2.0. This holds true for the rest of the episodes.<br /><br />Of note, if you own the separate first and second seasons, hold onto them as the extra material they have are not included on this new edition. I did notice a few soundbites from some of the interviews on the second season set but not all of them.<br /><br />The ninth disc includes only four deleted scenes that are apparently the only extra footage to survive from the show (although, if you look on YouTube there is more). We get more of Audrey's autistic brother Johnny while Cooper and Truman question Dr. Jacoby. We also get footage of Lucy and Deputy Andy buying doughnuts for the rest of the police department and more insight into the dysfunctional Horne family.<br /><br />An interesting addition is the \\"Production Documents,\\" a collection of call sheets and production breakdowns that provide a look at the mechanics behind the show.<br /><br />The tenth disc features the bulk of the extras, all created with the care and craft of someone who is truly a fan of the show. \\"A Slice of Lynch\\" reunited Lynch with cast members Madchen Amick and Kyle MacLachlan over, you guessed it, pie and coffee. They are joined by Lynch's long-time assistant John Wentworth. Lynch briefly talks about the origins of the show while Amick and MacLachlan talks about how they got their respective roles.<br /><br />Lynch is clearly still frustrated that the network pressured him and Frost to solve Laura's murder and seems to still be a little sweet on Amick which is a lot of fun to see play out.<br /><br />The most substantial extra is a detailed look at the making of and legacy of the show in a feature-length documentary called, Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks that can also be viewed in four separate featurettes. It takes us through the creation of the Pilot episode with Mark Frost (who, up until now, has not appeared in previous TP DVD extras) taking us through it. Several of the actors talk about how they were cast, including Ray Wise (who originally tried out for Sheriff Truman). The making of both seasons is also covered with cast members Miguel Ferrar, Piper Laurie, Sherilyn Fenn and others talking about their experiences while crew members speak about how the sets came together and how it was really a director-driven show. Everyone talks about how the show became a pop culture phenomenon and how the country was obsessed with who killed Laura for a short time. The show's atmospheric soundtrack is also examined with Angelo Badalamenti talking about how he met Lynch and taking us through the genesis of one of the pieces of music from the show. Cast and crew speak candidly about the flaws of the second season and how it suffered once Laura's murder had been solved and Frost and Lynch went on to do other things. This is a very informative and well-made doc featuring people who have not contributed to previous DVD editions. Best of all, it is accessible to newcomers and devotees alike.<br /><br />\\"Saturday Night Live\\" features Kyle MacLachlan's monologue the night he hosted (and which he \\"reveals\\" who killed Laura) and a sketch that parodies Twin Peaks. This was done in the early 1990s with an excellent cast at the time. Phil Hartman does a great impersonation of Leland Palmer and if you look closely Conan O'Brien plays Deputy Andy.<br /><br />\\"Twin Peaks Festival\\" takes a look at the dedicated fanbase and the few fans that go to the Festival once a year. Several of them talk about what they love about the show and what the festival means to them. This featurette really captures the spirit of what it must be like to attend one of these events.<br /><br />Also included is an \\"Interactive Map\\" of eight key locations from the show, with footage of what it looks like now and a clip from the show back in the day. This extra also lists the address for said location so that you can organize your own tour.<br /><br />\\"The Black Lodge Archive\\" is a treasure trove of bits and pieces, including a music video for \\"Falling\\" by Julee Cruise who appeared on the show as the singer at the Roadhouse. There are the Georgia Coffee commercials that were shown only in Japan and were directed by Lynch and featured several cast members appearing as their characters from the show. A selection of Richard Beymer's personal collection of photographs that were taken on the set are also featured, as well as trading cards that were produced around the time of the show. You can also watch 12 \\"On-Air Promos and Spots\\" that really take you back to that time. There are even the 1-900 Hotline Promo spots (I had forgotten about those!) with all eight messages for people who wanted clues to the show at the time. Finally, there are the \\"Lucy Bumpers\\" that bookended the show before and after commercials.<br /><br />Finally, with the packaging comes a nice collection of glossy postcards featuring stills from the show.

B00006G8HX|5.0|Contrary to the \\"odd\\" opinion of odd numbered ST movies falling short. STIII in my opinion hardly does, in fact it reaches heights not seen in most of the ST movies following. ST1 doesn't do too bad either. The story focuses on Kirk and how he does all to at first search and save some aspect of his friend, Spock. We get to see aspects of Kirk's career, a new starship which may make the Enterprise's family way of life obsolete. We first see the first take of the barbarous facets on the Klignons who continue to bark and growl incessantly through the TNG and the other ST series and movies. STIII really wasn't meant to be the middle part of the trilogy. Younger fans did not live through the times when the movies came out with each movie rumored to be last. This was still when any Star Trek movie coming out was a phenomenon. Only because of Star Wars and Lucas boasting of 9 \\"episodes\\" did Paramount had to compete with 20th Fox sequel sci-fi. The scenes are portrayed poetically and while Nimoy was a first time director he was an amateur photographer even before the original series (see autobiography \\"I am not Spock\\" circa 1967) and you could tell his visions come through in some breathtaking vistas especially the return to Vulcan. Arriving at spacedock with James Horner's great variation score of ST:II is one the best ST scenes seen in any Star Trek. Spacedock was probably reconfigured from the Mother ship in \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" by the special effects company ILM. Great adventure, stunning pathos, even more bittersweet goodbyes are experienced before the ending which does not let down unlike many other sci-fi movies. Even a reference at the very end harkening back to the ending words of ST 1. STIII tooks risks , made changes, and had no reset button which was expected of the tv trailer's words \\"The LAST voyage of the Starship Enterprise\\".

B000VDDDVO|1.0|One movie on which the studio will milk the fans the world over for as many times as they can! Alright, I held back buying the 60th Anniversary edition released last year thinking there will be a definite release of this gem. When this double-disc release was announced, I was very hopeful that at least now after countless releases, this will be the definitive edition of the film but man, they proved me wrong again. Rather than working on the new release, they just repackaged the 60th Anniversary edition alongwith another disc featuring the colorised version of the film. No new extras or commentaries here, so in case, just like me, if you were looking forward to own a definitive release of this wonderful film, looks like you may have to wait a little longer. Maybe for a few more years till the publishing house milks every drop from the fans.    A billion stars for the film and no stars for this so called \\"2-disc collectors edition\\" and the studio releasing it.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|Throughout Stardust, veiwers can't help but feel like the movie is missing something...well..a few things actually. Though the title says \\"A Thrill Ride for the Whole Family\\", this movie does not seem to me to be for children.  There are some adult situations and more graphic fight scenes.  While Stardust is at times thrilling, in general, I felt it was a disappointment.  Firstly, I felt like it was missing an innocent charm that most of these whimsical fairy tail films do.  Most of the dialog was, for my taste, dry and did nothing more then provide (barely enough) information to go to the next scene.  There appeared some occasions to use humor, yet the writers let these moments sort of slip by as opposed to taking advantage of them.    On the upside, there were quite a few creative elements, outstanding costuming/ stylization, and nice cimematics. The movie becomes more engaging during the last 30 minutes, however at that point the characters have done nothing to envoke sympathy or interest and I really couldn't have cared less whether they lived or died.  I was actually rooting for Michelle Pfiffer (who to me, was the only real \\"Star\\" in Stardust) to kill the incredibly dull and self-interested Yvaine and consistently mediocre Tristan and get the movie over with.    In the end, the movie kept me mildly entertained for 2 hours and as aforementioned, had a few good points so will earn 3 stars. While I had high hopes for this movie, Stardust turned out to be flat, uninspiring and reminded me more of dust, then stardust.
0783219733|3.0|I loved Beethoven when I was young - so much so, I went around naming my Barbie dolls 'Ryce'! I thought it was the coolest name ever, and it brought a smile to my face when I watched it today, brought back some good memories.<br /><br />Beethoven is just a feel good movie. A big lovable dog, who you just want to cuddle the entire time, even if you did get drooled on. Just don't show to very young kids, cos you know what will happen! Thankfully I don't have that problem, just my mum oohing and aahing over Beethoven! The only minor quibble I have with the movie is that I can easily see Chevy Chase or Steve Martin in the role of the dad, played by Charles Grodin. Either of those two could have played that role, and dare I say it slightly better.<br /><br />But whatever happened to the gorgeous Nicholle Tom? She wasn't the best actress but she was great in the Beethoven movies (but the other two kids were definitely NOT), but she seems to have virtually disappeared from the movie world, and into made for TV movies. Which is a shame.<br /><br />Beethoven is the perfect afternoon movie of just chilling, when everyone else it out, and there's no need to feel embarrassed.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|I purchased \\"Live in Dublin\\" together with \\"Magic\\". While I gave \\"Magic\\" (deserved) five star rating, I admit that I'm spending more time listening to \\"Live in Dublin\\". I never was much into folk music, except some old Bob Dylan and Lucinda Williams's albums, so I won't talk about \\"Dublin\\" as a folk album.<br />What I can talk about is the enormous energy that this album generates, channels and radiates to the listener. I have watched the DVD first, and from the opener, totally reworked \\"Atlantic City\\" executed in perfect 16 Horsepower style, until the last song we are in for one tumultuos ride of sheer joy and love of performing. Highlights include \\"Jesse James\\", \\"Eyes On The Prize\\" (great vocals by Mark Anthony Thompson), \\"Further On Up The Road\\", absolutely marvelous \\"This Little Light Of Mine\\", \\"Open All Night\\" and outstanding rendition of \\"Blinded By The Light\\" which is the highlight of the show.<br />Due to my busy schedule, I burned the two audio CD's on my walkman, and I'm listening to them while walking to work or wherever. And there's where this music really shines. Like you are looking at the world through some magnifying glass, people are strolling by you, the same streets of your town, everything is same, and yet the music you're listening is taking you under the surface of everything, and everything looks different, because the songs are drawing you to think about all the issues we're so often not used to think about. Talking about walking over the crowded street, looking at the people's faces while Bruce sing's \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". So many moments like that from every song.<br />The pride in these songs, faith and courage of the people who wrote them, and firm faith, overwhelming sense of purpose and unmistakable joy of performing of Bruce and the Band, all that puts \\"Live in Dublin\\" among the best works of Bruce Springsteen, and certainly his best live album to date.
0099511169|4.0|The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.    Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.    Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.    A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.    Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.    Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old.

0316010669|4.0|As with his breakthrough surprise best-seller [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], Malcolm Gladwell's follow up offering is stuffed stem to stern with fascinating anecdote, and presented in the same breezy manner. And while, I suppose, there's a consistent argument buried somewhere in there, I'm blowed if I know what it is.<br /><br />Gladwell apparently can't make up his mind whether snap judgments are good things (as they seem to be for the purpose of spotting art forgeries and waging guerilla warfare) or bad things (as they seem to be when manifesting themselves in a form of temporary cop autism which causes innocent bystanders to get shot). What one is left with is a collection of anecdotes about the subconscious and immediate, each fascinating in its own right, make no mistake, and each of which undoubtedly carries its own situation-specific lesson, but which together sum up to precisely nothing at all. Sometimes Blink-style judgments are good; sometimes they proceed from our innate primordial racism. Great. Kind of.<br /><br />The story I found most interesting though, on reflection, perhaps the least genuinely on point (assuming the point is \\"how snap judgments shape the world we live in\\"), was the importance of a physician's bedside manner in assessing his (or her) likelihood of being the subject of a medical negligence suit. Gladwell would say this has everything to do with \\"thin-slicing\\" - but it is difficult to see the similarity between this sort of thin-slicing and the thin-slicing encapsuated in cop shootings or on-the-fly military strategics. But there is definitely a lesson in there for those following the professional services calling: If your clients think you're nice, you are less likely to get sued, no matter how useless you might really be - and vice versa! That's a banker.<br /><br />That observation might equally apply to this book itself: it doesn't uncover any single great insight about our mental lives, but Gladwell gets away with it because he's such an affable chap, and he writes in such an appealing way, that it seems churlish to hold this against him. We don't begrudge him what really is a fairly poorly knitted cardigan of fireside yarns - since ugly old jumpers are perfect for loafing about in on holiday, and on holiday is certainly where I read this book: as a kind of extended weekend paper feature it seemed just fine.<br /><br />Olly Buxtongets away with it because he's such an affable chap, and he writes in such an appealing way, that it seems churlish to hold this against him.

0345448898|4.0|The 'His Dark Materials' trilogy is an entertaining read, not as good as the Harry Potter series nor the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but better (in my opinion) than the chronicals on narnia.  It is a coming of age story that concentrates on two adolescent protagonists coming to terms with the changing world around them.  It is set in a multiverse which combines several fantasy realities with our own.  The writing is tedious at times, but overall the story does flow and comes together in the end.  There is no doubt to any reader that Phillip Pullman has no love for established religion, so if you are put off by opinions that don't fall in line with Christianity, I suggest not reading these books.  I do caution parents, this is a dark storyline and (again, in my opinion) is not appropriate for younger children.  Otherwise, enjoy.
0307387178|3.0|Interesting story.  Sad and frustrating, wish the outcome was happier.  I did learn some things about staying in the wild, the SOS universal sign. I have not seen the movie and wonder how close it is to the book.  Hope the family has some peace with allowing the story to be told.  It will help those who choose to challenge nature and learn from this story.
B0000042MY|5.0|No matter how you look at this movie, it is about romance.  The story line is great, the actors incredible, and the music is outstanding, and it is all about the romance of the time period and the main characters.  This is one of our favorite movies that we watch over and over.  Must see.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Jeff Tweedy isn't much of a singer. Long ago when my wife and I were dating she said Bob Dylan can't sing. I was dumbfounded for several beats and then blurted out, that is sooo irrelevant! That may also be true about Tweedy and Wilco. It seems beside the point to even notice that the singing is mediocre, because the rest is so great. Sky Blue Sky is my first Wilco and I want more.
0783240236|5.0|Wow what a classic! I am glad I finally got this movie. Great to add to your DVD collection.
B0002BK9IU|5.0|BRAIN DRAIN (1989) oughtta be considered a Ramones classic. I hate when people talk about a great rock album and say things like \\"The only good song is PET SEMETARY.\\" It's simply not true with this album. I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES is both one of the best Ramones songs ever, and also on my list of top ten rock songs of the eighties.<br /><br />Also, this album has more great songs- song for song- than any albums from the eighties. It rocks out like Road To Ruin. And is far better than any albums they recorded afterwards. It's different than the seventies albums , sure,.. but the band synched perfectly, and created a stellar rock album. ZERO ZERO...rocks, DONT BUST MY CHOPS... awesome, dig the hook, bay-bee; PUNISHMENT FITS and ALL SCREWED UP to me sound just as good as any seventies stuff, only with a little eighties production. But we're talking Red Hot Chilli Peppers eighties, not Journey. Whatever, it still sounds fresh and it sounds like Ramones. The song from that Stephen King movie is probably the most un-Ramones-like song in the mix, but it's still good. Followed by PALISADES PARK... another cool take on some fifties bubble gum that rocks.  The rest of the album balances left to right with Dee Dee's aggresive LEARN TO LISTEN and IGNORANCE IS BLISS, sandwiched between Joey Ramone ballads CANT GET YOU OUTTA MY MIND and COME BACK BABY... two songs that foreshadow some of the great tunes that Joey Ramone would do on his own. The Christmas one is good too. All three would be on any Joey Ramone greatest hits package. Should one ever be released. Every song is great. This may be my FAVORITE Ramones album of all. So stop bustin' chops.<br /><br />*The remaster series doesn't add much, except an alternate version of Pets, but I've often found it much cheaper at other places. You can save money here at Amazon, by just getting the straight version.
B000M3452Y|5.0|This second lp from LCD Soundsystem whacks the sophomore slump right out of the park! Taking the first LP to school, tracks like \\"Someone Great: and \\"Sound of Sliver\\" sound like no one else, taking their influences and making something really fresh (In a Kool and the Gang sort of way, wink, wink). Compared to their 1st LP, this feels like a comeback album. Among my best of the Year.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This album pretty much set the bar in 1985 for the future of what kind of music Tom Waits would be recording. Absolutely strange, almost nightmarish type of stuff, that occasionally turns back into the jazzy soft, heart-of-a-hooker type stuff he did in the seventies. People who first heard this album back in the day must have thought Tom Waits had completely lost his mind. Turns out, he really just found it.<br />Suddenly the tender old themes of the blood red moon, and sullen love songs via Blue Valentines, were transformed into beat heavy,psychotic, scenes from a Halloween cartoon.<br /><br />I of course, can't get enough.<br /><br />I got into Waits via Mule Variations, when it was released in '99. Which I thought was wonderful in its insanity. Theres lots of great stuff that he's done in that vein, but RAIN DOGS is the best example. There is definately some stuff on this record that you will never hear anything else come close to. It's warped, its psychedelic, it's freaky, it's sad, and yet is always pleasing to the ears... (some of his later stuff can be hard to listen to at first sometimes, you just fall into this one).<br />I was blown away by how good this album was when I first heard it. If you are unfamiliar with Tom Waits' music, this would be an excellent place to start. With or without acid.
B000VPUIA6|1.0|I was ready to hit the button, but I had to check the price twice.  Whoa! I called a friend in the UK.  The dollar is soooo low... 2x for a pound.  Guess what?  Until our economy perks up or something changes... GET USED TO IT.  The dollar also takes a licking against the euro.  What does this mean?  Not just European businesses, but American businesses need to raise prices to make a profit with the dollar worth zip.  Oy!  Bye, bye, Help dvd.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|If you've seen the first season of this killer series, the 2nd season gets even better. The story lines are more complex than the first season and the actors have really outdone themselves here.     Throughout the entire 2nd season, you can sense a buildup to a heart pounding season finale that leaves one hanging on the edge of their seat - anxious for the 3rd season. What a ride !! There is great horror, comic relief, drama, lots of attitude and no shortage of thrills in this 2nd season.     I hope you take the opportunity to view these shows, and if so - you'll be hooked. This is a great addition to any home video collection and one that'll be enjoyable for years to come - great job on this series - even if it is WB - they got it right with this one.
0525950079|1.0|Ken Follett has always been one of my favorite authors, and Pillars Of The Earth one of my favorite books.  When I saw he had a sequel I had to have it.    But who wrote the book??  There were several instances of lines of description being repeated exactly as they had been used chapters earlier.  It was like the author just fitted in lines like a jigsaw puzzle as needed.  Also, too much filler was repeating the plot, like the readers aren't going to remember what they just read.    I finished the book because it was a good story, but way too many words just to make a big book  Either the editor needs to be changed, or all the ghost writers who got to contribute.    I will but Mr. Follett's books in the future, but maybe wait for paperback
B00005JPWF|3.0|I read this book over 10 years ago and thought it was great.  I first heard that Sean Penn was making the movie in August and couldn't wait to see it.  Emil Hirsch was on the cover of Outside magazine and it had a big story about the movie.  Penn was on the cover of Esquire which featured the movie.  I saw Penn on several talk shows shortly before the movie was released.  I saw and read good reviews of the movie before it was released. All this built up a great deal of interest in this movie. Then it was finally released over a month ago and .... I'm still waiting.  After all the publicity and good reviews, the studio has not released this movie except in a very few theaters in \\"Select Cities\\" (not mine). I had encouraged a lot of my friends to go see the movie but now they have lost interest.  I think this is very poor marketing by the studio.  Why waste all the good PR and not give this movie a chance.  I guess I will have to catch it on DVD.
0312983867|2.0|Yeah, what Marc Ruby(tm) \\"The Noh Hare(tm)\\" said.  Exactly how I feel about the writing of this book.
0810993139|5.0|This is the first time my 9 year-old boy looks forward to reading.  He has read this book 3 times.  He loves it; but best of all he actually enjoyed reading.  I will definitely buy the next book coming out on fall.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|For me this is one of the great \\"mentoring\\" movies of all time.  The follow on movies don't have the wonderful impact of the original Karate Kid.  Miagi-san is the very best.  When Daniel goes to the broken down area of town and enters into Miagi's world you know it's the beginning of transformation.  The lessons hidden in the \\"wax on, wax off\\" and painting scenes are brilliant.  Classic scenes for all time cinema.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Art has its place, as does base movie thrills. This is definitely in the latter camp. Other than Planet Terror, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that jept me breathless basically from beginning to end while exclaiming \\"this is awesome!\\" Every sequence plays out like a legendary scene from a cult action b-movie, and it's more memorable than whatever Jaimee Foxx is doing these days.    The action sequences are clever and well-executed and just plain fun (who'd'a thunk of doing a shootout while skydiving?). Really, who else is looking for much more when watching a movie called \\"Shoot 'Em Up?\\"

B000002JSP|1.0|This album is what you might call Zeppelin's swan song...unfortunately, though, swans would probably not want to sing five of the seven tracks. By the time this was recorded, fame and drugs had not only caught up with but overtaken the boys, leaving any sharpness or artistry well south of the equator. There are some good moments, but really the guys are only batting about .150. Here's what I mean:<br /><br />In the Evening: In my opinion, the best track, it has in a very diluted way the characteristics of Zep's best stuff, namely a cool guitar riff that carries the whole piece, plus a timeless, otherworldly atmosphere. It's kind of moody and far-off, good for listening at night.<br /><br />South Bound Suarez: A so-so song, driven by hyperactive keyboards and caffeinated vocals that have poor Jimmy Page struggling to keep up. The mix is weird, though, making Page's guitar sound tinny and Plant like he's singing from the bottom of a trash can five miles down the road.<br /><br />Fool in the Rain: Okay, it's a cute punchline, but it would've been just as funny in  three minutes as six. The car-alarm-like repetitiveness makes it impossible for me to listen for more than about 1.5 minutes.<br /><br />Hot Dog: Yeah, it's a great song! Unfortunately, it's being done by the wrong artists! Give that baby to Ricky Skaggs and you'd have a sweltering good time on your hands, but Zep just doesn't pull it off. Robbie, I don't care if you did go on to record an album with Alison Krauss, you don't have the voice, the accent, or the cultural chops to tackle this kind of music. Remember your earlier albums, where you thought you were black? Well, you're not Appalachian either.<br /><br />Carouselambra: Just a big ol' mess. Sloppy, disorganized, and longer than many people's lives, it's so bloated I can't listen without feeling the need to purge.<br /><br />All My Love: This is actually the song I bought the album for. Love the poetic lyrics, the intricate background. But it's so over-synthed! C'mon guys, you have the money to buy an airplane and you can't get ELO--or even some studio musicians--to provide the strings? I still like the song, but I also like the fact that software has enabled me to edit the synth solo out.<br /><br />I'm Gonna Crawl: Ugh, a ballad. Features some ponderous drumming and not much else. Plus Bob's back to thinking he's black, while still singing like he's white.<br /><br />So you can see the problem. The zeppelin was finally sinking under its own weight. Too bad, because maybe this could've been the forgivable/forgettable springboard to some truly cohesive and interesting stuff. Unfortunately it's their last legacy. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll listen to it out of loyalty. Otherwise, you probably won't be too impressed.

0440238609|2.0|Is it possible to just read the book for the sake of the book or is for sure going to color your point of view? if you have no view before, will you have one after (as children may or may not)? is it (criminal, unjust, wrong, etc...) to put money in the pocket of a man who may not believe as we would like him to?    from pullman's own website, may or may not help. the rest of the info on his site is mostly concerned with his writing style, inspiration, etc, and speaks neither to good or evil.          His Dark Materials seems to be against organised religion. Do you believe in God?    I don't know whether there's a God or not. Nobody does, no matter what they say. I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away.   Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them.      Your books deal with many of life's big questions? God, the church, good and evil, love? and you are not afraid to challenge your young readers. Is that a conscious aim when you sit down in front of a blank sheet of paper? Do you think children's writing has a duty to pose difficult questions?    No. The only duty it has is best expressed in the words of Dr Johnson: \\"The only aim of writing is to help the reader better to enjoy life, or better to endure it.\\"      You have run into criticism from certain religious groups who regard you as subversive, with the Catholic Herald describing your work as 'worthy of the bonfire.' Do such emotional responses concern or upset you or does it please you to generate strong reactions?    I'm delighted to have brought such excitement into what must be very dull lives.
1400082773|3.0|Read this in March for my bookclub group.  Wanted to wait to write a review until I saw more of him in 'real life' situations.  This book does not delve into anything very personal.  I was wondering when I finished the book: who were his close friends in Chicago?  Did he ever date anyone during those years?  It's a very self serving book and he makes himself look like a good, nobel young man.  Nothing wrong with this, but I wanted to hear some stories about real events in his life from his college days and 'finding yourself' days, etc.  We all have stories and they reveal so much about why we are the way we are.  There were no such revelations in this book.  It is certainly a book everyone should read.  This is a man who wants to be the President of the United States.
B000UO338W|4.0|Ok, I was introduced to ministry sometime probably about 10 years ago now.  I'm a big fan so to think they would go out while they can still put an album of this caliber would really suck.    While this is not my favorite album (check out the land of rape and honey and the mind is a terrible thing to taste to see the extremes this band has gone through) it is still solid and classic Ministry from start to finish.    A couple of tracks are questionable but that's not that uncommon for them.  Just listen a few times and you'll be hooked.    Hope to catch them on tour next year (especially if it's there last, still have never seen them).    Get the album or buy the mp3s (whatever you prefer), you won't be disappointed.
B000063UR1|3.0|Even though I consider myself a huge science-fiction fan, I put off watching this one for a long time.  This was mainly because of negative reviews I'd read, often citing the film's slow pacing.  And while that prediction was accurate, the reviews I read missed out on a few other points, both positive and negative.<br /><br />Silent Running was directed by Douglas Trumball, the man responsible for the special effects in Kubrick's \\"2001\\". . .not coincidentally another visually-impressive but deliberately-paced film.  I realize sci-fi fans are a finickly lot, so it may help you to know that I don't think 2001 is nearly as great as its reputation suggests.  Beyond the visual splendor, it's a ploddingly dull film.  Yes, it has some impressive ideas.  But so does a good book.<br /><br />But back to Silent Running.  Bruce Dern is the lone wolf eco-scientist trying to protect the last remaining forests of Earth, which are contained in ships orbiting the planet.  His three human companions just want to get back home, and are delighted when they receive orders to nuke the floating foliage.  But Dern's character--with the unlikely name of \\"Freeman Lowell\\"--strikes out on his own, and is indirectly responsible for an accident that costs his companions their lives.<br /><br />For the rest of the film, Lowell and a trio of robots try to find a new home for their precious cargo.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the film's final, poignant scene is probably its best moment.<br /><br />Now, about this pacing issue.  It's true: Silent Running is more like Silent CRAWLING.  But this is real science-fiction, not like today's action films with sci-fi elements thrown in.  This is a film that rewards patience; and its ecologial message, though obvious from the start, is never over-bearing.<br /><br />Others have commented favorably about Bruce Dern's performance, but I have to say I disagree.  I was never quite sure how to take the character of Lowell.  He's passionate about saving the trees, yes, but it all seemed a little over-the-top.  With his wiry hair and bug eyes, he reminded me of an unfunny version of Murdock from \\"The A-Team.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, the only other real problem I had was the grating hippy-dippy tunes warbled by \\"singer\\" Joan Baez.  I know I'm going to aggravate a lot of folk-singer fans, but she's just awful.  And awfully inappropriate.  In fact, outside of the bizarre and incongruent folk songs in Wes Craven's [[ASIN:B000068IEU The Last House on the Left]], this is easily the worst soundtrack to any seventies movie.<br /><br />If you're willing to overlook these flaws, Silent Running is pretty decent film.  The story is original and intelligent, and the effects are first-rate.  In short, if you liked 2001, you'll probably like this one.eemed a little over-the-top.

B00006YXOX|5.0|During a few weeks in June, 1974, I had the good fortune to see Jochum  conduct at the Tanglewood Festival, where he performed the Bruckner 4th Symphony with the Boston Symphony.  It was an intense experience to see this musical giant turn the Boston SO into a real Bruckner orchestra that summer evening. I had the chance to speak with him on a few occasions about his approach to Bruckner...in his kind grandfatherly voice he said that Bruckner \\"must all come together....an organic whole\\". Like Furtwangler, who Jochum apprenticed under in Berlin in the early 1930's,  Jochum's  approach is never static....he fluctuates tempi and phrasing in a way that builds up and  releases tension while at the same time never forgetting the overall structure of the work.  His DG traversal of the Bruckner symphonies in stereo was  a groundbreaking project when it appeared as a set in the 1960's.  It's spirituality (remember that Jochum was also a church organist like Bruckner) is unmatched in the stereo era. He was a conductor in the Bruno Walter mode....with a very collegial approach to conducting which made orchestral musicians give their all in performing his vision of these great symphonic masterworks.  If you want THE reference set of the Bruckner symphonies for the last 50 years, this is the one to get. His Dresden EMI  remake a decade later would be a second choice in this repertoire.

B0002KVULG|5.0|In my English Literature class we are discussing vampires and Dracula, and with that we're watching all movies associated with the two.  So far, we've watched both Nosferatu's, Bela's Dracula, Chris Lee's Dracula and now, Langella'a Dracula.  So far, it's my favorite!  The movie itself is based on Bram Stoker's Book and the play.  This Dracula is somewhat out of sequence, but I think it flows better this way.  I like the character switch between Lucy and Mina and the setting flows better with this version (as opposed to Bela's Dracula)  Before this class I couldn't tell you who Frank Langella was.  I now know that I've seen him before, just never knew he played Dracula.  Damn that goofy George Harrison...The score is beautiful, I loved the wolf scenes and even the psychedelic love scene worked for me.  Langella/Dracula is sexy and sweet and sad all at the same time.  If you've read Bram Stokers novel, all these movies are worth watching once, but if your a hopeless romantic this one is worth buying.

0307276902|4.0|Understanding that much of this story was fabricated, it is still an amazing story. People bash on the book for the single reason that it was said to be a true story then found to have been embellished quite a bit. To enjoy the book you need to just take that aside and read it as you would any other book. The style of writing is fresh, though can be repetitive. The charecters are very interesting and you develop a feeling for them throughout. This is a good book but needs to be read with understanding that it is embellished.

0316067598|2.0|I am sure that the author is quite the navy SEAL but far from a writer with talent. This book provides a good story of heroism and courage with devestation and loss, but does so with such repetitve topics it becomes mind numbing. If you took out the parts of the book where he talks about the taliban being expert mountain men and how they want to destroy his team the book would probably be 200 pages shorter. He also is far to right wing in the book which is understandable with a texan but if he were to mellow out a little it would make the book much more plausible. Great story but terrible writing.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|What can I say. Great in every aspect. Gilmour is certainly one one of the all time great guitar players. All parts of the band are so tight. Great to see special guests help in the concert.

The photos were beautiful, of course, and the stories were interesting.    There was more text than I expected but I guess it was needed to truly bring out each family's story and show the human condition.    Besides the train, I also recommend reading it in front of a nice, cozy fire.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Who needs the big production of Pink Floyd. David Gilmour covers it with acoustic guitars, simple amplification, and great backup musicians.
B000G759LW|5.0|It surprised me that this only gets 4/5... that is pretty low for an online ranking.     This is an ambitious double album largely written and produced by Christina. In scope and size, it reminds me of the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" or even the Beastie Boys' \\"Ill Communication.\\" But it's probably easier to listen to than either.      A few parts of the album are silly, but more parts are amazing. The 23 tracks break down into 4 or 5 up-tempo numbers for the radio, some ballads, a few tracks with a big-band type feel, and many that don't fit into a category. That all sounds very disjointed but the end result is not.    All of this is infused with tremendous energy and effort by Christina and her big supporting cast. The end result is a pleasant surprise. This  validates anyone who (like me) saw glimmers of this in her earlier music.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant movie.  To watch what they accomplished with manual filming techniques and silent dialogue really accents how vapid and empty today's hollywood formula films are.  The lead actress does an amazing job - if you've never seen a silent film, take the time to see this - it's an experience.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|\\"Octavarium\\" is one of the greatest progressive rock songs ever written.  The continuum/lap steel guitar solo by Jordan Rudess at the beginning alone is some of the most incredibly moving pieces of music I've heard in quite a long time.  Obviously some folks may think that, at 24 minutes, the song is too long.  But my feeling is this:  grab a pair of excellent headphones, give yourself half an hour and just soak the entire piece in.  The rest of the CD is very good, especially Root of All Evil, Panic Attack, Never Enough and the excellent Sacrificed Sons.  But if you love music and especially miss the days of \\"Suppers Ready\\", \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"2112\\" than Octavarium is for you.
B000ESST6U|5.0|This production of Giulio Cesare, staged for Glyndebourne, is hard to fault. McVicar did a fantastic job of generating action, movement, political commentary and humour without distracting from the singing. The sets and costumes are equally up to the task. Moreover, everything that happens on stage makes sense - it is never there 'just for pretty' or because the director got nervous about \\"too many notes\\"...<br /><br />The singers are excellent, with Sarah Connolly the standout. To my mind she is a great Giulio Cesare: not only was her singing perfect in sound nad style, but she was so persuasive as an older man of authority that at no point was it necessary to suspend disbelief!  If I had to choose one moement from this DVD - the one that has stayed with me the most - it would be the magnificent performance of 'Va tacito e nascosto'.<br /><br />I found the very beautiful Danielle de Niese much more convincing in Cleopatra's extroverted arias than in the more introspective ones: there was no sign of pianissimo or piano! \\"Piangero\\" was just too loud (and the audience evidently agreed with me, judging from the tepid applause that greets this famous aria). But I was impressed that De Niese could manage so much dancing while singing her last aria!<br /><br />\\"Cara speme\\" was the high point of Kirschlager's role - you feel that time stops while she sings this aria.  Achille (Maltman) and Cornelia (Bardon) were also excellent - Bardon got more impressive as the opera went on. Countertenor Dumaux in the role of Tolomeo almost stole the show, and certainly stole all his scenes.<br /><br />William Christie - well, he and the orchestra are just magnificent. The young woman violinist who appeared on the stage (as a young man) for a solo during an Act II scene represented the admirable musicianship, good humour and sense of theater of this orchestra in the best possible way.<br /><br />All in all, an unmissable DVD for any Baroque lover - or any opera lover, period.

B00007AJF9|5.0|ELIZABETH is and was my introduction to director Shekhar Kapur.  Boy, can this guy make a movie. Film is a medium that works via visuals, and Kapur delivers sensational vistas, landscapes, settings, and angles.  There's a look and a feel of quality aesthetics in this film, which makes watching it a visually-enhancing experience.<br /><br />As Kapur in the special features readily admits, this is a speculative account of the early reign of Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett).  Her ascension certainly came at a most turbulent time; she succeeded her very Catholic sister, \\"Bloody Mary,\\" whose persecution of Protestant \\"heretics\\" was tearing Britain apart.  (In fact, the film opens with a disturbing scene depicting three \\"heretics\\" being burned alive at the stake; quite the \\"hook\\" to get the viewer to pay attention.)  The young queen is in dangerous waters, and turns to two men for help.  One of them, Sir William Cecil (played solidly by Sir Richard Attenborough), has consistent advice:  Get married, produce an heir.  The other advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush is sensational in this brooding, almost sinister role) is a bit more practical:  Do whatever it takes to keep Elizabeth in power.<br /><br />To top it all off, there is the matter of Elizabeth's lover (although not proven historical fact), Robert Dudley.  Played by an almost-dainty Joseph Fiennes, it becomes readily apparent young Robert will not be strong enough to handle a queen growing steadily more powerful and independent.  Dudley's outcome is one of the more predictable plot lines of the film.<br /><br />And as we watch, we see the young Elizabeth become hardened, more cynical; we see her forfeit her own personal life in exchange for a persona--an icon around whom her people can rally.  All of this is done through the exquisite professionalism of Cate Blanchett, who much deserved her Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />Other surprises in this film include a stunning Fanny Ardant, who plays Elizabeth's rival, Mary of Guise; and then there's the new James Bond, Daniel Craig, who plays a somewhat overzealous priest.  The special features pale in comparison to the movie, but come on, the movie is where the rubber meets the road.  ELIZABETH is a gripping, compelling, artistic period piece--a cinematic feast as rich as it is engrossing.  Sign me up as a Shekhar Kapur fan.<br />--D.

B000QUCNP4|3.0|While the subject matter of this movie is interesting in and of itself, the film just drags on far too long.  It grabs your attention with some grizzly murders, then spends nearly two hours developing characters with little impact on the case.  Do I really care that the cartoonist at the local paper has kids?  Do we need a half hour scene where Downey Jr. is drunk and stoned at a random beach house?  They actually waste 40 minutes focusing on a blind date the cartoonist goes on with his eventual wife.  Why?      You may enjoy this movie overall, but there will definitely come a time when you look at your watch and say out loud \\"how long is this again?\\"    I think the experience was slightly ruined for me because I had recently watched the A&E Cold Case Files program which was devoted to the Zodiac.  On that show they trim down the subject matter to about 40 minutes and you still leave with more knowledge of what actually happened.  I suggest you watch this with the remote in hand so you can fast forward often.

B000002LCI|5.0|MTV had been already established as mainstream, the BOSS was getting soft in the Tunnel of Love, BON JOVI were more about the hair than ever - and the British invented Alternative music. Two such post-punk groups, THE CURE and DEPECHE MODE, better than most others, were able to grasp the decade's vibrations and broadcast them back as UNBELIEVABLE MUSIC. Whereas the CURE were mostly edges, the DEPECHE MODE were mostly technopoetry.<br /><br />This was the first album I ever bought as a CD - and I remember bringing it home to my new JVC HiFi, anxious to listen to the \\"crisp, digital sound\\" (little did I know that, only some years later, we would come to miss the fullness and richness of the old vinyl records). I was right to be anxious though: this was ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS - EVER!<br /><br />MUSIC FOR THE MASSES is one of those rare albums that can be listened to from start to finish. No filler material here. The voices are atavisticly haunting; the keys persistently penetrating; and the lyrics stay with you for ever.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
1594489505|5.0|I'm not good with words.    But I love to read.   This book gets you from the first page.    Miriam Jo is an innocent young girl, in pre-Soviet Afghanistan.   The reader gets a real sense of the cultural richness, the beauty of this country's natural geography, its customs, family life, and more ... and then the post-Soviet years, how the country and its people suffer under warlords, the Taliban, its mistreatment of women ... I highly recommend this book.

B0006HXXBA|5.0|Yeah, some people are mixed on this album. For me, I have been listening to the Gothenburg Melodic Death movement for ten years so the alleged influences from that genre I don't mind as much as others. Some elitists at Metal-Archives like to bash this album because of that alleged influence. Do I hear it? Sort of. I think that Coma of Souls had some melodic parts thrown in (they have put in more and more melodic parts as time has gone on over the years). So I think its a continuation of that if anything. The thrashier parts are just as aggressive as the albums of yesteryear, if not more ferocious at times, and the melodic parts make things more interesting and they aren't often enough to get annoying.<br /><br />So the hype is well warranted. This is definitely one of the best thrash albums of the new millenium. The title track, totally Klassic Kreator, like Betrayer, Coma of Souls, any first track from the eighties. Suicide Terrorist, and Impossible Brutality chug along at a ferocious pace. The whole album is devoid of filler (pretty much). The only bummer I would say, is some of the production is a little stunted. I think Andy Sneap has a very homogenized style with regards to producing. A lot like Roy Z and others, his albums tend to sound samey and stale. He gets the job done, but Flemming Rasmussen or Neil Kernon he is not.<br /><br />This is especially eminent in the drum recording, which sounds too processed. Its not as bad as on the new Megadeth (eww) but its apparent that he needs to lay off the effects when recording drums. Ventor gives an excellent performance though. So the verdict is in- this album is a great release and is closer to the classic Eighties thrash than many people give it credit for.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I enjoyed the production of this dvd.  The special features as far as \\"Man's World\\" were the best part.  I never new Clint Howard was the baby elephant.  He is everywhere!!!  The special features are little difficult for a young kid, especially the first one with Kah.

B000W1V44I|5.0|Hey all. Like many people have said before, a lot of people will dismiss this album because the Backstreet Boys are linked to it. Many people act too mature to listen to them anymore, but really, the reason for this act of \\"maturity\\" is caused by their name. When you hear \\"Backstreet Boys\\", you immediately think 90s and oldies. However, people forget that they have grown and matured just as we all have and the same goes for their music. I really feel that each album directly reflects the growth of the Backstreet Boys as a group and as individuals. My favorite thing about BSB is that they do not fully conform to the trend of the times. Although their songs are very different from previous albums, they still retain their reputation as a romantic, swooning boy band. In my opinion, this album beats Never Gone because they have re-found their nitch in the music business after they lost it after the 4 year hiatus they took from 2001-2005. Never Gone reflects the searching process and Unbreakable is what they have found.     Honestly, buy the album and listen to it optimistically. Don't let the \\"Oh, they're just Backstreet Boys who I thought died a long time ago\\" mentality put prejudice on this marvelous album.    Come on BSB, regain the #1 spot :D

0765348276|3.0|Reviews which compare Old Man's War with Robert Heinlein's classic science fiction--not the kinkier, later stuff--are on the mark. Like Heinlein's [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]], this book takes us on a coming of age journey as the protagonist joins the military and leaves the familiar atmosphere of Earth. In this case the age-coming is in reverse, as a senior citizen is restored to youthful combat-readiness. The \\"BrainPal\\" computer implant and physiological enhancements are recognizable Heinlein influences, but different enough to be engaging. The reader will enjoy discovering other similarities without becoming distracted by them.<br /><br />Some Heinlein weaknesses are there, too. I say this with affection, because they are sentimental reminders of Heinlein's voice. The gadgetry and action are stronger than the characters, who sometimes seem shallow in emotionally complex situations. In the first chapter, there is a well-written melancholy to the protagonist's description of his late wife. This depth does not transfer well to his later reactions to her memory. And this isn't credibly due to a change in the character. It's worth exploring for yourself, though. If you have lost a spouse, I suggest comparing Scalzi's grasp of your experience with Stephen King's in [[ASIN:067102423X Bag of Bones]] or [[ASIN:1416585710 Lisey's Story]].<br /><br />Never mind the impefections.  :) It's a good story you can enjoy while remembering Heinlein. Buy it, read it, and keep it around to read again right after Thanksgiving dinner.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Thank goodness for music!  This is especially true in Britney Spears' case.  Even though she is enduring the nightmare of the paparazzi and the media, she still conjures up a thoroughly dance-able and ENJOYABLE album.  This is only the second Britney album that I have been able to listen to all the way through and like all of the songs on it.  The other album being \\"Oops, I Did It Again\\" in 2000.  The best songs on this disc:  \\"Break The Ice\\", \\"Gimme More\\", and \\"Radar\\".  Nothing will beat the anthem \\"Toxic\\" from the IN THE ZONE cd, but this album comes very close to topping it.  I am glad that something is going right for Ms. Spears.  Go out and buy this album.  Don't listen to the media.  Listen to the good reviews and your own mind.  You won't be disappointed.

Hot on the heels of bad publicity, court drama and that horrid MTV 'comeback, Britney makes good with possibly the best pop dance album of the year. Just when critics were ready to write her off, britney asserts her position in the music industry with a collection of songs so hot, you'll need a shower after their done. The beats are slick, vocals sexy, and the production flawless.     Everything about this album is absolute perfection, void of any filler. This is the must-have album of 2007, destined to have you shaking it well into the new year!

B000UJ24SC|5.0|An explosion of blast beats, shredding guitars, hellish shrieks and guttural bellows attack you in a catastrophic ambush. The vocalist(Trevor Strnad)really plays off the riffs of the guitar and the rhythm of the drums, complimenting eachother at just the right moment.So what's new from the Black Dahlia Murder you ask? Top Notch production which creates an ambiance of precise destruction(Listen to the sound quality of \\"Unhallowed\\" then listen to this one, it really is \\"Before and After\\"). Set your adjustments(bass,treble etc.) correctly on your stereo/computer/car, and you will be blown away by the whole album. Enjoi.<br />Standout Tracks: \\"What a Horrible Night To Have a Curse\\"-\\"I Worship Only What You Bleed\\"-\\"Nocturnal\\"-\\"Warborn\\"...but like I said, the whole album's insane.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This is, in my opinion the best movie of the year.<br /><br />The story may be unpleasant to some, but I thought it was an amazing story/fable set in a beautiful place(France) I believe around the turn of the century.<br /><br />It is the story of a boy born in a gutter (literally) and left to die.This boy was born with a gift though, the gift of smell.<br /><br />Immediately following his birth,<br />his Mother goes to the gallows to hang, and he goes to a horrible orphanage in his first years. Later on he is sold as a slave, and leads a horrible existance- Until he meets a perfumer who teaches him the art and skills in making perfumes.<br /><br />The most important thing in life to him is that he learn how to preserve smell.The smell he is so fascinated in preserving, is the scent of women.<br />Once he learns that you cannot distell a living thing, he travels to Grasse, the leading perfume maker to learn another art in preserving scent.<br />Along the way he begins murdering women, which leads to his capture, and an AMAZING ending.(This film is also VERY educational as it shows how perfumes are distelled and become oil, and also, all the chords of a perfume ie: heart chord, head chord and the base etc. the basic ingredients etc.)<br /><br />Even though there are unpleasant parts in this movie, it has the charm of a fable,The same BEAUTIFUL cinematography as \\"The Illusionist\\" did, and the characters were SO well cast.<br />The main character especially.<br />His very soul shows in his eyes.honestly. He was a WONDERFUL actor.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie got so little attention.  at least RENT it, and check it out. I guarantee you will buy it to add to your collection.<br />It is THAT good.
0375703764|5.0|Okay, first off ... I have to admit ... I have not finished reading this novel yet. But I have to say, as a visual artist this has got to be the most interesting book I've come across.<br /><br />It is a very thick book. Not exactly light reading by any means. But the book is presented in many forms, coming from many personas and suggested publication sources. Very docudrama-oriented, which completely reflects the nature of the focal character of the work. A fiction labyrinth that not only emotionally rips at you as you journey along into the destructive innards of the 'house' { always appearing in blue throughout the book, typically with some strange baseline shift to certain character }, but it also visually falls apart and creates semantic realities that only make sense in the multi-thread mayhem created by Danielewski.<br /><br />Certain pages have boxes of lists that literally dissolve through from page to page to page. Upside-down text ... fictitious footnotes that sometimes continue on for many pages at time. Various font usage to indicate different streams per character.<br /><br />The 'house' is a monster that breathes and destroys. Representing something dark and horrid about our times.<br /><br />The type falls apart mid-novel ... until only one word per page teases you along.<br /><br />Danielewski paints such a believable portrait of a filmmaker's madness and obsession with the 'house' through footnotes, references, lists, magazine and journal articles ... it reminds me of the hyperreality that Nicholson Baker presents in novels like Vox or The Fermata, only steeped with an intellectually dank serious filter strewn with dust and blood, creaking wooden floors, nightmarish in every aspect. Sinister.<br /><br />You have to read this book.<br /><br />I bought it 5 years ago ... let it sit on a shelf for far too long. Once I picked it up, I was hooked, hypnotized, entranced, bewildered. Just amazing writing that draws you in. I highly recommend it, even if you never finish it { not sure that I will }, it leaves an impression and makes you believe in the impossible.<br /><br />A true vision and masterpiece. Perfect.ves an impression and makes you believe in the impossible.     A true vision and masterpiece. Perfect.

0440238609|1.0|I've just finished the GOLDEN COMPASS and the SUBTLE KNIFE.  The new movie, is being promoted as a Narnia type story, but the books certainly are not.  They are sort of the anti Narnia.  I'm usually very liberal about what I read and watch.  However, I would not recommend these books for kids without careful parental supervision.  These books are very well written, and have an engaging adventure story.  It's probably some of the best writing I've read since the Narnia books.  The first book on it's own isn't overwhelmingly offensive because being the first in a series, you aren't sure what is up or down.  Or, at least I wasn't sure if their quest would be the true quest of the whole story.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just conclude that it draws you into a story that seems innocent enough at first glance, but is not.  I would not recommend them.
B000VT6FAO|3.0|The production sounds very similar to Playing The Angel, though neither the songs nor the album really feel like Depeche Mode, which is fine, since it isn't Depeche Mode.  It sounds better than the blah songs on Playing The Angel (Macro), and worse than the good stuff (Suffer Well, Precious).  It's an adequately written, well produced cd that any fan of Depeche Mode or dark electronic music would appreciate.  It's biggest problem is the problem that most albums have, which is that the songs all sound too similar.  Taken individually, the songs are all solid, but they forget to compliment each other as a whole.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I did not expect all the tracks to be so good. I must say that I did let the media and horrible web sites influence me, and thought that this would be a bad CD. But I should've know better. It's not the first time this happens. I really love the CD, and could not skip a track. You won't regret this one. Put your dancing shoes on, cause this one will keep you on your feet.
B000MX7V5M|4.0|Take a French Riviera retired semi-Robin Hood type jewel thief (Cary Grant). Take a young American heiress on the loose looking for that one good man that her crowd doesn't provide (Grace Kelly). Take an unknown cat thief who is using all of the Cary's old tricks to loot the rich and famous. Put that plot in the hands of Alfred Hitchcock and you have the basis for a sophisticated suspense thriller a la the 1950's. Cary must defend his honor and retire that new thief on the block. Right? A little romance and other high jinxes along the way move the film along but in the end you know justice (and love) will be served.
630522577X|4.0|I've had this saved on my dvr for some time, and was looking forward to seeing this classic, well loved musical. Rex Harrison is terrific in his defining role as Professor Higgins, and Audrey Hepburn is beautiful as the socially challenged Eliza Doolittle.    Now to the script: Professor Higgins makes a bet with a friend that he can transform the street beggar Eliza Doolittle into a socially graceful and desirable woman within six months. He takes her into his home and teaches her the proper way to speak the English language and to dress.     In the process, she (for some strange reason) falls in love with Professor Higgins, even though he is totally lacking in knowing how to treat women. He doesn't think he needs women and wonders why they can't be more like men (duh!!!!!).    Some of the songs are memorable and tremendous, with catchy choruses such as Wouldn't it Be Loverly, The Rain in Spain, Get Me to the Church on Time, and (my favorite) With a Little Bit of Luck. The ending is less than satisfying to say the least, but I suppose for that time, it was realistic. A good experience.
B00003CXC7|4.0|An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York.  Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller.  The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband,  a man not known for showing emotion  openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said.

Her musical talent (other than lipsynching) is amazing and always will be!
0451191153|5.0|\\"The Fountainhead\\" is as relevant, if not more so, today than it was when it was published decades ago.  Still controversial in numerous ways, understanding the philosophy and thoughts conveyed through strong characters and an engaging plot provides for a good book.<br /><br />While dates from the 1920s and 1930s are mentioned a number of times in the book, there is a certain timeless quality to this publication.  The personalities of the well-drawn characters and the action flow seem as if they could be found in a book published just last month.<br /><br />The philosophical underpinnings found in \\"The Fountainhead\\" may not appeal to everyone, but reading this book should provide insight into a particular way of thinking and acting via an engrossing read.<br /><br />Read in conjunction with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", also written by Ayn Rand, one can witness an emerging view of how one author saw the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000068TPN|2.0|Granted, this is a movie, and designed for entertainment, but the subject matter demanded better treatment for the honored dead- of both sides. The book this movie was based on was one of the finest Vietnam histories I've ever had the pleasure and honor to read. So it was with great eagerness that I awaited this film. Mel had access to the book's author,Lt. Gen.Harold G. Moore, as well as all available historical reference materials.So it was with deep regret that I saw Gibson take HUGE liberties with historical facts that were painted onto history's pages with the blood of those brave men. The performances were great; I've always been a Sam Elliot fan; but this doesn't excuse the end result.Do yourself a favor- read the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once And Young\\" if you want to truly capture the feel, as well as the facts of that battle. This is why I coud only give two stars as my rating.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|\\"Okay, so maybe he's bi. Who cares? His cousin can still DRIVE.\\"<br /><br />MSCL is full of best-line-ever-lines like that. It is the only show that forever changed the way words arrange themselves in my head, which I guess kinda makes Holzman (et al) the Joyce of network television.<br /><br />The series finale, ep 19, aired on my 12th birthday--meaning, this show has shaped half of my life.  The amazing thing about MSCL is how much it grows up with you, even though, obviously, the episodes are the exact same 19 episodes they always were.  The writing and acting is so layered, complex and rich that the show affords new meanings and interpretations, even as its viewers \\"grow up.\\"<br /><br />I owned the previous DVD box set, and this one is a major improvement for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Six episodes have commentary w/writers and actors, including Claire Danes in \\"Self-Esteem,\\" Devon Gummersall in \\"Life of Brian,\\" and (my favorite) Wilson Cruz in \\"My So-Called Christmas.\\"<br /><br />2) Extras DVD with cast and a making-of/retrospective featurette, and interviews w/Danes and Holzman.<br /><br />3) Great 36-pg book, lovingly made, with episode liner notes, song lyrics, letters, and other wonderful memorabilia.  Includes notes from Holzman and an essay by Janeane Garofalo.<br /><br />4) Much better title screen/menu, both aestically and functionally. Each disc opens with a 20-sec famous clip (\\"I'm in love/His name is Jordan Catalano...\\" for disc one; Angela's \\"Can you please just explain geometry to me?\\" plea to Brian for disc 4)<br /><br />5) Much better, more streamlined packaging overall.<br /><br />NOTE: I can't comment on image quality between this DVD set and the 2003 one. I watched both on an HDTV w/progressive scan DVD player, and both looked beautiful to me. I have no idea if this DVD set is supposed to look better or enhanced in some way from the previous version--basically, it looks and sounds great.<br /><br />Buy one for yourself and for everyone you know. Even if they're 12.  They'll need it.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Two words: Ti-no.\\"no.\\"
B000V6BE6C|2.0|...and it unfortunately looks like I was right. I absolutely adored and think that City of Evil is one of the best metal albums of all time. It is heavier than hell (with one exception) and just sounds different than any other band. What I don't get is how they took almost the full year to do this thing and it turned out like crap. The only reason I'm giving this thing two stars is A: it's Avenged Sevenfold and B: I give them a whole helluva lot of credit for experimentation. Seriously, they did a lot of experimenting on this album, especially the 9th track. So, I give them credit but this album I'm sorry, but it just blows. Outside of \\"Critical Acclaim\\" the rest of the album I just find rather boring.<br /><br />They need to be very careful now though, because they need to watch out and not go the Blue Oyster Cult way, which is just because you had one \\"lighter\\" song doesn't mean you have to go that route for now on. Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"Seize the Day\\" but they can only do so many ballads. A7X is best when they are playing really heavy stuff, with great guitar work, vocals and interesting lyrics. This album doesn't have a lot of that. I still say the guitar work is still good but it's not as heavy and I really hate to say this but M. Shadows is the weakest link here. His vocals and lyrics are just plain watered down and sappy. He was the man on City of Evil but here, he just comes off whiney without a whole lot to say.<br /><br />My recommendation: buy \\"Critical Acclaim\\" on itunes and skip the rest. Wait 'till their next effort when they realize they totally messed up on this one. But, in the meantime don't write them off. Go see them on tour because they're great live and keep listening to their previous cds especially City of Evil. You won't be disappointed.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Heads-up: This review is for the S3 DVD set as a DVD set, and not an editorial about the quality of Season 3. (For the record, I'd give most S3 episodes a solid 4-stars)  This review is more for the VM fans who don't need to be \\"sold\\" on the series, but are deciding whether to shell-out $45 for the DVDs, given that the last 2 DVD sets were pretty skimpy on the extras.<br /><br />The Season 3 DVD set, while it still doesn't have commentaries (not everyone is as chatty as Matt Groening and Co., I guess), it finally includes a few substantial behind-the-scenes extras, most notably, a 90-minute (or so) discussion with Rob Thomas, who walks us through clips and explains his choices.  Very episode commentary-like, just more efficient-- you go through a lot of good clips from the whole season.<br /><br />Chapters from the RT commentary I especially liked were on favorite guest characters, favorite pairings (Veronica and her dad; VM and Logan; VM and Duncan was not included here, mercifully).<br /><br />It also includes RT's 14-minute mini-episode presentation for the CW heads that takes Veronica to the FBI in season 4.  It's fun to watch, even if it DOES make you kind of sad because it never came to fruition, and instead you now have to sit through a whole convoluted thing of Heroes to see Kristen Bell on TV for 3 minutes. (Hypothetically, of course, as Heroes is, like, awesome!)<br /><br />In conclusion, a good buy for established VM fans who wished for extras on the S1 and S2 DVDs.

B00008MLSH|5.0|I'm not a big opera fan -- have listened sporadically for decades. Every once in a while I newly discover a singer, or a crop of them, and that spurs me to rediscover the wonders of the repertoire. Listening to Anna Nebrebko reminds me of the experience I had when Montserrat Caballe burst on the scene, which will date me for the knowledgeable reader (who will also realize I'm 8 or 10 years behind the present wave with the present singer). This CD presents warhorses as well as some repertoire that's both a little more arcane and more challenging, all from the lyrical and/or bel canto world. Although the performances are not perfect, every moment is gorgeous, and not just the singing. It takes me hours to listen to this CD as well as her \\"Sempre Libera\\" because each excerpt is some variety of showstopper. I generally prefer another species of soprano voice (Natalie Dessay), even in the repertoire here, but for those who love a dark, dramatic, and most often very agile voice, you can't go wrong with this collection. I dismiss quibbles about her pronunciation in non-Slavic languages; her dramatic sense does not flag, at least for me, and her vowels have a musical value that merely starts with the language. I highly recommend this CD.
0316743003|4.0|Skunk Works is the inside story of an organization that has developed some of the most secret and most interesting pieces of aviation technology in modern history.    The author Ben Rich was the head of the Lockheed Skunk Works from 1975 to 1990 and prior to that occupied various positions in the organization for many years including second in command to the originator of the Skunk Works Kelly Johnson.  Skunk Works is all about that organization as seen through the eyes of Ben Rich and he saw most everything while he was there.    The book starts off in Rich's later years as head of the Skunk Works with the development of the F-117 and the origins of stealth technology (essentially the ability to avoid detection by modern radar systems, the holy grail of military aviation supremacy).  After we get the inside story on the F-117 and its development Rich takes us back to earlier projects such as the U2 and the absolutely tremendous Blackbird or SR-71 which even today ranks as one of the most incredible planes ever developed.    While most of the book is devoted to the history of these various projects there is some examination by Rich of the organizational system used by the Skunk Works and how its efficiencies were leveraged.  Some of this information seems a bit dated, but that is not unexpected given that the book was published in 1994.  Still, there are some interesting points that Rich makes in this section regarding the consolidation of companies within the aircraft industry.    Rich's inside knowledge of the trials and tribulations of being on the cutting edge of aviation technology makes for terrific reading.  In addition he has many outside sources from the military and government who give their opinions and perspectives on the various projects, from test pilots to secretaries of defense.  These anecdotes and asides add a lot to the book and really back up the perspective that Rich gives on the Skunk Works organization as one that innovates beyond all others in its industry.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|i got this cd today, and every song is great! gimme mour track 1 is a hugh club it! ware everyone is on the floor dancing! this is Britneys best album hands down! give it a try! even if you dont like Britney! its a hot album!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Brit is back and just in time! The undisputed Pop Princess is on top of her game and ready to get you out on the dance floor humpin and bumpin and shakin your groove thang! She has reclaimed her crown and sat back down on her throne. So disregard all the tabloid crap and give Ms. Spears her due. I think most of that stuff is fabricated anyway. This is fantastic pop product, great dance music, and will get you off your [...] and dancing to the funky beat. Have fun with Blackout and Britney!!!
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Is this a dance record, or left over music from the 1980's?  Ok 1st of all I'm in my late 30's so mabey I don't reach the demographic for a the Britney Spears music fan? But I do love dance music, & to me this is not dance music, I couldn't even dance to this if I tried! I was really expecting something with her latest album, and with all \\"Glowing\\" reviews (Entertainment  Weekly gave her new CD a B? What did they hear?) I was expecting something fun.  After a listen I just think it's laughable crap.  Nothing new or exciting here. Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a 100%better album for dance music. That is 1 dance CD that I never get tired of listening to, & at least you can understand the lyrics!  \\"It's Britney, Bitch!\\" That's how she chooses to start the album, and my immediate response is, \\"I wish it wasn't. \\"Every single song on Miss Spears new CD has her breathing heavy over loud music to cover up her singing, and panting like a stripper and/or a dog in heat, or just plain talking over dance music.  Britney's voice (which has never been her strong point) doesn't even sound like itself half the time. Every trick that you could possibly come up with to disguise the fact that Britney can't carry a tune is employed here in the hopes that we won't actually notice.  \\"Heaven on Earth\\" sounds like some left over 80's song that would be not even be considered a 1 Hit wonder but something you would find at the bottom of a clearance rack. I don't know even it woud qualify has a dance song. \\"Radar\\" just gave me a headache.   \\"Piece of Me,\\" a Spears protest song of sorts against people's judgments and celebrity culture written by the Swedish duo Bloodshy & Avant, her woe-is-me attitude becomes ridiculous.  You'd think someone who's been in the business as long as she has would have the good sense to know that the majority of the lyrics on \\"Blackout\\" are laughable. At one point, Britney's singing \\"I fall off the edge of my mind...\\" over and over again. What the hell does this even mean? Does anyone know?   The songs are just terriable. I hate to attack todays music generation, and the taste of today's youth, but what happend??  Did someone pay for all those glowing reviews??  You may not like her has a person for all the things she pulls in public, or how she treats her kids, but one look at her music talents,  and a person can tell she was talented at 1 time.  I'm sure Britney's fans will find no fault in the album. It's very difficult to judge the album and Britney's life separately, but this is exactly what we should all try to do: draw the line between the woman and the (former) professional, and start out musical explorations of \\"Blackout\\" from there!  \\"Black Out\\" is just dreadful. \\"Blackout\\" is nothing more than a blip on my radar that I'll forget about tomorrow.   My self it's 1 of the \\"Worst Albums of 2007\\"!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I feel Mulholland Drive is David Lynch's best film.  I've seen Blue Velvet and although it is a very good film, this film feels superior.  I was more intrigued by this film and Lynch's over indulgence was kept to a minimum in this one.  There were less moments there for the sake of being there, even though the end with the old people was vintage Lynch, all the way.    This is a hard film to categorize, it's a psychological thriller, at the same time an erotic thriller, and a pyschological drama.  It's a bunch of things, as Lynch does well.  Plus, there's more than enough Lynch moments to satisfy the fan and enough non Lynch moments to satisfy the non fan.  It will take you for a ride and never let go.    The only extra is the theatrical trailer, there's not even a chapter search, really makes you watch the film.  But I'd rather have a chapter feature to go back and find my favorite moments.    Must See.

0618680004|3.0|As a committed agnostic-atheist, this book should speak directly to an audience like me.  In many respects it does.  But there were two specific things that I found disappointing about this book:    First, the sarcastic tone.  Unlike Christopher Hitchens in \\"[[ASIN:0446579807 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]],\\" whose sarcasm is an essential part of an extended polemic, Dawkins' book is ostensibly a \\"scientific\\" work.  Here, the sarcasm is unnecessary and counterproductive.  Dawkins makes many excellent points on the improbability of various religious beliefs.  He would be better served making them from a neutral and objective position, instead of from the emotionally charged territory that animates his tone.  He also has the annoying habit of quoting other authors referring to him or saying something about him, which is unnecessarily self-referential.  In some of the books passages one has the impression of entering into a long-simmering debate between Dawkins and others, where the reader is witness to round four or five of an ongoing imbroglio.    Second, Dawkins dismisses Buddhism as an \\"ethical system\\", essentially ignores Hinduism and other polytheistic religions, and focuses almost entirely on the Abrahamic tradition, and especially Christianity.  I would like to have seen him spend more time with the notions of \\"God\\" from other traditions, even where, such as in Buddhism, there is no obvious reference to an external God. Or to acknowledge some native traditions and their notions of God.  Or even delve a little into Greek and Latin mythology.  But Dawkins ignores these, unlike Hitchens.  So it is the \\"supernatural\\" and \\"superhuman\\" God of the Abrahamic tradition that draws almost all of the fire.    That said, this is in many other ways an excellent book.  For the uninitiated, Dawkins is a British ethologist, evolutionary biologist and popular science writer who holds the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford.  He became well known through his 1976 book \\"[[ASIN:0199291152 The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the Author]],\\" which espouses the gene-centered view of evolution, that selection at the level of organisms or populations almost never overrides selection based on genes. His scientific work very much colors his view of religious traditions, and he spends much time in the book debunking the notion that Einstien was religious, taking issues with Stephen Gould's notion of \\"non-overlapping magisteria\\" between religion and science, and eviscerating creationism, even as dressed up in \\"intelligent design.\\"  Dawkins is an ardent Darwinian, which informs every page of his book.  For those readers who would like a catalog of the improbabilities of msny traditional mainstream religious beliefs, this book is a worthy inclusion on your bookshelves.
B000WSL5Y0|5.0|If not found on the first day, only ten percent of missing children stories end happily.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" starts on day three.  A four year old girl is missing, and her aunt reaches out to novice Detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) to find the little girl.  In a meager Boston neighborhood where people don't talk to the cops, Kenzie knows the drug dealers, barflies and other seedier residents of the community that live behind a wall the police can't penetrate.  People talk to him, and the more he learns about the devastated mother, the more complicated the story becomes.       Enough about the plot, because it twists and turns to a conclusion about which viewers should know little.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a plot-based film, a neo-noir mystery where each answer comes with two new questions.  Several times the film seems ready to close its doors, only to open a darker, uglier room and lead us to it.        My greatest praise for first time director Ben Affleck concerns his casting, highlighted by Amy Ryan who seems destined to receive an Oscar nomination for her role as the worst mother seen since Million Dollar Baby.  It's no coincidence that an Eastwood movie gets a mention here, as his recent films ripple throughout \\"Gone Baby Gone\\".  The texture and sense of community reflect \\"Mystic River\\" (both novels were penned by Dennis Lehane), while the conflicted dilemma facing Patrick Kenzie plays out like the euthanasia question from Million Dollar Baby.       Not since Eastwood's boxing picture has such a morally ambiguous story unfolded on screen, where questions of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" are muddied by life, which rarely plays along on ethical issues.  The biggest shock for me in the film is that Ben Affleck (whose reputation is that of a New England liberal) points a finger directly at the drug culture, irresponsible parenting and sexual predators for much of the pain and suffering in this country.  There's no mention of the war or corrupt businesses or climate change; rather, Affleck holds a mirror up to the Jerry Springer underbelly of America...and shows something very ugly.
B00005K3O4|3.0|It made my sides hurt.<br /><br />Yes, three stars, but this is an average.  One star for production values and acting (except John Vernon), five stars for a great concept (no matter how poorly executed), and slapstick humor.<br /><br />It was a LOW budget horror spoof...  Everything was clearly done on a bare bones budget.  The actors were mostly consistent with the budget, with one notable exception.  John Vernon plays a jaded, cynical street monster of a cop, and does a superb job of showing the resentment for anyone with college education, and anyone with the bad manners to be young.  Bravo.<br /><br />The concept was utterly camp, aliens invade Santa Cruz California (having visited there recently, I'm not sure anyone there would notice), and they look like clowns.  Using popcorn guns, cotton candy cocoons, and ballon tracking dogs (balloon dogs, for tracking that is) they begin their conquest, or at least dinner.  Yes, they eat people, draining their blood through a crazy straw.  Whimisical, surreal, groteque, and playing on the scarriest thing on two legs; clowns.  Of course, being clowns, everything was slapstick, and mostly well done.  I like it.  I just wish a little more effort and budget went into it.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project burst on the scene in the mid 1970s with the highly acclaimed Tales of Mystery and Imagination. But it is their follow-up, I Robot, that is unusually both their best album and their greatest commercial success. At a time when disco and its antidotal punk rock were in their ascendancies, I Robot proved to be a godsend for those who liked neither.  Though the radio-friendly hit I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You took a grudging bow to discomania, I Robot took the listener down a progressive musical path that had been largely abandoned at that time by both fans and critics. Because there is none of the pomposity and symphonic pretensions of some of the bands that nearly killed the genre earlier in the decade, I prefer to term Parsons' style \\"prog-lite\\".  I like the whole CD but especially enjoy the mesmerizing title cut, the hard-hitting I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You, the paranoiac's anthem The Voice, and the stately neo-Floydian Genesis Ch.1 V.32. The touted bonus cuts are quite unnecessary, they neither add to nor detract from the musical grandeur of the album.  I Robot is one of the few albums that I liked from the mid-70s that hadn't been reissued until recently. When I noticed that has now been done, I snapped it up on sight. It sure sounded great when I played it through the first time! If you liked this album when it was current and hadn't heard it in years, do yourself a favor and pick it up while the reissue is still available.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|To me, better than In the Zone.  May have been rushed to market and ridiculously leaked, but still has some of Brit's best.<br /><br />These are the 5 best on the album.  Break the Ice being the best, followed by a tie for second with Gimme More & Ooh Ooh Baby -- third claimed by Radar, followed by Hot as Ice.<br /><br />1. Gimme More<br />3. Radar<br />4. Break The Ice<br />9. Hot As Ice<br />10. Ooh Ooh Baby<br /><br />Yes it's very produced, though not as much as some older albums; yes, she has been in the public eye for some not-so-great-things -- still the album is fun, a good listen, and if you've liked any Britney songs before, you will most likely enjoy this one.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|When did media attention start to equal actual talent? Because if that's how we measure talent these day then yes, Britney Spears, as well as Justin Timberlake for example, are probably the most talented people around. What solid production can do for an album is shown here. I'm not saying that it's a bad album but that it's definitely not Britney's talent that shines here but that of the producers.
0060760273|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old got this book for Christmas last year.  It is her favorite book.  It is also lots of fun to read.  I don't know why something so simply written is so good, but it just is.  The pictures do alot to keep her attention and stir her growing imagination.  I highly recommend this book for young children.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Our local theatre only has one screen so some movies eventually get shown several weeks or even a month after the release date. But there was a strange rarity when Spider-Man 3 along with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End where shown the same time everyone else got to. So rather than watching the film a month later with all the disappointment and negative comments, I discovered along with everyone else that the third Spidey installment was just...iffy. Not outright terrible by any means but it just is; it doesn't transcend the genre and go from a good comic book movie to a great movie period like 2 was but rather this was just entertaining but not consistently.    The film starts out with Peter Parker/Spider-Man happy as can be with a great girlfriend with Mary Jane who's on Broadway and Peter thinking about proposing. But the attention gets to Peter's head and he becomes a little arrogant and oblivious to certain problems which gets worse when Harry Osborne, furious with the knowledge Parker may be responsible for his father's death, is coming after him.    As if they're needed to be more problems, escaped convict Flint Marko, the now-prime suspect in Uncle Ben's murder, has been mutated thanks to an experiment and can change his body's composition to mimic sand. Then of course there's Eddie Brock with a mind for being New York's top photographer, and a strange substance that latches onto Peter and turns him into something no one wants him to be.    PHEW! Man it was tough writing all that because as most people have already said, this film is stuffed to the point where the button its pants would fly off and hit someone in the face by now. There's just way too much going on from storylines to villains to scenes and set-pieces yet at the same time the film doesn't have the strong pacing the second film had which is odd to say the least. Each storyline in essence deserves its own film so to boil it all down to one 2 hour 13 minute movie makes it too scattered.Then of course there's individual scenes (I highly suggest skipping chapter 36 to make the film run much smoother) to dialogue, handling of \\"emo Peter\\" complete with Conor Oberst haircut to the introduction of Gwen Stacy which seems to be written in as if to say to Spider-Man fans \\"see? we have Gwen too, now watch us\\".    However, the effects, save a few scenes have definately gotten better, and the slightly darker tone is quite appropriate and even welcome and of course the action scenes are just as awesome as they should be. And despite the awful dialogue (at times), the actors do at least do a respectable job with their roles like Thomas Haden Church as Marko/Sandman and even Topher Grace, an oddball choice, is actually good at playing Brock. This is the kind of film where there's enough great parts but it comes after bad or even laughable parts so you're kind of glad there's at least something good in it.    It's obviously not the worst comic book movie; what with Ghost Rider, Elektra and the Punisher out there but in a strange way, this is like the Batman Forever of the franchise: it's watchable sure but man, problems are coming out of its pores.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Her personal life might be in shambles at the moment but this album just proves that Britney can still make an amazing record no matter what.  Each track on this album is a potential hit...which is very rare with most albums. It is a dance album that you can't sit down and listen too....you just have to get up and dance.  This is my rating of each track    Gimme more - 5/5 - great opener...\\"It's Britney, B**ch\\"  Piece of me - 5/5 - the critics favorite...great track...no other words to describe it...go give it a listen  Radar - 5/5  Break the Ice - 4.5/5  Heaven on Earth - 5/5 - a really beautiful song that makes you want to dance at the same time  Get Naked - 4/5 - it is quite catchy but it snot my favourite song on the album  Freakshow - 4.5/5  Toy Soldier - 5/5 - absolutly my favourite track on the album. This song has to be be a single.  Hot as ice - 5/5  Ooh Ooh Baby - 5/5  Perfect Lover - 4/5 - this one and break the ice are so similar to me...but I like Break the ice better  Why should I be sad - 4.5/5 - the closest thing to a ballad on the album, its about her relationship with k-fed...makes a good closer to the album.

1591841666|1.0|This book is  fun to read, but not as a businessbook where you want to learn something amazing o useful. Common senses and basics are so obvious, the author is repeating in a thousand of different forms the same idea which is boring. The idea of this book can be condensed in only a short paragraph : if you can and will pass the dip, then go ahead, and if you don`t, just reallocate your resource to other project and quit.
B00007GZR5|2.0|*Production*<br />The movie is visually pleasant, full of vibrant colors and beautiful images.  At times, the settings look nearly identical to Kincaid paintings.  While nice, it gets to be a bit too much to watch.<br /><br />*Acting*<br />Robin Williams parrots every \\"serious\\" role he's ever played.  Annabella Sciorra is incredible (meaning lacking credibility) as a grieving mother and wife.  Sure, she does a great job of being \\"depressed\\" but there's something robotic about her grief.<br /><br />*Script and Dialog*<br />One word: campy.<br /><br />*Spiritual matters*<br />The skeleton for the plot is, more or less, a traditional Christian understanding of heaven and hell. Superimposed over top of that are beliefs of all sorts of other faiths and philosophies.  The result: heaven and ell that are completely defined by each individual inhabitant, a heaven and hell of the mind.  Heaven is escapable through reincarnation and hell through believing in one's self or forgiving one's self.  If it were only that easy, would there be a hell at all?<br /><br />I would have given this film 1 star if it weren't for the one great lesson (reminder, really), I took from the film: love those around you and cherish your time with them.  You'll never know when that kiss, that goodbye, that hug, that smile, will be the last.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|\\"Blackout\\" is a great album! The producers Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills and the Swedish duo Bloodshy & Avant did a fabulous job putting together Britney's comeback release. I've never been a huge fan of electro-pop but the style happens to be what makes Blackout a music sensation. The lyrics closely mirror her life and the music mixes are top notch.  If you loved the single \\"Toxic,\\" you'll love this entire album.<br /><br />I can't help but ask myself, after seeing her on the MTV Music Awards, whether or not she can carry this album with a tour, which needs to be done because that's what Britney's career was built on.<br /><br />All in all, there isn't anything bad about this album.  It's Britney at her finest, personal life aside.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Although Britney may have lost some fans, she still has what it takes to take the crown of \\"Queen of Pop\\" from Madonna. Do not let her personal life fool you, this album should not be viewed in context of her personal life; the masterpiece cannot be judged with its creator. On that note, this is her best work yet. Britney has not created an album which the majority of the tracks are hit-capable. With tracks such as \\"Gimme more,\\" Britney emphasizes the beat of the track to make you groove. The majority of her songs on \\"Blackout\\" are danceable, proving that there is still much \\"Toxic\\" left in her. Songs, like \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Toy Soldier,\\" are the types of songs that many listeners will enjoy, as they are fun, quirky, and most importantly, danceable. Britney accentuates the beat of all her songs as the main force that drives the songs to greatness. I highly recommend this album to cruise around on a Saturday night to the clubs. This is a highly enjoyable album and it will definately grow on you.

0060723513|1.0|When I read this book I was unaware of the controversy surrounding it. I found it obviously fiction. Without knowing too much about Australia. I think it is just obvious from the way it is narrated. Whoever has ever lived in a foreign country knows that fitting into another culture rarely goes that easy - but for the author even delving into a tribal culture went almost without pain. Not surprising, because the aboriginees in the book share her values anyway, they understand everything basically in the same way a new agey westerner would, except that they just incredibly morally integer. And they remain very artifial figures - completely idealised.    It is known that tribal cultures have often extremely complicated rules. That family and clan relations are incredibly complicated in indigenous Australian cultures is almost a stereotype - but nothing of that in the book. Also, the life of men and women is often segregated in traditional cultures - of course not in this book. I imagine that living the life of a hunter/gatherer was never picking flowers, and to my knowledge people in Australia and elsewhere used to hunt/gather in small groups, but often had to starve. However in the book a group of more than sixty people never has trouble to find food - animals etc seem just to jump in front of them to provide meals  (except once, but that's part of the spiritual development program specially provided to suit the demands of the author). By the way there seems to be a slight contradiction in the book between the easy hunting/gathering described and the claim that this very special tribe has decided to give up reproducing because hunting/gathering has become too hard.     Obviously the very special tribe unknown to any Anthropologist waited for this very special woman from Texas to come, and made her the very special messenger of their very special message to the world. Am I alone in having the impression that new agey people referring themselves as lion dreamers are more often than not a narcissistic pain in the arse? The author want to make us even believe that native Australians believe in UFOs - come on, only Americans believe in that rubbish!
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|Bob Dylan is the greatest and most influential songwriter in rock history. Like Shakespeare before him, artists and poets will reinvent and replay his music. Even though Bob is still with us, this is one of the first real examples of the future of Dylan's music. It is strange hearing various artists and bands play music heard hundreds if not thousands of times. Each artist here tweaks and reworks the song in a way to make it their own while keeping the spirit of the song intact. I would recommend this album to hardcore Dylan fans like me and to those who never got into Dylan's music because they didnt care for his voice. This album makes you look at Dylan from a different angle and the result is still absorbing, frustrating but ultimately supremely rewarding.
B0000894RZ|5.0|Originally pegged by some critics as a clone of white female pop stars like Kylie Minogue or Susanna Hoffs, Lisa Stansfield boldly proved them all wrong by instead becoming possibly the finest white female soul singer since Teena Marie. She first burst onto the scene in 1990 with the hits \\"All Around The World\\" and \\"You Can't Deny It\\". Her rich, beautiful voice is probably at its glorious best on the 1991 #1 R&B hit \\"All Woman\\" which is an intense and powerful anthem for strong-willed, independent women everywhere. The 1991 non-hit \\"First Joy\\" is also catchy and melodic. She hit once more in 1997 with \\"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,\\" and this affordable, well chosen hits collection is a good way to get most or all of her best work.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This set of DVD's in BluRay played on a 1080p high def TV presents a view of the earth that is beyond belief.  The colors are so vivid and the images so sharp that you would think you were actually there.  How the photographers obtained some of these images would be really interesting to know.  I can't say enough good things about this set of DVD's, I will be rewatching then over again and showing them to friends who don't have access to this visual feast.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Britney Spears returns with a album that is heavy on the dance and Groove and compliments what she does best. she doesn't have the vocal range of Beyonce,but she doesn't need it because she carrys alot of weight as a Stylist with presenting a song and making it work. these tracks are catchy and work. she stays in her musical zone and makes it work.  not a Bad Album and it is Pretty Good.it's a typical britney Album,but it has alot of catchy tracks.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Many people have already criticized this album saying that it is too \\"mainstream\\" or simply doesn't deliver on any promises the band has made regarding it.  This isn't true and the album delivers on all fronts if you really understand what the band was trying to accomplish.  They have always stated that they are trying to change the sound of their music constantly and that every album has a different approach.  This album is no different and if you are listening to it without expecting a copy of their previous albums, then you will really enjoy it.   Every song has new sounds and angle of lyrics not previously heard on other records.  The only complaint is that much of the album sounds a little too overproduced and tends to take away from the edgy and metal sound.  It is much more poppy and chorus driven.  This album works for anyone who truly is a A7X fan or anyone who only really liked their city of evil album.  If you were dissapointed with City of Evil and were hoping the band produced another waking the fallen or sounding the seventh trumpet, then you will most likely be dissapointed.

0143038419|5.0|This book is a winner! While I listened to the book on CD, read by the author herself, I felt like I was taking the journey right along with her. Listening to her voice, she quickly sounded to me like an old friend telling the fascinating story of her travels abroad (much of it enjoyably unpredictable).  Although this book is cataloged in the travel section, it fits into other categories as well: adventure, self-help, biography, travel, spirituality, relationships, and more. I loved reading about all the people she met, especially the healer who cured Gilbert's \\"female\\" infection with some weird potion made out of plants.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Basically from start to finish the album is a little different then her previous music ,this cd is like a upgrade and a good one.Each song has different beats and sounds such as Gimme More,Break The Ice,Radar,and more,some of the songs are done by danja who great at producing them, the rest of the album will not disappoint and Britney shows her fans and non fans that when she comes back she comes back hard.5/5
0812580346|4.0|This is my first novel by Robert J. Sawyer, and I enjoyed it.  FLASH FORWARD is an interesting story that deals with time travel, and the very concept of what the future truly is.  For the most part, I found the book to be a real page turner, and I thought the beginning was genuinely terrific.<br /><br />But Sawyer does not strike me as a novelist who is very skilled at characterization.  Most of the characters in FLASH FORWARD are pretty flat.  Sawyer pretty much tells us how they feel, as opposed to showing their feelings in a dramatic fashion.  There are also too many characters, and many supporting characters are simply not very well developed.  Still, I liked the main characters enough to stick with them to the end of the story.<br /><br />The science in this novel is rather complex, and some of the scientific dialgoue between the characters pretty much went over my head.  I am not a hardcore SF reader, so perhaps others would feel differently.  But a casual reader might find some sections of this book to be rather technical and dry.  I know I did.  Also, like many of the other reviewers, I found the ending to be somewhat rushed and disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, though, FLASH FORWARD is an entertaining read, and I plan to read some of Sawyer's other work.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I love this CD..I'm buying several for friends as gifts..To support my girl.  This is the best CD Britney has released.  I love every track...Radar, Break the Ice and Heaven on Earth are my fav's though.  For Britney fans I recommend this CD...For the haters..Stop hatin sometimes..You dont like britney fine..but this CD is hot..
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have been a Britney fan from day one, but I will be the first to admit her albums usually had four or five good tracks and then a bunch of filler.    With her personal life in the toilet her new album Blackout somehow managed to be the unexpected and actually be her best album ever.  You might not approve of her personal life but that does not mean her album isn't a smash.    Nearly every track on the album is single worthy from the first release 'Gimme More' to upcoming singles 'Hot as Ice' and the albums best track the media/paparazzi slamming 'Piece of Me' in which Britney attacks the media that find it newsworthy everytime she even leaves the house to get groceries.    If you are a fan of great dance/pop music pick up this cd.  If you are looking for deep intellectual escape pass on it but then why would you think about getting it anyways?
B00004X10B|5.0|My current equipment consists of a rebel XT, 75-300 4-5.6, a 50 1.8, a 17-85 4-5.6 IS, a 580EXII flash (truly excellent), mini tripod, spare batteries and charger, Cleaning Kit (The big one with the little spatula for cleaning the sensor), Lens hoods for the two big lenses, misc filters, and a full size cheap-o tripod. I took this bag out for the first time on our Disney Cruise and found myself with room to spare for everything I may ever need. The problem with this is before, when using a random old camera bag I had for my cheap-o video camera,  all I could take was the body, and lenses. Now I can fit all this other stuff, and it is just too big to take with you for a day at Disney. I find myself wanting a smaller bag for daily carrying around, and using this bag for major traveling. It is comfortable, but heavy due mostly to accumulation of items.. (OOH Look! I can fit this thingy over here!. I might need a Russian nuclear submarine today, Ill stash it here!) Its fastening system is good, though I find myself using the plastic buckles more than the zipper, and the tripod carrying loop, uh.. carries a tripod. Only complaint is that my cheapo tripod sticks out past the edges of the bag, so I find myself banging it into walls and hallways sometimes.     Pros:   Big  Configurable  Sturdy  Comfortable    Cons:  Big  Irresistible urge to fill it with more items... (L Lenses...)

0525950079|4.0|\\"World Without End\\" is epic in its intended scope and its ambition and overall it almost gets away with these pretensions.  Ken Follett is a masterful writer who delivers plenty of interesting prose and characters, drawing skillfully on the book's hugely admired predecessor, \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"  He is, at times, ill-served by his editors who did not catch blatant repetitions of characters' descriptions and dialogue.  The book progresses through chronological episodes that are generally interesting though, by any standard, can be described as overly formulaic.  The main characters move forward with their lives, but always run into reversals of fortune that block them from reaching their hearts' desires.  This is followed by some return of fortune and then the whole cycle begins again in the next chapter.  Where author Ken Follett is most successful, I think, is in presenting the conflicts of the period--clergy against merchant class; peasants against feudal landowners, etc.  There is a feel of authenticity in these parts of the story.<br />Some reviewers have found fault with the perceived 21st Century sensibilities that Follett is accused of building into this book, but I'm not sure that the criticism is valid.  There are many historical accounts of a less hidebound morality present in the 14th Century where \\"World Without End\\" is set.  Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" and Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" both suggest that the average person was less hung up about sexual activity and variations than the post-Victorians (including our modern selves).  In any event, the sex in this book is not nearly as distracting as the often predictable turns of the plot.<br />I think that this is an entertaining book and worth the time and price as long as the reader does not assume that he/she is taking on another \\"War and Peace.\\"
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|The two songs that make sense on this CD are Dark Road and Big Sky.<br /><br />The music video of Dark Road is worth the price of admission to this CD.<br />The visuals work perfectly with the song.

B000174LVQ|4.0|Went to the performance in Neve Zohar, Israel (October 2007) and afterwards wanted to buy a CD as close to what I heard as I could.  This CD isn't it: it doesn't have the melodious flute (?) or the various percussions, and is less instrumental as such.  This CD's emphasis is [Andalusian?] vocals with Paco on the guitar.  So initially it was a disappointment as I was hoping for something else, more varied.  But, the more I listen to it, the more the quality rings through and I really enjoy it.  Although I do hope that in the future there will be a disc of the performance with all the musicians in his group.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|No joke.  I gave this album - Britney Spears' Blackout - 5 out of 5 stars.  No, I'm not drunk...nope, nor am I high or in any altered mental state right now.  Unless, of course, you can count Blackoutmania as a form of drug, because if it is I, and any pop music fan that finds the fallen pop princess' latest record as intoxicating, have been mental since October.  Simply put, Blackout is the best album (as a whole) that Spears has ever delivered.  Though she's had singles (and, boy, has she had singles!), the CDs they came from always sounded a bit off-kilter, like a lot of the best songs were included at the beginning so, by the end, you were so overwhelmed by the amazing sounds of the first that you completely disregarded most of the ending.  In the Zone, of course, ended up being the exception (\\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\" are startlingly beautiful, completely un-cheesy songs)...almost.  It had some simmering moments and one scorcher, the infamous Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" but overall it lacked much material that could be listened to over and over and over and over and over and...well, you understand.  2007's brilliant Blackout breaks this tradition and is a completely enthralling piece of ear candy from start to finish.  From the blazing radio hit \\"Gimme More\\" (ok, people, I know it's a bit repetitive, but the \\"gimme gimme more gimme more gimme gimme more\\"'s are meant to get stuck in your head--that's what great pop music choruses are about!) and Top 10 paparazzi and public haters basher \\"Piece of Me\\" to third single (and one of Brit's best songs EVER) \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Hot as Ice,\\" this disc is pop perfection in terms of likability, playability and production.  Sure, it's often hard to distinguish Britney as a singer over the course of some of the tracks that use her voice more like just another instrument to be tweaked with in the studio, but that's part of its magic.  Like it or not, the girl has a unique sound that is, despite its mediocrity, has a quality thatis instantly distinguishable; on every song she's had on any record over the past decade, Spears has been able to present herself as a capable singer in terms of how each song suits her voice perfectly.  Blackout is, as mentioned earlier, about production, and what marvelous production it has!  \\"Gimme More\\" starts out with the infamous \\"It's Britney...\\" (that alone proves its merit) and a somewhat bland beat, but as the lyrics and Spears' nasally soprano take over it's instantly catchy, and this is large part due to Danja's amazing studio skills; \\"Piece of Me\\" is just the same, delivered by the Grammy-winning team who brought the world \\"Toxic,\\" showcasing that it really is about the song as a whole rather than separating it into the vocalist (Britney), the songwriters and the production team.  So am I claiming that Blackout is perfect?  No.  \\"Let Go\\" (an unreleased song written and recorded for this project, though never making it on record) would have been a MUCH better closing number rather than the extremely bland \\"Why Should I Be Sad,\\" and \\"Perfect Lover\\" can get a little tiring after subsequent listens (the bridge is awesome when it breaks into harmonies, though), but overall Britney Spears has delivered her best album to date, a piece of modern-day pop that shines through the current radio's Hip Hop mediocrity.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This cd is not Springsteens best but it is a very good album.  Like a fine wine Bruce definately getsn better with age.

0525950079|5.0|Any time I have a book that is a guaranteed page turner, I'm a happy person.  I loved Pillars so much, that I almost expected to be disappointed in the sequel.  I was hoping that even if it was 70% as good as Pillars, I wouldn't be let down.  Well, I'm happy to say that it is at least 90% as good.  (Would be almost impossible to be as good as Pillars.)  Needless to say, i am very pleased with Follett's new epic.  This is so his genre.
B000UR366S|5.0|This is one of the move beautiful CDs ever. you can see her interviews about this CD on youtube. They have her performances from the beginning of her career until the present. What a doll!<br />In addition to having all her albums/CDs/DVDs a lot of the other artists I listen to cover her songs when I only bought their CDs to hear them.
B00005JPFH|1.0|Terribly, boring.  Computer effects look cheesy.  I wish Aunt Mae and Mary Jane would die already.  Clumsy script.  It's like every minute you watch feels like ten excruciating minutes.  Couldn't care less about any of the characters and I'm a Sam Raimi fan.  Tobey Macquire looks ill.  It's two and a half hours long. I could go on and on like this movie but I think you get the point.  You want a great super hero movie rent Batman Begins or Xmen2.  daredevil is even better.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Holy shizz. I'm having a moment of pure bliss. Easily the best album I've heard this year, bar none. Don't let this lady's personal life get you caught up. We all personally know someone who's more messed up than her, I mean come on. This is Brit-Brit at her best. Sexy, fierce, and about to hit the top again. You gotta respect a woman who can put out something this damn good when she's hit all these obstacles. I'm totally rocking out in my house having a fricken dance party with my ipod, it's that hot.
0061547832|1.0|How disappointing. I've concluded this book is nothing more than a ego boasting rant from the Donald. But that is no surprise, he is a trust fund boomer who used his loads of money his daddy had to build on what he already has. So how is this book going to help you? It doesn't but if you like to take advice from someone who is wealthy to begin with and stroke their ego then buy this book. There are not pointers for wealth management or how to aquire wealth, how could there be? HE WAS BORN RICH! I would suggest reading a book written by a maverick who made their money on their own and built an solid business with it.
159102594X|3.0|I see a lot of 5 star reviews and while The Blade Itself is an adequate opener to Abercrombie's writing career, I'd encourage a little tempering of the excitement.      The book suffers from overdrawn plotlines, Jezel in particular.  Here we have an unlikable and uninteresting character who plods through inaction for page after page.  I found myself completely unconcerned about about him and his love interest.  The whole contest story fell flat as well and was typical of other fantasy, eg. Feist's Talon of the Silver Hawk (skip it), and others.  I'd say Steven Erikson does it better in the Malazan Book of the Fallen.    Aside from the plodding action however, the excitement does pick up towards the end, which is why I'm guessing we see the abundance of 5 star reviews.  The last 1/4 of the book was 4 or 4 1/2 star material.  There are enjoyable characters in this book like Glotka, Logan, and the Arch Lector, but also dull ones like Jezel.  There are also a few storylines that are too brief and disjointed to allow any depth.      All in all this is pretty average fantasy.  I will admit that the ending gets the blood flowing (literally for the characters and figuratively for the reader) and the last couple of chapters make the whole thing almost worthwhile.  If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would. It doesn't follow the stereotypical Tolkien or Rowling formula (a plus in my book), but still doesn't excite throughout like Erikson or some others.
B00005JPLW|3.0|I liked the movie but thought the extra disk seemed unnecessary as the commentary was very short.
0375842209|5.0|Someone in our synagogue suggested this book to me. I was surprised that I  hadn't heard of it before. It is called The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. It  was published in September of this year.    It is a wonderful book. I couldn't stop reading it and read it in a couple  of days. It is about the Holocaust, but the main character is a young girl  who isn't Jewish. The narrator is death. The author is 30 years old and from  Australia. Just a fascinating book.    The first few pages are a bit off putting, but that is  because it is Death speaking and it may seem confusing at first. Don't let  that deter you. If you understand that death is speaking, it will be easier  to understand when you start reading.    After I finished the book, I went back and reread the beginning with new eyes. It is quite wonderful.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Remember when Shadows and Gates were in the Good Charlotte video? Were their new songs going to sound like Good Charlotte or something super commercial? Luckily it doesn't on this album. Almost Easy definitely has a rock radio feel but who cares? If its a good song, I don't care if it fits the radio format. I'd rather hear bands I like than some cutter garbage many of us are so used to hearing. But to each their own.    A Little Peace of Heaven has a Mr Bungle meets Tim Burton type of vibe to it. It's a wacked out song that kind of feels like a theatrical play and it will be interesting to see how they play this one live. THere is definitely some Helloweenish european metal going on during the intros of Lost, Afterlife and Unbound.     The biggest complain I have on the album is that the guitar mix is kinda too low. You could definitely hear everything on the previous 3 albums. It feels like it doesn't stand out in certain songs. Maybe thats the price of producing it yourself? Still a kick$$$ album.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|On a remix of Jadakiss' Why, Common pondered, \\"Why they hype Britney up, they know she cant sing?\\" The simple answer was she could sell albums. Back when she was the number one pop princess she got the best songwriters, producers, and chorographer and elaborate stage shows. But all those people a currently working with the likes of Rihanna and the Pussycat Dolls. So instead of working with someone like Timbaland, Britney had to settle for a Timbaland lackey Nate Hills to help write and produce half of the songs on Blackout which come out sounding just a step above the Paris Hilton album. What's worse if he starts speaking over Gimme More talking about how amazing Britney is. Who does he think he is, Puff Daddy? At least Diddy had a few actually hit under his belt before he pulled that stuff.    Without Max Martin or Diane Warren around, the lyrics are even worse than stale beats. E-Mail My Heart seems Dylanesque compared to some of the songs on Blackout. Piece of Me is Britney's backlash at the press and paparazzi which would have been a little more meaningful had she actually had a hand in writing it. Hot as Ice, co-written by T-Pain, is just one cheesy metaphor after another. And yes she also mentions in the song that she is also \\"Cold as fire.\\" Then Get Naked (I Got a Plan) and Freakshow, where Britney inexplicably raps, will most likely be Exhibit U and V in Kevin Federline's plan to get full custody.    The songs basically are just one bad techno track bleeding into each other which may work at a rave while on mind altering drugs, but for those of you that are sober, the album is as bad as you could expect. But at least Britney can in solace that it is better than her ex-husband's. But not by much. Here is usually where I suggest a song to download but you are better off saving your money. Unless of course you are one of those annoying semi-ironic people, then go ahead and get the \\"It's Britney (expletive deleted)\\" ringtone so you can be the biggest tool on your block.
0525950079|4.0|I could not wait for this sequel and I'm not disappointed.  The story is very much like Pillars of the Earth in many aspects.  It's not difficult to recognize similarity of the characters: Merthan is Jack the Builder, Caris is Alaina and Sir Richard is the dastardly William. It is clearly a new age. Women are more vocal, it's sexier, and the building and fleece trade are more 'modern' to the time. While it is a very good read, Pillars is still my favorite book of all time.

The HD quality is astounding and excellent and great and super and fun-times producing.  EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY!!! Highly recommended!
B000W1V44I|5.0|It has been more than a hot minute since this band was at the top of their commercial peak, but their creative peak may have just turned the corner. Most of the album is what you would expect from this group, some dance numbers mixed in with pop ballads. The difference here is that all of these songs have hooks. This is twice the album of their 2005 comeback \\"Never Gone,\\" despite losing a member their vocals sound better than ever. The lead single \\"Inconsolable\\" manages to develop a killer hook just as good as their earlier smash hits although it sounds a little like it is from the late 1990's. Some of the more impressive tracks sound a little more innovative and contemporary. Using the term \\"innovative\\" to describe an aging boy band is not something I would usually do, but witness the closing track \\"Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon\\" and its Beatlesque arrangements and pitch-perfect harmonies, and while these \\"boys\\" may not have reinvented the wheel, they have reinvented themselves. Everyone grows up, but this group is aging quite gracefully.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|We've all read the headlines, we've all seen the interviews, we've all winced at the news reports, and we all cringed at the MTV performance. As I read, saw, winced, and cringed right along with you, in the back of my mind though I knew that none of that was what was really important. The real question was, can this bitch still deliver a good album? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. Not only is \\"Blackout\\" a good album, it's arguably, but in my opinion her best ever.<br /><br />One of the smaller, more pertinent controversies surrounding this album is Britney's proclamation that she is a legend, something which is stated twice on the album, once by producer Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills and again by herself. Many would argue \\"How can this pro-tooled pop tart whose studio vocals have more layers than a croissant call herself a legend?\\" To that  question I ask: Who else could release a single and have it skyrocket into the top 5 with no real promotion, open one of the largest music award shows of the year, give it the best ratings it's had in years, with the most anticipated performance of the year, pushing out some other customarily more deserving previously scheduled performer, mind you still with no physical single or album title, stumble through that performance drunken and out of shape, and still have their album leaked on the internet to so much demand that the record label has to push the album release forward two weeks all while remaining too unbothered to even take a new photo for the album cover (even though she should have because this one is overused and horrid)? There are other pop starlets who are so skinny their collarbones fashionably protrude from their chests and others with five octave vocal ranges who don't even have a fraction of the clout that Britney has or the attention she receives. If that's not a legend I don't know what is? Like her or not, name another bitch who could get away with it?... Thought so.<br /><br />Of the twenty or so tracks leaked onto the internet, Britney and her collaborators chose, finished and reworked, and retitled a little more than half of them and added on a few new tracks for good measure. Half the fun of listening to the Britney leak was trying to predict which songs would make the cut. All of my predictions we're correct.<br /><br />Now to the album, it starts off with the ubiquitous, omnipresent, totally unavoidable song of the late summer, \\"Gimme More\\", by as it's producer Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills calls her \\"The legendary Miss Britney Spears.\\" We all know it, we all love it, though we still haven't decided which \\"more\\" we like best, Britney's short one, the long, deep demonic sounding one, or the almost orgasmic one. I like the orgasmic one myself. I really love the unofficial \\"Gimme More (remix)\\" feat. TI, which I wish could get an official release as a b-side or something.<br /><br />The coolest thing about \\"Piece Of Me\\" and the album's closing and only ballad \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" is that these are songs about Britney's life, not written by Britney. While most people would scoff at such a biographical concept I see it as kinda cool. It's almost as though Britney said to the writers \\"Look guys, you've read the headlines. You've seen the news reports. Ummmm... write a song about me and lemme know when it's done. Kay, love ya. Bye.\\" The vocally morphed, edgy, \\"Piece Of Me\\" produced by Bloodshy & Avant has a first line that says:<br /><br />  \\"I'm Miss American Dream since I was seventeen...\\"<br /><br />  and a chorus that says:<br /><br />  \\"I'm Mrs. lifestyles of the rich and famous (You want a piece of me)<br />  I'm Mrs. oh my God, that Britney's shameless (You want a piece of me)<br />  I'm Mrs. extra extra, this just in (You want a piece of me)<br />  I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin (You want a piece of me)\\"<br /><br />You notice how she's married to the things mentioned in the chorus but not married to being Miss American Dream? Interesting.<br /><br />The Pharrell Williams written and produced \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" (aka \\"Stupid Things\\") which in a roundabout way basically tells the story of the breakup of Britney, the millionaire, from her, not as wealthy, some would even say opportunistic, ex-husband, Kevin Federline contains this lyric:<br /><br />  \\"I sent you out to Vegas<br />  With a pocket full of paper...\\"<br /><br />Ouch!<br /><br />\\"Radar\\" (produced by Bloodshy & Avant and contains some of the same sounds as Rihanna's hit \\"SOS\\") and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" (aka \\"Fillin' Me Up\\") are the lighter, more poppy songs of the album, one that's mostly filled with dark, hard hitting dance beats that flirt on the edge of R&B. These two songs though are reminiscent of those from past Britney albums, just with racier lyrics. The last one \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" is penned by Kara DioGuardi, whose writing talents have been utilized by other female pop acts such as Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, and Miley Cyrus aka \\"Hannah Montana.\\" \\"Ooh...\\", though not terrible is the least edgy, polished, or sophisticated of all the tracks and sounds out of step with the other songs. It's the only song that I was surprised to have seen make the cut.<br /><br />The techno-europop-esque \\"Heaven On Earth\\", like \\"Breathe On Me\\" from Brit's last album \\"In The Zone\\" is another successful attempt by Britney to channel Kylie Minogue. Though I must say this time she didn't do it so hard. There is more Britney on this track than the other one.<br /><br />\\"Break The Ice\\", the second of the album's tracks produced by Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills is a dance floor ready, heavy breathing, perfect blend of crunk'n'b and pop. I was expecting Lil' Jon to jump onto the track any second. \\"Get Naked (I Got A Plan)\\", another hot Hills collaboration that sounds so oddly close to some of veteran producer Timbaland's recent work that it makes me wonder: Who was whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; again? Hills production credits conclude with the dark and sexy dance track \\"Perfect Lover\\" (aka \\"Got Me High\\"), the club anthem and iTunes bonus track \\"Get Back\\" and the boastful \\"Hot As Ice\\" (aka \\"Cold As Fire\\") which contains this lyric:<br /><br />  \\"...They're saying thank you very much (uh huh)<br />  Living legend, you can look but don't touch<br />  Cuz I'm (ooh)<br />  Cold as fire baby, hot as ice.<br />  If you've ever been to Heaven this is (twice as nice)...\\"<br /><br />There goes that \\"legend\\" word again.<br /><br />Bloodshy & Avant also contribute two more dance tracks to the album. The Fergie-esque, \\"Freakshow\\", a repetitive dance number that comes in just under three minutes. The most interesting thing about the song is the male voice that repeats this lyric right after Britney:<br /><br />  \\"Me and my girls like to get it on<br />  Grab us a couple boys to go...\\"<br /><br />Is Britney Spears putting a little homosexuality in an album? I guess it's about damn time, as large as her gay male fan base is. I guess that's why her album was posted in its entirety for previewing at the LGBT cable network LOGO's website as well as MTV. And unlike Beyonce, Britney's acknowledgment of the gay community actually seems genuine. \\"Toy Soldier\\", a song whose premise, much like Destiny's Child's \\"Soldier\\" is about Brit looking for a man who is gonna take care of her as well. The emphasis in this song though is the man who doesn't, the toy soldier.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the album is amazing, not like in an avant-garde, snooty, stuck up, pseudo-intelligent, quote-unqoute \\"artistic\\" sorta way. It's amazing in that if this album doesn't make you dance you don't have a pulse. It's the slickest, most solid, most edgy, most danceable, most genuinely introspective album of her career and will be lighting up dance floors all over the world for years to come, well at least maybe for the next year.I Be Sad\\" (aka \\"Stupid Things\\") which in a roundabout way basically tells the story of the breakup of Britney, the millionaire, from her, not as wealthy, some would even say opportunistic, ex-husband, Kevin Federline contains this lyric:            \\"I sent you out to Vegas          With a pocket full of paper...\\"    Ouch!    \\"Radar\\" (produced by Bloodshy & Avant and contains some of the same sounds as Rihanna's hit \\"SOS\\") and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" (aka \\"Fillin' Me Up\\") are the lighter, more poppy songs of the album, one that's mostly filled with dark, hard hitting dance beats that flirt on the edge of R&B.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Few will want to admit it, and even fewer actually will, but Britney Spears' \\"Blackout\\" is a scintillating, effervescent slice of post-millenium pop that will be a guilty pleasure for many in the coming months. Say what you will about the circumstances of Spears' personal life, which have certainly exceeded the threshold of outlandish, but those circumstances have no effect on her splashy radio and club-ready formula. Troubles or not, her music remains as sweet and caloric as candy corn, appealing to the hyperactive kid in all pop listeners.<br /><br />Of course, Spears is not exactly a \\"force\\" to be reckoned with in the music industry in terms of legendary musical talent - Tony Bennett or Celine Dion she will never be. This is also not music for thinking people, but then with song titles like \\"Hot As Ice\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" that is more than implied. However, these facts alone do not invalidate Spears. The star quality that has endeared her to listeners time and time again is strong as ever on \\"Blackout\\" - one listen and it's hard to imagine these songs being performed by anyone else. Fitting her racy image to a T and never failing to deliver catchy, breathy pop hooks, they are as devilish as they are listenable.<br /><br />On the biographical side of things, \\"Piece of Me\\" is a cheeky smorgasbord of self-referential (or self-aggrandizing, depending on how you look it) anecdotes smothered in chunky electro beats, while the Pharrell Williams-penned \\"Why Should I Be Sad?\\" provides an appropriate closer to a collection of songs otherwise grounded in levity with its bittersweet, resilient attitude set against the by now predictable (though nonetheless enjoyable) production work of the Neptunes.<br /><br />\\"Gimme More,\\" the set's lead single and Spears' highest chart feat on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1999, is one of the less notable tracks here compared to the trippy, atypical wordplay that marks \\"Radar\\" and the downright infectious \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan),\\" a surefire highlight. Hi-NRG beats pulse throughout selections such as the dancefloor-ready \\"Heaven On Earth\\" and \\"Toy Soldier,\\" which has enough kitschy fun for a cult 80's flick.<br /><br />Throughout the collection Spears is the ultimate seductress, oozing genuine sex appeal and passion. By the time she coos \\"you make me feel so hot\\" throughout the lush \\"Perfect Lover,\\" the second to last track, it's impossible to doubt her. May she now be a bona fide pop siren in the same league as Kylie Minogue? Possibly.<br /><br />Jailhouse visits and custody hearings aside, Spears gives listeners reason for hope with \\"Blackout,\\" easily her best and definitely her most intriguing outing to date, even when factoring in her 2004 hits compilation. Oddly enough, she has never sounded more comfortable in her own skin, making this album feel like a debut. Gone are the artistic pretensions that marred her last two albums (she is a performer, not a songwriter), and her material has taken a major upgrade in class. This music is able to self-sustain without the aid of shock value or infamous MTV kissing scene stunts because in and of itself it is purely entertaining.<br /><br />All she needs is for her image to correspond and she will have her life as well as her career back on track.ts pulse throughout selections such as the dancefloor-ready \\"Heaven On Earth\\" and \\"Toy Soldier,\\" which has enough kitschy fun for a cult 80's flick.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Yeah! After being a die hard Brit fan for years, being picked on for the bubble gum sound of the early years, the club mixes later and her public whathaveyou's I was so hoping this album would kick arse! It does! My favorite song is pieces of me, but the whole album it totally danceable. It will be in heavy club rotation. Can't wait for the remixers to get their hands on it. Yeah, it's pop, no there isn't some deep underlying meaning, it is not prophetic or deeply revealing (although people have already started commented on the lyrics of why should I be sad). If you want all of that I would recommend finding religion. Well maybe the idea is to laugh at all the people who were saying her career was over. It is techno heavy and I love how she in synthesizing her voice and riding the beat. Another reviewer mentioned the hyper sexual content, that is true. Great album, thanks for stepping up to the plate fans for your fans Brit!
0743486285|5.0|A must read for any Motley Crue fan.  I'm amazed Nikki is still alive.  Good for him for cleaning up his life, hope it sticks because we don't want to lose him like so many others to drug abuse!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have been a Britney fan for a long time, but after seeing the VMA's I was skeptical about how \\"Blackout\\" would turn out. But, after reading critic reviews about it actually being good, I thought that I would try it out... It is AWESOME!! I absolutely love this record!! She has done it again. It has many club-worthy beats and songs to workout to (which I love!!).     Go buy it Go buy it!! You will not be sorry!!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Most artists who suffer bad publicity can't make a successful career effort, because the bad press gets in the way.      But that's not the case with \\"The Legendary Ms. Britney Spears.\\"  Her album \\"Blackout\\" is without a doubt, the best of her career.  I'll even go so far as to say it's the best of the year!!!    From \\"Gimmie More\\" all the way to \\"Why Should I Be Sad,\\" this album will leave you dancing, having a good time, and forgetting all the crazy press Britney has gotten recently.    Even if you aren't a Britney fan, go buy Blackout now!  You will NOT be sorry!!!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This product arrived in new condition. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I wish I would have gone to see it in the theater. The animation is fantastic. Tom Hanks is also very good playing the various voices he performs. Hot-hot, we got it!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This CD is the most consistent that has come out this year.  Every track is good and at least half of them are slammin.  I have never bought a Britney CD before but after being sucked into several tracks online I realized this is not the Britney that I thought I knew.  The lyrics are real and about what she is going through mixed with some crazy beats.  My favorites are Break the Ice, Ooh Ooh Baby and We can do it.  Every song could be a radio hit.  I found a song online called Let Go which is Britney singing with a piano and slight galloping sound.  Her voice is untouched from the recording booth.  You can hear her turn the page as she sings.  If you doubt that she can sing, I dare you to find it and listen.  She is truly talented whether you like her or not.  I was suprised to hear what kind of range she had. Peace
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I absolutely love this album and I love Britney!! If you are a Britney fan, this album is a MUST BUY! There is only one slow track, Why Should I Be Sad?. Otherwise, this album is filled with very upbeat catchy dance tracks that you will LOVE!My favorite tracks are Gimme More, Piece of Me, Radar, Break The Ice, Heaven on Earth and Toy soldier.You will love each every song! Get it NOW!
0805079831|5.0|In response to the one- and two-star reviews that attack Klein's work as pro-socialist and anti-capitalistic: Klein doesn't directly advocate one economic system over another, and, if anything, she posits that New Deal Keynesian capitalist models might be better all the way around; instead, she looks at the repeated historical implementation of Freidman/Chicago School economic policy the world over and determines that based on the evidence, time and again, it undermines instead of strengthens economies, and creates a climate for a dramatic, ever-widening gap between rich and poor. Is this the fault of Friedman's underlying economic ideal of totally free capitalism? Is it the fault of his theory that great turmoil is required to allow economists and governments to rapidly and radically redistribute economic as well as political power? Perhaps Friedman's theories and ideals are truly altruistic, but the fact of the matter is that, time and again, not only have Chicago School economists employed the chaos of shock theory to advance broad \\"free market capitalism\\" - on populaces that consistently haven't wanted it - but corporations, particularly American interests, have taken advantage of those same conditions of shock and swooped in and seized the affected economies' greatest and most necessary business assets, under the guise of privatisation, before the cultures' most affected by those businesses have time to realize what hit them and what the impacts of those strikes will be. This fundamentally alters the landscape of economic competition, allowing foreign interests to dominate the principal resources of the economy and by raising the cost of goods while slashing wages across the lines of industry, all under little or no taxation, effectively squelches any competition and dissention. Free market economics is not necessarily an \\"evil\\" ideal, but free market fundamentalism advanced undemocratically by moments of shock are too easily perverted by greedy, unscrupulous corporations and government officials who see a civic population not as a culture to be built and cherished but as a \\"market\\" to harness profits from. If Klein is attacking any ideal in this very valuable and prescient analysis of Freidman-era economic and foreign policy, it is not at all the nature of capitalism in the advancement of pro-socialist ideals - it is the truly horrifying and chiefly undemocratic prospect of fundamentalism in economic policy advancement.    If we can all agree that governance by and for the people - governance at the consent of the governed - is the most noble, fair, and good ideal for political governments, why can we not also agree that the people of a given culture/nation have the right to determine for themselves which economic system best serves them?
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold has for the most part, have been given a lot of crap by most people because they don't scream as much anymore and their constant style changes. Even more so because they are \\"mainstream\\" now. I don't think bands that stay with the same musical style amount to anything in the long run. All of Avenged Sevenfold's previous albums have sounded different from each other. This self-titled effort is no different. Those hoping this album is an extension of any of their previous efforts will be seriously disappointed. Those who are comfortable with the music they listen to and are open minded will find a band coming into it's own. You won't find many long solos or a lot of long songs this time around, but you'll get a more focused and varied approach on this Self-Titled effort. Sometimes just doing what you want is the best music of all, as Avenged Sevenfold has done.    Stand out tracks: \\"Afterlife\\", \\"Gunslinger\\", \\"Brompton Cocktail\\", \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\"
B000TEUCFA|5.0|This is Stacey Kent's best work. If you enjoyed her previous recording you'll love this one. I find myself closing my eyes and just letting the wonderful sound wash over me.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|You'll have to ignore anyone who gives the cd 1 or 2 stars, as they obviously have a predisposed obsene hatred for the artist, and are not interested in writing an actual review. Any idiot will tell you this cd is not worthy of less than 3 stars from anyone.    While this cd certainly doesn't represent the type of music I generally listen to, Britney and her huge team of musical producers pulled off something that is actually a bit ahead of the times, which will absolutely work in her favor. Much of the cd has the catchy beat, rhythm, and tempo you'll find on the most popular tracks of the current music scene, but with a unique twist that only Britney's soultry vocals can bring.    The cd is laced with potential money making singles, and I have found only one song I choose not to listen to, a rarity on any cd. I will definitely recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music (albeit, not music that makes you think). I hope Britney brings back some ballads on her next cd... I hope she has a next cd, for that matter.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|first off, i wanna start out by sayin that i used to be a pretty big fan of this girl (or woman). so i am not biased.    altho i didn't buy the album (why would i?), i listened to it enough times to come up w/ a general idea of what this album is really like. this is my conclusion -- it is cheap and extremely superficial to the point where it's hard to stand. my question is, WHY is she still in this industry making trashy music? first, she CANNOT sing (i think no one can say 'objection' to this one). second, she seriously needs to concentrate more on the priorities of her life. i don't think she realizes that she's got children of her own now! why torture people's eardrums? bottom line is that she just can't sing (why lipsych if u can?).     the way she is now just disgusts me -- it's repulsive.  this album -- well... just means that her flagrant name has brought her fame. it has no talent and no meaning. Jive just wants to use her now notorious brand name to make some money...    if ur definition of bad music is something that is very studio synthesized, fake, oversexed, and plain under-educated, DON'T GET THIS CD. it is not worth a penny. as if polluting the radio air waves of today's society is not enough.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I'm very excited to watch this DVD. And cannot wait for it to come out(NOV. 20TH Yall!)
B000002H33|5.0|although this album has merely eight songs, but that doesn't mean it's not one of the best albums in the music industry. the star of this album is \\"master of puppets\\", which is THE song that actually got me into metallica in the first place. it's fast, it's exciting, and oh, don't forget that unforgettable and indispensable guitar solo. another great song is \\"sanitarium\\". it starts out slow, but boy is it a master piece. it reminds me of \\"one\\" somehow. so if you like ...and justice for all's \\"one\\", you'll probably like this particular one too. not to reveal everything, i just want to mention the great instrumental piece at the end of the album -- this is what metallica is known for! i would give this album a gazillion stars if i can
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|simply the best dance album ive heard in ages... what a shocker! Toy Soldier is the most fierce unique song Ive heard in...when? Love it, and I'm not even a Britney fan, but this is a whole new level, and what can I say? I cant stop listening...
0446698326|3.0|I'm a military officer who recently returned from Iraq and thought this book would be a change of pace while giving me some Iraq action to boot.  Even though I would not tell my soldiers I enjoyed the love story, it did nothing for my thirst of Iraq stories.  If you are looking for an easy to read and nice story with a wonderful ending you have come to the right book.  Even though love hurts the right thing finds its home.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|It does not look like other blue ray movies, it dit not look that great as expected, overall the movie is great.
B000E33VWW|3.0|The actors are superb, but the film drags to get to the end. If you are sleepy you will not get to the end.
B000VZC4CQ|5.0|It was Detroit in the early 80's.  The desolation of the Motor City has sometimes been compared to the dreariness of Manchester. Maybe that's why Joy Division, and \\"Closer\\" seemed so familiar.  Those winters in Detroit were marred with potholes, vacant buildings and a Reagan-era economy that left no place for factory workers or their sons and daughters. Namely, it sucked living in Detroit in the early 80's.  There were many bands that we listened to at clubs like Todd's and Bookie's. The Cure, Bauhaus, Sisters of Mercy.  But the one band that cut through all the eyeliner and posing was the one from Manchester that was actually not together anymore.  Not together because their singer had committed suicide.  That was more real to us than was comfortable.  \\"This is the way, step inside\\", Ian sang. And he was dead.  Was he inviting us to join him?  You had to plan to be a survivor if you listened with any regularity to \\"Closer\\".  And today it is looked back upon by the critics and filmmakers and music historians as the masterpiece album it is.  But were they really there at the time when putting on a pair of Koss headphones in your bedroom in your parents' house and listening to Joy Division did not lead to hopeful conversations of the opportunities in life. The music? The greatest Joy. The lyrics? The biggest heartbreak. Like opiates themselves.  We had to be careful. I'm not sure we knew what we were getting into.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This reasonably priced DVD set is a dream for fans of Pink Floyd's brand of space-y and epic rock in general and David Gilmour's immaculate guitar playing in particular.     Disk one captures Gilmour and his prestigious lineup at the Royal Albert Hall and presents nearly the entire concert, culminating with the epic length \\"Echoes\\" from 1971's Meddle album. The audio and video work are superb throughout and perfectly presents the band performing Gilmour's recent solo album On An Island in its entirety, plus a healthy dose of Pink Floyd favorites and enough rarities to satisfy the hard core fans.     Disk two offers a healthy dose of extras including live performances of songs that either didn't make it onto disk one or were recorded at other events. Plus two full length documentaries are included, one going behind the scenes to capture the album being recorded and the other a travelogue of Gilmour and co. on the road presenting their show to audiences around the world.    It all adds up to what is arguably the best Pink Floyd-related DVD since the classic \\"Live at Pompeii\\" film.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I liked this movie more than I thought I would.  I love Samuel L. Jackson and he is very believable in this role, and as a blues musician, well, he rocks!<br /><br />Christina Ricci is also very believable as the tortured nymphomaniac who is so messed up that it's difficult to find sympathy for her at first.<br /><br />If you have ever lived in a small southern town, you'll feel right at home with the characters here.  Black Snake Moan gets the crazy balance between religion and sin that you find everywhere in the Bible belt.  It's pretty much a story of redemption and love set against the racial/economic backdrop of the poor, rural south.  But, it totally doesn't look like it!  LOL--the chains, nudity, violence, and despair get all the attention!<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth watching and talking about, particularly for people who live in this world. And, in many ways, that's all of us.
B000001GX8|5.0|Some music just captures your senses and it was the one track on this CD that I had heard several times as part of a movie. The movie was Shawshank Redemption and one night while watching it, I heard \\"Duettino - Sull Aria\\".I don't know why I hadn't taken notice of it before. I am listening to the entire CD and although I am familiar with the story, the music is still very new to me.     I had difficulty in tracking down an outlet that had the CD I wanted and it was only Amazon that could provide me with it at a reasonable price.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Blackout is Britneys best album to date. Its just so amazing. Every single song is capable of being released as a single. No need to use the skip button for this album, your gonna have to use the repeat button allot though cuz every single track is so hotttt!!! This album is so energetic and electrifying. Say what u want about her personal life but when it comes to her music, you cant say much but that its amazing. This album is sure to be #1!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This film is so bad I couldn't watch all of it so I probably don't have full rights to review but I'll tell you what I thought of the first 50mins.  First off, I find the way the main character speaks quite irritating. Secondly, this film had no plot just dull events and thirdly, it had unnessesary depressing moments like the cow being shot and Napoleon being bullied. I don't know what people like about this and why it has turned into such a cult movie? I like artistic and different movies (I am a huge fan of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Belleville Rendesvous\\") but this.....   If you liked films like Weather Man this is right up your street.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|As a huge Britney fan, I waited a very long time for her to release a new CD, and I have to say that the wait was well worth it. \\"Blackout\\" is just as good as any other record by Britney (even when I do think that there will never be a CD as good as \\"In the Zone\\").     Every single song has a great beat and amazing lyrics, and I couldn't find a single song in the whole cd that I disliked. All of them are simply great! I specially liked the songs \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Radar\\", \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\".     I also noticed, while listening to it, that \\"Blackout\\" is pretty much about 'going back like nothing happened'; Britney is trying to show us with this record that she is the same amazing performer she was a few years ago even with all the scandal that has been going around her lately, and that parenthood doesn't stop her from still being sexy and sing about anything she wants to, just like she says in the song \\"Piece of Me\\": 'I can't see no harm in working and being a mama'     So I'd just like to recommend this CD to everyone so that you all go and buy it, and please don't listen to anyone who says that this is a bad CD, because that's not true, this is some of Britney's best work and anyone who liked her previous cd's will not be disappointed.    And, well, what else can I say?... (as Britney says herself in the first song of the CD): \\"It's Britney, b!tch\\"
B000OLGCI4|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC!!!!  I'm old enough to remember Phil Harris and Louie Prima, and these men were great entertainers that I am sure future generations would enjoy this and other performances by these men.  Phil Harris reminds me of my dad because dad look remarkable similar to Phil.  Dad was sometimes mistaken for this excellent performer.  Just a great movie for the entire family!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|With all the turmoil going on in her life I didn't expect much from her new album. Its very good and would recommended to any Britney Spears fan.  She still has it (at least in her professional life!)
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this cd! It is fun and upbeat. This is great music for dancing or going to the club. I would definitely recommend this cd to anyone who loves music that makes you move!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|THIS NEW CD IS BY FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN ITS PREDOSSESOR,AND THAT WAS A HOT CD TO.  THE CREED CONNECTION IS GONE,AND ALTER BRIDGE NOW ARE A STAND ALONE BAND,THE PLAYING IS AWSOME,THE VOCALS SUBLIME.  NOW IF ONLY THEY WOULD COME TO TOUR IN AUSTRALIA.
B00007AJF8|4.0|At a time when many movies are utter crap, this one stood out for its originality. A hapless puppeteer discovers a 'portal' into the brain of John Malkovich and this device becomes the pivot for weird takes on couplehood, not to mention celebrity.<br />This is a small movie. No one gets shot. No blood. No car crashes. No nudity. In other words, it's a miracle this thing was sort of a minor hit. Great rental movie.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|This is the best movie released in 2007 in terms of suspense and suprises.<br /><br />This movie kept me on edge from the beginning till the end. I kept asking myself \\"What's happening next?\\". I could not guess it. It might also because I have never read the story that this picture was based on. That turned out to be a good thing. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The ending is the biggest surprise. I've never seen any thing like that. The most illogical thing about this script is Nicolas was able to see things only 2 minutes before they happenned. Some people said that's not enough time to act on them in reality. But I can ignore that.<br /><br />I wish the film had explored the relationship between Nicolas and Jessica more. That way, it would have became a suspense and love story.<br /><br />Anyway, it's still one of the best films I've seen so far this year.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Ok, somehow I missed Pink Floyd. I've still never heard \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its entirety. But lately, I've been noticing certain songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" And they are GOOD. This DVD came out of a local library and I was stunned by the visuals. Really trippy. Now I know why people used to say Pink Floyd was a great headphone band. Everybody is really old now in this film, but they can still play great. I'm going back into Pink Floyd to see what else I've missed all these years.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|Bob Dylan's material has always been popularly when interpreted by other artists.  Witness the works of The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Judy Collins among many others.  This collection of Dylan covers is stellar.  In particular, the Calexico collaborations stand out.  \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" featuring Roger McGuinn and Calexico is a real highpoint.  These two artists should sit down in a studio and do a full album together - a match made in heaven!  Also, the Tom Verlaine interpretation of, \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" is brilliant.  I highly recommend this collection to all Dylan fans, as well as fans of the many artists featured.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|A total studio creation. Where's the real talent? I find it hillarious when some people say that this is the album of the year, LOL! It's so funny. I don't hate Britney, she's a human being and she has made many, many, many mistakes, but no one is perfect, but trying to pass her as a real musical artist is simply hillarious! Everything here sounds so computerized, it's so fake. Ask her to sing LIVE in front of a microphone ACCAPELLA and lets see if she can sing. I doubt it very much. This album is what it is, total make-believe!
078322611X|5.0|I have this marvelous movie on VHS and adore it, but know I'm missing alot.  So I've ordered it on DVD which has English sub-titles, and know I'll enjoy it even more.  The story is gripping, touching, and makes one think, \\"Why not??\\"  The \\"dead\\" are all around us, but it was Ray (& wife 'n' daughter) who was blessed to be able to see and communicate with them.  I agree with all the comments from previous reviewers, and in spite of bits of humor here & there, I repeat, bring a hankie for the end.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of some of Diana's greatest works. The group of selections of this CD serve as great examples of Diana's smooth, rich tones and fantastic musical talent. Truly enjoyable!
0316067598|2.0|Because I'm going to say some uncomplimentary things about this book and its author, I want to make something clear:  Marcus Luttrell has literally shed his blood attempting to carry out the missions his commanders gave him, and I admire him for that and appreciate his sacrifices very much.  He's done things I know for a fact I couldn't do.  This book is his account of Operation Redwing, which resulted in the deaths of his three SEAL teammates and of twenty rescuers.<br /><br />However, this book is very nearly unreadable.<br /><br />First, the actual account of Operation Redwing comprises only about a third of the text.  The rest is endlessly repetitive macho boasting.  Luttrell is a rip-roaring, six-gun shooting, God-fearing Texan, as we hear over and over and over and over.  The SEALs are the roughest, toughest, baddest dudes walking the earth, as we hear over and over and over and over.  Do you remember those loud-mouth, over-bearing jocks you went to high school with?  Luttrell is one of them.<br /><br />Second, Luttrell's dramatic you-are-there account of his unit's heoric fight to the death against overwhelming odds is badly-- and sadly-- marred by his complete failure to comprehend why it happened the way it did.  Three interacting factors led to the deaths of Operation Redwing's casualties:  Bad planning and intelligence, bad luck, and arrogance.  Luttrell's four-person SEAL team was plunked down on a barren mountainside that offered no cover and, most importantly, no easy way to escape if anything went wrong.  They were there to watch for and, if possible, capture or kill a Taliban leader.  However, no one seemed aware that he was there with hundreds of his fighters.  While the SEALs were crouched on the mountainside watching, three goat-herders and several dozen bleating goats almost literally stepped right on them.<br /><br />The mission was doomed at that point.  The SEALs could have killed or detained the goat-herders, but their disappearance and the goats milling around on the hillside would have given them away.  They chose to let them go, but then, for some unfathomable reason, they didn't immediately abort their mission and depart the area.  A short while later, they were attacked by hundreds of Taliban fighters and cut to pieces.  Luttrell was the only survivor, mostly because a grenade blew him into a ravine where the Taliban couldn't find him, and he eventually was rescued by some villagers who decided to protect him, even though they put their lives at great risk to do so.<br /><br />Luttrell believes that everyone died not due to bad planning and bad luck, but as a direct result of liberal politicians and media in the US, who won't let the military kill anyone they want.  Luttrell claims that while his team was being shot at, they had a debate about whether the liberals would prosecute them for murder if they shot back.  There's not a chance that really happened.  Nor is there the slightest possibility that the hero of the book, Lt. Michael Murphy (who was recently awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for his actions that day) took a vote about whether to release the goat-herders, and fear of liberals caused the SEALs to let them go.<br /><br />Luttrell directly states that no civilians have the right to even know what the military is doing, let alone the right to control it.  This is a man who clearly doesn't understand the way the American system was designed by the founders.<br /><br />Even worse, he is aggressively and arrogantly ignorant about the places he's sent to, the events that have transpired there, and the people who live there.  I'll bet you didn't know that everyone who hates America in the region-- Saddam, the insurgents in Iraq, the Taliban, al Qaeda, the Iranians, and everyone else-- are all in a conspiracy to destroy us.  I'll bet you also didn't know that there actually are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but-- you guessed it-- the liberals won't let the military go after them.  This kind of claptrap goes on for many, many pages.<br /><br />Finally, the book is riddled with factual errors, some the result of Luttrell's braggadocio, but others more serious.  For example, he tells us that his father was a Texan born and bred, but a few pages later, he was actually born in Oklahoma, then a few pages later, he's an Arkansas woodsman.  No big deal, really, but we also learn that the Pakistani border is in Afghanistan's northwest, that the C-130 that Luttrell flies in is built by Boeing, not Lockheed, that the Taliban derived from the Mujahideen who fought the Russians, and so on.  There are many, many such errors, and one wonders why a respectable publisher like Little, Brown apparently didn't do any fact-checking.<br /><br />So, while I admire Luttrell for his sacrifices, the book he and his co-writer produced is so badly flawed as to be nearly unreadable.  And that is a great shame.nally, the book is riddled with factual errors, some the result of Luttrell's braggadocio, but others more serious.

032147404X|5.0|This is a very helpful book.  The author is a little flip in his presentation sometimes, but he gives some great advise on how to accomplish what you want with your camera.  It is nice because he is very succinct and tells you just what to do to get the desired result and quickly.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|Not many of the tracks stand out. I guess the intro is decent, and Miss Murder is no longer unlisten-able. Kiss And Control is OK too. But I'm still not impressed. Far from it actually.<br /><br />2 stars for the effort, and hopes that AFI sees better days.<br /><br />Melodic in places, and catchy in others, but it's rather lifeless and dull as a whole.
B000002542|4.0|LOTS OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC - GOOD SOLID 70'S RICK! ONE SONG IN PARTICULAR HAS A TAD OF JAZZ MIXED WITH ROCK. OMG - AWESOME. THIS CD IS BEFORE PERRY. YOU WILL LOVE IT.
B000002UC5|4.0|While still with The Beatles, Paul McCartney secretly made the one-man-band, 4-track recorded McCartney album at his home in London, England. He sings, plays all the instruments, and his wife, Linda, sings backing vocals.<br /><br />Mostly acoustic, the songs sound homespun and carefree, and they revolve around Paul's fun and happy new family life. McCartney is not a great album, but it did what it set out to do, and it introduced the public to Paul McCartney, ex-Beatle.<br /><br />The classic Maybe I'm Amazed is the highlight of the album, and the song is still a McCartney concert staple and fan favorite. The acoustic Junk is a pleasantly melodic tune from the precarious perspective of second-hand items for sale at a thrift store.<br /><br />Buy, buy says the sign in the shop window<br />Why, why says the junk in the yard.<br /><br />The song is quite charming, and it's still a part of Paul's repitoire. Every Night is acoustic and also good, and continues the theme of the happy family man.<br /><br />But tonight, I just want to stay in<br />...and be with you.<br /><br />The acoustic Teddy Boy is the story of a single mom, her young son, and their devotion to each other, even as circumstances change their lives. Paul goes electric and plays a hot guitar riff on the lusty Oo You. Man We Was Lonely and That Would Be Something are simple and fun, but that's about it, and the instrumentals on the album are pretty much filler.<br /><br />McCartney fans will find the album special because it was Paul's first, and it has some historical significance because it was the first solo album by an ex-Beatle, and it made it official that, indeed, The Beatles had split.<br /><br />In all, McCartney is an unpolished, homemade, one-man-band family affair that's fun, sort of frivolous, has it's moments, and really isn't that bad, if you relax and take it on it's own terms.
0374280967|5.0|An Uncommon Reader is a tale woven around the current Queen of England discovering the pleasure and passion of reading. Through her adventures discovering good and indifferent literature, the Queen re-examines her life and her beliefs.  This short novel documents the power of reading to subvert even the most staid individual, not through the text itself but through the pursuit of escape and enchantment.<br /><br />Alan Bennett has fashioned a believable book based on the sitting Queen - or at least believable to those of us only seeing her public persona.  The book compliments the Queen, providing her with an ability to step out of character and observe her life.  One hopes that she really has this ability and can chuckle at this book.  It is quite enjoyable.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I just purchased and listened to the new CD set.  Disc #1 was great Eagles music, when I inserted Disc #2 the entire CD was an audio book about Marines.  ??  Not sure if my CD set is a fluke or if this was a mass production error.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|Ok, Critical Acclaim was an awesome song. But what the hell happened after that? Is it ironic that Critical Acclaim is the first song on the CD? It gives you a false feeling for what to expect. This sounds like some lame mix of Coheed and Cambria. There is nothing to be excited about, I can tell you that. They are experimenting way to much and it does NOT sound good. This is not Avenged Sevenfold, this is A7x attempting to carry on with \\"Seize the Day\\" and make it so their tracks land on love movies. Wouldn't recommend.     Oh, and theres a few songs with a WOMAN in it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Right out of the gate this album is on FIRE!  This is cutting edge pop, there is no doubt about it.  If Britney needed something to get back on track, this is IT.  The negative publicity that Britney has received for some time now will have to contend with this monster of an album.  I have a feeling that as long as she stays out of trouble, this strong album will do the talking and be loved by the massive wealth of pop fans on the planet.  Britney, it's time for your comeback!
B0000634EV|5.0|just found this album again haven't listened to it in a while. still a great listen and purchase, the album is fairly long and flows from start to end very well, and some songs are heavier than others so it transists between heavy and quiet nicely. Like the title says this has some nice lasting appeal, in my opinion.<br /><br />personal favorite is \\"Learn from this mistake\\".
1416909532|5.0|This book is so great because it doesn't hold anything back. The author truly sympathizes with women and makes no excuses for their need to make excuses for men. Always a good read!
B000003TA4|5.0|One of the best albums ever made. If you like Nirvana, this is a must have!
B000TUXL2A|4.0|I would classify this as a low-key, moody album.  As such, it didn't dazzle me on first listen, no killer Dire Strait hooks here.  But the 2nd time I listened, I liked it better.  The 3rd, even better.  The 4th... etc.  Each listening reveals nuances I didn't hear before.  Very interesting arrangements, and Knopfler's voice is still wonderful.  Thumbs up.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The narration in perfume is a separate strand. It was added to keep the character of Grunuis free of emotion. As the director himself states, this is an amoral story, there is no blame. I think this is an amazingly well done film. Few films leave your mind pulsing with questions, but this one does. It has subtlety, and though it is superficially a story of a serial murderer the deeper implications are profound. I will say this is not a movie to watch if you like happy stories, filled with happy characters, and happy endings. It contains grisly images and will make you feel highly uncomfortable. It will also provoke deep thought.    If you want to think deeply, you will have a nose for perfume.
0201485672|5.0|I was in a situation where I had to mentor some junior developers overseas on a month long refactoring effort. Having this book as a ready reference point really helped in getting started and organizing my thoughts and approach. Easy to read and well organized, this book is a must-have to hone the craft of creating good code.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This was such a great show, I'm sad that it's ended.  The problem, in my opinion, is that it was marketed all wrong.  To judge by the commercials it looked like a modern day Nancy Drew show about a teenager helping her father solve mysteries.  Instead it's a smart a cynical teenager who's trying to track down her best friends murderer, all the while trying to figure out who raped her, why her mother left, and any number of other problems Nancy Drew never had to deal with.    If they'd marketed this to the right people (ie: not the Gilmore Girls audience) it probably would have done a lot better.  As it is, I'm glad we got a full three seasons, so many shows I love go away after a single season, or less (Firefly got half a season, Mission Hill had one, Freaks and Geeks had one, Sports Night only had two, etc.).  I just wish there had been a few commentaries or \\"making of\\" features included, I'm a sucker for behind the scenes insights (there are some of these on the second season set).
B00005JPFH|3.0|The movie: mediocre at best. They crammed too many half-developed themes into a movie with too many characters doing too many things that mostly don't get resolved (or not resolved well). Individual scenes in the film are good (e.g. the birth of Sandman, the final fight) but these scenes just did not mesh well with the others. Poor editing did not help either. The scene-stealer in this one is Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom. His character is a perfect blend of the Brock characters from Amazing S-Man and Ultimate S-Man and Grace plays it with style. I would recommend the movie to die-hard fans and people who just want to watch a movie with a lot of interesting CG fight scenes. If you are looking for another Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2, you won't find it here.<br /><br />The DVD: Tons of little featurettes dominate this 2-disc set. Each one spends a lot of time discussing the details of the CG and special effects processes which proves just how reliant the filmakers were on gimmicks instead of a coherent script. The 3 main featurettes focus on each villain. The interviews with the actors are good because you can see that they enjoy the characters they play. There is a trailer gallery that includes tv spots from different countries, an interesting addition (especially the German Venom-fest). There are two commentaries: 1)the producers/filmakers talk mostly about technical aspects of the film and pat each other on the back; 2)Sam Raimi and the main cast discuss there roles in the film. This latter commentary is entertaining since the cast has great chemistry together and crack plenty of jokes. The most glaring flaw in this (as with other S-Man DVDs) is the lack of deleted/alternate scenes. This is a shame because there were plenty of great scenes removed from the theatrical cut (read the novelization or scope the internet for details).<br />I would recommend the 2-disc set for die-hard Spider-Fans only. Otherwise, save $10 and buy the 1-disc version.
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|I should have heeded the advice of your other reviewers. This CD didn't seem to represent the soundtrack at all. The music in the movie was much better. Very disappointing
0143038583|4.0|Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma is a fascinating if not challenging book dealing with numerous subjects revolved around the history of food and where are nourishment comes from.  The book is at its best when it goes behind the scenes; whether it's the economics and processes into the corn industry, or the detailed symbiotic logistics of the Polyface farm, Pollan's cross of investigative environmental social journalism connects on the specifics while making the relevant \\"big picture\\" connections.    The book is divided up into three major parts.  The first is an investigation into the corn industry and a look at how corn is prevalent in almost everything we eat while also looking at how oil plays a major role in our food production and distribution. Pollan goes on site to do his research and gets many interesting first hand accounts and perspectives on the evolution of corn.  I guarantee you won't look at corn or the food industry the same way, as what we eat is now an environmental statement more than anything else.    The second part is an eye-opening look at the organic industry and the amazing Polyface farm in Virginia.  The day-to-day operations of Polyface are an amazing example of holistic farming and what can be done with ingenuity and intelligence, two things lacking in the agriculture industry because of the \\"college talent sink\\" of the last 50 years.  I found the farm intriguing and inspiring at the same time and most importantly, after reflecting about Pollan's week long stay there, I would consider paying a premium for their food which is what is holding back others from copying Polyface's techniques.    The third section follows Pollan as he plays the hunter-gatherer and makes his own meal without buying any of the major components.  He grows his own produce, but more importantly, learns how to gather mushrooms and hunts his own wild boar.  Honestly I found this section pedestrian and too focused on the author himself instead of the subject matter.    Pollan's writing style is informative and often humorously anecdotal although a friend of mine found him condescending in tone.  I can't say I agree although the book is not intended for novice readers because of its length and higher-level reasoning.  Readers need to actively engage with this book to truly \\"get it\\".    Bottom Line:  A must read (at lest the first two sections) for the environmental and culinary conscious individual.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|What can i say about britney..... i only can say that THE PRINCESS IS BACK!!!!!!!!! Good quality of sound, the sexiest voice,in one word, the best cd of the year!!!!!!
B000W1V44I|5.0|To be honest I wasn't expecting much from The Boys, especially since they have lost a supposedly \\"key\\" member of their group. But I was pleasantly surprised. My musically talented wife and I have been partial to the BSB for a while now, and after two full listens we believe this CD shows off their vocal abilities in a package that is once again accessible to a mainstream audience. Yes there are some \\"old school\\" BSB offerings (for any fans out there, you know about those dramatic pauses followed by a crescendo), two or three songs have a little bit of a redundant sound, but the rest of the CD progresses and matures to the point where I found myself saying \\"why did they choose Inconsolable as their first song to release to radio/MTV/etc.?\\" 90% of the songs on the CD are better than that one.    An entertaining, accessible, and musically/vocally rich album from the evolved and durable boy band. Good male vocals from upstanding citizens are a rarity these days, and that that is worth the purchase in itself.
B000VZBCWE|4.0|This IS the Same as the previously released We Will Rock You LIVE FROM MONTREAL DVD, and that too had DTS Sound.  On My combo JBL & Infinity speakers it sounded GREAT, and I'm sure this \\"enhanced\\" (?) New DTS Mix will sound just as fine.  One thing the prior version had was the inclusion of a Commentary track by the Director/Producer of the concert film, Saul Swimmer, which was Very insightful about the band at the time, that particular tour, their approach to touring and shows, how The Band wanted this Concert Film to be Different from others, etc.  Also, it had a lot of other \\"inside\\" information that I found very cool to hear and find out.  So to have this \\"new/enhanced\\" DTS version WITH the LIVE AID footage is cool with the added rehearsals thrown in.  I Was AT Live Aid in Philly, on the field about 100' from the stage Purposely so we could watch QUEEN from Wembley--a great & VERY HOT day indeed!!  So in my opinion, if this really does have Enhanced picture and Improved DTS sound, with the new commentary tracks by Brian/Roger, it will be very worth it.  And with my new 2-month old 50\\" Samsung DLP, Onkyo 7.1 Receiver, and Polk Audio speaker system, I can't wait to ROCK the House LOUD!!!  I only was able to see the band One time, 9/26/80, the Day After John Bonham of Led Zep died, and the show was at the Old famed Boston Garden (the Original one, not the newer one obv).  It was a great show, and they used the same Widely praised \\"Moving\\" Lighting rigs which were very innovative at the time.  At the end, Freddie dedicated \\"We Are The Champions\\" to their \\"dear friend, John Bonham\\", which brought the place down almost.  That was for the JAZZ tour at the time.
B00003CXIP|4.0|Many times in my life I've felt on the verge of an adventure.  Many times I haven't followed through, but when I have the world has opened up to a new understanding.  That's what I think about when I think of this movie.  A coming of age tale of stretching the view of the world and the lessons that are part of a growing understanding.  Any person that has tried to stretch their wings and move out into an unknown opportunity or future can identify with the feelings such a choice encompasses.  The moving story combined with a beautiful song are a hard combination to top.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I knew this was a good movie...just a little dissappointed that it didn't come with the pictured stuffed animals.
B000V4UFZK|3.0|This movie scared like me no other movie I've watch which a guess is the point, but when you watch it in the theaters as a child sitting in a booster seat the scare sticks with you in a way it may not reach an adult.  I only remember bits and pieces of the first time because I think I was cowaring in my seat and trying not to watch it.  I wanted to give it one star, but think it is well made so at least deserves three.  I don't recommend this movie for any child and have no plans to re-watch it in my lifetime.
0738702994|5.0|This is definantly the best tarot deck I own, and I have several.  Its based off the Rider-Waite, so its easier if you are used to that deck.  The images are what get me.  Each card has a unique, extremely beautiful watercolor that is based off Welsh mythology.  This set also includes a small reading book, and since I don't have meanings memorized I was thankful for that
0743496728|3.0|The storyline had so much potential and the concept made me think about stereotypical potential school shooters and how many of \\"those kids\\" I remember from back in the day.  Reading about the parents/especially the mothers' perspectives on their children and the baby memories and unconditional love was heartwrenching. The book lost me, however, going back and forth between the past and present too much...and the underlying 'twist' wasn't at all what it could have been..the build up was not worth the final outcome.  Overall \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" was not really a page-turner (I could put it down for days at a time), but not bad.
B000WSHF4E|4.0|A holy war has been declared against England's Protestant Queen Elizabeth (Blanchett) by the Pope.  Leading the charge is Spain's King Philip II, who wants to replace her with Quenn Mary of Scotland (Morton), a Catholic who is imprisoned.  On the home front, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).  She rejects many possible husbands, but finds some interest in Sir Walter Raleigh (Owen).    \\"The Golden Age\\" is an entertaining but flawed movie.  On the positive side, it is great to look at.  The costumes, set design, and cinematography are gorgeous.  The acting, while not as standout as in the first movie, is still impressive, especially by Cate Blanchett.  On the negative side of things, the story isn't that exciting.  Historical fact is also compromised for cinematic value, but not much is added.  The war with Spain comes and goes quickly, and without much excitement.  \\"The Golden Age\\" is an adequate sequel, but by no means surpasses the original.  It is worth checking out though.
B000127LW2|5.0|Genevieve Bujold was originally cast to play Captain Janeway, but a few days into filming the first episode, she abruptly quit. And thank goodness she did because we got Kate Mulgrew (even though Gary Graham and Nigel Havers were also considered for the Captain's chair.)<br /><br />This series held so much promise in the first season - a new quadrant to explore, new species, a female Captain, etc.  But during the series run the show and the Captain suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia - never knowing exactly what they were supposed to be. And that I blame on the producers and writers. Every show needs a Prime Directive so to speak, and Voyager never found its core theme.<br /><br />I still love this series and now that the price has come down on the boxed sets, will start adding it to my TV dvd collection.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. Strange plot, a dweebie tax guy is the focus of a novel, and can hear the narrator describing his life. Starts out slow, but as he meets this entertaining baker that he's auditing, things get interesting. She wrote some crazy letter to the IRS explaining why she would only pay a percent of what she owed. So, of course, she got audited, and opened up his eyes to the life going on around him.<br /><br />His interactions with Dustin Hoffman, a college lit professor, who sort of becomes his shrink, is interesting. Hoffman is trying to find out where the novel is going, tragedy or comedy? There are some holes and weaknesses, which is why I didn't give it a five star review. But five star movies really are few and far between. I enjoyed it, and recommend it to my friends.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Has anyone else ever wished that Michael would do an album with Harry Connick where Harry arranged and conducted all the band and string music and Michael did all the vocals?      The band work on this album is good, but not of the caliber Connick can write. On the other hand, Michael's voice is much more pleasureable to listen to than Harry's.    Guys, let's see some collaboration on a CD!    And this is an album worth having.    Paul
B000V8I2QU|5.0|A truly satisfying album if you're a Springsteen fan. If you're not, it will grow on you.  This is the album that Springsteen fans have been waiting for and has been so long overdue in his familiar rock n' roll style.  Songs that stand out for me are \\"Livin' In the Future\\", \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\", \\"Gypsy Biker\\", \\"Last To Die\\", \\"You'll Be \\"Comin' Down\\", \\"Long Walk Home\\" and \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\".  This compilation will stand the test of time, will be great to see him do live in years to come and fit comfortably side by side with his classics.  Thank you Mr. Springsteen!
B000059PPN|2.0|It's hard to imagine this is the same person behind \\"The Beyond\\" and \\"Zombi.\\" Heck, even \\"The Psychic\\" (pretty rare film to dig up) was better than this garbage. This is one of the more boring Italian horror films I have in my collection. The gore was laughable and not even in a goofy/good kind of way, just atrociously stupid. The young boy, I hope, was banned from the screen actor's guild, and the voice actor who dubbed his parts should have been exiled from all of civilization. Wow. If you'd like to watch a series of unrelated random events with a bit of unexplainable gore, 1 hour of nothing, and a pointless ending with one of the more ham-handed performances by an evil, undead villain, by all means knock yourselves out. The only good thing I will say about this film is that the atmosphere is very Italian gothic, and was effective (reason why I give it 2 stars). Anyway, Fulci should have stuck with his mystery movies and neanderthal gory themes, which he's very good at in moderation. The minute he tried to rip off aspects of the Shining and the Changeling, he lost the tiny bit credibility he may have still had. Avoid this gutter snipe, and move on to his better films such as those I mentioned above.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is my favorite Springsteen album in quite a while, probably since Nebraska.  The style is more like Born in the USA, though, with the E Street Band in force once again.  Terrific stuff and real return to form.  I loved the Woody Guthrie record, too, but it wasn't a real Springsteen record.  This one is.  If you like old school Bruce, you'll love it.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Shane Black's directorial debut has a lot going for it: a good cast, fast paced action, witty dialogue. Unfortunately it also has an overly complicated plot line that has a tendancy to confuse more than it reveals.    Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a small time crook who escapes a botched robbery into an audition for a detective film. Whisked off to Hollywood he is paired with a gay PI, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) hired to get him ready for his casting call.  While in Hollywood he meets  an old flame Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) who gets him embroiled in a pulpish noir mystery.    The film throws every cliche at its viewer that it can muster and the overly contrived plot gets somewhat tiresome but there is great dialogue here written by the man who created Lethal Weapon. The acting is good and the chemistry between Downey and Monaghan feels genuine.    The disc presents a near perfect transfer but is a little lacking in extras. A four minute gag real and a commentary track with Black, Kilmer, and Downey are featured. This could have been a great film with a little work on the plot. As it stands it's a merely good film.    Worth a rental for a few laughs.

B000GPIPD8|5.0|These guys know how to rock; they are as loose and as fuzzy as Hendrix was in his early days (without the screeching guitar obviously). If you like classic rock, you'll like these guys. Their other albums are equally as good.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I am just as surprised as anyone that this album is as good as it turned out. A part of me wants to say it is because I had low epectations (I had)and then another part of me that is cheering Brit on. It is sad that our soceity can rip another human being apart for just being ... human! I hope that she can turn things around on a personal level. Critics can say it is good for being a corporate produced album. I just hear and like it. I like it!! It is good.
B0002FR07O|5.0|Just saw the tree here in Atlanta (10/29/07) last night at the Roxy Theater. What a band, polished and professional! These guys should be playing Stadiums instead of 1000 seat halls. As a musician I really appreciate bands that blend musical complexity with highly listenable tunes. This album is really well done. I suggest listening to the following tracks 1. The Sleep of No Dreaming 2. Waiting Phase One 3. Dark Matter. This is a great album. Also give the albums In Absentia,Darkwing and Fear of a Blank Planet a listen (All Excellent!) Happy listening.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is generally not the typical genre of music I follow but after the 2006 Grammy award I was encouraged to listen to Mayer, Blunt, Bailey-Rae and so begins another chapter of listening to Pop/Rock inspired music.  And John Mayer is incredible as a vocalist whose lyrics really transcend the needs of the people.  His songs have intelect, integrity, humanity and compassion.  These are the qualities you look for in a leader.  I am sure he is probably not interested but I think he has all of the qualities of the type of politician we need. And he makes that damn quitar sing.  I am particularly impressed with his vocal ability, sound quality and clarity.  I had to backtrack  to his 200*? release, Room For Squares, and it just got better.  He is quite the Rocker.
B000Y179KO|4.0|The 2 CD set contains some great Eagles harmonies and melodies. The music doesn't stray far from what we have come to love about this band. A few of the songs made me smile. I like a little political nod now & then. The opener \\"No More Walks...\\" harkens back to the \\"Seven Bridges from their live set. Very Worth buying. Not a clunker in the bunch.

B000E6ESL2|4.0|SPOILER WARNING!!  This film is artistically deft and well-crafted.  The performances are solid considering how abstract the characters really are after you are through the looking glass of a film that this is.  This isn't a \\"Sixth Sense\\", it something different, a trippy mind-bender that isn't looking to give you a great \\"twist\\", but looking to provide you with the answers you are looking for.  It's a sad film, but in the end, a sensible and logical one.  It's not as bizarre as some may make it out to be.  The end justifies everything that came before it.  Will you like it?  It may be hard for some people to like this film.  I love it for the imagery and the concept behind everything you hear and see in the film.  It's a very serious film about a serious subject.  It is a surreal look at probably the single most important thing that will ever happen to any of us, the one of two things we all have in common and the thing we can't escape.  And to tell you the truth, this film scared me in that regard.  I feel like this film is an honest representation of how it would happen.  And I am trying to be as vague as possible here to give you some suspense while watching it, but truthfully, you don't need to be held in suspense.  I actually enjoyed it more in the second viewing.  Looking out for things here and there.  The movie merits a rental viewing on it's artistic use of cinematography and visual effects alone.  But it's not for the faint of heart.
B000067FP8|1.0|I'm not sure why anyone would find this film better than watching the grass grow.  It certainly is not better than the first Gremlins film, which was charming, funny, and frankly, a story.  Gremiln's 2 relies on cheap call backs from its predecessor, slap-dash antics and the weakest excuse of a story.  It just doesn't add up to much.  Don't bother with this one, especially if you loved Gremlins 1.  Gremlins 2 is a waste of both time and money. Maybe rent it with one hand--and hold your nose with the other.  Gremlins 2--you've been warned!

B0002CHIJW|3.0|Okay. This film is undoubtably the most disturbing film I've ever seen and arguably the most harcore sexploitation piece of the 1970's. The rape scenes are so brutal and violent that they actually induce pain in the viewer.      The most interesting aspect of this movie is the viewer's motivation for viewing. It's one of two:  1) The viewer has somewhat perverse and violent sexual tendencies and only watches the movie to \\"get off\\", using it like a tool, a porno. This person does not care about the heroine's acting or gender implications.  2) The viewer is interested in astetics and a wide range of cinema genres and sub-genres, for that matter. This person observes the acting, cinematography, symbolism, gender implications, and is so knowledgeable about movies that he/she is familiar with 1970's cinematic underground including exploitation, sexploitation, blacksploitation, grindhouse, and slasher features.    So, the question is... are you a sexual deviant or an educated movie-goer?

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Oh, Britney! How did you do this? How in the Federline did you make the best dance record of the year?! You shouldn't have. There shouldn't be songs piled on songs of just pure pop perfection.     There is not one weak track on this CD. From the bleeps and layered chorus of \\"Radar,\\" which takes Rihanna's own \\"Umbrella\\" and beats her it with it, all the way to the thumping \\"Get Naked,\\" with its command to do exactly what the song says. You can't help but move to this record. This album is all hand claps, sing along choruses, thudding beats and snappy bridges.    Spears uses her proven hit makers, working with the producers who gave her, \\"Toxic\\" and \\"I'm a Slave For You\\" and it works and works very well. \\"Piece of Me\\" with it's thudding beat and Britney's voice in full robotic studio mode will have you dancing somehow as she talks about her trials and life. \\"Heaven on Earth\\" sounds like she went back in time and stalked Madonna in the 80's! Just a slice of pure pop.     This IS a club/dance record. It's the best \\"cooing\\" and \\"aahhhing\\" Britney has ever done. It's as if she's fully aware of what she is to pop music now. She's the Cher, the  Madonna, the Janet. She's all out for fun on her records, and if you note all three of those women have had their on trials and media issues in real life as well.     By the time \\"Why Should I be Sad\\" comes on, it's almost a reality check. It doesn't slow down the album, but the lyrics (penned by Pharrell of the Neptunes) couldn't give you more unclear notions about everything you just heard. When she says \\"I'm tired of singing sad songs ...\\" Every single song can be seen in a different light. This album can be viewed as her escapism from every single thing around her. And when Pharell says, \\"Britney, Let's Go.\\" you wonder if she really wants to leave the mess of being Britney Spears behind her.     *Get your hands on the bonus tracks. \\"Everybody,\\" with its Eurythmics sample and Britney doing her best \\"Britney\\" growl makes you wonder why it wasn't an album track. And \\"Get Back\\" is the other gem. It's all drum, hook and Britney clawing and speeding above the zipping beat.

B000KV5KCM|4.0|[This review is based on the novel as it is published in the Library of America edition, containing 3 other novels by Dick.]    Ubik is a fascinating novel. If you're into virtual realities - Matrix-like - and such, then you would appreciate Ubik. The novel begins like any other Dick novel I read: it's full of obscure terms such as \\"precog\\" and other cryptical things, which are meant to be, and which you will soon enough understand clearly. That's not unusual of sci-fi novels.    So what you have in this novel is a world in which psychic people are used to spy on people, and to counter this, anti-psychic people are used to neutralise the threat. That's the background, but it's far from being very telling about the novel. In this futuristic world, when people die, they're not entirely dead. Indeed, they are kept alive, or half-alive, via cold-pacs. These are the two elements that structure the story.    Then the real plot gets started, and I won't tell you much about it because it is reality-destroying, mind-tearing, and everything. I'll only tell you that at some point, reality regresses. Cars turn into older cars, elevators devolve, milk goes stale, cigarettes become dry and break under the touch, etc. Time is turning back!     And then there is even more interesting material. The novel gets better and better, and even the ending is excellent, which is not something I often found with Dick.     Of the four novels I read from this author, Ubik stands out as having that superior crafting, or something, and it makes a difference. Little things like the fact that every chapter begins with a quote that's in fact a piece of advertising for Ubik, the product, added some goodness to the novel. And yes, you will come to know what Ubik really is. All you have to do is keep reading.
1400063515|3.0|Taleb offers interesting ideas but couches them in disjoint prose.  This is more a collection of barely related essays instead of a cohesive whole.  It's like he had too much to cover and not enough time to tie it together properly.      There were also numerous editing errors that should have been caught.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I simply love this album.  I've been a Travis fan for a while and though my musical taste changes from day to day, this is an album I have never gotten tired of.  I enjoy it start to finish every time I put it on.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Five years ago, who would have thought that la Spears would turn out to be the mess that she is today?  With her freakish antics with K-Fed, her children, her hair and the press, this frequent and habitual user of drugs needed one helluva album to redeem her career.  She doesn't pull through, unfortunately.  The final result is a mess of an album (\\"Blackout,\\" how appropriate is that???) with no continuity or originality whatsoever.  She's become the Michael Jackson of her generation--a bright and shining star that fizzled out much too soon.
1594481717|5.0|Excellent book.  Being an Art teacher, I, as well as  others in my profession,  am costantly challenged by \\"Academics\\".  After all - can Art really be as important as Science and English? Isn't Art just a \\"fun\\" class?  Well, this book and the insights of professionals interviewed by Mr. Pink, proves that Art is in fact a vital part of education, and even more so, a vital and necessary part of our future if we as a nation wish to prosper!  This book should be read by every admnistratior in the educational system.

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|To be quick and to the point I'll say this: this is an album for only three kinds of people. Britney fans (and fanatics), people who will dance to anything with a heavy thudding electronic beat, and people who don't mind when studio production far, far, far outshines the artist.<br />If you're one of those three kinds of people then Britney's Blackout will be right up your alley. However, if you're simply curious about what kind of artistic creativity was born of such a sad fiasco of a personal life, then I suggest you listen to the whole album online for free while you still can.<br /><br />I was one of the curious ones who listened to Blackout online, and while I will admit that there is plenty of catchy fluff on the album it's difficult for me to overlook the fact that the high points of it are owed almost entirely to the producers rather than Britney herself. The fact is, and we've all heard it before, that Britney has very limited vocal range. Every single track on Blackout is so overproduced that Britney's voice is hardly recongnizable, and when it is you're quickly reminded of why it needed to be tweaked in the first place.<br /><br />Things start off well with the lead single Gimme More, but it goes downhill from there. Pieces of Me brings one word to mind: noisy. Very electronic, but not very listenable. Then there's Radar which isn't quite as bad, but it feels so bland about a minute into listening that I found myself wanting to skip again. Break the Ice has Britney's voice sounding pretty good for her and it sounds like the kind of generic song that could be a hit on the radio, but it doesn't do too much for me personally. Heaven on Earth sounds a lot like a Paris Hilton song and almost seems too sugary for this sexpot of an album. Get Naked is probably the best song on the album. The male voice that loops throughout the song can be irritating, but for once Britney herself actually makes the song more enjoyable. It's nicely arranged and should definitely be a single, though it's not the most memorable track ever. Freakshow has a very minimalistic sound and is one of the most dull songs on the album. There were tracks that leaked months ago that would have replaced this song very well. Toy Soldier, however, is a fun song. It's definitely one of the more creative tracks and has a unique sound that is mostly missing on this ultra-electronic album. Hot as Ice is a catchy, upbeat song, but I liked the demos of it better. In any case at times it's rendered almost unlistenable by Britney's pitchy, girlish vocals. Perfect Lover isn't necessarily a bad song, but it's another one that I find myself skipping due to it's rather generic production. I'm not quite sure what to think of the subdued Why Should I Be Sad. Suffice it to say I was happy that it was the final track on the album.<br /><br />Overall this is an album with a major weak point that you may find very bothersome: Britney's voice. Even if it's never bothered you before, on Blackout it just might.gh it's not the most memorable track ever. Freakshow has a very minimalistic sound and is one of the most dull songs on the album.

B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I love How I Met Your Mother. It is one of my favorite shows and it great to have the complete season two! I missed a few episodes last season and it's great to be able to catch up on the ones i missed plus the bonuis features are great too! If you like How I Met Your Mother or know someone who does this is great!
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I was really sad to see this show get cancelled, and sadder still to see a couple of its' main characters get killed off in the movie.  But it's a nice collection of extras, and a fine finish to a well made, short-lived series.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's really more about the \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" album as an entire production than any of the songs in my opinion.  How they managed to put it all together is still mystifying even with the latest recording technology.  I mean with a 4-track?  C'mon!  Paul's songs are better and I don't usually say that, but he is truly faultless on this album and he did a lion's share of the writing.  Lennon has fewer contributions, one of which, \\"Good Morning...\\", is one of his worst in the post-Beatlemania era, but the rest are pure gold nuggets.  \\"A Day in the Life\\" and \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" were Lennon and McCartney collaborations, which were becoming more and more of a rarity at this stage.  \\"Getting Better\\" is a great rock song and \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" are on par with some of Paul's best compositions with the Beatles.  \\"Lovely Rita\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\", \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", all of his stuff on this album is fantastic.  George's one song, \\"Within You Without You\\", is interesting as a departure but doesn't rank with some of his later work (I thought his best foray into Indian music was \\"The Inner Light\\", but I'm glad it didn't extend far beyond that).  Otherwise, this album is one of the great-classic-music-listening experiences and it should be considered in it's entirety.  The whole is greater than the sum in this case.  Also, the music shines regardless of it's cultural significance and it's better than \\"Pet Sounds\\", which I've heard was the high-water mark that they were aiming for.    Best Beatles?  The best was last their last.  With \\"Abbey Road\\" they created an even greater grandeur without all of the tricks of \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" while rocking harder and better than any of their contemporaries.  But yeah, \\"Revolver\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"THE Beatles\\", and others not normally mentioned were all exceptional for their own reasons.  None of their albums are perfect but it's The Beatles for crying out loud!
0143038419|5.0|The author's personal journey is written in a funny, light hearted manner.  It is highly readable and fully enjoyable.  I could relate to her personal disclosures throughout the book... from learning to be honest with oneself to being quiet and introspective (after existing as a gregacious social woman), her journey spiritually is nothing but inspiring.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|First of all I have to say that Britney's personal life and her music are 2 totally seperate things and I think people need to deal with that and stop judging her music harshly due to what is said in tabloids.<br />That being said Britney's latest effort `Blackout' is her best CD to date and I would even have to go as far as to say that it is the best to come out this year. This CD evokes nothing but fun and happiness. From start to finish it is one great song after another. From the production, lyrics and her voice, this CD simply soars. Pretty much every song on this set screams single!! Every one of them is so radio friendly not to mention catchy, very dance friendly and upbeat. I have liked all of Brit's previous releases but there were always songs on each CD that I would skip over. Not on `Blackout' - every song is better than the last. No skipping going on here. Every song on here is a standout and a must hear but a few of my favorites that I tend to hit repeat on are:<br /><br />\\"Gimme More\\" - everyone knows this song and it has spawned the biggest catchphrase of the year.<br /><br />\\"Piece Of Me\\" - a great electro/pop song with amazing lyrics that seem to detail her life in the media. It is said to be her next single as well.<br /><br />\\"Heaven On Earth\\" - a fun dance song that sounds like it could have come straight off of Madonna's 2005 CD: `Confessions On A Dance Floor' or something that sounds like it was made for Kylie Minogue but no one does it better than Britney here.<br /><br />\\"Break The Ice\\" - One of the catchiest songs on here with a great beat and an even better hook and chorus.<br /><br />\\"Oooh Oooh Baby\\" - this song has a great anathematic sound to it with a stellar beat.<br /><br />I could go on and on about every song. All I need to say is that this CD is a must have and I could not have asked for anything better from Ms. Spears. A sure fire hit and a CD everyone will be talking about - not because of her personal life but due to the fact that it is great music!!!
B00005JPFF|5.0|Being that I have been and still am a HUGE Spider-Man fan and AM NOT one to assume \\"flaws\\" and \\"imperfections\\" take down a movie...I mean, come on...who actually watched the previews for this movie REMEMBERING that is WOULD HAVE 3 villians...AND THEN went to see it? It's a movie, guys, come on. I mean, look, being such a fan of the book I was kinda dissapointed at the way they changed the black suit, but you know what? I got over it. If you really are \\"so dissapointed\\" then don't watch it and stop ruining it for all those who anticipate a good movie. If you want to make analogies, then you really just need to stop. I'll say this to make my point and be done with all of you who feel the need to pointlessly add this negative take on what you people call a \\"movie review,\\": there is nothing new under the sun. While twisting the perspective and adding innovation makes things appear different...the basic premise and point of ANY MOVIE and ANY SHOW has been done...just sit back and ENJOY the movie. You wanna be an analyst, then go look for the cure to a disease. Movies are made for people to watch, RELAX, and ENJOY. For those who want something to kick-back and enjoy...watch this movie...those who wanna nit-pick and point out flaws...you can watch it too. Either way: still a damn good movie REGARDLESS of what it \\"was missing,\\" or \\"didn't have enough of.\\"
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Britney is someone whose career has been largely based on image.  Don't pretend when you think of hit me baby, you aren't thinking of her in the catholic school girl outfit, or Me against the music thinking of the Madonna kiss.  This of course becomes problimatic when your image is divorce, losing your children, drug addiction, car crashing (do I need to continue?).  As such, most will listen to this album and love it, given that it is not reflective of her sporadic life, but instead a fairly coherent album.  This is unfortunate in that the album will get far better reviews than it deserves, in fact some will state this shows her true side and is a comeback.  Neither are true, as she didn't write most of this album, but hired top producers to do it for her, and since she really hasn't fallen in sales or disappeared, its not a come back.  This album, much like In the Zone, is nothing more than a few great singles, and some listenable music.  If you like Britney you'll be happy.  If not, nothing will convert you.  But before you buy it, realize there will be no revelations into her current media issues, or anything close to acknowledging them, just some catchy club beats, some swearing, and a few catchy tunes.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|A7X has had a distinct and unmissable style from the moment they came out in 2002 or something like that.  They are all such amazing musicians and the fact that they were named Best Band of 2006 by MTV (they came out in 2002 you ****ing tools) has not hindered their style at all.  Many people like to be cool and bash them since they're so popular with the mainstream, but its for that very reason that I don't watch TV or listen to the radio.  I was worried about this album and its validity as a real Avenged Sevenfold album when I heard the single Critical Acclaim (MEH to that song, its just not them trying.  Fortunately the rest of the album is nothing comparable to this).  No, they're not as hard as they used to be, a blown vocal chord will do that to a singer, but their music has not toned down at all and unless you are deaf the pure ROCK of this album is apparent.  To haters, I ask simply, how do your intestines look?  Pull your heads out of your arses and realize that just because a band is on MTV does not mean they have \\"sold out\\" (what does that term even mean, honestly), and listen un-biased to these guys as they rock out for yet another awesome album.  Their style has changed considerably, its called  artistic growth, and it is undeniably another classic from a truly great band.  If you heard this band on MTV, its not too late for you.  Buy Waking the Fallen and 7th Trumpet, you may yet be saved    But what is my opinon worth anyway, I'm simply someone un-cool enough to listen to the music instead of the reviews and popular anti-MTV opinion (or pro-MTV).

0375714839|5.0|i am not someone who typically enjoys 'cartoon' strips, but i could not put this book down and read it fervently.  i received this book as a gift after having visited iran a couple of times, and i was interested in learning more about the history and culture.  what marjiane captures of her childhood, and her evolution into adulthood, is thoughtful, amusing, heart-breaking and at times hilarious.  at times she softens the brutality of her words with the humor of amusing caricatures, or sometimes the simplicity of what she sees as a child is made more stark and tragic by her drawings.  her personal journey and her family's experiences during and after the revolution really give one pause.  i would highly recommend this book, it is rich with humor and emotion.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|While most older rockers release mediocre albums that get praise from hardcore listeners, Bruce keeps releasing great work.  Radio nowhere is as fun and catchy as anything he's released, the rest of the album shows a writer enjoying music, as well as working to make listeners and fans like it as well.  A great listen, and easily up to his best work.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney has reinvented herself with her new album \\"Blackout\\". The style and the tone of the album are totally different from her other albums, which makes Blackout - unique and interesting.  Unlike the previous album, \\"In The Zone\\" (very promiscuous in styles), Britney's new album is mainly focused on style of music - dance music. And how great it turned out. The music is so professional and atchy, it is obvious that Britney is a huge worlwide pop star, not a beginner.      1. Gimme More - very hot song, a huge hit that we all heard. Perfectly sets the tone for all the album. Vocal is hot. Everyone loves the song.  2. Piece Of Me - song, that proves that this album is a new style for Britney. totally different and definitely hot, a little bit inspired by Fergie style.  3. Radar - fun and hot, really catchy song. Could be a good single.  4. Break The Ice - one of my favourite tracks. I've heard it before the album came out and it became my favourite. It's perfect. Her gentle vocal is the best on album (starts from 0:35 of the song), I love that tone of her voice.  5. Heaven On Earth - very much like And Then We Kiss from \\"B In The Mix\\" - has a techno European style, brutal but hot.  6. Get Naked (I Got A Plan) - very much like Nelly Furtado or Justin Timberlake style, very much like Timbaland. It's freaking HOT. Much better than other artists' songs. Sexy.  7. Freakshow - very fun and hot song. Kind of like Brave New Girl from \\"In The Zone\\" but hip-pop centred.  8. Toy Soldier - very hot, her voice is different. The song is outgoing and fun, video would be perfect if she walks down the street and dances.  9. Hot As Ice - third and the last song that I have heard before the album. And again - one of my favourites (weird how that happenes, song I've heard before become my favourite). The weird thing is that her vocal is much worse than on the demo. They should have left her clear voice, but the whole album's disadvantage is that her voice is very computerized, no songslike Baby Boy, which is not really good for me. But still it's totally hot and electric.  10. Ooh Ooh Baby - what a hot song, what a HOTTTT beginning with this guitar. I love it.  11. Perfect Lover - a potential hit, very good and popular hip-hop style, very hot and sexy.  12. Why Should I Be Sad - good ending song, familiar bell in the background, very nice and relaxing song.      All the songs are hits, aren't they?    Potential singles except Gimme More : Piece Of Me (doesn't seem like the best song, but the style is very popular and the song is just electric). Break The Ice - I am 100% positive that this WILL be a single, because it's awesome, perfect formula for a hit, catchy music and the best vocal ever. Toy Soldier - would be a good single. Hot As Ice - I doubt it because her voice and the music is too computerized comparing to the demo but I wish it could be. Perfect Lover - very modern, very cool, great potential. Ooh Ooh Baby could be a hit too, other songs aren't worse and would most likely work.     So BLACKOUT is a state of art, it's totally electric and catchy, hot and sexy, joyful and fun.    For us, fans, it's sad that there is not much of Britney's personality like in her other albums, everything is kind of computerized and packaged. I mean it's totally a high quality album, but I don't see Britney in some songs. She did not even write anything in the booklet.     It is definitely one of her BEST ALBUMS and one of THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE DECADE for sure.    I love its urban, European, techno music style. Britney is on FIRE. She is hot and she is the best. Like we had any doubts, right? :)    It is a critically acclaimed album and that's what matters. Sales don't matter. Actually, very often critics and people like album but it doesn't sell that much and in other occasions critics hate it, but it sells and it's good. It's all diferent and it all depends on artist. I really hope that it sells but what matters to me is Britney and the fact that she HAS FANS and WE LOVE HER. WOO-HOO. 30th of OCTOBER isa HOLIDAY FOR ME.        The photoshoot for the album is one of her best. HOT, SEXY, REVEALING. I just love it. The Confessional shoot, the Dressing Room,The Phone Call picture, The Red Flower Room , The Roses On The Floor Room - everything is hot! I love that blue dress picture - it's the best. Confessions photos are so sexy, I can't stop looking.
B000063JDE|5.0|It's odd how I got around to David Lynch.  I'd just started hanging out with the guy who is now my best friend and he borrowed me a VHS (remember them things?) copy of Wild at Heart.  Well, the head bashing was nice, but I couldn't make it through more than 30 minutes.  After that it kind of faded, I didn't even know the director at the time.<br /><br />Fast forward to the release of Mulholland Dr.  My interest peaks, and is more than saturated with an overabundance of intense metaphorical symbols and brilliant casting.  So, I rent Blue Velvet and, my god, I got what I got from M.D. times 100.<br /><br />Blue Velvet is, more or less, like watching a nightmare, like if Bunuel had raped Hitchcock after he had raped Herzog, or something along those lines.<br /><br />This is what a gripping movie should be; intelligent, well written, and when it's over you think to yourself, \\"wait, it's over already, DAMNIT, GIMME MORE!\\" (apparently it was originally around 4 hours long, but all the missing stuff has long since disappeared.)<br /><br />The story is simple, and noirish, in the fact that it's a simple young man entering a world he had no clue existed, being shoved into the absurd, vile and deranged world of one particular fellow by the name of Frank, and his victims.<br /><br />After my initial viewing of Blue Velvet I went for more Lynch; I was not disappointed in anything I saw, save for, haha, Wild at Heart which, to this day, I've not been able to get all the way through.  I can't help it, I hate Cage, I hate Elvis and I hate the Wizard of Oz.  I haven't seen Dune, and don't think I ever will...<br /><br />I've seen Blue Velvet, i think, 4 times now, and I plan to view it many more times in the future.<br /><br />and an additional note, Brad Dourif has THE coolest laugh ever.
1416523359|2.0|Didn't like this book much.  Kept waiting to like it.  Didn't.  SK's books don't have to be scary, gory thrillers for me to like them.  They do however need to be coherent.  Glad I got this one at the library instead of buying it..
0321344758|5.0|I use this book as a \\"must read\\" for my Visual Design class. It is a great introductory book of design principle for interactive media and the way we use the web. It points out the obvious in an understandable way and keeps my students hooked (which is sometimes hard to do!). Hilarious and easy to follow. I read the entire book on a 2 hour flight...and I don't mind reading it again each semester.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie is a truly masterpiece. Very beautifully done. I've watched it a few times and still cant get enough. Awsome!
0844230006|5.0|If you want to cut to the chase about how to be more creative, this is the book for you.  Young breaks the creative act into its basic points in as straighforward a fashion as possible.  It is a very short book, which can be digested in probably 20 minutes or less, but leaves you with all you need to know to get started.  The book has no creativity activities or exercises like other books of its kind, but focuses instead on the main principles and basic methods for producing creative ideas.  This is the book to begin with if you aspire to more creative production in your life.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|You can't judge this album upon first listen it grows on you.  People are just giving this album a bad name because it doesn't feature the original lineup.  There wouldn't be a huge difference Billy writes everything himself anyway.  Theres a lot of great tracks on this album, and as for softer songs try downloading the album track Zeitgiet its a really good acoustic song.  Billy Corgan is still an amazing songwriter and he is not washed up he can still rock at age 40 along with Jimmy.  This isn't there best cd by any means its still a good addition to any true pumpkin fans collection.  This album is dark and shows a lot of emotion.  There might not be epic tracks like Cherub Rock or Mayonaise but the cd does have its moments and in time I'm sure will be a classic like there other cds.  Heres hoping that the whole band will reuinte in the near future.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|What to say that hasn't already been said?...I am still in shock from this album. I've been listening to \\"In the Zone\\" for the past 3 years & up until now it was one of, if not my absolute favorite dance album. Blackout truly leaves \\"In the Zone\\" in the dust. \\"Gimme more\\" had me dancing the first time I heard it. Every other song is a dancers dream. The only song I am having trouble really getting into is \\"Hot as Ice\\". It doesn't have the sexy sleekness that I like in Britney's music. Songs that DO are the INCREDIBLE bonus track \\"Get back\\", \\"Perfect Lover\\" and \\"Get Naked\\". I've always loved Electronic music so I have no complaints about Britney's voice being worked over. I like it that way actually. I just cant get enough of \\"Piece of Me\\". It's got a very interesting sound and a driving beat- great song to sing to in the car!  \\"Freakshow\\" has an awesome beat that hits you over the head and is in my opinion the best dance song here.  I love it! Couldn't ask for more!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Users who will rate the cd 1 star based on personal judgement, or hate should just shut it, ur pathetic. FOR THOSE OF YOU actually listening to this album will know that it's music magic. Move your body and escape your mind.. BLACKOUT is a hit.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Being a fan of the Underworld series as well as the lovely Kate Beckensale, I had to purchase this movie on blu-ray. I have this movie on every format except vhs. All I have to say is that this movie looks and sound awesome on blu-ray. If you want good demo material get this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Britney Britney Britney..  Why can't you just make good music?  This is ten times worse than her previous efforts, and it's sad to say this album has no standouts.  When one of the best songs is \\"Gimme More,\\" a very mediocre pop song, you know something is wrong.  1 star Britney, you'll need to do more to get back to your long gone status.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|gimme more. 9/10. the beat is sick the lyrics are okay, catchy but repetitive  piece of me. 10/10. sicks lyrics, nice anthem from her to the media, the beat is simple/synth but yet new.  Radar. 8/10 nice song, like the ending and beginning of the song. but get get back in my opinion is better.  Been a while. 8/10 this was on my top list, and now this here made it beyond, i like the new feel on it also the words don't overlap as before.   heaven on earth. 6/10 throwback to the 80's yes European style but there could have been something here to make it stand out, and the song is too long.   Get naked. 10/10 no shame no game, this song is a killer. it's catchy it has everything you want in a great track lyrics awesome. makes you want to sing along and get naked captures a raw sexual tension. Radio hit right here.  FreakShow 9/10 once again radio hit here...toxic beats  toysoldier 10/10 surprisingly i like... top lyrics in the whole album...is this also another punch to kevin... \\"This time I need a soldier I'm sick of toy soldiers, I'm so damn glad that's over\\"\\"Brit, I heard he said he could stay if you wanted to\\"   Hot as ice 7/10 it was okay before i liked her weird voice but is better now still i wanted something more because i was expecting more energy.   ohh oohh baby 9/10 is like old britney once again. is pure pop not trying to be anything else.  perfect lover 8/10 is this Neptune's?no is not. This is a song for the album but not for release. she sings  great here tough.. \\"tick tock tick tock come get me while im hot\\"  why should i be sad 9/10 nice r&b/pop song to end the album. would do good in urban radios    THIS ALBUM IS LIKE A TRANCE ROLLER COASTER is the future of adultsynth-pop. It brings something new to the now dull world of pop.   She's back
0143038419|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I gave up at the end of the India section. Italy section was enjoyable, but the author's whining, crying, and unending self-exploration did me in. I wish I had not bought this book.
B000SFZ05C|5.0|This is one of the best albums that Cult ever made. Hard rock with Gothic and alternative complexion plus a unique voice from a great singer...gives an outstanding result that comes out to eternity!
B000AXWV40|5.0|Released in 1971, Maggot Brain is a freaky, funky, hard-rockin' blast of acid-mangled psychedelic soul, as performed by what may be the greatest band of inspired weirdoes since the Velvet Underground. These seven songs are sweaty funk-rock masterpieces, stuffed with elements of everything from Motown-informed soul to guitar-screeching proto metal. What's not to like?     The title track alone is worth the price of admission: It features guitarist Eddie Hazel playing one of the greatest instrumental solos ever recorded, a nearly ten minute long tour-de-force of sky-melting, soul-shredding psych-soul telekinesis that rivals even Jimi Hendrix's most inspired moments. The whole piece bleeds with raw emotion and acidic virtuosity, never slipping into pretension or bombast.  And on to p of that, you get a totally sweet piece of brain-bending poetry from ringleader George Clinton (which, by the way, is not nearly as meaningless as some people seem to think it is).     After that, there's six more tracks of wigged out funktasia. \\"Can You Get To That\\" and \\"You And Your Folks, Me And My Folks\\" are sweaty, rhythmic groovers with socially conscious lyrics and swirling vocal harmonies, while \\"Back In Our Minds\\" features some wonderfully deranged percussion and singing. \\"Hit It And Quit\\" sports a riff that'll tattoo itself to your brain forever, and rhythms that are deeper than the Grand Canyon. \\"Super Stupid\\" is a pounding firestorm of guitars and organs. \\"Wars Of Armageddon\\" closes out the album with an epic slice of divinely messed-up soul-funk-psych-rock-metal apocalypse.      So, Maggot Brain rules. Get it and boogie.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|When I first heard of Michael Buble, I thought he was just going to be a Harry Connick wannabe, but he is in a class of his own. In my opinion, he doesn't simply have a beautiful voice; his singing style has a lot of character too. I feel like he's really enjoying himself when he's performing.<br /><br />After falling in love with \\"It's Time,\\" I figured \\"Call Me \\"Irresponsible\\" could only be a disappointment. How happy I am to be wrong! Buble is awesome here, and there are a lot of great songs to enjoy besides the hit \\"Everything.\\" I love \\"It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio Stasera),\\" the duet with Boyz II Men (\\"Comin' Home Baby\\"), and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" w/Ivan Lins. I often don't enjoy remakes of classic songs by newer artists, but when Buble is singing them, I find myself forgetting what the original sounds like! He makes everything sound terrific. Even \\"Me and Mrs. Jones,\\" despite not having quite enough soul for my taste or some reviewers, is pretty darn good.<br /><br />Listening to Buble always puts me in a great mood, so go ahead and buy this CD if you don't have it already. You'll be glad you did!
0761145613|5.0|This calendar is fun.  My children love the stickers and I like that it has columns for each member in the family.  Sometimes everyone has something happening on the same day and a regular calendar wouldn't have the space.  I keep it coordinated with my computer calendar and we stay on track for the month.  This is the second year I am using it.
0757302661|2.0|I felt the book itself gave me much more confidence in approaching my child birth experience, and I practiced the techniques and breathing from about my 4th month. However, my experience was that of a turned baby (facing back instead of forward) and yes the techniques helped me cope through 8 hours of relentless back labor... but in the end, it was an epidural and an experienced midwife who turned the baby. I got the natural delivery I wanted, but definitely not without immense pain - even though I was controlling my breathing until the end. My husband and I put off the intervention for longer than necessary - mostly due to my belief in this technique. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone (mine has been thrown out).
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It may seem silly for Britney to release an album amidst the custody battle, the negative press and the poor image being displayed across TVs and gossip websites across the US, but if you hear this album, you'll be glad she did. The album is up-tempo and fun from start to finish. There's not a bad track on this album. Personal favorites include \\"Toy Soldier,\\" \\"Freakshow,\\" \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" and \\"Piece of Me.\\" It's incredible music and it's definitely worth a listen (and a purchase).
1594489505|5.0|This book is excellent!  A must read.  I have also read The Kite Runner and continue to learn so much about life in Afghanistan, much more than what we are taught in the news.  This book clearly conveys the struggles women face and how even in turmoil the love of one's country never dies.  This story of friendship and struggle in times of tragedy turns into a story of courage and love.  The book was hard to put down and with all of the tragedy the characters faced, including poverty, death, betrayal, and abuse, was captivating and easy to discuss with my book club.
B000W1V44I|5.0|being a diehard fan, i cant but help to love this new album. However, whether you have grown up/along with them or you are a new fan, this album would have to be their best yet! these guys just get better with age! is there nothing that they cant do? despite all the knocks and scoffing they have endured over the past 15(!) years, they rise to the occassion with a brilliant mix of heart-tugging ballads and catchy uptempo tracks that definitely get your legs bopping to the beat. yet again, there is a song that brought me to tears; \\"you can let go\\". i hope that the Backstreet Boys are around for another 15 years. these guys are timeless and priceless, and best of all they adore their fans. they love what they do and have fun doing it. i cant wait for the tour for this album! do yourself a favour..BUY IT NOW! your life will be changed. 100/10 and a million stars.
B000654YS8|4.0|I've been a fan of Dire Straits as long as I can remember, but chose not to get this DVD because I assumed that Dire Strait videos wouldn't be that exciting to watch. Well, despite a few being very dated (eg. Tunnel of Love) this DVD is fun to watch and many of their DVDs are great to watch such as \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Calling Elvis\\". Most of their hits are on here, the obvious ommissions probably didn't have a video made for them. I had never seen the video for \\"Private Investigations\\" or \\"So Far Away\\" so it was great to see them. As another reviewer pointed out, the video for \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is simply amazing.    A wise purchase for all Dire Straits fans.
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|First: I'm not a fan, but given the hype surrounding the release of this CD, I had to listen to it and give it an honest chance. I thought...MAYBE, she'll reinvent herself. Other artists before her have done the same - after a scandal, they'll turn around and release something that no one expects, something that truly showcases their talent, and blow everyone away.    Not so in this case: Britney is simply a pawn in the game, and the game is \\"Britney\\". Any \\"artist\\" that takes her or himself too seriously runs the risk of parody, and the 2nd song on this disc, \\"Piece of Me\\" proves that point in spades.   \\"I'm miss lifestyles of the rich and famous  I'm miss Oh my God that Britney's shameless.....  get in line with the paparazzi that's flippin' me off\\"...    When an artist's personal life is under the microscope, it can be written about in ways that can astound. \\"Layla\\" by Eric Clapton - about his affair with his best friend George Harrison's wife - yet, he doesn't feel the need to namedrop himself.  The whole album \\"Rumors\\" by Fleetwood Mac - about the 2 divorces going on in the band, the affairs, the drugs, all the problems they were going through - yet again, no names were called out.  Simply singing about onesself in the first person is uninspired, and a sign that they take themselves WAY too seriously.    That being said, both the lyrics and music on this CD feels like a step backwards.   The other lyrics reek with the banality of today's brand of pop: cheap, easy couplets thrown together with no sense of direction. (Note: using the word \\"motherfu**er\\" today doesn't shock, doesn't offend - if anything, it sounds like one is trying TOO hard to shock & offend.)  Songs about partying, sex, and of course, \\"no one understands me\\". Same old same old.   The music, while being very, very well produced, is repetitive (not in a good way, mind you) and bland. Cookie cutter beats and uninspired solos exactly where they are expected.    I truly wish Ms. Spears had done something off-the-wall - something like a slower release (Norah Jones or Fiona Apple, for example) - that would have blown minds...but I realize that she would alienate the masses of sheep that buy this sort of product - we can't have that, can we? Not lucrative enough. Forget respect, this product is about the $$$, and don't let anyone tell you different.     I think Britney has a decent voice, and that she does indeed have talent - but it's certainly not put to use here. The result is a muddled  affair, void of any true creativity, and reeking of banality.  The first star is for effort, and for the single, \\"Gimmie More\\". It's not half bad for a dance track, but the track itself has no real sustenance. Maybe that's not what the producers were going for, but at this stage in her career, it's make or break.   The second star is for the one  really good song here, \\"Hot as Ice\\". It a good dance track with a very catchy melody, but it reminds me of Parliment meets Cameo (and that's not a bad thing). If the rest of the electropop on this CD was of the caliber of this track, it would have been a more successful venture. Sadly, this is the sole true stand-out.       Sure, this CD will sell like hotcakes for a week or two, then it will drop off the charts, and be forgotten.  Knowing this is probably her last #1 is the fault of both her producers and herself...she had the chance for the comeback, and with \\"Blackout\\", she blew it.
B00005LK95|5.0|I found myself laughing again as I watched this sequel to the first. I like computers and the plot just lets my mind run free.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|B is back, people! For one minute, let's put aside the fact that her life has more crazy drama in it that any soap opera author could ever come up with and focus on the album itself. Just how good is it? Well, it turns out Britney did something we never thought she could do again: knock our socks off. You want Blackout to be bad, but it's not. Britney still can't sing, her voice is vocoder-ized to death, the songs are her usual trite stuff, but no one does it better than her. Each song on Blackout is a potential hit; on Piece of Me, she makes no apologies for being the trainwreck that she is, and Why Should I Be Sad is clearly her \\"we're through\\" song to K-Fed. Blackout is everything pop should be: infectious, fun and tailor-made for the dancefloor. Whether you hate Britney or worship her, you have to give credit where credit is due: even when her life couldn't possibly get any worse, she still managed to make a wonderful, enjoyable pop album. In fact, it just might be her best album to date. My only concern is that after the VMA debacle, she's going to have to prove that she's still a great performer and that she can still be the Britney that we know and love.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|OK, so I wasnt expecting much from Britney after the numerous incidents from this year, which we just wont talk about. After listening to the demos on the net of all her songs, I was excited. I could tell instantly this album would thrust her back into the limelight of this type of music.<br />Blackout, doesnt black anything out. Its all out there to listen to. It sounds amazing, the beats are HOT, the vocals are slinky, synthesized and catchy. I have listened to Brits back catalogue recently, and all of her previous album have 3-4 filler songs.<br />I can safely say with confidence, that this album has no filler. Its actually possible to listen to start to finish.<br />Highlights from this album are aplently.<br />Gimme More - This is actually one of the weakest tracks on the album. Its freaking hot, but compared to other songs it pales in comparison! 8/10<br />Piece of Me - This is all about Britney and basically her crazy life, its a joy to listen to and its a  real hot track. The producers along with Britney done some top of the line work here. 9.5/10<br />Radar - Catchy, like Toxic, just as infectious! 9/10<br />Break The Ice - What a club anthem! One of my favourites and apparently single #2...great choice! 10/10<br />Heaven on Earth - sounds 80s, it sounds kinda out of place, but still a highlight and generally considered the strongest track on the album. I disagree though! 8/10<br />Get Naked - a lot of people dont like this because of the male vocals, but it is hot! Its got a fantastic beat and its club destined! 8.5/10<br />Freakshow - Another huge highlight. Simply awesome. 10/10<br />Toy Soldier - Cant believe the tracks continue to be great!...Toy soldier is another superb track. 10/10<br />Hot As Ice- T-pain like, T-pain produced...another highlight, one of my favourites! 9/10<br />Ooh Ooh Baby - I love the guitar...its a real awesome song to sing a long  to. 8.5/10<br />Perfect Lover - my only downside to the album...dont really love this one too much but its ok. 7/10<br />Why Should I Be Sad - a nice slow beat Pharrel produced song to wrap up<br />this incredible album. Love it. 9.5/10<br /><br />As i said before...forget everything you thought you knew about Britney. All the rumours, truths and craziness. This album is hot. Nothing like before. Its like being in a night club!<br />She really has a prime opportunity to reel new comers with this album. My top Pop album of 2007 by far.t Pharrel produced song to wrap up   this incredible album.

The song set is as follows:  \\"I Will Follow\\"   \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\"   \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\"   \\"MLK\\"   \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\"   \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\"   \\"Exit\\"   \\"In God's Country\\"   \\"The Electric Co.\\"   \\"Bad\\"   \\"October\\"   \\"New Year's Day\\"   \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\"   \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\"   \\"Running to Stand Still\\"   \\"With or Without You\\"   \\"Party Girl\\"   \\"40\\"  The dvd will also have other special features.    U2 know how to make great dvd's & this one is no exception. I can't wait to start reliving the songs again, & see the live concert from the tour. They definitely are the best band in the world, past & present. My only hope now is they do the same treatment for \\"Rattle & Hum\\" & \\"Achtung Baby.\\" Especially the latter. Hey, dream out loud.

0370007727|5.0|This book is a classic-- with it's caldecott award illustrations and timeless story-- Maurice Sendak has written a true  favorite!  I remember my school librarian (In elementary school!) oohinga nd aahing over reading us this one, and now it's my favorite to read to my son each night.  He (at 2 1/2) loves it too.    Buy it now!

0316067598|5.0|My brother-in-law was in the navy and attended the Academy with a number of the folks mentioned in this book.  I also had the pleasure of meeting several of them.  I can remember the day when we received the phone call during from one of his friends during a July 4th visit of the news.      I can remember the feeling I had then but had absolutely no idea of the details.  I can tell you that although I had a lot of respect for SEALs and the Special Forces before reading this book, it's NOTHING compared with the amount of respect they now garner from me.    As a reader wrote in an earlier post, this book had mean welling in tears at moments and so anxious at other moments I had step away for a few minutes.  The last half of this book had me glued to my seat for hours straight.    It truly makes me appreciate the country we live in, the price of freedom, and those who take the oath to protect it.    Marcus had to leave the service in order to publish this book (even though he wanted to stay in but felt a greater sense of purpose in tell ing the story of what actually happened) and the proceeds go not to himself but are being use to build rehabilitation facilities and provide other means of post-operative support to these troops who are doing extraordinary things on behalf of our country.    I highly recommend the read!!  You'll be blown away too.

B000V6BE6C|2.0|This is the EXACT opposite of the band's description of the project.  You should still get the album, you may like it BUT I recommend that you disregard the band's idea of what they think it sounds like all together.    This new CD is weak. BUT still VERY Entertaining at the same time. It is NOT heavy by any means - they sound like Firehouse now. So don't let the description and their interviews get your expectations up for a heavy album (it's actually all glam and glitz - as I described, the opposite of the description).    However, having said that I still find it completely catchy and can't get the songs out of my head. + the production quality is amazing. It may sound more poppy than usual because usually only Justin Timberlake is produced with this level of major label sell-to-the-masses quality. This leads me to believe that if I had no expectations for this album, I may really really like it.    If you haven't heard it yet, then expect it to be quite slow and sappy poppy stuff. That way when you hear it you will think it rocks and you will want to listen to it over and over again!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is definitely the best album of Britney so far. She is backkkkk. This album is worth for buying cuz every track in this album are perfect, and you can't skip any track when you listen to this great album. In my opinion I think this must be album of the year.
B000EMGJM2|2.0|I've heard a lot about Van Hunt over the years, so I figured I'd FINALLY buy his CD.  I purchased the first album expecting a major \\"wow\\" factor.  It did not happen for me.  I think his second CD is much better than the first.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I knewI would like the last installment in the Rocky franchise, but Rocky Balboa was even better than expected.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Rocky Balboa is about sixty.  He owns a popular Italian restaurant.  Despite his Philly icon status, he lives a quiet, humble life, driving an old van and keeping a folding chair in a tree by Adrian's grave.  Honoring Adrian, he has never married and has no girlfriend.  Their son, in a corporate job, avoids his awkward attempts at fathering. To top it all off Rocky is facing his last fight, with a much younger opponent.  Why is he doing it?  \\"There's a beast in me,\\" he sadly tells Paulie.<br /><br />The movie has a great message, is tender, and you root for and relate to the Italian Stallion all the way.  Highly recommended.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|There's something both repulsive and seductive about Britney Spear's new image. Her current behavior keeps causing much \\"controversy\\" and gives us a reason not to pay attention to her but we actually don't really know anything about her. We just know her music.    It's evolved in a period of almost a decade : she's morphed into a POP phenomenon (\\"... Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\") into a dance-hit maker queen (\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Toxic\\"). Her new opus, \\"Blackout\\" tries to improve what \\"[[ASIN:B0000DD7LB In The Zone]]\\" began : the sex-filled-dance club hits. Yet somehow it sounds kind of different. In fact \\"Blackout\\" may seem like an experimental record because of the new sound Spears developed with the help of her many talented producers.    \\"Piece Of Me\\" is the perfect example. Vocally, it sounds like a mix of rap and electronic poetry, instrumentally it has the sound of a sadomasochistic sex session. That's what makes this track a strong original possible single.  \\"Heaven On Earth\\" sounds like a retro Kylie Minogue-infused pop techno mix while \\"Freakshow\\" and \\"Toy Soldier\\" are two \\"heavy\\" tracks which rest on major drums and well written lyrics. \\"Hot As Ice\\" is like the \\"Toxic\\" of \\"Blackout\\" (I'm not talking qualitatively but musically). The last two songs of the album, with \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" its only \\"ballad\\", are hybrids of the sexy beats of the Pussycat Dolls and Spears's charming fragile voice. \\"Get Naked (I Got A Plan)\\" is an odd hypnotic dance song and its main chorus will definitely   stay in your mind for a long time after you hear it. Finally \\"Break The Ice\\" is the closest thing to Spears's old work and may remind you of hits like \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\".     In other words, \\"Blackout\\" deserves to be listened and judged as an album and not as a proof of dignity (although it'd be a strong one). It's not the artist's best one but it's something different and unique of its own.    Definitely listen to :  - Gimme More  - PieceOf Me  - Break The Ice  - Get Naked (I Got A Plan)  - Hot As Ice  - Everybody (iTunes Bonus Track)
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|With all the problems in Britney's life, it hard to believe that she could pull off making even a decent album, much less the best of her career.  She took control of this project and rejected the assistance of her label and managers, a decision which most perceived to be the downfall of her recording career.  However, somehow, she managed to create, with the help of some amazing production, an adult friendly, infectious group of songs, which play from start to finish without missing a beat.  This music deserves to be heard; I highly recommend this album.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|With \\"Blackout\\", Britney Spears has delivered the strongest and most consistent pop album since the days of Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kylie Minogue's Fever and Janet's Rythm Nation! With not a bad track to be found, Blackout rolls on at warp speed, full of pumping, electonically charged dance beats, catchy hooks and lots of heavy breathing and panting (ofcourse).     With no filler whatsoever, this is by far the best album Britney Spears has ever released, and by no means is \\"Gimme More\\" even close to being the best track on this CD!    Standout tracks and hopeful future singles include the catchy \\"Ooh, Ooh Baby\\" that sounds like Madonna's La Isla Bonita in a techno-club and \\"Toy Soldier\\" (best Britney song ever and guaranteed #1 hit single). Toy Soldier is a catchy, high-energy, beat-intensive party in itself, and sets a high bar on this record. Other instant classics include \\"Break the Ice\\" - a dance floor thumper, and \\"Piece of Me\\" - innovative, futuristic and very groundbreaking. Other tracks like \\"Perfect Lover\\", \\"Freakshow\\" and \\"Radar\\" provide back to back dance-pop candy, and offer a sound more mature, more dance-floor ready and more memorable than any other pop offerings out there today.     Whoever thought Britney didn't have it in her anymore, has been proven way wrong, and this record will play at parties, clubs, homes, gyms and cars, for a very long time.

B000ICL3KG|2.0|I am surprised that this movie got an Oscar, despite its laudable topic. Immediately at the start, Gore tells a joke that insults half of the movie watchers who are not part of the proper persuasion.(The smart thoughtful kid asks,\\"Hey teacher, was South America ever connected to Africa?\\" Not getting an encouraging response, the kid becomes a drug addict and the teacher becomes an advisor to the \\"present administration.\\" Shortened, but you get the idea, non-enlightened people need not apply.) Why was this partisan comment necessary, right at the start! Nobel Peace prize winner in action, indeed!<br /><br />So what he is saying is that if you are a Republican, you are too dumb to understand Global Warming and really ought not to watch this movie. Turn-off that dial now! There is nothing here for you.<br /><br />Then there is sooooo much name dropping. OMG.  \\"My friend, the scientist so and so, who just told me yesterday....\\" To see him resorting to name dropping was kind of pathetic. He seemed like such a sap while doing it, so embarassingly transparent.  Were only FRIEND SCIENTISTS allowed in the making of the movie?<br /><br />But of course, his agenda is more than just name dropping and gaining something by association. His goal is bigger. He comes darn near claiming that he himself is a scientist and that he invented the whole thing. At one point, he looks out the window of a private jet, peers affectionately at earth and pronounces how he has spent a life-time studying the earth. Wow, and I thought he was busy inventing the Internet.<br /><br />Then there is that Simpson cartoon about moonbeams. What does he think that the audience are imbeciles or babies? Why the cartoon? To top it all off in the general scattered vent, he then goes on to play the they-stole-my-presidency song to a happy audience who clap like 3rd graders. How is that evne half-way relevant to Global warming?  Is there any science in this thing at all? Is this all about politics, if so why, he does not explain, other than adopting an air of holiness.<br /><br />I am interested in this material and have read a lot of books on the subject, latest being \\"Cool it.\\". It is unfortunate that most all of the believers park themselves firmly in one camp or the another, when this is just too serious a subject, with costs too great, to do that.<br /><br />I was really disappointed by this movie. It was sophomoric, full of self aggrandizement and grand-standing. He is a politiacn after-all despite his desire for scientific cred ability. Intelligent people of all political colors should avoid this movie as a waste of time.pting an air of holiness.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This show was able to bring me to tears, laughter and anger, right along with the characters. It is true I related to Angela when this show came out, and that may have prompted me to like it all the more. I think the adolescent years are full of confusion and doubt, and this show captures that beautifully. The lessons Angela and her peers learned, are lessons we all must learn, over and over again. Now I am 26 and I still wish they'd continued this show for many seasons.    Also, someone mentioned the way Claire Danes would cry as being annoying. I feel it is moving that she cries in a real way, not all pretty and fake. Claire Danes is still an amazing actress and one thing she is exceptionally good at is maintaining balance in her portrayal of characters. The deep sadness also gives way to pure joy. That is what life is all about.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|No, Britney didn't produce the album. And yes, her personal life is a hot mess. Putting aside all of these (irrelevant) details, Blackout is a fun album. Naturally, Britney should maximize on her strengths, namely, making good dance/club hits, and in this album, she does just that. If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.     Top picks: Gimme more, Get naked, Break the ice, Ooh ooh Baby  Worth skipping: Heaven on earth, Hot as ice (They should have replaced one of these with \\"Get back,\\" which, for some reason, didn't make it onto the album.)

0143038419|2.0|I really enjoy Ms. Gilbert's writing style but find her story superficial, her self absorption monotonous, her spiritual 'insights' trite & lightweight, her whining tedious & seemingly never ending(I have great sympathy for the ex-husband that she casually vilifies and I worry for Phillipe), her perspective immature, and her lack of critical thinking disturbing (throw reason and the intellect out the window, we believe what is comforting!). I've almost finished the section on India and I'm having to force my way through the book. To paraphrase: it's all 'me me me me me'.     Finished the India part and will stop here. It appears that Ms. Gilbert super sized her ego during her stay at the Ashram, exactly the opposite I would have expected. For the moment I'm going to put the Bali Harlequin Romance section on hold. I suggest Ms. Gilbert and her devotees detox themselves with a good dose of 'The Guru Papers'. I also agree with other reviewers that what is truly disturbing is not the book but its popularity.

B000W1V44I|5.0|Unless you have grown up with the boys like I have, this purely defines their maturity. They went from world-class pop artists to well-redound singers that still leave people asking for more.     With Unbreakable, they defy all obstacles of expermentation of vocals. \\"Treat Me Right,\\" which defies a synthetic hook that vibes with today's real music has definitely caught my ears when I first heard it. Other songs like \\"Helpless When She Smiles,\\" depict that they're still into the ballad genre, but other songs like \\"Downpour,\\" still leave me breathless that the boys are growing into their own vocals, minus the exception of Kevin Richardson.    If you purchase this album today (maybe soon), check it out, you won't be disappointed. Keep the pride alive!
0060589469|3.0|In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig apparently achieved what many philosophers desire, but simply do not have the skill or perseverance to do.  That is, he wrote a work of philosophy that received immense attention and success from the popular culture and audience.    An immense part of this success probably lies in his blending of narrative with philosophical inquiry.  He also has clear prose that allows everything to flow together quite nicely.  Once you are sufficiently involved in the narrative and developing line of thought, you are allowed to move on naturally into more involved lines of philosophical thought that you might never have sought to understand otherwise.  Pirsig also brings up a number of troubling issues about the way that we think and the way that we live: something seems wrong with our lives.  He has a lucid manner of illustrating these dissatisfactions and confusions, which pull us in even deeper in anticipation of where he will end up.    This is all very good, but after all, this book is supposed to be an inquiry into values, a philosophically moving work.  So what we really want to know is: should we take seriously the conclusions that Pirsig reaches in this book?  Does he present a serious challenge to the more commonly held theories of reality and `Quality', and provide a robust new vision for living?   I think here Pirsig misses the mark on several counts.  First off, when all is said and done it's not clear at all that he has provided a rich new vision for living.  From the standpoint of philosophy, Pirsig often makes intractable jumps in his reasoning as well as unqualified assumptions that severely weaken his case.  The most fatal instance of this is in his attempt to show that the \\"dualistic\\" understanding of reality cannot make room for Quality.    Here I will only attempt to give a few concise examples of the problems that plague Pirsig's reasoning in Zen.  Unfortunately as a short review I must be quite brief and a bit shallow in analysis.  But my only intention here is to give readers incentive to be cautious about thinking seriously about some of Pirsig's claims by showing some serious flaws in his thinking.     In one instance, on 40-44 we enter a discussion about whether the law of gravity exists objectively or only in our minds.  There are extensive problems with the argument, but only a few need mention here.  Pirsig asks if the law of gravity existed before the earth, sun, moon, or anything material existed, and having no mass, no energy, not in anyone's mind, and not in space (41).  Now Pirsig seems to think that the law of gravity did not exist at this point.  But then Pirsig makes an absurd jump in his reasoning.  He concludes that the only rational conclusion is that the law of gravity did not exist before Isaac Newton.  But he clearly has given no support for this claim.  Why not think the law of gravity existed after the beginning of the universe, but before Isaac Newton?    From this intractable argument Pirsig proceeds to claim that the law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads (42).  He characterizes Newton's discovery of gravity as Newton's having discovered disembodies words that had been floating around for billions of years.  But why think anything like that?  Is Pirsig now assuming some unfamiliar philosophy of language?  Why not think that Newton simply discovered regularity in nature that can be articulated by human language?  At any rate Pirsig has not given us nearly enough to take his claim seriously.    Of course the natural next step is that \\"the world has no existence whatsoever outside the human imagination\\" (43).  But it's clear from above that no such thing has been demonstrated.  Some at this point may feel that I am being unfair or mischaracterizing Pirsig's argument.  But this is hardly so.  Simply put, there is little substance to this argument (and many others in his book) examined carefully.    Another problem is thatPirsig is simply careless in some places in his assumptions or by not defending some assertions he makes.  For instance, early on and at other random times in the book, Pirsig mentions the Buddha as an aspect of reality as if the reader would never dispute the truth of Buddhism (i.e. 21-22).  On the other hand, his ridiculously brief consideration of Christianity, which has probably had the biggest effect on western culture than any other movement, amounts to his saying that \\"\\"Heaven above\\" fades from meaning when space-age consciousness asks, Where is \\"above\\"?\\" (237).  Pirsig claims that Christianity has lost relevance and comprehensibility.  But for whom?  Not only does he not explain what he means, but he seems to ignore the fact that Christianity really is relevant and comprehensible for hundreds of millions of people today, even many living in the \\"space-age\\".  On the other hand, it's fine to employ Buddhism at points as an unqualified assumption.    The biggest problem for Pirsig is that he does nothing to show that the \\"dualistic\\" conception of reality cannot allow for Quality.  The dualistic conception is (to be overly simple) that we are subjects that are distinct from the objects in the world.  Pirsig spends much of the latter part of his book explaining his conception of Quality, which involves Quality as the source of everything, in response to the failure of the dualistic conception to deal with Quality.  Yet it's not clear from any point in Pirsig's analysis that the dualistic conception is inadequate to include Quality, or beauty, or spirituality, or anything aesthetic or emotional.  How does the distinctness of subject and object prevent these things?  Why cannot beauty be a quality of objects?  It is interesting that Pirsig seems to ignore contemporary philosophy that studies aesthetics from a \\"dualistic\\" standpoint.  Many have accepted this picture and found ample room for a richness of beauty and quality that is in no way hindered by the distinctness of subject and object.    In addition to this, Pirsig seems almost incoherent about his theory of Quality.  He wants to say that it is indefinable.  Yet he tries to explain his theory of Quality in detail.  On some level he recognizes this dilemma.  Nevertheless, despite his normally clear prose, his explanation of Quality is mostly unhelpful.  I looked at many of these sections carefully without much progress.  I take it that this is not because he has something deeply profound to say, but that he himself does not sufficiently understand what he means so that he can articulate it.  If he understood it well enough, he ought to be able to articulate it as he does so well in the rest of his book.    Though I don't doubt some will disagree about this last point, the fact remains that there is no good reason for us to throw our common sense out the window and go with the evasive theory that Pirsig presents, a theory that by the way has received virtually no attention in professional philosophy.  (And I'd add here that Pirsig's dismissal of \\"common sense\\" is also supported by weak reasoning)  Pirsig in the end gives us no reason to move towards his solution.    Whether Pirsig intended it or not, he has not really provided us with anything approaching a robust and meaningful way of how to live our lives.  In part, this is probably a result of the evasiveness of Quality itself.  It's a bit baffling that so many find the philosophy deeply affecting and inspirational, whereas we are not truly given a rich sense of how to live our lives and how to treat others.  We are given the picture that all is Quality.  Yet we have been told Quality is indefinable, and in a sense beyond understanding.  We fail even to find in his narrative something of a way we ought to live.    All that Pirsig discusses is not necessarily bad.  I like that Pirsig points out some misunderstandings about the `scientific method', specifically that a big part of it is not methodical but sometimes simplythe result of imagination or accident (though again I think he takes his conclusions a step too far here).  Also, Pirsig does make some good distinctions and presents a number of problems with the way we live that certainly need attention.  Our educational system is one of those issues.    Nevertheless, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book because it contains a wealth of misleading philosophy.  I'm sure that many people when reading Zen have been taken in by the problems with our world and the intellectual puzzles that Pirsig discusses, thinking then that his solutions to these issues are the only salvation.  But nothing could be further from the truth.

B000UJ24SC|5.0|Black Dahlia Murder is a near unstoppable force plain and simple. this album shows the strong progression they've made from their early days. Combining the best Unhallowed and Miasma had to conjure up this little bit. The whole album clocks in around 34 mins, though it feels considerably longer, in a very good way. The whole band brings top notch work to play, drums enhance the atmosphere, the guitar work is damn fine, bass deserves a tip of that hat, and Trevor brings his best as well.

I absolutely love the different genres mixed in to make this album a little something for everyone - Easy Listening, a little Electronica, Alt-Pop, R&B with a twinge of Country. If you're a fan who's been enjoying their music since the \\"Get Down\\" days, you'll appreciate how far the Backstreet Boys have come lyrically and artistically. They even let Howie sing on a few tracks! Though Kevin is not around this time around, it doesn't take away from the harmonizing vocals. Can't wait for the tour! ***** of *****
1400095204|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  We read it for our book club.  I learned a lot about Nigeria (I was on the web as I read this, looking things up) and I really enjoyed the story.  It was one of those books that made me sad when it ended.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This truly was one of television's finest moments.  \\"MSCL\\" had an amazing cast, was written beautifully and directed impeccably.  Anything else I say is just going to expand upon those points so I'll try to just keep this brief.  But if you're on the fence about picking this set up, just do it.  There is one episode of this show that works in a school production of \\"Our Town.\\"  The last few minutes of that episode is as strong as anything I've ever seen on television.  Do not let \\"MSCL\\" escape your attention.
B000WCBMA8|3.0|The most appealing thing about the Hives has always been the unvarnished enthusiasm that bubbles forth from nearly every song they perform.  Regardless of whether it's a studio or live performance, the Hives are clearly enjoying themselves a la the Replacements, a band they often evoke.  So it's a little disheartening that the glee on their newest offering, \\"Black and White,\\" sometimes seems forced.  The first studio release since 2004's dazzling, \\"Tyrannosaurus Hives,\\" the Hives at least deserve kudos for taking chances - although with decidedly mixed results.     The album opens with the terrific new single, \\"Tick Tock Boom,\\" archetypical Hives.  From there, the Swedish quintet moves on to explore a variety of genres that sometimes work but in other instances make you wonder exactly what the heck the band was thinking.  Case in point:  the strange instrumental, \\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\" which would have been perfect on the soundtrack of a bad 1950's horror movie or in a Mitchell Brothers production.  But its inclusion here makes you wonder if someone slipped a fast one by the Swedes.  And the piano bit on \\"Puppet on a String\\" sounds like an updated version of the theme from \\"The Addams Family.\\"     The band regroups nicely with \\"Won't Be Long,\\" \\"Square One Here I Come,\\" and the Undertones-ish \\"Return the Favor,\\" but then falters badly on the egocentric \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S\\" which they thoughtfully spell out after lead singer Pelle Almqvist bellows out, \\"We Rule the World!  This is the World!\\"  But several times throughout the disk, the band seems to have an identity crisis, sounding like the Stranglers on \\"Well All Right!\\" evoking the Members on \\"You Dress Up for Armageddon,\\" and Devo on \\"Giddy Up!\\" Note to Pelle et al:  it's been done.    \\"Try it Again,\\" is the album's most ironic tune with lyrics like, \\"Time to learn a lesson...like Pavlov's dog...if something isn't working, why don't you different instead, instead, instead.\\"  Good advice, guys for your next outing.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|There are so many people who have tried to surround Britney with negative energy and make her life more humiliating than she has done to herself and her behavior, but the thing is she is releasing the best album of her career today.  12 tracks, and 11 are very good, and one is just okay but is in a place to let you come down from the first half of the album.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|THE LIVES OF OTHERS received the Oscar for best foreign film last spring. As a result we were able to see it in this country, and I was overwhelmed. The film is the story of an agent of the STASI, the infamous secret police in East Germany before re-unification. According to friends who lived there and were familiar with STASI methods, the film is realistic. It is also an exciting thriller, excellently acted. The film gained in significance, when its lead actor, Ulrich Mühe, died of cancer not long, after he had travelled to Los Angeles to receive the Oscar.
1594489505|5.0|I read \\"The Kite Runner\\" several months ago and loved it; I was primed and ready to read this book and prayerful that it wouldn't suffer from the dreaded \\"sophomore curse.\\"  It didn't.    This is, simply put, an amazing book.  While his first book was about two boys and their struggles, this novel achieves an incredible level of creativity: it is written by a male author who describes the lives of two women with such accuracy and integrity as to make it a classic from the moment it came off the press.  Not since C.S. Lewis' landmark book \\"Till We Have Faces\\" has this been done so well.    Khaled Hosseini tells the story of two remarkable women in a beautiful but traumatized country.  Mariam's and Laila's stories are told in stunning detail, each in her own part of the story.  They come together because they are both married to the same brutal man.  They begin as rivals but soon become necessary and crucial supports for each other.    The setting of this book is the nation of Afghanistan, a country that is beautiful and beloved, but also raped and ravaged by outside forces.  In the same way the country is objectified by evil, so too are these remarkable women.  As they struggle to survive in a place that is torn apart by the Soviet Union, Afghan warlords, the Taliban, and again the warlords I was amazed and moved by their tenacity, creativity, strength, and faith.  They deserved better in this life.     This is a book that will bring you to tears on multiple occasions, but you must read it.   You will be glad you did.    Khaled, you owe it to the world to keep writing.
B000V6BE6C|2.0|I'll first say that I'm not some crazed A7X fan; I don't have any of their t-shirts, I've never seen them in concert, and I certainly don't have A7X tattooed across my back. But when I first came across their Waking the Fallen album, I felt like I was 15 and listening to Metallica's Master of Puppets for the first time. Avenged Sevenfold had a certain power and aggression that scratched a metal itch and left a grin from ear to ear. I really enjoyed that album and thought City of Evil was a logical step in their music progression. Each and every song was caulked full of talent, power, and aggression that had me coming back for more, I was hooked. After listening to those two albums over the past few years, I was really looking forward to their next release hoping it could top their previous efforts.     My first listen to this album had mixed feelings. Something was missing and it wasn't what I was expecting. Not that a surprise would have been unwelcome but this was disappointing, with some songs plain terrible. The music seems to lack the edge that I came to love about these guys. I don't know if they are trying to reach a broader audience base or if their inspiration was checked at the door during the recording.     The first two songs on this album had my interest and left me with hope. The first song, Critical Acclaim, had a different style that took a few listens before it grew on me. Almost Easy had a pretty cool rhythm to it but still lacked the power that I was hoping. The worst song from the previous efforts top the best of this album. The rest of this release led to nothing but disappointment...and even embarrassment.     Following the first two songs, everything about this album is plain and forgettable...with the exception of the song called A Litle Piece of Heaven. This is by far the WORST song that I have listened to in such a long time, regardless of band and genre. How could they even record this? I can't imagine listening to this in the studio and saying, \\"yep, that's a keeper!\\". This sounds like a poorly written song that would be featured in a failing high school musical. There is nothing positive about this song, I can't even commend them on a good effort. I'm in shock that this song is from the same band that wrote so many excellent songs in the past, this is plain terrible. It's such a shame that this the song overshadows anything positive with this album.     In all, I was really hoping for more. A few songs on here would leave me embarrassed if someone caught me listening to them. Those, unfortunately, far outnumber the good songs. I'll look to their previous work to scratch the metal itch; this album missed the metal mark and fell flat on its face.
B000I2J0VK|5.0|Kubrick's final effort is also his greatest masterpiece: a humane and expressionistic fable, endlessly complex and guardedly optimistic.    A few notes about the Blu-Ray disc of \\"Eyes Wide Shut:\\"    The Blu-Ray is the unrated version of the film, meaning it does not have those CGI figures added to the orgy scenes to obscure the simulated sex.  (The CGI figures were added in order to secure a U.S. theatrical release rating of \\"R,\\" without Kubrick's input; their only purpose was censorship.  The version released on Blu-Ray, which was released theatrically in Europe but until now has not been available in the U.S., restores those shots to the way Kubrick filmed them.)    The Blu-Ray disc contains all of the special features from the standard-definition DVD in the boxed DVD set, and they are interesting enough.  The aspect-ratio of the Blu-Ray is 16x9, which is a vast improvement over the old 3x4 DVD, as 16x9 is much closer to the theatrical aspect-ratio for which the film's shots were composed. The High-Definition film transfer is beautiful, pristine, the images luminous and rich.  For a film as beautifully photographed as this, in which the texture of the image conveys essential, visceral meaning, the difference between High-Definition and Standard Def might make the difference between fully receiving the film and not.   If you've gone Hi Def and are thinking of buying this to replace your old standard-def 3x4 DVD, by all means do so.  Short of a new 35mm print of the unrated version, this Blu-Ray disc -- displayed on a big 1080 set in a dark room, uninterrupted -- is how this challenging and ultimately thrilling film should be seen, and seen again.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I honestly didnt expected BLACKOUT to be the great album it is so it caught me off guard. What a nice surprise! Top notch production and from the heavy electro beats and sounds to the catchy choruses and lyrics...Never was a fan of Britneys past albums but Im definately a fan now. How would had thought!? This album is full of good tracks, not a single one is bad and Britney as EXECUTIVE PRODUCER? Didnt see that coming! This is certainly an evolution in Spears music for her best. Long gone are her innocent songs, this is sexed up music at its best and I Love it. GIMME MORE girl, her best album to date and the critics arent lying on that...and you people start judging a star for her music and not her or his personal life. 5 stars from me.
0307275639|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I didn't know what to expect.  It turned out to be a book that I couldn't put down (finished in a day!) and that touched my heart and soul. An inspirational story about life and all the good in it.
0451191153|5.0|The first time I read Ayn Rand was when I was about 18.  It was a life-changing experience.  It was one of those moments when one finds the right words to describe what one feels, especially when one did not know that such words existed or had been expressed.  All my life up to that point, I had been stymied by the will of the collective, as enforced by a domineering father hell-bent on molding me in his image, and a stifling cultural environment that valued fitting-in, rote memorization and academic succee bss as described by narrow definitions limited to doctor and engineer.  I grew up in the hyper-competitive rat race world that is the Indian middle-class, where intelligence, curiosity and creativity are all to be sacrificed at the altar of a steady job and one's total devotion to the pursuit of the ultimate goal, public adulation, typically based on a facade of 'normalcy'.  I had a hard time trying to adjust to a world that constantly told me, \\"Well yes, you are intelligent and have the brains, so why dont you use them to get better grades and become a doctor or an engineer?\\"  Just at the time when this pressure was rising up to a crescendo, I happened to find \\"The Fountainhead\\" in my first year of college.<br /><br />It was like a new dimension had opened up and this person, Ayn Rand, knew exactly the mind-set that I was struggling against.  I recognized the Keatings and the Tooheys I had dealt with and would have to deal with for the rest of my life, and rarely, the other mavericks that walked their own path to their own drumbeat.  I knew instinctively that this was more than a book, it was an instruction manual for a certain type of person.  For others, especially those of the Peter Keating, \\"i want people to love me and I will do anything to fit in\\" mentality and of the Toohey \\"He enjoys what he does and so he must be destroyed\\" mind set, it was a load of crap.  Now, I am sure there are a lot of people that do their own thing, don't worry about others and still don't like Ayn Rand, but for someone thats drowning in a sea of negativity, Ayn Rand is that piece of driftwood that comes at the right time just before one is about to go under.  It gave me the strength to survive the constant barrage of naysayers telling me what I couldn't do, how I was stupid to try things my way, the critiques, the ridicule and stifled laughter behind my back for daring to go against the grain and just for trying something in my life that had nothing to do with their own lives.  In later years, I learned to gauge the degree of 'rightness' of a course of action by the amount of uproar it created among a certain set of people.  I learned to use the negativity to my advantage.<br /><br />The upshot, well, life is an ongoing process, but I am happier through all my successes and failures precisely because they are mine and I have lived them on my terms.  It has been very very hard at times, but I have never felt despair or the need to ask others about the course I need to set at every turn. The successes have been extremely rewarding and the failures, mere setbacks that just make me stronger for the next battle. Reminiscing about the younger days (I am 33 as of this writing) and meeting the sheep-like Peter Keatings that were in my life back then only affirms my self-belief and the strength I got from Ayn Rand when no such reassurance was forthcoming from the people around me.<br /><br />There are several reviews and opinions here, some I agree with and others that I dont.  They all have a right to their opinions, however, my only request to the negative (and some positive) reviewers is, please don't assign current political terminology such as liberal and/or conservative to the Ayn Rand canon. No matter what you think about her ideology and literature, lets get something straight. She talks about individuals and their strength as such. Even her harshest critics will grant her that. The very idea behind \\"The Fountainhead\\" is to be whatever brandof ideologue one wants to be and to have the freedom to be that regardless of public opinion. She cannot be hijacked to serve the purposes of a political party or of any other ideology besides the one that she espouses in her books, that of objectivist individualism. It transcends 'manufactured consent'-era spin doctor created labels such as liberal or conservative that have lost all objective meaning and only serve to evoke knee-jerk responses in the minds of the readers to push the right buttons that spin-mongers have programmed within the collective consciousness.  The ideology that comes closest to her ideals is Libertarianism but even that has branched off into myriad flavors further underlining the fact that individualism cannot be summed up easily into one philosophy.  It means different things to different people, which is exactly the point.to be and to have the freedom to be that regardless of public opinion.

0446677450|1.0|I had to read this book for a business law class...why?  I don't know seeing as how this book holds no pertinence to anything legal, but that isn't the point of this review.      Kiyosaki spends chapters upon chapters talking about things that make you say...DUH.  Over and over again he never actually quite tells you how to make money or how to manage it.  There are absolutely ZERO financial tips.  Everything he talks about is theoretical and quixotic.  Want to be rich?  Well I'll tell you the secret key...save your money and invest it!!!  That is a key example of a major chapter in Kiyosaki's book.      The next part that made me mad was how he kept going on and on about how there is no such thing as getting rich quick.  You can't do it.  There is no scheme, scam, or anything that will make you rich overnight.  In the very next chapter, Kiyosaki then says...now let me tell you how to get rich quick.  What?  Didn't he just spend a chapter talking about how that wasn't possible?      It should be known that if you do your research on Kiyosaki, he never actually made any money through investments or savvy financial knowledge.  He made his money off of selling 'motivational books'.  Remember that term 'motivational' because at the end of his book, he reminds you that everything he wrote was just to 'motivate' you.    Save your money and ignore anything Kiyosaki.
0345494997|4.0|It is hard to find a good novel so intriguing and based on true history. This book, while entertaining, also is informative and made me want to learn more about both Mamah Borthwick and also Frank Lloyd Wright.   Mamah was a strong woman, who back in the early 1900s was willing to stand for what she thought.  Well eductated, and multi-lingual, Mamah could be a role model for women today.    True, she left her children to have an affair with FLW, something I would not choose to do.  But I admire her passion and her willingness to take a stand in a period when this approach would rarely be considered by women.  The book is primarily written about Mamah Borthwick, and less so about Frank Lloyd Wright.  While it gives some insight into his architectural style, the book does not make him a saint.  The description of coming to terms with their early affair, their travels through Europe and Asia and their later days at Taliesen are all riveting.  The book culminates in an astounding ending, leaving you wanting more.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Remember Caligula, with it's R-rated and X-rated version; the debate then was over the relative merits of both, and the same debate now hovers around this film.<br /><br />Forget about that part.  The film is sexually graphic, but not gratuitous at key moments (like in the beginning, when the film is establishing what you're going to be likely to see, or in the moments when personal or a couple's pleasure is a material part of their existence). The rest of the time, as in the club Shortbus itself, the sex is brilliantly gratuitous, in precisely the best way it can be.<br /><br />But again, we went for the sex, but what we got is a film.  John Cameron Mitchell (writer and director, of \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" as well) has now, I'd say, established himself as a filmmaker of preeminent relevance. Both of his films have a very definite, if hard to name, something--a world-weariness that's not exactly jaded, certainly a quirky eye for details that is not merely surreal. To make an irresponsible comparison, brilliant as Charlie Kaufman's movies are, the strange worlds they evoke are always somewhat contrived, perhaps wonderfully so. The strange world that John Cameron Mitchell lets us see are wholly realized, but still a kind of alternate reality. Yes, it's New York. Yes, it's the scene. But at the same time, it's super-real in a way that extremely few other filmmakers can manage.<br /><br />I'm trying not to do spoilers here, but there are three perfect examples of what I mean.  When Sofia and Rob confront the problems in their relationship by using psychological techniques from Sofia's couples counseling practice, this perfectly embeds both the sense and the meaning of their interaction. Similarly, it may not be immediately clear at first why Severin and Sofia should meet in a sensory deprivation tank--maybe it seems like simply a quirky detail--but both the safety of the setting and that sensory deprivation implies a lack of feeling turns out to be exactly the right context to frame that conversation. Even without this insight, the choice of a sensory deprivation tank is wonderful. Still later in the movie, a truth or dare dare has James and Severin in a closet, having a very heart-to-heart conversation. Again, the setting is perfect to the theme, and yet subtle enough without browbeating the viewer, to say nothing of paralleling Severin and Sofia in the deprivation tank as well.<br /><br />I am certain that the entire film is put together with this much care and attention throughout.  Why, for instance, are there two characters (Jamie and Severin) who have alternate names? (That Jamie changes his name to James rather obviously expresses his increasing distance from his boyfriend, Jamie.) One could note also that there is a ton of sex and rock n roll in this movie (look at the long soundtrack list at the end), but not drugs. Or that the overwhelming number of scenes are shot inside; even Sofia's jaunt in the park is not an actual exterior shot.<br /><br />This is just another way to realize that John Cameron Mitchell is showing us a realized (artistic) vision of the world, and not New York itself; a fact emphasized, perhaps, by the animated cartoon version of New York that is the backdrop for the film, and that the ex-Mayor of New York in the film is Tobias, a fictional mayor, but one who is strongly reminiscent of Ed Koch in a number of ways. For those familiar with the controversies surrounding Koch during the AIDS crisis, the admission in the film that the ex-Mayor is gay portends to be not only a sly counterfactual, but even a kind of painful moment of healing for gay New Yorkers who have long felt betrayed by the Mayor. Yes, this is fiction, but it's an alternate reality, where he-who-was-closeted finally tells the truth, as it were.  Mitchell is clever enough to write the scene in such a way that you don't need to know all of this background to feel its pathos; mentioning it here is mostly just to underscore the deliberate wicked craft of the writing. Or, if this may be suggested even more briefly in one other way, as Severin is running a patter for the sake of Sofia's fantasy, there is a line, something to the effect of:  \\"Phil Mudd approached the table and asked, `Is someone sitting here?'\\" The reply is, \\"No one's ever sat there.\\"  That's a brilliant, very outside-of-the-box moment of writing; one that comes from a point of view of long-standing loneliness, where no one ever sits. It's a beautifully perfect thing for Severin to say, all the more poignantly in something she is imagining as a fantasy.  The whole movie is informed by this outsiderness, which was equally palpable in \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, it is this kind of care and attention and coherence that makes the sex not gratuitous, because even Shortbus itself (the sex club) is, again, precisely the context that the film's themes calls for.<br /><br />It is not often that a movie lingers with me after I watch it, and the ones that have, have since entered the pantheon of great movie experiences for me.  In and of itself, this may mean nothing to you, but if you can see past the mere titillation of the film, there's something haunting and effective here. And funny and honest too.<br /><br />Ultimately, the difference between the R-rated and X-rated Caligula was merely sex. By contrast, Shortbus integrates sex deeply into the characters in a way that thoroughly motivates it. Not everything's perfect in this film, and not everyone will be able to get past the sex, but that's okay too. Highly recommended.his may be suggested even more briefly in one other way, as Severin is running a patter for the sake of Sofia's fantasy, there is a line, something to the effect of:  \\"Phil Mudd approached the table and asked, `Is someone sitting here?'\\" The reply is, \\"No one's ever sat there.\\"  That's a brilliant, very outside-of-the-box moment of writing; one that comes from a point of view of long-standing loneliness, where no one ever sits.

B000FA57US|2.0|Well, they put in a good effort, anyway. There is decent lighting and cinematography, and there are some good performances, especially from young Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd Carruthers. This time around, Jamie is confined to a mental ward for children, where she experiences a psychic connection with her uncle, Michael Myers! Yes, Mr. Myers miraculously survived the pounding he took at the finale of part four and he is back to wreak further havoc!! Now, little Jamie can provide clues to help capture the crazed killer before he strikes again!!! This entirely unnecessary film would at least be acceptable if it did not try so hard to rise above its genre. This is not a great work of art; rather, it is a slasher movie (which, if done correctly, is an art form in its own right). What is the point of having a shower scene as well as a sex scene if no nudity is shown?! It is forgivable if there is no nudity in the film, provided there are no scenes that would normally involve actors disrobing. However, if there is both a shower scene as well as a sex scene, there had better be nudity involved; to include one without the other is an affront to fans of this type of film! It is called pleasing your audience; we expect it, so give it to us. While we are on the subject, how can it be acceptable to show graphic violence in a film and not nudity? Which is potentially more psychologically damaging to a delicate, young mind: the human form in its natural state, or one human brutally killing another? Among other annoyances with this film is the extremely poor degradation of two deputy officers, who are made to look quite foolish. The first couple times these two appear onscreen, some very comical, keystone cop-style music plays. It is very much out of place in this film and it is most irritating. At one point later in the film, one of the officers, in self reference, makes a comment to the effect that they are both bumbling and incompetent. It is difficult to fathom something like this being written, let alone making it to the film's final print. Also, the character of Michael Myers in this film appears to be a bit contrived, as though he is doing things simply in an attempt to scare rather than with good purpose. For example, he kills a young man, and then proceeds to pick up the man's girlfriend in his car at an appointed time. He sees fit to wear the deceased's Halloween mask in an effort to trick the young woman into thinking he is her boyfriend, which, of course, works well. When she goes inside a store to buy some cigarettes, Michael changes into his usual William Shatner mask in preparation for killing her. The purpose behind this? I wish I could say. In fact, I struggle to find reason for watching this film more than once. It is almost a shame that Anchor Bay went to such great lengths in producing this DVD; there is commentary from some of the cast and crew as well as a documentary. The transfer looks remarkable and the sound is good as well. Film: 1/5 stars; DVD: 4/5this being written, let alone making it to the film's final print.

Reuniting with her family is maybe THE key for her to keep a well state of mind, and she's done that...the other factor would be a great, hypnotizing, addicting album...and she's done that too! She has things going for her again, and i hope she gives her all!  Highly recommend this album!!!!!!
B000T05R8Q|5.0|One of the most sophisticated psychedelic albums recorded and second to the Beatles Sgt.Peppers in that category. This album was revolutionary and even sounds ahead of now in some places or at least from another planet or dimension. That is Pink Floyd for you. Even in the beginning. I missed buying the 30th anniversary mono version and regretted it after hearing it was the fans choice and had more as far as sound effects the stereo version did not have! Well now I have this mono version. The difference blew me away. I have not listened to the stereo version since. I love the mono version! Interstellar Overdrive sounds much different. There are bits and pieces of Rick Wrights keyboards and Sys guitar you cant even hear or were left out of the stereo version that are essential. And background echoes of Syd's voice also. This album is more psychedelic and more fun to listen to in the mono version. They were recorded different and the mono versions are a ton better when you notice the differences and you will notice right away especially if you are a Floyd fan. I have had the stereo version for over 13 years and have always been a fan of the album since hearing it. The mono version is much better and I can see why it is often referred to as the FANS CHOICE. I heard this term and always questioned why it would be. It is not even the same album. One of my all time favorite albums and this makes it even better. Get this album! Say no to drugs, this is better! And long live Syd Barret!

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Forget her personal problems because that shouldn't be what her career is based on.  It's all about her music and Britney doesn't dissapoint with her fifth studio album.  'Blackout' is what fans have been waiting for and Britney doesn't dissapoint.  It's a solid album from 'Gimme More' until 'Why Should I Be Sad.'  This album contains songs that will definitely be played on the club circuit for years to come.  The highlight of the album is 'Piece of Me' where Britney addresses her harshest critics and gives a self awareness that she knows what's being said about her.  Other highlights of the album are, 'Hot as Ice,' 'Break the Ice,' 'Ooh Ooh Baby,' and 'Heaven on Earth.'  There's not one bad song on this album and it's just th good thing Britney needs right now to get back on track and back to the Britney we all know and love.  A triumph album.  Great job Ms. Spears!
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Ghost in the Shell 2 pushes anime to the next level.  The story is awesome, not to mention the multiple use of combining animation to computer generated images.  The only downfall to this is the Japanese language and English subtitles.  I did some research about having the English translation version, but they were hurting on the budget so they couldn't translate it.  Overall, on a scale from 1 - 10, this one deserves a 9 because of the translation.
B000W1V44I|5.0|ive been a fan of the boys since i heard there first song. And this album was definitely not a disappointment.  In fact, i think its one of there best yet. Ive listened to it over and over, and cant seem to find a song on there that i dont like.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Trick or treat with Britney Spears! Britney pops up just in time for Halloween with \\"Blackout,\\" not only is this her first studio CD in 4 years but it's also one of her very best yet! Her voice sounds perfect on all of the tracks; much more mature and grown-up than on prior CD's. The lyrics are strong because on this record Britney has a lot more to say. She's not the girl next-door anymore. No, this Britney is strong and in control and doesn't need any man to tell her what to do! Besides the lead single, [[ASIN:B000W4HFXO Gimme More]], I also love \\"Peace of Me\\" and \\"Hot As Ice\\" because she sounds so amazing on these tracks. Admit it you know you like her. Or, just like everyone else you're fascinated with her and can't get enough of Britney. There's something about Britney that manages to constantly draw people to her. It's like Britney is a satellite that transfers light to millions of people all over the world through her musical energy!

0765316978|4.0|As a sci-fi novelist, John Scalzi has come a long way in a very short time. No, he doesn't yet have a lot of novels under his belt, having just had his debut book OLD MAN'S WAR published in 2005. But he's already amassed serious cred and clout and an enviable fan following. Personally I count Scalzi as an author just one tier below Bujold, Cherryh, and Weber. But he's climbing fast. The man just keeps on churning out the good books. Case in point: With the very good THE LAST COLONY, John Scalzi closes out his excellent trilogy begun with [[ASIN:0765315246 Old Man's War]] and [[ASIN:0765354063 The Ghost Brigades]] and reacquaints us with that old fogey John Perry and his arse-kicking ex-Special Forces sweetheart Jane Sagan.<br /><br />The setting: THE LAST COLONY returns us to a far future in which intelligent alien races are many, habitable planets are few, and competition for colonization is fierce and downright ugly. So when humanity throws in its two cents, well, extraterrestrial noses (or whatever) get bent out of shape and things get fractious.<br /><br />Plot SPOILERS begin.<br /><br />The plot: Years ago John Perry and Jane Sagan gave up their super-augmented bodies and retired from the CDF (Colony Defense Forces). Their consciousness having been transferred to more human forms, they've since gotten married, adopted the daughter of a treasonous genius scientist, and have settled on the backwater planet of Huckleberry. It's a humdrum farming existence which would last for 8 peaceful, contented years. This ends when John and Jane are asked by the CDF to act as leaders of the colonization of the planet Roanoke (history buffs will know that naming a venture like this \\"Roanoke\\" isn't exactly good karma).<br /><br />John and Jane don't say no, and soon they find themselves travelling in a colony ship with their teenaged daughter Zoe, her two Obin minders, and a seed population of twenty-five hundred colonists hailing from ten long-established human worlds. But things shockingy go wrong when the colony ship is sabotaged and ends up orbiting an unfamiliar and hostile planet. Wait - it gets worse. It's not enough that the lost colony is now forced to eke out a desperate survival on a strange planet, having to make do with primitive equipment and with the colonists suddenly being hunted by frightening monsters. It's not enough that the colony then finds itself the object of an all-out manhunt (colony hunt?) by the Conclave, a powerful consortium of alien worlds which had banned colonizing by non-members. On top of that, the Perrys are further rocked by the realization that the Roanoke colony may actually be nothing more than a soon-to-be-discarded pawn in some long range scheme of the Colonial Defense Forces.<br /><br />Scalzi weaves in a lot of dirty, holier-than-thou politics and worldview manipulation in this series, and he makes it all compelling and key to the story arc. The CDF - in its worthwhile goal of furthering humanity to the stars - has overreached itself. It dawns on John and Jane that their worst enemies just might be lurking from somewhere on their side. And when John Perry finally has had enough of being manipulated and effed with and decides to do something about the dirty laundry, well, what he comes up with is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />SPOILERS end.<br /><br />John Scalzi has stated that, while he may return to this particular universe, this is the last he'll write of John Perry and Jane Sagan. If that's true (and you never know), then it's a very good send-off indeed. THE LAST COLONY isn't as action-packed as OLD MAN'S WAR and THE GHOST BRIGADES, but it's thought-provoking and thrilling and it draws you in. And, when called for, it's certainly action-packed enough. A familiarity with the two prior books isn't necessary as Scalzi does  a good job of filling in the blanks for new readers. But if you've read the other books, this one will resonate even more.<br /><br />The thing about this book (and this trilogy, really) is that, underneath all the hard hitting special effects and gut-churning action and well-fleshed-out world building, it's still all about the characters. THE LAST COLONY may take place in the far future and involve sundry alien races and jaw-dropping technological advances, but Scalzi populates this universe with characters who are recognizable and all too human. And complex. In the beginning of the book, I made ready assumptions regarding Perry's very political chief rival, and that character arc didn't at all go the way I expected. Same goes for the leader of the alien Conclave. And so it goes with other characters. The awesome Jane Sagan, who appears in all three books, is a fascinating character, a clone forever questioning her humanity even as she kicks righteous booty. Zoe, John and Jane's fiercely loyal adopted teen, is simply marvelous. The snarky Savitri, John and Jane's right hand woman, also got to me. As for John Perry, I loved him in OLD MAN'S WAR and he doesn't let me down here. A superb protagonist in possession of insight, a dry wit, a moral compass, and a great humanity. If I were caught up in the dire crappola in which the Roanoke colonists found themselves, I would want someone like Perry to call the shots. And someone like Jane Sagan to back him up.<br /><br />If you happen to enjoy these three books and if you aren't aware of this yet, you might want to also look up [[ASIN:1596061030 The Sagan Diary]], a novella which is sort of a cousin to this trilogy. Although, truth to tell, THE SAGAN DIARY isn't as much a novella as it is a series of diary entries written by Jane Sagan as she makes personal observations regarding war, humanity, love, etc. It's interesting stuff. Another book to look forward to is the upcoming [[ASIN:0765316986 Zoe's Tale]] (I'm assuming this one's about Zoe Perry). Lastly, the only disgruntlement worth mentioning about THE LAST COLONY is that Scalzi seems to have forgetten (or forsaken?) the original and quite scary Roanoke natives.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|When you first listen you are a little uncertain with the New Album. It has a different sound to it that takes a couple of times of listening to to get trully into. Similar to Gwen's Latest CD. But after that you come to trully appreciate the Album and realise that it is probably by far the best album of her career!

B000UR366S|5.0|Having anticipated Shine it was so convenient to order. I got what I wanted from Joni Mitchell and Amazon helped get her to me quickly.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the \\"Grind House\\" project is nothing short of a mile-a-minute thrill ride.  From beginning to end, it's just nonstop excitement, and tons of fun.  It's a bit more straight-forward than your average QT film.  The plot is pretty simple, and doesn't skip around chronologically, and the experimental camera effects are kept to a minimum (with only a grainy, retro-70's picture quality, and one scene that inexplicably switches to black and white).  However, most of the usual \\"Tarantisms\\" are there, like the excellent dialogue and random pop culture references, the campy, over-the-top violence, and of course the obligatory nod to Quentin's foot fetish.<br /><br />So, the story we have here is about a fellow named Stuntman Mike, a crazed ex-stunt driver who preys upon young women, using as his weapon of choice a tricked-out muscle car that is 100% \\"death proof\\"....at least to him, anyway.  Mike carves a bloody trail across the countryside, until he meets his match in a group of young stuntwomen with a few skills of their own.  What ensues is one of the greatest car chases I have ever seen, right up there with the famous train scene in \\"The French Connection\\".  It's surprisingly long, but never too long.  Even more amazing is the incredible Zoe Bell, who actually spends half of this scene clinging to the hood of a speeding car that is wildly careening and colliding with the other vehicle.  This is one tough chick.<br /><br />And of course Kurt Russell is fantastic as Mike.  He's creepy and terrifying, yet still oddly likable.  With all the more family-oriented movies he's been moving toward in the past few years, it's really great to see him play this type of role again.  He may be getting up there in age, but he's definitely still got it.<br /><br />Yep, this one is highly recommended for sure.  It probably won't be winning any Oscars, but it's a fun action flick that never feels mindless or dumb.  I was disappointed that this one and \\"Planet Terror\\" weren't released as a single package, but oh well.  Either way, this one's definitely worth checking out.ased as a single package, but oh well.  Either way, this one's definitely worth checking out.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|as with most people have said in previous comments, considering the issues of her personal life magnified into larger than life stories, Brit's new album definitely delivers and is an album that would not disappoint.  This is a much better dance album than her previous album.    If only she could put on a good performance and shoot a better video.  The songs certainly have potential to put her back on the #1 list.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Oh man, where do I begin?  I think I have probably seen just about every major superhero-themed movie that's come out in the past 20 or 30 years or so. Some are really good, some are really bad.  This one, however, gets the dubious honor of being the absolute worst I have ever seen.  I mean, there is practically nothing about this movie that I found appealing, at all.  The only thing that even comes close is just the fact that Jennifer Connelly is in it, but even the loveliness of her presence can't save this one (go rent \\"The Rocketeer\\" if you want to see her in a super hero-ish movie that's actually good).<br /><br />So again I ask, where do I begin?  Well, let's start with the overall pace of the movie.  Although I realize that origin and exposition and all that good stuff is essential, especially when introducing a hero, it's done at such an excruciatingy slow and boring pace that by the time Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, I really just don't care anymore, and unfortunately there's nothing after that to recapture my interest.  The action sequences are disappointing, and really badly done (especially the \\"climactic\\" scene at the end, in which Bruce battles his father).  Really uninteresting script altogether, if you ask me.<br /><br />Another big miss for me is the effects.  The Hulk looks really goofy and cartoonish, and his size seems to be sort of inconsistent.  He looks less like the Hulk, and more like the Jolly Green Giant on Steroids.  And as I mentioned before, the battle scene at the end is just super-lame.  You never really get to see a good shot of what his father is supposed to look like, and the camera shots of them fighting are so dark and choppy you have no idea what the hell is going on.<br /><br />Now, if all of the above wasn't bad enough, here's what REALLY killed it for me: the split-screens.  Oh dear lord, the split screens!  If you think the show \\"24\\" overuses this effect, wait till you see this!  They are thrown in almost every few seconds, seemingly for no apparent reason.  At one point in the movie, I was actually saying to myself \\"Please, no more split-screens, no more split-screens!\\", and sure enough, here comes another one!  I was seriously on the verge of having a Lewis Black-style psycho breakdown, they're so annoying.  I was told later that it was apparently supposed to create the effect of a comic book, but all it did for me was create the strong urge to smash the television like the big green guy himself.  Please Ang Lee, I'm begging you, don't ever do this again!!!!!<br /><br />So yeah, in case you haven't figured it out yet, I really didn't care much for this one. I'm really hoping that the sequel with Edward Norton is much better, although truthfully it couldn't possibly be worse.  I think I'd rather watch \\"Batman & Robin\\" ten times in a row than to subject myself to this again.  And that's really saying something.nt reason.

B000000H6D|5.0|Last year, I reviewed a Type O album on Halloween, and this year I might as well do it again.  Although I consider \\"October Rust\\" to be the quintessential Halloween album, you really can't go wrong with anything by Pete and Co. on this unholiest of days.  The older stuff has a bit more thrash/punk influence, residual from Pete's old band, Carnivore, but there's also plenty of epic gothy goodness, and of course the usual tongue in cheek humor.  With song titles like \\"Kill All the White People\\" and \\"We Hate Everyone\\", it's pretty obvious they don't take themselves too seriously.  There's also the crazy cover of Seals and Crofts' \\"Summer Breeze\\" that really has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />So anyway, Happy Halloween to all, and remember, don't mistake lack of talent for genius. ;)
B000ULQV0W|5.0|The lyrics and musical accompanyment in this cd will absolutely grab anyone who is a wanderer. It almost seems that Eddie Vedder gets into McCandless's mind and sings it out for all of us to hear. Some of the lyrics in the songs just stick out and stay with you forever:    \\" gonna rise up/ find my direction magnetically.\\"    \\" all my destinations will accept the one thats me/ so i can breathe \\"    \\" I knew all the rules but the rules did not know me, GUARANTEED \\"    so many to think of that are so quotable. AMAZING buy. more like an investment in my opinion.
0060920084|5.0|In keepin' with some 'o the otha remarks on this hear review page, I'd jus' like ta say that Mr. Bill Bryson is condasendin' of 'Merica, condasendin' of 'Merican values, and - above all - condasendin' of 'Merican small towns and the fine folk and farm animals who inhibit them. How he could live on some depressin', foggy lil' island like England (which we dun saved durin' WWII and protected during the Cold War, lessin' it become some Soviet satellite) for two whole decades and then return to the good ol' US of A and NOT APPRECIATE the value of strip malls. clogged highways, and fried chicken joints is beyond me. This book may be funny to them there thinkin' folks, but what Mr. Bryson's got to realize is that thinkin' folks like him is the overwhelming minority, and to that I say good riddance. An' heck, if someone actually listened to his whinin' and criticizin', then 'Merica might actually start changin'; it might start listenin' to the people, and imagine what where that might lead. The glasses in England may be half empty Mr. Bryson (and I reckon they's plenty smudgy, too), but the ones hear in the Land of the Free are ALWAYS half full. So, why don't you saddle on up and ride on back across the Pacific to yer' beloved Britain. What's that? You did? Well, good!<br /><br />PS: I really enjoyed your 'A Short History of Nearly Everything.' 'Mother Tongue' was enlightening too.<br /><br />Billy-Joe Barndoor, author
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I will start off by saying that I am what people can call a pretty big A7X fan so my review may seem a little biased. But, I really do NOT view this album as terrible like it seems a lot of reviewers want to say about it. I will however support the fact that there are definitely some weak points such as the song \\"Scream,\\" which is probably the worst song they have ever made. The music in it isn't bad but it's also not good enough to make up for the god awful lyrics that I personally consider to be embarrassing (You know I wanna make you scream, you know i wanna make you run from me baby??). Another weak point is that this album, although has some, lacks the metal side of Avenged that I loved. I did kind of see that coming, but what I was expecting out of this album was far worse than what they actually brought to the table. There are many songs that portray their epic value (in all shapes and sizes). \\"Afterlife,\\" \\"Unbound,\\" and \\"Lost\\" are examples of that. The single \\"Almost Easy\\" is a song that grew on me for what it's worth. It's a song I can tell they probably felt pressured to make from the record company but in my opinion they did it right. They have also toned down the guitar solos a little but the solos that are on this disc are incredibly fast and harmonious. \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" is the longest song on this album and it is quite impressive, experimental, and VERY different for Avenged. The song is very well composed and they're looking forward more and more as their career progresses. This is not nearly a disappointment as I thought it could've been and I really cannot say I have any idea what will spawn next from these guys who obviously take their music very seriously in the concept of surprising and writing in general, as well as restraining themselves. All around good album with a few weak points but, A7X is still one of my favorite bands!
B000TUXL2A|2.0|Love Knopfler but this is a little too slow. Slow is okay but it also seems to be missing the classic Knopfler hooks we've all come to expect. It's not a turn off but it's not the first recording to be recommended to someone who's never heard him

0807262013|5.0|The reviews that include reference to the STRONG anti-Catholic sentiment of this series - is not off. As a Catholic - I have to say - I was surprised and slightly disappointed by its strong message (particularly in this book). However, luckily - I can think for myself and look past this - because the series is highly imaginative, extremely well written, and a fascinating mix of science and fantasy - coupled with some real-world political issues surrounding heavy corruption and consequences of actions. I am not sure how I feel about the book being a children's series - because, to me - it's undertones are so strong - that any family trying to build faith in their young people must be prepared to explain A LOT. I give this book - and the series full stars because the characters are so strong, the narrative is GREAT, and the plot is carefully thought out, There are also some very strong, and POSITIVE themes involved - like trust, courage, love, and responsibility - however, I won't let my kiddos read this until I am prepared to explain things to them in a way they will understand. Don't get me wrong - I loved this series - however, I will most certainly only let my children read with my close supervision and commentary. As good a story as it is - I can't let everything we've worked for in our faith be compromised.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|While having more advanced Special Effects, it is not as true to the original H.G.Wells story vision as the ORIGINAL (Rod Taylor) The Time Machine.
B000OCZD60|5.0|By far the best presentation of Road Warrior yet. The panoramic shots of the Australian outback never looked so good. The cinematography really takes advantage of widescreen, even in the action shots, so it is perfect for HD. And it is an excellent HD transfer as well. The digital surround sound is also great on my stereo system, despite what some of the other reviews said.    I probably would have rated it 4.5 stars since there are so few extras, but I did not want to give people the impression that the movie, transfer, or presentation in HD format is not excellent by rating it just 4 stars. Without doubt this is a great HD-DVD, I would just like more on the disk.

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|Don't call it a comeback. Call it a cash-in. Call it expected. Call it absurd. Just don't call it a comeback. When Britney first arrived on the scene nearly a decade ago, she had two main audiences: the prepubescent girl and the creepy old guy. But now Britney's much too raunchy for the younger audience and she's already given the old guys more than a glimpse of pretty much everything imaginable. Those who were fans have largely grown up or grown out of her. So you have to ask yourself, why does this album even exist? \\"Blackout\\" is the kind of album that exists for two purposes; to line the wallets of record executives and to boost the ego of Ms. Spears. The point of this album is not to give fans of Britney some new material, but to capitalize on the recent explosion of Britney in the tabloids and celebrity news media. Anyone who can't see that is probably the type of person that would buy this garbage.<br /><br />\\"It's Britney, B****!\\" That's how she chooses to start the album, and my immediate response is, \\"I wish it wasn't.\\" \\"Gimme More\\" has been a pretty big success for Britney, getting her the highest on the charts that she's been since \\"Hit Me Baby, One More Time\\" believe it or not. For what it's worth, it is the strongest song on \\"Blackout\\" and probably the only one that should actually exist. The production here is great, as it is through most of the album. Unfortunately for Britney, however, is the fact that the coolest part of the song are the pitch-shifted \\"mores\\" that follow her redundant \\"Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimmes.\\"<br /><br />Despite the production being through the roof, it's also the album's biggest flaw. Britney's voice (which has never been her strong point) doesn't even sound like itself half the time. Every trick that you could possibly come up with to disguise the fact that Britney can't carry a tune is employed here in the hopes that we won't actually notice. According to one critic, \\"In terms of studio trickery, Paris Hilton's album was practically 'unplugged' compared to this.\\" Never is this more evident than on the song \\"Radar\\" where Britney sounds more like a robot than a human being. It's absolutely ridiculous!<br /><br />Also ridiculous is Britney's insistence that she's still America's sweet, little seductress rather than America's punchline. She spends the majority of the album trying to sound sexy and convince us that she's so with such lines as: \\"If I get on top, you're gonna lose your mind,\\" \\"Coming back looking delicious, yes I know they wanna kiss me,\\" \\"I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy, Make him call me \\"mama,\\" make him my new baby\\" \\"I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside,\\" or my personal favorite, \\"Baby I'm just hot for taking, don't you wanna see my body naked?\\" (Chances are, he probably already has Brit Brit). All this stuff might have been sexy 4 or 5 years ago, but after seeing Britney in every bad scenario possible, these lyrics are a joke! Every time I start to think that she sounds sexy, I have an image of a coked-out bald woman beating the hell out of a car with an umbrella, or a mentally unstable girl who can't keep her kids in her custody for more than a few hours and whose idea of a comeback is casually walking around on a stage lip-syncing in underwear on national television. Granted, Britney doesn't do much on this album besides provide vocals (she's only credited on two songs for co-writing), but you'd think someone who's been in the business as long as she has would have the good sense to know that the majority of the lyrics on \\"Blackout\\" are laughable. At one point, Britney's singing \\"I fall off the edge of my mind...\\" over and over again. What the hell does this even mean? Does anyone know?<br /><br />In the end, \\"Blackout\\" is a misguided, rushed, and ultimately botched attempt at a comeback from an artist that desperately need to take her time making an album that wouldn't be added to her growing list of bad decisions. After all hertime in the spotlight, what I wanted to hear most from Britney was something real, something personal that goes deeper than the stupid and overused \\"bump 'n' grind\\" lyrics that fill this album. \\"Blackout\\" just screams of a rushed job and in the ends, it fails as anything other than a mindless collection of songs with maybe one or two songs that you could dance to in a club. The production is incredible, and if they ever release an instrumental version of \\"Blackout,\\" I might recommend it to someone. But as it stands, \\"Blackout\\" is nothing more than a blip on my radar that I'll forget about tomorrow. And for those who may think I've devoted too much time dwelling on Britney's personal life, take a moment to realize that this album exists for the sole pupose on capitalizing on her escapades, and maybe you'll be able to forgive me.  If the RIAA wonders why people download music illegally these days, look no further than this album. The American public is smart, and we know what good music sounds like. This ain't it! \\"Blackout\\" is a collection of mediocre songs, shoveled onto a CD in the hopes of making a quick buck on the tabloid adventures of Britney Spears. No more, no less.<br /><br />Recommended for the mindless, and anyone who wants to give Britney the resources needed to continue her depraved lifestyle.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Gimme More\\"<br />2. \\"Hot as Ice\\"<br /><br />3 out of 10 Starsanted to hear most from Britney was something real, something personal that goes deeper than the stupid and overused \\"bump 'n' grind\\" lyrics that fill this album. \\"Blackout\\" just screams of a rushed job and in the ends, it fails as anything other than a mindless collection of songs with maybe one or two songs that you could dance to in a club.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I gotta say that I am not a Britney fan, or at least I wasn't.  Her latest offering 'Blackout' is by far one of the most experimental & enjoyable experiences to come out in the last few years from anyone, period.  This record really doesn't fall under pop, it's more electronica then anything.  If you like house, tech-house, booty house or anything in between you will not be disappointed.  Put aside her personal life and look at the music for what it is, infectious, experimental, and just great.  This record will be blowing up in the clubs for years to come, it's ahead of it's time GO BUY IT!
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I honestly am dumbfounded so many people think this can be a 4 or 5 star album.  Have people listened to it?  Have they heard Britney can't hold a note, her voice is raspy or that you can barely understand what she is saying?  Sure there are some good beats behind the music but that has nothing to do with her.  Her singing is horrible. I would have to think 90% of these reviews are from kids under the age of 16 that don't appreciate good singing anyway.  Please go onto MSN and listen to the whole album and then decide.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|From the tear-jerking premiere to the virtually perfect season finale, Season Two of \\"Supernatural\\" once again demonstrates how much better genre shows get in their second seasons.  Take a look at \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" a show which, by the way, has a heavy influence on this wonderful series.  BtVS, like \\"Supernatural,\\" had humble beginnings, but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season.  \\"Supernatural\\" does the very same.    Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here.  Dean and Sam's relationship has become layered and, as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers, becomes the dramatic center of the show.  Replacing the \\"monster of the week\\" format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season.  Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season.  If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty, get this.  The mythology is expanded and strengthened.  The black and white, good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we're all so interested in.  The comedy--again, very Buffy-esque--is amped up, including many laugh-out-loud moments.  The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.    All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale, which is--as I mentioned above--a moment of television perfection.  I haven't been so euphoric about serialized television since the moment Joss Whedon's [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel - Complete Series Collector's Set]] came to an end in 2004.    Along with [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes - Season One]] and [[ASIN:B000NA2BEU Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season]], the second chapter in Dean and Sam's journey was among the best of the Fall 06-Spring 07 television season.    9/10
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Not a bad song on the cd, although some songs are stronger than others. Some of my favs: Gimme More, Piece of Me, Freakshow, & Hot As Ice. Glad I bought it!
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Beautifully restored Disney classic.  The last great animated film of Disney's old school animators. When animation took the turn to more CGI I grimmaced.  Illustrated in a loose style with a sketchy feel, the animators infused far more life than a sterile computer graphic modelling.  These artists could really draw.  With incredible voice talent of New Orleans' Phil Harris and Louie Prima, this movie is so jazzy and cool that you become addicted to their style of lingo and banter. Just like being in New Orleans French Quarter!  This two disk set is curiously missing the theatrical trailer(s) while they managed to put in an extraneous music video.  Who really cares about these young kids singing a Jungle Book updated (gasp) song.  I don't.  So as a collector I felt somewhat slighted when the theatrical trailer and any promotional material was absent.  I guess Disney will go to the old cash cow once again for a SUPER DUPER PLATINUM GOLD EDITION and include all promotional materials then.  How shrewd!  Disney should start releasing older films to dvd and preserve them for posterity, titles like \\"Dr. Syn Alias The Scarecrow (of Rominey Marsh).\\"
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Just picked this 3 disc set up at best Buy, a week earlier than stated release date, It includes a bonus disc from Chicago '79. Will post review after I view it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This video is stupendous.  If you like the guitar work of David Gilmour, then this is as good as it gets.  Excellent close up footage of a master in his element.  Highest possible recommendation!
0340839937|5.0|I have read the Dune trilogy for the first time as a very young adult, and it made a very large impact. It opened up a complete new world to my already over-active imagination.<br /><br />The Dune Universe, is anything but simple or easily digestable: filled with dark and soul tortured characters in a highly political structure, with creatures, technological and ecological ideas that can only come from a genius - The Dune trilogy is simply a masterpiece, and not just in the Science Fiction genre...
0688152023|5.0|To everyone I wish could be more explicit but english is not my primary language. This book is Excellent.
1400079276|5.0|Not everyone's cup of tea, but Kafka on the Shore is a magical read: taking the reader on quite a strange and enchanting journey, filled with rich and engaging characters that makes one look within as well.<br /><br />Wonderful read for those who like something different.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This super set of songs is what a band that has helped define the classic rock sound should aspire to. It remains a classic sound and it rocks! This music deals with a life lived, matured. It's the same ol' guys, but with a ton more experience (wisdom?). For once experience seems to actually elevate the quality of the songs - this isn't a tired retread of yesterday. Mostly it is great Eagles rock 'n' roll for 2007. Henley's voice is incredible, the harmonies and vibes are awesome. While these guys are not defining new territory on the rock scene, they are certainly laying claim to what is the best of the rock/folk/country music nexus - and the Eagles now own it outright with this effort. Buy it - enjoy it - I sure have!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Once again Bruce shows his gift of poetry with words and music.He can make everyday thoughts and actions into thought provoking experiences. If you   don't want to go down that road,  there is just great music filled with  driving energy and Bruce's passionate filled vocal and guitar talent.
B000VR824S|4.0|This show was amazing in person (after a 12 hour drive!) and the entire thing was available streaming video for a few days after(all 11 hours) but for some reason this is VERY edited. That said, this is really the best of the day crammed into 3 or 4 hours. I wish more of Robert Cray, Jeff Beck and Los Lobos was included. Esp, Beck's A Day In The Life, which was a show highlight.    Looks like almost all of Windwoods set and a good dose of Claptons is included.    So you SHOULD have been there, but this is cool too!
B000VL9XNI|5.0|I had one hell of a hard time obtaining this 3-disc version, but it was well worth the effort.     First of all, for those out there who think that the \\"special-edition\\" 3rd disc is 20 minutes of stuff you've seen a million times that they slapped on so they could charge more, well, think again. Disc 3 is 2 HOURS of bonus live performances. The equivalent of an entire AC/DC show for your viewing pleasure.    I won't go into the details of every song on this incredible set as there is a list with the item listing. The first disc covers the Bon years for more than 2 hours. The second disc covers the Brian years for more than 2 hours. Disc 3 covers both eras for an additional 2 hours+! So we're talking around 7 hours of live AC/DC covering 30 years of history! Wow!    This set is amazing! With great animated menus with an animated seedy bar/video game backdrop to an Angus video game playing while you're checking out menu options to a cartoon Angus hopping about while each clip loads. It's clear to see that a lot of work went into the package as well. This special-edition includes a full-color booklet, an envelope stuffed with replica badges, ads, stickers and passes from various tours and so on. Even the box when, held up to the light, reflects memorabilia from a history of touring.     There have been those who have complained about the video and sound quality. I don't have a problem with these aspects. Of course improved/remastered picture and sound are always nice, but I think the idea here was to present the material as it happened. A lot of these live clips were for TV/promotion in Europe and I'm fairly certain the idea was to show it to new viewers the way folks saw it back then.     Plug Me In is an historical timepiece charting the rise of, in my opinion, the greatest rock band of all time. Seeing Bon, Angus and co. belting it out in a HIGH SCHOOL GYM! in the early days in grainy, poorly shot black and white on Disc One to their most recent gig in front of 200,000 people in Toronto shot with multiple cameras and so on is a testament to how hard and how long this band worked to get where it is today. That's the point of this set, to show fans the journey from novelty/small time act to Hall Of Fame inductees.     The music is great! And there are a lot of tunes fans just don't here live anymore. Gone Shootin' has always been my favorite and it's on here twice! The performance of Ride On during the last tour was moving as Brian introduces it as \\"a Bon Scott song\\" -- something he never does with the other Bon material. The personal, foreshadowing lyrics and the fact that it is performed in Paris where the Let There Be Rock movie was filmed back in 1979 (just prior to Bon's death) make it one of the highlights of the set.     If you're a fan of AC/DC, this set will not disappoint. Although I recommend the 3-disc version highly, the 2-disc contains most of the material. But if you want it all, go with the 3-disc. A great collection from the greatest rock band around! How can you lose?
B0000042MY|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Never get tired of it.  And now I have the music - lovely.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Oh My!!! This is HOT!! Love this CD! Great job Britney! Im glad something is going right for you. Hang in there, time will pass and you will come out on top!! Not a super fan, but someone who has been where you are and I'm in your corner and loving this CD. Cant say there is one track I dont like.
0316010669|4.0|I was very impressed with this book. I think the basic concept that comes through is that we as people have an innate ability to discern that goes beyond normal logic and analysis. The author presents some interesting studies that show how different people have honed that ability in specific areas to be able to make decisions in what may be called the Blink of an eye. It's that quick. The author often refers to this ability as thin-slicing.<br /><br />I think what many reviewers here may have missed because of there own expectations or what may even be an example that fits in with some of the studies discussed in the book is a psychological background that includes the understanding of the buffers and filters that are instilled in every individual as they grow up and are exposed to the stresses of life.<br /><br />The topic of the book isn't just about going with your gut feeling as I read one of the reviews here mention. Nor is it as simple as trusting your instincts. We all have polluted reading instruments that distort our perceptions. As the author explains in one study, gut reaction can lead to someone's death when we are psychologically distorted ourselves.<br /><br />The trick seems to be in cleansing our reading apparatus in such contexts where we may need this ability to operate on our behalf. Some of the studies where this ability was shown to manifest required people to train themselves by identifying what the actual pertinent data was in the given situation and after repeated exposure to the situations, discerning correctly became second nature. In other studies Gladwell shows that strangers can correctly discern many things about people they do not know by simply looking at the environment in which they live.<br /><br />It is discouraging to me to realize how messed up we are psychologically, how all the buffers, filters, programs we have built in ourselves psychologically stifles this ability to thin slice.<br /><br />It am encouraged to read about all the examples and studies that show we have this ability within us and the possibility that perhaps it can be regained and that we can once again listen to what we already know in some sense.we have this ability within us and the possibility that perhaps it can be regained and that we can once again listen to what we already know in some sense.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold is evolving. This is a given. The thing that I loved most about this album was the fact that they've very much broken out of the norm, and placed quite a bit of originality here. The band has almost turned from a heavy metal/metalcore band to a progressive rock band, and I love it. This will definitely piss some fans off, but who cares. No band stays the same. Of course, there are a few heavy tracks here, reminescent of their older stuff, but honestly, I'd rather listen to their more innovative material. It's very interesting, and even powerful at times. Take the song \\"A little piece of heaven\\" for example. There are so few bands who pull off songs that are so inventive. The album is very eclectic, and unique to what everybody else is doing. I simply must give it props for that. In this case, the songs that sounded like their trademark heavy songs are the ones that I really don't care for. Another thing I loved about this album was the theatrical feel. City of Evil came close to this in some parts, but the added orcheastration here is great. There were definitely apects of their other albums that were better than this, but then again, there's aspects of this that are much better, including the fact that the band is discovering and experimenting with new ideas, and applying them on a higher level. I don't really care if it's not \\"metal\\" enough, I just think it's cool that they didn't restrict themselves to that genre alone.  I think it's a very good album overall, and very eclectic and unique, yet they still definitely stay true to their own style and sound. Rock needs more of this.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I've read the book twice and our family sat down to watch this DVD together. Once again, Al Gore's story moves me. Even though I already know about the changes that had happened during the last few decades around the globe, the visual effects of these data create a deeper impression. The DVD feels more personal than the book, and it also helps that Gore is pretty funny sometimes, who knew?  Some people have argued about the accuracy or validity of the predictions, but whether or not you are convinced of the data or not, wouldn't it be worthwhile to try to do the right thing? Just as the movie suggested, everybody can do their share to make earth a better place to live. I will share this DVD with as many friends as possible. For the past year or two, we've tried to use enery efficient appliances and light bulbs. I am even getting better at recycling, which was my shortcoming before. We try to participate in CSA - community supported agriculture, buy fair-trade and organic products if possible, look into hybrid cars (-too bad there aren't many lease options for these), and take public transportations when realistic, and teach kids to be environmentally conscious.   I am glad to see more than one thousand reviews here and venture to say that millions are taking actions, big and small. With the book, this DVD, the Oscar and the Nobel prize, ...Al Gore's continued seminars and his refusal to be a presidential candidate this time around..., I think the message will reach tipping point, soon.
0743289684|3.0|I bought this book after watching some YouTube videos of Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  She is a remarkable woman!  I am a huge fan.  However, the book was not what I was expecting.  It's just an autobiography - it's not very detailed about how she came to reject Islam and become an atheist.  I almost get the feeling she is saying she became an atheist because Islam just didn't suit her personality, not because she proved to herself that it was false.  So, five stars, always, for the brilliance, bravery, and individualism of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but three stars for this particular book.  (Maybe I'll check out The Caged Virgin.  It might be more what I was expecting.)

B000WAEJZ0|4.0|While the past several years, the hype has been about more of the bad girls like the sleezy Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears, we often really do forget about what has made our influences really shine, and that is just simply the voice. That is sadly the case as well with Whitney Houston. This past couple of years has been difficult for her, with the heartbreaking divorce of her ex-husband, Bobby Brown, and the tabloid fallout over her her personal problems, she is still coming back on solid ground, and her voice is still a knockout. But, in the U.S., there hasn't been a definitive hits album that has shown Whitney at her peaks. While the 2000 The Greatest Hits, had missed out on a lot of tracks, by choosing to make remixes come alive of most of her great songs, instead of the original editions, but the overseas version delivered better by not overdoing it on the remixes. Now, another chance has come around to bring this legendary voice back to a new era and the hearts of those who will still always love her.<br /><br />The 2007 Whitney Houston: Ultimate Collection is a single disc retrospective of Whitney Houston at her best. The collection includes 18 of her great tracks that are definitely most of the best, but also does the trick mostly well, at re-introducing her sophisticated voice to a new generation. The collection includes her big #1 smashes including the definitive I Will Always Love You, One Moment In Time, her anthem for the 1988 Summer Olympics, as well as classics like Saving All My Love For You, The Greatest Love Of All, and and Exhale (Shoop Shoop) from Waiting To Exhale. The album also includes the overlooked When You Believe, her Oscar-winning duet with Mariah Carey from The Prince Of Egypt, which was overshadowed from her previous hits album. Surprisingly, there were a few great tracks that were sadly overlooked on this album including her breakout hit You Give Good Love, Heartbreak Hotel, I Believe In You & Me and Step By Step from The Preacher's Wife, All The Man That I Need, and One Of Those Days from her last album, Just Whitney.<br /><br />Although Whitney Houston: The Ultimate Collection did overlook a few great songs, it stayed true and relevant at delivering a simple greatest hits album than the 2000 one, by trimming the dance beats, and staying true to just the simplicity of Whitney Houston's voice. While more of the hype right now is on acts like Britney Spears and her so-called comeback Blackout, Beyonce' and Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston's songs stand strong with the testiments of time, and this hits album does basically show that well.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1) I Will Always Love You<br />2) Saving All My Love For You<br />3) Greatest Love Of All<br />4) I Wanna Dance With Somebody<br />5) One Moment In Time<br />6) How Will I Know<br />7) So Emotional<br />8) When You Believe<br />9) Where Do Broken Hearts Go<br />10) I'm Your Baby Tonight<br />11) Didn't We Almost Have It All<br />12) Run To You<br />13) Exhale (Shoop Shoop)<br />14) If I Told You That<br />15) I Have Nothing<br />16) I'm Every Woman<br />17) Its Not Right, But Its Okay<br />18) My Love Is Your Love<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-her's Wife, All The Man That I Need, and One Of Those Days from her last album, Just Whitney.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|Being a former school bus driver, I thought the movie title was very deceptive. I didnt know what to expect from this movie.  The movie has nothing to do with a bus! It refers to a shortbus, which I felt means, misfits, and outcasts of society, etc. The movie starts of very slowly but picks up momentum later on.  This movie is full of sexual encounters, which show full nudity and sex acts.  Even though they try to depict \\"The Lifestyle\\", I feel they fell short. I am not naiive, but I know lots of that promiscuous sex goes on between heterosexuals and homosexuals.  The movie touches on all of these lifestyles. This is not a movie you would want to invite a bunch of friends over to see. At least that is my opinion.

0895260131|1.0|The first half of the book is devoted to Spencer's usual rants against Islamic history, culture and religion. Most of what is written here has already been covered in Spencer's other books. Basically he just cherrypicks quotes from the Qur'an and details from the life of Muhammad to present Islam in the most negative manner possible. Nothing especially new or insightful is presented and no effort towards scholarly objectivity is attempted. In fact, Spencer constantly ridicules respected religious scholars, such as Karen Armstrong and Bernard Lewis, as being Islamic apologists. The fact is that Spencer has no interest in depicting Islam in a balanced and truthful manner. But is clearly on an anti-Islamic \\"Christian Crusade\\" of his own.    But it is the second part of the book, devoted to Spencer's biased and ignorant analysis of the Crusades, that is the most disturbing and ridiculous. Here he basically attempts to make excuses for one of the most bloody and horrific eras in Christian history and even touts the Crusades as being a noble effort whose only fault was their lack of permanent success in conquering Muslim held territory in the Middle East for Christianity.     By the way, I am a secular Westerner who does recognize Islamic terroism as a serious problem and also is opposed to religious extremism and violence of any kind. It is here that I find Spencer to be such a blind and foolish hypocrite. His answer to Islamic violence is to defeat them with Christian violence, even calling one chapter \\"The Crusade We Must Fight Today\\". The truth is that Islamic fundamentalism is a right wing cultural and religious movement just as is Christian fundamentalism. They both call for the return to a \\"traditional society\\" based on conservative, religiously based values - illegal abortion, xenophobia, hatred of homosexuals, treating woman as second class citizens with men as the \\"head of household\\", etc. Spencer is even opposed to attempting to communicate and build relationships with moderate Muslims, instead seeing this as some sort of apocalyptic struggle to the death between the forces of \\"Good (Christianity)  and Evil (Islam).\\" This is a completely absurd perspective and serves no purpose beyond continued violence and warfare.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|NO doubt about it. This is BRITNEY'S most accomplished collection of recordings ever. It's hip, stylized, fresh and current. Do not be fooled by Britney's antics, she has proved with BLACKOUT that she can still stay relevant in the music industry and is a major force to be reckoned with. BRITNEY FANS (and HATERS) buy this album. Everyone can agree that Britney is the undisputed queen of pop, and this album proves it.     We'll see you at number one BRIT!
1401300529|5.0|The literary world lost one of its \\"best and brightest\\" when David Halberstam was killed in a car accident in April 2007. His final gift --- to established fans and potentially new ones --- is THE COLDEST WINTER, perhaps the most dramatic and damning accounts of the Korean War ever put to paper.    Halberstam, author of such classics as the powers that be and THE FIFTIES --- in addition to his well-received sports books including THE TEAMMATES, SUMMER OF '49 and THE BREAKS OF THE GAME --- will be remembered for his tireless devotion to detail and unvarnished reporting. Here, he continues these high standards.    In his introduction, Halberstam notes that during his research at one Florida library he found \\"some eighty-eight books on Vietnam [including, one assumes, his own THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST], and only four on Korea....When servicemen returned from their tours, they found their neighbors generally not very interested in what they had seen or done.\\"    \\"If American military history has shortchanged any of this country's wars in the past century,\\" he writes in a later chapter, \\"it is Korea.\\"    In 1950, few people even knew where this Far East nation was, much less what was at stake as the communist nations sought to extend their reach. And if they did know, they didn't much care; only five years removed from America's involvement in the latest war to end all wars, it was now becoming embroiled in another conflict.    The first part of THE COLDEST WINTER, which considers much of the back story to the War, is a bit plodding but nonetheless important and ultimately worthwhile as Halberstam sets the stage, describing the major and minor players such as Truman, Mao, Stalin and their supporting cast. He delves deeply into the lives of prominent American military leaders such as MacArthur, Walker and Almond. At times, the analyses --- such as how much family pressure MacArthur, the son of an admirable, if not outrageously successful, military man, had working for oragainst him (depending on one's point of view) --- seem way out of proportion to the overall history of the war.    If these mini-biographies appear overdone, patience will be rewarded by an understanding of these figures after Halberstam puts them \\"on the couch.\\" No general attains such high rank without a large sense of ambition. But instead of seeking a common goal, it seems that these leaders were more interested in personal advancement and glory than leading their troops to victory for the sake of their nation. The reader will note with varying degrees of disappointment and/or disgust how petty many of these men were. Adjectives like \\"vainglorious,\\" \\"over-confident,\\" \\"ambitious\\" and \\"megalomania\\" flow freely. MacArthur often flew in the face of common sense: \\"Of the many professional sins of which [he] was guilty...including hubris and vanity, none was greater than his complete underestimating of his enemy.\\"    Halberstam even asserts that \\"MacArthur did not in fact know that much about Asia,\\" a statement that will no doubt surprise and shock those who have always been under the opposite impression, given his long tour of duty in Japan. But \\"Like Custer at the Little Big Horn [MacArthur] had neither eyes nor ears for information that might deter him from the swift attainment of his objective,\\" the destruction of the enemy.    The callousness over consequences was by no means limited to the American military. Halberstam reports how, when confronted by the possibility of a nuclear strike, Mao responded, \\"China has millions of people....The death of ten or twenty million...is nothing to be afraid of.\\"    Aside from the martial considerations were the politics at home. War is not just fought on battlefields; it is carried out at home by politicians as well. Truman, an underappreciated president at the time (MacArthur deemed him inferior, but then he felt that way about everyone. His underassessment of the abilities of the Korean and Chinese armed forces was a major shortcoming in American and allied tactics), had to deal with his own party leaders, worried about their own jobs and the survival of the Democratic ideals. Republicans, on the other hand, had a field day with his difficulties.    Of necessity, the more dramatic theme is the life-and-death struggle of the average soldier during the autumn and early winter of 1950, and Halberstam does an excellent job of recreating the abject fear and desperation with which these men had to carry out their jobs --- jobs made more difficult by the horrific cold and terrain for which they were ill-prepared, both in terms of equipment and proper leadership. His interviews with these veterans are heartbreaking and infuriating. This is not to say, however, that there are not heroes in THE COLDEST WINTER. Halberstam pays tribute to generals like Walton \\"Johnny\\" Walker and Matt Ridgway, as well as the junior officers who tried their best under impossible situations until major victories at Wonju and Cipyongni turned the tide, which in this case means bringing things to a stalemate. Korea was the first war that did not end in victory for the U.S., a prelude of military involvements to come.    In the end, these long-forgotten stories of the \\"G.I. Joe\\" make for a grand \\"final chapter\\" in Halberstam's distinguished opus.        --- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan
0553804367|5.0|I think this book is as close as anyone will come to make quantum mechanics an easy subject. That is why I gave it 5 stars.    That being said, I only have a marginal increase of my understanding of the subject after reading the book.     I guess it is true that : \\"If you say that you understand quantum mechanics, and if you are NOT surprised, then you really did not understand quantum mechanics\\" !
6305327041|5.0|While each room was directed by a seperate director, all fit together quite nicely.  Tim Roth gives an absolutely hilarious performance.  This film is especially funny if you watch it soon after watching Tim Roth in \\"Rob Roy\\", so that you can enjoy watching Ted the Bellhop's mishaps with that much more personal joy.<br /><br />You will laugh well beyond the point that it hurts.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Sometimes these duet albums have the tendency to really tank. You know what I mean...in that they end up having none of the traits that you like about either artist, and the combination of the two degrades into a musically compromised compost pile.     THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE!     Knopfler and Harris make a fantastic combination, and their musical strengths compliment each other fabulously. I highly recommend this CD if you are a Knopfler or Harris fan.     I hope they consider working together in the future.

B000Y179KO|4.0|It's been a long time coming, but it is worth it. The Eagles are probably one of the most popular bands of all time, that is not sitting on top of 20 or 30 albums. Unlike other bands this group releases only the finest music when it is time to do so. Sorry 5 stars are reserved for all Beatle music. But this is a top 4+. Some people will call it country and that's ok, since the new age country is borderline rock anyway. Call it what U want, just buy it and enjoy.
B000M06K5C|5.0|When I first heard Silent Alarm, I thought this is my favorite new band.  They are completly original and smart.  Then I heard...A Weekend in the City and I was positive that this was my favorite new band.   They have a real rock sound with a dancable beat, and are perfect when in the car.   I play this Cd all the time and everytime someone asks what is that you are listen to...it sounds so different and cool.   I have shared this album with many others and they are believers too.   Bloc Party have a edge that most bands don't today....they do their own thing and don't worry about what is hip or cool, this in turn makes them utterly cool and brilliant.   They have the ability to be angry, sad, and happy all at the same time.   Awesome.

I own every album, listen to something of Zeppelin at least once a day, and I am telling you this is terrible. The film is a waste of time. I've seen it once. Nothing special. Get the two disc DVD of their concerts that came out a few years ago. That is something to ooohhh and aawww over. Not this. If you are buying this for the music...don't. Its worth spending more money to buy all of their albums than to waste some on this.     hope this was helpful.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I must be a bit crazy because watching Twin Peaks is always an emotional experience for me. I get misty-eyed at the oddest moments. Maybe memories are triggered from 1990 when the show first aired and how my friends and I would routinely convene at a coffee shop or diner late at night and recount our theories and revelations about that week's particular episode or maybe I'm reminded of how those same friends dropped out of watching Twin Peaks somewhere in the middle of season two and I felt I was the last person on earth carrying the torch. Regardless, this is simply the quirkiest and most dreamlike television series ever created and even in today's landscape of made-for-cable shows that \\"push the envelope\\", nothing....and I mean....NOTHING can touch Twin Peaks.  With this set you get the entire series and the long awaited original pilot episode along with a slew of extras. Keep in mind that you'll have to hold on to those seperate seasons 1 and 2 box sets because many of the special features on those sets are not repeated here.  For those new to the series: The first season is worthy of all the praise heaped on it back in 1990. In fact much of Twin Peaks' reputation rests on those early episodes. Season two suffers from the quick resolution of Laura Palmer's murder and a scrapped plotline about Dale Cooper and Audrey Horne (a romance that viewers were certainly expecting give the direction the show was going in and, in my opinion, a missed opportunity that could have saved the series). Things get back on track by the end of season two and the season finale might just be the weirdest thing to ever air on TV.  As other reviewers have mentioned the documentaries here are top notch (it's fun to watch David Lynch turn to jelly at the mere presence of Madchen Amick) and both Lynch and Mark Frost lament being pressured by ABC to solve Laura Palmer's murder. The mystery of Laura Palmer was the bait that kept viewers interested. Revenge is sweet, however, because it just might be the last episode of the show, with it's horrifying unresolved plot twist, that has kept faithful fans enthralled with the world of Twin Peaks ever since and leaves them wondering \\"what happens next?\\". We'll never know...but we can dream.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|It's tough to get past the first few minutes of this Perfume: Story of a Murderer, given the images of the seamy side of 18th century Paris and its denizens (human, animal and insect).  But in the overall scheme of things, those discomfiting sights are necessary to give you a sense of the supernormal sense of smell that the protagonist, Jean-Baptist Grenouille possesses.<br /><br />From the moment of his unfortunate birth under a fishmonger's table this is a tale of the full spectrum of scents, from horrid to euphoric.  Ben Whishaw plays the role of a boy abused by his world, who grows into a talented perfumer that pursues a horrific quest for the perfect scent.  Make no mistake, he's a monster, but his story is far more compelling than that you'll find in any Saw-like slasher porn.  This is a man capable of tracking a scent to it's source even through a squalid city.<br /><br />As a quasi-slave working in a tannery, Grenouille discovers his passion when he encounters Guiseppe Baldini, a master perfumer past his prime deftly played by Dustin Hoffman.  He demonstrates his innate ability by duplicating a scent for Baldini simply by finding the various components and deftly mixing them to perfection.  Baldini quickly realizes that his new apprentice is capable of returning his shoppe to the limelight and undertakes to educate him in the craft of perfuming, and Grenouille's obsession (no pun intended here at all) grows into sociopathic proportions.<br /><br />After learning what Baldini can teach him, he moves on to the city of Grasse, famed for it's method of enfleurage perfuming, where he learns more and his gruesome quest accelerates.  He decides that the way to create the perfect perfume is to capture the essence of 13 beautiful women.  When his first attempt with a prostitute encounters a little difficulty (she's more than creeped out at his style) he resolves that his victims must be killed first, in a manner that does not overly alarm them (think ambush from the back).<br /><br />Whishaw is capable in the lead role, however the movie is raised a notch by the performances of Hoffman and a few others.  Rachel Hurd-Wood is luminescent as his final target, easily giving you the impression that she possesses an essence of rare power (okay, that's a little over the top, but the whole theme is a little beyond the realm anyway).  And Alan Rickman is as solid as he always is as her protective father, a man capable of CSI-like analysis.  Finally, John Hurt lends his voice to that of the narrator, an often overlooked role that all too often gets in the way of a story but here it's necessary.<br /><br />It's gruesome in the extreme, and there is a fair amount of nudity (much of it post-mortem), but the story is absorbing beyond what your delicate sensibilities might suspect.able in the lead role, however the movie is raised a notch by the performances of Hoffman and a few others.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|There is a scene in the movie \\"Contact\\" where Jodie Foster is staring out the window of an alien space craft.  Below her she sees the unspeakable beauty of the Universe and says \\"There are no words... they should have sent a poet\\".  That is the very feeling I had watching and listening to this DVD concert.  This concert is music for the soul, and music that stirs the memories of those of us who saw Pink Floyd, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, and David Bowie in live concerts.  For those who  did not see the live concerts, this is as close as you will ever get.  I'm sure that you will treasure this DVD if you buy it.<br /><br />  David Gilmour, now 61 years young, remains in a class with few, if any equals.  There are Rock Artists, Rock Stars, Rock Legends, and then there is David Gilmour.  It is hard to imagine that his performances just keep getting better as the years roll by.  David has a keen sense of putting together a terrific group of artists to perform Pink Floyd music.  His choices on this DVD concert could not have been better (well - with one exception.  I really did miss Nick Mason on drums).  If you enjoyed the group that Roger Waters put together on his \\"In The Flesh - Live\\" DVD, you will find the musicans on \\"Remember That Night\\" equal or better.<br /><br />  The special appearances of Graham Nash, David Crosby, and David Bowie is a memorable treat.  But, lets be honest here, it's all about the Pink Floyd sound, and it has never been better than on this DVD.  My one wish is that the next Pink Floyd DVD concert is a reunion of David, Roger, Rick, and Nick performing once again as the REAL Pink Floyd.  I'm sure that it would be the greatest Rock concert of all times from an unknown group that started as \\"Tea Set\\" over 43 years ago.  Who'd a thunk it?<br /><br />P.S.  God Bless the memory of Sid Barrett.  Shine on....

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears is back -- finally. We all know Britney is not the strongest vocalist when compared to Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey, but strong vocals is not what \\"Blackout\\" is about. \\"Blackout\\" is fresh, modern, and edgy. Synthesized vocals and phenomenal beats support the album's base. Every track on this album is hypnotically produced to create a sound that listeners and critics would expect to hear in 2020; it's incredible.     The songs on this album are all phenomenal. The album starts out with the chart-topping \\"Gimme More,\\" which is just a tease compared to the rest of the album. The second song, and reportedly the second single, is \\"Piece of Me,\\" a rock/dance/pop hit where Spears addresses her critics. She sings, \\"I'm Mrs. Bad Media Karma, another day another drama ... I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, I'm Mrs. 'Oh My God That Britney's Shameless.\\"' The album continues with pop/dance songs that are less than forgettable. They are just the opposite with beats that stick in listeners' heads for hours and hours. \\"Toy Soldier\\" is an energetic and tantalizing song produced by Danja, who worked with Justin Timberlake on his latest album. Britney refuses to hold back on this album especially during the mesmerizing, \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan).\\" She teases the listener asking, \\"What I gotta do to make you move my body?\\" and finishes it off with, \\"take it off, take it off, take it off.\\" Britney closes the album with the one and only ballad in the entire album. Britney's last and most personal song is \\"Why Should I Be Sad?\\" where she confronts her recent heartbreak, but refuses to let it take over her life. Britney shows that even with all the stress and struggles of life, she is not going to let any of it bother her. She plans to move on. A perfect ending for an unbelievable album.     It is not just the hardcore \\"Britney enthusiasts\\" that rave about this album. The Associated Press calls it, \\"... not only a very good album, it's her best work ever - atriumph, with not a bad song to be found on the 12 tracks.\\" The New York Times refers to the album as \\"incredible!\\" Entertainment Weekly gives it a \\"B+\\" The highest rating Britney has ever received from EW, and better than Justin Timberlake's \\"FutureSex/LovSounds.\\" Some reviews have been harsh, saying Britney \\"is not ready to release an album.\\" But forget about Britney's past mishaps and troubles, and listen to the album for what it is. If you have to -- forget it is Britney Spears completely, you will see that this album is extraordinary. It will have you dancing and singing along within the first listen.    ** DO NOT MISS: Piece of Me, Break the Ice, Get Naked(I Got A Plan), Freakshow, Toy Soldier, and Perfect Lover. Also don't miss \\"State of Grace.\\" (Search for it on YouTube) The song did not make it on the album, but it showcases Britney's real vocal talent.

B000VI04HK|4.0|This package is a good value with a DVD and 1.3 CD's for under $20 (what, R.E.M. doesn't have enough material from the past 25+ years to fill in the 2nd CD with extra tracks?)  Yeah, the DVD can be a little annoying visually with the quick cuts, but I probably wouldn't have even noticed if I hadn't made the minor mistake of reading all these reviews before watching it.  Anyway, R.E.M. has been one of my favorite bands since age 11 when I got Reckoning in 1984.  I grew pretty disinterested, to be honest, with the past few albums being so mellow.  This package does a lot to renew my interest.  The recent material is highlighted here and better live.  If you stopped buying their CD's around the late 90's like I suspect a lot of people did, this is a good way to get back into the band.  Favorite tracks so far:  Cuyahoga, Electron Blue, Leaving New York.

The trilogy as a whole is awesome, and the price can't be beat.     Don't get a bunch of extra expensive editions of Spider-Man 3. There's no deleted scenes, so there's no hope of seeing what Venom bits were not included. If you're like me, and waited until now to buy these films, ow is the chance.

Listen to Gimme More, Piece of Me, and Radar: Blackout's highlight tracks, which by the way are just the first three tracks! If you aren't shaking it or nodding your head to the beats given to you, you're brain dead or not getting it. The smooth and synthesized sound sparkles and bubbles like a bottle of crystal. The repetiveness some may find annoying works for the electronic sound. It is exactly want was needed for the Queen of Teen Beat and Pop.<br /><br />Blackout delivers. Britney delivers. The work of the producers and writers certainly delivers. The power and appeal can not be fought. Just give in and buy it already.<br /><br />In the meantime, keeping pulling for Britney.

Most of the tracks are upbeat, however, she does have some tracks with substance.  \\"Piece of Me\\" and \\"Why should I be sad\\" is where Britney gives the big F*@$ YOU to the people scrutiny she has received in the past years.

B000TX7B5U|5.0|As an interested but not quite obsessive fan of System of a Down, I've been dying to hear Serj Tankian get the chance to explore his own vision. I have long been extremely fascinated by Serj's unique vocal talents, and I was not happy at all with the last two SOAD albums, in which Serj was demoted to a part-time employee of Daron Malakian. But perhaps I have underestimated Serj's contributions to the band, because this solo album features advancements in the best aspects of the SOAD sound, from the bludgeoning aggro riffs to the vertiginous timing changes to the violent mood swings. Even better, this album could be seriously viewed as an improvement on SOAD, rather than just a solo side project, because by applying his own complex muse Serj has made the sound more personable and immediate.<br /><br />There are some true musical advancements on this album, which will put to rest any doubts about the primacy of Serj's talents. Most noteworthy are the highly unusual art-metal contortions of \\"Honking Antelope\\" and \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,\\" not to mention snippets of very believable piano-driven balladry sprinkled throughout the album (usually employed as introductions or codas for more aggressive songs). And regardless of the great musical achievements here, Serj's voice is the reason for this album's existence, and he effortlessly carries each song with his diverse stylistic changes, somber to frantic delivery, and curve-ball phrasing. In just a few examples of Serj's impressive vocal acrobatics, check out his almost teary balladic singing in \\"Saving Us,\\" lightning-speed scatting in \\"Praise the Lord...\\" and bullying metallic chants in \\"The Unthinking Majority.\\" This album is a relentlessly fascinating display from a unique talent, and a showcase for one of the best singers on the scene today.

1594489505|5.0|A THousand Splendid Suns is one of my favorite books of all times.  It is well written.  Good character development, excellent desciptions, and plot development.  I could not put it down. It is a facinating glimps of a different culture.
B0000T6JH4|4.0|I've given it four stars because no album with these songs on it could score lower, but in the context of the Beatles history, it was a mistake, in my view. It would have made sense to release the original Get Back album in it's original sleeve. That way we would have been able to own Glyn Johns' original interpretation of Paul's concept, warts and all, and with some other unreleased songs. There were two versions of Get Back prepared by Johns. Perhaps we could have had both of them in one package. That would have been great for the countless number of serious Beatles collectors.<br /><br />As it is, the Get Back episode remains unresolved, and instead we have something that feels much too close to the original Let It Be album. The rationale of freeing the orchestrated tracks from their Phil Spector over-production also is irrelevant since they were already released in naked form on Anthology 3 (and 2 in the case of Across the Universe).<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the cover is dreadful (surely money is no object for the Beatles - is this the best they can come up with?) and the title is worse. I know it's a \\"Ringo\\" like \\"Hard Day's Night\\" but it just doesn't work. Even the bonus disk feels like a huge missed opportunity. Why not pack it with the dozens of otherwise unreleased tracks that they played during the sessions. That would have been interesting. This is just dull.<br /><br />I adore the Beatles with a passion. But this is really their biggest mistake.

This is a vey good album, better than Never Gone, it has fast dance songs, like Everything But mine, any other way, panic, powerdul rock ballads like Something i already know, rnb ballads like Unmistakable, which has an hauting melody and great lyric, like Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon, the difference from the previous album is in the really stronger lyrics this album has, dont feel let down cause of the singles choise, cause  Inconsolable and and the new Helpless when she smiles, despite a great chorus, are the weakest tracks of the album, BUY IT!
B00006CXSS|5.0|In recent years HBO has surpassed all other venues as the place to showcase quality productions, and with Band of Brothers, an arguably superior adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's extraordinary book of the same name, the network released a fine work indeed. Already considered a classic today a few short years after its initial broadcast, Band of Brothers builds on the tradition of Saving Private Ryan as it draws deeply from a reservoir of talent before and behind the camera to tell the story of the men who fought the Second World War as part of Easy Company in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the celebrated 101st Airborne Division. As it follows this group of remarkable civilian soldiers from training in Georgia thru preparations in England for participation in D-Day, on up into Market Garden, Bastogne, and into Germany itself, Band of Brothers surpasses nearly all other \\"human interest histories\\" and becomes one of the most engrossing, captivating, emotionally-entangling tales that will ever be made. The history of this much-decorated company and its plethora of heroes needed to be told, and in being told deserved the best talents the filmmaking industry could offer: which it received. Band of Brothers is truly among the finest of television achievements and is sure to endure as a revered classic.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I must say that this album definitely lives up to the hype that it was given. Avenged Sevenfold has continued to rock from the first time I heard them and they have continued that rock in this album. Any true A7X fan will enjoy this album and look forward to more great music to come from this band. I expect nothing less from them and they have proved my theory correct, but everyone will have their own opinion as usual.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First brought to my attention by a friend who had seen this series when it aired, I rented the first disc and was so thrilled with it that I then purchased the set and the sequel movie.  Then both my sons and my sister have since purchased and watched Firefly and Serenity.  A big thumbs up for this series, witty, fast paced, imaginative - such a shame that it was never \\"discovered\\" when it was released for television!
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|All in all, I quite liked this movie.  Some reviewers seem to be complaining about the camera work.  I honestly can't say it bothered me.  I can see what they were going for: a documentary / \\"you're there\\" feel, which I think works.  Alot of people seem to be pretty upset about it, but I get the feeling these people get upset about alot of little things (clicky pens for example?)  :)    Someone also said the plot was unnecessarily confusing.  I have to disagree.  If anything it's been dumb-downed a bit from the book, though you can only fit so much into a movie, as always.      So I suppose there are two types of people who should avoid these movies:  the irritable and the easily confused.      If you can handle a little plot, and love action, I highly recommend this movie and the others in the series!

B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I think it's important to point out the difference between Britney Spears the woman and Britney Spears the product. Britney the woman is clearly troubled; her recent meltdowns widely documented and talked about. But with \\"Blackout\\", it's clear that Britney the woman's well-being isn't essential to the continuing success of Britney the product. All that was clearly necessary to create a slick, entertaining pop album for Britney the product was for Britney the woman to be able to get it together enough times over the past two years to come into the studio and lay down some vocals ... and let the army of songwriters, producers and recording engineers do the rest.<br /><br />There is much to be enjoyed in \\"Blackout\\" if you're a pop music fan (and I am). It's full of sexy, glitzy, dizzying musical candy. If Britney had made an album that reflected her current real emotional state, it would probably sound something like Courtney Love's last album. But \\"Blackout\\" continues the fantasy life of Britney the product, who has grown from sexy, coy teenage nymphet to full-fledged glamazon temptress, now enjoying her sexuality with complete abandon.
B000UR9T82|4.0|I won't bother to review the movies here--there's plenty of reviews for that.  Instead, I'm just going to give a quick overview of what to expect from the Blu-Ray trilogy.    First, SPIDER-MAN 3 is the same release as the double-disc Blu-Ray stand-alone version.  It has lots of special features, commentaries, an extras disc, etc.  The movie itself looks very, very good (video quality).    It's SPIDER-MAN 1&2 where the set takes a hit.  Again, video quality is excellent.  SPIDER-MAN 2 includes the \\"2.1\\" cut (via seamless branching, meaning you can watch the theatrical or the new version off the same disc) with extra scenes, including at least one that is VERY funny.      However, what you lose are ALL the extras from the SM 1&2 DVD releases.  No commentaries, no deleted scenes (other than \\"2.1\\"), no \\"makings-of\\", etc.  To me, this was more than disappointing.  It's almost criminal.  I expected many of the old items to appear in standard-def.  Only one bonus blu-ray disc would have been required to hold every single non-commentary special feature, as BD's have 50GB of space compared to 9GB for a standard DVD.  Why skimp here, Sony?    Ultimately, this is the best way to view the movies.  They look AMAZING.  The extras in this set, however, are underwhelming, to say the least.  You're getting everything you need for SM3, but the first two films are severely shortchanged.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Unbelievably fine musicianship makes this CD one of my all time favorites. It restores my faith in the future of music. From the care which is taken in the compositions to the vocals, which I understand are added after the music is composed, this is a superb listen all around. The incredible rhythmic skills of Danny Carey are nowhere more evident than here. And I've listened to most of Tool's other stuff - nothing even comes close to this CD.
B000PMG16U|1.0|I agree with the previous reviewer, Saeed, that the first reviewer, Michael, is way off base that Blu Ray is the clear winner in the HD disc format wars.  From an unbiased opinion, the format wars have been even with no clear-cut winner.  Both sides are gaining momentum at various times.  Right now you would have to say HD DVD has the momentum with the announcement that Paramount is going exclusively HD DVD.    But that's not what we should be discussing.  The simple fact is there have been enough of both types of players sold to warrant the Star Wars movies to be released in both formats.  A release in both formats would sell a lot better then just a release in one of the formats.      So George, if you really want to have a huge money-making bonanza, you won't be selfish (as some reviewers suggest) and you will release the Star Wars movies in both formats.  Afterall, sharing is the best policy.  And George, the best policy is to also make your movies available in the best format(s) available!
B000VZBCWE|5.0|The sound quality on this release is absolutely breathtaking.  I cannot believe how much resolution has been tweaked out of these 26-year-old multi-track master tapes.  This is by far the best audio quality I have ever heard of a music concert of this age.  The sound quality can stand next to any sound quality of today.  Yes, it is that stunning!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I did not expect the audio quality to be as good as the audio quality from the 2004 DVD release of 'Queen On Fire - Live From The Bowl'.  But this beats it, and the audio quality on that release is breathtaking as well.  I had no idea that so much punch, bass, and kick could be lifted from a concert of this time.<br /><br />The DTS 5.1 mix is unbelievable!  It feels like I'm taken back in time and am right there in concert watching the show.  The instruments are so crisp and clean!  The music is not flat and lifeless.  It is full, wide, and alive!  These guys rock!<br /><br />The picture is beautifully restored as well.  In fact, it is hard for me to imagine that this concert was recorded in 1981.  It simply does not show it's age, and now I understand why Queen Productions have taken technology further yet with Blu-Ray and HD DVD issues of this release as well.  The picture is magnificent!  No grain, lines, or darkness whatsoever!  The picture glows and shines!  Is it really this old?  You won't believe it!<br /><br />Since I do not own the original 'We Will Rock You' DVD release from a few years back I cannot do comparisons.  All I know is that this is the best-sounding and best-looking Queen DVD concert in my collection.  Overall, it is simply one of the best DVD releases in my collection.<br /><br />The addition of the 'Live Aid' material on the second DVD is a nice treat for those fans who do not already own the material on the previously released 2004 [[ASIN:B0002Z9HT8 Live Aid  (4 Disc Set)]] DVD box.  Even if one already owns this live set an interview with rehearsal footage is exclusive to this release.  Furthermore, a 1982 news feature from US TV series PM Magazine is a bonus.<br /><br />Queen has never sounded and looked better!  These guys were incredible!  Highly recommended!82 news feature from US TV series PM Magazine is a bonus.      Queen has never sounded and looked better!  These guys were incredible!  Highly recommended!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|After years of not making a record, britney delivers again! this cd is awesomeeeeee! i cant believe how good it is, excellent music
0307387178|5.0|This is one of the best books i've read in a while. It's truly worth the read and the movie is also well worth the money. The book gives a good explanation of Chris's life, personality, and different travel experiences. The movie puts it all into perspective and you can then really tell he wasn't incompetent. I really respect what he did. There are very few people in the world i believe that can drop everything, literally everything in his case, to go out and live their dream. His dream is maybe far fetched for some people but it's still amazing he didn't let anything or anyone hold him back. A truly inspiring story!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|After listening to this project 4 times through, and being an artist myself, I usually listen that way to form an honest opinion. I honestly love \\"Blackout\\". Each to their own in taste by all means; but, I feel like this is really fresh and the very best work that Britney has done to date. It is actually refreshing to listen to someone who has artistically evolved. I can tell that she was comfortable and confident with this work. You can hear it in her voice. I listened to this as the project that it is, not keeping in mind what the media has the intent to attempt to create. I liked Gimme More; however, there is much more to be enjoyed on this disc. If this were Britney's first project, it's possible that she would even be a bigger star than she became. Listening to this actually makes me smile in a world where there are many days that there is not a lot to smile about. I feel that each song has its own feel and there is a contemporary freshness that flows throughout this project. In most negative reviews it condemns the artist and praises the producers. Guess what? The executive producer is none other than Britney Spears. To conclude, the 4 times I have listened to this disc will not be my last. It provided an innovative entertaining escape for me and for me that is what great artistry of any kind is all about. I really hope that people truly listen before they condemn.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Back in the day, I bought a new album called Born in the USA - which I loved.  It made me go back and enjoy songs and albums by this artist, and now...MANY years later, I find the same excitement I had from that first purchase.  He has a way of packaging his more controversial tunes with listenable music, which allows me to enjoy the song, without the message being the cruxt of the experience...but part of it just the same.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|This DVD put together an enhancement for my own religious beliefs as I think it will yours. A must see for seekers of the truth.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|No one comes up with mind-bending futuristic plots like Philip Dick.  And this example, while certainly not his best, has lots of appeal.  As a clairvoyant magician with strict limitations on his ability to predict the future, Nicolas Cage has plenty of tricks up his sleeve and enough of an Achilles heel to be vulnerable and appealing.  Even though the plot structure is more than a little contrived, the fabulous southwest scenery, extremely tight action shots, and solid acting carry the story into the realm of excellent entertainment.  My main critique would be that the villains are one-dimensional and utterly uninteresting, which gives the film a lop-sided feel.
159102594X|4.0|I'll be brief here, this is a book mainly about characters, characters with cracking wit, excellent dialogue. Setting is not yet very relevant here, you could place these characters in any other setting and they would still be enjoyable. There is not as much worldbuilding as in some other debuts we've seen this year ( Ruckley, Rothfuss etc). There is an interesting enemy though, and all in all it is a very engaging read. Book two is already out in the UK and for US readers who do want to wait for the US release, Amazon already has the pre-order up for \\" Before they are hanged\\".
0684857820|4.0|Lucky...was she really?  I'm still reading, but so far, very good.  The rape scene was so well written.  You could almost smell the filth of the area that the assault occured.  And then the distant lost feelings she had, very true from all that I have heard of for victims of this type of violence.  Very well written.
B000W1V44I|5.0|i became a fan of bsb when i was 12. now 22, i bought this album not really knowing what to expect. but i felt i owed it to myself since i was a fan for a long time. i have to say, it was way better than i expected. this album i think is their best one. it's not the same sound as their previous records before \\"never gone\\". it takes what they gained musically with \\"never gone\\" and took it a notch further with this. these are very well rounded, catchy songs with nice lyrics. songs that stand out being, helpless when she smiles, any other way, treat me right, unmistakable, and unsuspecting sunday afternoon to close the album with style. their two bonus songs are good as well, \\"downpour\\" has a unique sound.  Overall, this album is great and i'd recommend this to anyone that was ever a bsb fan for whatever reason. they definitely have grown over the past several years and it's seen on this record. i hope they make another record as good as this one.
0812974611|5.0|Robert Harris was born in Nottingham in 1957 and attended Cambridge University. He has been a reporter on both Newsnight and Panorama, Political Editor of the Observer, and a columnist on The Sunday Times. He is the author of a number of books, both fiction and non fiction.    I have just read this book for the second time and found it even better than the first time. I am a bit of a sucker for anything to do with Roman history and although this may not be the most accurate account of what happened when Vesuvius erupted, no one who witnessed the eruption and the subsequent mayhem and destruction caused to the city of Pompeii is still alive, or for that matter has been for the last couple of thousand years (for those who like detail, AD79). Forget the authenticity or otherwise of the story, just sit back in the comfort of your chair and enjoy the story.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|`Children of Men' is one of those rare `important' films, one everyone needs to see.  It's heartbreaking, eye opening and most of all heartwarming with its depictions of hope shining forth from the bitterness of the present.  In `Children of Men' we encounter a torn London, savaged and broken down with despair and hopelessness.  The world has collapsed in the few short years following the infertility epidemic and now, resting in the year 2027, all seems to be lost.  The film does a brilliant job of capturing the feeling of hopelessness and apathetic attitude that forms in the hearts of earths residents.<br /><br />There is no reason to care anymore because humans in general have no future.<br /><br />This is where we meet Theo Faron.  Theo's life is all but dead to him.  Clive Owen masterfully displays the utter desperation that plagues this mans soul.  We can read this across the crevasses of his face, the saddened expression in his eyes, the downward slant of his brow and then sulk in his step.  Even his words struggle to find themselves as he speaks to others in attempts at communication.  This is the first thing that I noticed about Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece.  Clive Owens performance beautifully compliments the ravaged setting he inhabits.<br /><br />Theo finds himself kidnapped and violently escorted to a secret meeting with his ex-wife Julian, the leader of a rebel activist group.  She is requesting his assistance in transporting a young woman, a refugee who has a secret, a very important secret.  He soon finds out what that secret is when he meets young Kee, a Fiji born woman who is, believe it or not, pregnant.  Thus begins a harrowing journey to transport Kee to meet up with `The Human Project', an organization willing to help her.  Theo meets much opposition along the way, some expected, some not, but the journey is worth any cost.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron was unfairly snubbed a directing nomination last year.  He brilliantly crafted this film so that the audience can take this journey alongside Theo and Kee, feeling every emotion and even stirring some new ones in the pit of our souls.  The film is expertly executed and completely absorbing to watch.  The sets are so real, so authentic, so engrossing that I could feel the concrete floor against my feet and breathe in the thick air.  The cinematography is orgasmic and it's an utter shame that it lost the much deserved Oscar.  As the camera swept through each scene I found myself inching closer to the screen to take it all in.  The sound editing, the visual effects, everything about this film is effortlessly maneuvered to linger in the minds of the audience.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is ultimately a film of hope and survival.  It wisely establishes a bleak reality before coming forth with glimmers of a better tomorrow (in fact the boat Kee is trying to reach is rightfully named `Tomorrow').  It cements itself in the hearts of the audience so much so that it draws on raw emotions.  There are moments that brought me to tears especially as the film comes to its climax.  Being a new parent I was moved deeply by this film, a film that proved what we all know, that children are our future, our only future and without them life is not worth living.journey alongside Theo and Kee, feeling every emotion and even stirring some new ones in the pit of our souls.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|My So Called Life is one of the best shows to ever come out on TV. This show was ground breaking when it first aired in 1994-1995.

0345457692|4.0|I have to say, I was really happy with Altered Carbon. For a first time author, Richard Morgan spins a very good sci-fi tale full of action, suspense and cool technology. In fact the latter - technology - was actually believable. Other far-off books look at various gizmos of the future and tend to make the reader really work very hard to suspend reality and believe it all possible. But Morgan combines existing nomenclature with fictional techno babble (like neurochem and needlecast) to create a world that could actually happen under the right circumstances - a bit like the world created in the Matrix movies to be honest. After all, aren't we all just electrical impulses anyway?     Once the reader opens up the mind to accept the possibilities the book then becomes just a really good detective novel - full of twists and turns and a little sex too. Some might be turned off to the strong language and lurid sex scenes, but it's pretty typical for the genre. As for the \\"film noir\\" writing style - I could live without it. I've never been a big fan of noir with all of its jump cuts and one and two word sentences. It can be distracting at times and a bit hard to follow. But once you get into sort of a reading rhythm it works fine.    This book is pretty long and has a lot of characters so I found myself having to read backwards a few times if I hadn't picked it up for a couple days. But all in all it was easy to follow and keeps the reader wanting more. In fact, right after I finished Altered Carbon I picked up the second Takeshi Kovacs novel and enjoy that one so far as well.    Considering the fact that I just sort of stumbled on Altered Carbon by accident at the library, I was very glad I did and will continue reading this author.

0451528018|5.0|I was expecting this book to be a bit boring - it's for a literature class. But it turned out to be easy to read and exciting!
0783231032|5.0|All I can say is, this is an incredibly well-made movie. Well, not ALL, but this  still is very well-made. I watched this again last night, and fortunately, I got the expanded version this time. I bought the original release on tape a long time ago, and good as it is, it's still missing something. The \\"Collector's Edition\\" is the full-length release. Yes, it's a very long movie, but it's such an epic of excess, being almost two and a half hours long only adds to the nature of it.<br /><br />I tend to stay away from All-Star extravaganzas, as the idea of brimming over with celebrities only seems to be a selling point, helpful in ticket and rental sales when the film itself really isn't that good in the first place. Not the case here.<br /><br />Where to start? Speilberg parodies himself in the first scene by lampooning \\"Jaws,\\" the girl here accidentally finding a Japanese submarine, instead of a shark. And the roller coaster ride just picks up momentum from there.<br /><br />It's funny, how in December of 1941, the whole country was worried about Japan and Germany invading the United States, and 60 years later, the country was again on High Alert, this time radical Muslim terrorists are the subject of worry. But judging from what I have heard and read about those days, it would seem the general mood portrayed in the film was accurate. And sadly, people don't seem to be like this anymore. There was, despite infighting, unity against a very dangerous, real enemy. And anymore, the enemy seems to be applauded. Just an opinion. This isn't meant to be a political rant, I just get very angry when I think about Pearl Harbor, the World Trade Center, and where the world has been going lately.<br /><br />One thing in this movie that jumps out at you, is the over-the-top nature of the whole thing. A stand-out is the choreography in the USO dance contest scene. It has to be seen to be believed. To the person who hasn't seen it: A young man named Wally is involved with a very beautiful girl named Betty Douglas, against her father's wishes. He has been preparing for an upcoming dance contest, but the rules have changed. No civilians this time. The girls are only allowed to dance with soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Wally refuses to put on a uniform, hence he's a civilian, but still manages to gain admission. A soldier, nicknamed \\"Stretch,\\"  complete bully and very boorish in his demeanor, decides Betty is the girl for him. So when Betty throws him over for Wally at the dance contest, a humiliated Stretch decides to exact a pound-of-flesh retaliation. A fight ensues, and the damage to the club, and ultimately Hollywood Boulevard, is simply jaw-dropping. But watching Stretch chase Wally all over the dance floor, is one of the best sequences you will see anywhere. Among the dancing is a violent confrontation, a disaster waiting to happen.<br /><br />There are many sub-plots in 1941, and detractors say it's too many elements pulling it too many ways at once. I don't agree. True, there is an awful lot going on, and it can overwhelm one, but look at the scenario in the story. Southern California is in a state of High Alert, the whole country was trying to recover from the Pearl Harbor attack, Hitler was still in power, and everyone was simply galvanized with emotion. How the film makers still managed to make a movie with such a premise contain humor, is an achievement. It contains comedy, action, a dance scene, romance, violence, and family life. It is a vey mixed bag, but some things go so far before you realize it's intentional; it's supposed to overwhelm you.<br /><br />And, this is a very politically incorrect film. The language itself, probably wouldn't fly today. Calling Japanese people \\"Japs,\\" \\"Slant-eyes,\\" and \\"Yellow,\\" were standard fare at that time. Here we have Japs, Krauts, you name it. I don't celebrate racism, far from it, but even more, I decry political correctness. This film is to be seen as a time piece, and this is how people talked, acted, and thought at the time.<br /><br />To whit, I say, if you haven't seen this movie, it would be worth your time to watch it, but be warned; this edition, the superior one, is almost two-and-a-half hours long. If you have, and like it, I'm preaching to the choir. If you don't like it, that's your opinion, we all have our tastes, but I really don't know how someone could not like it..

B000NA28I4|3.0|Where does one start?  I really hate to criticize movies in general because a tremendous amount of work goes into them.  However, this movie truly should have been a lot better.  They really missed an opportunity here to start a nice franchise.  It's not Lord of the Rings and there really is no reason it needs to be so I don't really understand all the comparisons.    Storyline: The overall plot, I thought, was pretty sound.  But the tone was a little too childish.  I felt like it was even pandering to young kids.  They didn't gap the bridge too well between making a movie for kids as well as adults.  It felt a little lost here.    Direction:  It was clear that the director is a special FX guru.  Maybe he shouldn't direct films after all.  It's bad when a movie like this wreaks of misguided direction.  If I can tell it's bad direction, that's not good.    Editing:  I kept thinking the editing was all off.  There were times when a scene would end and I couldn't tell what the heck the filmmakers were trying to say or even what was going on.    Special FX: I thought they did a truly wonderful job with the effects on Saphira the dragon.  Loved it.  They really nailed it.    Cast:  Thank gawd for Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz.  Robert Carlyle was great too!  John Malkovich I think is very miscast here.  I felt like he was phoning in his performance.  The performance he gave here can be seen in other films.  I swear I was watching his same character from \\"In the Line of Fire.\\"    Set design/costumes:  Ah..this could have been better too.  It didn't look or feel cohesive.  It felt a little patched together and a little cheesy.      Length of film:  Waaaaaaay too short and no wonder it felt like story lines and plot pieces were missing.    I feel sorry for the film makers involved on this project.  So much work and such an oddly paced film.  I felt like they concentrated a lot of their dollars on the FX for Saphira (which I admit is wonderful) but sacrficied a little too much elsewhere.    The only reason I give this 3 stars is because I thought the special dragon FX were spot on.  This really could have been a great film from such a well loved book.  Despite my own general poor review, I hope someone makes a 2nd film because I think they can salvage something.  I really do!    Whoever goes on to make the Pern series (which will be amazing if someone does it and does it right), I hope they learn a lesson from the mishaps and misteps in the making of this film.
B000VT6FAO|4.0|I will admit that I was skeptical about this album because i didn't care for the first one. I was excited about the first one since it was produced by the same guy who worked with Sigur Ros. But it ended up sounding like another DM album. So you can imagine my reaction when i found out that he was working on his second solo album.   I saw the video for Kingdom and thought it was pretty good and found the song pretty good as well. So I decided to give the new album a chance and found myself impressed by it. It has cool electronic sounds with a dark vibe. For me, it's the avante-garde brother of Playing With The Angel. The only minus is that at times the lyrics are not that well written and lack a good sense of poetry. But otherwise it's a good effort and Mr Gahan proves that he can stand on his own.       Highlights:  Saw something  Kingdom  Endless
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors. His books stand above even the best books I've read. As an aspiring writer, I always feel inspired after reading a Follett novel and wish I could somehow capture the magic he has with the written word. It is hard to review a book like World Without End. It is incredibly long and also a sequel to Pillars of the Earth. World Without End covers a time span of about 40 years and the main characters remain the same. In \\"Pillars\\", the novel covered the lives of several characters. Fans of Pillars of the Earth will no doubt want to read the sequel. Those who have never read Follett should probably start with his World War II thrillers.<br /><br />I never read historical novels, so I don't know how Follett compares. In describing 14th century England , he keeps it simple and assumes the reader can draw most of their own conclusions. The characters are fun and complex, yet nothing new. Follett's novels seem to all have variations on the same types of characters. The novel revolves around four characters: Merthin, the builder, Ralph, Merthin's brother, the amoral knight, Caris, the independent minded girl, and Gwenda, a poor, plainlooking girl. Each character is featured at different times, facing triumph and tragedy. Many, many other characters are woven throughout the story, but they come and go pretty easily. Around page 750, or 3/4ths through the book, Follett introduces the plague, and a lot of main characters are killed. The book changes course at this point and you have a normal novel-length conclusion where the four main characters are the star.<br /><br />I'm a big Follett fan, so I knew I'd enjoy this book. But what keeps me reading page after page. This is a long book and requires a huge investment of time. It's not suspense. World Without End covers the entire lives of the characters, and there are many twists and turns, but none of the plot elements are so strong that they carry the entire book. It's not the characters. As I said before and as mentioned in other reviews, the characters in this book are really no different than Follett's other characters. I kept reading page after page because Follett powerfully portrays (and I'm assuming he has done his research for historical accuracy) the internal and external conflicts that existed in the 14th century. At that time, the church ruled everything, especially in Kingsbridge. They collected rents and taxes, they could charge women with being witches. Also, the citizens of the town believed the monks and nuns had direct lines to God. Only the monks could practice medicine, although their main answer to everything was bloodletting to rid the body of \\"evil spirits.\\" This was obviously a time where everyone accepted their lot in life. So when Merthin and Caris question the authority of the monks, problems arise. Also in play was the class system. Ralph went into training to be a knight and had incredible power over his subjects, including Gwenda. He could kill men and rape women and face little consequences.<br /><br />We live in an age where you can't be forgiven of sins by paying money to monks and you won't be cured of sickness by slicing open a blood vessel. So I was mesmerized to read about a people who had hopes and dreams just like I do yet lived in a society whose ideas were so primitive. The novel is a constant battle between the status quo and progress. In one passage, Follett writes about Caris's attempt to build a hospital using medical knowledge she discovered by working on patients. She is opposed by a monk who trained at Oxford by priests. Caris loses and Follett writes: There would be no separation of different categories of patient. There would be no face masks or hand washing in vinegar. Weak people would be made weaker by bleeding; starved people would be made thinner by purging; wounds wold be covered with poultices made of animal dung to encourage the body to produce pus. No one would care about cleanliness or fresh air.\\" This constant conflict is what makes the novel so compelling.<br /><br />As I finished the novel, I wondered what message, if any, I would take away. First, I was thoroughly entertained. Follett takes you into a new world. Second, the entire scope of a novel comments on the nature of God. Christianity has obviously advanced a lot since the 14th century, but the debate is still there. How much of what happens on earth does God control? Is there free will? If Follett were to ever write a third book in this series, I believe a perfect time frame would be the Protestant Reformation where the power of the Catholic church was finally questioned.<br /><br />The novel is full of violence and lots of sex, which can be an enjoyable diversion or an annoying turn-off, depending on your point of view. Follett is a master with words, his prose his simple, humorous and grabs you and takes you into his world. I definitely recommend this book but think you would be wise to read his other thrillers before reading Pillars of the Earth or World Without End.flict is what makes the novel so compelling.

B000TGJ8IU|5.0|This movie was great!!! If you liked 300 with all the computer effects, then this movie is like it but live action. If you like history or just a good bloody war film about the battles of the past, this is it. It tells the story of the raise and fall of a legendary hero.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|If we never heard anything about her personal life she would be great. Since it's popular to bash her I was ready hear how this album tanked but it is good.  Can't hate when there is nothing to hate. She has heavy back up and it's not as polished as her other work but hey! they wanted her to hang herself and she didn't despite any support.  I think this is the last we will hear from her before she commits suicide.  So enjoy our last Britney ride.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I'm just a delirious Wright-and-Pegg fan and can't wait for their next project.  Pegg and Frost are a fabulous pair.
0525950079|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I could hardly wait for World Without End to come out.  I loved Pillars of the Earth, but WWE was boring.  I was ready to quit about half way through, but I made myself finish it. I was so disappointed because I generally like Ken Follett very much.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|BRAIN SALAD SURGERY, Emerson, Lake & Palmer's best original album, has finally gotten the respect it deserves, with a remastering job worthy of its level of technical accomplishment. The acoustic slow-dance love ballad \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" nestles up to classical rockers such as \\"Toccata\\" and epic tales such as \\"Jerusalem.\\" All of the previous remasters (including even the mid-Nineties Rhino version) were flawed in some way, but this version is beyond reproach. They finally got the right tape of \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" and are using it for this remastered CD. If you get this one, the self-titled debut, and TRILOGY, plus THE ESSENTIAL EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, you'll have the ultimate ELP library.
B000F7BPLG|4.0|While the naval warfare aspect is subdued in this chapter of the Honor Harrington series, it is none the less another great chapter of the space opera. Honor is once again up against a battery of enemies that will stop at nothing to see her either dead or destroyed, and this time they are her neighbors and fellow Keys of Grayson. A vicious and bloodthirsty group of reactionaries, who view Harrington as 'the harlot of Satan' hatch a plot to bring the dreams of Honor, and possibly of the Protector Grayson to its knees.<br /><br />The characters are a little less fleshed out in this volume, and the action is almsot wholly political, but the plot is masterfully executed with a wonderful cllimax, and an epilogue showing the few enemies who escape unscathed sheathign their claws for the next moment of weakness out of everyones favorite battle commander.
B000002MX7|5.0|Chaka has a powerful voice, and a powerful band, that will take you on an emotional ride. And this is a long album that is consistently good. The only thing that would make me hesitant to recommend this is the possibility that there may be better options out there from the same artist. She has cut quite a lot of discs over the years.    Ain't Nobody and Through The Fire (as recently mangled by Kanye West) are the highlights for me. Papillon and Tell Me Something Good (live) are awesome too. There are some ballads here, and Love Me Still is the best of these.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is the most touching film I have seen in awhile. It is probably one of the only movies that I can watch time and time again, only loving it more each time. It came out in 2003 and was an immediate hit among young and old. There are many subplots with in the movie, and they are all connected in some way. Each of the eight main characters has a dilemma that deals with love. Whether the characters are falling in love or out of love, this movie links every love interest possible. The tagline of the movie that brings all the stories together is simply that \\"love actually is all around.\\" The film is a romantic comedy that is sure to capture the hearts of everyone.     The movie takes place in London, England, five weeks before Christmas. Each character is introduced in the beginning of the movie. The movie is set up using a vignette style to tell the story. Each character is battling or embracing love in some way, and as each story unfolds, so did my love for this movie.     Love Actually was written and directed by Richard Curtis. Richard was born in New Zealand in November of 1956. He has been nominated for many awards including the Golden Globe award for Bridget Jones Diary in 2001 and 2002, an Oscar award for Four Weddings and a Funeral in 1994 and Love Actually in 2003 and 2004, and an Emmy for The Girl in the Café in 2005. These are his four most famous movies. I've seen them all, and they are all brilliant. He is also known for the British character Mr. Bean, who also makes an appearance in Love Actually. Curtis attended college at Oxford University. When he was in college, his girlfriend left him for a man named Bernard. In each of his screenplays, there is an unpopular character named Bernard.      This movie is so wonderful because of the conclusions these characters come to at the very end. After each story of love has had its beautiful revelation, the characters are all very content with their lives. The last scene is at an airport, where all the different characters are brought together, waiting on someone they love. It is a very emotional scene, and an amazing ending to the movie. I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who will watch it. It is hilarious, romantic, and inspiring.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is sick crazy, I like the new sound from Britney took me just a few listens and the album was stuck on me. One song in particular though that's in my head is \\"Hot as Ice\\" I cannot get it out of my head... But I love it, and this album so please buy it and support Britney 100%<br /><br />electrifying
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I have been watching so many movies lately that either make me cry or leave the theater with a disturbed feeling. Finally when I saw this movie it made me laugh. You don't have to be a child to love the movie. I was just really happy and I had a good feeling leaving the theater. I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|This movie was awful!  Talk about your white-trash, trailer park hero movie!  Think about it, the main character is some hermit that spends his days up in a mountain huntin'. Suddenly, and out of the blue, the government needs him to come save the president (Which Danny Glover is a really bad choice for the bad A kind of bad guy).      Well, it turns out to be a set up, and when the main guy runs for it, he meets one of the other characters who is a government agent, and also tries to arrest him.  Mark Whalberg's character throws him down with unnatural ease, the kid doesn't even have a chance.  Then, after an amusing run for it, Whalberg looks up his dead partners fiancee, who, conveniently enough, has a sultry southern accent.    After nursing him up from being shot, she develops something akin to a Florence Nightingale syndrom and falls for him.  (Obvious story twist here).  When he's healed, he decides to go after the guys that tried to frame him, and so his new girlfriend gives him her ex-fiancee's huntin' rifle (no joke) which he then proceeds to use to take out several baddies, and convinces an agent to join his cause, when the agent tries to dissuade him from going after the bad guys, wahlberg uses this quote to let him know how serious it is \\"I don't think you understand, they killed my dog\\", that thar makes this here serious!  In the end, the bad guys get away legally, so wahlberg's character takes the law into his own hands and goes and kills them anyway, making him just as bad as the villains.  And the final shot of the movie is him and his girlfriend driving away into the darkness in their blue chevy truck.    Some of the gratuitous scenes include a kidnapping of his girlfriend where she is walking around in a bra and levi jeans (cause, ya know, i know that's common loungewear, i suppose it would be if you happen to be on an episode of COPS!). The guy only goes into back water towns and gas stations that are obviously designed for hunting towns.  Granted, there was some interesting eye candy, but nothing amazingly exceptional, you'll get more out of watching The Bourne Identity or any of its' sequels.  In fact, I almost believe that this scrip was written by some foot-hills hic that went to his annual trip into town and saw a trailer for The Bourne Identity and thought to himself \\"That thar seems like a good pictchur ta see, i betcha I culd make me a motion pictchur movie like dat.\\"     I grew up in good ol' Idaho, and some parts of this movie were downright nostalgic of going to the CAL Ranch stores to get our hunting licenses, it has the same kind of feel to it.  Trust me, this movie is bad, if youre looking for a realistic action flic, go watch the new Bond movie, or one of the Bourne movies and wait around for the next person to take a shot at making a cool action flic sometime in the future.  Rent this one if you must, but don't buy it, unless you happen to like over-elaborate versions of a COPS Episode.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|i was very impressed by this album they even got a new drummer who i thought would be unreplaceable but they did it i still think i like there old one a little better but the new one tears it up too my favorite song on the album is \\"what a horrible night to have a curse\\" i love the way it starts you just want to turn it up louder and louder the whole album is good though so go get it and also check out \\"unhallowed\\" there first cd its my favorite by them
B000UX6THK|2.0|My copy of the Gold Box Edition of Twin Peaks came today.  Sadly, the sound does not work when you select the 5.1 Surround.  Only the music plays and none of the actor's voices are heard.  So sad, as I was really looking forward to this.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|i was pretty impressed by this album i wish he would have screamed at least one time in it but its still a very good i actually just saw them live about a week ago and it was honestly one of the best shows i've been to they played like 25 songs from nola to over the under hearing the songs from this album live for some reason made me like them more     favorites/three sons and one star/on march the saints/and most of all pillamyd very heavy and upbeat    over all very good album if you hav'ent heard much of down i would reccomend (nola) their first album its by far my fav of theres so go check it out
1401300529|5.0|I have read many other books on the Korean War and thought I knew it pretty well. Two other very good books are by John Toland and maybe the best by Clay Blair, but The Coldest Winter is different. It isn't so much about the overall war, and nothing about the air war, but it is more about the personalities who conducted the war, at the highest levels and the lowest levels. It does go into several battles in depth, and we learn what life was like for those commanding and for those who had to fight in conditions as horrendous as Americans have every had to fight in, considering weather and terrain, and a brutal enemy. But what meant so much to me was what we learned about the leadership of the American forces, Truman, MacArthur, those in Washington, Tokyo and Korea, as well as an in depth look at the leadership in North Korea, China and Russia. It is amazing all the things that factor into decisions, not the least of which is simply politics like worrying about the next election, on a grand scale, that affect us all. If you are at all interested in the Korean War, or the world at that time, read Clay Blair's book, then this one. A truly great read. You will wonder how the author did it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|what can i say...this cd is hot sh**!!!  i bought it today and can't stop listening to it. 'get naked' 'break the ice' 'freakshow' 'perfect lover' are already my very fave songs...esp. 'freakshow' that song is an easy #1 club smash..can't wait to hear it in the clubs...def. a great album, in my opinion, its her best one.
0743298039|3.0|I did enjoy reading the book - it was a page turner for sure - the writing style was interesting and the storyline was written in a way that I cared to find out how it ended.  Unfortunately, after all was said and done, it was forgettable.  I was disturbed at the author's refusal to give the story any sense of dating - I got the impression Margaret and the dying Vida were living in some early period 1900s - but couldn't be certain for sure.  There certainly wasn't any mention of technology.  I, personally, like to date my characters to give my mind a better scene for visualization.  Second, the super dysfunctional families in Vida's history were impossible to relate to on any level.  I couldn't even relate to their feelings one way or another.  Lastly, the \\"girl in the mist\\" reality was so hard to believe.... I don't want to give away any of the story, but \\"come on!!!\\" - are we to believe this could actually be?  All in all, and interesting read, but OBVIOUSLY the author's first novel.... I am surprised it received so many 5 star reviews.  Some times I think people are just way too generous.
0061186422|4.0|My husband and I listened to this as an audio book. The audio book was read by Neil Gaiman himself.<br /><br />As always the stories are wonderfully crafted and Gaiman is able to create worlds that each of the short stories allows you a quick glimpse of. I have always had a bit of a problem with short stories. Mainly my issue is that if the short story is good it usually leaves you wanting more. I am always a bit frustrated with good short stories because they seen to leave me unsatisfied. That being said I love all of Gaiman's works.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed though that this is not a new collection of short stories but a compilation of previous short stories that is meant to be appropriate for children. Some of the stories I had read previously in Neil Gaiman's \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\". I have not yet read \\"Fragile Things\\" but I have heard that the remainder of the stories are from that collection.<br /><br />Also the reading of the stories was slightly disappointing. We were listening to this in the car and some parts of the stories, especially the troll bridge one, were whispered so softly by Gaiman that even with the radio cranked to full volume we couldn't hear what he was saying.<br /><br />This book is quality Gaiman work and a great collection to buy for a young adult. If you own \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" and \\"Fragile Things\\" and don't have a need for a more young adult focused book I would skip this book because you probably already own most of the stories. Still the stories are great.
B00005K3O4|5.0|If you like corny, campy, cult movies, this is it.  I really can not add to the reviews here except to affirm what has been written.  I loved the balloon dogs!  My husband and I laughed all the way through this movie.  If you like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and other films like it, you will love this horror spoof.  (I wouldn't recommend it for young or sensitive children though!)
055358894X|4.0|I received this book as a gift last Christmas from some friends. The writer, Scott Lynch, is their cousin and had given them a number of signed books to distribute as they saw fit. Historically speaking my experience with books that have been gifted to me by friends or family (excluding my direct family of course) have not been all that great. So I put off reading this book for quite some while.<br /><br />Once I did start reading the book I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good book! The writing is tight, the descriptions are crisp and really take you to the scene. It is a clever book overall and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The book details, as the title suggests, the Lies of the main character Locke Lamora. Locke ends up an orphan after a plague kills his parents. He ends up being sold to an old priest known as Chains. Chains isn't exactly a priest though; he is more of a con artist. Chains teaches his initiates the finer aspects of conning people. The book jumps between the training the Gentlemen Bastards (Chains' gang) go through and Locke's latest scheme to usurp large amounts of money from the nobility of the city.<br /><br />This book is fun and clever. Initially I found the chapters alternating between present and past to be a bit irritating. It felt like as soon as you got back involved with the main story you were switching back to the past story and visa versa. Then I realized that the interludes to the past were usually revealing something about the characters that was vital to the next part of the current story. Then these interludes became pretty clever.<br /><br />The book is non-stop action and is a fun read. It is not a quick read; there is a lot of description in these books and a lot going on. You definitely have to keep your wits about you when you read this book. I am definitely interested to see what the next book in the series, Red Skies under Red Seas, brings.
B000R4SMD6|3.0|I couldn't wait to watch this movie, as I have been an Anthony Hopkins fan for some time.  He was great!  I enjoyed watching him toy with the over-confident and arrogant young prosecutor.  I did like the way he set the crime up so that there would be no proof that he was the killer.<br /><br />Without Anthony, though, this movie would be a flop.  I want it in my collection of movies simply because I thought Anthony's acting was superb - certainly not because it's an excellent movie.  It's an all-right movie starring a superb actor.
B000002W9Q|5.0|The soundtrack to this unforgettable and heartwarming story has several of the great oldies of the 60s, but is more strongly anchored in my opinion by the the likes of Eric Carmen (Hungry Eyes), Tom Johnston (Where Are You Tonight), Merry Clayton (Yes) and that beloved, unforgettable duet between Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, \\"(I've Had) The Time Of My Life\\". Either way you look at it, rarely will you find so many great songs on the soundtrack of the same movie.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book, and I am disappointed so often now when other fiction that I read can't measure up to this amazing work of creativity!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My 2-yr old loves this movie and asks for it over and over.  I find myself signing the songs around the office, but I don't mind, I still love it.  It's an old-fashioned story of adventure and friendship that passes the test of time.  THe songs are not corny.  It's nice to see a cartoon that is paced a little slower than the cartoons made today.  You can tell it is an old soundtrack, but the quality of the sound and the video is excellent.  The bonus features include a new music viseo that I don't care for - but a 10 year old might.  Also included is a deleted character and a section where they just play all the musical sections of the movie.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold has always been very hit or miss. Their first cd had about 2 or 3 great songs, and the rest bordered on mediocre to downright awful. Their next cd, Waking The Fallen, was brilliant. Every track was unique and showed their growth in song writing and musicality. Then came City of Evil, their mixed bag of metal/hard rock androgeny. Not only did it offer some great songs like \\"Bat Country\\" and \\"Beast and the Harlot\\", but it also offered a sappy love ballad called \\"Seize The Day\\". Now comes their self titled CD, which is a great step forward for the band. After City of Evil came out, I was worried that there would soon be a downward spiral into mediocrity and self parody. Instead, their 4th cd delivers the goods. Here is a track breakdown for the iTunes crowd that might only want to buy a song or two:    Critical Acclaim: 4.5/5 Their first single, which ironically didn't receive critical acclaim, is actually pretty good. It is an ode to the troops, and although the rants throughout the song are annoying, the song is so good that it makes up for it. It's no \\"Bat Country\\", but it is still a great song.    Almost Easy: 4.75/5 Any singer that sings lyrics \\"I'm Not Insane\\" like a possessed James Hetfield has something going for him. This is their second single, and it is lighting up the charts. It's fairly catchy and accessible for the casual hard rock/metal fan.    Scream: 4.5/5 No wonder they released the cd right before Halloween. This track is kind of silly, but it has a driving groove and is just a good all around metal song.    Afterlife: 4.6/5 This song would have been a 5 if it weren't for the uninspired chorus. The rest of the song is great, but the chorus just doesn't work.    Gunslinger: 4.75/5 The first minute and a half are straight country, with slide guitar and everything. Then M. Shadows realizes he is in a metal song, and unleashes hell. The song is great, and the intro fits in perfectly with the rest of the song.    Unbound (The Wild Ride):5/5 I love this track. It sounds like it would be playing in the background during a chase scene in a movie. The continual 16th note piano works perfectly with the drum beat as they flow into the chorus. It's a very aggressive song and usually makes me drive at least 10 mph faster when I'm in my car.    Brompton Cocktail: 4.75/5 Another very heavy track that is just straight forward metal. I have nothing bad to say about it.    Lost: 4.5/5 T-Pain? Peter Frampton? M. Shadows? This song is great, and then it goes all T-Pain on us. I actually have nothing against it, but I could see how others might. I like the effect and think it works well with the song.    A Little Piece Of Heaven: 5/5 It seems that Avenged Sevenfold is channeling their inner Mr. Bungle/Danny Elfman/Panic! At The Disco on this track. I freaking love it. The track is their Bohemian Rhapsody, and it has the symphony to prove it. The song switches tempos and styles every 20 seconds, and somehow it works perfectly. My favorite track on the album by far.    Dear God: 4.3/5 This is their countryish song that has many up in arms, but I actually don't mind it. The song is well-written and flows nicely. It is a good closer to the album.    Overall: 4.5/5 This CD is great. It is what City of Evil should have been. Their song writing improved and the whole cd flows well together. Although it isn't as good as Waking The Fallen, it is still much better than most metal out right now.
184195425X|4.0|Maybe I got caught up in all of the hoopla over this book.  I read it after it was out for two years and all I kept hearing about it was \\"You have to read this book!\\", \\"It's the best book of the Year\\", things like that.  So I finally sat down and read it.  I agree with most people, it was a very wonderful book.  Not the best I've ever read, but one definately worth reading.  The beginning was way too slow and it took around 100 pages before we find him on the lifeboat. My advice is to not get caught up in all of the hoopla like I did and not to expect too much.  Maybe then you will enjoy the book more.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|It's rare to find a band that is popular with the TRL crowd, and yet is still very talented both musically and vocally. Avenged Sevenfold's second cd is a thing of pure beauty. Every song on this album is flawless. I can honestly say that I would rate every track 5/5. It's one of those cds, like Master of Puppets by Metallica or The Blackening by Machine Head, where every song fits perfectly with the album. I just bought their 4th cd yesterday, and it makes me think that they can never live up to the greatness of their second album. Although they are still a good band, their consistency just isn't there anymore. I highly recommend this cd to anyone looking for good metal music. I know some people with give me crap for categorizing them as metal, but they are in my eyes.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Here's the ultimate slasher movie. \\"Halloween\\" still is and will always be the best slasher movie ever made. Its terrifying tale about psychotic killer Michael Myers still has the power to scare the hell out of the viewer. Even though I have seen this movie well over 50 times, it still keeps me on the edge of my seat. And it's still the best film from horror movie director John Carpenter. Not only did Carpenter direct the film as well as co-write it (with the late Debra Hill, who was his occasional writing and producing collaborator at the time), he also composed the now famous scary music score, probably the best ever for a horror movie. The movie's story about a six year old boy from Haddonfield, Illinois who kills on Halloween night in 1963 and then returns to the same town 15 years later to extend his crime by stalking babysitters is still powerful to this day. Jamie Lee Curtis made her film debut here as Laurie Strode, and it would be the beginning of a great movie career. Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles provide moments of terrific comic relief as Laurie's girlfriends Annie and Lynda, respectively (or as Lynda would put it: \\"totally\\"). And the late veteran actor Donald Pleasence would have his most famous role as Michael Myers' doctor and pursuer Dr. Sam Loomis. \\"Halloween\\" went on to become the most successful independent film of its time. The movie only cost a little over $300,000 to make, and grossed $70 million worldwide. Thanks to this outcome, eight more \\"Halloween\\" movies have followed (including the recent remake). But the original 1978 film is the real deal. It became so popular that afterwards in the early 1980s a bunch of slasher movies came out that tried to imitate the success of \\"Halloween\\" with most of them failing. The one \\"Halloween\\" imitator that didn't fail was \\"Friday the 13th\\" (1980), which was a big hit at the box-office and launched its own successful movie franchise. But others like \\"My Bloody Valentine\\", \\"The Burning\\", \\"The Prowler\\", \\"He Knows You're Alone\\", \\"Graduation Day\\", \\"Mother's Day\\", \\"New Year's Evil\\", and \\"Silent Night, Deadly Night\\" failed to capture the same success as \\"Halloween\\" did (or \\"Friday the 13th\\" for that matter). Some of these movies might have made back its money since they were all made on a very low budget, but none of them grossed the kind of box-office numbers that \\"Halloween\\" did. But the \\"Halloween\\" franchise eventually joined in on the parade. Three years later, \\"Halloween II\\" was released, and the series hasn't ended yet. But none of the follow-ups have topped the original film, and no matter how many more \\"Halloween\\" movies are made from here on out, none of them will ever top the superior first film. And one of the main reasons why this film is so much better than the sequels and rip-offs that followed is that it relied on scarring its audience instead of grossing them out. Even though it's violent, there's very little bloodshed in this movie. \\"Halloween\\" is a must-see. Plus, an excellent feature is presented on the DVD. \\"Halloween - A Cut Above the Rest\\" is an excellent documentary about the making of the movie. If you'd like to see how this long running movie series got started, then watch this entertaining feature.ows You're Alone\\", \\"Graduation Day\\", \\"Mother's Day\\", \\"New Year's Evil\\", and \\"Silent Night, Deadly Night\\" failed to capture the same success as \\"Halloween\\" did (or \\"Friday the 13th\\" for that matter).

006091307X|5.0|This is the first book I wilfully read twice. The first time I dream-read through the entire thing totally lost in all the names of strange people and corporations and pacts and deals, knowing only that it had something to do with mail and history, knowing only that there was a new twist, a new bit of learned information almost EVERY SINGLE PAGE, so much information crammed into one small book that I thought my head would explode. It wasn't an enjoyable read.    But then I read it again (God knows why, because so many people liked it and maybe I missed something?) And the second time, I loved it. In the short space of 150+ pages, Pynchon weaves in an ellaborate plot (that never gets resolved, if you haven't heard from the other reviews already) and poignant characters within the frame of a novel very beautifully written and a lot more lyrical the second time around. Yes, people have accused him of being overwrought, but that is exactly what I love about his prose in this book. I read Gravity's Rainbow and enjoyed the hyper-hallucinatory-reality of that book as well, but in some ways, I think that some of his best prose are in this little book. They're dense but not digressive. They're very consice and he skillfully manages to convey just the right discription of a sunset combined with just the right metaphor for an emotion to evoke a mood with both an eerie somnolent glow, like sitting on the safe-side of mountains whose opposite side is  a hellish destination, but you spend your entire time trying to get to there, finding that it's impossible as you gaze at the red horizon. That's how this book feels. It's like coming so close to the truth but finding that it's too deep or too far.    This book, along with V, are exellent 1960's Pynchon works, and for those who haven't read him and have only heard about him, yes, while his works DO have typical 'Pynchonian' tags or quirks to them, ultimately, each of his works are incredibly different. Gravity's Rainbow was excellent, but it possessed a very different kind of magic that you will find herin, or in V, or even in his short stories (Slow Learner). I know that some people have a problem with his work, and I don't think it's because those people want answers spoonfed to them, but because they may feel that Pynchon himself didn't know what he was writing about and perhaps that was the case. But if anything, that only adds to the mystic quality for me. He made something with so many layers to it, that he could sit back and allow the reader to gaze upon it, think of it what they will, connect with particular characters or find hidden gems that the author may not have even intended. In the end, this book hangs on the psyche like a howl in the wind, a mourning of a time lost, a time that no one remembers and may not have even existed.
6305291446|4.0|At long last, here's a \\"Halloween\\" movie sequel that's worth talking about. \\"Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later\\" (the seventh film in the series) goes back to its roots by bringing back a character that's been sorely missed in the last four films of the series. As a matter of fact, this film was made as if the last four films didn't even exist. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphant return to the role that made her a star. She also suggested this project. Kevin Williamson, who was the writer of the first two \\"Scream\\" movies (which was inspired by \\"Halloween\\"), was an executive producer of \\"Halloween H2O\\", and along with director Steve Miner (who got his start by directing the second and third \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies) they made a very good horror movie. \\"Halloween H2O\\" takes place in 1998, 20 years after the original film with Michael Myers continuing his pursuit of long lost sister Laurie Strode. But finding her has been very hard to come by for Michael, because Laurie faked her death shortly after what happened in 1978, and 20 years later has been living a different life in California under the name of Keri Tate. But the memories of Halloween night 1978 continue to haunt her, which has become too much to handle for her teenage son John. She's the headmistress of a private school in Summer Glen, California that John attends. John has a nice girlfriend, Molly, while Laurie/Keri has a love interest in Will, a fellow staff member of the school. Things aren't exactly perfect for Laurie/Keri as the film starts, and things eventually get worse when Michael Myers finally tracks her down. \\"Halloween H2O\\" is easily the best sequel of the series. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a powerful performance here, and her presence in this film gives the \\"Halloween\\" series a much needed jolt of adrenaline. Adam Arkin is very good as Will, a person that Laurie/Keri feels comfortable with telling about her dark past. Michelle Williams (who was starring on the hit series \\"Dawson's Creek\\" at the time, and years before receiving an Oscar nomination for \\"Brokeback Mountain\\") has a good part as Molly, and Josh Hartnett (in his film debut) is terrific as John. LL Cool J provides the film's comic relief as the school security guard, and Curtis' real life mother, \\"Psycho\\" star Janet Leigh, has a nice cameo as Laurie's/Keri's school secretary (I like the \\"Psycho\\" reference in one of Leigh's scenes). The main reason why \\"Halloween H2O\\" works is because it's more closer to the original film than the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth \\"Halloween\\" films. And director Steve Miner and his writing team came up with a good story by taking Michael Myers out of Haddonfield and putting him in a small town in California. It was getting boring with each \\"Halloween\\" movie going back to Haddonfield for more mayhem. A new location I thought was a very good idea. The film is pretty violent at times, though it's the least violent \\"Halloween\\" movie since the original film. \\"Halloween H2O\\" of course isn't up there with the first film, but it comes the closest of any film in the series. The \\"Halloween\\" movies that are worth seeing are the first, second, and seventh films. The rest are either so-so (like \\"Halloween 4\\") or dreadful (like \\"Halloween 5\\"). \\"Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later\\" is a very good sequel to the best slasher film of all time. Plus, it was a big hit at the box-office, grossing $55 million domestically.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I bought this for my 4-year old Granddaughter.  She loves Disney movies and sat through the whole movie with me.  It passed the Ashley test.
B000FA57US|1.0|The \\"Halloween\\" franchise hit rock bottom in 1989 with the series' fifth entry, titled \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\". This is arguably the worst movie of the series. It's a badly acted, badly written, badly directed piece of crap that should be avoided at all costs. Donald Pleasence, who gave a very good performance in the original film, gives one of the worst performances of his long career in \\"Halloween 5\\". Pleasence overacts so terribly in this picture that you kind of hope Michael Myers will get to him just to shut him up. It's a real shame to watch this terrific actor being forced to look foolish on screen (especially when he tries to bully out some answers out of Michael's niece Jamie, who at the beginning of this film is mute and has developed a psychic link to Michael). Not to mention the other new characters make no impression whatsoever. An actress by the name of Wendy Kaplan comes off extremely annoying as Tina, who acts so hyper in most of her scenes as if she had previously been eating tons of Halloween candy. Ellie Cornell does return from the last movie as Jamie's cousin Rachel, but she ends up getting killed off early on. And the film goes over the edge in the climax when Michael tries to kill his niece. The climax is a perfect example of sloppy filmmaking. The director of this garbage is someone by the name of Dominique Othenin-Girard, and this filmmaker has no directing talent at all. The writing is atrocious with lots of asinine dialogue, thanks in part to Donald Pleasence shouting out his lines much of the time in absurd fashion. The main story: Michael Myers continues his quest to kill his young niece one year after the events of \\"Halloween 4\\". Big deal. It's basically the same movie as the last one. \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\" is junk at the highest level. Avoid this one at all costs!

B000TXNDUW|5.0|First off, if you consider yourself any kind of film buff and if you haven't seen Breathless, shame on you.  Not only is it #1 on my personal favorite films life, but i also consider it one of the 5 most important films ever made in cinema history.  In short, it is a film worth owning on DVD.<br /><br />I had been petitioning for Criterion to release this title in their collection for years and it finally happened-- Breathless has been done justice.  And I must say that my expectations for this Criterion release were greatly surpassed; it is by far the best Criterion DVD i own.<br /><br />Amazon seems to agree with the release's quality as it has ranked this edition of Breathless as 94 in their Essential 100 DVD's.<br /><br />Here's what makes this release so good:<br /><br />+ The new transfer.  beautiful.  it is clear and the image has excellent contrast.  i noticed details in the film that i had never noticed before in my crusty Fox-Lorber edition.  Same goes for the sound transfer.<br /><br />+ Packaging.  I love the box are and packaging.  the 2-disc set comes with a pretty thick book of essays and interviews that are all very informative and examine the film from a number of perspectives.<br /><br />+ Special Features.  I dont know of any other dvd release of a classic film that has such comprehensive special features.  i had considered myself somewhat of an authority on breathless... that is until i watched every available feature on this edition and realized that there was so much i didnt know!  although all of the features are great, the best one was the documentary, Chambre 12, Hotel de Suede, an 80 minute piece that if probably the most comprehensive body of info on the film that ive ever come across.<br /><br />I highly recommend this new release.  In my opinion, you cant go wrong with this film, or with this definitive DVD release.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|I was pretty doubtful upon seeing that this movie was directed by Spike Lee, I have seen some of his early films and found them to be unsatisfactory.  But with \\"Inside Man\\" he creates a unique point of view that just adds to the stellar cast and excellently written plot.  It had lots of twists and turns that kept me interested.
B00006X06U|4.0|Travelogue is a 2002 follow-up to \\"[[ASIN:B000040OVH Both Sides Now]],\\" released in 2000, and which pioneered Joni's work with a 70-piece symphony orchestra.  Unlike the former album, which mostly reworked jazz songs from 1930s and 1940s (but also included a scintillating reworking of the song \\"Both Sides Now\\") this CD explores her own work from the 1970s through 1990s.  Aside from the 70-piece orchestra, Joni is backed by jazz legends such as Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Kenny Wheeler, drummer Brian Blade, bassist Chuck Berghofer, and organist Billy Preston.  Several things are notable about these arrangements: most of them are much slower than the originals, many of been transposed down, some by as much as a fourth or a fifth, and the guitar is entirely absent while the jazz elements of the songs have been enhanced.  For the most part this works very well, as Mitchell's now-Smokey voice seems much more comfortable in the lower range than where she used to sing in her early career.    I have only one objection to this CD, which is the reason for the 4-star rating, and which has been endemic in attempts to marry pop or rock music to a symphony orchestra (see earlier Moody Blues, for example): the songs are simply over-arranged.  A symphony orchestra is almost inevitably overkill in the pop/rock environment.  What I would have loved to have seen (and which could easily have made this a five star product) is for Joni to have used a simple string orchestra instead of a whole symphony.  In addition, there are a few tunes that would have benefited from some of Joni's own brilliant guitar work.  The overarrangement can be especially noticeable on tunes like \\"Woodstock,\\" which began life as rock tunes and fit awkwardly into this new conception.

In this book, you could feel the sadness and frustration and the rare joy that the characters experienced.  It may sound trite, but the story really touched me and made me think of the characters for days after reading the book.     I recommend this book to everyone I know along with The Kite Runner.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Let me make it short and simple because no matter how much I take moment to say my opinion and prove a point, some \\"fans\\" will always take my word as something bad and immature... here goes, People grow up, minds open up and words evolve along with the melodies, to Avenged Sevenfold there's more than meets the eye... Yes I know yesterday fans will find a bad review to anyone who thinks avenged keeps getting better since city of evil... This is my case, if not very well appreciated... My advice ... If you like singing more than screaming, Buy it with no hesitation as this album expresses a new sound to this Yet Rock Band, very well crafted album, it really is quality... Such a good album, too bad I'll get many unhelpful votes as these \\"fans\\" will click for fun and ignorance instead of finding the real art in music. And really getting to grow up with the bands that have made them rock the heck out of a concert or party.  In conclusion, this album is 5 stars hands down with 2 thumbs up!!!!
0307237699|5.0|Is it possible for a human being to restore a quality of public servanthood that speaks more about service than about politics--more about morality and logic than about money and fame?  If so, then Barack Obama is our time's greatest possibility, and his recent book, The Audacity of Hope, is the testimony of that chance.<br />  At once a gripping memoir, a candid view behind the scenes of modern day political terrain and a passionate plea for the future of America, Obama's book succeeds on every criterion of good writing.  He incorporates a voice-driven narrative style that allows us a glimpse of the human being behind the CNN appearances and the keynote address at the Democratic Convention of 2004 that first thrust him into the limelight.  But Obama also provides a carefully wrought description of the past of this tension-embodied country--a history that does not mince words or blur edges.  However, Obama consistently advocates for the ideals upon which America was founded, using them as chapter headings for the book, and also as guiding principles for his own mission statement about the direction of our country and our world.<br />  Two cornerstones of The Audacity of Hope are logic and values.  Obama appeals to each consistently, as he does when discussing his ideas about taxing.  He writes, \\"...at a certain point you have enough, that you can derive as much pleasure from a Picasso hanging in a museum as from one that's hanging in your den, that you can get an awfully good meal in a restaurant fro less than twenty dollars, and that once your drapes cost more than the average American's yearly salary, then you can afford to pay a bit more in taxes.\\"  Such assertions come on the heels, usually, of Obama's firmly held belief that one facet of the American identity is the marriage of individual striving and the Golden Rule--that Americans possess a deeply held belief that we should treat one another the way we would want to be treated.  This idea begins to serve as a microcosm for the premise of the book, and, one might say, for Obama's personal standing in politics and in life.  Using this logic of values, he elucidates some of the most controversial issues of our time (such as the tax code) in an effort to procure progress.<br />  To serve this design of values and logic, Obama incorporates a style of writing that is at once intelligent and articulate, but also rife with a storyteller's markings.  For instance, he usually begins each chapter with an anecdotal revelation--a tangible memory that will work and weave its way through the chapter until it will assert itself in a fully realized moment by its close--uniting all the themes therein.  In the chapter titled, \\"Opportunity,\\" Obama begins by revealing the need for a senator to fly often.  He writes, \\"Most of the time I fly commercial and sit in coach, hoping for an aisle or window seat and crossing my fingers that the guy in front of me doesn't want to recline.\\" While senators are afforded the capacity to fly on a private jet--one with all the perks of great food, ample leg room, and even beds--Obama says that he consistently tries to fly commercial.  He proceeds to tell the stories of many Americans he has met on his travels--stories of men and women working two or three jobs, single-parents, men who have been laid of because their skills have been deemed unnecessary in the transition of manufacturing businesses to overseas nations.  By the close of the chapter, Obama's final sentences convey a powerful stance about the nature of politics and of politicians, the nature of who they serve and what their values are, and--perhaps most importantly--about who he tries to be as a senator himself.  He writes of a man who came up to him while waiting in a long line at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.  \\"I have early-stage Parkinson's disease, he said, and a son who's three years old.  I probably won't ever get to play catch with him.  I know it may be too late for me, but there's no reasonsomebody else has to go through what I'm going through.\\"  After relating this man's words to us, Obama simply comments, in the final sentence which owns its paragraph, \\"These are the stories you miss, I thought to myself, when you fly on a private jet.\\"<br />  Barack Obama brings to the political terrain an attitude of public service--a return to what our forefathers sought in creating a democracy.  He argues for the realization of an America that is both present and yearning to be ever-more present.  In writing that is fluid, honest and logical, Obama manages to buttress a perspective of values that has become far too rare nowadays, and one that has the potential to produce a drastically more united America in the very near future.somebody else has to go through what I'm going through.\\"  After relating this man's words to us, Obama simply comments, in the final sentence which owns its paragraph, \\"These are the stories you miss, I thought to myself, when you fly on a private jet.\\"        Barack Obama brings to the political terrain an attitude of public service--a return to what our forefathers sought in creating a democracy.

B000067J1H|4.0|This movie was awesome. Very awkward at parts, but quite passable. The fighting and action was crazy, but watchable. Edward Norton is a very good actor, and he's so damn cute. He has a great scene, where His Boss Enters the room, and he starts to kick his own butt. He punches Himself repeatedly, and Proceeds to throw Himself into a Glass Shelf, and He's very, very bloody, By the End of it All.<br /><br />Blood can be Seen, On His Face and Shirt, but He gets Pay For the Rest Of the Year (50,000 grand or so), And is Emancipated from His Dead End job!! I loved the character He played. Apparently, He was Nameless in the movie. However, I skimmed through the Wikipedia page, and it stated His name was Jack. We'll just say He was Nameless. &lt;3<br /><br />I think the most interesting character though, was the chain smoker, Helena Bonham Carter aka Marla Singer in the movie. She was quite intriguing to say the least.<br /><br />Pros: Nice fights. Lots of blood. Some violence. Explosions, FTW!<br /><br />Cons: You see Brad's abs, but we fail to see his wonderful backside. Maybe next time.<br /><br />4 stars.

0792833201|5.0|Did Steven Spielberg realize that \\"They're Here\\", would be entered into the scariest lines ever? This movie is one of my favorites and it still gives me the chills. Hopper and Spielberg created a real masterpiece even though both Hopper and Spielberg didn't see eye to eye. The movie has great special effects and was considered the scariest movie of it's time. Although it's a \\"little older' now, it still scary. I hate that clown!!!<br />The movie is based on the Freeling family living in a new suburban neighborhood created by the real estate company Steven Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) works for. Little does he know that the owner of the real estate company built homes on top of areas that used to be cemetary plots (he never made arrangements to move the bodies, only the headstones). But this is the least of the Freelings worries. The family is visted by ghosts in the TV where only the youngest daughter hears them. Carolanne (Heather O'Rourke) talks to the \\"TV people\\", and they somehow leave the TV and dart into the wall of her parents bedroom. Unexplained disturbances follow until the spirits from the TV get nasty. They even manage to grab Carolanne from her dimension and bring her to theirs. As the Freelings get nervous, scared, and angry that no one believes them a group of paranomalists agree to help and tape the occurrences, as long as its not shown on \\"That's Incredible\\". When things still are happening, enter  Tangina (Zelda Rubenstein) who is a well known psychic. Steven (Nelson) tries to trick her because he believes her to be a phony. As Steven is laughing saying that he was trying to answer her through his mind, Tangina shoots back by telling him sternly that she did hear him and she doesn't like trick questions! Tangina explains that there is a force keeping Carolanne hostage and will not let her go. She calls this thing, \\"The Beast\\". In the sequel, the \\"Beast\\" takes human form of a reverand (Julian Beck) who refuses to believe that he is dead.<br /> The movie is transfered great on the DVD. The only extra is the movie trailer as well as the scene selection. This is a great movie to have in your horror collection.transfered great on the DVD.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|OLDBOY is the 2nd installment of Park Chan-Wook's vengeance trilogy that is loosely based on the Japanese comic by Tsuchiya Garon and Minegishi Nobuaki. I use the term \\"loosely\\" because the plot, characters and almost everything else is completely re-worked for the big screen. I've read that Park saw his film; \\"Sympathy with Mr. Vengeance\\" a sort of commercial failure, so he comes back with an effective counter-attack. Oldboy made me re-think the old adage: revenge is best served cold, because this film emits SCORCHING FIRE.<br /><br />Oh Daesu (Choi Min-Sik) is a man with a wife and child. He is kidnapped and kept in captivity in a small room, fed with dumplings mostly as his main dish, with only a television to keep him company for 15 years. Someone paid an obscene amount of money to incarcerate him indefinitely. Mentally tortured and overcome with a desire for revenge, he plots for escape. One day, he is set free and dumped in the streets, with a suit to wear and left with some money. Daesu meets and hooks up with a young sushi chef; Mido (Hye-Jeong Kang) to look for the man responsible for his incarceration.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" has a lot of visual wallop and visceral punch. Park's stylish direction and the VERY intriguing premise are truly awesome. There are quite a few films that really stayed with me; this film is one of them. I can still clearly remember the great soundtrack, the visually original hallway fight, the tooth-pulling, the live octopus devouring and others. The ingenious style of its direction and the balanced intensity of its execution keep the proceedings grounded. The plot is a bit over-the-top but to the director's credit, it remains balanced and believable.<br /><br />This film may be considered an ultra-violent dark film by most people but it is actually very tame when it comes to blood and gore. The proceedings are so well executed that the atmosphere emulates violence and darkness. The very set up and sequences of what happens in each shot creates a lot of tension that people will remember it as a very dark and violent film, that it is in fact gorier and bloodier than it actually is. Park has the hand of an artist and is a true visionary to be able to pull off this sensory manipulation. \\"Oldboy\\" has a lot of uncompromising twists and turns.  You will have to keep in mind that Park's films are usually a character study of its main characters.<br /><br />Aside from Park's stellar direction and premise, the film draws its strength from its excellent cast. Choi Min-Sik gives a near-stellar performance as the main character. I remember his haircut that looks almost like a mangled lion with a chopped black mane. His portrayal of a BROKEN everyday man is one of the reasons why \\"Oldboy\\" has been elevated to \\"cult status\\". The film's final image; Choi's joyful but at the same time, infinitely sorrowful SMILE will forever be remembered by its audiences.  Ji-Tae Yu plays the villain; Woo-Jin, suave and handsome; with his Bond-like physical attributes and a very elegant charisma. Despite his good looks, Ji-Tae Yu has a very menacing presence and does command attention like a deity, with a \\"mere\\" mortal as his plaything.<br /><br />One VERY minor (so minor) fault the film may have is that the method of which the actual revenge is executed. The hint of hypnotism may require a tiny suspension of disbelief. Everything plays out so well for the antagonist; we are all expected to believe that he is a genius, with an intellect dedicated to the torture and punishment of one man. He has dedicated 2 decades of his life to his vengeance which may be one of the coldest, if not, certainly the most perverse. However, this very minor flaw is forgivable, because the film is so focused and succeeds in immersing us in its sequences that all we consider are the things that it has done PERFECT.<br />Oldboy explores a moral issue about vengeance; what happens next after you do exact your revenge? If revenge becomes a main focus of your life, what else is there to live for? With Daesu and Lee Woo-Jin, the answer is very different.<br /><br />OLDBOY is PURE contrasting cinematic genius; it is repulsively ugly but at the same time, it is breathtakingly beautiful. It is gut-wrenching but at the same time it is very delicate. It is cold but indeed emotional. It is mind-bending at times and certainly artistic in its execution. With its flair and style, it is a bunch of contradictions that adheres to coherency.<br />Park will not only entertain but make you uncomfortable. It does no other film has done: to entertain at the same time analyzes pure emotional pain. It is TERRIFIC!<br />Highest Possible Recommendation! [ 5- Stars]<br /><br />Recent News: Hollywood will be re-making this film with the director of \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\" at the helm. I was watching MTV when I heard this news; Good or bad? Let's wait and see...With Daesu and Lee Woo-Jin, the answer is very different.

B000UR9TQE|5.0|That will mean - we'll get to see    Celebration Day - snuggled between Rock and Roll and the full version of Black Dog (now in it's entirety on 2003 DVD release)     to follow should be:  Over the Hills and Far Away  following by  Misty Mountain Hop (now in it's entirety on 2003 DVD release)right into-  Since I've Been Loving You    I hope we get to see Bonzo wailing on those tympanis during The Rain Song - I would love to see this whole video w/out the fantasy sequence (if you look closely near the end -you'll see one of Bonzo's mallets come up over the mounted tom tom - Bonzo using mallets !!!)    We'll see hopefully a full version of Heartbreaker    and The Ocean (now in it's entirety on 2003 DVD release)    on the last night of tour July 29, 1973    they encored with Jonesy doing an organ solo - then they did the song \\"Thank You\\" to finish that show. Hope that's on there too !!!!    John Stephanski  TEARWAVES drummer
B000V6BE6C|4.0|While almost completely different from sounding the seventh trumpet, their new cd is pretty catchy. Been a huge fan of A7X but will admit when something sucks and there are a few songs on the CD that do (personally i think Dear God and Almost Easy) but overall its a good cd however most of the songs are a lot shorter than the ones on previous albums but some tracks like Scream and A Little Piece of Heaven make up for it
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I see all the sheep have come out to support Brit. Always amazed me how the media can take a no-talent piece of trailer-park trash and make people believe she's a star. I bet with the right production crew, 75% of the reviewers here could put out a better cd. Baaaaa for you, but Naaa for me.
B000VWYJ8Q|1.0|Bourne Ultimatum (movie #3) is similar to Bourne Identity (movie #1) in that it exists simply for the sake of the action. There's hardly any literary content at all. It's just a straightforward plot that moves the action along. It's like so many other action movies. Sure the production is impressive with explosions, stunts, car chases, fighting, etc, but as far as dialog, motivations, characters, plot twists, or anything else clever, that's all been carefully stripped out. That doesn't cut it for me and I rate this movie low. I like the Bourne Supremacy (movie #2) the best. That one has more story.    Other reviewers here agree with me on the above points, but I disagree with them on the excellence of the action. I don't think it's all that great as I'll explain below along with my low opinions on the lack of story. I agree with another reviewer here that my review on the literary merit of the movie is a waste of time. The movie is about action and that's it. Critiquing its literary merits is like critiquing the safeness of a motorcycle. It's simply not about that.    Anyway....  The girl in this movie hardly speaks at all. She just walks around looking dumb and worried. If the girl was paid by the line, they paid her about $50 for her \\"role.\\" Her close-ups become comical because repeatedly they cut to her, she looks worriedly into the camera, and then doesn't speak.    As many others have pointed out, the shaky camera work is annoying/nauseating/amateurish direction. I really hated it and it really did make me sick.    The story has a long, straightforward build up to an ultra-lame, straightforward conclusion, which makes me feel like I wasted my time. What's the big deal about his training anyway...you just need to train him as a sniper, which is no big deal, and then you're done. What Jason does is not that different than any other soldier, especially a sniper. Much more interesting was Bridget Fonda in \\"Point of No Return\\" and her cycle of training, initiation,and wanting out.    Again in the \\"unintentionally funny\\" department, we get comedy/spoof/\\"so bad it's funny\\" like running commentary:  \\"He's looking right at her!\\"  \\"He drove off the roof!\\"  As if we, the audience, couldn't see that he just drove off the roof. Actually this comedy material was some of the best fun this movie has to offer.    Jason takes the unneeded/indefensible risk of calling the CIA security down on him before he even cracks the safe. No trained burglar would do that. He just needed to hang up the phone as soon as the guy answered and said his name. And if cracking the safe was that easy the CIA wouldn't be using that safe. How did Jason know that the spook used his name as the safe voice password? He could have used any phrase. Ludicrous.    During the chase where the assassin chases the girl, Jason repeatedly jumps through the windows. Once is enough, twice is repetitious, thrice is an eye roll. He did it, like, six times. Severe lack of imagination on the part of the movie makers. Plus, that assassin must be a super blood hound to be able to track the girl from the street as she runs around on the rooftops.    Grade: Waste of time.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I bought this cd because I've been a fan of Britney's since I was fifteen and despite the media circus that surrounds her, I think she was the most talented out of the Pop Princess that came out of the 2000 era.  The way I see it, this album is for her fans that have grown up with her. Its more adult and its good to hear her singing about something not so bubblegum.  She's lost her innocence so why be forced into that stereotype.      The songs are fun, catchy. They arent meant to make you think, they are meant to make you dance and they do.  All of them have their own unique quality and its very Britney.  Her style hasnt changed, just the lyrics, so if you're a grown up and you liked her before, try her now.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|well ive been awaiting this album since the beginning of summer wen i heard that A7X was planning the halloween relese. honestly at first listen i was a bit shocked. the album starts off heavy, with a political tone (which i expected after hearing the ending of city of evil)... but it softens out as it moves on.   the first track critical acclaim is awesome and probably one of my favs (if not my no.1) on the whole cd.  almost easy fits the simple/mainstream structure of an ideal radio hit. its a good listen.  scream is pretty cool. im enjoying this song more and more every time i hear it. its definately better than almost easy  the next 3 songs are all pretty mellow and kind of follow in the same footsteps as sieze the day, all with a distinct message that works in thier own way. very decent songs depending on the mood u happen 2 be in at the time.  brompton cocktail is a damn good listen as well. its not a soft and has a good melody 2 it. one of my favorites.  lost is also a softer song... (which puts about half the songs on this cd in a \\"not so heavy\\" catagory)  and my favorite song on this album is a little piece of heaven; about a man who murders his wife and does his deed 2 her. then she comes back from the dead and does the same to him, ending in a grim wedding. it sounds like it could fit in an eerie musical (like nightmare before christmas), just by how the song is done. you'd have to hear it. WICKED  overall the album is pretty mellow but hits hard when it wants to. i give it a 4/ 5 because when it does hit hard, it does it well. and when it wants to be calm and collected, it achieves. A7X experimented with quite a few different sounds and expanded thier musical talent. a definately good cd for anyone who likes city of evil... and maybe even fans of waking the fallen as well
0143038419|3.0|I just finished this book and feel slightly disappointed. It would seem that I'd have enjoyed it more as I used to live in NYC, I know and love Italy, I studied and practiced Siddha Yoga, I love food, prayer and being in love. Gilbert did a lovely job with the writing, but how she wrote about some of the emotions really disturbed me. I almost didn't get past the first part because of all the descriptions of her neurotic and depressive symptoms. OK, so that was very brave of her to confess and describe those things, but my God it was annoying to read about it so many times in so many ways and from so many vantage points. I found myself thinking, \\"if she is trying to get me, the reader, to get how she feels - I get it, already! You can stop now!     I'm left feeling ambivalent because I liked a lot of the writing and I did not like how she dwelt on some of the subject matter.
B000002JSP|5.0|I admit that I bought this CD only for the song \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", which I had recorded from my older sister's Led Zep album onto a cassette.  In going through my old cassettes, I found this song which sounded clear as a bell but obviously, couldn't be played on my CD player.  So that is why I bought \\"In Through the Out Door\\".  Well, to my surprise one day, I put the CD on from the first song and played it all the way through and I had totally forgotten all those great songs on this album!  What a pleasant surprise!!!  So not only do I have \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" now, but lots of other great songs as well!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|There really isn't much for me to say here, I only wanted to post this up on todays date!  Great movie!
B000WMVJ7E|5.0|Wes Anderson's films are often misunderstood. Starchy, disillusioned cynics need not see his films. His films are sentimental and adhere to sensibilities that require a certain amount of adolescence lingering on in your adulthood. If you have grown up so much that you no longer wish to partake in any kind of silliness, horseplay, or tomfoolery then you will most likely be lost watching this film as well as his others. This is not to say that his films are not for adults. They are. His films are almost always made seemingly for the PG13 rating system of today but are slightly peppered with a few things that will surly garner an R rating. I can easily imagine him throwing in some F-words like this film had, or like in the Royal Tenenbaums, a nude poster for Margot's play. I think he wants the films to be rated R and does not want his childlike veneer that lies over all his work to be mistook for something geared towards kids. One of the best ways to look at his films is to just imagine the film as how a child might imagine adulthood. They always have a spy-like secret agent feel to them. I remember the way I felt when I was 7 when I had stayed up late the night before to watch a James Bond film on TV. I felt the thrill of having been a witness to adulthood, danger, sex, and quick one liner comedy. All Wes Anderson films have this, and perfectly recreate this feeling in me.<br /><br />This film, as well as his others all have a focused attention to subtext and mes-en-scene throughout . The characters as well as the carefully constructed sets have many detailed props, much of which is never fully explained. Bruises, glasses, a belt, a robe, a song or an ipod, perfume, a poisonous snake (I had childhood love of reptiles), and many mysterious compartments on a beautiful train all are there for your enjoyment. Some times items are explained and other times they are not. This gives the film extraordinary depth, intricacy and weight that is often lacking in most films today. His films are put together so well and with such care that you leave the theater feeling as though you were just on an adventure that you have been waiting for all your life. It's not coincidence that he uses homes, boats, and now a train to carefully construct his story around. These are vehicles in which throughout our daily lives, stuff happens. They facilitate the adventures for the people who are interacting within them. The possibility for adventure is always present when one goes on a trip, takes on a task, or goes home after being away for a long time. Anderson understands this as perfectly as any human on this planet can. Only Stanley Kubrick filled his films with as much props and used as much subtext and symbolism. Anderson is not as allegorical as Kubrick was and his films are certainly much, much different. Still the compositional care to film as a visual medium in which each shot needs the same amount of care and consideration as the one that just followed is 100% present on par with Kubrick.<br /><br />I see in Anderson's films many possible influences that he has possibly used. Here are a few of them: Joseph Cornell, Peanuts, J D Salinger, The Hardy Boys, Ian Fleming,  Johnny Quest, Jacques Cousteau, Kramer VS Kramer, Woody Allen, Devo, Classical music, and indoor home made tents under blankets. This is just a short list. Anderson has admitted to several of these. Just spotting the Egon Schiele book neatly placed by a water color in Hotel Chevalier is proof positive that Wes has good taste in Art and has a depth that can not easily be summed up in just a short list.<br /><br />He is the best and most unique filmmaker alive today and has single handedly taken the place of several of the old guard who are either dead, or way over the hump and beyond their prime. Anderson has also brought back to the movie-plex a push for the old cinema that used to draw people in with stories and tales meant to make us think, imagine, and feel like we have experiencedsomething meaningful without making us feel guilty or overtly sad.  I will be eagerly awaiting his next film, The Fantastic Mr Fox, based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl. This film is for kids but if you have read the book, it is, for a kids book, extremely violent and full of danger. The fact that Anderson is crossing the fence and visiting a kids story rife with danger for his next film is no surprise to me. I could easily see him having a career that goes back and forth between adult-themed films geared for kids, and kid-themed films geared for adults.  I will be there with my pole vault waiting to get in.<br /><br />Bravo Mr Anderson!ithout making us feel guilty or overtly sad.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|The Boss gives best preformance since Born in the USA.  Little bit sad but very consistent rock.  Fans would love it
B00001OH7U|4.0|It's true that Station to Station is basically a transitional album, but it's just a damn good one. In fact, I wish all transitional albums were as good as this one! Basically, this is Bowie somewhere in between disco and ambient, and you'd be surprised at how fantastic it is. But I do \\"only\\" give it four stars because I'm no fan of \\"Word on a Wing\\" (a song like that would've sounded fantastic in Elton Jonh's hands, but not in Bowie's), and that makes up a sixth of the record.<br />Anyway, onto the good! You're probably not gonna believe me, but the title track (easily the longest Bowie ever attempted) is avant-garde disco. That's right, avant-garde disco. The first five minutes of it are packed with ambient Eno-esque noises; and the alst five are more along the lines of Chic or someone like that. You'd expect something like that to fall over dead, but in no way does it - it's one of my top ten Bowie songs, because of that weird fusion of styles. This also established a new identity for Bowie - the \\"Thin White Duke\\", who would be Bowie's alternate persona for the next few years and (according to rumors) is a parallel to cocaine, something Bowie happened to be addicted to at the time.<br />Moving right along, Bowie flirts with full-on disco twice on this album, and not only gets away with it, makes it fantastic in both cases. \\"Golden Years\\" (a major-league hit) has a great sing-along vocal melody and dance beat; \\"Stay\\" (my second-favorite, behind that title track) has a marvelous heavy guitar riff. Bowie's vocal performance on \\"Wild is the Wind\\" is classic - you gotta hear it! He sounds evil! \\"TVC15\\" doesn't live up to those, but hey, the best of this album sets a pretty high standard, and anyway that's one cool sax part.<br />This is easily one of Bowie's very best albums. Any fan should have a copy.
B0006GAI6O|3.0|I bought it as a gift. She watches it alone, and can't get enough of him.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This soundtrack is a fantastic, modern interpretation for a new generation of fans.  My best friend and I weren't Beatles fans before watching Across the Universe, but we were after.  We LOVED the movie and the music - so much so that in addition to this album, I got 2 other Beatles albums.  I know alot of old-school fans were displeased by the film, but it really is a tribute to the Beatles that only further enhances their legacy and longevity.  I was especially impressed by the performance of Evan Rachel Wood, who I've watched since Once and Again.  Who knew she had such a soulful voice, as evidenced on Blackbird?  Timothy Mitchum on Let It Be is another standout on an album full of wonderful performances.  This is the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Finally.    What else can be said.  I bought this box set even though one of my friends has the original box set and I have all the episodes on my computer, but it was totally worth it.  This box set was created for us long suffering fans by people who truly felt our pain.  The quality of the DVDs are better than the original box set, and all the little goodies (the booklet with the episode guide, interviews with the creators and writers on disc 6) are a nice touch.  This show has held up in the 10+ years since it went off the air and it's finally been given the DVD treatment it deserves.  Thank you, Shout.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|This is typical RUSH minus some sparkle. If you are a diehard RUSH fan, owning this CD is required. Otherwise, it might be one to skip.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I was searching Amazon, dying for a period movie (there just aren't enough out there to satisfy) and I came across this one.<br /><br />This is a story of a strong-willed woman named Margaret who's a vicars' daughter. She befriends a poor, sickly woman & her father and gets involved with the factory workers union strike (and her friends' dad works at the factory). The factory is owned by our hero John and we see throughout the story the stressful struggles he goes through to maintain the family business. We also see the growing feelings that Margaret and John have for each other as they bump heads and they are enjoyable to watch. The drama of the factory workers was very interesting as well.<br /><br />There was one part in this movie when our two main characters first meet and having never heard or read the original story, I kept saying \\"This is our hero?!\\" and that was because of his shocking, off-putting opening scene. But as you keep watching you understand why he did what he did.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed this movie enough to add it to my collection. It was fun getting involved with each character and the story was good. Pleasantly pretty Margaret and handsome John really worked well for satisfying my need of a period movie. If you're looking for a period romance drama with a decidedly Dickensian feel, you should definitely give this one your attention.
1905236042|5.0|I am a yoga teacher that suddenly found myself teaching a \\"Kids Yoga\\" class.  Looking for fun, creative tools to reach children, I purchased Yoga Pretzels and it was the best investment I have made.  After a 1/2 hour of doing yoga poses and pranayama, I pull out the cards and let each student pick a card (they are usually saying, \\"Is it time for the cards yet?\\".  Each student demonstrates the pose and then we all do the pose together.  The team building poses are their favorites.  It brings lots of laughter and joy to the class.  I now use one of the cards to end each class. We all sit in a circle, hold hands, close our eyes, and take turns gently squeezing the person hands sitting to the right and say a positive word about how they are feeling.  This goes on until we the circle is complete.    My thanks to the creators of Yoga Pretzels!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was flipping around the TV one Sunday night and I came across a movie on PBS that I recognized as Jane Eyre. I've always hated Jane Eyre movies. Love period movies, but never jived with J.E. Every rendition that I had seen (about five) always left me feeling like I never want to see that movie again, mainly because Edward was either portrayed as a straight jerk or a bratty little boy. So I was going to continue flipping, but I suddenly wanted to see who was playing Mr. Rochester. So we get our first seen with him and from then on I was hooked. I loved how Toby Stephens delivered all of his opening lines (and all afterwards too) and Ruth Wilson is the best Jane Eyre that I have ever seen. I had never seen such great, intense chemistry between the characters of Jane and Edward...ever!  I cared so much for them both. I was completely taken by surprise especially because of my long standing against seeing any more Jane Eyre movies. As a person who has always felt this way, I am so glad I didn't change the channel. This one is worth it! I even called my sister that night to tell her that Jane Eyre was on and she was already watching it. I found out the next day that my mom watched it too. As soon as it was available on DVD, we all bought it. It's so worth it! You will actually love Edward Rochester and of course Jane Eyre. You will not be disappointed.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The individual seasons were a much better deal for me.  I don't really care about packaging.  If my plastic cases tear, I can always find cheap new or old used CD cases for them.  Also, I believe there's only one bonus feature on this set that's not on mine, and that was not worth the significant price difference.  In fact, I think there are one or two bonus features on the individual DVDs that aren't included in this set.  I just couldn't bear to give anything \\"Sex and the City\\" anything less than five stars.  Let's just hope the forthcoming movie lives up to this brilliant series.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|After listening to this CD for 3 straight days now, I wanted to like this CD.... but the Boss is the boss no more.    I used to buy his stuff unseen for 20+ years, because like Dylan he was a poet, a master of the craft of songwriting.  Singer and player, he never was much of one, but he was all about the song and the vibe.  I used to tell aspiring songwriters to buy his CD's even if they did not like him just to see how he crafted words into aural paintings and sonic flowers.    Yes, like a lot of people here, I complain of the horrible mastering of this CD (apparently it was mixed for IPOD, where are the dynamics?), Max's drums sound dulland buried, Little Steven's guitar work is obscured by countless other tracks competing for the same frequency range.  After taking this CD to my Sydec/SSL Soundscape and I quickly see virtually no waveforms on all the louder songs.  Confirmed, NO DYNAMICS! It seems Brenden's affection for the limiter/compression plugins on Pro Tools were designed for 2 dollar IPOD headphones.  But I will get by Brenden's complete massacre of the sound.  Can you tell I am not a fan of his, after all look at his work, he has ruined every band he has done.   I fail to hear the room at Southern Tracks in the mixes.    Where in the hades is Clarence?????  As I search my memory of the songs, I can think of two moments where I even HEARD him.  Sad to think that THE MAGIC of the Sax, Clarence's sax, is not even burned into my memory.  To compare this record as the best since \\"...USA\\" is make one's musical tastes get thrown up with last nights Varsity's chili dogs (sorry Atlanta).    THE BOSS has ripped off himself and others on this CD.  Yes there are some clever lines that do exist, But muscially there is NOTHING new here.  NOTHING!!!!!  Nothing to make me think, \\"WOW he did it!  He pulled one from out of nowhere and made the music world fresh, new, exciting, cool.\\"  Nope, I when I hear \\"Gypsy\\" at low level, I hear U2's \\"God's Country\\",  \\"Magic\\" is a blantant rip off of a Eric Clapton, who's ripped of the JJ Cale (at least Eric gives him JJ credit for his songs and style influence).  I have heard so many JJ Cale's songs that shred this song to bytes on my IPOD. On \\"Livin in the future\\", he just rips his own song off that he did on \\"...USA\\" and \\"The Rising\\".  And it justs goes on... and on.  Nothin new under the Bruce sun.    The hidden track is the best song, because it was raw and emotional...human.    I will not even get into the political overtones he has sunk into.  Hey Bruce, get back to life and love and stay off politics.  (I am just wonderin when are these artist/hollywood types going to realize that the socialized world/Bush hating disease of Hillary Clinton is going to turn the US into another Soviet Union, where there was NO artistic freedom.  Careful of what you wish for....Yes, sure Russia was a world leader of the arts for centuries, but once Lenin came along it ALL died and still is.  But that is another review altogether.    Overall, this album fails to compare to \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Human Touch\\" and to compare it Born in the USA is nothing short of total unpatriotic BRUCE.  I miss the BOSS, I miss \\"Born in the USA\\", \\"Born to Run\\", \\"57 channels\\"  (come on now who can not admit when they heard this song they thought 'WAY, WAY COOL.  WAY!!!!'), \\"Walk like a Man\\", \\"Nebraska\\", \\"Used Cars\\".      I am just wondering what is Clemons going to do on this tour?  Nils where are you?   Max please take out the picolo snare so I can hear some dynamics!!!  Brenden lose the compressor plugin!   Gosh, I hope Toby Scott is going to mix the live show, if not, I am not buying tickets!!!

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|This cd sounds the same all the way through.  It sounds like a robot singing.  Its unoriginal, boring and a complete waste of money!If I have to say any of these tracks are half way good it would be \\"Heaven ON Earth\\" or \\"Gimme More\\"  and really thats not saying much.This cd is being compared to Justin Timberlake's cd.  Its NOTHING like his cd!  His cd has rhyhmn and is about something.  This cd is nothing but computers and robots.  Complete garbage!
0718149912|3.0|When I heard that Victoria Beckham was publishing a style guide I was curious. I'm not a fan, but I don't have anything against her either.<br /><br />Having now read it (it took a day) I'm still a bit undecided. `That Extra Half an Inch' is written in a cosy style - it's like you're having a cup of coffee with Mrs Beckham. The book is nicely set into different sections; Tops, Day Dresses, Gifts (a lovely idea), make-up (disappointing) etc. And the photos are really stunning.<br /><br />That said I didn't actually learn anything new. This book is mostly a higher end where-to-buy guide. Come on - are all of the designer names Vic drops really useful to the average person on the street? Are our husbands going to whisk us off to Paris and New York for shopping? (Even if they did have the money I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you).<br /><br />Also, I think the book is sponsored by Top Shop; I lost count of the number of times the shop name cropped up. We can go to Gucci or Topshop, Fendi or Topshop, and so forth. She knows the name of a high street store, we get it; Vicky's one of us!!<br /><br />I'm really conflicted in my view. A lovely, if impractical, style guide. I would get another book, if one was ever published, just because of the nice, intimate writing style.
B00005JPFH|3.0|It's no secret that Spider-Man 3 is a disappointing entry in the feature film franchise of Marvel's web-crawling superstar.  That being said, what we have here is a pretty solid superhero story that does as much right as it does wrong, and could have been so much better than what it is.  As the story picks up, Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are together and happy, which soon gets spoiled upon the arrival of new villain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is the real man responsible for Uncle Ben's death.  Not to mention the fact that a gooey, alien symbiote has latched itself onto Peter, and has allowed for all his inhibitions to get left at the door as he embraces his dark side.  The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that there are too many characters in the story.  Sure, it's nice to see Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the movie, but she's here for little reason really.  What is also disappointing is having Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) here as well.  Arguably the most hyped about aspect of the film upon it's release, Brock's character development is non-sensical, and while his transformation into Venom and usage in the climactic final battle are plenty good, he's just not here enough.  James Franco's turn as Harry/New Goblin is also quite underdeveloped, although when he's bad, he's good.  Despite the negatives, there is a lot to admire here, mainly Maguire's gleeful turn as the \\"bad\\" Peter Parker (with an emo haircut), and he is clearly having a blast doing it.  Stan Lee's cameo is the best the legendary creator has had in a Marvel movie yet, and Bruce Campbell once again pops up in a cameo, and provides some nice laughs.  The CGI effects are wonderful, and director Sam Raimi knows what he's doing, but it just feels like he wanted to do too much with too little time.  All in all, Spider-Man 3 isn't bad one bit, and you can certainly do much worse when it comes to mega budget superhero movies, but at the end of the day, the film proves sadly disappointing.s sadly disappointing.

B000000W5H|3.0|After the undeniable brilliance of 69-72 era Stones albums like \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile On Main St.\\", this album began the inevitable retreat from the demons that were needed to create the aforementioned masterpieces.  Gone were songs of real pain like \\"Sister Morphine\\" or real demonic alliance like \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\".    On \\"IOR'NR\\" The Stones begin to fall into the creative pit by singing about being Rock Stars! This is not an underrated album. This is an album that starts the slide.  Afterwards we get \\"Black & Blue\\", a patronizing nod towards music that just happens to be written by black performers.  Only limeys could get away with that one. \\"Hey! let's do an album by all black guys!\\" Darling English fop, you've been doing that your whole career.  Then \\"Some Girls\\" came along.  After that The Rolling Stones were abducted by aliens and the dopllegangers that replaced them couldn't write a great rock song if you threatened to withhold their royalty check.   Bottom line, Mick was more interested in going to Disco's at this time with Bianca. Keith was realizing his years of substance abuse were not going to stop plaguing him.  And Mick taylor decided to exit stage right after receiving not an ounce of respect for his contributions to the Boys. He just was never one of them.  \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\".  Sounds like an excuse doesn't it?

Stylish backdrops, stunning costumes and eye-catching dancers provide a feast for the eyes, nearly distracting viewers from the lady herself.<br /><br />24 of her most loved singles from PWL, deconstruction and Parlapone, plus what is probably most fans favourite non-single track `Dreams'. And, in case this isn't enough, there are also covers of Judy Garland's immortal classic `Over The Rainbow', and what was originally a duet with The Pet Shop Boys; `In Denial'.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to go to 2 shows, and I admit I was surprised by the strength of her voice - she really can hit the high notes. Just wait to you hear `Confide In Me' and `Over The Rainbow'.<br /><br />I have to admit my favourites were the classic PWL hits, all our favourites are here: `Better The Devil You Know', `Shocked', `What Do I Have To Do', `Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi', `Hand On Your Heart', `Locomotion', `I Should Be So Lucky' and `Especially For You'.<br /><br />Another stand out number is `I Believe In You'; it really took my breath away - just superb! `Come Into My World', `Put Yourself In My Place', `Chocolate' and `On A Night Like This' are all hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Then there's Kylie's current, and most popular Parlapone sound. `In Your Eyes', `Giving You Up', `Spinning Around', `Red Blooded Woman' (Medley with `Where The Wild Roses Grow'), `Slow', `Please Stay', `Your Disco Needs You', `Can't Get You Out Of My Head' and `Love At First Sight' all passionately sung by our favourite pop princess!<br /><br />* And don't forget the extras: a backstage documentary, screen visuals and ROM section for your computer, so you can download screen savers and wallpapers.

B000V6BE6C|2.0|I am a big fan of Avenged Sevenfold. I have listened to them since Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was released and I must say, I NEVER expected them to make a CD that sounded like this. I mean, I love when bands take risks and do things differently, and lets face it, I'm sure many people would be angry if they released \\"City of Evil 2,\\" but after listening to this self-titled album three times now, I must say, \\"City of Evil 2\\" isn't sounding too bad. It's not that this CD is absolutely horrible, because it is extremely catchy, the band just lost something important in the process...the heavy metal part. Don't get me wrong, the metal is in these songs in certain places, and the guitar work, which has always been outstanding, is still there. It's just that this CD has too many odd points in it. The sort of country guitar intro to \\"Gunslinger\\" and the slide guitar in \\"Dear God,\\" I have no problem with, it actually sounds pretty good and fits the songs. But that thing Cher uses on her voice in her one single, does NOT belong in metal. When I heard that effect used on M. Shadows voice in the song \\"Lost,\\" I was floored. But even that is forgiveable if odd things like that happen only once or twice on the CD. But EVERY song has something weird in it, that made me scratch my head and think to myself, \\"What the hell were they thinking?!\\" I gave it two stars because the album has some really good songs on it. The first two tracks are incredible, but the album just becomes weirder and weirder from that point on, all the way until it reaches its apex of \\"What the hell is going on?!\\" on the track titled, \\"A Little Piece of Heaven,\\" which is one of the weirderst songs I have ever heard in my life. Whether you are a long time fan or a new interested fan, though the album must be heard to be believed, I cannot bring myself to recommend taking the risk. As a big A7X fan, I can say that I was very dissappointed with the album. Can't wait to watch the DVD to see what was going through their minds when making this album. If this is the future of Avenged Sevenfold, then, sadly I must say, I will not be on board anymore. I loved the past albums, but this one can only be described as average at best. If you are still planning on buying the album, the only I can say is to lower your expectations...maybe then you can enjoy the album a bit more. Thank you for reading this review and I hope that I could help a bit in your decision on whether or not to buy the album.heir minds when making this album.

B000WQ9UA8|2.0|I just finished reading ( and writing ) a couple Nick Cave & Joy Division reviews here on amazon. I popped over to Britney because my six year old niece is a fan and we listened to  a single on the Internet.  I forget what it was called ( Gimme something maybe, but it wasn't shelter, which the poor girl seems to need ) but it had something to do with what I'd rather my angelic niece not ask about yet.  What struck me is the difference of language use in the former bands' reviews and Britney's. And language, thought, inspiration really have nothing to do with this type of product. But it will sell.  \\"Saw IV\\" is the #1 movie at the box office right now.  \\"Control\\" will probably open and close stuck in limited release.  That's America kids. This is product driven by corporations like Disney. Am I saying Britney Spear's is not thinking persons' music?  Yes I am. Does it matter?  Not to you if you buy this stuff.  I can only hope you meet someone who exposes you to great music someday.  It's never too late.

B000093FLA|4.0|Just watched \\"Snatch\\" again last night only a few days after hooting over unanimously negative reviews of \\"Swept Away\\", director Guy Ritchie's crap vehicle for his wife.  Man I hope that boy's career isn't ruined.  \\"Snatch\\" and it's predecessor \\"Lock, Stock...\\" were the two best English Tarantino inspired crime films.   Brad Pitt's transformation into a tattooed, Irish \\"pikey\\" ( gypsy ) is the highlight of the film.  The DVD includes subtitles when Pitt and his gypsy brothers speak their unintelligible dialogue, which is simply wonderful.  \\"Do ya like degs?\\" Englishman, \\"Heh?\\" \\"Do ye like degs!?\\" \\"Oh dogs. Yeah, I like dogs.\\" Good stuff indeed.   The slow-mo fight scenes with Pitt's character are almost as good as the fight scenes in \\"Raging Bull\\" which says a lot.  Guy, we loved you when you made \\"Lock, Stock...\\" and \\"Snatch\\".  We understand you were p-ssy whipped when you made \\"Swept Away\\".

B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Unfortunately for the current future of mankind, we humans (and particularly, we Americans) find ourselves in a particularly regressive state.  We would rather watch a plethora of reality shows than CNN, we want superficial movies with talentless-to-only-somewhat-talented actors and actresses, we seem to find it perfectly acceptable that athletes and glossy Hollywood types get paid millions per year while teachers and scientists are often struggling to get by, and we mindlessly accept pretty-packaged musical atrocities as art.  Whomever first described the musical fare in the vein of Britney Spears as \\"sugary\\" was absolutely correct.  To the passive listener, Britney's music tastes good going down, but is ultimately not only of no value to the body, it is actually harmful.    From her first album until now, Britney has been the poster child for all the popular music cash cows that the greedy record executives anxiously sign to their labels.  The philosophy is simple:  make as much money possible by any means necessary.  To do this, songwriters and producers are brought in to provide serious support to the usually barely-talented (if at all) \\"artist\\".  The most financially-rewarding demographic has demonstrated in their buying habits that they don't want lyrics that make them have to think, they like sexual content (whether explicit or implicit), and they like catchy melodies and harmonies.  Thus, the artist doesn't need to have even decent vocal ability.  What is commonly referred to as \\"auto-tune\\" will make sure no off-puttingly wrong notes are hit, songwriters will write tepid lyrics (usually representative of immature modes of thinking), and producers will create the vocal melodies and accompaniment (or what is simply referred to as \\"beats\\" in the popular culture) that are easy to remember (and, oftentimes, easy to dance to).  All of this serves to hook the *passive* listener on the music, which can result in any combination of album, ticket, perfume/cologne, toy, and clothing line sales.    Most music reviewers are proving that they really have no authority to be ranking albums, as they seem to be unable to tell just how terrible Britney's music is.  I have already seen some far too optimistic reviews given to this album by critics, while the few truly artistically-impressive albums coming out are getting reviews that are just blatantly insulting when compared to those of \\"artists\\" like Britney.  What seems to be impressing the critics is the production on the album.  Sadly, the production is often credited to the performer when it should really be credited to the producers.  Britney has certainly acquired an astonishing amount of money by now, and she brought in \\"it\\" producers who be able to carry her album for her.  However, despite the constant criticism of her terrible vocal abilities (and probably terrible aural skills, although we can't be sure of that, since she continues to lip synch in her performances), Britney has demonstrated her infamous ignorance yet again and has STILL hasn't pursued serious vocal training to improve the quality of her singing.  On top of that, her lyrics are still terribly lacking in creativity, uninspiring, and simply immature (and sadly, she had to pay people to write them for her because hers would be even worse).    Based on the other new releases for this week that I have seen, as well as the ridiculous amount of news coverage this album is getting (due to Britney's other parts of her life that she is also insanely ineffective at managing), I expect this album to debut at #1 on the Billboard album sales chart next week.  However, that doesn't mean that my message will have been for nothing if I can convince even one person who is thinking about buying this album from doing so.  We human beings are supposed to be progressive thinkers, as we are the most cognitively-advanced creatures on this planet.  Music is art, and we deserve better than this as our art.  We deserve for high-qualitymusic to once again be the \\"popular music\\" of our culture.  We have the power to decide what the record labels feed us, and one way to do that is to refuse to give them our money when they try to feed us this \\"sugary\\" music.  We have to regain control.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|Earlier commentators have quite rightly praised the excellence of the technical quality in this film's transfer to DVD and the general distinction as well of the included special features. Outstanding among the latter is the insightful discussion of the film not only in the usual context of its homage to Hollywood noir but of its not so readily recognized role as an art work in the lengthy tradition of \\"the international theme,\\" that of the naive young American girl adrift among money-hungry Europeans, a favorite of numerous artists since Henry James' \\"Daisy Miller.\\"    \\"Breathless,\\" it's true, has always been rightly understood as a tribute to Monogram Pictures, B movies, and Bogie, but it is equally illuminating to see it as a satirically meaningful interaction between a psychotic, though charming, evil European and a presumably naive, though even more lethal, American girl. Henry James predicted in despair that the American girl of the future would know \\"little of mystery, and even less of manners.\\" In confirmation of his prediction,, we have in this film the American girl in the person of the deadly careerist, ultimate betrayer Patricia, seller of the New York Herald Tribune, speaker of grotesquely pronounced French, herself a species of unwitting last Mohican, the reductio ad absurdam in fact of the presumably innocent American encountering the presumably wicked European. The film \\"Breathless, thus, is much more than a piece of meaningless \\"existential\\" viciousness celebrating the merits of film noir. It is rife with more literary and cultural resonance - to wit, the clever yet moving arrival at rock bottom of an old tradition - than is usually acknowledged.

B000002MUN|5.0|What an album!!! This is undoubtedly one of the best albums ever made. The genius is in the simplicity. And not everyone can make a masterpiece with simplicity but Tom Petty did and it just pierced my soul when I heard it. When listening to these songs you can't help but think about your life and the good times and bad times you've had. Love and broken hearts, successes and broken dreams, and just living life in America. It's all here. I am particularly mesmorized by the haunting strings on the last part of It's Good to be King - one of the most beautiful songs I have ever had the pleasure of getting to hear. Thank you Tom Petty.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|This movie is definitely not for guys.  It's a sappy story with pretty boys for women looking for an adventure story and for little boys that will get more mileage out of playing with the action heros.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Listening to the new Britney Spears record is an experience indeed - despite the obvious hooks, the singalong choruses, and the perfectly times beats, there also lies a certain depth and soul that was sorely missing on all her previous albums. Yes, the songs are good (just ask any critic), but what makes this album special is its tremendous replay value (I suggest you buy a physical copy of the CD), and the intricate attention to the production. Unlike other reviewers, I have to give credit for Britney's vocal ability as well - she is not the best singer, but one listen to her on tracks such as \\"Heaven on Earth\\", and you realize why it is that she is still so endearing.<br /><br />Whats even more astonishing is Spears' ability to remain culturally and sociologically relevant in an era that has virtually wiped out all of her classmates from the late 1990s. Though I do respect Christina Aguilera and her recent \\"Back to Basics\\" album, I have already played \\"Blackout\\" more than I have that other album. That's a testament to what Britney is - it may be disposable, it may be too commercial, but through it all it remains relevant and addictive. You can't deny that, and if you're new to the circus, I would recommend that you pick this album up as soon as possible.<br /><br />\\"Blackout\\"'s strengths (and there are many) - is that every song on this 12-track album could be a successful radio single. I cannot think of another album in the last ten years that I could say this about. Even if you're not a fan of the generic pop genre, you will find something here to love. Primary single \\"Gimme More\\" (which rates alongside \\"Toxic\\" as Britney's best single ever) is just the beginning of the brilliance. To give you an idea of the multiple genres that Britney has employed on this record, let me compare some of the songs to the artists they most closely resemble. You can base your opinions on this, if you like:<br /><br />\\"Piece of Me\\" : Many call this the standout track of the album. I think its pretty great, but not a Britney classic. The production her is very `Neptunes', and the track itself is very reminiscent of something that came out of the UK Underground club scene. Great repeat value, and the rooster instrumental effects, coupled with the very singable chorus will guarantee that this is a track you will be playing a lot in the days to come.<br /><br />\\"Heaven on Earth\\" - Easily the best track on the record. This is 1980s electro-pop goodness. I would go so far as saying that this one track is better than anything on the new Hilary Duff record (\\"Dignity\\" - where Hilary tried to channel the `80s as well). Why is this song special. Well, for starters, it mixes electronic pop with ambient trance, and layers it with a synthesized Eurythmics sensibility. Think an Annie Lennox song done by Kylie Minogue, with DJ Tiesto as the producer. This is that track. I love the vocals on this - frail, tender, vulnerable. The song is undeniably sexy, and one that I will hail as the one of the best of Spears' career. And the line \\"Waking up, with you next to me\\" sound eerily like Imogen Heap!<br /><br />\\"Toy Soldier\\" - What production! The opening beats alone deserve to be played loud on your car stereo system. This is the jam she was born to make. The highly digitized vocals only enhance the overall effect of the track. Yet another song that you will have on repeat. The companion track to this is \\"Freakshow\\", which to me is not as memorable as this one, but still as good.<br /><br />\\"Break The Ice\\" - Remember how Janet Jackson always brought the best track on her album as the album opener? Well, I only wish they had chosen this song to open the album - it so deserved to be Track 1. Its tailor made for radio - listening to it now, it seems to marry the best of the R&B and Hip-Hop genre, and infuses it with a very pop sound overall. A universally acclaimed track, this is the perfect foil for \\"Gimme More\\".<br /><br />\\"Why Should I be Sad\\" - Justin Timberlakecould only wish he made such a Timbalandesque jam on his last album. This is the slowest track on the record, but with a very poignant vocal from Britney. Production is stellar, and it's a superb closer to an already superb album. I highly recommend listening to this on headphones to truly appreciate it. It speaks of her marriage, divorce, and relationship issues, but she doesn't position herself as a victim - just as an observer, and I found this very classy.<br /><br />Standout tracks include \\"Radar\\", and of course the much-maligned \\"Hot As Ice\\". Many people call the last track the worst on the CD. Granted, its not that great, but if you take it with a sense of humor, you will actually start to like it. The background vocals and singers sound like they're channeling the Oompa Loompas from \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" - listen to it to see what I mean!<br /><br />The only downside to this album, is that its too short. Some of the best tracks that Britney recorded from the era (And available on the net in various avatars) are missing from this. My absolute favorite from this Era is the unreleased track \\"Sugarfall\\", which easily is one of the best songs Spears has ever recorded. Two ballads remain missing - \\"Baby Boy\\" and \\"Let Go\\" (the latter shows off Spears' vocal training to full effect). Another winner, \\"Get Back\\" is possibly the song that should be immediately released as a single (what a chorus!) for for inexplicable reasons was left off the CD entirely. Heres the thing - there are at least 30 songs floating around that Britney made for \\"Blackout\\", but only 12 made it here. My guess is that some of these will surface at some point on some foreign editions of the CD. Please do look out for them - they are totally worth it.<br /><br />So what would I compare this album to. Well, in terms of the groundbreaking genre and production, there are quite a few peers. If you liked this album, you would love \\"Neon Nights\\" by Dannii Minogue, \\"Come and Get it\\" by Rachel Stevens, \\"Ray of Light\\" by Madonna - but the truth is, there hasn't been an album quite like this before. It breaks new ground with every track, and there is literally something for everybody. Just when you think the songs getting repetitive, theres an electronica solo much like Imogen Heap that blows your mind, and traces of Eurythmics, Duran Duran, Modern Talking, A Ha, and even Debbie Gibson are found throughout this album. Is this a good thing? Yes it is! If anything, you cannot possibly be bored by this album.<br /><br />Britney Spears making a classic album was considered an impossibility a few months or years ago. But with a great team behind her, she has finally achieved what she set out to. I'm no defender of her personal life, nor a huge Britney fan, but I do know likable and essential pop music when I listen to it. This review is for her new album, not her personal life. And that said, this is easily the best pop release of the year, and the finest of Spears' career. I would say - forget the person and concentrate on the music. Even if you remove Spears' persona completely from this record, its still a masterpiece of the pop-electronica genre, and you can't deny that.<br /><br />Five Stars.

6304712936|5.0|The greatest value of this wonderful, albeit somewhat flawed movie (due to some of its major historical inaccuracies), is that it may induce those who are not aware of Mozart's timelessly beautiful operas (especially those written during his golden years, 1781-1791) to give them a serious look.<br /><br />The whole movie is very enjoyable to watch.  F. Murray Abraham was great in the role of Antonio Salieri.
B00004SA86|4.0|First off, this is a very good cycle and, at the time of its release, and important one. At a time when there were few choices for Mahler, either Bernsteins emotionally global view or solti insanity, it was refreshing to hear a more straightforward, fleeter, and classically restrained approach-that adhered to the letter of the score much more closely than the aforementioned podium stars. BUt now, with a plethora of Mahler cycles on the market, those virtues are not as singular as they once were and have been surpassed while Bernsteins still represents a rare insight into the subjective world of Mahler and consequently never before has Mahler been so successfully emotionally riveting.<br />I would recomennd this for enthusiasts so that they can experience this Mahler. I prefer it to Boulez. It has all of Boulez' details yet none of the chilling separatism that is the hallmark of much of his non-modern recordings or interps(with the exception of the sixth.) each of their firsts are wonderful, though Kubeliks is and will probably remain for sometime the standard for such a work-In Kubeliks first,classical refinement meets youthful exuberence. This is Kubelik, and Mahler's Titan, at its best.<br />As far as the rest goes, the seventh is still one of the reference versions(though no one seems to care about the seventh anyway despite the fact it is one of Mahlers most ingenius scores and one of my three favourite symphonys from his pen-This symphony is a clear example of Boulez shortcomings)<br />The eighth is also wonderful and i can still recall my first encounter with it on vinyl-perhaps the moment I fell in love with Mahler in the first place.<br />His fourth is perceptive and cheery, perhaps lacking the ultimate profundity of the final moments-some of the most inspired in all mahler. His fifth is very good. His sixth is a mixed bag and the andante is one of the few failures of the cycle.<br />Either way, in a time when we have extraordinary cycles for Gielen on Hansler, which is the finest overall cycle ever recorded, and Bernsteins Sony\CBS and DG still haunting the classical section, and Rattles new released cycle, and lets not forget Chailly recent RCO cycle, there seems to be new masterful interpretations every few months almost. Of the past, few remain defintive. I wouldnt want to be without Walter's 1,2,4, or 9. Or Ancerl's 9. Or Karajan 5,6, or 9. Of them all though, Bernstein's appraoch remains as unique and awe-inspiring as it did when it was released and at least on an emotional level, will never be surpassed.<br />Below is a list of my definitive mahler recordings<br />1.

0670034711|4.0|I read Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love a couple weeks ago. Which I was enjoying immensely until I saw her on Oprah. This is not to say that I was disappointed by anything she said or who the live person was, that was quite the contrary. It was just the fact that she was on Oprah that bugged. I know the book is a national bestseller, but still, when I was reading it, I couldn't help but feel like she wrote this book for me and a few others in some kind of \\"I want to find God but, be myself too, club.\\"     But the fact that she was on Oprah with the audience all having read the book, nodding in all their enthusiasm as Oprah reads paragraphs from the sacred text was just indicative of how popular Gilbert and her book had become. And to me, always seemingly the black sheep in any herd I run, couldn't stomach the book's popularity. I didn't want to finish reading it. In fact it took me a couple days to pick it up again.     But, I trudged on. I was not disappointed. Gilbert is so authentic in her writing. It's touching, not in a sentimental way, but in an inspiring, \\"I want to connect with the divine\\" kind of way that makes it feel doable when it's not coming from a monk, a priest, a guru, or evangelical tent revival leader, but a 30-something confused divorcee who really likes pasta and men. Oh, this is why she's popular. It's her accessibility and generousity of spirit. I guess I'll have to share her.     Although in some ways, I was envious, and could not relate (because having a husband,  a child, and being pregnant, kind of gets in the way of my own quest to globe trot and soul search), I did find a nugget of insight to pocket. And that is that praying is talking to God wheras meditating is listening to God. A simple concept, but said in way, from perhaps the right person, that made sense to me and dmystified cross-legged skinny people chanting \\"om.\\" So, it inspired me to spend more time listening to God, the divine, Spirit, the collective unconscious, or whateveryou want to call him or her, because all of these weary pleas of \\"Dear Lord, help me get through another trying day,\\" isn't nourishing my soul.    -Kim  [...]
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I love it!  Bruce goes back to the E Street sound.  I'm a pretty big fan and there isn't much Springsteen I don't like, but this one's Bruce at his best.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|As a long time Britney Spears fan, I'm glad to say that musically she's back.  Anyone who enjoys her past CDs should enjoy this one also. It's no comeback, just yet. It may take a while and a lot of effort from her to get a comeback from her.  Just about all the songs are kind of \\"robotic\\", but the music has that sound to it. My ONLY disappointment was \\"Hot As Ice\\" being slowed down and edited. Despite all of the media, and everything that revolves around her, she'll come back. I have full support of Britney, and there's no reason for me not to. I'm 17 and I still love Britney Spears, I'm happy to admit that.    Blackout is addicting. Before it even came out, most people heard all the songs. I personally listened to them ALL the time. And there's a reason why, it's amazing. She doesn't have the best singing voice compared to others, but the music is just amazing like any other CD she made.    I suggest you at least download a few songs and get a feel for it, or just go out and buy it. You won't regret it.
B0002IQNAG|2.0|This movie is silly. It's often boring, while the gore is comic, the zombies are as blue as smurfs and there isn't a scary moment in it. I totally recommend Night of the Living Dead, which is a quintessential horror film that is effectively creepy... Dawn of the Dead is just camp.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I've loved a lot of the movies they've chosen to come out in platinum editions, and this one was no exception.  This is an amazing movie!  I could share it with my niece and nephew and relive a slice of my childhood.  Hopefully Disney keeps picking out their treasures.
B000002U9L|4.0|I picked this up because Labyrinth is my favorite movie. This may end up being my favorite soundtrack. All of the songs are there, but not as you may thing. The dialogue on \\"Magic Dance\\" is not the same as the movie, and you get the full \\"Chilly Down\\" as opposed to what was presented in the film. A good companion to the movie.
B00009W0U4|4.0|I`ve been waiting to see this 2002 movie for a long time.  Several of my Amazon friends have seen it and warned me of its brutal contents, but I had to see for myself.  Since it is a foreign film, save yourself some time and order it here at Amazon, because your local store probably won't carry it.<br /><br />The movie is told in reverse.  I had a beer before I saw this and actually thought I was feeling it when the credits came on.  No, it wasn't that, the filmmaker had decided to portray it with very unique camera angles.  I was impressed to say the least.  This film audio portion is in French and it's subtitled English.  I do speak French and was surprised to find that many times the subtitles did not really match what the actors were actually saying.  I think, they were trying to shorten the dialogue up so you could read faster.<br /><br />In essence what happens is that a beautiful girl, Alex  (Monica Bellucci) is dating this carefree and party loving, immature guy, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), who can't seem to grow up---wait a minute, isn't that most men?  They are going to a party with a mutual friend (her ex-boyfriend), Pierre.  Pierre is supposed to drive them, but his car breaks down and he phones Alex and Marcus to tell them they will take the subway together.  Marcus snorts a little coke and his party antics make Alex upset.  She leaves the party and said she's walking home alone, despite Pierre's insistence that she wait and they go home together.  A streetwalker, tells Alex to take the underpass \\"it's safer\\" when she tries to cross the busy street.  She heeds the advice and gets brutally raped.  What made it more disturbing was a man enters the tunnel, observes what is happening and turns around and walks away, wow, how heartless!  Marcus then drags Pierre into seeking revenge and they meet a man who does just that for money.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this movie, it is quite disturbing.  However, I found myself thinking about this film over and over again right after I viewed it.  It wasn't that it was so brutal that I felt sorry for the victims, it was the message the film was trying to convey.  I believe that the filmmaker was trying to show how short life is and that we never know when something tragic will happen to those we love.  The title, Irreversible, says it to me.  We can't go back in time and change the bad things that happen in life.  I got a very strong message from this, and that is to show the people you love that you do care about them and tell them before it's too late.<br /><br />This is definitely not a \\"chick flick\\" or for the faint at heart, but the message is much stronger than your classic rape and revenge horror flicks and is much deeper.  The movie is well acted and photographed.  If your into the extreme this is for you, with a deep, deep message.wed it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|How did I miss this completely in 2003?    If the movie hadn't come to cable, and I hadn't been surfing channels one day, I would have never found this gem.  At first I wasn't sure it was going to work... guns... space... western...  however, it did.  I found myself wanting more.  I bought the box set and watched the whole thing in three days.  Now, I'm still left wanting more....  Definately worth the purchase in my book.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This new one replaces the HP 12C that I purchased 25 years.  That one still works; I have two homes and needed one at each.  My HP 12C is like an old friend.  I don't know how I could have made it in business without it.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|You can tell that Robert DeNiro really cares about what he's telling us here...probably too much so.  A little more objectivity and a much better film might have emerged.      The spy game and its corroding effects on the human psyche are much better told by LeCarre.  Still it's a good theme and worth exploring.  There's just too much crammed in here and as much as I cared to follow the intricacies of the plot after while I lost interest.  I think DeNiro had to chose which of the two plots to focus on - the spy plot or the human drama; he tried for too much and as a result people just get tired of watching and lose interest.      The cast is stellar and they all do heroic jobs.  I usually love Matt Damon and I don't fault him for the less-than-fascinating performance.  He was undoubtably told to play \\"cold\\" and \\"emotionally detached\\" and he gave us that for two hours and forty some minutes.  I think that the development, or devolution of his character would have been much more interesting if we had seen more of the younger, livelier man, who gradually hardened into stone.  The most interesting parts of the film were his brief love scenes with the two hearing impaired women.      Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job but I think she was miscast.  She was far too exotically beautiful to play a girl whom Damon would so easily ignore.      As other reviewers here have mentioned, there are certainly some cliches indulged in...There's no guessing what DeNiro thinks about WASP culture...gee, are they all as bad as that?!!      The film isn't awful, as Hollywood films go, but I suggest that anyone really interested in the genre to skip this and re-watch the LeCarre films.
B000PHX8C0|4.0|After being ridiculed by a friend of mine for not owning this album I went out and bought it. I listened to it for a few days exclusively for about three days or so.    In soaking in Devil Driver's latest album I have to say that there are some good songs (Not All Who Wander Are Lost and These Fighting Words) but the majority of the album is repetitive and drags on a bit in places.    The songs are well paced, pushed forward by John Boecklin's hammering drum work. Guitars are heavy and fast as well, just without a lot of breakdowns or speed changes. There are some, but as fast and as deep and grungy as the album sounds, it gets old.    These Fighting Words, in my opinion, shows where the strength of this band lies. Its a borderline catchy song. The chorus will have your skin crawling with goose bumps and the two minute strong guitar focus (bordering on solo) will leave you breathless. Its just the right song to put in the middle of the album.    The final song, The Axe Shall Fall, shows off a softer side of the band and is another of the stronger songs present on this release. The ending of the song is a melodic touch to a very heavy and direct metal album.    I'm glad I bought this, I would suggest to anyone who is a fan of bands with a heavy and straight forward sound to pick this up. I am still exploring my tastes in metal so, if you like your metal without any frills, just a straight forward kick in the teeth, look no further.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Thank god they gave us something more to chew on.  I just saw serenity on cable, and then had to have \\"Firefly\\", and then had to have this.  It may not have a great deal new, but I'll take ANYTHING (Joss, FOX, I hope your listening)

Besides being interesting, this book cronicles an addicts use of every drug imaginable in a short period of time. If you have any kind of addiction, you can relate to this book.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|This is not a bad CD for what it's supposed to be, and that is a bunch of good beats with over processed vocals. But this shouldn't surprise anyone because every album she's put out has used catchy beats with subpar vocals. On this album she does what she's good at which is pretty much give the people who buy her music what they really want. \\"Gimme\\" is a good example and so are songs like \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Hot as Ice\\", and even the forgettable \\"Heaven on Earth\\". I wouldn't call this a comeback CD because it doesn't seem as if she is doing anything different than she did before. But I have to say most of the songs are dance worthy and the hooks, while not the best lyrics ever written, are still catchy and you'll find yourself singing along. The beats also help too. Lastly, I rate this 3 stars because most of the tracks don't explore new territory but are still fun to move to.

B000V6BE6C|3.0|Three CDs ago, Avenged Sevenfold woke the dead with a screaming Heavy Metal album called [[ASIN:B0000AGWJ7 Waking the Fallen]]. In 2005 they put out a much more melodic Metal album with [[ASIN:B0009I7NNA City of Evil]], and I'd argue that City was the best Rock release of that year.<br /><br />This year we get A7X's self titled, self produced disk. And anyone that was a big fan of Waking the Fallen will be 'gravely' disappointed. If you liked City of Evil, this disk is more on par with that, but this disk lacks the abundance of stand-out tracks that City had.<br /><br />This self titled disk starts out with a big F-U to anyone that doesn't support the war in Iraq, and that's risky business for an entertainment entity whose sales may have once been comprised of a lot of the people that are being given (to put it lightly) the Bronx Cheer in the song Critical Acclaim.<br /><br />The second song is the only song even close to the A7X of Waking the Fallen (and the earlier years). Scream (track 3), Afterlife (track 4) and Unbound (track 6) are most reminiscent of the melodic rockers that densely populated City of Evil. And the most interesting composition...and I do mean composition...is A Little Piece of Heaven; it's an operatic, carnival-esque, strange, spooky song. There are also a couple of ballads and one song that's called Lost that's just...well...lost on this CD with its electric vocalizations.<br /><br />Unlike City of Evil where each song was over 5 minutes long, almost every song on this 10 track disk is under or right at the 5 minute mark (with the exception of the last two tracks).<br /><br />All of the songs are clearly sung by Shadows. The music is hard. There's spectacular drumming by TheRev. There's head banging, melodic, Iron Maiden-ish guitar solos and driving bass. But as I said earlier, none of the 10 tracks immediately jump out at you.<br /><br />While City of Evil brought a refreshing, somewhat newish sound to Metal fans, A7X's Avenged Sevenfold is a step backwards...not bad...but definitely a step backwards. Sorry fans.<br /><br />Edit 12/27/2009 - RIP James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan. Rock the Heavens with Dimebag and Davey Williams!ep backwards. Sorry fans.    Edit 12/27/2009 - RIP James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan. Rock the Heavens with Dimebag and Davey Williams!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|this show is absolutely hilarious.  it depicts the lives of 5 late 20-something individuals and how they interact as unconditional best friends as well as people searching for love.  the humor is legendary, the plots original, and if you want to laugh for 30 minutes straight, watch an episode.  i guarantee you'll hook your friends on this series, and you will all be quoting or referencing this show, because our lives today are very similar.  if you have only 1 show to choose for your viewing pleasure, this is the one!  buy how i met your mother today!
B000UFAURI|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive in purchasing the entire cd subject to the 'fooies' reviews. Why compare it to past ventures? Compare it to what is out there and available in todays market. I love this cd and have had it on rotation for several weeks now with no sight of boredom. It starts with 'The Pretender', definitely foo fighter typical. The remainder of the cuts take you on a journey that maybe you didn't expect. It ends with 'Home' which is destined to be a classic in a 'Neil Young' kind of way. The cd rocks and then it makes you all warm and fuzzy. Nice balance.
B000EULJLU|5.0|this album, actually every album by tool, gets basically two reviews.  review one says, \\"it's emotional and profound and complex and totally awesome.\\"  review two says, \\"this is overhyped prog-garbage supported by mindless fanboys.\\"  i agree with both reviews.    part of me listens to songs like \\"wings for marie\\" and \\"right in two\\" and is just astounded by the depth of musical skill and amazing complexity and profound nature of the lyrics.  i am in awe of how talented this band is.  both musically and lyrically, they raise the bar.    but part of me listens to the album and just wants to throw my stereo out the window.  the songs are way too long, lengthened by pointless and boring musical interludes.  the lyrics at times strike me as hollow, as if maynard is just faking it.  and i wonder exactly why i listen to this band in the first place.    is it truly \\"deep\\" and \\"profound\\"?  or am i just judging the majority of the lyrics based on the best from aenima?  is it really that musically complex, or is the band just rehashing their sound from lateralus?  is this a band at the peak of their powers, or are they just repeating themselves?    the one real solid song is \\"the pot.\\"  most of the rest of the album is certainly listenable, but depending on my mood, i either love it or hate it.  sometimes i think its their best album, and sometimes i think its a hollow copy of lateralus.    so i agree with both types of reviews.  i probably should have given it three stars, since that would make it average.      but i gave it five, because even if tool is just repeating themselves, and maynard's lyrics are stupid and pretentious, and the band is nowhere near as good as the fanboys believe ... even if all that is true, tool is still ten times better than any band out there.  even a crappy tool album is an order of magnitude better than a brilliant album by some top ten band like nickelback.
B00006879E|4.0|I generally hate hyped up bands but Maroon 5 is a different story. This is a great album. It's got a ton of infectious hooks that you can't help but love. This album has everything from soul to funk to rock to pure pop. Adam Levine's voice is incredible, very unique.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have never purchased a Britney cd before or have been a huge fan but her song Gimme More got under my skin, so I bought her cd and it is one of the better ones released this year. It has a lot of upbeat dance tracks. Regardless of the paparazzi and tabloids and baby's daddy drama, the girl has talent. I wish her the best, it cant be easy living in the spotlight everytime you leave your house.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I've been a fan of their music since I was in highschool (alnost 6 years ago now)  I have to admit that I was a bit skepical, being that they were out of the music scene so long.  But I was glad that I bought the cd.  I love it!  I highly reccomend it for those of us that have been with them all along or new comers!  A great collection of songs!
B000H305U0|5.0|This is an excellent CD!!!  Every song on here is fabulous - if you get a chance watch the concert live on HBO !!  You'll love every minute of it!
B000P2A256|4.0|It's a little more gloomy than Songs about Jane, sort of a \\"break up album.\\" But Maroon 5 doesn't stray away from hooks that made their first album so enjoyable. It's not groundbreaking but still catchy as ever. You can't help but love it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Great concert DVD and gives you a real feel as to what his shows must be like live. We all loved it - including my 15 year old son who believe it or not has become a BIG Buble fan. It's certainly a concert DVD you'll watch more than once. Excellent!
B000T97SY8|5.0|This is by all means a fantastic album. If this is your first encounter with Primal Fear you will find power- heavy metal of the best quality from a band that has constantly been making superior records.<br />For the experienced fans in the ranks of Primal Fear this is as good as every other fear release. It is definitely one step ahead in the course that commenced through \\"Devil's Ground\\" (2004) and continued with \\"Seven Seals\\" (2005). Primal Fear progress by adding orchestral instruments in parts and female guest vocals by \\"Epica\\" lead singer Simone Simons. However, by playing the album one will come to understand that above all, this is a faithful reproduction of the established high- octane, razor-sharp Primal Fear style. You might not even notice the orchestral fills when hearing this album for the first time.<br /><br />Even the British press had to acknowledge the superiority of this release; Specifically \\"Power Play\\" magazine (issue 92) gives this item a 10/10, commenting \\"put simply, this is brilliant\\". In other words, it does not get any better than this, a perfect record and as you might know, one doesn't expect to come across this rating very often when it comes to British journalists.<br />\\"Classic rock\\" magazine (issue 112) which does not specialise in power/heavy metal marked this album with 7/10 commenting \\"(Primal fear have) gone mano a mano with Helloween with their fiercely technical, exuberantly overblown epics\\"<br /><br />Finally the album reached number 60 at the German charts, number 67 on the Swedish charts and number 37 on the Japanese charts. You will not regret investing on this remarkable album.
075640407X|5.0|Fantasy doesn't get any better than this.  The book is over 600 pages long and I started reading slower and slower towards the end, because I didn't want it to end.   Can not wait until the next one- get writing Patrick!!!    Comparison's are tough here, but the closest I can come is Tolkien.   The hero is incredible but very human and humble.   The world is complex, but I was drawn into it in the story versus  other books that give too much info in the beginning.   Good also seems to rule without piety.   Still this world is not as innocent as Tolkiens, it's got spice.  I also would not call it 'dark' fiction as bad things happen but life goes on to create good.    Loved it!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is absolutely fantastic.  I consider it to be very cheap for what you get.  It is jaw dropping incredible! beautiful!  Makes a fantastic gift.  I plan to give this as a gift for years and years to come. A must have!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I think this is her best album. Its so good!  My favorite songs on it are, Gimme More, Piece of Me, Break the Ice,   Get Naked, Toy Soldier, Hot As  Ice, Ooh Ooh Baby, Why Should I Be Sad.    Don't get me wrong, I love them all but those are my tops!   Britney's gone and blown me away. :)
B0006A9FKA|5.0|We wore out our first copy and we had to order a second one. Hillarious!!!
1881273989|4.0|As a retreat facilitator I am always looking for books to add to our library for both singles and couples. I found the couples kit by Gary Chapman and like it so I decided to purchase this book. This edition deals with how to communicate with anyone and offers tools and advice that anyone can use and understand.
0143038419|5.0|This book is so dynamic and rich.  Everything good said about this book I can only repeat.  Makes you giggle, feel compasionate and fulfilled!!
0156030306|3.0|Many people who had read Keyes' original novel called it \\"profound\\" and a \\"masterpiece.\\" It seems to be lacking in both of those areas. A lot of the characterization seemed a bit one dimensional, and when Charlie describes other people, he does so - even while newly intelligent - blandly and without depth. The author had a great amount of material to work with, and it's as if he decided to do nothing at all. In fact, more sympathy was given to the mouse, for whom the book is named, and who makes rare appearances in the text. If one is looking for something \\"profound,\\" look to the last twenty or so pages. There, Charlie makes a beautiful discovery - how sex remedies the selfishness of the rest of life. It is written quite well, and the final words of the novel do tend to stay with the reader. Unfortunately, it seems to be too little, 311 pages too late.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I heard this was a good film through some friends and considering it was the week of halloween I thought celebrate with a good scary movie. I don't really care for movies that have a gotcha or someones going to getcha theme. This really played into the mind I figured out almost right away who the guy was but I really liked it any way. In fact the point of the movie is to make you appreciate your life. I got out of it what I needed a little scared but not grossed out by blood.
1592332803|5.0|Serving these cakes to family and friends is a wonderful way to reassure meat eaters that vegans do not have to sacrifice in the desssert department.  \\"But I thought you don't eat cake,\\" invites an opportunity to explain that you don't need eggs or butter to create scrumptious, memorable cakes for any occasion. I am so grateful for this book! It will save me a fortune, as I no longer have to order vegan birthday cakes for the family from Whole Foods!
0060989157|4.0|Pure entertainment Crue Style.  I read Tommyland, Tommy Lee's book, and was interested in reading this one.  Not a bad read and never gets boring.
B000VZSEWA|2.0|I used to be pretty into Nine Inch Nails about 15 years ago. I've got to say though, that this album is pretty much a disaster for me. I don't want to listen. The only song worth repeated screening is Survivalism.<br /><br />I haven't decided yet if that's because I've grown out of the genre or because Trent Reznor is getting worse at making music. I am not a music fanatic but I know what I enjoy. Year Zero is not what I enjoy. It's too far from music and too close to pure cacophony.
1401207138|5.0|If you are looking for a perfectly executed Absolute Edition to what I and many others consider the best graphic novel of all time, look no further. The packaging, as well as the re-print quality and the extras are all top-notch. The only minor complaint that I have is that it smells a little funny when it's new. Kinda like chemicals. Anyway, a must have.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I enjoyed this cd so much that I purchased copies of it for my children for Christmas and several of my friends.  I couldn't wait for the boys to hear his music so gave them out early and both have called me and told me how surprised their are that first their mother found this guy and second that they really like his music.  This cd is a winner, it will speak to any age and quickly become one of the favorites in the house.
B00005JPRE|5.0|I was there in the Sixties -  started college in September 1967 - and know the good and bad of it firsthand. I was frankly sceptical about this movie (being \\"about the Sixties\\") and went along without expectations. At the very start, my reaction wasn't positive and I didn't know whether to leave or stay. Soon, however, the unexpected freshness of the approach, the intense relevancy (and even new spirit) the film gave to the marvelous Beatles songs, and the deepening and increasingly recognizable fidelity given to the stages through which we passed back then, won me over completely. Then there were the super special effects. I see this film as an impressionist painting, where impressions give a finer sense of reality than realism often can. And I can only say that no movie I have seen gives a truer sense of what it felt like to be college age in the late Sixties and early Seventies. This is a great achievement and a must-see for anyone who wonders about the Sixties or wishes they had been there.
0345337581|5.0|I bought this book nearly 20 years ago, and was so impressed, I went to the bookstore and bought 10 more(paperback) copies and passed them out to family and friends. I have bought many more 'learning' books on memory, speedlearning, etc. I never have found a   \\"better system\\" than Harry Lorayne's. Most of them are 'copies' of a similar mnemonic system. Has anyone ever 'improved' on Mr.Loraynes method? Like maybe a Speed Memorization course? Tony Buzan had a book entitled 'Speed Memory' but it seemed similar to Lorayne's, but not as good.Hmm, It seems like I am looking for a rapid way to memorize, with less effort,lol. May I also recommend 'BrainBooster' by Robert W. Finkel  Thank you for any suggestions!    p.s you can email me at ohiodave@neo.rr.com  Put \\"Memory Improvement\\" in the subject line
B000WBZ5M0|3.0|I had not seen any \\"Ocean\\" movies, so I did not know what to expect from Ocean's 13. Given the cast, especially Al Pacino, I was looking forward to it. My enthusiasm drained away pretty quickly, though, and I found it only mildly entertaining. The friend who invited me to watch it and who had liked both the Ocean's 11 remake and Ocean's 12, had the same reaction as I did, expressing disappointment with its relative lack of action and of spark to the characters.    Ocean's 13 has a light, glib flow and style to it. It has some pleasant, attractive actors and scenery. Pacino's electronic security system gives the movie some focus and challenge.  But its choppy pace and its frivolity are disappointing. When a movie, like this one, sets up a series of major and minor \\"cons,\\" it should use subtle, clever strokes and should play fair. This movie plays fast and loose on both scores.    Within minutes, Ocean has lined up numerous moles in key positions in Pacino's casino. This occurs in flimsy and unbelievable ways, like simply dropping in and making an open-ended promise to a desk clerk that she will be made a manager, slipping a restaurant manager some fast cash, and catching a casino floor manager pawning fancy casino silverware. The way Ocean infiltrates one of his own men into the casino as a dealer is played more for laughs than believability, and it is left completely up in the air how later busting the cover of that same man makes any sense as part of the plan (in fact, it almost destroys the plan). A quick, easy conversation with one big-shot is all it takes for Ocean to get numerous \\"whale\\" high-rolling gamblers to up and leave Pacino's hotel.    Very early on, Ocean's team seems to have free run of the casino's security and electronics floor. With ease, they repeatedly tramp back and forth across it, so that, for example, one of his men can relieve a guard at just the right moment. Details about how Ocean plans to fix Pacino's dice, roulette wheels, and slot machines, and use a gigantic drill to mimic an earthquake, are glossed over to the point they come off as amateur science fiction - not to mention \\"the Gilroy,\\" some sort of magical love potion used to reduce the only mildly competent guest character in the film, Pacino's top manager Ellen Barkin, to jello.    And then there is the way the team spoils Pacino's attempt to get a five-star rating for his hotel. The movie goes completely over the top in inflicting all manner of extreme, unbelievable, foul treatment on the implausible-acting visiting critic. Not content at depriving Pacino of five stars, the movie pounds the joke into the ground, not stopping even at one star. How, in the midst of all of the luxury and other satisfied hotel guests, are we supposed to think that the critic, or anyone else, would believe such an exaggerated, isolated experience? As if in recognition of the near-sadistic, unfunny excess, there is a simple-minded, contrived scene at the end where the beleaguered critic is helped to win big at an airport slot machine.    Playing fair not only means that the film cannot lift off completely from reality, but it also means that both the good and bad guys need to be up to the challenge. Here, Pacino does nothing but talk tough.  He is given fair notice by Ocean at the outset, but does not make a single smart move the entire movie, only mistake after mistake (such as being easily manipulated into allowing Bernie Mac to set up a game on the casino floor and generally allowing Ocean's men to swarm all over his hotel, completely undetected and undeterred). In one token scene, which the script comes right out and tells us is meant to show how savvy Pacino is, he taps into an FBI computer to search for the identity and known associates of a dealer who Ocean planted in the casino.  But this incident only undercuts everyone's credibility.  It depends on Ocean confusingly blowing the dealer's cover, it nearly destroys Ocean's plans, and the way Ocean and hismen get out of it is wildly exaggerated and far too easy.  Way too easily, Ocean dismisses Pacino's threats at the end, confirming the character's total impotence.    Indeed, the few adversities faced by Ocean are trumped-up accidents, either overcome too easily or too implausibly. As a result, there is a near-total lack of suspense and a diminished, anticlimactic sense of accomplishment at the end.    The film has an overall slack pace, despite -- or maybe because of -- rapid cutaways between short, thin scenes. At times, it feels like slow-motion, which can be one of director Soderbergh's worst tendencies. This saps not only the drama but also the humor. There are so many characters that few if any have time to shine. As if to make up for this, Damon, Cheadle, and Bernie Mac get strained, far-fetched, show-boating scenes that only fall flat. Andy Garcia seems injected almost as an afterthought.    While the film evokes some sentimentality about the Elliott Gould character, including a short scene reminiscing about \\"the old Las Vegas,\\" much about this is superficial and unexplained. His end scenes, in which he shows up and struts around at Pacino's casino in fancy dress with a big cigar in his mouth, acting triumphant based on absolutely nothing that he himself has done, strike a false and ineffective note.    Nothing could be easier with a movie like this than writing a canned, shallow, gushing review, celebrating the movie's famous faces and places and glitzy, smooth, and easy feel. Of course, these qualities, and the talented people involved, create some entertainment value.  But any serious review has to come to grips with the failings that make this movie a disappointing missed opportunity even as mildly entertaining fluff.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is the best Star Trek series made to date. Having the whole series in a single set is great. The packing is a little annoying, but it doesn't take up much space, which I like.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The original Bruce is back with the classic Springteen sound from the Jersey shore. Let the party begin, it's time to dance!
B000002UJQ|3.0|The details of this album have been debated ad nauseum, so I won't go over that.  I'm just going to offer my basic opinion.  After my brother strongly recommending this CD to me, I bought it.  I have listened to it in my car for many months and have withheld judgment until now.    I give the music 4 stars and Yorke's singing 1.5 stars.  Honestly, his high, grating, non-musical voice took a while to stand long enough to give the music a chance.  Compared to Yorke, Robert Plant is Pavarotti.  Having said that, after my distaste for Yorke's \\"singing\\" waned I was able to enjoy the music.  I don't find it to be as revolutionary and genius as Pink Floyd, but it is fairly substantive.    Usually I can learn to tolerate and even like what is technically poor singing, and to some degree that has occurred with Yorke, but in the end I've had extreme difficulty \\"getting over\\" his sound.
B000XPOB0M|1.0|I suppose that if you're looking for cliches, predictable effects, and a pseudo-religious thrill, you could do worse.  Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, Executive Decision, and other pieces of dreck) is just right for this sort of thing.  He, like Joel Schumacher, don't seem to care anything about originality or innovation, which rears its ugly head scene after scene in this flick.  I fell asleep four times and am not sure what I missed.
0156012197|5.0|The Little Prince is ostensibly a children's book with lots of lessons for EVERYONE!  Read it again and again and you will find a new nugget of wisdom each time.  I adore this book as do my students.  You won't be disappointed!!
B000006XSD|3.0|Not bad for a 3ed solo go for the coop but as a follow up to NIGHTMARE and GOES TO HELL it is almost as if it is another artist altogether.\\"It's Hot Tonight\\" is the only song new alice fan will reconise as he still sings it all the time.The only other semi good song is \\"You and Me\\" a ballad for the working man.it's good but again it's not Alice. All in all Lace And Wiskey was a let down for me,but beeing a true fan I'll keep it. Maybee even listen to it once in awhile.......
0743486285|5.0|I loved this book! Gives you an unconventional look into the whole 'rockstar' lifestyle. If you've lived a sheltered life you may find parts shocking. If this ain't your first rodeo, you may learn from a few of his mistakes.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|I thought I knew the plot all the way through the movie.  At one point, forget about it! I wish I had kept count, but I thought I had the cliff figured out each time.  I was actually dizzie by the credits and if I had not been busy the next day, I would have watched the movie more then once, to see how I was so easily confused.<br />If you are looking for something to make the evening a mandatory cuddle fest out of the evening, this is the flick.  If you want to test your testosterone in private or with friends in the man cave, this is much better then a Resident Evil marathon.  Add this to your DVR or Tivo recordings of Sci-Fi Channel's Ghost Hunter's better cases.<br />By no means was it as freaky `The Exorcist', so hang in there!
B000002KCF|5.0|Michael Franks really proves right from the start that he is a sophisticated and unique voice in music. His lyrics are cynical, risque, and smart. Brilliant songwriting and the ace sidemen of the Jazz Crusaders group help make this a solid album from beginning to end. A must-have for jazz vocal aficionados.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This was a really good twist in and out plot movie.  Marckie usually does not usually find a good script all the time.  This is not one of those times.  Not a bad movie for the man cave get together movies.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|There aren't too many albums that I give 5 stars for, but this is one of them. I've been following Creed since its inception. Now with the transition into Alterbridge's second solid album, they are proving they have staying power. The lyrics aren't just more of the same as we see with so many sequels...\\"Can anyone justify how we're living? Before tomorrow comes, we can change Everything....We can be so much more than we are!\\". The melodies and vocal harmonies are crisp, clean, and more complex than just pure 4ths throughout every song.  And there's no arguing that there just aren't too many voices out there like Scott's. That guy can blow it out! From a purely musical standpoint, these guys are refining what is already quite a deep well of talent. When so many bands out there are just pumping out albums for the sake a new release, Alter Bridge continues to hone their style, develop their talent, dig deep and rock hard!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The music is true Bruce, and as good or better than some of his golden oldies!  All Bruce fans will love this....
B00005Q45W|5.0|This album might be one of the best of Cohen's production, even though it is very difficult to choose from so many masterpieces. I own this CD and every time I listen to it I like it more, the unusual combination of music and lyrics is perfect and makes you feel out of this world for a while. My advice is to listen to Leonard's songs with somebody you love, if not, it could be dangerous to your health. All the songs are great but maybe the heart of the album is \\"You have loved enough\\".
B000V6BE6C|2.0|Waking the Fallen is still the band's best album to date.  City of Evil, despite some filler, was a good album.  Critical Acclaim and Almost Easy, and the band's interviews had me expecting some good things from this album.      It was not to be.  The album has some catchy tunes, but that's about it. The album is straight pop.  Don't waste your time... And A7X: don't waste mine.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This new britney album is wonderful. Every song on it was produced perfectly to match her voice. I think this cd is going to bring her to the top again and we will see the britney spears we all grew up with as teens.    SHES BACK
B000UNYK3A|4.0|Two American pals named Paxton and Josh(Jay Herandez and Derek Richardson) are traveling around Europe for some fun and sex. They meet an Icelandic man  (Eythor Gudjonsson) during their trip in Amesterdam as they head to a Slovokian city where they stay at a local hostel and get laid with beautiful girls. However, their ideal vacation soon turns into a nightmare of vicious terror as they are taken to a special secret place where criminals torture and kill people for profit, can they escape this living hell?<br /><br />Exciting and violent horror crime thriller from writer-director Eli Roth (\\"Cabin Fever\\") and producer Quentin Tarantino, the film is quite flawed such as the acting (you can overlook that) and some of the dialog. But there is some sleazy atmosphere and gory torture scenes to make up for those such as an icky eyeball torture sequence done to a Japanese tourist. The film does pay tribute to the torture films such \\"Ichi The Killer\\", \\"Men Behind The Sun\\", \\"Guiena Pig\\", \\"Audition\\", \\"Mark of the Devil\\", \\"The New York Ripper\\" and of course \\"Bloodsucking Freaks\\". Even if the film is tame compared to those movies, it's still a nice and atmospheric shock-feast with sex and violence abound especially hot babes even a cameo by director Takashi Miike.<br /><br />This 2-dis DVD set has the unrated director's cut and the extras include four audio commentaries, alternate ending, Hostel Dissected three part featurette, Kill the car multi-angel interactive featurette, music and sound featurette, Set Design featurette, An Icelandic meal with Eythor Gudjonsson featurette, KNB effects featurette, interview with Takashi Miike, Hostel dismembered International TV special and The Treatment radio interview with Eli Roth.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|Yeeeow!Talk about a gift from the rock 'n' roll gods! A record company finally gets it right for a change. That's so rare! This amazing set (which, despite its title, showcases them primarily from their best years) is a veritable treasure trove for Ramones fans.  The footage of the Rainbow show -- the show that was used for the It's Alive double LP (hence the titkle of this set -- well, it's a great title period for a live set!)-- the 12/31/77 footage is easily the high point of this collection. The 26 mins. from the show is easily amongst the the most exciting, electrifying concert footage in rock 'n' roll history. Just unbelievable. \\"Now I Wanna Be A Good Boy\\" is the most charged performance of the (half-) set, and Cretin Hop is also-- the damn thing just RULES! Also amongst the highlights are the US Festival footage, Don Kirshner(edited? where's the rest of it?);the 6/11/77 CBGB's reminds me why I fell in love with rock 'n' roll (and therefore, the Ramones) in the first place. The Camera Mart Stages has the greatest camera work/display (screen above focusing on an individual Ramone whilst you also see the whole band underneath)and it's Leave Home songs, their greatest album anyways! The 9/15/74 (!!!!!) CBGB's clips are mind-blowing to see, even if they weren't exactly, um, the tightest outfit exactly (ha ha ) -YET. God, there's SO MUCH on here!! Musikladen is also awesome; Old Grey Whistle Test in THIS quality (scumbag Spector never got this FAR superior guitar sound on Rock 'N' Roll High School);TVE Musical Express (if only Pleaseant Dreams sounded as good as This Business Is Killing Me and All Quiet On The Eastern Front do on here); Top Of the Pops; and the Oakland 12/28/78 performances (b&w; I'm Against It is FEROCIOUS!!!! One of my total favorite Ramones songs too. Needles and Pins is extra great here too.)The bonus clips ( a PROMO of It's Not My Place (In The 9 To 5 World) is WONDERFUL! Awesome! The Mandagsborsen interview is pretty funny, a nice feature aswell). While the quality on SOME of the early shows is indeed quite rough, so what! With over 4 hours, such a fairly comprehensive overview -- at this price!-- you can't complain! (Wish this had footage of the great lost Ramones song, All The Way...oh well you can't have everything -- but this set comes close)  Tons of awesome footage! Great to see Johnny's rock star moves -- he may have been a right-wing jerk, but his guitar playing was the sound of the Ramones, and he KNEW rock 'n' roll (was/is Ron Asheton enlightened? No, but it didn't stop the Stooges (formed '67, broke up '74, that Stooges) from being one of the greatest bands ever). Joey was the true soul of the band (not to discount talented yet poor, troubled Dee Dee, without whom-this band just ruled.  Now will Rhino PLEASE issue the 12/31/79 Palladium show on CD (and maybe a Cramps DVD w/their promos please?)(Thank you)  Dammit, if you love the Ramones, what are you waiting for!? GET THIS IMMEDIATEDLY!!!    YOU remember excitement.
B00006879E|5.0|I purchased Songs about Jane, only after I fell for, It Won't Be Soon before Long, and then was fortunate enough to see Maroon 5 in concert.  Every Song (on both CDs) is remarkable!  It is impossible to choose a favorite among them.
B00001W9G0|5.0|The real tragedy of this movie is the apparent disconnect of the title song, found on many Barbra Streisand recordings, and the picture itself. This is one mature love story,beautifully photographed, and very well acted by Redford and Streisand.Released during the Vietnam era,the picture is a breath of fresh air, even though the film portrays protests of the 1940's and 1950's. That's the rub: Streisand's jumping from one underdog cause to another finally dooms the love relationship with Redford(no polyanna himself) who's trying to make a living for the couple,first as an immature novelist, then as a budding screenplay writer. Their inflexibility regarding their individual roles in life sadly and slowly separates the pair,leading to an amiable breakup at the time of their baby's birth.(Truthfully, is there really such a thing as a 100% \\"amiable breakup\\")? Don't be content with just listening to the musical score, get yourself a copy of an outstanding motion pcture.

B000Q6ZG6G|4.0|It seems that of all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut seems to always fall into the category of \\"unappreciated\\" or \\"disliked.\\"  Ranks right up there with Barry Lyndon.<br /><br />However, I have always found this film to be the most accessible, honest, emotional, and humanly raw films Kubrick ever did.  If you are married or in a serious relationship, its themes resonate throughout one's being.  Like Othello who is consumed by jealousy, so is Tom Cruise's character, Dr. Harford, who throughout the film struggles with his wife's admission that she had urges for an illicit affair. Is her admission infidelity?  Does the mere thought or desire to be with someone else become immoral?  This is a film that is much greater than its parts and is too easily dismissed.<br /><br />As for the transfer itself, I have read many complaints that it is not very good.  However, I do remember seeing the film in its theatrical run and find this Blu-Ray release to be incredibly accurate.  Therefore, Warners should not be faulted for providing a very accurate presentation of this film on HD.  True, it is not a demonstration disc, but it is not a flawed or insulting transfer either.<br /><br />The good news is that we Americans are finally, FINALLY, permitted to see the \\"unrated\\" version that, in the end, turns out to be not that big of a deal.  The scene in question, that required CGI hooded figures to be strategically placed, is so un-erotic and an \\"Is That It??!!\\" moment, that one really wonders what is going on over at the ratings board.<br /><br />If there is a downside to the release, and this applies to almost ALL of the Kubrick hi-def releases, is the amateurish, sloppy documentaries that accompany each disc.  The production values of these mini-documentaries are, to be blunt, an insult to the films that they discuss.  The music, the cheap special effects, the b-movie feel to them is, at times, almost unbearable to watch.  The Kubrick Estate should have been more demanding of a more professional product than that is currently being presented.that is currently being presented.
0553805460|4.0|Basically, the book is not the tightest literary accomplishment of all time.  Yes, the term loamy loins is overused to a point of aggravation, but the book is an incredible entertaining read.  Every page you have to shake your head and ask yourself if there is any way this craziness could have really happened.  I found myself chuckling quite often and reading passages to others.      You want great literature, look elsewhere.  If you want a voyeuristic rollercoaster of excess, this is the place to look.  I'll read it again some day.
B000000W3G|4.0|Unlike Nirvana and Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins never had all the angst about success that the aforementioned bands had.  Sure, they had angst.  It was the mid 1990s and it was grunge.  Most bands had angst.  But Billy was smart enough to market it.  For Billy, he wanted to be a rock star, and that's what he got to be.      And not only that, he was the most prolific songwriter of the whole grunge movement.  I have assembled my own Pumpkins' B-Side/Rarities CD-R collection, which is a full five 80 minute cds, comprised entirely of material that was released officially but never released on their six studio albums.  This box set is a testament to his prolific writing.  What's also a testament to Corgan is just how GOOD all these B-sides are.  He's kinda like Dylan in that Corgan's outtakes, at least in this period, is just phenomenal.      For their third album, MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS, the band turned in one of the most ambitious (and some say indulgent) albums rock ever saw.  It was a double album with a two hour running time (long even for a double album), and Corgan and Company did everything from folk, dreamy pop, jazz, heavy medal, hard rock, and new wave.  Listening to Corgan was somewhat akin to listening to an amalgamation of David Bowie, Husker Du, and a good number of 1970s rock bands.  For my money, MELLON COLLIE is a flat-out masterpiece, easily the best album the band ever did, and on par with Soundgarden's BADMOTERFINGER, Alice in Chains' DIRT, Pearl Jam's TEN, Mudhoney's, and even the critical darling Nirvana's NEVERMIND.  In my view, MELLON COLLIE really is my generation's version of Pink Floyd's THE WALL.  It's that good.    But here's the amazing thing.  After the band released the double album in 1995, they released this box set just a little over a year from MELLON COLLIE.  As good as MELLON COLLIE is, and even given its rather abnormal length, listening to this sounds like the band actually cut quite a bit of incredibly entertaining material here.  In fact, they could have followed MELLON COLLIE up with a new album in 1996 or 1997, and it would have been just as big a hit as their magnum opus.    But the band didn't do that.  You see, Corgan, kinda like Ryan Adams (though that comparison may be a bit unfair to Corgan), is very much about the rock star image, and AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH is designed just as much for the retro throwback to 1960s and 1970s record releases and that era's rock culture as it is to release new material.    Rather than assembling a second album (or, as I like to think of this box set, a third disc to MELLON COLLIE), Billy supplemented each of the five singles drawn from MC with 4 to 6 new songs, gave each disc its own kind of mini-album continuity, and released it in a rather cumbersome box set.  All told, there's about one hundred and forty minutes of music here, longer than the original album, which is already something of a monstrosity when it comes to length.    Each disc follows its own flow.      Disc 1, the \\"Bullet with Butterfly\\" single, has the lead track, a great mellow acoustic number sung by James Iha and D'arcy and then several covers.    Disc 2, the 1979 single, is the rock/pop EP, and has some of the best songs on the entire set.    Disc 3, the \\"Zero\\" single, is the more hard rock and metal EP.  The single has the only really bad song here, the twenty three minute \\"Pasticho Medley\\".  Esentially, the song (if you can call it that) is a bunch of roughly edited snippits of all these unfinished songs and recordings the band made during the album sessions.  In fact, the medley is rather jarring to listen too, as it feels like Corgan was going to make an epic instrumental of all his unreleased songs, but rather than write interconnecting instrumental parts and transitions, all this music just butts up against each other.  I've listened to AEROPLANE for a long time, and I only made it thru \\"Medley\\" once.  Trust me, life's to short to listen to it any more than that, and even once is questionable.    Disc 4, the \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" single, focuses more on the ballad, dreamy pop sound, and has one of their all-time definitive songs (\\"Rotten Apples\\").    Disc 5, the \\"Thirty Three\\" single, is the most wide ranging in sound, featuring winding guitar epics to rather experimental cover choices.    Now, lets look at THE AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH had the band chose to release this as a regular album.  First off, dispense with the already released songs.  That knocks out about twenty minutes.  Then knock off the utterly disposable \\"Pasticho Medley\\".  That's roughly forty five minutes gone.  Then delete all the covers. After this musical exorcism, you're left with roughly seventy five to eighty minutes of original music.  And it's some of the best music of the Pumpkin's career.    You don't get better music in the grunge genre than \\"Set the Rays to Jerry\\", \\"Ugly\\", \\"Pennies\\", \\"Believe\\", \\"God\\", \\"Medallia of the Grey Skies\\", and the rest.  I fully believe had they released the music in a more user-friendly format, the resulting album would be as highly regarded as SIAMESE DREAM and MELLON COLLIE, and as it is, of all their B-sides AEROPLANE sounds most like MELLON COLLIE, enough to be a third disc of that album.  While I've never been a fan of the title cut (gets a little monotous for my taste, and strangely enough they cut almost a minute off it on ROTTEN APPLES), \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" certainly does have an epic guitar feel to it, and would have fit in well with MELLON COLLIE.    And of course, we have one of the Pumpkin's best songs, the aforementioned \\"Rotten Apples\\".  The song's so good they even named their greatest hits package.  It's one of my top five favorite songs of not only the Smashing Pumpkins catalogue but the whole grunge scene indeed.  What the hell Corgan was thinking (for you know he is the band, as evidenced by ZIETGIST) when he cut the song from MELLON COLLIE I'll never know.    As evidenced by how popular theband was in 1996, when Virgin Records released the set it sold tremendously well.  A limited edition release, the box reached #42 on the Billboard charts, and sold 300,000 units (1.5 million discs in all), generating a platinum disc for the band. Originally intended to be limited to 200,000 copies, Virgin Records produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming and unexpected demand    Overall, the set has some of the Pumpkin's best songs here, and this is the closest thing we have to the great lost Pumpkins album.  Well, this, and the Reel Time demos they cut before GISH.    EDITION NOTIES: This set is now unfortunately out of print, and has been since 1996.  You'll have to buy it used or ebay it.    *For the smart consumer, you should know this box set curiously omits one officially released recording from the MELLON COLLIE era.  This is the instrumental \\"Infinite Sadness\\", available now on their Rarities/B-Sides digital downloads.  The song was originally released on the vastly reconfigured MELLON COLLIE vinyl album, which also included the \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" reprise found here.
0525950079|1.0|I read Pillars of the Earth wnen it came out and, as I recall, througly enjoyed it. Well either my taste has changed (and matured) or Ken Follet has forgotten how to write. This is a long extremely amatuerish effort written as it were by a smart high school senior or a not so smart college senior. There's absolutely no subtlety: the plot is constantly reviewed and repeated; the characters' thoughts are explicity laid out rather than inferred by developing their personas or what's going on around them; the language is crude and not in keeping. After reading about half of the book, I essentially read the rest at about double time to find out what happened, which was predictable.    Since Pillars of the Earth, I've read a lot of historical fiction, and this book is just trite play-acting. Sharon Kay Penman's Here be Dragons (13th Century Wales and England) and Sunne in Splendour (15th Century England) have the history, are much better researched, character's you care about, and first class writing. Do yourself a favor and try one of these.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I actually like this album. She really did good despite..well you know. It's not the greatest album to me but it is really good. I didn't think that she could have broken out of the teeny pop mold, but she surprised me. People say her album is crap but remember this girl is laughing all the way to the bank. I mean its number 1 on the itunes charts. She's also expected to sell over 300,000 copies this week. And ya'll realize that she been promoting the album everytime she appears in the papers and she didn't even have to go on tour.lmao. I only gave it a 4 because it is kind of bland at some places but it is overall good.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|Just saw these guys open for Kid Rock in San Francisco, and my god, they kicked butt. It was a total flashback to hard rock concerts of the late 70s and 80s. Straight at you, no nonsense ROCK. Loved the entire set and just ordered the CD. Looking forward to plenty of head bangin at home and in the car. Do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in their music. You won't be disappointed. Be sure to catch them in concert, too!

Then there are books that I read and dread coming to the last page.....when that final page comes, I can't help but obsess over it...  Can't wait for the 2nd book...Nag all my friends to buy and read the book.  The Name of the Wind is hands down one of the best books I've ever read. I needed a birthday present from my wife and for the the hell of it, asked her to get me this book last year.  WOW!  How lucky am I!?  Honestly, I love Tolkien, I love the Potter books, I adore His Dark Materials, but this is absolutely the best first book in a series I've ever read.  I truly fell in love with all the characters and the world Patrick created.  I can't wait for part 2.    A++++++++++++++++
B000V6BE6C|1.0|Oh look, a new Avenged Sevenfold record! \\"City of Evil\\" was really disappointing and annoying at times, but it had some of its moments. Let's see if their self-titled album redeems the band to their earlier and fresher days!<br /><br />No, it does the exact opposite. Avenged Sevenfold have become a POP band. Any trace of their past is erased. Gone. It's a complete 180. They tried experimenting, but only certain bands can experiment and pull it off well. Avenged Sevenfold is not one of those bands. They basically became an over polished pop-rock band that basically don't care about making good music anymore. For shame, but then again, I kind of expected it ever since \\"City of Evil\\" came out, and this album makes \\"City of Evil\\" look golden.<br /><br />This is a complete abomination that should never be purchased. Not to mention they did a lazy job on the album cover by inverting the colors on the \\"Waking The Fallen\\" cover.
0060589469|2.0|A friend recommended this book to me after he learned I was going on a 1200 mile motorcycle trip. I never did take the trip, but read the book anyway.    I found his monologues on quality boring and bordering on insane (he was insane, after all). After wrestling with this part of the book, I decided to focus on the trip, not the lecture. Some of his writing was very visual, though I found his conversations with his son troubling and sad, especially towards the end.    This was not a satisfying read, though perhaps because it is so highly viewed seemd more of a disappointment.

0385522401|4.0|McEwan's novella is chillingly touching.  It would be easy to distance oneself from Edward and Florence; yet the author creates real, flawed individuals with whom we can relate.  While not all can relate to their inhibitions about making love for the first time, we can all relate to their fears.  For us all, the past creeps into the present.  Tragically, these two can't release their grips on the past.      Eloquent and melodic, this writer's style has power.  The reader will fly through this short book in a sitting, yet the tragic loss of the characters will haunt us for much longer.  Many revere Atonement; however, On Chesil Beach is my McEwan favorite.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies, that followed. It is not one of the best, but it still deserves five stars...
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is an awesome CD! I bought tickets to \\"Jersey Boys\\" and needed this to supplement my meager Four Seasons stash.  I love these selections! These are the best of the best, in chronological order, and include Frankie's solos hits as well. I was engrossed with the liner notes, and learned a TON of Four Seasons history. I'm so glad I had this CD before seeing the play last week. It really made the story much richer. Thanks so much for this gem of a CD!!
B000GCFO08|5.0|This is a fascinating movie, well made, excellent actors, the story isw intriguing and makes you think... great entertainment of the very special kind!
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I work as an intern at Jive records and she came in for a few days, they recorded/dubbed her voice and that was it. The sound, the beats, everything was done out of her hands. To me that's where the music is at, in the beats a composition of the songs. Right? Britney is a name, and her name sells. I heard someone say that there. I believe it's true too. Reguardless if this album is good or bad it will sell either way. Everyone who made this record or promotes it will make money. It's a win, win situation. It's a shame that this happens in a world where real artists have to work for what they get and appreciate it. I do like the business for the most part though. Good with the bad.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Once i knew Kanye was set to drop on the same day as fiddy, i knew there was no way in hell i was purchasing 50's cd... the only thing left was to see if one of my favorite rapper/producers would finally fall victim to lack of ideas... i'm glad to say he didn't disappoint!! While it's not his best work (College Dropout), i still found this to be a good listen. My Criteria is simple... your cd needs to be good for a complete listen through, meaning no skipped songs... the more songs i skip, the worse the cd is!     My favorite song is no doubt \\"Stronger\\"... i'm also feeling \\"Barry Bonds\\"... although that took a while to grow on me... and i can't forget the heart felt tribute to Jayz, \\"Big Brother\\"!    All in all, worth buying!
0316172324|3.0|If you're interested in learning more about the psychology of consciousness, \\"Blink\\" is a good place to start.  Filled with entertaining and insightful anecdotes which illustrate the workings of the unconscious mind, this book will definitely get you thinking about the psychological (and, to a lesser degree, the philosophical) issues surrounding how we think.      However, I'm afraid that some readers may conclude that mere insight into the unconscious mind will change behavior for the better - this isn't always the case.  Don't read this as a how-to book for changing your unconsciousness mind, but rather just as a general over-view of one branch of cognitive psychology.  If you're feeling adventurous after reading this, check out Jayne's \\"Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\" or Wegner's \\"The Illusion of Conscious Will\\".

B000002U9W|5.0|If you are a Floydian purist than you'll agree that this is by far one of their best albums. The title song is absolutely exquisite. It feels like and sounds like your in an ancciant castle with chants filling the halls and spurts of psychodelia filling the brain. This goes on for over 20 mins.      And  than the rest of the journey brings us \\"Alan's psychodelic breakfast\\", a surreal yet humorously creative tune. This album is for anyone who is truly searching for that one musical creation that takes you on a journey, dizzies you, and than brings you safetly back to the earth-plane. Enjoy.
0307387178|2.0|This book came highly recommended and my wife and I were gripped by his previous book \\"Into Thin Air.\\"  But try as we might we couldn't seem to connect with Chris.  Far from this being the heroic story of a man facing nature, we found him to be a selfish kid who trashed all of his relationships and got in over his head.    Coincidentally I spent the summer of 1992 just outside of Fairbanks in the town of North Pole.  From that experience I learned that while the beauty of Alaska is stunning and awe inspiring, it can turn on you in a minute.  I also learned that you never, ever, ignore the advice of someone who lives there.  The idea that you can tramp into the woods with a bag of rice, and grossly small calibar gun, and survive strikes even a city dweller like me as stupid.    Also stupid is the idea that you can leave your family and countless people who want to befriend you with wave and a \\"Maybe I'll see you again someday.\\"  Keeping in touch, even before cell phones, was ridiculously easy and really a responsiblity to the people who love you.    Finally, I have to say we were a bit disappointed in the book itself.  This story began as a 9000 word essay in Outside Magazine and frankly much of the expanding for the book was nothing more than expansion.  While Krakauer has a story himself to tell about going into the wild, we didn't think it added anything to this story.  He also devotes a chapter to several other people who went into the wild equally unprepared and who met the same fate.  Perhaps this would have worked if this had been a book about the Alaska wilderness but it wasn't    We're thinking of skipping the movie.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|This newest studio release is different, the sound is the same Zombie sound but slower and heavier. Dont get me wrong here there are no bad songs on this cd, if there was I would say so!! 17 Year Locust is the gem here, Ride, also The Lords of Salem are great songs. Its one of those cds that you listen to from start to finish and every song fits in perfect!!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Regarding the review cited as the \\"most helpful critical review,\\" in which the main criticism is that the aspect-ratio of this DVD is 1.66 throughout instead of \\"variable\\" (some shots 1.33, some 1.66), I'd like to put to rest the unfortunate idea that Kubrick ever intended this film to be seen with a \\"variable aspect ratio.\\"  Yes, the film was photographed that way; but no, it was not meant to be seen that way.  Let me explain:  \\"Variable aspect-ratio\\" seems to be a term invented to market an early DVD release of \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\"  The term has no meaning in the film industry because no film has ever been released that way (except for that misguided \\"Strangelove\\" DVD -- a mistake which has now been corrected).  Most of \\"Dr. Stangelove\\" was photographed with no matte in the camera, thus exposing the entire 1.33 film frame.  Many shots, however, were filmed with a 1.66 matte, reflecting Kubrick's intention to release the film to theaters in 1.66.  Therefore, if you transfer this movie to tape using an unmatted film element, and you take the whole 1.33 frame for every shot, the aspect ratio will vary between 1.33 (shots filmed with no matte in the camera) and 1.66 (shots filmed with a 1.66 matte). But it seems self-evident that this is not the way any movie was ever intended to be seen, with the shape of the frame randomly bouncing around from shot to shot for no reason.   So why shoot it that way?  Because Kubrick (and his cameraman) knew that one of two methods would be employed to ensure the aspect ratio of the theatrical presentation: either the theatrical printing negative, and therefore every release print sent to theaters, would have the 1.66 matte printed-in from start to finish, or each print would be shipped with written instructions for the projectionist to put a 1.66 matte in the projector gate.  Either method would result in a consistent 1.66 aspect ratio from start to finish, and both methods were commonly used in the days when theaters projected 35mm film prints, before digital projection.  Is it possible Kubrick shot it \\"variable\\" so that the eventual 1.33 DVD release could have a meandering frame-line?  I know Kubrick was smart, but it's unlikely he was thinking of the DVD release in 1964.  In those days, movies were made for theaters; televised movies were mainly 16mm prints, edited for time and sold in syndication.  The TV market as it existed in 1964 did not influence any film director's compositions.  The theatrical release was all that mattered; and the theatrical release of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" was 1.66.  All of it.  Therefore, if one wants to see this film the way Kubrick meant it to be seen (and a new, matted 35mm print is not available), the film-to-tape transfer must recreate the matted 1.66 theatrical aspect-ratio throughout -- which is what the \\"40th Anniversary\\" DVD and of course the BluRay do (thank you, Sony Home Video).  I oversaw film restorations for a major Hollywood film studio for more than a decade, so I know the subject of aspect ratios pretty well.  Hope this info is helpful.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|It's simply a brilliant piece of art...! a must have for any David Gilmour fan.
B000Y179KO|4.0|As a long time Eagles fan and performer in an Eagles tribute band I feel that while it is wonderfully refreshing to hear these masters back on my various media players (don't know if they'll receive much airplay over here radio being what it is...or isn't!) doing what they do best there are a couple of things which need to be addressed: This IS the Eagles we all know and love... but it is the Eagles at the tail end (pun not really intended;-) of 2007 and not 1972-79.     With a generous 20 songs there are moments stylisically speaking which recall many though not all of their past moments of sonic glory. The melodies are strong and the harmonies chime clear and ringing as ever.  The thing that is most noticeably missing from the mix (apart from mssrs Felder, Meisner, and Szymczyk, but I'll address that later!) is simply the youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, piss and vinegar or their heyday: That being said we cannot nor should not expect the Eagles to stop time and transport us instantly to 1976 as if neither we nor they have grown, aged, matured, and become more world weary with the rather substantial passage of time. Just be aware this is appropriately a more mature and comfortable in their own skins Eagles. The angry yet somehow-still-laidback young men of 1976 have become noticeably more reflective in tone and attitude. This is a good Eagles album - whether it is a classic or not will be proven out with the passage of even more time.     I do find myself enjoying it more with repeated listens.    While I salute the Eagles for doing this whole thing themselves and using their position to avoid dealing with major labels they would have benefitted greatly from having a producer because the album is a bit too tame and slick sounding. I really wonder how much better this could have been with Bill Szymczyk back onboard as producer to give them that edge, tension and spark that their best records had. To that end I also feel the songs are missing the contributions of Randy Meisner and Don Felder who would have no doubt added a bit more toothy grit and rock to the sound. Timothy Schmidt is great but Randy's voice and writing had a bit more character and intensity.    If their decision not to use Bill Szymczyk as producer stemmed from a concern about getting a more contemporarily representative sound it would have been REALLY interesting to hear what a producer like Rick Rubin would have done with this! Rubin's talent for getting the sound of pure honesty and human grittiness on record is legendarily in evidence on recordings by everyone from Red Hot Chili Peppers to Johnny Cash and Tom Petty.    All in all though I would say that this is a relatively satisfying record for long time Eagles fans as well as fans of contemporary country music. It is PERFECT for background music at the office or while working at home or on the car stereo when in the mood for something laidback and not too raucous.     The supreme irony here though is that the recording is not raw or lo-fi enough to draw in many of the Alt-country fans (a genre which the Eagles, Poco, Gram Parsons and the Byrds were all influential in creating) who could've been a very significant crop of new fans had they used someone like Rick Rubin to produce. Not that the Eagles are bound to notice. It'd just be nice to have new generations support their ongoing work.    Long Road Out of Eden is a bit like putting on your favorite NEW pair of jeans then... The ones with about 4-6 extra inches in the waistline;-)

0812550706|5.0|Desperate war psychology strategy classic.      This is Card's masterpiece.  Taking an earlier novella, extending it and actually making it considerably better is a very impressive feat.    The basic idea is that the Earth military is in a war with aliens and need something to help them fairly soon.  Enter the Battle School and a program to find genius children than can be turned into masters of space war by intensive early training.    Ender Wiggin is one of these children, and becomes their natural leader, with some support.    The novel grippingly looks at using children for war, and the problems of training those whose intellects exceed yours, as well as the ethics of the situation, while keeping the reader and the young characters in the dark as to what is going on.    A book that works well for all ages without simplification, and an outstanding writing achievement.

B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I listened to the album on MSN the other day (and sat through the entire thing without fast-forwarding) and I gotta say ~ It's  an album of heavily-processed 'TALKING' (..must have missed the singing bit) over a number of very similar 'boop/bleep beats'. The whole thing. That's it.<br />  To each their own I guess..  But I personally found the whole thing silly and boring. Not even worth an 'illegal download'.. let alone actually paying something. (May as well throw my money in a dog's mouth if I was going to do stuff like that..)<br />If this is supposed to be her 'Best Yet!' (an often used phrase here)  ..I'd really hate to experience what the 'less than best' involved.<br /><br />Really people, If this is all it takes to entertain you these days?..  I recommend getting yourself a few electronic gizmos and a digi recorder.  That ought to REALLY give you a blast  ..and you might very well make a few BETTER albums than this one along the way.
B00006J3T4|3.0|Mark Knopfler is a gem and remains one of the most enduring icons of real talent in a world of fleeting mediocrity. This CD is as solid as ever, is beautifully mastered, and easy to listen to. But, it takes no risks, shows none of the searing energy that used to make the hair stand up on the back of my neck, and simply does not showcase his limitless talent. I listen to Dire Straits religiously and crank up the volume like I'm still 20 years old. I listen to this CD once in a while. The old Mark Knopfler - the guy that stood toe to toe with Clapton at Knebworth and whipped the crowd into a frenzy - seems forever gone, and I miss him. I wish HE would record another CD, because DAMN that guy was good.
0316067598|5.0|Very engrossing book. It should be read by everyone so that they see what war is really like. Hard to put down. Marcus and his fellow SEAL's are real men in every sense of the word.
B000UYC0P4|5.0|I was a little disappointed when Natalie came out with a singles CD, but when I learned it included all of her videos on DVD, I figured it was worth it.  The 4 new songs are a nice addition.  The videos are great, but many are the version shown in England and lack the polish of big budget American videos, but are well worth having at that quality level.  They are far superior to anything that is available for download.  This \\"greatest hits\\" CD is well the money and is a nice addition to any Imbruglia fan.  (meaning anyone who can actually spell Imbruglia)
0374105235|5.0|For me, this book was very difficult to read, I could only read a few pages at a time. That wasn't because of it's literary deficiencies, it was that it was heart wrenching to read. The book describes what it is like to be a boy soldier in Sierra Leone after literally losing everything and everyone.     Reading it slowly gave me time to reflect on the book and absorb what I was reading. I highly recommend this book. His story is truly amazing.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Fabulous social commentary and musical treat from one of the great masters of modern musical style.  Highly recommend this album to all.
1594481717|5.0|I discovered Daniel Pink's \\"A Whole New Mind\\" while I was in search for a better way to make power point presentations. Power Point sent me to the Zen of design, which sent me to the negative space of graphics, which sent me to the psychology of learning, where I landed upon Pink's great book. The journey was reflective of Pink's belief that just over the horizon, Right Brain (\\"R Directed thinking\\" in his lexicon), resplendent in its ability to recognize patterns in disparate actions, will be the key to success and competitive advantage.     After reading his book, you'll agree that the future belongs to those of us who can craft symphonies from unrelated categories (as opposed to those who just analyze alone), who have narrative aptitude for story (instead of who just read power point slides), and who have empathy to solidify relationships (as opposed to transactional engagements) we will be the masters of the his Conceptual Age.      Pink layers on aspects of globalization in advancing his argument pointing out that with ever flatter competitive markets, cost reductions and scale-welled educated workforces in Asia the old narrow advantage of rote fact based work will fall to the greater functionality of working jazz, blending and connecting high Concepts, relational advantages driven by right brain thinking. Not withstanding some of the New Age qualities such as \\"laughter class\\", and the buttressing the argument with globalization theory, Pink is spot on regarding the increasing economic value of pattern and strategy recognition. At root his book is as much about approaches to business and competition as it is about psychology and the development of man's working culture.     My epiphany in discovering the book is precisely how he outlined his theory of \\"High Concept\\" and its advantages. The pattern I detected in my journey was all about personal effectiveness. In riffing from design theory to graphics, then to learning theory, my \\"R Directed thinking\\" was cobbling together my own pattern recognition of personal effectiveness and the ability to lead an audience and establish \\"thought leadership.\\"     The easily read and well crafted book grabbed my attention from the onset. Along the way I found new language to describe how I already do things and approach problems. In building out a global business key elements of my success have been on the L Directed ability to execute, a focus on making things happen, but also within an overall big picture, R Directed aspects on the \\"Symphony\\" which Pink asserts the \\"Conceptual Age\\" will require. Too often, the business press narrows on \\"focus\\" to develop \\"expertise\\" but the real high value functions is not about how well you know one market or a technology, but how well you assimilate the pieces into the bigger picture. The special talent in the ability to interpret things simultaneously, in seeing all the elements of a situation and understanding what they mean is really the Holy Grail in global business. In short, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.    If you're reading this blog, with its combinatorial elements, I think you'll really enjoy Pink's book. Whether it might be varied country markets such as Asia, N. America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, CEER, or a wide range of commercial sectors crossing mobile, banking, content, platforms or social networks, the results and the rewards will go to those who can operate with equal aplomb in very different categories. Ummm, sounds familiar to my own background. Probably why I enjoyed it so much. \\"A Whole New Mind\\" is an enlightening read for any global professional and should be on your reading list or office book shelf.
B000M4RG42|4.0|I don't know what the point to this motion picture really was but underneath its surface it contained a nasty cynicism I did not like. This is better than Letters From Iwo Jima, but somehow it falls short of the mark of completion just as its sister film did. The performances here were very good and the battle scenes (which were often lacking from Letters) were appropriately tragic in their depiction of the obscenity that is war. The historical tale of the behind the scenes machinations both in the flying of the American flag on Mount Suribachi and in the marketing first of the image and later of its titular participants was interesting and also slightly sad because it was cruelly disillusioning. As for what else was wrong with this movie...I felt throughout that what I was seeing was something like a one point presentation padded out and masquerading as a war film. I know Flags of Our Fathers is factual and on the part of many people a labor of love, but it is also not a great film, and I say this for a number of reasons. We dwell in an age in which it is seen as sophisticated to tear down icons and myths, and to dwell on the fact that human beings are all too fallible. I found this film to be one of the ultimate exercises of this. At best it is a four-star production.
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|very good product but would be nice to find an 800 to dual 400 adapter.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Whenever people start talking about politics, it's next to impossible to stay objective--which is why I deeply appreciate this excellent documentary by Errol Morris.      Touching on issues of morality in warfare and the responsibilities of the human race in a nuclear age, \\"Fog of War\\" is the closest to an objective analysis of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the fire-bombings of Japan that I have ever seen.  The reason is Morris' format--a one-on-one interview with Robert S. McNamara, interspersed with news and military footage.  This format allows the audience to discuss McNamara's views and experiences and the surrounding issues without first needing to sift through the bias of the director (which is always my complaint with Michael Moore documentaries).  In short, we as the audience get to make up our own minds, which is the hallmark of a good documentary.      I have taught this film in my college composition classes several times, and the students seem surprised by how it manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time.  The film quality is superb, and the haunting score by Philip Glass also sets the stage for some tough questions: 1) Is McNamara a war criminal?  2) What would we have done in his place? 3) And more importantly, what can we learn from McNamara's invaluable lessons and experiences?
0783240236|5.0|The Birds is classic Hithcock with a building suspense of horror of nature hitting back at man for changing its enviroment .   Normally bening birds are suddenly attacking in mass and species that usually do not flock together attacking together.  best   watched on a dark night in the company of a pet bird, sleep well.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This show truly is legendary.  It is a great show full of surprises and it just plain makes you laugh.  Definitely worth it.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This was purchased as a gift but I think we also enjoyed it years ago.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who is a Jane Austen fan, and so far I have seen about 80% of it.  It's full of great casting, great acting, great costumes, and wonderful sets, and we had no problems with the video that some other reviewers were finding.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|van helsing was a very enjoyable movie. i liked it. having all these monsters put together in one movie was a good one. nicely done. the makeup and special effects were great. the fact that hugh jackman was the lead was a very good choice. impressive acting and very believable. strong character. he made this movie all the better. as for kate beckinsale, she played her role well. good actress, and giving us a taste of what she has to offer. a story where monsters are a common thing. dracula, his ladies, frankenstien, dr.jekyll and mr. hyde, and the werewolf are thrust together. in creepy transylvania where all of these monsters reside. van helsing(hugh jackman) is called upon to take out this evil clan. just another mission, just another monster, but this one is a lot stronger. dracula who needs frankenstien to help him to get his babies to live. without him, all attempts fail, and they die. he wants to rule and take over. he must be stopped and frankenstien wants no part in it. anna is a vampire killer and her family has been for a long time. they must continue to kill them until there is no more left so that they may live in peace and continue on to heaven. they meet when van helsing kills one of draculas ladies. he is the first to have killed a vampire in years. thus they must help each other. all the while emotions get involved and makes for an even better picture. then annas brother gets bit by a werewolf, and so he bites van helsing. who will eventually turn into one as well, unless they retrieve the antidote. anna never expected her brother to become that which they killed. she is the last of her line. she must fight until her mission is complete. they come upon draculas home, where the action continues, and anna must fight like never before. the only way to beat dracula is to get bit by a werewolf. well lo and behold van helsing will become one. nice fight scene in the end. great stuff. these kinds of monster flicks do it for me. the ending should have been different, but at least anna and her family found peace at last. and frankenstien was free, and van helsing having loved will continue on to be a different man.
B00003CXD0|5.0|If all that you're interested in when you view a DVD is great music, great acting, and a plot that taps into all of your emotions, then get Tootsie.  Dustin Hoffman is perfect in his role, as are Terri Garr, Jessica Lange, and the rest of the ensemble.  Dave Grusin's music sets the mood perfectly for the various emotional rides.  Overall, it's a study in \\"Correct.\\"<br />TONY HOROWITZ
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD which was written in a very laid back style. If you are looking for a CD of all Sultan's of swing type songs this is not it though definitely the talent of Mark Knopfler's guitar work is shown in it. The album covers many of the things the common man runs into in his daily grind and I especially love Punish the Monkey which is so relavant to many people. Wonderful album and I am going to give one as a present to my sister for Christmas.
B000V6BE6C|2.0|Remember when Guns N' Roses released Use Your Illusion I & II and it cemented their legacy as one of the best rock bands ever?  That was Avenged Sevenfold's City of Evil album.  Then remember when Guns N Roses released the Spaghetti Incident and now everyone tries to forget that the album exists? Thats Avenged Sevenfold's new album.    That's not to say that there isn't a few good songs on the album, there is.  But the grit and swagger, the Avenged Sevenfold attitude that was exhuded in their prior music, is largely gone.  Oh yeah, there's also a country song.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|...and he has been judged to be one very talented fellow! The fact that he wrote, performed, and produced a release of such quality and vigor is nothing short of remarkable.    One of the members of SOAD is a casual acquaintance of mine, but I never bothered to explore their music as it wasn't really in my \\"style\\". Well, I recently saw the 'Empty Walls' video and was instantly hooked. Having listened to this CD in excess of 20 times this past week, I have yet to be anything less than fully captivated by it. The thing grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.    The varying tone, tempo, and structure of the album is extremely satisfying. From a soft pleasing melody to angry yet orchestrated chaos (and then back and forth again), Tankian somehow pulls off the impossible - he keeps the whole package together without allowing it to slip or fall apart. Well done.    One really needs to hear this CD multiple times in order to gain a full sense of appreciation for Tankian's abilities. I actually prefer the first half of the album, with songs like 'Empty Walls', 'Unthinking Majority', 'Money', and 'Saving Us' leading the way. But the entire CD resonates, and I was never disappointed.    Tankian has an advantage because not only is he a gifted poet, he is also a talented musician with a uniquely engaging voice. I liken Tankian to a modern-day Jim Morrison, which is quite a compliment.    Listening to this CD is not just an auditory experience, it is an intellectual and emotional life experience as well. While I don't always agree with Serj's views on all the issues, I respect his willingness to take a stand and to also bring those issues to the forefront.    Finally, I'd like to comment on the title 'Elect the Dead'. My own initial interpretation (and I'm sure there are others) was that it means it's better to have a lifeless corpse in political office rather than the self-serving and greedily manipulative buffoons who rape and loot during their terms, leaving us worse for theirwear (there are exceptions, of course).     Elect the Dead is one of the most richly rewarding CD's that I've listened to in a long, long time. Two thumbs up, 5 Stars, Yippee-Yahoo, or whatever measuring stick we'd like to use - this release is a bonafide winner.
1427200882|5.0|I am a 68 year old female retired attorney who is very active in the political scene in our country.  I am impressed with the research that Ms. Klein uses to document her statements in this book.  She helped me understand the events that have occurred in the past few years and why our world is in such turmoil.  It gives me more reason to work to try to make the changes that need to be made to assure corporations do not 'own' our governments and control the rulers of various countries.  I believe in Democracy and that it works only with an informed electorate.  Thanks to Naomi Klein for helping educate the electorate.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Who can beat Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler either individually or together? And together they make one helluvua duo who rock the house. I can't recommened this CD highly enough. I gave several as gifts last holiday and will do the same this winter.
0143038419|5.0|This book was an inspiration to me and everyone who I know that read it.  It is a fascinating chronicle of one woman's journey to find herself.  The book is also quite funny, sad at times, and is just a pleasure to read.  I couldn't put it down.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!! I downloaded 16 songs that didn't make it on the final cut of the album and in my opinion a lot of those tracks were better then what ended up on the final product. So on my iPod i have 28 songs for the Black Out album. This really could have been a GREAT ALBUM. Despite her personal life she could have channeled some great creative depressing energy into awesome POP music. I was actually in shock that she only co-wrote 1 song while the others were all heavily produced by big name producers. Though she has abandoned Max Martin and moved on she did work a lot with a specific producer from Sweden on this album who i believe she worked with back in her early days. Anyway that producer churned out the tracks Piece of Me, Radar, and Freak show. The song writers drew from her own life experiences and incorporated some of Britney's private life into the lyrics of the songs. When I heard the words in the song and knew it was about her Kevin I looked in the CD booklet and she didn't even write the song. To be honest i was very disappointed in this album. I haven't found 1 track besides Gimme More that has that HOOK to reel you in. And Gimme More had to grow on me it wasn't after the 1st listen that i was hooked. The commercial that promotes this album talks about the HOT new single \\"Piece of Me\\" and I just don't get that song, it doesn't do anything for me. This is sorta of a new sound for her, its very electronic, very mechanic and machine like and lacks any sort of feeling. It's all been done before by other artists who aren't so commercial unfortunately Britney will get all the kudos for it as if she invented the sound and in actuality she didn't but she's mainstream. I am sure this will out sell Christina's album but i was just expecting something else and unfortunately that wasn't delivered with Black Out. Here's hoping the new one will be better and she will finally work with Timbaland so he can REVAMP in her image the way he did Nelly Furtado.Furtado.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Wow, two reviews in one day. What a treat for you, my loyal readers.<br /><br />\\"Saw III\\" is actually a good movie. For the first time in the series they deliver what the promised. They live up to thier potential. There are some flaws though.<br /><br />First let me give you a brief summary of the plot. \\"Saw III\\" picks up exactly where \\"Saw II\\" left off. Dectective Matthews is held in the custody of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda (remember her). He is in the same room that was used with the two main characters in \\"Saw I\\". Quickly that somewhat wrap his storyline up, and then be prepared to forget about him for quite some time. We then meet the main characters or victims of this film. The first is a Doctor who is taken captive by Amanda, to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to witness his newest test subject. Jigsaw is not in good shape and it looks like he could die at any second. If Jigsaw dies, the doctor will lose her head, as a device is strapped to around her neck that will go off if she moves to far away, or if Jigsaw flatlines. We then meet the new test subject. His name is Jeff, and his son was killed in by I think a drunk driver, or at least a bad one. He is set on the path of forgivness. For the longest time he has neglected his daughter and his whole life to a life of obsession, obsession over killing the people he has blamed for the death of his son. Now he has the chance. In each room there is one person who he has blamed for the death of his son, and he has the chance to save them from the contraptions that they are in, or let them die. And lying at the end of the game is the man who killed his son.<br /><br />Their is also the development of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda. (Remember Becker? She was the dumb secretary). Unfortunatly for the people she tests, she does not follow the same rules that Jigsaw does. Outside the main story thier are a few other people that are affected by her. But she speacializes in false hope. She gives them truly impossible situations to get out of, and even if they do exactly as she has asked them to do they are doomed. While it is more cruel than Jigsaw, it makes the concept a little bit less interesting. But don't worry, it is all made up for in the conclusion.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is good. They tell us what is expected of the characters, and the consequences that would happen if they don't follow. And the characters for the first time in this series remember that. This is not like the second one where it was all about the killings. This time the killings actually help to further the plot, not just to please the audience. The writing is more natural than it has been in the last 2, and it has a very pleasing ending, making me wonder how exactly they did the next one. But I know they did because \\"Saw IV\\" is already out in theaters.<br /><br />They also throw in some information to further explain events in \\"Saw I\\" and \\"Saw II\\". This was interesting and fun, and made \\"Saw II\\" a little bit more worth my watching it. But another movie should not be needed to make another one worth watching.<br /><br />Because they made the cast smaller than the second one, and they increased the length of this movie, there was more time for character development in this movie. Although sometimes it can seem a bit forced, it works.<br /><br />A few problems. Although they offer a little bit of an explanation to what happend to Detective Matthews, they don't show 100% what happend to him. Some things don't further the plot, they are just there to put in a fun or interesting scene. I had another but I forgot it so it must have not been that horrible.<br /><br />All in all this movie is pretty fun, and has gotten me excited again for this series. I will probably go see \\"Saw IV\\" tomorrow or the day after and I look forward to giving you my review.<br /><br />I give \\"Saw III\\" a 7 out of 10
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The trio of songs towards the end of the album - \\"Magic\\", 'Last to Die\\", \\"Long Walk Home\\" - are classic Bruce, dark, honest, brutal, and profound.    \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"Livin' in the Future\\" are very good as well. When Bruce writes about the current state of our America, he does it extremely well, and somehow this aging man still sends chills up my spine.    This album is absolutely worth buying, especially since Clear Channel has BANNED it from its 1000+ stations for its political message.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|Anything by Diana is nice but I prefer if she would not do another Christmas CD.
B00007KQKM|2.0|I was really dissapointed with this film. I am crazy for any adaptation of a British Lit Classic, and have a very large collection of those types of movies. Very rarely do I find one that I just don't like.  This one is that rare film.  I tried to watch it twice, and I just cannot get into it. The music is so dull and repetitive that it could put you to sleep. It's like who ever wrote the score completed two minutes worth then gave up and just decided to replay it over and over again because they were already bored of it. It is really annoying. Furthermore the acting is nothing to write home about, either very stiff or complete overkill.  I don't even think the costumes are that good, which is pretty surprising.  I do not know the novel, so I am not sure how the characters are supposed to be, but in this film they are irritating. It is hard to sit through hours of a film when you don't like the main characters. If Lady Chatterly were your friend you would tell her not to get involved with that creep and stop whining. I had no sympathy for her. Her lover is nasty. He does not seem to even like her and then POOF! they are in love and running naked through the woods together. The only one you have any sympathy for is Lady Chatterly's husband, and his character is pretty annoying too.  The actor who plays him WAY overdoes it.  He is played like a farce.  The crazy war veteran who hears gunfire and is still commanding his troops, wearing his old uniform. He is a ridiculous stereotype that would be more at home in a comedy. The only part I remotely enjoyed was when Lady Chatterly goes to visit her eccentric and entertaining family by the sea.  At least the scenery is pretty. Unfortunately you will probably fall asleep or shut it off before you get to that point. It is as if the filmakers felt that they could get by with this one simply with the sex. But that is not enough.  This is not aimed at a porn audience, this is supposed to be aimed at an audience interested in a literary classic-- literature that is not purchased at the adult book store! If all you want to see is some bad sex scenes, full frontal nudity, and a lot of moaning and groaning, cut the crap and buy some porn!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|When I was in my early teens, I loved Britney's music. In the zone dissapointed me very much and she made mistakes as any other person does when they are young, and I dont understand why people are judging her so much, like there arent way more stupid people in the world. This album is the best comeback she could have done. Many of today's pop artists including Britney, have 3 or 4 catchy songs and the rest are all fillers, but this album has NO FILLERS. They all have great potential as singles and britney just sounds like she is enjoying herself. I really hope she can get her personal life on track, and that she could back this cd with amazing videos as she always has.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Well, all of the songs on this two CD set are new, just a tad over 90 minutes worth split up nice and even. The quality is amazing - WMA Lossless yields ~2500kbps on all of the songs. I'm sure everyone has heard such Eagles songs as The Long Run back in the heyday of records, and this CD set is a bit different from what most will expect. Most of the songs are smooth rock, some you can swear can almost be country, and some like the 10 minute title track Long Road Out Of Eden is amazing. Theres only one reason i give this a 4-star rating:    As i stated, this is only a 90 minute collection on two discs that can old 160 minutes. They should have used the extra space to put in some rare tracks or some fan favorites.    Pick up this CD set and you won't be sorry. Its not one you go around town with with the windows down and stereo blaring, but its great in the house or at a party.    Oh, and one last thing, Wal-Mart has this CD set for $11.88, exclusive to Wal-Mart which is why Amazon.com does not have it and why others try to gouge on the prices so they can make all of their money back and a profit!
B000P0J0G0|4.0|It is hard to imagine any sketch comedy series generating 5 stars. Who could maintain that level across such a format? The greatest bits from Cook and Moore, or Monty Python, would be a 5, or even 6, star collection. Unfortunately, there is more to both teams than their best bits. Since we have so little of Pete and Dud, it's hard to say. But with Monty Python, there were hours of unwatchable junk. Sorry, folks, it is true. However, when they were on, they were exquisite. Sublime, funny, and philosophical, with a clever and biting humor that took your breath away. There is a reason we know the words to the Cheese Shop sketch 30+ years later; it was entrancing. I remember watching that sketch when it was new; I knew right away this was more than just funny.<br /><br />Nothing in this set rises to those miraculous heights. Thankfullly though, nothing sinks to the dregs so common on the MP show either. This is hours of clever and witty stuff, with lots of laughs all over. The music is especially well done. Yet too many laughs are supposed to come from the use of naughty words, or Hugh and Stephen dressed as women. The naughty words are not necessarily funny, nor are men shrieking in women's clothing. (See way too many MP sketches for examples.) Overall though, there are plenty of excellent sketches, well delivered and well acted. (The supporting cast is often astounding.) As others have said, the laughs do decline badly in Series 4, and we can only be grateful they hung it up then.<br /><br />So, nothing that makes you say \\"That was ****ing brilliant!\\" but plenty to make you say \\"That was fun.\\" That's solid four star stuff.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Ignore what you read in the magazines about the downfall of this pop princess because \\"Blackout\\" is in no way a reflection of the most recent events in her life. A die hard fan from the very beginning, I was sad to see that Britney Spears' life has become the media circus that it is today. One thing you have to remember though, it's about the music at this point in her life and career. Having listened to every Spears album and owning them as well, I must say this is the best achievement of her long career. It starts off with a great kick and never let's you down. I know people will assume it's garbage because of the recent headlines but buy the album or download it and see for yourself! If your a long time fan or someone who just happened to hear \\"Gimme More\\" and loved it, you'll definitely want to pop this cd in and enjoy the ride..
B000RIHBIE|4.0|Sampling everyone from Green Day, Simple Plan to Rise Against and Blink 182, this is a diverse tribute set from the band. Not sure if the songs are tongue-in-cheek or just heavily influenced.  While energetic, can't touch the Does this look infected disc. That disc was truly original and closer to their roots than this. Enjoyable till their next outing.
B00005JO9J|5.0|For anyone who loves the show, or any drama based, doctor shows in general this is a must see. Grey's Antomy not only shows medical tradgedies, but peers into the life of new doctors and their personal struggles. This is a great show and the first season is one of the best.
B000UR9TQO|1.0|I agree with the poster that said that \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" was terrible. I saw them live in the 70's as well @ the LA Forum more times than I can count. This video is god awful and I hated it and still hate it.
0920668372|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot when I was younger.  I actually totally forgot about this book untill the other day when I heard the saying \\"Love you forever, like you for always, as long as I live, my baby you'll be,\\" on TV and it triggered my memory.  There's nothing better than your parents telling you that when your a kid and it's a good trigger when you hear it again.  I would recommend it to any new parent to read to their children, it will create good memories.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|My favorite types of music are dance, trance, and electro. I have previously enjoyed when other pop stars venture into these genres (Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" cd anyone?) so it is no surpise I am a big fan of Blackout. At first I wasn't sure how it would go, I loved \\"Gimme More\\" instantly, but it took a couple listens for the rest of the songs to capture me. Standout tracks are Gimme More, Piece of Me, Radar, Break the Ice, Heaven on Earth, Freakshow, Toy Soldier, and Why Should I be Sad. If you take this cd in the context of an upbeat, fun, dance-able album, you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for something deep this isn't it. No matter what is going on in her personal life, this cd is still hot!
B000W1V44I|4.0|I don't think you can expect aynthing else from the Backstreet Boys.  I think they ventured off a little bit, but if you heard any of these songs on the radio, you would know that it's them, becuase they always put their \\"signature\\" on each song.  I have been a fan forever, and I didn't listen to any of the tracks until the day the album was released.  It definately is a very mature album.  On every album, they seem to do that well... I love Never Gone, but I think this album is a bit better.  As we, \\"the fans\\" get older, they evolve with us.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|This season ended really abruptly (20 eps). There is a preview of season 4 that takes place after she's in th FBI. Good concept, but all previous characters have been washed, and there's a awkward relationship from the start. I predict season 4 would have floped.
B00005B364|2.0|Aside from the classic, Hocus Pocus, and a few guitar licks in the last song, this is a really dull, derivative and unoriginal album. Not recommended.
B000NA2776|5.0|I loved this CD!  I'm a 45yr old woman, and yes, the first thing I thought was Freddie Mercury.  What gets me about Mika and his style is that the music is so upbeat and bouncy, yet the lyrics are melancholy and full of emotion. There is an irony there that I find very appealing.   As for \\"My Interpretation\\", he could have been singing about a relationship I am currently navigating.  I love that Mika is courageous with the music, the lyrics and with his vocal range.  I am really appreciating this music.
B00005JPFH|2.0|In my opinion, Spiderman 2 and 3 were a huge dissapointment. Do not waste your time and money on this DVD, this movie was terrible. I saw this in theatres, hoping it to be really good, but no, it wasn't. It was all just [..]. Don't get it. Maybe worth a rent though.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I am a gigantic fan of Annie Lennox.  Maybe because we share the same pessimistic world view.  While this is maybe not her best album, it sure has enough great songs to make it a valuable addition to my ipod.  Thanks Annie for all your support.  xxoo
B0001XAPY2|5.0|If you're familiar with Miyazaki's previously-released films, Porco Rosso might seem like a departure. Set in the Mediterranean in the early 1930s, it follows the adventures of the title character in a style borrowed from Saturday-matinee serials (the kind of thing George Lucas based Star Wars on) and the tough-guy films of Ford and Huston. That is, if you can imagine those films in the kind of gorgeous color Miyazaki drenches his scenes with here, and if you can imagine Humphrey Bogart with the face of a pig. It's partly by this free mixing of genres that this film identifies itself as Miyazaki's--as well as by the recurrent themes of flying, lonely heroism, responsibility, truth and integrity that mark all of his films. And then there are the air pirates, back again. Here, they're the object of free-lance fighter pilot Porco Rosso's crusade to keep the skies safe for schoolgirls and the other innocents who inhabit this alternative history of the pre-War Mediterranean. When the pirates hire an American ace to bring down the Red Pig, the action takes off, and as we learn that the Pig's history involves an obscure curse and a hopeless love affair, the plot soars and twists with as much agility as a dogfight above the blue Mediterranean. Thrilling, wistful, beautiful, funny, thoughtful, nostalgic and warm: it's another Miyazaki! ...
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the most amazing albums of the decade. Gold is some of Ryan Adams' finest work, and is well worth the listen.
B00005JPUL|2.0|Jack Finney's famous story, which is the basis of Don Siegel's classic \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" is remade again with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Considering the names involved in this new project, including German director Oliver Hirschbiegel known for his outstanding \\"Downfall\\" and \\"The Experiment,\\" the 2007 version should be a great thriller - the producers must have thought so, and so did I.    Nicole Kidman is Carol Bennell who realizes that something weird is going on in the city of Washington DC where she works as psychiatrist. For the reasons that I should not reveal here, Carol knows she should not sleep in order to protect her beloved son Oliver from \\"them,\\" but I think you know the original story. Sorry, but this is the only part I was intrigued during the film. Oh, but I like the \\"vomits\\" part, though.     Unfortunately the newest version misses every chance to be a good if not better adaptation of the great story. This time it is set in a bigger city and the film also (rather unnecessarily) touches the subjects like a tragic space shuttle accident, but the film moves on with a hectic speed without fully developing the meaning of the new settings. An interesting \\"What if\\" scenario is certainly there - are we still happy when we stop hearing any more news of war and terrorism in this way?     However, the story is more \\"rushed\\" than \\"slick,\\" going from one scene to another without taking time to building up the atmosphere of impeding dangers, so the results are boring (and familiar devices like barking dogs and nods to older versions including Veronica Cartwright's character do not help much). What is worse (for me) is the concluding chapters where Nicole Kidman's character is seen driving a car madly like Kurt Russell in \\"Grindhouse.\\" The stunts themselves are great like any other Joel Silver films, but I expected to see something entirely different.    But perhaps that is the way Oliver Hirschbiegel may be feeling about the film, which, according to IMDb, went through re-shooting. We may be able to see another and hopefully better version of the film and until then, two stars.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|After seeing the movie Once, I came home and immediately ordered the soundtrack. This is a second album by the couple who starred in Once. Yes, there are some duplicate songs, but the music is so wonderful I don't care. One CD for the car; the other for the house.
0307275639|3.0|There is not much in depth to the way this book was written; it is a simple written book about the reflections of a life and life lessons learned; some people need to read it in order to live it ; unfortunately some people don't get it until the end of the road; I always think that we could learn a lot of wisdom from talking to those older than us ; I hope people get the message to live, let go of ill will and forgive ; the basic message of the book.  My lack of stars is mainly how the author wrote the book not the message.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|The movie is a creative and more accurate portrayal of the novel.  Coppola's commentary track and extra \\"how to\\" material make this a very edifying and personal DVD.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Far and away the best show on television.  Soon to be the best television series on blu-ray.  If you're still looking for a reason to adopt, this is it!
B00004RF98|4.0|The movie is timeless and fun.  It would have been great to have a commentary track and some other extras.
B000002J1U|5.0|This is possibly the ultimate Led Zeppelin compilation of unchartered acoustic folk songs tuned in the key of D major and G major..open tuned.  Very clever ideas put together by the sheer genius of Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones along with the somewhat brilliant lyrics of Mr.Plant.  So early in their musical careers.    Brilliant stuff lads!    Adrian Trott.
0440238609|1.0|Pullman spoiled a good fantasy story by incorporating his well documented hatred of Jesus & Christianity.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a poignant and even haunting DVD.  This movie, by Erroll Morris, is based on his interviewing Robert McNamara, late in his life.  Interviews are interspersed with archived material to provide punctuation.  The end result is quite powerful.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of the interview with historical scenes adds a considerable power to this DVD. McNamara was about 85 at the time he was interviewed.  His responses to questions are measured, but there is always a sense that he is trying to grapple with his own role in historical events such as the Vietnam War. He certainly does not apologize for his actions, but there is a sense in this movie that his reflections are part of his own internal struggles over historical events.<br /><br />The well discussed \\"lessons\\" raised during this movie have some value in themselves.  However, they are useful in gaining a greater sense of McNamara's views and the internal debates he appears to be experiencing.<br /><br />His feelings about John Kennedy's death are quite real.  His eyes throughout this movie are compelling to watch.<br /><br />This DVD moves quickly.  The cumulative result is powerful.  Whether or not one ends up feeling positively or negatively about McNamara, one does end up gaining some real insights into him and into the times in which he played such an important role.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|The lovely Britney is back at it again. I realy like her spirit and no I do not have much of a thought on how she choose to experience her life. I like her music and that's it. This album is real good, she is great at entertaining, and do her thing well \\"you go girl\\". I enjoy give me more and track two with track five like I said in my title Mrs. Britney is back at it again.
B00005JPRD|5.0|Maybe it helps to have lived through the 1960's (there has to be some consolation for being this old), but this movie moved and reached me on a visceral level.  I'm from Boston, went to Princeton in the 1960's, and spent some time in NYC and the Village during the Dylan/Baez days.  It was 'deja vu all over again'.  The Beatles music sounds as good now as it ever did, which is very, very good indeed, the visuals were breathtaking, the characters were likable and talented.  I've always been an early Beatles (old-time rock and roll, pre-drug sound) fan, but the movie made me listen and think more deeply about the later era of their music, to my enlightenment.  This was a movie you could listen to with eyes closed and love, watch with no sound track and be amazed, and when you both watch and listen it's a feast.  I plan to see it at least once more and buy the DVD.
0440238609|3.0|I'll make a very short review about my experience with this series. I must have been 14 when I read the first book, and I was really impressed. This is a really good book for young adults, and so the older folks' negative reviews are simply written by people who are too old and who think too critically and realistically to enjoy the book. Sadly, however, at one point in time I also got \\"too old\\" to enjoy the rest of the series, because the installments took forever to arrive. I was 16 when the second book came out and for a long while after the 3rd book wasn't published. So, you can imagine that once I was 18, children's fantasy wasn't really my genre anymore.
0751532711|4.0|This is the first book that I can say has changed my life. I read it while I was in the hospital for one week. When I came out of the hospital and went back to my office, I realized that I was the poor Dad that he mentions in the book, even though I was head of the company and was very well paid. I have read it again and what I cannot forget is when he tells us to ask ourselves,,,it is not \\"I cannot afford this\\" but \\"How can I afford this\\"!<br />My wife and I have our own business now, have set goals for the short and long run, and are happier than ever. We have more time to spend with our kids!<br />It is an amazing book! I go around recommending it to others and giving it as birthday and Christmas presents
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|You got to have this album.  Its clear that when you hear it you leave behind her personal life and you find yourself with the Britney we all know, the one who lives for music.  All of the songs are amazing! And plus, read all the reviews from professionals and you'll read the same things! Buy it, you won't regret it
B000URDEB0|4.0|In my review of 2005's \\"Once\\", I focused on two musical strengths that Nightwish had developed; the album's variety of sound, ranging from celtic-inspired melodies to raw metal tracks; and the over-the-top symphonic bombast that made each song sound like a Tolkien battle scene. Songs like \\"Ghost Love Score\\" made any other symphonic metal creation sound dated and halfhearted.<br /><br />But now we have that album's successor, \\"Dark Passion Play\\", which, like Porcupine Tree's \\"In Absentia\\"/\\"Deadwing\\" duo, attempts to both copy and one-up itself. It's almost as if the band structurally analyzed \\"Once\\" and then injected it with performance improvement meds. Though not without its flaws, the album has proven itself with the 7 - 10 spins I have given it.<br /><br />Many fans will criticize the band's decision to adopt a more mainstream voice to their line-up. To such comments, I will say: though I was always a fan of Tarja's operatic pipes, I like the change for two reasons:<br /><br />1.) Tarja's booming voice was very limiting. Though a good match for the epic metal the band was concocting, it would not have fit with more accessible, standard hard rock tracks.<br />2.) Her voice was already becoming less and less operatic album after album. The voice we heard in \\"Wishmaster\\" wasn't the same one coming across in \\"Nemo\\".<br /><br />For these reasons (and of course, the ongoing personal drama that often spills into the music) I fully endorse Anette Olzon. She has the range, the power and the intensity to sing songs both old and new. For validation, look no further than the album's opener, the near 14-minute behemoth \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\". I'm not a fan of epic tracks starting albums (see: Riverside's \\"Out of Myself\\", Draconian's \\"Where Lovers Mourn\\"), but after the first two minutes of this song's spiraling tempest of horns, strings and choirs, all is forgiven. Once again (pun intended), Emppu Vuorinen's guitars play second (more like fifty-second) fiddle to the orchestra, serving almost only as a metronome to the symphonic ensemble.<br /><br />As a song, \\"Poet\\" puts previous symphonic epics (\\"Creek Mary's Blood\\", \\"Ghost Love Score\\") to shame. With spoken word passages and a story all of its own, it provides an intense dramatism that succesfully guides the song along its multi-part path. I would honestly recommend this album for purchase for this track alone. It's my favorite track of the album and will reign in the annals of epic metal songs for years to come.<br /><br />The album overall follows the same format as \\"Once\\" or Kamelot's \\"The Black Halo\\" in that the first third of the album is spectacular, the second third is forgettable and the final third making up for the lackluster middle. We have many melodic heavy-hitters up front (\\"Amaranth\\", the electro-heavy \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\"). Afterwards, we have a hard-rock song that could easily have gone the way of the recycle bin (\\"Master Passion Greed\\"), a painfully slow ballad (\\"Eva\\") and two songs that I always skip (\\"Sahara\\", \\"Whoever Brings the Night\\"). Then the final third of the album rewards listeners for enduring the previous four cuts. \\"The Islander\\" is a beautiful acoustic number with various singers, centering around a primarily celtic melody. \\"Last of the Wilds\\" is an instrumental piece that is very reminiscent of Amorphis' \\"Relief\\" - folk, instrumental, fast, melodic. Finally, \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\" and \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" kick the orchestra into overkill, sending horns, flutes and strings into every single beat, accompanying Marco Hietala and Olzon in a competition for attention.<br /><br />\\"Dark Passion Play\\" is, at its simplest, an inflation of \\"Once\\". They make better what worked in the previous album, and for some reason, make worse what didn't. Despite these imperfections, Holopainen and company have crafted an intense album that will ultimately survive the public scrutiny that surrounded its production. I give it two thumbs up... as long as I can fast-forward to the end.<br /><br />See also: Nightwish - \\"Once\\", Therion - \\"Sirius B\\"e also: Nightwish - \\"Once\\", Therion - \\"Sirius B\\"
B000LXH0AE|4.0|With Will Farrell you never know. But he pulled it off. I'm a logical thinker, like most of the reviewers. But for this movie I just disengaged, suspended belief & enjoyed. Harold is a really boring, compulsive, numbers crunching IRS agent. Suddenly he hears a voice in his head. It's noted author, Kay Effiel, writing her latest novel. He is the protagonist. How this happens isn't explained. But she always writes tragedies. Harold must die. But he doesn't know this at first. He consults with a shrink, no help. He then meets Professor Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Harold convinces him of his problem & they start trying to figure out who it is & what going to happen. Harold rather suddenly starts to change his life to shake things up.. He starts dressing more causually, takes up  the guitar & most importantly, falls in love. Obviously he wants to live. The professor tells him he must die for the sake of literature. Eventually Harold tracks down Ms. Effiel for their final showdown. This is  short review & I've missed a lot of detail but the scenes with Hoffman are worth seeing this movie. So check your reality at the door & enjoy.

B000F3T7X8|4.0|Well, first let's get my bias out into the open. The two best tracks on this Japan CD are \\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\\" and \\"Taking Islands In Africa\\", although neither compares to my favorite Japan track of all time, \\"In Vogue\\" from the \\"Quiet Life\\" CD.    The \\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\\" CD is more moody New Romanticism from one of the true pioneers of the genre. Mick Karn's fretless bass playing got/gets a lot of press, but Japan's true genius is in David Sylvain's voice and lyrics.    Any fan of New Wave should own this album.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Having listened to it on the radio, now without all the talk around the tracks, I have greatly enjoyed the collection of songs and arrangements.  Bruce's voice sounds stronger and more melodic than ever; it shows emotion and depth.  Quite the magical hour.
B000UFAURI|4.0|It's not [[ASIN:1193943873 There Is Nothing Left to Lose]], but it's still great - probably better than [[ASIN: 1193944144 In Your Honour]].  BTW this 'product link' thing needs work.  HTML tag support wouldn't hurt either.
B000UFAURI|5.0|Wow!  After all these years of great albums, it is even more surprising to listen to a very strong set of songs that rock and are never boring.  There might be bigger names out there, but no one band consistently delivers the rock goodness as the Foo Fighters.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Big, loud and topical.  Slightly underscored by the 10,000 other politically-themed albums released in the last couple of years though.    Amazon IT people:  a little better Firefox compatibility please.  The product reviews, tags (below), and the rating thingy (above) are all b0rked.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I will admit that when I finished listening to the album once threw, I was rather disappointed.  \\"City of Evil\\" is one of my favorite albums to come out in recent memory.  I listen to that album front to back and never get tired of it.  So I was pumped to get their new disc.  After living with it for a couple of days I am really starting to dig it.  I am stoked to see band's taking risks and incorporating other genres into their music.  As an avid music fan and musician I tip my hat.      I would recommend getting this disc and give it sometime before passing judgement.  While I did take a look at the 2 reviews posted before I bought the album, I'm glad I didn't take their advise.  At first 'weak' is what came to mind but now I am truly enjoying their new work.  Happy listening.
055358202X|4.0|I can understand the fans' panic, as we begin to imagine Book 17 of the Song, with Daenerys STILL on the other side of the ocean, Arya and Rickon and Bran STILL wandering, everyone in the Iron Islands STILL thoroughly disagreeable, Tyrion STILL unavenged, Jaime STILL unable to draw his sword without lacerating himself, Sansa STILL muddling about in an emotional coma, and Cersei Lannister and Walder Frey STILL not painfully dead.<br /><br />But lets remember why we glommed onto this series in the first place: because Martin is NOT Robert Jordan. Martin is unafraid of killing characters. Martin can make characters not sound like other characters. Martin can write dialogue that possesses actual wit and humour, rather than folksy-sounding colloquialisms and musings that would bore an avid fan of Dora the Explorer.<br /><br />So let's believe that while, yes, he's wrestling with some sub-plots, he really does have an end of this series in sight, and any hiccups on the road there will become the exception, rather than the rule.<br /><br />Now on to the actual Book: Love the Cersei plot, she's as incompetent as she is cruel and self-absorbed; and her downward spiral is a pleasure to be inside of. Jaime's movement towards the Light is likewise a joy -- no scene in the series still gives me as much pleasure as his drunken dungoen conversation with Catelyn Stark in CoK, and it's fun to see him develop into what he could become. Liked watching Sam begin to grow a pair as well. Even enjoyed the sojourn in Dorne, especially Doran Martell's venting of his rage and heartbreak. Brienne I find a bit dull (though her tales are illuminating), and I do wish that the Iron Islands would sink beneath the waves and take Asha, Euron, Aeron, and the whole dang crew with them. Other than that, our only hope is for Victarion to finally lose it and kill them all. Also wish he'd let Arya stop suffering, but I suspect this may come soon.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing where Bran and Rickon have gotten off to, and Tyrion and Dany as well. When that happens, I may share my predictions for Books Six and up.and Dany as well. When that happens, I may share my predictions for Books Six and up.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|The animation is great but the film has no story. I purchased this to view the graphic beauty but came away empty. It is not too deep to understand, just disjointed sort of like a group of clips put together as outtakes and assembled to make a sort of story. It may make a good rental if you're really into animation but don't expect to see Final Fantasy The Spirit Within which has a superior story and voice acting but not quite as realistic an animation style. I would give Final Fantasy VII Advent Children five stars for animation and just about zero for story. That equally a one star movie to me.<br />Some people familiar with Final Fantasy 7 may find this to be an excellent film. You are correct in that I never researched the movie and don't feel I have to play a game to understand a storyline. It was because I wanted to see what was described as amazing animation (which it is) that I viewed this film. But that doesn't mean the story for the average viewer like myself is going to be good. I watched the whole thing and found it interesting visually, that's it. The remainder of my family including my kids who are game fanatics either left the room from boredom or fell asleep. I feel I am middle of the road on this. So I guess I can give the movie a 2 rating for eye candy only, instead of the 1 rating which I felt the majority would give. Comparing this movie to Final Fantasy Spirit Within which I think is very good in both story and visuals, I found Advent Children to be seriously lacking.
1400032717|5.0|What I enjoyed most about this tale was the way it gets inside the head of one suffering from autism, giving us the understanding that a person with autism is still a human being, who may see the world in a different way than \\"normal,\\" but who has ideas and feelings and perceptions all the same. And we also realize that Christopher, the main character, has observations of the world that are both insightful and thought-provoking. I believe that much of the world around us is based upon our perception of it, and the innocence in which Christopher sees the world, and the analytical way in which he examines everything, is a refreshing perspective that should give us all food for thought.<br /><br />I won't go into story details as there are plenty of reviews here covering that already. Suffice it to say that \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a book I think everyone should read.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, author
B000UR366S|5.0|So here is the new album by Joni Mitchell in ten years.  Let your little lights shine and rejoyce, Joni Mitchell is back. To me she never was gone though, since her records rarely quit my CD player.  Releases by Mitchell are more than albums, or more than just mere new collection of songs ; each time, they first of all represent major artistic events, and secondly different milestones in her life : musical witnesses of where she is versus where she was -sending us back our own mirrored image simplified, to paraphrase this wonderful line from the lyrics of &#34;Refuge of the Roads&#34;-, precious flashes of the present times where this unique poet, woman, musician and painter stands (we all know that she wishes that &#34;painter&#34; would be mentionned first since this is what she primarily was and still is, but I'll indulge into the lady's musical side right now, since &#34;Shine&#34; is the topic of the day and not canvases -my apologies, Mrs Mitchell!!)  For the real fans-at-heart  who wish they'd know what &#34;Shine&#34; ressembles or sounds like before buying it (but any fan at heart would buy it without knowing, wouldn't they?), wondering whether &#34;Shine&#34; bears any similarities to previous works (which would be unconceivable coming from an artist who never repeated herself twice), or at least how it could be positionned in the galaxy of gems that Joni Mitchell released before and so far, well, it is true that there is an undeniable flavour coming from the Roses, between other things... Let's put it that way : this time the Lady from Saskatchewan sent us roses (tinted with the blues of despair) with a mighty wink from a certain Reckless Daughter, while the latter was drawing some Chalk Mark in order to Tame some wild life's Tigers dying under the assaults of all the junk killing Mother Earth... If you don't get the riddle (but I'm sure anyone can, as it's such an easy one), &#34;One Week Last Summer&#34; has the grace, pensiveness and gentleness from &#34;For the Roses&#34;, just as &#34;Strong and Wrong&#34; is close to &#34;Roses&#34; in some ways, musically speaking.  &#34;If&#34; has indeniably be musically written by our own Reckless Daughter (even if the lyrics are only partially hers, but it is truly amazing to see how Kipling could not have found a better spokeperson, as his words do sound like pure Mitchell's!), &#34;Night of the Iguana&#34; -besides being one of the album's best track-, wears the energy of some of the &#34;Chalk Mark&#34; era (&#34;Snakes & Ladders&#34; for instance), and &#34;Bad Dreams&#34; (the best track with &#34;Shine&#34; and &#34;If&#34;) is a righteous and logical prolongation of some of the most introspective efforts from &#34;Taming the Tiger&#34; (&#34;Stay in Touch&#34;, &#34;Face Lift&#34;).  This being said, the whole album is like any previous Mitchell's releases: very much her, although surprising, musically adventurous (&#34;Shine&#34; with its so particular atmosphere and slow tempo is not like anything she has recorded before, even if the writing and ample structure are unmistakably classic Mitchell's), growing more and more on the listener.  &#34;Shine&#34;  aknowledges the fact and makes certain that Joni Mitchell, no matter what, in her youngest age or growing older, in revolt, mischievously ironic or just broken-hearted, with something to scream (with her &#34;Dog eat Dog&#34; album for example), or with just a desilusionned statement to make (this particular &#34;Shine&#34; album), with her crystal mellowed voice of yesterday or her husky and half-broken voice of today, does remain the greatest and most moving recording artist of our times.  Reading the sometimes bad things she got on Amazon from disappointed listeners (not mentionning the editorial review which sounded unbelievably biased and expeditious to me), I must say that I was left a bit perplexed by those critics.  &#34;Shine&#34; is not only a beautiful, elegant, unusually creative album on its music side, but also is certainly one of the most coherent, intelligent, direct, straighfoward, courageous piece for what it says and contains. I was amazed to read people complaining about Mitchell caring for whales declining, and not for people dying out (which is not even what she exactly said, plus!), and I certainly will not try to convince here with my own words just how Mitchell's position is right, lucid and accurate : if her own brillant words failed to do so, mine as poor as they are will have thus still lesser success obviously. But such responses just show how right she is to be pessimistic about the survival of mankind, as some people don't seem to realize that disappearing whales -between other things- imply a disappearing Earth, and that there is no point in making children who will make mankind still heavier on this planet when that very planet on which these children will stand and will try to feed from, will simply not be here anymore to sustain them... it's just common sense, but apparently Man's egotism and his own specy's selfishness and blindness prevent him to use his brain and open his eyes. I am glad that Joni Mitchell is so wise, simply wise, and has eyes and brain for those who definitely lack both (&#34;the zombies in shopping malls with their cellular&#34;, between others  - if only for this line, &#34;Shine&#34; merits to be listened to!)  Joni Mitchell has already opened her mouth in the past (&#34;The Fiddle and the Drum&#34;, &#34;Three Great Stimulants&#34;, &#34;Ethiopia&#34;, &#34;Tax Free&#34;,  &#34;Lakota&#34;, &#34;Sex Kills&#34;, &#34;No Apologies&#34;, etc), and she continues to do so. People who blame &#34;Shine&#34; should better listen again to her previous recordings that they claim they loved, and would then realize there is just a coherent woman continuing to inform, warn and protest against the disgraces of the world. Except that this time the message is just a little more desperate and harsh than before, but is not the situation alike?  I was moved, to finish, by this artistic choice that Joni Mitchell made in reproducing on the CD itself a night view of the Earth, so beautiful, sparkled with the cities's night lights... small light bulbs, small witnesses of the energy of a doomed world?.  Thisreminded me her lines in &#34;Refuge Of  The Roads &#34; in &#34;Hejira&#34; (her absolute masterpiece with the rest of the quadrilogy &#34;Hissing of Summer Lawns&#34;,  &#34;Don Juan's&#34;, Mingus&#34; and, and, and... I'll stop here the list, most of all other efforts by Joni Mitchell would deserve to belong to that category anyway!), when she was then considering this picture of the Earth &#34;taken by the astronauts coming back from the Moon, this marbled bowling ball where no one could see anything, not a forest, a city or a highway, and her in her car the least of all&#34;... Thirty years later, we still cannot see Joni Mitchell on this picture, but her voice, her music, her intelligence and the enormous heart that she pretends that she doubts having now (but we all know how big it is in reality), are shining through, reminding us the fragility of this marbled bowling bowl, and dazzling us with the force of her talent, a force so great that it does light up a little hope in all that darkness. Irrationnal light, but quite luminous indeed.  Let her little light continue to shine on us, lighting up our insights, so that we can keep on the fight.
B000002UAU|5.0|Where do you go once you've reached the top?    There stood the Beatles at the end of 1966, having just released their greatest album yet (\\"Revolver\\"), \\"bigger than Jesus\\" in the words of John Lennon, and exhausted from years of virtually non-stop touring.  Their first decision was to stop touring. Permanently.  A monumental decision considering that the Beatles were, of course, the most significant band in rock and roll history.  This turned out to be a wise decision, allowing them limitless time to focus on recording a new album.      Flying back to England after a vacation in Kenya, Paul McCartney devised the perfect method to resisting the strain of Beatlemania, the perfect way to escape from the millions of screaming, obsessed fans, unyielding in their devotion to the Fab Four.  \\"It was my idea to say to the guys, `Hey, how about disguising ourselves and getting an alter ego, because we're the Beatles and we're fed up,'\\" McCartney said in 1987, in an interview conducted by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine.  \\"Why don't we just make up some incredible alter egos and think, `Now how would he sing it?  How would he approach this track?'\\"    Using one of his new and most experimental compositions, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" as a springboard, McCartney, with John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison, returned to Abbey Road Studios in London, England, and set about recording their eighth album.  Intrigued by the notion of a concept album, an album in which the songs combine to form one theme or story, the group began recording on December 6, 1966.  129 days later, they finished recording, and on June 1, 1967, the Beatles released their masterwork: \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" the greatest album of all time.    \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" was the first rock album taken seriously by critics and the general public.  When the `60s began, rock music was hardly taken seriously.  At the decade's end, it had become an art form, and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was rock at its most artistic.  The Beatles didn't set out to make \\"Revolver 2,\\" nor did they necessarily set out to top \\"Revolver,\\" their previous album, released in 1966, in which they pushed the limits of rock and roll with a number of intricately-structured, creative songs.  They were the greatest band in the world at the peak of their popularity, and that gave them the freedom to do anything imaginable with \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"      They did everything imaginable, and then some.  There was no area of artistic expression the Beatles didn't explore on this album.  They created an album thematically united like none before.  \\"This is going to be our 'Freak Out!,'\\" Paul McCartney said before the album's release, referring to Frank Zappa's debut record, released in 1966 and widely regarded as the first concept album.  Scrutinizing \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" one notices how seamlessly each song leads into the other, how logical a transition it is from the high-flying \\"Getting Better\\" to the concise and organized \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" or from the spiritually reflective \\"Within You Without You\\" to the cheerfully meditative \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"  \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" has it all, even the crashing sideshow number \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" which John Lennon virtually transcribed from a 1843 circus poster.    If that sounds creative, rest assured there were no limits to the innovation of the four musicians from Liverpool.  The music of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" went far beyond the crafty, explorative pop of \\"Revolver\\" (or any previous Beatles work, for that matter) and entered a new realm, a realm bursting with lush color and intricate arrangements.  The Beatles started playing with a variety of new instruments, like the clarinet (the crucial support for McCartney on \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\") and the harpsichord (on \\"Fixing a Hole\\").  They explored new territory in recording technology, inventing a variety of techniques that would be expanded upon for their future albums (particularly \\"Abbey Road,\\" acknowledged as one of the most crystalline recordings in rock history).  They added an endless loop of gibberish to non-U.S. vinyl pressings of the album to finish it off.  John Lennon even added a high frequency tone which appears before the \\"madness loop,\\" a tone which is too high-pitched for human ears to pick up.  However, Lennon felt it should be added to irritate the listener's dog.    Even the album's artwork was revolutionary.  Designed by Peter Blake and created by Robert Fraser, the front cover depicts the Beatles as their alter-egos, a collection of musicians which play in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.  Surrounding them are cardboard cutouts of celebrities and historical figures, ranging from Marilyn Monroe to psychologist Carl Jung.  (Adolf Hitler, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus Christ were also planned for the cover, but they were deemed too controversial.)  The lyrics for all of the songs were printed on the back cover, a first for a rock album.  On top of that, the album came with a page of cut-outs: a moustache, a picture card of Sgt. Pepper, stripes, badges, and a stand-up of the band.  Never before had such attention been paid to the artwork or the craft of a record.    Certainly the Beatles pushed the bounds of rock music on \\"Revolver,\\" but it was on \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" that they marched up to the walls surrounding rock music and kicked them down.  No record before or since is more historically important than this, because after \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" there were no \\"rules\\" for rock: anything was possible.  Author and journalist Geoffrey Stokes wrote, \\"Listening to the 'Sgt. Pepper' album, one thinks not simply of the history of popular music but the history of this century.\\"  The Times critic Kenneth Tynan declared the album \\"a decisive moment in the history of Western civilization.\\"  Many people who had never bought a rock album made \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" their first.  Prominent publications began publishing serious pieces upon rock albums.  After \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" rock music was taken seriously.    If there is one album you absolutely must have, one sole required record, it is this.  \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is the peak of creativity, as well as the magnum opus of the greatest musicians of all time.  Forty years later, Sgt. Pepper's band plays on.

031286504X|3.0|Sure, I will admit that I Am Legend was one of the better vampire stories I've read, but something was missing. I suppose I could say I'm among the readers who thought it was too short. When I picked up this book, I guess I was in a hurry or I overlooked something, but I didnt realize that I Am Legend is really just a short story among others in this book. And though the other stories are great, I only picked up this book for I Am Legend. Good story, interesting premise, but still it was over too fast. Maybe I'm speaking too soon, but the movie looks to be one of the few movies to surpass thier book counterparts.<br /><br />But we'll see.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I can't say that I was surprised at how good this was.  I saw the trailer and I just knew that this movie was going to blow me away.  From the opening gritty black and white introduction to the climax I was in cinematic heaven.  It's funny because when a film receives so much attention prior to its opening it is usually a bad thing, but when the only attention the film is receiving is the mixed words over the color of the lead actors hair, well then you have to take into consideration that know one knows anything yet.  Daniel Craig is blond, yes, but he is also the best Bond in the series, seriously.  He's dark, mysterious, charming, handsome, buff, bright and just about the best thing that has ever happened to the spy thriller.<br /><br />In `Casino Royale' we meet Bond for the first time.  In the opening scenes he's earning his 00 status which means he has to make two kills, which he does in a very violent and gritty fashion.  What `Casino Royale' was able to do, by starting at the beginning, was establish Bond all over again, recreate his character to be more palatable.  We are able to reexamine his charm and his pride.  The Bond represented here is a bit softer, not as callused as those in the previous films because it is this film that defines Bond, that molds him into the man he is today.<br /><br />The film was smart in the way it handled the adaptation from the Ian Fleming novel by building up to the poker scenes as apposed to consisting mainly of them.  The novel read a little slow but the film is so fast paced and intense it's brutally good.  Aside from the action sequences (which are all phenomenal) it works very hard to make each and every character real to the audience, most notably Bond and his partner Vesper Lynd.  This is due to the brilliant performances by both Daniel Craig and Eva Green.  Daniel reinvents Bond beautifully and I'm sure will continue to develop him as the franchise takes off.  Eva Green is just utterly flawless here, breathing so much life in Vesper.  She is by far the most mature and well rounded Bond-Girl to ever grace the screen and she deserves major credit for giving the film a sense of warmth and reality.  The other performances are also well placed, especially that of Judi Dench who reprises her role as M.<br /><br />What I admire about this film is its ability to prove superior to the rest in its genre.  There are so many action/thriller type films but rarely do they ever reach this magnitude, this level of perfection.  The action scenes are flawless, the acting is award worthy, the script is tight and coherent, the set pieces are brilliant designed and the direction is astonishing.  In fact I can't pick out a single flaw.  Even my wife, who I literally had to drag to the theater, loved this movie.  In fact she made me take her back to see it a second time and insisted we purchase it the minute it was released on DVD.<br /><br />As far as the DVD is concerned, the extras are worth the price of the disc.  The behind the scenes featurette with Daniel Craig discussing his training for the film and such is a great extra, one that is entertaining and worth watching.  It's funny because it's rare that the extras on these DVD's ever really interest me, but I must say that I watched these and enjoyed them immensely.<br /><br />So, bottom line is that `Casino Royale' quite frankly may be the best Bond movie yet.  It's certainly the most polished and entertaining since the days when Sean Connery carried the title.  Many were skeptical of Craig's ability to pull this off but I'm here to say that Daniel Craig is better than any Bond so far in his ability to not only carry out the amazing stunts involved but also make this character real to us for the first time, making Bond someone we understand and admire.per.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|As much as I hate to admit it, this album is EXCELLENT. In fact, it is absolutely my new guilty pleasure. I've honestly just had it on repeat and it's been playing for hours and I'm in no way sick of it. It's upbeat, different, and makes you want to get to a club...maybe that's why she's always out--She's listening to too much of her own music! The album just has a really good feel to it and moves from song to song very fluidly and nicely. I love all the different beats behind every song--very unique to Britney and makes her who she is.    Definitely check out \\"Oooh Oooh Baby,\\" my favorite of the bunch. Every song you can imagine being blasted at a club. This girl's still got it!
B000TUXL2A|5.0|As a middle aged man, who also happens to be a guitar player, it was inevitable that I would be drawn to Mark Knopfler after hearing the first few bars of a song many, many years ago called Sultans of Swing.<br /><br />At that time, of course, Mark was in a band that would later go on to become one of the biggest and most popular bands in the world - Dire Straits.<br /><br />After the eventual breakup of the band, Mark pursued a solo career - and what a career it has been..!!<br /><br />I've always said that Mark Knopfler may not be the BEST guitar player on the planet in terms of technical ability - I know there are lots of younger players out there who can tap out thousands of 64th notes in the span of 2 or 3 seconds with both hands.<br /><br />But if there is a more tasteful player on the planet, frankly, I've yet to hear him.<br /><br />Mark Knopfler is an incredible musician and songwriter, who just seems to get better and better with the passage of time. You listen to the songs on this album - as well as his other - and he's like an artist who can evoke the richest colors and the most beautiful hues with both his voice and his guitar.<br /><br />I don't know of anybody who can create such intimate character studies and evoke the kind of emotions with his music as he can. And his ability to coax the perfect note or chord - and the PERFECT tone - at the most precise time in a song is, in my opinion, unparalleled amongst musicians/ songwriters.<br /><br />Knopfler has been criticized for his relatively limited vocal range. Personally, I have never had a problem with his singing - his deep and comforting, baritone voice is like a fine 24 year old scotch going down for the first time. It's a perfect compliment to the incredible tapestry of tones and riffs that his guitars and fingers conjure up.<br /><br />In common with his other recent solo efforts, I was luke warm about Kill To Get Crimson when I first listened to it. Again, it was very \\"laid back\\" in terms of the tempo and the absence of guitar solos was instantly apparent. I found myself waiting for a beautiful guitar solo a la \\"Darling Pretty\\".<br /><br />However, as I repeatedly listened to it while driving to work, it just sounded better and better - which is EXACTLY the same phenomeon that happened while listening to his other recent albums. And the \\"need\\" to want to hear a guitar solo diminished with each listening - I was very content to hear the melodic guitar play a \\"secondary\\"  and subdued role.<br /><br />While younger guitar players perhaps feel compelled to have their guitar \\"front and centre\\" to appease a younger audience, Mark demonstrates remarkable restraint and the guitar is allowed to compliment the story that's being told - and not DOMINATE it. Mark Knopfler doesn't have to prove he's an incrdibly gifted player - he did that a long time ago. He has nothing to prove anymore.<br /><br />This is a rich, textural album put together by a consumate professional and master songwriter. As well, Mark is ALWAYS smart enough to surround himself by incredibly talented musicians. And with this album, he again is playing with many of the same very talented people who he has worked and toured with for many, many years now. Clearly, they're very comfortable with each other.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would have enjoyed this album as much if I were a 25 year old man. I can perhaps see why a younger person might listen to this album and ZZZZZZZZZZZ.<br /><br />But you reach a certain age where you're able to clearly make a distinction between the steak and the sizzle.<br /><br />And this album is another 5 star, filet mignon from a musician / songwriter who is just a pleasure to listen to. The news that Mark Knopfler has another project in the works or a new album release is imminent is now becoming a very anticipated moment for me each year or two.<br /><br />Perhaps my generation was spoiled by the wealth of timeless music from the 60's - Beatles / Hendrix / Dylan / Rolling Stones / etc that the bar is now set so high for us that very few are able to match - never mind exceed - our expectations.<br /><br />If so, it's nice to know that there are still people out there like Mark Knopfler, who consistently can put out some of the most enjoyable and beautiful music around.<br /><br />This cd gets my highest recommendation - do yourself a big favour and treat yourself to this gem - you won't be disappointed..!ectations.    If so, it's nice to know that there are still people out there like Mark Knopfler, who consistently can put out some of the most enjoyable and beautiful music around.

0143038419|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is titled simply with three verbs.  Any writer knows verbs carry the action, and Gilbert's verbs let us know her book focuses on action--the pleasure of eating, the meditative discipline of prayer, and the conscious self-determination of loving self first, and then loving others. Why were these actions important to Gilbert?  The life she had been living no longer worked.  She had lost her capacity to experience pleasure, she had no spiritual base, and she was close to suicide.      Gilbert does whatever it takes to regain balance.  She commits to a journey of self discovery traveling to Italy for pleasure, to India for prayer, and to Indonesia to integrate pleasure and prayer.  She structures her narrative in threes and multiples of three; three-word title, three countries, three books divided into 36 chapters representing 108 beads of the japa mala (Hindus necklace used for praying a repetitive mantra).  Each book represents one missing aspect of her experience; pleasure, prayer, and love.     Book one, written in Italy, narrates Gilbert's past life full of depression and despair.  She comes to Italy for relief from that life, for relief from societal expectations of career achievement, marriage, and children.  She recalls a night of crying on her bathroom floor in New York when she decided to pray. God answered her in her own voice, which directed her with wisdom and common sense.  \\"It was merely my own voice, speaking from within my own self.  But this was my voice as I had never heard it before.  This was my voice, but perfectly wise, calm and compassionate (p.16).\\"  This spiritual insight tells her god is not distant, but found within, in her own intelligence, her own instincts, and her own ability to care for herself.  She is in charge of her own healing.    In Italy Gilbert pursues pleasure--the pleasure of learning Italian for no practical reason, but because she enjoys the sound; and the pleasure of eating exquisite foodwith abandon.  To keep life simple and focus solely on her individual pursuit of pleasure she chooses celibacy, and acknowledges the ironic humor of that choice.  After a while, and some delicious pizzas, her singular commitment to pleasure begins to heal.  She stops crying and sleeps again.     Book two is written in India.  Gilbert seeks austerity and devotion in an ashram, but does not forget her sense of humor when describing her struggle to incorporate meditation, chanting, yoga, and Sanskrit into her daily routine.  She presents characters from the spiritual community to the reader.  Richard from Texas is unforgettable.  He nicknames her Groceries because of her healthy appetite.  Richard's dialogue is not what the reader would expect of a spiritual seeker, \\"Me and Groceries, we steady be laughin' the whole damn time\\" (p.139).  Gilbert's voice is light but her insights are powerful.  Her spiritual experience is grounded in humanity; her deepest insights are born in the body.    In book three Gilbert continues her spiritual journey in Indonesia.  But now her journey becomes a union of pleasure and devotion. When she asks her guru Ketut about meditation he tells her to learn to smile \\"even in your liver.\\"  His simple advice is that meditation is being quiet and smiling deeply--all the way down in your liver.  Gilbert gets a spirituality grounded in the body.  This balance is what she had been looking for.  Now she is able to take on relationships--Wayan the healer, and Felipe the Brazilian.  Wayan decides Gilbert needs a man.  And Felipe, a sexy, loving older man materializes.  Gilbert waivers before she decides to have an affair with him.  When she allows herself to be loved she completes the journey she began from the bathroom floor.  She has let go of her old dutiful life in which she had followed the dictates of others, and now embraces her new life based on her own choices.  A happy memoir.

0061544493|5.0|I just love this book.  I have the hardcover version, purchased from Amazon UK, so I am not quite sure what the paperback will bring, but I think it's worth a review.  I wouldn't say it's a true style manual; rather, it's one woman's love affair with clothes, make-up, and accessories, no matter what the cost, high-end or Land's End.  It's written in a very warm, friendly tone, almost as if the two of you went shopping for a day and took a break for lunch.  There are really nice illustrations and some fun candid photos of Mrs. Beckham that bring life to the pages.  This isn't a book to read if you're looking to put together a wardrobe from scratch; instead, it's something fun to page through if you're stuck in a rut, maybe looking for an idea or two, and wanting to see how much fun it is to be extravagant.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|When I look back at the crop of movies we've had this past year, Stardust stands out for its ability to transport us to another realm - one where fantasy, folklore, magic, adventure and romance commingle in an enchanting blend that makes for a memorable movie-watching experience.<br /><br />Stardust the movie is based on Neil Gaiman's novel & graphic novel of the same name and though this movie is unable to capture the full magic of the written/illustrated works, it is nevertheless a commendable effort that is pure magic and a feast for the eyes and senses.<br /><br />The story centers around the sleepy English hollow of Wall which is separated from the magical realm of Stormhold by a wall. One night, the dying king of Stormhold [Peter O'Toole], undecided as to which of his three remaining sons should succeed him, releases a ruby necklace into the night sky which promptly knocks down a star which takes the form of Yvaine [the luminous Claire Danes]. Thus begins an epic adventure - the king's sons vie with each other [using murderous means] to obtain the jewel, a band of three aging witches led by Lamia [the deliciously evil Michele Pfeiffer] lust after the star for its' heart would return their beauty and youth to them, and a besotted young man from the village of Wall, Tristan [newcomer Charlie Cox] seeks out the star for he has promised to bring it back to win the hand of a shallow village lass Victoria [Sienna Miller].<br /><br />Not to give too much of the plot away, the movie moves along at a steady pace, but it is after the two leads fall into the hands of a band of pirates in an airborne ship, led by Robert de Niro [in a hilarious turn] that the movie truly picks up pace with a blend of humor,adventure and magic that makes it a cinematic treat to watch.<br /><br />The casting in this movie was generally well-done - newcomer Charlie Cox brings a certain level of innocence, misguided ambition, and courage to his role as the young Tristan, and Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as the evil witch Lamia. Robert de Niro is surprising and hilarious in his turn as Captain Shakespeare, and Claire Danes, is beautiful enough[ and this is definitely a role that requires a glowing kind of beauty], though she does seem stilted at times in her role as the fallen star.<br /><br />I loved this movie - having seen enough violence-themed movies this past year, action flicks with brainless dialogue, corny comedies, not to mention gross gore movies, Stardust was in a word, refreshing. Pure magic and romance with witty dialogue, and gorgeous sets and scenery. Highly recommended!ia.

B000053W5D|5.0|I have watched this adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility more than a dozen times since it was released, and it never fails to enthrall me. It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot[ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.<br /><br />The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship to each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.<br /><br />The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [a gorgeous English rose, Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.<br /><br />Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.<br /><br />The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters, who may be deemed minor roles, certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.<br /><br />Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.tainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.

B000KRN07S|4.0|The music is what you get on the unenhanced CD, vintage Norah with several of her best tracks yet. My favorite is 'The Sun Doesn't Like You' - very dark, threatening, totally non-specific, with this really neat strong music (vocal and instrumental).    I hoped for one or two different songs on the DVD (you get that on her first DVD), but that doesn't happen. I'm not a great fan of videos. These are far better than most (visual quality, concept, execution), but I'd have been happier with more of the rehearsal footage,or small-house concert ...    And I'm picky.

B000UR9T8C|5.0|all of the Spider-Man movies are action-packed, and Spider-Man 3 is no exception. in the end, Venom gets blown up and then the New Goblin and Sandman get a conscience, and then New Goblin dies. I recommend this movie to those who are superhero buffs, and I hope that they make another Spider-Man movie
B0000009UG|4.0|I'm not actually a big Bowie fan. Those early pop songs, well, you can take em or leave em. Yet there is some damned indefatigable thing which glues this album together so well, I am often found (to my total surprise) playing it more often than I can really understand why.<br />Sure, there's the popular Ashes to Ashes, but why am I still listening to the grimacing wail of Bowie as he \\"painfully\\" wretches his soul apart in \\"scream like a baby\\", when albums by lesser mortals would have been coffee cup coasters long before? It's painful to listen to, it's painful to put up with, but, man, does he sing it like it sometimes is!<br />It \\"gets to you\\". The angst of this album is its drawcard. It spits at you, growls at you, curses at you (in Japanese) and tells you to shut up!<br />Well, Dave, I gotta just keep listening.<br />P.S I love that line in Fashion (and every time I see those dopey brain dead girls strutting their stuff on stage with ridiculously bland faces) I think of a line in the song \\"we are the goon squad and we're comin' to town beep beep!\\"<br />Really, this is a great album, more than standing the test of time.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|She has few nice tracks on there like: Gimmie More, Get Necked, Heaven On Earth, my absolute favorite and Should I be sad.    She got this retro vibe throughout her tracks and to me, it's something diffent out of the norm.   I really enjoy listening to this CD.
B000002VRZ|4.0|I saw The Outlaws supporting The Who (and Little Feat) at Charlton Football Club's stadium The Valley in June 1976 and was blown away. I didn't know much of the band from before but Green Grass And High Tides, featuring what seemed like 5 or 6 guitarists (!) was just awesome for its epic guitar interplay. A few months later I was a dedicated punk rocker, reverting to three-chord trickery for the foreseeable future but I always kept a soft spot for virtuoso electric guitar playing (hence Tom Verlaine's Television becoming a favourite in the punk era). Looking (or rather, hearing) back after 30 years, Green Grass sounds as good as ever - and I've since cultivated a taste for country-rock (via the belated discovery of Gram Parsons), making this collection both a journey into the past and a welcome voyage of (re-) discovery.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Okay I know many people have said this already but this show just goes back to basics.  I'm sick of all the far out big budget super hero movies that have been spewing out in cinemas.  Yes this show is predictable but hey... nothing beats good ol' Bruce getting his revenge on the bad guys who kidnapped his daughter.    The best part of the whole show is just watching how he makes them regret their actions because you know he'll never die and that he's going win win win.    The only down side is the exaggerated aeroplance scene (don't want to reveal too much), but overall, the traditional action and butt kicking makes up for it.    Buy it as a good brainless thought free movie night.
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground formed in 1964.  From 1964 to 1966, the group became inventive and managed to team up with artists like Andy Warhol and Mary Woronov and form the Exploding Plastic Inevitable.  This led to touring around the country and eventually the fashioning of their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico in 1967.  In 1968, the group split from Andy Warhol, Nico and The Plastic Inevitable and released the album, White Light/White Heat.  Both albums were innovative and intense for their time boasting from fairly quiet sounds to extremely loud ones.  Then, Lou Reed and John Cale were butting heads with each other as far as decision making.  It's hard when you have two musicians like these, (each of whom are bull-headed) working together.  Neither one likes being told how to make his own music.  The tensions between Lou and John were so intense that eventually, one of them has to leave.  In this case, it was John.  Later on in 1969, the group recruits a new musician, Doug Yule to play bass, organ, and do some vocals.  Also, this led Lou to mellow out on this collection of songs.  On the self-titled album, (also known as the Grey Album), the mood is quieter. This allows Lou to express more emotion.  The song \\"What Goes On\\" boasts a moderate drum tempo by Mureen Tucker, an efficient organ background by Doug, a somewhat bag-pipe guitar solo by Sterling Morrison, and of course Lou's smooth guitar playing and lyrics.  It is a definitive rocker.  The same thing can be said about \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" which has great acoustic guitar sounds.  The following songs are slow but not at all boring:  \\"Candy Says\\", \\"Some Kinda Love\\", \\"Jesus\\", \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", and \\"I'm Set Free\\".  \\"The Murder Mystery\\" is the biggest surprise.  Here you get to hear Lou and Sterling in wich their voices overlap each other.  Then you hear Doug and Maureen sing lines back and forth.  Plus, you hear an innovative use of the organ where Doug sometimes vibrates the keys.  Towards the end, the song changes to repeated piano keys, while Lou and Sterling once again having their voices overlap one another. \\"That's the Story of My Life\\" is the shortest song of the album but is well-paced with all musicians blending all instruments together at a moderate tempo and a fairly soft tone.  In the song \\"After Hours\\", you just have Lou playing guitar and Maureen singing for once.  Her voice my not be up there with someone like Celine Dion, but it is adequate.  I don't think Lou was expecting a pure and radiant singing voice from her.  Throughout the album, you hear sounds which are reminicent of the doo-wop groups as well as artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.  But of course, Lou does not try to imitate them.  He attempts to see how they apply to his lyrics.  Moreover, the subject matter is anything but family entertainment.  The song \\"Candy Says\\" I'm told tells about a man who does not enjoy his own gender and has a burning desire to be a woman.  In \\"The Murder Mystery\\", you have all these descriptive and surreal lyrics depciting tha aftermath of a murder that took place.  In the song, \\"After Hours\\", you have a not so fortunate person inside a bar just trying to make the best of things and wanting the front door shut until the day is done.  Hopefully, the next day will be better.  Once again, I think The Grey Album is where Lou Reed expresses his more tender side, but at the same time keeps the listener tuned in.  Even though the album is quieter, it's still a masterpiece with lots of intensity.  This intensity is evident without the benefit of extreme loudness and distortion so prevalent on the bands previous two albums.  It's just too bad this album like the other Velvet albums, did not sell, even though I'm told that the critics back then praised it.
0385341067|5.0|I looked up the island referred to and found that the background conflict in this book over the copper mining in Papua New Guinea is an actual event.  The book is very thought prokoving, but an easy, restful read, even with the sometimes disturbing subject matter.  It was eerie to read that the whites and the rest of the world had forgotten them, and then to read in Wikipedia that the western press has more or less ignored this war.  How strange to get news of more or less current events in a work of fiction...
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It is fabulous to have this new platinum edition for the Jungle Book - my favorite Disney movie growing up. So many years later it's just as good as yesterday, in fact better now with the new remastering. I watched it for the first time on VHS as a kid, and it's wonderful to see how good the movie looks on DVD.<br /><br />My daughter saw it for the first time and adored the movie and I was captured by Baloo the bear's antics once again. This time round I noticed so many things that I had not noticed as a kid... especially the diverse accents of all the characters - the vultures have British accents, Kaa the python has an Indian accent, King Louie the monkey sings beautiful soul. These are the little touches of genius that make the movie what it is...there is something just so good and endearing about this movie. It not only brings you closer to nature but also teaches some valuable lessons about life along the way. The songs in the movie are some of the best of any Disney movie with catchy tunes that will have you tapping your feet and singing along every time you watch this movie with the kids.
B000N4SADC|4.0|a few weeks ago i caught a link off a keyboard blog that showed Hiromi in action on the tube.  very impressive.  her skillful use of her digital synth got me to dust off the old nord lead.  her heated passion on the piano was obviously miles beyond anything i could hope to emulate.    this is my first cd purchase, and for all the world it seems strongly reminiscent of return to forever.  maybe better than the quartet's classic third album.  perhaps the only thing missing was a switch to fender rhodes.  i'd be very surprised if Chick Corea hasn't visited her during performance or in the studio.    all in all a very impressive disc, with the extra star left dangling with the suspicion that an artist of this calibre might be capable of greater dazzlement and perhaps more memorable composition.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I love this album! It's so catchy. Im singing along and dancing to all the songs! Britney did it again!
B000VI04HK|2.0|The musical performance on this CD/DVD set is great and proves once again that R.E.M. is a stellar live band.  The visuals on the DVD are really pathetic, however, making this by far the worst of their four live DVD concert performances.  While their first two live DVDs (tour film and road movie) were visually arresting with wonderful projections, and the third DVD (perfect square) presented a reasonably straight forward record of a live performance, R.E.M. live is a non-stop visual gimmick which is nearly unwatchable.  It's too bad that the band does not have enough faith in their music to realize that these ridiculous visual tricks aren't needed to provide an exciting video experience.  The video, unfortunately, seems to confirm the viewpoint of their harshest critics that the group is creatively bankrupt. A few specifics: 1) Peter Buck is a wonderful guitarist but has to be the least interesting performer who ever stepped on a stage.  He seem to spend a lot of time with his back turned to the audience, but I doubt they're missing much; 2) Michael Stipe should consider learning some new mannerisms; 3) the band has such a huge number of wonderful songs, it's too bad that they keep recycling much of the same material for their live performances; 4) Slightly off topic, is the band so hard up for money that they have to license their songs to garbage like the \\"Chicken Little\\" movie?
B000EWBKK8|4.0|The world will be inherited by gunrunners...everyone else is too busy killing each other.<br /><br />One of the many messages Lord of War tries to get across.<br /><br />Not a family movie by any means, but worth checking out because of the conflicts around the world the movie touches on - particularly in wortorn and utterly ravaged Africa.
B000V1MMLI|5.0|Imagine classic SOAD without the silliness but still fun. There are lots of pleasant surprises from the female vocals on some tracks to the musical flourishes etc.  I leave you to pick up the album and discover them all. It is well worth it.
0099765217|5.0|Fight Club is one of those life-changing books that seem to come along once in a generation.  It is a symbolic postmodern parable about the disconnection from our true selves that occurs due to the loss of our own individual power to shape the world.  The book condemns our world and ourselves as much as it attempts to liberate us.  Incredibly Nietzschean, Fight Club is more about our internal fight with spiritual desolation than about the fights that we have with each other.  A must read.

I can't find one good thing to say about it.    ETA:  Ok, I listened to it again and there at least 3 good songs on here.  So I did find one good thing to say.  Still not nearly as good as his first 2, but not terrible.
6305428271|1.0|Louanne Johnson really needs to stop patting herself on the back for her work as a \\"teacher.\\"  She was not a teacher - she was a SUBSTITUTE teacher, one who quit after only a few months.  People like Luanne Johnson are the exact OPPOSITE of what students, especially urban students, need.  She was just one more person who walked out on them.  The real heroes in education are those who stay in the fight with their students, managing to balance their passion for education and dedication to their students with the necessary evil of jumping through beaurocratic hoops.  This movie is a farce.
B000WQW988|5.0|This is the best unplugged performance ever and one of the best live acoustic recordings from the 90s. It was all recorded in one take, not like other unplugged concerts from other bands.    This is pure honest live music at is best, a legendary performance indeed.  A must have for anyone that enjoys good music.
B000001DQG|4.0|The measure of an album, IMO, is not the higher number of above average tracks, or the lower number of \\"not awful\\" tracks, but rather the number of truly memorable tracks. There is plenty of crap on Caribou.  The Bitch is Back -- hailed by others -- is weak IMO.  If you want rock 'n roll or funk or whatever, look to another artist.  Elton John's genius was with ballads.    Don't Let the Sun Go Down is truly memorable.  The outstanding production, the great melody and chords and the vocal performance make the weak lyrics immaterial. To me, this is his second best recording -- only Rocket Man is better.       Ticking is absolutely unforgettable.  Completely unexpected, unusual and artistic because of the way his piano riffs match the mood and lyrics.    I've Seen the Saucers is the least of these but still a memorable track.      Were there more great songs on GYBR?  I'd rate Harmony above Saucers, but GYBR below Ticking and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.  Bennie and the Jets is pop fluff, and Saturday Night's Allright for Fightin is ok, but again, R&R was not Elton's strong suit.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Just picked up their CD last night at Best Buy. Can't stop listening to their music. Even though they lost 1 band mate, and actually he didnt sing anyway, they are still the original boy band that keeps on moving ahead.[[ASIN:B000W1V44I Unbreakable]]
B000Y179KO|3.0|Yeah the music is great. The sequencing flows superbly. A welcome release after so many years. *****B-U-T*****, boy I hate being held hostage by a band telling us we can \\"only buy this at Wal-Mart\\" !!!! There is a local CD store (one of few left) that I have frequented for nearly 20 years. Or maybe I would have wanted to purchase it on Amazon , or maybe someplace else. That's the point--choice. Anyway , I digress. Yeah , the music is great. Sounds just like you would have imagined the Eagles to sound. Their voices are still intact, and the harmonies are some of their best ever. I just wish I had a choice on where to buy it!
B000MXPE74|4.0|The Fratellis are yet another one of the bands that are a part of the indie rock explosion that has been going on for the past two years or so. I don't remember exactly how I came across them (it was probably on the Tonight Show), but their debut full-length album Costello Music ain't bad.<br /><br />The album's title may or may not be paying a tribute to a prolific musician known as Elvis (and to those who can't figure it out, no, not Lisa Marie's father), but whatever the case, the album has some pretty catchy tunes. Such tunes include \\"Baby Fratelli\\" and \\"Henrietta\\". But the best tracks would have to be \\"Creepin Up the Backstairs\\" and \\"Flathead\\". Also good is a revamped song from their self-titled EP, \\"The Gutterati\\".<br /><br />The band also does a good job storytelling, as evidenced by the interesting two-in-a-row of \\"Vince the Lovable Stoner\\" and \\"Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night\\". With only a couple of bizarre missteps (\\"Doginabag\\" and \\"Got Ma Nuts from a Hippy\\"), Costello Music is a very impressive debut. But I wonder what version of the album I have because I keep hearing a number of people mention a song called \\"Cuntry Boys and City Girls\\", but I don't see that song. Oh, well; this is still music to my ears.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000UJ48U4|4.0|1999 was a pretty big year for movies. From the groundbreaking effects of the \\"Matrix\\" to the phenomenon that was the \\"Sixth Sense\\" to the \\"Phantom Menace\\", the first Star Wars film in 16 years, it was quite an eventful year. In addition to that there was \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", the latest film by influential director Stanley Kubrick, his first in 12 years and would end up being his final film. It of course got massive hype: from the fact he was finally making something new, to the star power of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to its long shoot (400 days), excitement was huge and it can be fair to say disappointment was bigger. It's a fine film sure but it might not be everyone's idea of Kubrick's last hurrah.    Bill and Alice Harford are a married couple of 9 years with a 7 year old daughter, Helena. Attending a party at a friend's place, the 2 of them separate and start to flirt with partygoers looking for a more intimate setting. They both decline and the next day, Alice reveals a truth: a one night stand she desperately wanted to have happen a year earlier that she didn't act on. This sends Bill on a journey through the streets of New York and exploring that possibility of being with someone that's not his wife but what he discovers is potentially more dangerous than just infidelity.    The advertising made you believe that you were getting into some completely raunchy and X-rated with sex scenes and nudity running rampant. Turns out most of the nudity isn't played in scenes of sexual nature but just natural part of life and one's body. As for the sex, well, it looks explicity but you've probably seen worse. With this much press and speculation, you can practically see the audience's eyes giving a sense of shock; \\"that's it?\\" on their minds once the film's over. It's a slow, deliberately paced film with many characters chatting to each other with nary a mind-warping \\"Star Child\\" sequence or a hyper-edited sex scene to the William Tell Overture. This makes it more dreamlike but people might find it boring.     With a star like Cruise in the lead role, some might find it distracting. He's gotten to that \\"superstar\\" level of acting where people see him less as an actor and more like a celebrity who just so happens to be an actor. While there is moments that seem \\"Cruise-y\\" in the film, it happens to be one of his more layered characters, along with Frank Mackey from \\"Magnolia\\". But it's Kidman who probably has the more interesting role to play since by the end of the film, you still can't get a handle on just what exactly this characters wants and whether what she says is the real thing. But this is the Bill show as we spend more time with him than Alice which is kind of a shame.    Although it may not have that must-have status that a lot of Kubrick films have, don't think that it's a bad film because of it. It may not please everyone but it's at least a fine film on its own and a strange but fitting end to a long career.
0440238609|1.0|This series is the anti-Narnia.  Research this author and his beliefs before buying this.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|In 2002, Mustaine remastered the debut Megadeth album, Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!, including three extra bonus tracks and a new album cover completely different from the original. Inspired by the positive outcome of the re-release, he worked to remaster all of the subsequent Megadeth albums which had been recorded with Capitol Records (up to 1999's Risk).    Rust in Peace was re-released in 2004 with a new sound and four new bonus tracks. During the audio mixing process, Mustaine found that the original lead vocal tracks for \\"Take No Prisoners\\", \\"Five Magics\\" and \\"Lucretia\\" were missing - he had no choice but to re-record the vocals on \\"Take No Prisoners\\" and use alternate takes for \\"Lucretia\\" and \\"Five Magics\\".
B000LXH0AE|4.0|The first twenty minutes of this film had me somewhat bored but i hung in there and was pleasantly surprised.  will farrell is impressive and it's nice to see a side of his abilities that does not scream slapstick.  emma t could polish shoes and make it entertaining, so that goes w/o saying.  the relationship between maggie g's baker character and farrell's harold is off-beat and believable.  look for an almost unrecognizable tom hulce as harold's useless IRS in house shrink.
B0009MAO46|5.0|When Toy Story was released, nothing like it had been done before.  An entire movie created out of CGI.  Coming off the heels of Disney, PIXAR was a fledging company trying to make a name for itself.  Toy Story more than did the job.    First, the film is 5 stars.  An absolute masterpiece in every way.  The characters are surprisingly real, even when there's nothing real about them, except for the wonderful voice-over work.  Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are absoutely wonderful as Buzz Lightyear and Woody.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well.  One of the best children, no, movies off all time.    The two disc 10th Anniversary set includes a number of great extras.  Deleted scenes, a couple of nice featurettes, and a video game \\"The Claw\\" are packed in this wondeful set.    Must Have.
B000T2PRF2|5.0|Once again Diana Krall has put out a great CD. I know its just a greatest hits CD but its nice to have all her best songs on one CD. Stop waisting your time reading my stupid review and buy the CD. You will be glad you did.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Toy Story 2 is the perfect sequel.  It recaptures everything from the first movie but still is able to up the stakes.  The main characters return but a slew of new, and as interesting, charactes show up.    While ANdy is away at camp, Woody finds himself in a new pickle.  A toy collector kidnaps him and introduces him to Roundup Gang.  It's up to the rest of the toys, led by Buzz Lightyear, to recover Woody before Andy returns home.    This movie is great.  It's great in every way.  It's nearly a toss up as to which Toy Story you prefer.  They're both great movies.    The two disc set is as packed as the first one.  There's deleted scenes, and outtakes.  Also, a sneak peak at picture's next feature, and a new game \\"Which Toy Are You?\\"    Highly recommended.
0743201140|5.0|This is an excellent book for all levels of managers. I am reading the book and reviewing it with the managers in my portfolio.  Not only has it been helpful to me to learn their strengths it has been a real eye opener to them to realize how their strengths effect their work and how they have been successful in the work they do.  I think it has also given them confidence in knowing they don't have to fix their weakness but grow their strengths.  They are all very eager to learn the strengths of the people on their teams.  I would highly recommend this book.
B000BCE918|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase. I love the Jurassic Park movies and now I have all three in one set. Very cool box.
B000VS6P9Q|2.0|I have purchased this soundtrack prior to the film release but as a stand alone product I think it proves once and for all that nobody does Dylan better than Dylan himself.    Unfortunately he aint the worlds greatest performer on film so i accept a movie about him can easily make for better entertainment without him actually being in it, so I do hope the film is better than the soundtrack.    Different music I know but the Beatles covers soundtrack to the movie \\"I am Sam\\" was in my view an excellent covers effort. True to the songs, performed with respect and admiration. That soundtrack makes you want to go back and listen to the originals.    With this soundtrack I would bet any punter out there who can strum a few chords on a guitar could match most of the versions on display here in their own bedroom with a dylan songbook on hand. Seriously much of this sounds like some weird Karaoke contest. Sorry to say this but Antony & the Johnsons version of Knocking on Heavens Door creates a mental image of a distressed whale communicating to the rest of the pod somewhere out in the pacific ocean. I just dont see the \\"art\\" in it. Antony's song on the Leonard Cohen tribute doco \\"Im your man\\" is much better so its not as if i dont like Antony.    I would suggest even Dylans Self Portrait album is better entertainment than this. Both are equally hard to listen to. In fact this soundtrack would have made much more sence if it were called Self Portrait 2. Now that would be \\"art house\\".

Yeah, they may have some pressure to produce good music and albums, but it gets a little old hear the same old \\"I'm so tired...I'm so overworked.\\" Whatever...they chose the career path.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical when I read this book. I was thinking, \\"Oh here we go...\\" but again...I was surpised by how much this book kept me wanting to read more. Maybe it's the sadist in me...I don't really know. But this book went deeper than the \\"I have an addiction and I can't / won't quit\\" schema.  Very good book indeed.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|If you are the type of person who loves vigilante justice or believes in an eye-for-an-eye, you will love this series. Michael C.

As serious as the subject of murder is, I felt like this season was a fun and easy watch. Can't wait to watch season 2!

B000002I8H|1.0|I received this album from a friend, and was expecting a nice refreshing take on the Beatles by one of the greatest Jazz singers that the 20th century ever heard. Instead, I discovered horrendously unfitting arrangements that neither suit Sarah's voice nor the Beatles' compositions. The dated ARP Synthesizer sounds for one are very distracting and kitschy, and so is the rest of the instrumentation throughout the album.   Creed Taylor used to make formula style albums in the late 60's and 70's under his CTI label, and sometimes the formula worked, and sometimes it didn't, but the majority of his albums were listenable. This album was produced by Marty Paich - who once recorded a fantastic series of arrangements to Jazz standards with Mel Torme. On this project, I would say that he is totally out of his area, and the result is very kitschy, and does not stand the test of time or good taste.

0316018953|3.0|Connelly is a master at not telegraphing where he is going and actually injecting some genuine \\"whodunnit\\" in his \\"whodunnits.\\"  Unfortunately, he was not able to completely escape the constraints that the NYT magazine placed on him when he originally authored this story as a serialized 16-chapter version for their periodical.  This one just doesn't quite have the cadence and sense of being propelled that are characteristic of Connelly's other novels.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - it's worth reading - but it just isn't one of his best.  It's also a bit shorter than usual - I polished this one off in a single evening.<br /><br />Classic Connelly is to tell us whoddunit about three-fourths of the way through the book, and then provide an unexpected twist in the last few chapters.  It's a sort of double crescendo that Connelly fans know and love.  We don't get much of that here.  It's a fun read, but without that tried and true recipe that Connelly so masterfully employs in most of his other books.  Here, we encounter an older, but only slightly more mellow Harry Bosch as he unexpectedly meets up with his old flame, Rachael Walling of the FBI, at the crime scene.  Bosch is back with the LAPD as a homicide detective and together he and Walling form an uneasy alliance to pursue first an execution-style death, and then some missing radioactive material that is connected to the victim.<br /><br />While a decent read, it was a bit like watching a widescreen movie on my 4:3 aspect ratio TV.  It can be made to work, but you know it wasn't intended originally for that medium.<br /><br />I'm hopeful his next effort will be better, because it won't likely be encumbered by the same constraints.  Connelly succeeds here, but it is in spite of the original medium he was writing for, not because of it.
B000UNYJXQ|1.0|I actually prefer my fiction to be fiction and my documentaries to be non-fiction.  I have never been a fan of taking the truth and stretching it to where it is no longer recognizable.  And Michael Moore has taking stretching to a new art.<br /><br />If this was listed under fiction I would have given this 4 stars, it is colorful and imaginative but alas it isn't quite what it is advertised to be.  Unfortunately the trend in Hollywood is to label the \\"in\\" thing as being factual and list it under documentary.  If you are not familiar with the subject, you would be ill-advised to take Moore's word on anything and look for information in more respectable places.
0446310786|5.0|The simplicity of childhood is captured wonderfully through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a single parent (her mother having died before she remembers) struggling with the pressures of setting his children the right example in a world governed by rigid rules, bigotry and prejudices.    The first half of the story centres around the flow of life for Scout and her brother Jem, painting a picture of a childhood idyll. The cruelty and complexity of of the world breaks into the second half as the children witness the consequences of their father defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.    The freedom of a child's mind to observe what IS without judgment or malice gives this story it's power. In many ways each character is archetypal, representing that particular set of characteristics that we see in people but often prefer to ignore when they make us uncomfortable. The blind bigotry exhibited by many of the characters is still with us and speaks volumes about those of strong religious belief yet absence of true humanity and conscience.    A beautifully written yet powerful book I would recommend that everybody read.
B000E41MRC|3.0|To write a review or to even discuss Leni Riefenstahl I think is a tricky subject. I don't have to tell most people she is a controversial figure. Yet most people struggle between throwing praise at her work while keeping in mind the content of her work. In a way it is relateable to her ideas that politics and film are seperate.<br /><br /> \\"Triumph of the Will\\" basically shows us a Nazi rally a year after Hitler and the National Socialist Party have taken power. And unless you have the volum turned off, I don't think it is terribily difficult to tell this man could cause lots of trouble.<br /><br /> But what about the way Riefenstahl films the rally. From the opening shot when the heavens bring us Hitler as a massive crowd awaits their leader, Reifenstahl hits home the idea of power within the party and the German people. And that's the most prevelent element in all of Riefenstahl's work. Strenght in numbers, discipline and youth. We get a lot of that in this documentary.<br /><br /> Is Riefenstahl right though that politics and film are two different things? In theory, yes. Film and politics are two different things but some would argue society inspires an artist. We are all products of our environment. Yet Riefenstahl says she was not a memeber of the Nazi party. She says her only intention was to make a good film. Was she really a Nazi? I have no way of knowing. She says she wasn't, so we can only take her at face value, although if not a Nazi, she was at the very least a Nazi sympathizer. And she was greatly impressed by Hitler. But how could she and so many other people not pick up on the dangers of the party? Just listen to Hitler's nationalist speeches, they reek of world domination. And this was years before the start of WW2.<br /><br /> Should you see the piece of Nazi propaganda though? There is definitely an element of historical curiosity to it. And it is well made, but, so what? I'm reminded of a line in \\"Annie Hall\\" when Woody Allen tries to take Diane Keaton to see \\"The Sorrow and the Pity\\". She tells him \\"I'm not in the mood to see a three hour documentary on the Nazis.\\"<br /><br /> If you do chose to see this you will probably be interested to see some of her other work. None of them is quite as \\"good\\" as this. Assuming there is such a thing as \\"good Nazi propaganda\\". With \\"Triumph of the Will\\" we see her growth as a director. Compare her work here to films such as \\"Victory of Faith\\" or \\"Day of Freedom\\". She really came into her own with this documentary. And I don't know if that is a good thing or bad.<br /><br /> Bottomon-line: Interesting documentary in a historical perspective but so what? Is it worth watching? Maybe. Ask yourself, \\"Am I in the mood for a two hour documentary on Nazis\\"?d the Pity\\". She tells him \\"I'm not in the mood to see a three hour documentary on the Nazis.\\"      If you do chose to see this you will probably be interested to see some of her other work.

B000K1Z3ZQ|5.0|I read \\"Things Fall Apart\\" in my school days in the then Rhodesia. I immediately fell in love with the book because I could relate a lot with tribal life in my village and the various forces that were impacting on it. The customs, rituals and beliefs were very similar. The impact of white missionaries on the lives of people in my village was also very powerful and caused a lot of clashes with the local people's way of life.

However, as we progress with reading the book, he is struck with tragedies which ultimately consume him because of his inability to cope with change. This book had a profound influence on me and made me appreciate the intellectual talent within the continent.<br /><br />The book is a must read for people on the African continent where strong traditional beliefs still have a firm hold in a time of breathtaking changes wrought about by the unstoppable globalization process. The ability of African people to stop or significantly influence the pace, direction and extend of change is very limited. The tragedies that befell Okonkwo are continuing but in different forms on the continent. This is largely due to the failure to adapt to change and failure to appreciate that, however much we firmly hold and justify some of our beliefs, we cannot force others to agree with us and if we try, we will fail anyway.<br /><br />An important lesson from this book is the echoing of Charles Darwin's conclusion that it is not the strongest of the species or the most intelligent that will survive in a changing environment, but those species that can best adapt to change.

B000I6WV9Y|5.0|\\"Built to Last\\" is an enlightening and interesting classic on business strategic management. The authors, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras spent six years in research and compared the practices of 18 visionary companies in the USA to those of a matched set of good, though not great, companies. Their fundamental observation is that average companies are driven by the power of \\"or:\\" You can have either short term profits OR long term growth, either stability OR progress. Visionary companies, in contrast, embrace the power of \\"and:\\" You preserve the core AND stimulate progress.<br /><br />The authors then methodically, step-by-step proceed to explain how great companies erect structures that embrace these seemingly contradictory goals. The great companies the authors studied, contrary to conventional wisdom, are not profit focused at their core but rather, they are `value' focused. These values are a sort of nucleus, around which leaders in visionary companies grow the company. This was the case in such great companies as Disney, Wal-Mart, Merck, Ford, Hewlett Packard, 3M, Johnson and Johnson and others.<br /><br />Among the core myths that Collins and Porras shattered are that visionary companies must start with a great product and be pushed into the future by charismatic leaders. Instead the great visionary companies they studied were characterized by total lack of an initial business plan or key idea and by remarkably self-effacing leaders. The authors are much more impressed with the great companies' almost cult-like devotion to a \\"core ideology\\" or identity, and active indoctrination of employees into \\"ideological commitment\\" to the company.<br /><br />The book is interesting to read, is humorous, is among the best, easiest to follow guide to strategic management. The book also provides guidelines to help managers at all levels to apply the concepts. It is well written with compelling case studies. I highly recommend the book to those looking for a practical down-to-earth book that is readable and useful.dable and useful.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|This is footage of Led Zeppelin at their peak period. The '73 tour, apart from the fact Plant's voice had already changed, is the best tour Zeppelin ever had. This film captures it. The sound is much more powerful than any other live releases, and the playing is perfectly typical of Zep in '73. It doesn't get any better. Certainly not the '75, '77, Knebworth, or early footage you get with the Led Zeppelin dvd. Don't be fooled by people who join the decades long critical bashing bandwagon. Some things get branded because it is easy to go along with the popular, yet incorrect, perception.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|What a wonderful film!  But, to the soundtrack:  The 31 Beatles songs on the Best Buy version of the soundtrack are heartfelt and nicely sung.  But what particularly impresses me are the instrumental backings provided by the musicians (courtesy T-Bone Burnett?) --- not radical re-workings, but subtle and luminous, nonetheless.  They will make you marvel anew at the undimmed brilliance of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
1582701709|3.0|Let me start by saying that there is a law of attraction and it does work every single time. We are all connected energies. That may sound a little too New Age for some people, but it is true nonetheless. It is magnetic energy that holds us to this planet and keeps the law of centrifugal force from propelling us into outer space. It is vibrational frequencies that allow us to listen to music on the radio or even contact friends on our cell phones. We do not see these frequencies, but they are all around us at all times. It is our energy frequencies that also connect us to each other. If you could see into the world of vibrational wave frequencies, you would see your like frequencies connecting to like frequencies of others and also to all of the elements of the known universe. Understanding this concept is the foundation to understanding the law of attraction.     There is something powerful and beneficial to be learned from every one of the contributors to this book. I personally consider Lorel Langemeier, Bob Proctor, Denis Waitley, and Jack Canfield to be treasured mentors. What I have learned through their books, CD's, and seminars has brought me immeasurable success in my life. However, there are some philosophical and logical difficulties in The Secret that you need to be aware of.    The first difficulty is the concept that God is the Universe. God is not the Universe; He is the Creator of the Universe. What has happened here is that science has made discovery after discovery that seem to point to the fact that the elements have some sort of intelligence. Dr. Wallace Wattles, author of The Science of Getting Rich and the inspiration behind The Secret, taught that there is a consciously thinking substance from which and by which all things are created, and that all things are made from this same substance. This is absolutely true except for the belief that the substance is conscious of itself. Even the very cells of our body are little intelligent beings. However, none of them are conscious intelligences. They are reactionary intelligences that are designed to work in harmony with the many laws of creation. The great mistake that Wallace Wattles and many of the proponents of The Secret are making is that they are worshipping the creation instead of the Creator. God used these same processes to create this universe, and He designed it so that we could use the same processes to be creators just like Him.     For those who believe that God is the Universe, I highly suggest studying the works of Raymond Moody, Melvin Morse, and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross. I would also ask that they look further into the philosophies of the Bible. They have found in it the process of creation, why not use it also to discover the character and nature of the Creator? God loves us all very much. Doesn't He deserve to be recognized for whom He is?    Another difficulty is the claim that because of the law of attraction we are responsible for all things that have happened in our lives. This is extremely illogical. First of all, the law of attraction states that we attract the image that we consistently maintain in our minds. When a woman is raped and beaten, does this mean that she has consistently thought of this until it manifested? If this is the case, then why prosecute the rapist? Weren't he and the woman in cahoots? When the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, were all of those people thinking the same thing? How many of the little children were thinking consistently about death? The more you think about it, the more ridiculous it becomes. There are other laws of creation than simply the law of attraction. There are laws of association and laws of community. We live in a sea of wills and we are affected by what others are attracting even though we ourselves have not attracted the same.     This brings me to the problem of singling out the law of attraction, while virtually ignoring the many other laws of creation. There is also the Law of the Spoken Word, the Law of Sound, the Law of Emotion, the Law of Sowing and Reaping, the Law of Consumption and Elimination, The Law of Association, and several more. All of these laws must work in harmony with each other. When we learn to operate them properly, we will become truly limitless beings on this plane of existence.     There are great truths to be learned in the teachings of The Secret, but one should exercise caution in regard to some of its more extreme philosophies. Other than that, it is a very well written, entertaining, provocative, and enlightening piece of writing.

B000NA28I4|5.0|I looked over many of the reviews here and am shocked to find how many of you have missed the point of this movie.  It's not the fight with Galbatorix or the Urgels or any of the \\"bad guys\\".  These are staples within the fantasy world as principally set down by Tolkien.  It's almost universally followed now.    What this movie (and the subsequent books) are about is the relationship between a boy becoming a man and a human-intelligent dragon.  It's about their developing relationship, the learning about each other, caring about each other, knowing each other's thoughts and feelings, and learning how to deal with them together.  Together they triumph, apart they are vanquished.      Watch the movie again and keep my words in mind.  Forget Tolkien -- he set Frodo on a far different path than Eragon takes.  Let the beauty of a relationship between a boy becoming a man and a dragon take you to a different element of fantasy.  If possible, read the books while listening to Patrick Doyle's soundtrack.  They go far deeper into the relationship than a movie can.
B000BTJDGC|1.0|This movie is a prime example of revisionist history; it trivializes the hard facts of the case and imposes a strong bias in favor of the supernatural. Throughout the film, the priest explains that his only wish is for Emily's story to be told; too bad the filmmakers didn't share his conviction. The real Emily Rose, a young Bavarian woman named Anneliese Michel, was subjected to 67 exorcism rituals over a period several months! She eventually starved to death, under the care of her parents and priests who were subsequently found guilty of negligent homicide.

B000W1V5VU|5.0|I am one of those people that absolutely loved [[ASIN:B000062XHI Ocean's Eleven]] and was extremely disappointed by [[ASIN:B0007P0XBO Ocean's Twelve]], not because the movie was all that bad, but because it could not even compare to the first one. I am happy to report that this new film comes much closer in quality to the earlier effort, and thus, is another winner. The elements are all there, a highly entertaining storyline, plenty of funny moments, a cleverly planned revenge and an impressive cast.<br /><br />There are a few differences this time around though. The plan involves destroying the empire of Willie Bank (Al Pacino), a ruthless casino mogul, who cheated Reuben out of his share of the hotel they were planning to open together. In turn, Reuben lost his will for living and is in a life-threatening state. The crew wants their revenge and to provide Reuben a reason for going on with his life. Therefore, this is a plan that involves no personal profit, well maybe just a little, but mostly the goal is to punish Bank. Another difference is that sadly, Julia Roberts is not present this time around. Finally, did you ever think that Danny Ocean and his friends will work together with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)? I didn't either, so brace yourself for a shock!<br /><br />From cheating at the casino, to initiating a revolt among laborers in Mexico, this movie has it all. The ingredients for having a great time are all present, and mixed in the right formula. The cast does an impressive job and the addition of Al Pacino, with an excellent performance, contributes to the overall quality of the final product. Fans of Danny and his team will not be disappointed!

B000V8I2QU|3.0|I read many reviews about the terrible mix, and thought to myself that they are probably audiophiles.  I purchased the album, and honestly if I haven't read the other reviews I would have thought that I received a defective CD.  I mean, I own remastered recordings from the 50's that sound better, and I am not kidding either.  The whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a tunnel or just on really cheap equipment.  On most songs Springsteen is unintelligible.  All the instruments play one on top of the others with a computer-like cheap sound.  You find yourself playing with the volume button, more treble, less bass, whatever.... Nothing helps, this thing just sounds BAD.  Now, I am a huge Springsteen fan, and I just cannot understand how nobody around The Boss had the guts to tell him to just not release Magic as is, and take the time to remix it.  Bottom line, if it was just a no-name artist and/or a mediocre album who would really care, but this is Springsteen, and Magic is a great album.  Unfortunately, the Production simply ruined the album and made it hard to enjoy
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's \\"The Lives of Others\\" is one of the best recent foreign films I have seen. Finally a film that shows how lives were invaded by what probably could be best described as East Germany's \\"Homeland Security\\". The Lives of Others is a very detailed description of how the German Stasi(secret police) operated, (unlike its predecessor, the German SS or SD of the Third Reich). Special laudits go the superb acting performances of Ulrich Muehe(\\"the eavesdropper\\"), Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck. The Lives of Others is a must for everyone to own.
0553278223|4.0|I've never read Bradbury prior to picking up this book for a class. Very intriguing stuff, and I'll definitely read more of his work if I get the chance. It makes for some great comparisons/discussions on imperialism, colonization and all that good stuff, while also immersing you in a completely new world. One of my favorite chapters was \\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" in which an abandoned house on Earth continues its daily routine of making food, cleaning the house, alerting its (former) occupants of the time and events, etc. Only towards the end do we see the silhouettes of the occupants as the only remaining paint on the side of the house; everything else has been seared away. An interesting look at what Earth could become, and the role that Mars or any other planet may play.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I'm pretty surprised by the amount of support and kudos that were given to this album. Is it safe to assume that most were written by hard-core Britney fans? A while ago I received a copy of this album. Obviously I was curious to see what the quality of the album would be like, esp. with the drama surrounding her personal life. It doesn't seem like a person in such a distressed mental state could possibly produce a decent album. Well, my instincts proved correct, I feel this album is a complete pile.     This album is SO heavily produced, even more so than her previous albums. Britney's vocals are basically non-existent. We all know that she doesn't have singing abilities but at least on previous efforts, she had ballads to showcase her \\"vocal abilities\\". On Blackout, her voice is completely synthesized on practically every track. It reminds of me of Zapp and Roger songs from back in the day. Her lyrics are lame and very elementary. \\"I'm Miss Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\"? As I continued to listen to the album, I felt is was such poor quality that I found myself tuning out and ignoring it all together. The songs all had  similar tunes and seemed to have the same style. It's as if you're listening to the same song over and over.     In all honesty, I'm not a big Britney fan. However, I've admittedly enjoyed some of her songs and feel that my opinion isn't biased. If Britney had taken this album a little more seriously, it could have been a big comeback for her. Instead, it leaves little to be desired and re-iterates her sagging reputation as a train wreck. It may debut at #1 but it'll hardly reach the same success she's accustomed to.
B000T05R8Q|4.0|The packaging is the first thing the buyer will be impressed with here, though -- despite some unfortunate omissions -- the musical presentation on these three CDs is also noteworthy. I'm sure it's noted elsewhere about how the album is presented in both mono and stereo on two of the disks. It's interesting to hear how most consumers heard this album back in 1967 though for my money the stereo mixes are still preferable, giving Norman Smith's layered production work greater depth and range. The third CD is of special value for serious fans since it collects some singles and B-sides plus outtakes from the recording sessions. My main complaint is actually with the otherwise expensive-looking book itself. It's nice to have a reproduction of Syd's mad 1965 scribbles, collages, and ramblings, but not even a cursory biography or history of the recording of this album are included, just lots of photos in a booklet that tore out of the binding after only a few listenings. Still, simply based on the historical value and impact of the album this one is worth owning.

0679735909|5.0|One thing that never ceases to amaze me is how much Byatt can pack into her work. So many allusions and references, but each is appropriate. I have to say that I'm a bigger fan of her short fiction, but this is by far the best of her novels. It can be a little slow at times due to all the information, but it really immerses you in the world of the novel. This is one I plan on re-reading more than once, and I'm sure I'll always find something I didn't see before. Great stuff.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I love old english time period movies so of course I had to give this one a try.  I absolutely loved it!  Although the main character is a children's writer, it is not a childish movie at all.  It is a fantastic romance story filled with innocence.  It was refreshing to be able to enjoy a movie without any unnecessary crude remarks that so often ruin movies now adays.  There are heartwrenching moments, exhilarating moments, and everything in between.  You should definitely give this movie a try!
1594489505|5.0|I add my 5-star rating to those of over 600 readers who have posted reviews thus far and declared this an excellent book.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is once again a very personal look inside the years of tragedy, cruelty, and oppression that the nation of Afghanistan endured in recent history.  First, a king deposed by his own cousin, then the Soviets, and then the Taliban, this nation and its people have seen the worst of human oppression and upheaval.  This book illustrates what so many people lived through by focusing on two fictitious women who grow up in very different circumstances, are about 15 years apart in age, and yet find themselves both married to an abusive and misogynistic older man.  You will find yourself rooting for them both as bombs fall on the city of Kabul, and wanting to know how either of them might survive the war and this loveless marriage that both were coerced into.      I am not permitted to review \\"The Kite Runner\\" a second time, but I have read it for the second time recently, and wanted to say I not only loved it but am looking forward to the December release of the movie with great anticipation and hope.    Unlike \\"The Kite Runner,\\" Hosseini's second novel is written in third person, alternating between the perceptions of Mariam (Rasheed's adolescent wife, who he married after he lost his first wife and son) and Laila (who he tricks into marrying him twenty years later when he is 60 and she is only 14 and recently orphaned).     I recommend both of Hosseini's novels.  He has demonstated clearly his exceptional writing and storytelling skills, and taught us some things about Afghanistan's political struggles that many of us wish were not true.  His characters are vividly created and larger than life.  His villains are so real, you wish you could strangle them or shoot them yourself.  Mariam and Laila are both heroines, each in her own way.    This book is full of heart-wrenching emotion.  We vicariously feel its characters' joy, elation, terror, romantic passion, despair, grief, and ultimately hope for a better future.  Enabling us to do this is what Khaled Hosseini does best.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|To say that the second season of Veronica Mars was incredible would be an understatement. Who would've thought that the first season's two main mysteries would--or could--be topped.

Not to mention the \\"leave 'em hanging\\" moments we were left with.<br /><br />Enter season three.<br /><br />Veronica and the gang are all in college. Ironically enough, the same college as well. BUT! With the (unmissed) absence of Duncan, we get two new characters, and one that's genuinely cool! First, we have Piz. Piz is Wallace's new roommate. He's your music loving, Veronica crushing, radio DJ. Then we have Mac's new roommate, Parker. Without delving too far into her character, things happen with her and she actually turns out to be a nice little addition to our circle.<br /><br />My main beef with the third season of Veronica Mars is that it's lacking the season-long mysteries that the first two had. You could easily start watching any episode you wanted and you wouldn't be that lost for very long. Whereas if you were to do that with the previous seasons, you would be lost. I will give its due though, the few mysteries that do last for a while are enormously entertaining, just not as hard to figure out as before.<br /><br />The main mysteries?<br />1. Serial rapes.<br />2. A murder.<br /><br />Special mention to the season finale. I loved it, it was funny, engrossing, all the things that make every Veronica Mars finale great. With it being cancelled though, there's some questions left up in the air. I was expecting a more final ending than what was given.<br /><br />As for the special features, they're iffy. The season four preview was interesting, although I find myself a bit glad they didn't make it. The thing that kind of sucks is that the special features basically revolve around the creator, Rob Thomas. There's no feature that has the cast talking about the show, their reaction to the show being cancelled, etc. Aside from the season four preview, the only other feature worth watching is the gag reel.<br /><br />As negative as my review my come across, I still love Veronica Mars immensely. The witty dialogue we all love is still ever apparent, Veronica's relationships remain interesting, the moments that make your jaw drop are still here, and the mysteries are still good. You can't complain to those facts at all. Plus, Paul Rudd's hilarious guest spot is worth seeing alone. Overall, the third season is a great one and I'm sure every Veronica Mars fan is sure to agree.etc. Aside from the season four preview, the only other feature worth watching is the gag reel.

0399134204|2.0|My first Amy Tan book and probably my last. Joy Luck Club is mostly fluff. This book offers little to the reader.    Writing style is not particularly good.  No interesting insights into Chinese Americans.   Nothing educational about China, the old country.  Not particaularly well researched.    There are lots of better books to read if you are interested in any of the above areas. Ha Jin, a Chinese American is an outstanding writer. You will learn a lot about China and be entertained. \\"Wild Swans\\" is an very educational non-fiction that reads like fiction. I recommend skipping this one and going for the better quality books.
B000O178BY|4.0|Nine Inch Nails is one of those bands that will never really be able to live up to the massive success of their breakthrough album.  \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was such an influential, massively successful album that nothing Trent Reznor ever does will be able to top it, but everything he does will be constantly compared to it.  This might not matter so much if Trent Reznor was not the musical genius he is.  If he was content to sit back and make a living by imitating the sound of \\"Spiral\\", it would only be fair that he would never top it.  But that's not the kind of musician he is.  He's going to experiment and grow and always mature as an artist, and nothing pisses off music fans like their favorite bands doing new things.  I mean, just look at Metallica.    The followup to \\"Spiral\\" was \\"The Fragile\\", which was a boring, laborious double album that really shouldn't have been.  It had a few good songs, such as the title track, but for the most part it was self-indulgent, repetitive, and just plain dull.  After that came \\"With Teeth\\", which was short, catchy, and for the most part, radio-friendly.  I have no problem with that album, but it was bit lame for Nine Inch Nails.  It seemed that good old Trent has had problems coming up with a record to even compare to his masterpiece.    The new album \\"Year Zero\\" is not that album either, but for the record, it is better than both \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Teeth\\".  What really amazed me was that he made a new album so fast.  There was a five year wait between Spiral and Fragile, and then a six year wait until Teeth, which only came out two years ago.  Maybe he should focus on making albums faster in the future.    \\"Year Zero\\" is definitely NIN's best album since \\"Spiral\\".  It is more biting and relevant than \\"Teeth\\", and much more focused and straightforward than the rambling \\"Fragile\\".  It has more of a techno sound that is reminiscent of \\"Spiral\\", and is not as deliberately radio friendly as \\"Teeth\\".  I'm sorry to define the album by comparing it to the others, but I think that's the most efficient way.    There are several great songs, such as \\"Survivalism\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Capital G.\\"  Making fun of the Bush Administration is pretty easy these days, but the song is still good.  The album is actually a sort of concept album, imagining what our lives might be like in the future.  The environment, politics, war, religion, and the media are all put on display.  And none of them get away without some serious criticism.  Perhaps this focus is what makes the album so good.  Each song has something very important to say.  Some of the lyrics are absolutely brilliant.    From \\"Capital G\\":  \\"I pushed a button and elected him to office / and he pushed a button and it dropped the bomb.\\"  Also, \\"Don't try and tell me how some power can corrupt a person / You haven't had enough to know what it's like.\\"  The song is basically a slam against Bush and the general Republican mindset.    From \\"The Warning,\\" from the point of view of an alien race:  \\"We have come to intervene / You will change your ways and you will make amends / Or we will wipe this place clean.\\"    From \\"God Given\\":  \\"I sure wouldn't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood.\\"  Obviously, this song is against religious fundamentalists.    One similarity this album does share with \\"Teeth\\" is the sing-songy nature of the lyrics.  Many of the choruses have a very catchy rhythym, which I don't mind if they're saying something interesting.  But the music is more complex and more inspired in general.    Like I said before, Trent Reznor is never going to top \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  But even with that in mind, \\"Year Zero\\" is his best album since then and totally worth buying.  Actually, it's worth buying just for the USBM Warning on the back.  That was just awesome.
0394573439|3.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this novel, and with such a reputation I looked forward to reading it. However, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed after I finished. I agree that the prose itself is excellent, but as a whole the book just didn't work for me. There were individual sections I enjoyed, but overall it was, well, boring. There was little or no plot to drive it, and the character of Stevens got a bit too repetitive for me towards the end. Despite the book's many fans, this was one book that simply didn't do it for me

B000I2J0W4|5.0|This movie here finally gets the transfer, correct aspect ratio and oodles of extras it deserves!  This movie was previously only available in \\"open-matte\\" 4x3, as all of Stanley Kubrick's pre-and post-2001-A Space Odyssey gems, per Stanley's wish.  But the movie was originally shown in 1.85:1 top-to-bottom masked (which is almost identical to HDTVs' 16x9 shape) in cinemas, and I'm sure Stanley himself would agree that, in the HD era, this is how his films should be shown.  Not only do we get more resolution from the frame-filling widescreen image, but the more-than-double-the-resolution of 1080p HD renders this film in as close to a 35mm presentation as it's ever been.  The extreme wide-angle lense compositions, particularly inside the hedge-maze, are now properly-framed, as we are drawn into the world of madness and homicide that Nicholson's Jack Torrence character descends into, along with his family, his wife Wendy, hysterics properly protrayed by Shelly Duvall, and his son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd, who possesses the psychic \\"gift\\" of The Shining, where he can see the future and the horrific past of the Overlook Hotel and its demons.  The soundtrack receives a robust discreet 5.1 surround remix, rendering the spine-tingling Bartok and Wendy Carlos music with ever-greater detail that cuts to the bone, as well as various roaring '20s artists, in spectacular stereo with rear detail.  This remains the quintessential Stanley Kubrick classic, visually immaculate, with a story as twisted and disturbing as only Stanley (with the help of author Stephen King here) could muster.  Don't watch this one alone!

An awesome, awesome TV show if you like Sci-Fi with a Western mix!  There's nothing else like it.

B000005DQR|5.0|HAHAHA!<br /><br />Sorry, but I couldn't resist.<br /><br />Yeah, I tend to go for Tobin's twisted landscapes, but nobody can do beauty, peacefullness, and beautiful bliss like Shadow.  This album is a landmark, and one of the quintessential albums of electronic music.  Of course, there are so many great albums, and that says quite a bit.  Even with today's superior electronics and, uh, Tobin (last time I compare him to Shadow), it still hasn't aged.  Of course, I wasn't aware of this album until last summer, but it sounds fresh as a spring morning. He is the master at beautiful collages, and if electronic music has soul, than  Shadow is the soul keeper (Lame, I know), the gatekeeper of beauty.<br /><br />Warm like a blanket, dark as night, cold and chilly, blissfull peace, there are so many moods.  There isn't any real tension in this album, as it doesn't have to.  Midnight In A Perfect World is perfect for the urban  bliss.  Stem/Long Stem is a stark, lonely, dark, myserious, with a hint of light.  Building Steam with A Grain Of Salt?  Rain, mesmerizing.  What Does Your Soul Look Like explore that your soul is multifaced.  It will truly conjure up something, maybe even exactly what you soul look likes (there are more of Soul Look Like songs on [[ASIN:B000005DQU Preemptive Strike]]).  There's even some breaks, such as the untitled track, the more uptempo The Number Song (which is better than I once thought, for sure), and the best one yet, Why Hip Hop Sucks in 96', a great stab at the lame rap music at the time (I can't imagine what Why Hip Hop sucks in 08' sounds like).<br /><br />Shadow will prove to you that he is an artist.  Too many ________ electronic \\"artists\\" let everything do the work for them, set their machines on overdrive, and operate it like it a machine.  One little change, it's soul less, thoughtless, robotic.  Shadow takes samples, melds,  cuts, pastes, he's brilliant.  He uses tension, he uses his instrument as that, as he adds twists, turns, he's the master at that (certainly nearly on par as a certain Brazillian Born artist).  Besides, he's just pretty much using already recording material and just playing a bunch at the same time, on a ________ turntable and other stuff.  Not much different, if you really think about it.<br /><br />Add my voice to the numerous five star reviews.  It remains a cornerstone that all music lovers should purchase, no questions asked.<br /><br />10/10early on par as a certain Brazillian Born artist).

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears has been my favorite musician sense I was in Jr. High when she dropper her first album, \\"Baby One More Time.\\" I have sense loved every song in not only that first album, but also in \\"Oops I Did It Again,\\" \\"Britney,\\" \\"In The Zone,\\" \\"B in the Mix: The Remixes,\\" (which I was upset that I couldn't copy onto my iPod because of advanced copyright protection encrypted into the disc) \\"My Prerogative: Greatest Hits,\\" (which included many remixes to great songs and also comes in DVD which include not only all of the videos for the whole album, but also the non-remixed videos) and now \\"Blackout.\\"    There is definitely something special about Britney Spears. I have extremely particular taste in music. The single only other artist who I love every song produced by is Marilyn Manson. Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson are the only artists in which I will purchase an album on the day they are released, having not heard anything featured on the album. Other than those two, I only know of about ten other albums (each from a separate artist, to include \\"And Justice For All\\" - Metallica; \\"Issues\\" - Korn; \\"The Great Escape\\" - Gwen Stafani...) that I would care to listen to from front to back, not wanting to miss one second.    This album contains a very important element that I look for in music. I don't listen to music, I experience it. I look for something that has a hint of darkness in the feeling it provides you while you listen, a smoothness in the sound, among other things, and this album definitely has everything I look for. Blackout is an experience in which, now that I have had, I know I wouldn't want to live without; just like the rest of Britney's albums.    The darkness in the bass lines throughout this album is perfectly blended with the sexiness, and a soothing smooth-feeling variety of perfectly paired tones that flow from the talented vocals of Britney Spears.    This album will most likely grow to become my favorite album so far, and I continue, as always, to look forward to any and all albums that will be released by Britney Spears in the future.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears has had much attention from the press and media recently due to her emotional breakdown, divorce, and loss of custody of her two young children.  Amidst all her troubles, she does manage to do one thing that's productive in her life: release \\"Blackout\\".  \\"Blackout\\" is by far her best album yet (I'd even rather listen to it than her Greatest Hits album) and the pop princess proves that even though she's going through a rough time, she can still manage to put all that aside and release an album that shows us that we haven't quite lost her yet.  Every song on this album is catchy and the lyrics are not nearly as childish as on her previous albums.  I have been a long-time Britney fan, right from the beginning, and even I had no hope for this CD.  I just didn't think that she could still pull off an album such as this and this was going to be her own personal fight to retain popularity and fame during such a hard time in her life.  However, she proves me wrong.  I think that this CD is the perfect one to bring along in the car because it makes for a very enjoyable ride.  Nearly everybody has heard the song \\"Gimme More,\\" but there is so much else that this album has to offer.  Oh, and I'm sure that everyone saw Britney's comeback on the VMAs with her live performance flop of \\"Gimme More,\\" but trust me, she may have bombed the VMAs and been the topic of yet more conversations, but she really pulls it out here and deserves some praise.    Best songs on the album:  Break the Ice  Gimme More  Ooh Ooh Baby  Hot as Ice    Hey, four flawless songs on one album is definitely worth a buy, so do yourself a favor and buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.    ***** Way to go, Britney!

B000W4HFY8|5.0|It's been six years since I heard this incredible soundtrack mangled on the VHS release of the series, and even then I could detect its alternately innocent and dark gorgeousness shining through the horrendously warbly audio track.  A decade and a half after Twin Peaks ended, six long years since I finished watching the show, and here we are.  This is music that I have quite simply been yearning for for years.  There is something about Twin Peaks that has created a condensed kind of nostalgia for series itself, the time in my life during which I watched it, and the people I watched it with, as well as something more, an unplaceable, deep and vivid longing for something that does not quite exist.  Twin Peaks: Season Two Music has landed softly into my current life, not unlike a telegram from my six-years-ago self, and even with such magnificent tracks like Shelly, Audrey's Prayer, Harold's Theme, Josie and Truman, Hook Rug Dance, and Half Heart, I'm left with the sense of an intangible absence, one I suspect will never be filled after living ever so briefly in the staggeringly multidimensional world of Twin Peaks.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Beautiful music sung by the most talented lyricist of today. Fits the movie perfectly and really helps tell the story well.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I want to start by saying that this album is quite solid. There is a certain flow to all of the songs that makes them sound as though they should all be on the same album. That was not so with \\"City of Evil.\\" Now, I will agree with the majority and say that \\"Waken the Fallen\\" was a better album, but I'm not going to compare that album to this one. I don't think there is even a comparison! A band grows and a band changes, that's the way it has always worked. Look at any other band out there!<br /><br />The upside:<br /><br />-The songs on this album have a simple structure and are highly accessible to pretty much all audiences. When you listen to this album you are guaranteed, at least, to have a good time (and even a few laughs).<br />-The hooks on nearly all of the songs are so awesome that they will give the listener goosebumps or at least have them bobbing their heads.<br />-As for the musicianship, it is quite good! It's better than any standard set by other artists today. Also, it's unique and definitely stands out through all the BS metal music coming around.<br />-Finally, the experimentation is a wonderful step forward! Songs like \\"A little piece of Heaven\\" intrigue me into where this band will be going in the future!<br /><br />The downside:<br /><br />-The guitar solos are lacking in this album. The majority of them are weak and add nothing to the music but a little background noise.<br />-The album only has ten songs. That's nearly an EP! I was hoping for at least twelve songs.<br />-Finally, the lyrics are kind of tacky at times. They've never been brilliant but on this album, they are really quite blatant and lack poetry throughout.<br /><br />So, in conclusion:<br /><br />This is a solid release from a solid band. If you go into this album looking to have a good time and hear some amazing songs, you will not be disappointed. This is one of those albums that you simply have to listen to. Don't analyze it, don't dissect it, just listen to it!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is great, I've been a fan from the beginning and with this album Britney just rocks my world. Buy the album you will not be disappointed!
0307277887|2.0|Jeff Lindsay writes well. He's fun to read.  Unfortunately, his plot development doesn't stand up to his writing abilities.  Anyone can pull a rabbit out of a hat to solve a mystery which is exactly what Lindsay does here.  He solves the mystery by introducing a new character with just pages to go.  I felt cheated and disappointed.  Perhaps his other books are better, but I doubt I'll take the time to find out.  P.S. Is there really such a thing as a blood splatter expert?

B000V6BE6C|3.0|I am a big fan of both City of Evil and Waking the Fallen.  I like Sounding the Seventh Trumpet a lot, as well.  All of these CDs are completely different from each other, so I knew not to expect anything and just wait and see....    So, my first impression of the new self-titled CD was \\"this isn't very good.\\"  I was completely disappointed at first because, while this album may have more pop influence, the songs aren't as catchy or memorable as City or Waking.  Furthermore, in stark contrast to the previous two CDs, there are definitely a couple tracks I could do without.  So, first impression, I was thinking 2, maybe 2.5 stars.    Having given the CD a few more listens (and watching the Making Of... DVD that comes with the Spec. Ed., I started to appreciate it a bit more.  While some of the songs incorporate a bit of the feel of City or Waking, for the most part the CD is a departure for A7X that incorporates a lot more of a pop feel, more electronic effects and more musicians with horns and string arrangements for many of the songs, as well as back-up vocalists and choral arrangements.  Furthermore, two of the tracks have a very country vibe.  Sometimes this stuff works and sometimes it doesn't.  They've also slowed down quite a bit, with a few exceptions, from the City vibe, giving this CD more of a groove-oriented feel.    I like to end on a high note, so I'll talk about the bad first.  As I said, two of the songs feature heavy country influence (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, per se).  One of them, Gunslinger, is one of the songs I alluded to that I could do without.  It's not horrible, but it's nothing special, either.  To me, a real filler track that either could have been left out entirely or, at the very least, could have used the outside opinion of a producer to give the sing a little more.....I don't know.....just something a little more.  Actually, the whole CD could have benefited from an outside producer.  I give A7X props for self-producing....it's not an easy job.  But a producer giving that little extra push by saying, \\"that wasn't bad, but try it one more time to see if you can do a little better\\" would have helped, I think.    The other track I REALLY could do without is A Little Piece of Heaven.  This is the biggest departure of all for A7X.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, either, but in this instance, it just doesn't work for me.  This song is pretty much a showtune with a bit of a heavy music influence.  The general feel of the song and the horn arrangement is just corny...almost slapstick humor, which is very possibly what they were going for, but it does nothing for me.  It's long, repetitive and totally out of place.  Again, I give them props for trying something different, but this, the longest track on the CD, is 8 minutes I could just do without.    The other thing about this CD that I think could have been better is the lyrics.  Some are pretty tacky (as others have pointed out) or just plain uninteresting.  Not that Shadows and Co. have ever been the greatest lyricists, but the previous CDs' lyrics had more subtlety to them.  The lyrics on much of this record are just generic and unimaginative.    Okay, now to the good.  The drumming and guitar work, A7X trademarks, is very good on many of the tracks.  The standout tracks for me are Scream (perhaps the song that most blends a little of the Waking feel & a little of the City feel with the more poppy direction of the CD), Afterlife (one of the better uses of strings and choir on the CD), and my favorite track, Lost (probably the most City-like track on the album) with its (as Gates said) \\"uber-melodic\\" fast guitar solos and catchy chorus (the effect on the vocals didn't really bother me).  I also think Lost has some of the better lyrics the CD has to offer and previously-mentioned guitar solo is my favorite on the CD.  Unbound (The Wild Ride) is another fast, melodic track that is reminiscent of City at times.  As for the good departuresfrom the typical A7X sound (whatever that is), those tracks would be Brompton Cocktail (very cool, dark horn arrangement that complements the band and Shadows very well) and Dear God (the other country-ish tune).  Dear God closes the CD and while it is a slow song heavy on the country and pop influence, I rather enjoy it and think it's a step forward from Seize the Day, as far as slow songs go.    All in all, it's really not a bad CD.  I give it 3.5 stars (whereas I would give 4.5 to both Waking and City).  If you don't like it at first, give it a couple more listens before you decide whether you love it, like it or hate it.  As I said, it didn't do much for me on first listen, but it's kind of grown on me like a fungus after listening to it a few more times.  If you were expecting another City or Waking, then you haven't been paying attention to A7X for very long.  If, on the other hand, you've been following them for a little while or are familiar with their first 3 CDs, then you knew to not have any expectations as far as sound and style goes.  If you did, then you were just trying to fool yourself.  Personally, with this in mind, I'm just happy they got A Little Piece of Heaven out of the way so that now they (hopefully) don't feel the need to do that again!  I feel bad saying it because it is obvious, having watched the Making of, that they are very proud of this song and The Rev and Co. worked hard on writing and arranging it, but I hate this song.

1932100660|4.0|This book contains life-saving insights into what should be the everyday concerns of each one of us. To many it will make uncomfortable reading, because it addresses a number of home truths which, in order to make any significant difference, require the reader to respond by changing his lifestyle and eating habits drastically.    It is a welcome confirmation of information known in outline from other sources, and it gives a wealth of educational details about food and drink and their effect on our bodies. All those with questions about why the present generation has such problems with obesity and the concomitant lifestyle diseases that accompany modern living compared with the relative simplicity of the past and its accompanying dearth of horrible diseases needs to read this book and take its message to heart. It is regrettable that not many will even care to consider its life-saving contents.

B000V6BE6C|5.0|I've been an A7X fan since day one. Being a resident of Huntingon Beach myself led me to catching a ton of their local shows. They've always had a raw energy and a great stage presence.    This new release is a solid release for the group AND for hard rock in general. The key to the success of this album is the sheer VARIETY of it. Both \\"Waking The Fallen\\" and \\"City of Evil\\" were great albums but I had the feeling that they were almost too predictable. Every song worked well and was placed appropriately on those albums but it just lacked the experimentation that the self titled release does.    Songs reminiscent of Waking The Fallen such as \\"Critical Acclaim\\" and \\"Almost Easy\\" show that the group haven't lost their ability to tear a set of speakers to shreds with their heavyness. The tracks that stand apart are the ones that have Avenged moving in new directions, such as the epic and pleading \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" (Shadows' strongest vocal performance on the album) and the Danny Elfman orchestrated mini opera \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\". (Sidenote: this song was penned by Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan. For more of his tunes, be sure to purchase his side project, Pinkly Smooth's, album 'Unfortunate Snort' on CDBaby.) Kudos also to The Rev for throwing in some vocals. He's got a great, biting voice.    Overall, the songs are all well-written, epic, rocking, and everything you'd expect from Avenged Sevenfold. I will admit it's NOT \\"Waking The Fallen\\" but if you wanted them to put out the same cd again, there'd be no point for them to write new music, y'know? Pick it up and give it a spin. It's worth the time, I promise!
B000002G7E|5.0|As a Velvet Underground/Lou Reed fan from the foggy sixties, I was very pleased to find this \\"album\\" still available. It is a perfect example of the raw, edgy, unsophisticated & repetitious rock that drew such a loyal base. I attended a VU concert in a small, popular venue that packed us in shoulder to shoulder. VU came out, played out of key, out of tune and seemingly totally stoned, for a very short set. About a third of the audience left disgusted, leaving room, and comfort, for the remaining devotees. Reed came back on stage, scanned the remaining audience, and proceeded to apologize for the bad performance - then said, 'we saw how packed and uncomfortable it was, and played crappy on purpose to make room for our true fans'. They proceeded to play a super long, incredibly tight set, that blew us all away. Superb!
0930289528|5.0|This is the one book that made me rethink my stance on the role of comics in literature. Beautifully rendered artwork combined with an inspired story makes for a real attention-grabber. I'd recommend this book to just about anyone with a brain.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I was at Wal-Mart waiting while I had my tires rotated when I gave in and bought this album. Being an Eagles fan I thought it was my duty. I must admit I almost missed it on the shelf. The CD cover looked like one of those low budget relaxation CDs or a tribute albums with Eagles songs played by an all mandolin orchestra or something silly like that.    Anyway, I put in disc one and nearly fell asleep during the first track. Then I was woken up by a modern country/bluesy/indescript song that I understand is the first single. Yikes, they were really out of ideas! \\"How Long\\" encompasses everything I find lacking in modern country music. The melody is ordinary, it has that commonplace rockin' bluesy feel and it's boring. Did I mention how boring it was? Where's the invention here? Where's the creativity? Why do old men like that rockin' blues thing so much?  Are these really the same guys who wrote all that great music in the 70s?  Really?    It's not all bad. Most of the good songs are nice. That's the only way I can say it, they're nice. Nothing is so creative it will alienate the average listener and everything has a certain blandness about it. Still, there are some nice songs here. I did load about an album's worth of nice songs on my iPod. The rest will probably never be played by me again.
B000UK73QO|5.0|The book as well as the CD are a call for respect and preservation as well as love for all forms of life in the planet. Highly recommended

B000RC2EH8|4.0|This is by far the best Turtle movie made. The animation was excellent. What was most important was that they were able to stay true to the seiours original comic book story line and still maintain some of the fun/kiddie stuff from the 80s cartoon that many of us grew up on. The problem with the past movies is they were just too... cheesy, for lack of a better word. This movie delivered good action, some funny comedy, and it was easier to get drawn into the story. Definitely a good addition if you are a fan of TMNT.
0790729407|4.0|Shows how hard the irish struggle was and how brutal the Brits could be.  They should have left Julia Roberts out of the story line though.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is a must-have! I've always loved Britney, her music, her status and her persona deeply and I must say that each album surprises me a lot and so far I've really enjoyed all of them. But this one is absolutely mind-blowing! Highly inspired, wonderfully arranged, amazingly produced, each track is absolutely beautiful, edgy and innovative. It's clear that, along with her producers, she worked really hard to get a final sound that is chiseled and vocals that are perfect. And the lyrics are not just fun-filled. Some of them are quite deep and introspective. It's hard for me to say which are my favorite songs, because I like them all, but if I really had to choose, I'd signal \\"Piece Of Me\\", \\"Heaven On Earth\\" and \\"Get Naked (I Got A Plan)\\". I think that it will win over even her harshest critics. Simply her best record ever and undoubtedly the best album of the year!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Gotta love it!!!!  He's got the inspiration of the early days, classic BRUCE.   One track is better than the other, with Brilliance, Brucie!!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I found the interpretation of \\"Extreme Ways\\" at the end of the movie far inferior to the original Moby version sang in the two other movies..... and that's about the only remotely negative thing I can say about this movie which action, from what I was able to understand, occurs between the Moscow and New York sections of SUPREMACY.   I loved the way previous sequences got me guessing incorrectly about the final fate of a couple of characters (Nicki and the reporter). The characters' actions in this movie are true to their nature as shown on the two previous films and that's just very rare with sequels these days. The incredible chase at the Waterloo station is as good as the one in Tangiers, as the ones in Madrid and New York, and so on.   I don't question the film makers ability to come up with a fourth movie but frankly ULTIMATUM ties up everything so nicely that I would much rather they leave them at three. If they do (which I sincerely doubt) the Bourne trilogy will always be remembered as one of the best action series in film history.
B00005JPS5|1.0|If you're looking for an animated movie that's smart and that will appeal to adults as well as children, stay away from Bee Movie. I was invited to a screening and the predominant reaction in the audience to the profoundly predictable plot and very lame jokes was silence. Very eloquent silence.    I guess Jerry Seinfeld needs Larry David in order to be funny, but fans of the sitcom about nothing will be sorely disappointed. I just hope Renee Zellweger got paid lots of money for her participation in Bee Movie. Otherwise, what's the point of her selling out?
B000FA57N0|5.0|I would have to say that even though I do not care for the cover this is the best looking hd dvd that I own.  The graphics are great and the sound is supurb.  I really hope that one day (not too far off) they will bring back the series.
B000UCEJEQ|1.0|This album conjures up some overwrought moments.  To boot, her voice is starting to travel somewhere very strange.  What used to be magical and emotional has turned into caterwauling.  The title is overstated and promises way more than what is delivered.  I ADORE Annie Lennox, so this is extremely hard for me to swallow.
B000OONTFU|4.0|I was a little disappointed not so much because of the graphics not being up to par but because they did not fix the cg especially in reloaded.  The movies are still as good as ever it is just that in reloaded you have a lot of outdated cg and it shows but I believe that it would do this with either hd or bluray.  Part three is the best looking out of the three and has less cg or it is just more up to date and harder to follow.  Over all I would probably not get this as a whole set if you already own it but if you do not it is worth the money if you are going to purchase it for the first time.
0307010856|5.0|My MIL recently gave us a few books from my husband's childhood and this book was among them. My daughter is 3 and absolutely LOVES it! She giggles throughout the whole thing and loves it when Mommy and Daddy do their \\"Grover\\" voice. We've just had it since last week and she already has in memorized and likes to \\"read\\" it to us. I'm actually considering obtaining another copy just in case something happens to this one! LOL!     I HIGHLY recommend it. It's short and sweet and your kids will love it! :)
B000MX7V5M|4.0|With Hitchcock directing Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, you already know it's going to be a stylish and suspenseful story. The short form of that story is that Grant is a reformed (so he says) jewel thief, out of prison on sufferance, and thefts start to happen with exact matches to his trademark modus operandi. Kelly shows up as a moneyed debutante and dilettante, someone who seems to think he's an attraction, like a carnival ride, placed for her amusement. If she can just find where to put a quarter in the slot, he'll put on his amusing show for her. Then the ride stops being fun when it's her suite that's robbed.<br /><br />Grant, Kelly, and Hitchcock (including his famous cameo, out of the way early so people will just watch the movie) make this a classic. So does the time in which the movie was made - the current day, for its initial audience, with WWII still fresh in memory. That acts as a backdrop for some of the tension. Part of it takes place in a bistro where the staff's backgrounds are as checkered as the tablecloths, but their shady pasts (like Grant's) are forgivable because they were heroes in the French resistance. When Grant's supposed relapse into crime threatens their paroles, it adds one more force to the dramatic convergence.<br /><br />Other points identify this movie as a product of its time, including the effects-free chase across rooftops and mostly-believable athletic feats. Anyone accustomed to MI3 standards will find it comical or somnolent. Still the style is true to its time, and a lot more true to what un-wired people could credibly do.<br /><br />It's a good movie from another age - but it really is of another age. Modern viewers will see it as retro or nostalgic, when it was meant to be immediate and thrilling. But mostly, it's still a good movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000Y179KO|5.0|Any Eagles fan will love this!  The only real negative, in my opinion, is that the title song, found on disk 2, is too long at 10+ minutes.  If it were a fast-beat song it wouldn't matter but it has a slower beat that really seems to make the song drag.  Overall, though, you can't beat it.  Can't wait for the tour!
185984054X|4.0|As always, Hitchens shows us who´s the boss. And he´s doing us all a favour - in a world where everybody just seems to adore and almost worship this little misguided Albanian woman. Teresa is a worldclass hypocrite and scam artist. Do yourself a favour and read this little book -
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In the Zone is Brit's best album to date. It's not as poppish as her previous three albums. With this album Britney takes some chances. She experiments with different sounds and she shows tremendous growth as an artist. Tracks like \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Early Mornin\\" are very chill, laid back songs that you can just relax to, while \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"The Hook Up\\" are raggae dance numbers that are sure to get you on your feet. Brit experiments with techno on the infamous \\"Toxic\\". \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow\\" are beautiful ballads where Britney really showcases her voice. Brit's lyrics have also matured. This is evident in the controversial track \\"Touch of my Hand\\". This is such a fantastic album. It really shows how much our teeny bopper Brit has matured musically AND lyrically. The only reason I'm giving this album 4 stars and not 5 is because I would've liked the album to be a few tracks longer and they could've done without a remix of \\"Me Against the Music\\" (which is one of the weaker tracks on the album). Anyhow, this is a great record. Even those non-Britney fans will enjoy several tracks. Highly recommended.
B00005JNEI|2.0|There is no difference between Ann Coulter and Michael Moore. They both spew irrational nonsense aimed directly at your heart while swiftly avoiding your brain. Movies of this nature are designed to incite rage and anger amongst those viewing it who agree, and those who disagree with the thoughts within. I am enraged for a different reason.    I have never had a logical discussion about politics with anyone who thoroughly believes in films like this (or books like Ann Coulter's). Viewers and readers are all mindless sheep, and if they aren't, they sure are treated like them. This is politics, WWE style. I am not a Republican or a Democrat; I am not a conservative or a liberal. I have my own beliefs and I refuse to align myself with either side because of radicals such as these.  The only reason I am giving this movie 2 stars is because it at least acknowledges that we shouldn't mindlessly give into everything we're told about the way the country is run.  However, this is still propaganda garbage that I can't see any difference between it and watching The O'Reilly Factor.    Dismantle the two party system, we are not a free country.
0316067598|1.0|I really wanted to love this book...really!   I'm not going to drone on and repeat what others here have so correctly observed.  I'm just writing a quick observation.  I heard Mr. Luttrell on NPR being interviewed by Terri Gross.  Having a brother in Iraq for his second tour perhaps made me a little hypersensitive, but I cried when he spoke.  I even cried again when I toldmy wife his story.  He sounded so humble and so professional, answering questions with , \\"yes ma'am, no ma'am.\\"   A true gentleman.  I figured I owed him and his fallen comrades at least the price of the book to thank them for the price they've paid for all Americans.  I started to read the book and was a little taken back by his abject hatred for liberals and the liberal media and the blame he places on them for not letting him do his job.  I even told my wife I wasn't thrilled with those passages, but that was his opinion and I'm sure it was just background- it wouldn't carry throughout the book I was sure.  Boy was I wrong!  This guy is a total blowhard!  I admire what he's accomplished to get where he is and have nothing but respect for his counterparts.  As part of a military family, I know the sacrifice.  But come on... to blame poor planning, poor decision making, and poor execution of your mission on the liberal media is just too far of a stretch.  I'm at chapter 6 and I refuse to read anymore unless someone can tell me that the tone of the book changes and he has an epiphany and realizes that liberals are kind of OK people too. Guessing that's not going to happen!   He's totally entitled to his opinion, but he wears the flag of the United States on his uniform, not the flag of Just The Red States.  I enjoyed the backstory, the Hell Week first hand account and I understood the bravado and macho- these guys are trained to be that way because the mental weapon is the most powerful.  I enjoyed the objective parts of the book, but the subjective is just so preposterous that I'm not wasting anymore of my time.  Thanks for reading my review.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This is a great show with very funny moments. The characters are the kind of people you wish you could hang out with every day. Neil Patrick Harris is fantastic, such a funny character. Swarles Barkley Rules. Check it out and SUIT UP!
0743486285|5.0|Nikkis story has been somewhat discussed in \\"The Dirt\\" but this book expands greatly on his story. It's pretty much what you might expect and maybe a little of what you might not.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I'm a long-time Eagles fan...although I discovered them a bit too late.  I got into them JUST as they broke up after their Long Run promotional tour circa late 1980 or early '81.  My goal (briefly anyway) was to see them in concert and as I mentioned that to my oldest sister she comically joked \\"That'll be a bit difficult...\\" not realizing at that point they were (at the time) finished with each other, and Hell would freeze over before they could ever see themselves recording together again.  Thankfully they got the Ski Run's up in the netherworld because Hell Freezes Over was simply amazing.<br /><br />My dream to see them live finally materialized in 2000 (still ranking as THE single greatest concert I have ever attended) and the 6 years they took to produce this record seemed intolerable at the very least.  They slowly teased us with 'Hole In The World', 'No More Cloudy Days' amongst a few others and it always seemed as though their first full studio album in 28 years was '...just around the corner.'  I bought my copy at Walmart the day it went on sale on my way to work at 5 in the morning.  Yeah, I REALLY wanted this disc.<br /><br />So was the wait worth it??  That is a bit more complicated to answer however.  I recall back when the Beatles released those two new songs based on minor recordings left behind by John Lennon on the Anthology CD's and I remember how disappointed I was after hearing them.  However after being exposed to them for a while, I discovered something interesting: I really began to appreciate them.  The same goes for 'Long Road Out Of Eden'.  Some of the songs have instant appeal...and some grow on you over time, and become--after a few spins--VERY likeable.<br /><br />I've been in radio for nearly 20 years, and I have seen it happen time and again: famous groups get back together and produce a new studio album that invariably sucks -- yet sells by the millions.  Fleetwood Mac is but one example.  I was terrified that my Eagles would make the same mistake.  Could they make magic again after all these years?  Were they tapped out creatively?  Do they even SOUND good after all this time?  Again, the answer may be as different for you as it is for me, but I have to say that I was absolutely satisfied with what I got for my $11.88 at Walmart.<br /><br />Disc 1 is MUCH better than Disc 2 -- again, MY opinion here.  The long and epic title track is simply amazing and I was unbelievably thrilled to hear that the vocals of Glenn, Don, Timothy and Joe are still as pristine as you could ever hope them to be.  Many of the tracks harken back to the bands origin with that classic 'Country/Rock' combination that made such classics as, 'Lyin' Eyes' sound so great, and yet they inject fantastic R&B rhythm into more than a few songs.  Don't worry, Joe Walsh has brought some of his rockin' style to the plate, too, and the smooth and high vocals of Timothy is just incredible, and VERY welcome here.<br /><br />For those who prayed and literally expected two CD's worth of future Hotel California's here will be obviously disappointed.  However, if you make allowances for the years in between as well as personal growth, and listen to the songs for the simple melodies that they are, you are certainly going to find hours and hours worth of music to savor.  I have discovered that as I have become older, I appreciate music for much different reasons than I did (for the most part anyway) when I was younger.  I have a rather large taste in musical styles (from Van Halen and James Taylor to Alabama) and yet I sometimes OVER-analyze music way too much.  The bottom line is this: The Eagles STILL have it (IMO) but for those who expect 20 songs that are as instantly appealing as some of their classics may just be a little upset.  Face it, these boys have a LOT to live up to.  Their Greatest Hits Vol 1 has now surpassed Thriller as the biggest selling record of all-time...and it continues to sell thousands of copies every single year.The reason for that is simple: no matter HOW long ago they were recorded, great music will always BE great.  I submit that the Long Road Out Of Eden can stand side-by-side (but for different reasons) with the best music the Eagles have ever produced.  Great stuff by arguably the greatest American Band ever assembled.<br /><br />Take it for what it's worth...and for MY $$, it's worth a LOT.er HOW long ago they were recorded, great music will always BE great.

0143038419|5.0|Forget your money-belt and passport.  Let Elizabeth Gilbert take your hand and your heart on an unforgettable journey.  This is the best book I've read for years.  It's the journey most of us haven't the courage to take but it inspires us to move on, learn, and open ourselves to that which we do not know.  Before you're ten pages in, Elizabeth will be the best friend you never had.  Months after reading it, it still resonates.  It's a book to love.  Light a candle, make some tea and leave your daily grind.  You'll be glad you did.
0807126063|5.0|The funniest book is Edward Abbey's The Fool's Progress.  I have bought and given away at least five copies of each book.      This book is about absurd characters in absurd situatons, staring at each other in disbelief.  It is hilarious.    A Confederacy of Dunces is a book that defines its own genre.    Forget about the author's story.  The book stands on its own.
006085880X|5.0|Compelling from start to finish, this was a book I could not put down.  The story was intriguing and the characters were well developed and realistic, even lesser characters like the defense attorney and his son. Descriptions were so vivid that I could easily picture the scenes in my mind.  I especially enjoyed the trial which was convincingly authentic to me. Although I did wonder why some characters said certain things or made certain choices, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story.

B000AP04L0|5.0|How much we like a movie often depends on how closely we can relate it to our own lives or how far it allows us to escape from our own lives. Office Space is that rare movie that meets both these needs. Everyone who has worked in an office will relate to someone in the movie. This brilliantly low-key and low-budget film manages to mock life as a corporation myrmidon in America in just about every possible way.<br /><br />Have you been downsized? You'll love Office Space for its brilliant take on consultants. Have you lived in Dallas, Texas, the capital city of Generica? You'll love Office Space for its acerbic portrayal of life as an apartment rat. Have you been the pawn of intraoffice political power struggles? You'll love Office Space for the character Milton played by Stephen Root.<br /><br />The only people who won't love Office Space are those with IQs in the sub-100 range and corporate vice presidents. Sorry Lundbergh but I accidentally wiped my butt with the TPS reports.
0805079831|5.0|Klein first distinguished herself with *No Logo* emerging on the crest of the anti-globalization movement. For many of us, her book provided systemic analysis and ammunition to reveal the ways in which corporations inscribed themselves into our very psyches while economically scorching over our lands. Once again, Klein offers a systemic analysis of disaster capitalism, which reveals the \\"mismanagement\\" of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the relief efforts of Hurricane Katrina and Sri Lanka to be part of a larger economic junta launched by the Chicago School back in the 1950s. Unlike most journalists, Klein explores beneath the facts to theorize their relations with one another. She offers one of the most insightful interpretations of Iraq that I have ever read by not only examining the warped policies of neo-liberalism systematically gutting the country and its peoples, but also the collusion of the U.S. commercial news in becoming an echo-chamber for the official line pumped out like raw sewage from the Bush Administration's Disinformation Factory.     I have the sneaking suspicion that most, if not all, of the conservative critiques of the book posted on amazon have been completed by people who have not actually read the book in its entirety; these are the same people who have been trained under the sound-bite stupidities that have become the hallmark of the \\"discipline\\" of economics, which is really nothing other than a dumb-downed version of political science. These lackies of capitalism's masturbatory fantasies are unable to comprehend a thought that persists over more than a paragraph and blasphemies against their professor's yellowed, dog-eared encyclicals to profit. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt of actually reading the entire book, these conservative critics are clearly devoid of understanding reality, since I truly don't see how they can deny that New Orleans is in shambles, Iraq is in ruins, and Russia has long since crumbled. Their inability to link such economic destruction with the international policies of the IMF and World Bank, which even Joseph Stiglitz, senior president of the World Bank itself, had addressed in *Globalization and Its Discontents* (2002), strikes me as either being intentionally obtuse, or revealing a complete lack of intelligence on their part. When they complain about Klein's supposed distortions, I suggest that they visit the countries that have been hammered hardest by IMF and World Bank policies-- Argentina, Chile, Russia, or the Third World ghettos of the USA-- and see how well the locals take their Friedmanite proselytizing about capitalism and freedom.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is the hottest Britney album EVER! Every song is a club hit! Just played this at my Halloween party and everyone was dancing like crazy! I kept having people ask me who it was!

The def club hits are:    Gimme More  Piece Of Me  Radar  Break the Ice  Freakshow  Toy Soldier  Perfect Lover    I always was disinterested with Britney Spears until her \\"In The Zone\\" album. Now I love her raw sexuality and hot beats. Nothing like a hot girl singing about hot 'sex' to a hot beat.     If you want to spend the extra money, buy the ITunes Bonus Track version along with the physical album off of Amazon.com! This is a great album just to own for the sake of great pop music!

0739339796|4.0|Da Vinci was the leader of a clandestine society and that he hid secret codes and messages in his art work. Is this true? In addition to his role in history as a famous painter, scientist and inventor, was he also the keeper of some vast secret to be passed down through the ages? Well, Leonardo was certainly no stranger to the use of codes and encryption. His notes are all written backwards with mirror writing andis unclear exactly why Leonardo did this. It has been suggested that he may have felt that some of his military inventions would be too destructive and powerful if they fell into the wrong hands, therefore he protected his notes by using this reversed writing method. Other scholars point out that this type of encryption was fairly simple to break. One needs only to hold the paper up to a mirror to read it. If Leonardo was using it for security, he probably was only concerned about hiding the contents from a casual observer.
B00008WJBU|4.0|Intacto (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2001)<br /><br />Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (28 Weeks Later...) began his feature film career with Intacto, an intriguing meditation on the nature of luck that wouldn't be out of place on your shelf beside El Laberinto del Fauno. While Fresnadillo stays tied much more rightly to the real world than Guillermo del Toro did in 2006's best film, the sense of wonder that pervades del Toro's masterpiece can be found here in equal amounts.<br /><br />Fresnadillo's script, co-written with Andres Koppel, centers on Federico (Eusebio Poncela), who begins the film in the inner circle of the unnaturally lucky. He is employed as a cooler at a casino, but he works in a different way than most: by touching someone, he is capable of stealing that person's store of luck and adding it to his own. When he finds himself wanting to leave the job, he finds he's not allowed to leave with his stored luck; Samuel (Max von Sydow), the man behind all this, steals Federico's luck before allowing him to leave. Federico develops an obsession for finding others like him, training them, and overthrowing Samuel. To this end, he finds Tomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the lone survivor of a plane crash. Unfortunately, Tomas is a bank robber, so the law, in the form of Sara (Monica Lopez), is after him. Federico introduces Tomas to the world of \\"fluid luck\\", for lack of a better term, and the two of them, with Sara always in pursuit, get closer and closer to Federico's goal and the inevitable meeting with Samuel.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is a gritty, understated film-- it would not be outside the realm of validity to call it an urban fantasy-- Fresnadillo does not limit the scope of his vision to the concrete landscapes around him. This is a remarkably free-feeling film; I can't think of any other way to describe it. (This is depicted, specifically, in the casino, which is in a secluded place in the desert, well away from the rest of civilization.) The relentless realism with which it is filmed combines with the ludicrous premise to create a feeling that anything is possible, and that's what keeps the viewer riveted, even more so than the gloomy cinematography, the finely-tuned performances, or the truly original plot. An excellent piece of work all around. ****s filmed combines with the ludicrous premise to create a feeling that anything is possible, and that's what keeps the viewer riveted, even more so than the gloomy cinematography, the finely-tuned performances, or the truly original plot.

6305428522|4.0|Quiz Show (Robert Redford, 1994)<br /><br />The brilliance of Robert Redford's Quiz Show is related, in retrospect, in the film's opening sequence, where Dick Goodwin (Northern Exposure's Rob Morrow) is considering buying a car. The effect of the scene is completely lost the first time you see the film; go back and watch it again once you've got a handle on everything that goes on. That's why Robert Redford is a fantastic director, and Quiz Show is a fantastic film.<br /><br />Based on the true story of the Twenty-One scandal, Quiz Show opens with Brooklyn geek Herb Stempel (Rounders' John Turturro) as the undisputed king of TV quiz show Twenty-One. The producers of the show are looking for someone to replace him, since the ratings are starting to get stale, and they happen upon Charles van Doren (Ralph Fiennes, recently seen in the Harry Potter movies), literature professor from the bluest blood to be found west of the Atlantic. As van Doren is being prepped for the show, Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria), one of its producers, casually asks how he'd feel about them asking him questions they're aware he already knows the answers to. From there, the movie degenerates into a morass of corruption and conscience unequaled in fiction; like the man said, you just can't make this stuff up.<br /><br />The movie was pretty much destined for success. Redford was already well-known as an excellent director. Scriptwriter and (uncredited) producer Barry Levinson were at the very beginnings of the rides of their respective lives with Homicide: Life on the Street. The entire cast is full of stars (and a few director cameos); about the least-known name on the list, at the time, was Mira Sorvino, whose big break came the next year. This is a movie that had everything going for it from day one. It still amazes me how often you can say that about a movie that ends up crashing and burning, but Quiz Show is not one of those movies. The acting and script are, of course, exceptional, as is Redford's direction. The pacing is phenomenal, even more impressive given the movies two-hour-plus running time (common in other countries, but almost unheard-of  in America). At least two critics have called it one of the thousand best films ever made (it made both the Guardian list and Peter Travers' list for Rolling Stone), and there is certainly some merit to the claim; this movie is great fun to watch, and as the events get more absurd, the more fun it is. What really puts the cherry on the sundae is that hey, this stuff really happened. ****pacing is phenomenal, even more impressive given the movies two-hour-plus running time (common in other countries, but almost unheard-of  in America).

075640407X|5.0|I've never been overly fond of frame stories, but in spite of that, it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book as thoroughly as I enjoyed this one. The outer frame to the inner story was still not as enjoyable as the actual inner story, but it was not bad in and of itself. I also have a tendancy to dislike the inclination, all too common these days, to write a trilogy (or longer series) and end each book at an unsatisfying break-point. This book is better than most in this regard, but I have to think that there was a better place in the story to end this book than the one chosen. It wasn't a cliffhanger, but there was no sense of one tale being completed while another was waiting to happen, which is my preference. Still, the story (both stories, actually) was (were) well-told enough that I can't give it less than five stars, despite having quibbles. The characters were wonderful, fully realized and plausible in spite of inhabiting a fantasy. The main character lost none of his humanity for being larger-than-life, possibly the best job of humanizing an incredibly talented character that I've ever seen, and the love interest was again a very real, very plausible character, and the relationship itself was a rather pleasant change of pace from what we expect. The pacing was excellent, the switches between the frame and the inner story timed well even on the rare occasions when they weren't smooth and unobtrusive, the background of the world was interesting, the language evocative without being overly flowery, the magic system as plausible as any and more so than most.<br /><br />Definitely a series that bears watching.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Yep, that's right. I'm not a fan of Britney for all the obvious reasons, like extremely poor judgment, stupidity, lack of actual talent, etc. But...I was in the mood for some pop fluff with good beats. This fits the bill. It's a very enjoyable CD. Yes, the vocals are very computerized-sounding, but I think it goes well with the music. It's part of the whole sound.  I really like Break the Ice, Gimme More, and Toy Soldier.  Now for some things I don't like. I can't stand when artists are constantly referring to themselves by name in songs. This makes sense in Piece of Me, but in many other tracks Britney is either referring to herself in the third person or having some male vocalist saying her name. I don't like it when regular people do this either. Makes them seem completely full of themselves in a desperate way. Britney seems pretty full of herself on this CD. It's all the same unoriginal theme. In almost every track, she does that creepy whisper moaning thing about how she wants to F someone, or how someone wants to F her, or how hot she thinks she is. On at least two tracks, she (or a male vocalist) refers to herself as legendary, LOL!  Can't she think of anything else to say at all? Now some rabid fans complain that others are judging her record based on her persona and not just the music, but when every song is about her persona, it's hard not to. But in the end, the lyrics don't matter much and neither does the vocalist herself.  The CD is fun, good for working out to, and perking yourself up during a boring commute. Overall, I would recommend it.
0446677450|3.0|The TV special, which was responsible for my purchase of this book, was better and seemingly more informative than the actual book.  How can that be?  I thought the book was an easy read, but there were so many points repeated in it that it seemed like it could be condensed into a length half as long.  Also, the author continues to compare and contrast between his \\"two dads,\\" but not everyone has had a similar experience and can relate.  Obviously, there is 5-star financial advice to be had here, but I'm not so sure that you will read this book twice to get it.

B000W1V44I|5.0|It's great to see the US releasing a version with extra tracks for a change, instead of fans being forced to buy an import CD that costs from 30 to 40 dollars. Although, that doesn't negate the fact that they should still just release ONE version with ALL the songs on it, considering they have the room on the CD, rather than making us spend more money to get tracks that could fit on the CD anyway.<br /><br />Either way, both \\"Downpour\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" are sophisticated, melodic power ballads that the Backstreet Boys get better and better at with age. No filler here. These are must have tracks for fans.
B000002ULO|4.0|The beginning of McCartney's later day career renaissance    Bob Dylan in a recent interview has said there's really only one person in music today that to him is absolutely stunning.  That person, naturally, is Paul McCartney.  \\"\\"I'm in awe of McCartney. He's about the only one that I am in awe of. He can do it all. And he's never let up... He's just so damn effortless.\\"  (Taken from a Rolling Stone interview from summer 2007).    High praise from someone so iconic as Bob Dylan.  The last ten years for both McCartney and Dylan have proven them to be the most interesting artists of their generation currently recording.  Over the last decade, both Dylan and McCartney have had a massive resurgence in their careers.  While each are following their own idiosyncractic paths, both have proven themselves to have remarkable fertile songwriting during this stage in their careers.      And here's the trick.  Both are the best at what they do.  Sure, you can't imagine Paul McCartney being able to pull of the effortless aural history lessons in songs Dylan has been doing, each steeped in the American tradition and that \\"Old, Weird, America\\" of the Anthology of American Folk Music.  Come on, could Paul really write \\"Nettie Moore\\", \\"Ain't Talkin'\\", \\"Mississippi\\", \\"Things Have Changed,\\" \\"Tell Ol' Bill\\", or the masterpiece \\"Cross the Green Mountain\\"?  But then again, you can't see Dylan writing the effortless melodic pop masterpieces McCartney written in FLAMING PIE, DRIVING RAIN, CHAOS & CREATION IN THE BACKYARD (one of my favorite albums of the 2000s), or MEMORY ALMOST FULL.    When FLAMING PIE hit the stores in 1997, four years separate it from McCartney's previous studio offering, OFF THE GROUND.  A lot happened during those four years, namely, The Beatles multi-media project THE ANTHOLOGY.  The ANTHOLOGY was a massive undertaking, resulting in three double albums of outtakes, a massive coffee-table book that really is one of the definitive resources for us Beatles nuts, and then the hours long documentary as well.  Anything like that may get you thinking McCartney would really be in a reflective mood about mortality and unusually somber.  Well, not really (the somber, reflective McCartney would come out in his 2005 masterpiece CHAOS).    Instead, according to the liner notes, the Anthology project would be a refresher course on how to construct a well-made song.  And FLAMING PIE is full of such songs.  According to Wikipedia, \\"McCartney sporadically recorded the entire album in a space of two years, working not only with Lynne, but with Steve Miller, George Martin, Ringo Starr and his own son, James McCartney, who plays lead guitar on \\"Heaven on a Sunday\\". \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Great Day\\" both hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out.\\"  McCartney recorded the album in the space of two years.    The album is really a return to the basic sensibilities that produced records like MCCARTNEY.  The music, while carefully considered, doesn't get bogged down in rather pretentious production styles.  It's carefully produced, but the music has much more of a live feel to it.  While there are a couple of sore spots (the collobaration with Steve Miller always strikes me as generic 1970s rock), this is an album I find myself returning to again and again.  It's that good.  \\"Flaming Pie\\", the song, is just a basic rock and roll song, and while it's drawn from the Lennon story about the man on the flaming pie telling him in a dream they shall be The Beatles with an A, the song's one of the poorer ones on the record.  But the rest is great, whether it's the Beatles send up \\"Song We Were Singing\\" (one of Paul's best, and just makes you smile), his refletive ballads, or just gorgeous orchestration. McCartney has always been amazing with melodies, and this record has it in spades.    Buy it.  The last ten years have made both Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney extraordinarily more relevant than you could hope for if you followed their careers in the 1980s (especially Dylan). And don't worry.  McCartney only gets better from this starting point in his discography.  Make sure you pick up his other studio albums post dating this - there just as good, and in some cases (CHAOS), better.    McCartney has proven himself to be truly remarkable, and he has released some of his strongest music of his solo career in 1997-2007.   He has proven himself remarkably consistent in the following releases.   This is the starting point for his new critical revival, but thank God and thank love this isn't the ending point.

1401300529|5.0|When I joined the Army in 1959 the Korean War had been over for six years. Many of the veterans who fought there were still in the Army as instructors in basic and advanced training, or were leaders in combat units. I talked to soldiers who fought in Korea and were there, at Chosin and elsewhere, when the Chinese came across the Yalu river. It would never have occurred to me then that the Korean War was fast becoming the Forgotten War. I had been afraid at one point in my very young life that I would have to fight there and it was a great relief when the cease-fire was signed in 1953. It was also a great relief to most of the country, at least to those who knew enough to care, that the fighting had stopped at last. What they wanted most was to put war behind them and forget about it. This is what they did. I was never to see it that way, and was incredulous when I realized that the war had truly been forgotten, along with the soldiers, Marines, and others who fought there. I heard the bitterness in the voices of some of those men, and listened to their stories (when they would talk at all), with the realization that for them the war would never be over. Later I served in Korea myself, but I never understood the overall history of what happened in Korea, and why, until I read David Halberstam's book, THE COLDEST WINTER.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to understand the Korean War, the history of what led up to it and what followed, as well as the war itself, owes it to themselves to read THE COLDEST WINTER. The accounts in this book speak with the same authority and straightforward simplicity of those who fought and suffered there as did the Korean vets I listened to as they told of waking up one sub-zero winter morning to the sound of Chinese bugles. Halberstam makes clear what happened there as clearly as he shows us that the U.S. government has continued to make the same mistakes in Vietnam and Iraq: mistakes that have cost thousands of American servicemen and women their lives.  It shouldn't be forgotten. The price of forgetting is too great. Thanks to David Halberstam for THE COLDEST WINTER. His voice will be greatly missed.ves.  It shouldn't be forgotten.

B000002MIB|3.0|Review # 48. This live 2-CD catalog title by the almighty powerful Van {wailing} Halen is simply too 'routine' for me. Not that it's a bad offering of their live performances. It just gets old fast. Tunes like \\"Poundcake\\", the uplifting \\"Ain't Talking About Love\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\", \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\", their Who cover \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and the WAY over-played \\"Jump\\" are always good to hear but perhaps I've heard a few too many bootlegs of theirs to get all tanked up about this legit release. I honestly believe that female fans just might possibly get more out of 'Live: Right Here, Right' than their male companions.

B000WSJNWQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this film, you might savor it more if you skimp on the reading and just did. I am not sure how it was billed by marketing, but it is heartbreaking to see something of this caliber miss the radars just because its politics did not agree with your typical Hollywood audiences.<br /><br />It is a taut CIA procedural with a feast of acting, storytelling, music -- what's not to like? Don't expect a standard-issue \\"suspense thriller\\" as the story lays its cards well ahead of the game, but it carries its moral heft with a delightfully interlaced narrative. For the inquisitive or the blissfully ignorant, may I recommend [[ASIN:031236024X Ghost Plane]] by Stephen Grey, a journalist from The Sunday Times who had to leave his job to pursue an investigation into CIA's \\"Extraordinary Rendition\\" witness torture program. As such, the film merely makes a real practice more accessible by couching it in a story of perfectly believable people. The web of inter-relationships among its characters is real, and thought-provoking.<br /><br />The acting is top class. The going objection seems to be that Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon were under-utilized. I feel it is not absolutely necessary for every Hollywood film to have a pronounced hero-heroine routine with a vehicle for stardom, so I found Gyllenhaal's understated take on a burned-out CIA paper-pusher endearing. Witherspoon turns in an unassuming depiction of a regular wife whose husband has gone missing under strange circumstances. Meryl Streep is what only she can be: a stony bureaucratic bigwig who gives us a candid view of the dark political apparatus in Washington. But perhaps the most memorable character is played by a relatively unknown actor, Yigal Naor, as an officious jailer trying to herd his squirrels amidst the chaos of fervid causes.<br /><br />Long story short: ignore the naysayers and watch it. As in the case of hard-to-digest thrillers such as [[ASIN:B00005221K The Siege]] with Denzel Washington, which too was bang on, the overall disinterest in this film is misleading. Discerning viewers cannot go wrong.too was bang on, the overall disinterest in this film is misleading. Discerning viewers cannot go wrong.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Let's talk frankly, I'm in the Roger Waters camp, definitely, and I think everything Pink Floyd has made without Roger is at the best This Is Spinal Tap. I've gone to see David Gilmour in Vienne in 2006 just two weeks after Roger Waters in Magny Cour. The Roger Waters concert is one of the best I've ever seen, and first I didn't want to go to see Gilmour, but as far as he was playing Echoes I was curious to hear it. During the Gilmour concert, my mind was still with Roger and by the time, I didn't get at all in the new material of Davi.I felt it was boring, I prefered by far the second part of the show with Echoes as the sherry on the cake. So I bought that DVD and finally, I had a revelation, I got into the new material from Island. In fact Gilmour is really good when he is free from Pink Floyd, when he doesn't try to imitate Pink Floyd, when he plays Gilmour Music. He recognised it himself in the documentary, that's almost pathetic when he says that this is the best material he has made for 30 years. I should rather say that this is the first good material he has ever done.

B000W1V44I|4.0|I've LOVED LOVED LOVED BSB's music from their first album BACKSTREET BOYS in 1997 to their prior album NEVER GONE in 2005. What I loved was the pop about it--- the upbeat beats and the hooky, catchy choruses...<br />UNBREAKABLE lacks this big time. Too many of the tracks are adult-contemporary sounding, which definitely is a different style for them (as was the very pop/rock, eclectic NEVER GONE). This definitely shows their musical growth but it doesn't make them a boyband anymore :(<br />Out of all their albums, this is the only one that I didn't immediately love--- a lot of the songs had to (and some still have to) grow on me. My fav tracks for me so far are: PANIC, EVERYTHING BUT MINE, ONE IN A MILLION and TREAT ME RIGHT. But I also really enjoy: INCONSOLABLE, YOU CAN LET GO, ANY OTHER WAY, SOMETHING THAT I ALREADY WAY, DOWNPOUR and IN PIECES (the 2 bonus tracks).<br />I know the boys couldn't make pop music forever but I was sorta hoping they would.<br />I am really glad they're still making music and I hope if they make a 6th album, is a little closer to their boyband roots (though I doubt it!) If not, I'll always have the music of their 3 classic albums (BACKSTREET BOYS, MILLENNIUM and BLACK AND BLUE) to keep my ears especially happy :)

Any of her songs will make you wanna get up and shake it!!!<br /><br />BLACKOUT is a fun album so if you want that, def. pick up a copy!<br /><br />***BLACKOUT is the #1 album!!! HA! to the critics and ppl who thought it would flop. Brit truly and still is the queen of pop!!!***
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is great if you love pop and Britney Spears. The only thing that would have made this album better is if she put a good ballad on it. All of the songs are mid-tempo or fast. They are all catchy tunes though which is why I gave this album 5 stars. Britney doesn't fail to bring good catchy music to her cd's. My favorites are Heaven on Earth and Toy Soldier. Great cd but my not my favorite out of her cd's. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.

STOP ALREADY!!!\\" are of:<br />---a man being beaten in the head repeatedly until his face is no longer a face, but a bloody pulp.<br />---monica belluci's character being sodimized for over 10 minutes!!! then being punched and kicked in the face.<br /><br />i'm not a very squeamish person but the realism of those scenes, esp. the rape scene caused me to look away at some points and fast forward a bit because it was too much.<br /><br />if you want to see a movie unlike most out there, for the overall innovative look of it, check out IRREVERSIBLE.

I have to say it is so far the most awesomely fantastic books i have read so far!
B00006LSM3|3.0|(3.5 stars)<br /><br />While it's always hard to fairly judge a posthumous album, I personally felt kind of disappointed by this one.  Like most albums, it did seem a bit better after multiple listens, but it's not an album that has grown on me so much I'd consider it a favorite.  We all know that George never made any album that topped ATMP, but even apart from that unique masterpiece in a class all by itself, this still isn't what I would consider one of his best strongest solo albums.  All of his other solo albums that I've heard so far (as of the date of this writing, I still have yet to hear 'Gone Troppo' and 'Thirty-Three & 1/3') have made me feel something, stirred up emotions and feelings.  Even the awful 'Extra Texture' made me feel horror and embarrassment at how bad it is.  But this album, by and large, just doesn't move me.  It's what I'd consider just okay, not awful and not fantastic.  Although perhaps if Jeff Lynne hadn't fouled up the production so much, I would like it more.<br /><br />The main reason I just don't feel any strong feelings towards this album is because so many of the songs are at a rather boring mid-tempo pace.  A couple of mid-tempo numbers might have been okay, but on an entire album full of them, they can start to sound all the same after awhile, though if they came up separately on the radio or a play list I don't think most of them would feel so uninspired and unoriginal.  A lot of them sound like they'd be better-suited to an entirely different artist, though again, this may in large part be due to Jeff Lynne's overproduction.  This man should stick to what he knows and stop trying to be a record producer.  While he did do a good job producing 'Cloud Nine,' that production style just fit with the songs, and it was after all the Eighties.  Even the songs that do have some really nice lyrics, like 'Pisces Fish' (which I wish I could like more given the lovely lyrics), are compromised by this boring mid-tempo pace.  Very few of these songs actually go somewhere and have hooks and catchy lyrics.<br /><br />However, I do like some of the songs on the album.  \\"Any Road\\" is easily the best track, and is the perfect opener.  It's got a catchy chorus, great lyrics, great hooks, an upbeat mood, and actually goes somewhere.  \\"Marwa Blues,\\" the instrumental, is another of my favorite tracks.  It's really beautiful and atmospheric.  Others I really like are \\"Looking for My Life\\" (one of the few songs that has a catchy chorus and hooks), \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" (a really fun upbeat cover song), and the title track.  Since I'm a very spiritual person myself, I love the song's lyrics about our search for and relationship with the Divine.  The Hindu chanting at the end is also very moving and powerful.  I sort of like \\"Pisces Fish,\\" but I just can't like it as much as I'd like to given the mid-tempo pace and the absence of any real hooks.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is cluttered with the abovementioned mid-tempo songs that just never go anywhere musically or lyrically, like \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud,\\" \\"Rising Sun,\\" and \\"Run So Far.\\"  My least-favorite song is probably \\"Last Saturday Night.\\"  I'm kind of disappointed to learn a bunch of these songs were leftovers from years ago instead of more recent ones from the late Nineties and early Aughts.  The liner notes also left a bit to be desired.  I would have appreciated some notes on the making of the album, not just lyrics and the beautiful dedication.<br /><br />Still, this album does seem very heartfelt and genuine, and is at least a whole other level above 'Extra Texture.'  It's not an album I see myself returning to again and again like with some of his other solo albums, but it isn't the worst way to kill some time.  And in spite of the overall mid-tempo mood, there are some true gems hidden in here.  I get the feeling that there was a much better album in here waiting to be let out, but given the usual problems associated withputting together a posthumous album and coupled with Jeff Lynne's typical production values, it just wasn't brought to its full potential.album and coupled with Jeff Lynne's typical production values, it just wasn't brought to its full potential.
B000OY8NII|5.0|this has to be one of the best series on tv last year.  because it is on the sifi channel no one in ego town will put it up for an award.  it was quirky, funny and surreal.  not your usual fare.
0385751532|5.0|There's nothing simple about this tale.  Many criticize Bruno's unrealistic naivete.  This boy is nine years old:  what is our excuse?  This fable extends beyond the Holocaust.  We too are blind to the injustices around us, and Boyne's book chillingly depicts this.    Bruno's not so different from many who destroy others to protect themselves.  Yet, despite his flaws, he's human enough to love, to reach out to another.  He is ignorant of his effect on another reaching out for him; nevertheless, he reaches for the hand of one in need.  In doing so, he sacrifices a part of himself.    This story alternates between being beautiful and unnerving.  Despite the devasting ending, one knows this must be the result.  When we take from others, we kill our own souls.  I have recommended this book to everyone--even to those reluctant readers.  It is unforgettable.
0743201140|1.0|As so many other reviewers have noted, the basic premise of this book is logical - identify and use your strengths, minimize time and effort applied to using and fixing your weak areas.  What the title promises is to help you \\"discover\\" your strengths through the use of the online testing tool.  After taking the test you receive a \\"report\\" with a rather simplistic summary description of each of your top five strengths (out of the 34 possible that they identify).  As one reviewer noted, this information might be illuminating to a young person starting their career, but most self-aware adults who have been in the world of work for a while will probably find that the results either confirm what they already know about themselves or as others have noted, give every indication of being innacurate.  My experience was that 4 of the top 5 essentially confirmed what I already knew and the fifth (Adaptability) was only a partial fit according to the authors' description of it.  My real interest was in the whole picture of the full spectrum of my strengths and weaknesses.  Do I only have 5 strengths and everything else is a weakness I should avoid?  Do I have other strengths that can be used in conjunction with or support of these top 5?  The website offers me the \\"opportunity\\" to learn about my strengths 6-34 but only if I plunk down $550 for a one-hour (that's $550 for ONE HOUR) long call with a \\"Strengths Performance Coach\\" for an \\"in-depth\\" consulting session.  So by my math, that means approximately 2 minutes per additional item - hardly in-depth.  IMHO this is an outrageous amount of money to pay on top of the price of the book simply to see the complete results of the test.    Aside from that issue, the book provides superficial descriptions of the various strengths but no real content regarding what to do with the information regarding your top 5, how to map them to roles or do much of anything else with them.  The only section I felt had any real practical value was about managing people with different strengths - useful if simplistic and it slightly fleshed out the profiles of the strengths previously mentioned.    This would have at least some value as a means of gaining self knowledge if one could get the full results of the test (without paying an exorbitant sum for \\"consulting\\").  Ideally this would be included in the results by default but if not Gallup should at least offer this option and at a reasonable price.  Without any additional information regarding where the other 29 characteristics fall in my profile, knowing the top 5 is like having a recipe with 34 ingredients, but only knowing the proper amounts for 5 of them and no direction on mixing and cooking time.  This book feels more like a sales pitch for very expensive consulting services than anything from which the average person seeking self knowledge will benefit.  If you are looking for some in-depth insight into your strengths and temperment, you'll get more bang for your buck by taking the Myers-Briggs, the Kiersey Temperament Sorter or working through What Color is Your Parachute.
B00005JPFH|2.0|I wish it wasn't true, but I feel this is the Batman Forever of the Spiderman franchise: slightly goofy, overburdened with interesting villains who have no time in the spotlight- and the waste of truly great potential.<br />Even after hearing some of the bad press that this movie received, I still watched it expecting to enjoy at least some of it. Unfortunately, Spiderman 3 is the victim of greedy producer's wishes, an overstuffed script, and an overworked director.<br /><br />Had this been the script for the first Spiderman film, it never would have gone into production. But because the franchise is a formidable money making beast, the studio pushed ahead through bad writing and re-shoot after re-shoot.<br /><br />Production for Spiderman 3 started before Spiderman 2 was even released (originally centrally focusing on the Vulture). The release date was set before the crew even had a chance to take a break from the last film. Contributing to the already fatigued crew- producer Avi Arad insisted that Venom be injected into the ALREADY overburdened script solely because of Venom's large fan-base. Additionally, Sam and Ivan Raimi re-worked the script to fit in Sandman because they found him \\"visually interesting\\" - and later, \\"an interesting protagonist\\" - yet they allow no time for the character to develop. As a result of these poorly thought out additions, the script crumbles under the burden of awful rewrites, appalling plot points, and the thinnest of thin dialogues.<br /><br />The development of Peter Parker's dark side takes place in a matter of moments, and is (at times) unintentionally hilarious. Realizing this, it feels as if Raimi intentionally overplayed the humor in an attempt to hide the weak writing and time development constraints.<br />What should have been fleshed out in the film's first half - the symbiote bonding to Peter, his rage and power hunger growing, the realization that the suit is a symbiotic life form are all \\"captured\\" in the course of 60 seconds (Dr. Connor's and Peter's reactions to the discovery of a seemingly alien life form is watered down to three lines of dialogue!) Venom comes off as an afterthought.<br />Plot holes abound as interesting story points are overlooked in favor of cramming more and more into a two hour film. Sandman spends 3/4 of his time in the film GRUNTING without reason like some sort of sand gorilla. Venom is a squandered villain- a tired, watered down, flawed attempt to capture an audience who would pay to see the film simply because they love the character. In place of a scary, drooling grimace, we get Topher Grace in a black suit with teeth for 15 minutes of screen time. Peter Parker is jazz dancing when he should be letting his moral standing slip, drunk with power.<br /><br />The weak writing is maddening:<br />Amnesiac Green Goblin Jr? Please. You should have killed him in the first half and spared us the forced team up \\"action\\".<br />MJ playing along with Harry's plot for revenge because she (apparently) feared for her life, despite NOT knowing that Harry actually has superstrength and standing beside Spiderman himself? Why should she have reason to fear for her life?<br />Sandman (whose only motivation was money) teaming up with Venom for seemingly no reason or profit? Is Venom sitting on millions of dollars that I don't know about?<br />And my favorite: Oops, actually THIS GUY killed your uncle.<br />Thanks for taking the easy way out Sam and team.<br /><br />What should have been a dark and tragic film about fall of a hero is instead a funny and campy film about Peter Parker and Mary Jane's trouble at home- which itself is not given enough dialogue to feel real. What could have been truly dramatic moments are hard to digest because there is no character development to back it up.<br /><br />Let's hope Raimi either takes a break or hands the franchise over to someone who has the energy and willpower to say \\"no\\".<br /><br />AND LET SPIDEY KEEP HIS MASK ON!!!!'s reactions to the discovery of a seemingly alien life form is watered down to three lines of dialogue!)

0743556003|5.0|Loved her voice and the way she carried out the story. For me, she is Lisey, she delivered the heart and soul of Stephen. The story itself is very personal, honest. I like Stephen for his way of storytelling, not so much of the horror, but he has a way of getting in the core of the charactor, makes you quickly drawn to them like they are someone you know. The comoradary between sisters are so moving, at times hilarious. This, to me, is his best work so far. get it.

However, his assistance is needed with the Witted and the disapperance of a young prince who is due to make political alliance.    Fitz is back on the slippery slope in another fine Farseer book, the first in a new trilogy. The writing again doesn't disappoint.
B000002AGN|4.0|This is a great album.  I have a friend who wore out his vinyl version of this.  There's some great stuff here, and if you are a huge fan of the quarteet, then I recommend this.  However, I think the Carnegie Hall concert recording is superior - so if you are only going to get one DB CD, get that one instead.  On this CD, the quartet is still just getting used to the unusual time signatures, whereas by the time they get to Carnegie Hall, 9/8, 11/4, 5/4, whatever, it's in their DNA and it shows.

A science company working on nanotechnology has a problem, because of some corner cutting and the other usual corporate dodginess despite some critical advice they have a nano-organism released into the wild, and it is not a big fan of the humans that created it.    A horror novel situation from there pretty much as they try and stop it and stay alive.      2.5 out of 5
B000RC2EH8|4.0|If you are a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles than make sure you catch this latest movie.  The action and CG are pretty amazing and, except when humans are on the screen, you tend to forget that you are watching a computer generated cartoon.    And the humans are the only thing that ruined this.  Because this wasn't a live action recording with a bunch of blue screen the humans tend to ruin it.  The problem is that they are a little bit too cartoony.  It is bad when the mutant ninja turtles are more life-like than the humans.  I was about to complain that this should have been live-action but I think that would have quadrupled the budget because, other than the humans, all the other life-forms are animals and monsters.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|I love Avenged just as much as the next person; their previous 2 albums are incredible and will go down as classic masterpieces. The new album however falls short of even holding a candle to anything else they have done. First of all, the opening tune sounds like it has a rip off of an old Megadeth riff and then the vocals are reminiscent of Korn, and the ridiculous rants and raves just aren't convincing and fall short of the vibe they are trying so hard to achieve. Track 4 starts off good but in the end sounds like something that wouldn't have made the cut on city of evil. Track 2 has what sounds like an old Metallica riff. Then there is this nightmare before Christmas sounding song that is a mess. It's almost as if they thought, this sounds too close to Disney, let's throw some cuss words in there to make it more hardcore! And the rest of the lyrics on the disc are atrocious, including those bad vocal effects that someone else said Cher had used. All in All a very forgettable album which has more in common with Emo than it does with metal. When you hear such a great band make such bad slop a few things come to mind such as 1) they are in such a fame and riches induced haze they start over thinking things and experimenting way to much. They desperately needed a real producer on this and might have been able to somewhat salvage what they brought to the table and be pointed in a better direction. 2) They just flat ran out of good ideas and with pressures from the label and everything else, they had to put something out that might be rushed and not really what they were going for. I predict this Album won't even go gold, if it does it will be because people like me buy it the first day based on what they have done previously. I really like the band and hope they do well despite of everything because they seem like great guys and who knows, this might just be a throwaway and they could have a killer comeback in the future but for now they are on a downslide and it's a shame.shame.
B000Y179KO|5.0|28 years after their last studio album, four remaining Eagles release a new album.  Long Road out of Eden features 2 discs and 20 new tracks.  Disc 1 is described as being a re-introduction to the band with the opening track a post nuclear vision of Seven Bridges Rd, followed by a song they forgot to record 35 years ago \\"How Long\\" by long time friend JD Souther.  This stamps Eagles all over it and just gets better each time you hear it.  Harmonies and all the little things which most bands would overlook, make this a classic already in the Take it Easy, Already Gone genre.  Next up is Busy Being Fabulous which is an update of Those Shoes with a killer chorus and typically cynical Henley lyric.  Has the Eagles sound.  Next is a weepie with a countrified Frey vocal.  Quite nice, Walsh steps up next with Guilyy of the Crime, whilst being pleasant is a little removed from the other material on this disc.  Next up is the first of Tim Schmit's spots with a brilliant (single written all over it)I Don't want to Hear Anymore, is simply brilliant.  Won't fit on contemporary radio but anyone reading this won't care anyway.  Disc 1's highlight follows with Waiting in the Weeds.  How to describe this song?  It starts of as an acoustic, black, Henley vocal and shifts into an epic from 1st Chorus/Bridge on when Schmit/Frey's harmonies kick in.  Its low fi, acoustic guitars and mandolin, but segues into something much more, the lyrics tell so many stories with multi dimensions and layers.  By the end of the 7 minutes its a totally different beast, with an undeniable stamp of class.  This track makes the 28 year wait all worth it.      After Weeds, all the other would seem insubstantial but in true Eagles tradition the material all stands up.  No More Cloudy Days will have its fans, followed by Henley doing his best Bee Gee's impression on Fast Company.  This has a killer chorus and will grow on you. Next up is a piece of Schmit brilliance with Do Something, more like his Poco work& Frey closes with another highlight You Are Not Alone.    If that wasn't enough we still have another whole disc, with the title track starting it off.  This track will need some play to make it accessible but already the biting lyrics, killer Walsh guitar and atmospherics make it a dramatic, masterful tune.  Long time collaborater, Jack Tempchin pitches in with a Frey lead vocal, Somebody which is a foot stomper.  Henley next with Frail Grasp of the Big Picture, very Inside Job-like.  Walsh with a JD Souther assist comes up with the Steely Dan like Last Good Time in Town.  Frey with I like to watch a Woman Dance, is low-fi and voyeuristic, but pleasant, Three songs left, all good especially Centre of the Universe which is a modern update of the whole sound.  I'm still trying to decide what the lyrics mean but I'm sure George W Bush won't download it.  Business as Usual is another which could be a Henley single but has the superb Eagles harmony support.  Slightly rocky, confrontational, another winner.  Then the closer which if its the last song ever from the Eagles then its a fitting epitaph, lets hope its not, as this album has proved that the Eagles biggest fear is unfounded and that they are still important, vibrant, and quite simply America's greatest ever rock band.
B000VS6P9Q|2.0|The music is too theatrically produced to work without a film to go along with it--I am not sure I will ever truly understand why anyone would ever want to listen to a cover of Dylan when the real thing is so different and so far superior, or for that matter why some artists that I greatly enjoy and respect would think that covering a version of Dylan's many masterpieces in their own (sometimes too modern) tone is a good idea.  This collection does a disservice to Dylan's music (save BD's version on Disc 2).
B00001OH7U|4.0|Well The Thin White Duke does it again!  One of my all time favorite songs whenever I feel out-of-it with the world is \\"Wild is the Wind\\".  It reminds me that here I belong.   \\"Stay\\" reinforces that notion! Great palate of Bowie Moods ~
0891419195|5.0|if you want to read what it was like to be a \\"grunt\\" slogging through the WWII Pacific island battles, this is the book for you.  Sledge was a grunt and proud to be a grunt.  He did not know the bigger schemes.  He was not responsible for decisive group moves - he did what he was told and hoped and hoped to get out alive.  From some one who experienced something that I never will, a very good read.  I found it hard to put this down.<br />I'm very grateful to Mr. Sledge for his efforts both during the war and in the telling of it.

0143034901|5.0|I finished The Shadow of the Wind the very same day that Spain's government got around to officially condemning General Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship (1936-1975). If you're wondering why it took over three decades after Franco's death for the Spanish Parliament to blacklist this blackheart, this wonderfully melancholic and overwrought novel will help you understand.<br /><br />The wounds from Spain's Civil War run deep in Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's novel. There are ample plot synopses on the hundreds of other reader reviews here, so I'll just add that in addition to its colorful cast of characters (notably the utterly villainous Fumero) and its tales of murder and madness, this is a very funny book. Time after time I found myself chuckling at an amusing (translated!) turn of phrase, or at something the irrepressible Ferm&iacute;n had done.<br /><br />So while the real-life Spanish continue their searches for mass graves from Franco's regime, give yourself over to Zafon's novel. It requires periodic suspension of disbelief, but it's for a good cause: Poignant sighs and good reading. Highly recommended.<br /><br />See also: Any Arturo Perez-Reverte novel (e.g., [[ASIN:B000OZ1SV6 Captain Alatriste]]  ), or the exceptional film [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]].

I'm certain these 2 discs will be great, but where is Jeff Beck's astounding version of the Beatles \\"A Day In The Life\\" ??? It was a show-stopper !!

0446698326|1.0|I really enjoyed this book but just couldn't believe the ending. I know that I should be prepare for it after reading first chapter, but somehow I though there is no way these two won't be together.  I would give it 5 stars if only the ending would be different.After reading that John sold his dad's coins that he was collecting for all his life to save Tim ( by the way he didn't have any guarantee that he will save his life! And who would do that after the guy stole the love of his life?! ).  And to write that the realetionship between John and Savannah would never work after all that happened to them!!!! How in the world relationship with Tim would ????? Obviousely Savannah is still madely in love with Jim and still looking up to the moon and thinking about him constantly.How Tim can be with her knowing that? This just shows how nice guy he is.....   The ending made me feel like I wasted my time on this book. I will never read Sparks book again.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I bought this for the song Put Your Records On, thats all I knew about this CD...I liked how someone sang it on American Idol...so I was buying this on blind faith and hoping I would like it.  I figured I would like a few songs and it would be shelved for a long time.  I don't like jazz or blues music that much, but I LOVE this CD.  I think she has a great voice, how someone can call it monotone I don't know, but it draws you in and the stories with the songs are just perfect.  I wanted to buy more of her songs, but there aren't any yet, come on Corinne, get recording!  As for comparison I had bought Norah Jones also in the past, but that one didn't go anywhere with me, it got shelved pretty quick, Corinne has a whole different style and voice.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's second novel is anything but sunny.  About the only place I found any was in the oft-quoted poem which has the phrase: \\"a thousand splendid suns\\".  The culture of Afghanistan, being what it is, does not and maybe never has provided a joyous existence.  In the story, Men mistreat women and each other to the point of a kind of ridiculous sadism where no one gains anything positive from life.<br /><br />On the other hand, a saving grace may be that Mr Hosseini is a master at character development and interaction.  And his novel has another feature that as a reader I insist upon: a happy ending.

076790382X|2.0|Thankfully, this was not the first Bryson book I read; because if it was, there would not have been a second.<br /><br />All the maturity, wit and history he uses to make other books of his like \\"In a Sunburned Country,\\" \\"The Lost Continent\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" decent reads are unavailable here.<br /><br />Instead, here, Bryson is dull. Anyone who leaves America for Eurabia by choice has to have a screw loose, and Bryson is guilty as charged.<br /><br />Like most of his books, the furtive mocking of Americans is evident, and overall, as other reviewers indicated, the jokes are mundane.<br /><br />I'm reviewing this book negatively, since, if you're going to put together a rambling 300 page book, that's enough pages to get into more detail about the local people as well as commentaries on places other than cliche sites. The typical Bryon stories and side comments are not as \\"witty\\" as usual either. Much of the writing seems selfish, especially his usual ordeals. It reminded me of a professor, hippie or Steven Colbert pontificating. That's bad if you're over 16.<br /><br />Many folks either love or hate Bryson. I'm in the middle. He is a good writer and I have read about seven of his books. He's also preachy, condescending and elitist. Take the bad with the good, I suppose.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is one of the few death metal/ grindcore albums that i find listenable. It's not just fast. It's not just aggressive. It's not just techincally impressive. It's beautiful. This album is absolutely brutally mercilessly gorgeous.  The songs are suprisingly melodic and accessible, but at the same time they are not spoon fed to you. This is for that metal itch that you just couldn't scratch before.
0618680004|1.0|Dear Readers:    After checking out \\"The God Delusion\\" from the library, I was saddened because of the author's stance.  God is real and because God sent Jesus into this world so humans could receive forgiveness of their sins, an eternal life with God and Jesus is possible.      I, being a sociologist, have witnessed behaviors exacted from people who advanced the myth(s) that either God is dead or God never existed.  God is good and through the Holy Bible, we learn about agape love, hope, forgiveness, forbearance, patience, kindness, and other moral values that most cultural universals have either forgotten or omitted.      Are scientists so lacking in faith that they must have evidences of God's existence?  Especially when the Holy Bible acknowledges that whoever looks upon God's face shall perish.  And are scientists so ignorant that they know that ignoring moral values will lead to disorder?      Don't we have enough selfishness, corruption, and lack of morality in several cultures without abandoning and/or questioning God's existence?    Respectfully,  Sharon Rabon
