030758836X|1.0|When I began this book, I had great hopes. And the book did not let me down. It would have been the best book I've read all summer, had it not been for the ending. Anticlimax is putting it lightly. I'm so frustrated right now at wasting my time. I got so involved in this book; so involved in the characters. I couldn't wait to pass it on to my other book-loving friends. Yeah, well...now it's being donated to Goodwill. No one should have to pay for this book...for this ending. And I'm not a fairytale - all must end well - kind of a girl. I love a good twist and turn. But this...I feel led along, and led astray and led...in the end...NOWHERE. Don't waste your time.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|I was waiting a long time to receive this item because I'm a die hard TWD fan. When I received it, you can only imagine what happened to the packaging as I super-hurried the unwrapping process lol. All the excitement was brought down once I got a good view of the product. It appears it has a slight crack on the side base of the stand that holds the head. Not only that, but someone appeared to try to touch it up with some kind of glue or substance that left quite a mark all over the side. I decided to inspect the rest of it, the cd's and all. In the middle of all four cd's is some kind of paste-like substance smeared right where the hole is. I wiped this off without a problem but noticed one cd had some kind of warp-like dots next to the hole. The cd plays fine and the head takes the screwdriver like a pro so I really have no need to return it. It's just cosmetic damages. Aside from the fact that my product is damamged with some weird cosmetic defects, it works as it should. The cosmetic damages are the only thing keeping this from getting a 5 star rating.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|simple, challenging and addicting. a fun (sometimes frustrating) little game that makes me want to conquer it. my 6 yr old also loves it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I felt like I was there: hiking the PCT: experiencing the pain and joys of a solo venture into the wilderness. A truly exceptional story about rediscovering one's values through the physical and emotional challenges of an outdoor experience.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Had avoided this novel as it didn't seem to be up my alley, but after another friend insisted, I downloaded it. It starts off like a romantic comedy,you can picture the characters and New York, and like a film, the sugary sweetness a very enjoyable read with plenty of plot twists and turns. I didn't expect many of the twists, loved that the characters were complex, lved the red herrings. The ending was a surprise and I coudn't put it down while I tried to stay a step  ahead of the plot. Dark, foul language, a bit of escapism, very entertaining
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love having the option to just download the video if my speed is currently to slow for streaming. Or Downloading shows or movies on wifi at home for later viewing. :-)
B0053O89RY|5.0|This show is the most hilarious sitcom I have ever seen.  My husband and I laugh so hard everytime we watch an episode.  When I have a bad day at work - I, like others, watch an episode of this so I can laugh.  Always works.  I love Cam and Mitchell and really all the cast are Super Duper Funny!  I can't wait to buy Season 3 and watch Season 4.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|how old was the person that wrote this? ive struggled through one dimensional characters, bad story lines and even worse sex/bdsm or whatever the author wants to call it. Its written like a horny 15yo, with no real depth of anything, characters, or otherwise. the fact that the authors imagination could only come up with names like steele and grey etc is just as bad. i love my books, infact have hundreds, this is one of the worst ive ever had the stupidity of purchasing, actually no, it is the worst. Unless the author has grown in talent, i wont be purchasing the next ones,its torture reading this, for the others, id have to find myself a 'riding crop' to hit myself with!!![[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Book description: Children of the Corn with a splash of sci-fi.  Lots of twists and turns and wondering what the hell was going to happen next. A nice wild ride throughout the book.<br /><br />I thought the book was very well written and the story line kept my interest. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I think most people will really get caught up in the mystery of this story.<br /><br />Will definately check out more books from this author.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I'll admit, the theatrical trailer made this movie seem exciting and worthwhile, however, the actual movie experience was a major let down. The film itself seemed to drag on without a deep plot to justify the additional length. It felt like the film could have ended 30 to 45 minutes sooner than it did with the second half of the film being a chore just to get through. Additionally, while I thought Kristen Stewart would show some improved acting outside of the Twilight series, this film proved to me once again that she is a C- actress at best. There's a scene near the end of the film where Stewart gives an impassioned plea to rally the troops for a final battle. However, her poor acting skills were only magnified by this scene with Stewart being so overly dramatic to the point where it was just ridiculous. In fact, several people in the theater actually busted out in laughter during this scene. I'm sure the director did multiple cuts of this scene and if this was the best they could get out of Stewart then she has no hope of ever becoming an elite actress.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I am so glad Amazon is finally giving away a decent app from a wonderful developer!<br /><br />You have got to get this game! They constantly update with new levels to keep it fresh, and you just gotta love those birds!<br /><br />People that are complaining that it isn't truly ad-free...the ads you're seeing ONLY show up when you restart a level send are only for Angry Birds products. No ads appear during gameplay whatsoever, so I don't get what you're complaints are about!<br /><br />The updates have yet to wipe out my game progress, too.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was the most interesting book I've read in a long time. My husband even read it! Needless to say we \\"borrowed\\" a few pages!!!! Great reading!
0062068415|5.0|I had to make sure I read this before seeing the film and I'm happy I did. I don't get the chance to read books as much as I'd like but I'm making more of an effort this year and this story held my attention all three days it took me to complete. I'm afraid of giving anything away, but if you're looking for compelling, grab you at the throat writing, you've found it on Shutter Island. I will watch the film this weekend, it better not disappoint.
034580404X|5.0|Ive only read book one.....so far!! Other family members have read all 3 and told me it just gets better with each book. They told me book 2 is about his shaded past. They said book 3 tell about where there relationship goes. I guess I won't know till I finish the rest. It's a good read so far. Give it a try I'm sure you will enjoy it.
0553582038|3.0|This book is just a filler and doesn't include all the characters you want to read about.  The only chapters worth reading are Cercei's and Jaimie's.  Cercei is pretty wicked in the first 3 books, but in this one you see her in all her glory.  SHE IS EVIL!<br />Jaimie doesn't have a great reputation in the first 3 books, but in this one...well, I won't tell you.  All i can say is that he might be one of my favorite characters at the moment.<br />This book is long and boring most of the time, I will be honest.<br />I say...skip this book.<br />Go from the 3rd straight to the 5th.  The only real thing you will miss from not reading the 4th book is some interesting history.  If you decide to skip A Feast for Crows, check out the wiki for it and learn all you can about it so that you're not missing anything important.  If you do skip this book and happen to finish the 5th book by the time GRRM releases the 6th (which you probably will), then I suggest you read the 4th book.  Like i said, it's just filler, but it's a whole new book to get sunk into, even if most of the chapters are dull (cough*cough*Samwell*cough).<br />I rated the first 3 books 5 stars, even though I didn't review them, in my heart, they are 5 stars.  I am also listening to them on audio book with Roy Dotrice.  I think Roy was even bored with A Feast for Crows...<br />Well, that's my opinion of the 4th book.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This is a new thing I guess deleate progress for new levels I congratulate Rovio for this breaking discovery. Look its a good game but they must dealt want us to play the first world over and over again. REALY GOOD FOR REPLY VALUE TO! (like this for last two updates on this game and normal Angry Birds) -slow claps-<br />  P.S. where is the mighty space eagle?
034580404X|3.0|I would have liked a little more consistency with Ana's personality. Either she was terrified or she was rebelling.  When she did \\"rebel\\" she was supposedly terrified of the consequences, but she was really turned on by the thought of being punished.  An example would be when she was wearing the dress that was too short and she ran to the elevator and then felt like she should change because he didn't approve of it.  I also thought the sex every five minutes was getting to the point of ridiculous, especially when he was supposedly walking around with an erection and no one notices.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that even if you aren't used to watching gritty movies, you'll still enjoy it as a movie that captures your heart. Every time I watch this movie I feel like I'm going through an emotional roller coaster watching Ree teach her younger siblings how to shoot a gun is such a fun and uplifting scene to where Ree is scared half to death by her Uncle Teardrop trying to ask him to help her find his brother, her father Jessup. This movie is a masterpiece and a masterpiece that is also really true to the novel that it's based on. Jennifer Lawrence should've won the Oscar for her performance in this film! She carries this film beautifully.
B0084YSYW0|5.0|I'm pretty sure this is the book I picked up new in Scotland for about $20. Left it on the plane. Why is it so much here?
B00479SVBU|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars for both the company selling it, and the product.  There is ONE minor issue, but first the good...<br /><br />My use for the [[ASIN:B00479SVBU Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players (iPod, Zune, Sansa) with Remote Control]] is to use it as an SD Card player in my truck, which only has a single CD player.  I'm not going to use it as an FM transmitter as many apparently do.  It works perfectly for that as well as a USB Flash Drive stick.  I've tried both, but prefer the SD Card as it takes up less room.<br /><br />The 1st one I rec'd, however, wouldn't recognize the remote control, which utilizes several functions that the unit itself can't do without the remote.  Based on the reviews I read here, I decided to contact Satechi directly through Amazon, and within 90 minutes, I was advised that another unit was being sent to me at no charge, and that a PPD label would be included to return the defective unit.  I got it promptly, and it all worked, remote and all.  5 Star Customer Service without question.<br /><br />Now, the ONE complaint I have is that the mounting system for the unit is a little too \\"fixed\\":  Because it plugs in to your 12v and is fixed permanently on the plug, it's very difficult to adjust it so the screen is facing you.  I drive a 2010 Dodge Ram, and the 12v is in a little storage bin on the center console.  To use the unit, I have to have it turned horizontally with the Auxillary port facing up to plug that in to my indash radio.  It would be nice if there was an extension between the unit and the 12v plug that allowed you to swivel, extend, and tilt the unit itself so you could see it more clearly as well as keep it out of the way.  Several 12v mounted accessories have that option, and it would be great if Satechi added it to this otherwise perfect little unit.

0767834739|5.0|We love all of the movies in the Resident Evil series and are big zombie movie fans. Resident Evil is definitely our favorite in the Zombie movie genre of films.<br /><br />We had this DVD and broke it during a move so I needed to replace it. I purchased a new one and it arrived quickly to our home and in perfect condition.
B007NZDES0|5.0|... AWE. ... I missed the concert and I just to hoped to see what went on by checking the DVD. And, I am blown away. ... she grew into a beautiful self-confident woman. Her \\"NO ORDINARY LOVE\\" still makes me tear up. Soooo much soul - soooo much heart. But, it looks like she found a great team to make a big production of it. Great show. She should be mentioned on professional levels of SEAL and STING. ... I will share with friends as often as I can. BEAUTIFUL & AMAZING.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|After watching a few live youtube clips I was excited to hear the real cd but much to my dismay as few others have said the sonic quality is just not there.  I really can't see why this would be done intentionally because to me a cd is to mimic what a live performance would sound like.  This cd sounds like an old cassette tape that's been left in a cheap kraco car audio deck for 2 years and played every day.  Very disappointed.  Would have given this at least 4 stars if not for the quality.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|I loved the movie and the chemistry between all of the characters. I loved the music score, the scenery, the direction,the acting etc. I was enchanted by it. I saw it in the movie theater, watch it when it comes on TV and plan to buy the DVD. I wish more movies held themselves to the standard of this movie not burdened down with nudity and foul language. I could concentrate on the story itself.  I also hope that Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp will costar in a future movie that is as good as this one. I think they have something on screen for movie goers. I do think this movie is in the vein of a good Cary Grant movie with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. Congratulations to everyone involved in this film and who love it, too!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm ALWAYS on the lookout for a great new author and this did NOT disappoint!  When I first started reading this, I thought \\"a little slow paced - where are the battles, why is this guy reminiscing?\\" Flashbacks don't sit too well with me.  Right away I found I was wrong, wrong, WRONG about this being boring, slow or plotless.<br />The writing is awesome. I couldn't find a boring spot in the entire book. Within the first 15 pages, I wanted to know more, LOTS MORE, about this man and his story.  He was a prisoner (giving nothing away, since it says so within the first few pages, no worries) and a killer. At first I thought he must be the bad guy, but found out quickly that I had to keep reading and find out what was going on because if he was the bad guy, I guess I was going to LOVE the bad guy in this story!  There is enough told in the story to keep you very engaged, but holds enough back to make it near impossible to find a stopping point so I could get some sleep at night! Before I was halfway through the book, I was thinking about where I could find the second book in the series. With each character introduced, and there ARE many, you never lose track of the main character, never forget who is who and where their place is in the story, always want to find out more about them - and this is a rare trait when there are many various characters in a book.  Enough politics so you understand the thinking behind the rulers, but not enough to bore you - and I hate stories that have too much politicians in them!  Even a touch of \\"love\\" for the softy in us, but not so much that it can be rated as a love story by any definition of the term.  Battles, a hint of magic, great characters (which include animals!), wonderful engaging writing - add it all up and you have a \\"can't put it down\\" book.  I am hunting for the next book as I sit here writing this, my very first review.  Never wanted to take the time to write one before, but if you like this genre - you MUST READ THIS BOOK!<br />HAVE FUN Y'ALL!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the books before I saw the movie, so I knew what was going on... but I think it might be confusing for anyone who hasn't had that perspective into Katniss's head.  I did feel like there were some key scenes missing, but overall the feeling of the book was captured pretty well.  I bought it because I will definitely watch it again, but as usual the book was a LOT better.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have not seen such a good plot, and wonderful ensemble of actors in a long time. Full of humor, drama, and loads of Avenging action makes it one of the most brilliant superhero feature films to date. This movie is 5 stars all the way! No way a 1 star film.
B005LLX582|3.0|Whether or not you personally enjoyed this film, there is no arguing that it is a decent art film.  My favorite scenes were the natural history segments.  The audio was definitely a problem, however.  I understand the director's choice for using whispered narrations, but if you cannot hear the dialogue then the choice just does not work.  The theme was obvious and stated quite clearly: the brutality of nature versus the grace of the divine.  The father and mother represent these two extremes.  The plot was weak, but not necessarily integral for an art film.  The film seems to have been a prayer, if I understood it correctly.  A decent film, but even I found that it dragged on a bit.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I haven't seen a sci-fi movie that I really loved. The 3D was fantastic. I love the film, and hope for a sequel, and even more entries in the Alien/Predator universe. All in all, Prometheus is an instant classic. 5 stars, amazing film.
0525423656|2.0|It did not suck, but what was the point of this book? I am so sick of tired out trilogies that spend the entirety of the middle book with a quest and a love story that goes absolutely nowhere. I will read the next book, but only out of support for a Utah author. Trilogies suck.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|This movie is awesome. Blu ray makes this movie look really good in your hdtv.<br />In summary, it's a movie with great special effects, with lots of fun ideas.
0061726834|4.0|This is like the \\"Twilight\\" of YA dystopias. Yeah, the premise is kind of wonky, and yes, it's a book about love being a disease so of course it's going to be all \\"OH U BOY R MAI TWOO WUV 4EVA\\" but I loved it anyway.<br /><br />I thought Lena's character was kind of awkward, but I loved Hana and Alex. The book kind of rambles on for a hundred pages or so, but I was enjoying Oliver's writing so much I didn't mind.<br /><br />The ending almost killed me off. I am anxiously awaiting \\"Pandemonium.\\" Heh, heh.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The books were good, pretty predictable though.  I would like to know since I bought the books why I can not lend them.  If I had bought the printed copy I could give it to as many people as I want.  I do not think the author should have this right to limit what I can do with something I paid for.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This season starts out with a big bang - literally, as World War 1 breaks out.  The inclusion of the war scenes was awesome and they were spectacularly done.  As always, the acting is superb.  Characters you hated from season 1 will either redeem themselves and be less awful, or they become even more evil and you want them to die even more.  The storylines are even more compelling in season 2 and the Christmas episode will leave you on the most painfully awesome cliffhanger ever.  I can't wait for season 3 - bring on more Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith)!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It takes a lot to keep me interested and Lee Child did it for me. Finished the book and on to number two.

0385360185|5.0|I had never listened to a Romance novel before.  These books are definitely  erotic romances.  I found the audio CD'S  riveting.  The reader was not as good as I had hoped but she did a decent job.  Definitely not for the faint of heart.  Good thing I have a masters in Education with a specialization in health!  I would never recommend this for young adults.  Enjoying life at 72 and counting.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I admit I'm a Stephen King fan so I might be a little biased. But this book was a pleasant departure from the usual monsters and boogie man stories from Mr. King. It was a book that I found hard to put down.
0345803485|4.0|So far, this book is my favorite of the three.  Although a bit far-fetched at times, definitely kept my attention!
B003NTSBUG|3.0|scorsese : perfect. camerawork, cinematography, lighting, etc....all on point. it alot of aspects he borrowed very heavily from Hitchcock....very heavily. it worked to the movies favor.<br /><br />actors. dicaprio : love his acting but this was not his best by a long shot. weak boston accent and loads of overacting....that said im thinking its not his fault entirely because....and the reason for the three stars...<br /><br />that script : horrible. really weak story that completely rips off many, many movies before it. not gonna ruin it...but you will very very quickly figure out the mystery.<br /><br />this movie looks amazing but thats about it.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I found the Kindle Zip Sleeve very easy to use and it was not hard material but soft enough to protect the Kindle without it being damaged. I loved it.
B00846REIS|3.0|I like this book, however if you read this after you read Fifty Shades of Grey it is a complete rip off. I dont like how the sex is wham bam thank you ma'am in the very beginning of the book. Books should be fantasy yes, but we need some kind of reality. I mean if Gideon came on to me like that \\"Eva, I want to F you.\\" I would have slapped the hell out of him. Overall good book, I dont regret purchasing it. But I already read my Fifty Shades of effed up, I wanted something different this time.
0307454568|2.0|Walter Mitty is a fictional character created by James Thurber.  A dictionary definition of Walter Mitty is \\"an ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic daydreams of personal triumphs.\\"<br /><br />In reading this final book in the trilogy, I realized that the late author was living out a Walter Mitty fantasy through the character of his protagonist Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Mikael is a magazine editor and/or author, who turns into a James Bond-like action figure.  He publishes stories which shake the world and nearly bring down a government.  And women throw themselves at him.  He never flirts or makes passes at them.  Young women, older women, married women, bisexual women, pretty women, it doesn't matter, they are all inexplicably attracted to Mikael, who takes time out from investigative reporting to dispassionately satisfy their sexual needs without becoming emotionally entangled.  I lost my \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" about halfway through this final book, and the charm of the story was gone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I always heard about this show, but only recently got around to watching it. It took me a few episodes to get into it but once I was hooked I couldn't stop watching. This show is basically cowboys in space finally making cowboys look cool. It has a very similar world to Cowboy bebop. Would recommend to anyone.
0307949508|2.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was an entertaining murder-mystery with a few twists.  But there's no mystery in this book -- we know what happened and who was responsible -- and we are asked to believe that a Swedish magazine editor/author is James Bond.<br /><br />I almost didn't make it past the absurd preliminary hurricane story, which is completely unrelated to the other three books so don't mind this &lt;spoiler>.  Instead of returning the money to the police or victims, the Girl keeps it and pays for a boob job.  Then she commits statutory rape on a teenage boy.  Then a hurricane travels from the South Atlantic across the equator into the North Atlantic (which is all but impossible), and the patrons of an oceanfront resort seek shelter from the hurricane .... in the basement!  Even though a hurricane would cause the ocean to rise and those people in the basement would quickly drown.  This hurricane doesn't cause the ocean to rise, it's just really windy.<br /><br />In the third book, our hero expresses frustration in reading something where the writer got the facts wrong, and so he stopped reading it.  Well, that's almost what I did when reading this hurricane nonsense.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Usually a movie after the series isn't very good. This one was a rare exception. It is a little darker than the series, and honestly I liked the look of everything better in the show, but once I got into it I didn't even notice anymore. I like that the movie serves to wrap up the show very well, and yet still manages to make you tear up. It was a fitting end.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is how 50 shades SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN...<br /><br />Not once did I feel like I was reading a book written by a house wife who never finished high school, and at all times I was scorched by the passion and sexiness of this extremely well written story.  Brava.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|The Ultimate Santana meets and exceeds all expectations! The music takes you back a few years, but it is still amazing!
030758836X|3.0|I loved the first half of this novel/thriller - it's smart, well-written and the author does an outstanding job of switching from husband [Nick] to wife [Amy] giving  each a unique voice.  For the reader, allegiances switch back and forth depending on the POV [point of view] which  truly reveals a gifted  writer.  The way Nick's story unfolds in the present, often humorous, never dull, and Amy's story via  a diary which takes us backward to move us forward in time is ingenious and works very well. The reader can't wait until the two collide in the present. Unfortunately, the second half of the book is not nearly as well written and overflows with crude language. I'm not sure why the clever spot-on writing of the first part had to degenerate into cheesy, run of the mill writing all too typical of 21st century prose.  After the initial tension over what really happened starts to unfold, the novel, story and characters become increasingly difficult to enjoy.  Events don't illicit as much interest and lack believability.  The great character development in the first half falls victim to a messy game that simply doesn't ring true.  Ultimately, one doesn't like any of the characters and puzzles over what really motivates them.<br /><br />I wish the author had taken a different approach to resolving the tension of the story instead of getting lazy and making the characters sad caricatures. They were so much fun, intriguing even, in the beginning!
B0063IH60K|2.0|its okay but ive seen better. I do like the option to customize you background. didn't like the ad pop-ups.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This book should be mandatory reading for every person with allergies of any kind, and for every health care providers who treats allergies of any kind, even if you don't have a weight issue. It may seem heretical to eliminate wheat at first but it's worth trying if you have ever struggled with an assortment of allergies and vague symptoms. All you have to lose is aches, pains, poor health, low energy, etc, etc!

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book does not deserve all the hype it has been given<br />Dreadful story line, in fact no story more like it<br />Boring from beginning to end, I rushed through a lot of the pages<br />as it was just terrible to read.<br />As for the S/M i would have to say that this is worse i have every come across<br />and puts the whole S/M culture to shame.<br />Grey is so boring the sex does not even come across as good<br />As for the girl friend she is completely unbelieveable, and comes across as girl with no personality and no character,<br />She says nothing for young women, friendship or any thing else.<br />The end of the first book was terrible and was done in such away<br />that you were compelled to buy the second book or you were just left hanging<br />I think to call this lady a writter is a sham, She has done nothing for women in general<br />I just hope that this does not become a film as it will be the biggest box office flop of it time
B006LSZECO|1.0|Started out great, very aspirational then it turned incredibly dark and depressing. Based  on reading the summary I expected a good love story, not the case. I would not recommend this book.

Please watch them in order, and don't let anyone tell you anything about them at the water cooler. You don't have to be  familiar  with the old movies or books but it helps.  You WILL watch them over and over to see what you missed. You Will try to figure out each plot. But you can't....\\"NO ONE IS THAT CLEVER\\".....You'll got that later.  :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this, but take it from someone is in the real life BDSM community, instead of just reading about it, exploring it for yourself can be an invigorating experience...evil grin...come to the darkside...we have cookies...
B0084IHVC0|5.0|My two year old just loves the Aristocats blu ray and I do as well. Wouldn't mind if she watched it every day (which she has since buying it)! The music is wonderful and catchy... The picture just lovely. A really timeless tale about belonging and finding the way home.
034580404X|5.0|i really don't read unless i find a really good book. a friend of mine was reading 50 shades of grey and couldnt put it down. i figured id give it a try. i too, couldnt put it down. next thing i knew, i finished all three books in a week and a half.
0307744434|2.0|The book description made this book sound as though it would have a lot of action with dueling magicians and all. Overall, I found it to be much more boring. I finished the Night Circus, so it wasn't terrible, just not the typical book I would choose... I enjoy books that have a lot going on.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i like this app. it is very useful and helps me to plan the spending time witn my Kindle Fire. I recommend it. great for a free app.
0062073508|4.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book I read and it was really good.  I don't typically enjoy modern mysteries, so I was hesitant to try a classic one... but as in most cases, classic books are winners.  This book was a winner.  The ending was not predictable and I love that.
0739432176|5.0|I was really impressed with the time it took to receive my book as well as the condition. The book was better than I thought it would be and it looked perfect. It was well packaged so there was no damage. I have been very happy with this seller.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|really great free app. lots of choices and you can combine them to create your own sounds. love the different rain options.
1936608898|5.0|Yesterday was Day 30 of my first Whole 30, the eating plan outlined in It Starts with Food. I timed my 30 days to end the day before school began, so I could celebrate the end of the \\"diet\\" with the start of the school year. A month ago I looked forward to the reward of pizza and beer. Tonight, I ate a spinach, ham, and egg scramble followed by some blueberries for desert.<br /><br />My treat at the end of my first Whole 30 is instead the first day of my second Whole 30. Oh, and I lost 17 pounds. And I learned to drink my coffee black with no added fats or unhealthy sweeteners. And I feel both more energetic and more relaxed. And I'm free from those ice cream and sweets cravings I couldn't even shake after a multi-year low-carb lifestyle (a wagon I fell off years ago and could never successfully get back on).<br /><br />I've tried enough diets to know every plan has more failures than successes. YMMV, but I found this plan simple to follow, satisfying, and easy to adopt.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This games is amazing. It is also addicting. You should totally get this game. But just letting you no its a little different from the apple one.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|this book had it all mystery, history,horror,love and all woven together<br />very well can hardly wait for the nextone to come out feel like i know all<br />the 'people' in this book!
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Only turned onto MK's music a few years ago.  I had just listened to a live version of \\"The Bug\\" and loved it.  I was ordering strings the other day and needed a bit more for free shipping and picked up this CD.  If you like good music,  with melody,... and a GREAT bassist (Illsley) you will not be disappointed.  MK is always at his best.  Love the diversity in their music.  Best CD I have bought in YEARS....
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Sound is amazing on these headphones. Very clear, very analytical sound. Cannot find headphones with equal sound quality for the same price. Mine broke after a couple years, but I bought another as the other brands could not compete. Only thing is they are closed ear, and can hurt your ears if wearing glasses and wearing the headphones for long periods. But I bought these for the sound quality.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is just like minecraft but awesome in its own way because this game is awesome!!!!  I have minecraft on my ipod but I always play this on my kindle
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I found this book VERY informative, Mike doesn't just teach you how to plan a diet and training regime, he goes even deeper and explains what happens at a cellular level! His detail is also shown in the chapter of definitions, which other authors would not even bother with! I found it helpful and it completely changed the way I thought about training and diet! Also, Mike is very approachable and he insists that you email him with any qns. I found this also helpful, if I have any questions about my training I shoot him an email and by the next day I'v got a reply! You'll be doing yourself a favour by reading this book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|When it's working it's great! But sometimes when I try to log in, I get a blank white screen. I would give it 5 stars if that were fixed!
B004529NKC|2.0|I am a high school dance teacher and have watched virtually every dance film ever created. This movie is boring and predictable. At least Step Up 1 drew me into the characters. The dancing is good, not great in Step Up 3. What really bothers me about current dance movies is the constant editing. You never get a sense of the artistry of the dance, it is just a jumbled blur. Look back at Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly if you really want to see fabulous FULL length UNEDITED dance sequences. This movie was a total yawn.......
B007SGM084|1.0|While, the subject matter of this book intrigued me to a degree I eventually became bored with the whole mess.  Things that would have been a clever and unique way to spin something became so overused they were laughable.  The whole \\"inner goddess\\" thing began to make me dread her appearance.  And, I am pretty sure doing a double back flip off the balance beam is impossible for an inner goddess as well as most outer ones.  And really, can people have that much sex?  Repeatedly?  Sex on every page was overdoing it especially when you consider I have the page setting on my Kindle magnified up, therefore I am assuming sex on every page for me was sex 3 times a page for everyone else.  I honestly \\"Googled\\" this author because I expected to see a pre-hormonal 13 year old at work.  In essence, this book fell way short of the hype for me.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|In this dystopian world state, the people in power live in a culture rife with gluttony of the soul. They have an insatiable appetite (hunger) for whatever suits their fancy, power over others being one of the favorite cuisines with which they gorge themselves. It's a disturbing film in this regard, but is wonderfully told.
0307744434|5.0|This is my new favorite book!  I like it so much I am trying to design a tattoo to cover my right leg (Alice in Wonderland pin-up girls cover my left leg.)  I love Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games, Fifty Shades of Grey, and of course Alice in Wonderland is one of my most favoritest books ever, but I must say that Night Circus is the new favorite.  I haven't enjoyed a book so much since I first read Alice in Wonderland!I cannot even put into words how amazing this book was.  I guess I could use amazing, magical, and mesmerizing; however those just don't do this book justice.  I have never wanted a book to be more real than the Night Circus.  I want to go there, and explore each tent.  I want the chocolate mice, and light a candle on the Wishing Tree.  The description of the circus and each of the characters are so in depth and descriptive that I not only wish they were real, I feel bereft without them in my life.  The book is set up with perspectives from many different characters and the book spans over many years.  It also has chapters devoted to telling you what you are actually seeing while you walk through the circus. I literally felt at moments that I was there, excited looking at the sights of each tent, or anxiously awaiting the sun to set so I could enter the circus.  I don't see how a movie could possibly be anywhere near as good as this story (as movies often are not), however I will be first in line to see it.  I just finished the book, but feel the strong urge to start it again, RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor (and everyone else you know) and go buy this now.<br />See more of my reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com
B0090EIILU|1.0|Right up there with Space Truckers!  BOOOOOO!  :(  I cannot think of the last time I had to fast forward through a movie and STILL did not finish it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  It did get a bit boring in the middle as the author bounces between the husband's story and the wife's, but keep reading as it will all make sense soon enough.  I'm not sure I loved the ending, but I certianly enjoyed finding out the truth and realizing just how twisted some people are.  Ultimately it was all tied together nicely.  Enjoy!
034580404X|5.0|Fast shipping and great buy
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Arrived on time. Has been the best case I have ever bought. I would recommend it to anyone who has trouble keeping their phone clean from make up, dirt, and food.
1469984202|5.0|The book kept me interested from the beginning till the last page, wanting more ...  I want to know what happened next, I see many possibilities for sequels eventhough I dislike the series.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|Amazon says that it is compatible, it isn't. back to angry birds free from Google play. at least that version works even if it does have ads.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I would highly recommend this app. It is very User friendly...I like the graphics and the information is helpful. G.D.
B00785P2QC|4.0|a decently fun game. invest point should be easier to get though. they a little on the slow an hard side to get.<br /><br />still a likeable game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this to a Kindle Fire for my child.  It gets played alot, with no problems, great eye hand coordination game.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|My daughter brought the first part of the MAZE RUNNER home from school and had to do Q & A on it. The school year ended before they got through the whole book. She was so upset and enjoyed the book so much that I bought the whole series. I have since read the entire series as well and enjoyed them. They truly keep you sitting at the edge of your seat. The last series that had my daughter this willing to keep reading was THE HUNGER GAMES!
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal. I am glad that I watched it. I hope there will be more stories out there that reflect the true love that some women share. I believe in true love and think this film represented that. Well done...  I will definitely watch this again.<br /><br />Stacey aka Coffey Brown<br />LGBTQ Author

B005LAIGN2|5.0|Considering how this movie has been treated, I would say there are still some clear issues (numbers don't lie: Just look at the distribution of ratings compared to other WWII movies on Imbd and it's better than some movies that rate better...).<br />So, my full support to this effort. I was not aware of this until I saw the movie and the facts check so based on a true story of a battle on 2 front (Nazi and race).<br />Some of it is a bit surreal (how the guys who don't like them, likes them quite fast). The German guy is a bit comical in a B-rated way, but the rest is quite appealing and I went to check the facts. Thumbs up for the effort.<br />I got a great quote from the movie: \\"The art of politics is to postpone an issue until it becomes irrelevant\\".<br />Boy, is that a bulls eye or what!
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I bought John Locke's \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!\\" book on the recommendation of a regularly published ghostwriter/editor/author. As I have published a series of children's short stories, with several more on the way soon, I was an eager customer. As an indie author selling short stories on Amazon, I know the struggle to make it more than a trickle.<br /><br />In buying Locke's book I thought, \\"I have a decent Twitter/Facebook following, plus a website, blogs, etc. I'm in as good of a position as anyone. All I need are a few smart tips. Locke's made it, so why not me?\\" I knew that becoming a bestselling author might be difficult, but this is America. The playing field is level, isn't it?<br /><br />As I read Locke's book, I read a few logical, good sense ideas, like publishing books in fairly quick succession. Let each feed off the other's success. Sure. Good idea. There you go. I spoiled the book's value for you.<br /><br />However, a slow unease crept in. Locke's numbers seemed too unlikely. I thought hopefully, that John Locke was among those owning the goodness of all people, that, doggonit, he was one of those \\"right place, right time, everything just worked magnificently\\" authors. Locke, with his hard work, honest ways, and pluck, with the help of some kind passerby, managed the impossible -- to rise of from literary rags to bestselling riches. Then, I read he purchased reviews. He was no Horatio Alger.<br /><br />You see, I know Amazon very well. As a reviewer with 800+ reviews since the late 1990s, I know well the reviewing side and scams indie authors have tried. You name it: I've been bribed, threatened, flattered and even sued (Google me and the word lawsuit -- it was a big deal). But never have I sold my reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />This book is filled with a paragraph of truth. The rest is suspect. Myself, I no longer believe a word Locke says. If I could return the book as a lemon, and get my money back, I would. I feel cheated, scammed, lied to, all with the salesman's grin facing me. Why, I would even trust a Kevin Trudeau book before I ever buy a John Locke book.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly do not recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />TreeFortBooks.comlied to, all with the salesman's grin facing me.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Better than some of the other previous seasons. Seems like they were more careful in writing this one.<br />I was entertained till the end and for each episodes.<br />The end seems more logical (not so much in the way than in the fact that it happens) and real than some previous ends...
B0042UEU8M|5.0|I just watched \\"The Lucky One\\" then \\"Charlie St Cloud\\" Efron's Performance was \\"Awesome\\"!! LOOKING forward to Seeing him in many More Films. He's A Wonderful Actor!! Very \\"Talented\\" Young Man!!
B0002DB0FO|4.0|Everwood is one of the best heartwarming tvseries out there. its emotinal and it gets to you.<br />plus there is a lot of comedy as well if like the comdey in these.
B009329Y30|5.0|I've read alot of \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" Novels and Watched All the Movies based on his Novels. And I haven't found one yet that I didn't Like!! Some of them end well,and some are Real Tear jerkers! This was a Good one I'd watch it again. \\"Awesome Performance By Efron\\"!! And Two Thumbs up to N.Sparks for the Story!!
1609611543|1.0|Before you can even get to the diet part of the book, you realize that the only people who could practice such a logistically impossible diet would be a person with a lot of idle time on their hands or a wealthy person who could afford to hire someone to weed out all of the wheat that they say we are exposed to.  Someday I hope someone will come up with a workable, practical, here's what you can eat at McDonalds, Wendy's or fill in the blank for the fast food company of choice, for those who don't have the luxury of time or convenience to constantly check the label or make up of what we eat on a daily basis.  This diet is impractical for most people and I was very disappointed.  I will be returning or selling this book back to Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is defiently the best game I have ever played on Amazon! It seems easy at first but then it starts to get more difficult. All in all, its amazing(:
0345803485|1.0|I finally gave in to all the hype surrounding this book and bought the paperback version. What a disappointment. I'm not at all surprised that there are so many bad reviews. It's poorly written and there's really no story to it. And as for the sex scenes, well these are just over the top and totally unconvincing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad I can finally get this game on my kindle! EVERYONE, YOU BETTER DOWNLOAD THIS! Best game ever(:
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|I refused to buy the lame non-3D version.  This version is pretty cool.  Best of all it worked with my Australian player and 3d TV just fine.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book was very interesting. It is an excellent way of understanding habits and ways to make changes for the better.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|What kind of mind thinks up a plot of adults expointing children to hunt and murder each other using food as the motivating factor, a disturbed one!<br /><br />I had not read the book and rented this flick based on the hype and advertisements for it EVEYWHERE. Donald Sutherland once again proves why he is not in many movies, he cant act.<br />The ending just, well sucks.. not leaving us wanting for more but wondering why we bothered.<br />If you have not rented it dont, wait for it to come out on HBO or one of the other premium movie channels and even then you will be disapointed that you wasted over 2 hours of your life watching this flick.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how this game gives me so many different options and all of them are completely different it really keeps u busy I recament this game to anyone who like fun games that arnt too hard yet not too easy either
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Just watched all of Firefly - I can't understand why this show didn't last more than 1 season on TV. Smart, witty, fast-paced writing; finely developed characters with interesting and mysterious back stories; spectacular adventure expertly choreographed with great special effects for the time. This show had it all. And it was hilarious. It has something for everyone, whether you're a science fiction fan, or a western fan, or an adventure fan, or mystery, comedy, and on and on. What the heezee Fox? \\"Serenity\\" is the movie released to tie up any loose ends left when the show ended, and the it was fantastic too. Any fan of great television/story telling should watch this tragic treasure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far its pretty fun and its a good way to kill the time and no issues as of yet.
B00422LESO|1.0|Im a total dork when it comes to the books I read. And im an Austen fan, so the book seemed promising.<br /><br />But this book wasnt good at all. The romance didnt seem real, the characters were never fully explained so I couldnt relate, and the choices the people made were, childish. Its really hard for me to not like a romantic novel, and Ive read a lot of bad ones, but this was baaad really bad.<br /><br />If you like your romances to be superficial and weak, go for it. You may like it
B0042RJWTM|3.0|The movie was just okay. Lee Marvin seemed just a bit too old for the part.<br />I liked the Tom Seleck version much more. But neither followed the book very well if at all.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Had this app even for my old palm pre where it played smoothly. For my gs3, this free app is terribly buggy and crashes frequently. Severely disappointed in both Rovio and the Amazon Appstore for allowing such shoddiness. Also, compatible android devices should be listed.<br /><br />Bought the ad-free version. No more problems. Must be Angry Birds' way of getting you to purchase!
B004ZISVWC|5.0|This is a MUST SEE movie, that's all you need to know. If you are looking for a geat movie to see right now, just choose this one, YOU WON'T REGRET it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|If you has bought high quality headphones probably you will need it, you can rise the volume but with limit, without this amplifier. Then if you use this thing, with a portatil music player like an iPhone or MP3 the music becomes a pleasure. Very good purchase
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really. fun game. I love it a lot.it is a lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot of FUN!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app - appealing format and good quality. The percentage calculation feature also makes for even easier use. And it's free!
B00004YW6I|4.0|I like this CD. Received it in a timely manner. There was nothing wrong with the CD itself, but the case was cracked. Nothing to get upset over though.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book. I felt it was slow moving and I really wanted it to go into more detail about Kennedy. Sadly disappointed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great book for any 80's 90's geek, specially for gamers. Every page have at least 2 references to a game or 80's show
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Every time I watch this horse run on You Tube, I get the chills. This movie is the first one that I have watched in a long time. It is a feel good movie that the whole family can watch together. No nudity. No violence. No filthy language. No special effect explosions.  Just a beautiful story about a magnificant horse and a woman who was derided as being \\"just a housewife\\" who had faith that her horse had what it takes to be a winner. Of course, everyone knows the story of Secretariat but that does not diminish the enjoyment I got from this film. Some witty dialog ... as Secretariat was winning the Belmont by 31 lengths the trainer implored the jockey not to fall off.(A sad prophecy in that Ron Turcott was later involved in a fall that injured his spine and ended his career) My only complaint about the movie is that there could be so much more footage of the horse and its early training. The movie had barely begun and Secretariat was already being entered in the two year old races and was suddenly horse of the year. Then, it ended right after the Belmont rather than continuing through the end of the year to when he was retired to stud. Overall, however, a well done movie that I could recommend to anyone.
B009329ZF2|5.0|The story has a few twists that contribute to great action story.  Battleship is the right name for this movie.  The aliens were conceived in a  new way and the point of \\"just what in the world do we expect to happen if we contact alien worlds\\" is given an interesting answer.  Watch it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the most cutest games that I have ever played. My friends and I play it all the time when we are bored. I have never played a game where it was as simple to play as this one.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun game, haven't played it in a while, heard there are several new levels, figured I'd check it out. Fun as ever.<br /><br />But as a Free App of the Day? A successful game like this doesn't seem like something that would a a FAOTD. Dunno. Seems weird. Oh well :p
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I guess I kept my expectations fairly low, because I thought this movie was so funny, I watched it 2 more times before my rental time was up.  I urge everyone who loves comedy to rent!!!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Slammed is a debut novel by Colleen Hoover, and I really wanted to love it. I'm having a hard time rating it because I liked it, but I guess, I was not emotionally invested it in. The writing was very addictive; I just could not put it down, and had to know what happened next. When I finished reading it, I was satisfied with it rather than abso-freaking-lutey lovin it.<br /><br />  The story is about dealing with grief, accepting reality, and moving on with life. Layken aka Lake moves to Michigan after her father's death with her mother and younger brother. Will lives across the street from Lake, and has an instant attraction towards her. Their romance was too fast yet completely believable. I've seen or read their type of story so many times that I was not excited about this one. One thing that did work for me were the secondary characters. I just loved Eddie, and I wanted her to be my best friend. She is such a refreshing character, and I loved reading her parts in the book.<br /><br />  The highlight of the story was slam poetry. I didn't even know what it was, but when I read Blue Sweater, I was completely blown away. Now, I'm not a poetry fan, so it was shocking to realize that I loved it every single one of the slams. Just for that, I'll read the next book. It's not that I didn't enjoy it; Slammed was a really good read, and I would definitely recommend it. It's just that I didn't feel the main character's emotions that much, and was not really connected to them. I'll read the next book in the series in hopes that it will be better than this one, and we'll get to know more about them as a couple.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|Ordered the Blu Ray of a movie that I really enjoyed. Locks up at the climax of the movie and even after repeated efforts to trouble shoot, no luck. Find another vendor.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a pot boiler for women who are sex-starved and titillated by the thought of sexual sado-masochism.  The ending is entirely predictable, though I can't understand why she didn't keep the Red Audi.<br />Guys, pick up a Popular Mechanics or something by Lee Child.  This is not for you.
0345803485|1.0|I am not going to waste energy thinking of witty ways to say how completely stupid this book is.  I had to give it one star because the system does not recognize \\"zero stars\\"
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is the type of game I wait for : not just hidden object,  but an excellent mystery game. I love the fact that it is difficult,  yet the graphics and story line make you just want to try and figure it out. I have,  however,  had major issues with it freezing often,  and it shut down on a few occasions.  I even had gotten through a few rooms when I had to uninstall and reinstall. I have too much accomplished now,  and hope it keeps going okay. Even with all that,  it is such a good game,  I can 't stop playing. In league with The Lost City,  and The Mystery of Crimson Manor. JUST GOT THE UPDATE, AND IT WORKS FINE (so far..)Thank you. Love this game!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I didn't want to see this: I've seen too many zombie films. What is with the fascination with zombies anway? Or should I say, obsession? Anyway, this one is well done. Of course, it is a series, so they can stretch it out a bit and give more depth to the characters and the story.<br />In this we get to see the character's foibles. How they deal with them, with each other and with the...walking dead. We can feel for them and with them. I'm looking forward to the next season. I hope it carries on in the same direction. Some shows start out strong and then fall short of expectations. Lets see what happen with this one. All in all, a good tv series. The only real fault I have with the series is the stupidity that prevails among some of the characters, just like in real life. They leave a redneck survialist behind to save someone that is a weak link. Yeah-common sense. This is a definitely a series about natural selection. See which ones survive and which ones don't.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been 20 years since I enjoyed a work of science fiction this much. It's been so long since I had the feeling, glancing at the clock and seeing the late hour, throwing responsibility to the wind, and plunging on to read for hours longer. Made me feel like a kid again.<br /><br />Amazingly polished for a self published work. No offense, but would not be surprised to discover this was a secret pen name. Just so good. I wish Hugh the best!
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun game, kills time and uses your mind highly recommended. I hope they come out with more great games like this. keep up the good work
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game always keeps you entertained and willing to play all the time and the plus the variety of the games you'll enjoy
B006J420UE|5.0|I'm using this as a media center and to run a Minecraft Tekkit server. That's pretty intensive especially when a large number of people are on. It works great and has no issues keeping up even on the base clock speed.
0545265355|1.0|Very disappointing.  Unimaginative as sci-fi.  Very poor character development.  As a distopia nove, no exploration of issues of government, economics, the role of media--just complaints that all had gone wrong, but no reasons given.  As for literary value, forget about it.  This is just a teenage girl's boyfriend problem story.
B0088X7YU0|2.0|If you haven't already bought this movie, you should seriously consider waiting for it to come out on commercial TV. They'll cut all of the nudity out, but it's CGI animation, so no big loss there. To give the program its due, the storyline is not bad. The movie incorporates a lot of CGI action sequences that are fun to watch. In addition, there are a number of memorable characters, traditional (Rico, Ibanez and Karl) as well as new (Trig, Hero and Chou, among others). However, the CGI animation is way over-used. It seems like the director is attempting to meld live actors with the CGI animation. However, the attempt fails miserably, primarily because he uses CGI for everything. Sadly, the fact that he used neither real sets or real actors in non-CGI animated roles, makes the movie appear more like an online video game rather than a serious movie. Bottom line: as produced, this movie was very disappointing in spite of the fact that many of the characters had great potential.
B00325NM6E|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1TKBGKVKUL51Y]]One of many absolute edition reviews i made, largely so you can get a feel for the look of the book as well as its bonus features. my vids are mostly about the particular addition, with minimal critique of the story/art itself.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|Not only does the upgrade make you start all over, but it prompted me to pay - again - for the premium Danger Zone worlds. Please fix the versioning or device recognition so it can work as seamlessly as the iPhone/iPad version.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really enjoy this game.  Play is as fast as you want it and is interesting to play a spatial game instead of a lot of word games.
B008BRC6NS|5.0|Was great and much better than I thought and had alot of the old music I've forgot and great dance music.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm VERY impressed.  I love all of the other angry birds games but this is by far the BEST one yet.  My favorite level is red planet.  I don't know how rovio did this.  But all I know is that rovio did an AWESOME job!!!!  I advise you to get this game it's not a waste of your money!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very poorly written.  The dialog is sometimes difficult to follow & the characters are... shallow & fake are the only words that describe them.  Could totally put this book down & actually quit reading it half-way through.  It read like a 14 year old wrote it about what she imagined adults were like.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|It's a harmless summer action film that wasn't as horrible as the critics and dilettante cineastes would lead you to believe.  Some variation on the SETI Project has been trying to communicate with the Gliese 581 star system, and the response to those calls is a small invasion force that cordons off Hawaii in a force field to test our potential response to a full-scale invasion.  The aliens just happened to pick the time when the annual RIMPAC naval war games are being conducted, and although the vast majority of the US Pacific Fleet and several other nations are on the outside, it's ultimately up to the Aegis destroyer USS John Paul Jones and its screwup tactical action officer Alex Hopper to save the world after all the other ships trapped inside the force field and all of Hawaii's bases are summarily massacred in the first encounter.<br /><br />Its affiliation with [[ASIN:B004XV2U2I the board game]] is fleeting and 98% ancillary, and could've been left out altogether without anybody noticing: the only connections to it are that the invading aliens occasionally fire peg-shaped munitions, and the only time they call out the letter-number sequences when shooting is after cobbling together a fire control method by overlaying NOAA map grids onto the tsunami warning buoy network because the aliens' ships don't appear on radar and the aliens themselves are so light-sensitive that they have to wear welder's masks in normal sunlight.  It's no [[ASIN:B00005N5S3 Midway]] but it was nice to have a sea-based war movie pop up for once.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Brilliant work. Ties together all the loose threads and leaves you hanging out for the next book in the series.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the game is fun but it has a few bugs other than that its really fun [...] thank you p.s game is fun
0345803485|4.0|I had to buy this book to see what all the hype was about. Let me just say,\\"wow\\"! It was very detailed which was very nice. I found that I could not put the book down at all. Immediately I found it to be somewhat similar to the Twilight books in the fact that it is some rich good looking man who is \\"dark\\" and a very low self-esteemed young lady who becomes obsessed with him knowing his secret. There were many things like others have said with repeating phrases. This got on my nerve a bit but not enough to ruin the book. I also would like to note that it has made life with my husband a little more interesting! I say a great read and be prepared for a little \\"cheesiness\\".
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very nice enjoyable game that makes time management very easy and entertaining. definitely recommend this game if your ever bored or want to try something intriguing to some level.  very fun. Keep it as a app an use it when bored.
0345803485|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. It has a great story line and superb writing. There is a lot of sex which makes the book even more interesting:)<br />This is a MUST read.
B001I10ABO|3.0|I was excited at the thought of owning this album on vinyl, but on first spin it skipped left, right, & centre.<br /><br />If you're putting it into a frame, buy it. If you plan on listening to the album front to back without skips and pops...don't.
B001USHRCK|5.0|this modular is a must have for all lego fans. although the price is pretty steep, the beauty of the building and the satisfaction you get while building it more than make up for it. highly recommended.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|This is not a bad \\"movie\\" the problem is that it's just a story within the universe.  There is no real \\"bigger picture\\" to this movie so it feels like a very long episode in a series rather than a standalone.  The beginning lags a bit for no apparent reason except to show naked cartoon women.  In a cartoon movie it's kind of a cheesy thing to do but in anime they apparently do it a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise it's decently done.  I own the other 3 and don't have a problem with any of them, I probably won't buy this one.  Worth a rental if you can stand animated movies (the cgi kind not the hand drawn style).  The animation is really well done, it's just nothing new story-wise or graphically.<br /><br />3.3 stars...better than average worse than pretty good.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Justin Timberlake....'Nough said!
030758836X|2.0|Without ruining the book for anyone who still wants to read it, I would like to give this one a thumbs down. The beginning is amazing, edge of your seat, wanting more kind of book - what a psycho-thriller, crime novel should be. And the use of foul language puts you on a more personal level with the characters. However - the ending - it leaves you quite disappointed. Not only does the storyline become lifeless, the writing style and diction begins to deteriorate. I read a review calling the book \\"Toxically Brilliant\\" and I would say the beginning yes but the end is not even worth finishing. I prefer the Tana French novels for a true crime thriller with excellent writing style and amazing twists and turns.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Okay, let's face it. Playing Angry Birds with all those annoying pop-up ads is FRUSTERATING! This was a really great F.A.O.T.D. considering there already is a free version. The free version has the ads, though. I would definitely recommend this version of Angry Birds, if you're looking into it while it's the F.A.O.T.D.

B004LWZW4M|4.0|The movie was in great condition although the cover photo looked as if it might be a fake. All together this movie is one of my favorites and I am satisfied with the product.
B000J103OI|3.0|Whilst the book was much better, the film was good although the sound quality could have been better. Meryl Streep as usual gave a good job, ditto Anne Hathaway.
1609611543|1.0|I did not like the book at all. It seems  to be based on the writer's private opinion and very selective research; backed up by the author's profession ( cardiologists are not necessary wheat experts).

030758836X|3.0|This was a good read and I found it hard to put down...mostly because I was appalled at the characters behavior.<br />The last 20% of the book and the ending was quite disappointing.  Worth reading, but not sure I will read any more of her books. The character was not likeable (but was not supposed to be) - no redeeming qualities to the book after the first 80%.

I am Not Happy, with how I have to wait for the rest of the books to come out! NO where... does it say, that this is just the 1st book!! I can't find No date for the next one called Deeper In You...to come out! So now I have to sit and wait ;(  If I knew this, before I got it. I would have waited for all of them.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In true Stephen King fashion this book had me hooked from the first. Ive been a King fan for years and I'm still amazed at his seemingly limitless imagination. 11/22/63 is a fascinating trip through the past and a jaunt down memory lane for those readers who grew up during this time period. I found myself longing to travel back myself to a period before computers, internet and electronic gadgetry. I did have a hard time trying NOT to read into the underlying political views that I'm not sure are just a fabrication of the story line or perhaps a bit of Kings own personal beliefs. Either way this book is a must read and one you will have a hard time putting down if you are a Stephen King fan.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I won't go into details describing the point of Angry Birds, odds are if you have an Android device - you already know about this game and how it works. What you may not have known, is that even the Free version can be made ad-free by simply turning on Airplane mode (or rooting your device and installing some software).<br /><br />My biggest issue is that this so called \\"Ad-Free\\" version still has advertisements for other Rovio titles and even Angry Birds merchandise! These ads can be seen when the game is paused or during level select.<br />While paused, you can disable the ads by touching the pig mailman, but this has to be done every time you restart the app. Very annoying.<br />The advertisements you see while selecting levels are always there and can't be turned off.<br />This is just false advertisement here. Rovio, I don't think you guys quite grasp the concept of Ad-Free.<br /><br />My second biggest issue with this FAOTD version is that while it does feature the new Surf and Turf levels, it does NOT contain any of the power ups that the Free or HD titles have. I have no idea how or why this happened. Apparently the Free and the more expensive (HD) variants take priority over this one.<br /><br />My final concern is the network permissions this game requires. While not as vile as the Free version (which requires a lot of permissions), I still don't want this supposedly Ad-Free, single player game to have network permissions.<br /><br />Other than the problems I mentioned, Angry Birds (Ad-Free) is a great game and one that every member of your family can enjoy. The graphics and sound are all top notch, and the entertainment value is huge.<br /><br />As a FAOTD, it is the best thing we have had in a long time.<br />Even as a paid game, priced at only $.99 it's a steal.<br />There are a lot of levels to get through here and if they ever put in power ups I will bump up the score to four stars.<br />If all the advertisements (and network permission that is theresolely for them) are removed, I will be bumping this up to a perfect five!
B005LAIHHC|5.0|The funniest part of this movie (for me, anyway) was the presence of Ben Kingsley, who plays his role utterly straight-faced. I'm sure he was completely aware of how absurd every aspect of this movie was, but to watch him, you'd think he had no idea. In a film that is filled with comedic actors doing outrageous things, Kingsley is strutting around, dignified, serious, and stern of feature, delivering his lines as if he's taking part in a Shakespearean play. It's great to see such a respected actor having fun with the roles he selects, and willing to take on something different for him, impervious to the fear that many critics and fans might lambast him for the decision.<br /><br />John C. Reilly also has an incredible performance- I felt his lines were the funniest of the movie. Unfortunately, his role is quite brief, but it's great to see these two heavyweights (Reilly and Cohen) from \\"Talledega Nights\\" reunited and having such a good time together. (And keep your eyes peeled for a non-speaking cameo by Ed Norton late in the film.)<br /><br />If you don't like Cohen's humor, or any of his previous movies, you surely will not like this one. But for his fans, it's another delightful trip into the absurdity and hilarity that he's become well known for. What sets him apart from other outrageous actors is that his humor is always remarkably on point with its satire (sometimes subtle, oftentimes overt) of politics and society.

B005I6EVUG|1.0|I love the look of this cover, but was disappointed once I actually put it on my device. While I was playing with it in the store it snapped close with a magnet, which I liked, however once I got it home I found out that the magnets are actually only in the packaging. So once the cardboard inserts from the packaging were removed there was no longer a secure magnet closure and nothing keeping the front flap closed at all. Additionally, the straps at all 4 points that hold the device in place really stretch to their max and don't seem like they will hold up very well. One of the straps covered the power button on my device which caused it to turn off and on randomly if jostled even slightly. For the price of the case I really expected more. I will be returning it on my next trip to the store.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the beginning to end, this book had me at the edge of my seat. One hand holding the book open, the other hand reaching for my underwear drawer in case I needed a change. Some of those--ALL of the 'intimate' scenarios were extremely hot. Funny enough, when I first heard about the book, and from Wendy Williams no less, she said it was \\"mommy porn.\\" She described it as women who were dominatrices. Or at least that is what I gathered from what she was saying. I finally decided to buy this book and give it the once over. I've been engrossed in sci-fi for the last year and it was time for a change. Oh,my! Ana Steele is a strong female character with a \\"Bella Swan\\" weakness to her. She has that whole, \\"he's beautiful and too good for me but I'll never listen and do everything I can to sabotage our relationship\\" thing going for her. Christian Grey. Well, he just makes me forget I'm a Christian. The way E. L. James portrays this character, the sex appeal and vulnerability just oozes from the pages. I can almost see this man when I'm reading. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh and dirty secret. haha. You never know when Christian is going to break out the silk tie, and where you'll be reading when he does. I was in church the first time. Don't worry. I prayed extra hard for forgiveness. But I couldn't wait to get home to read some more. ;)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The adaption from book to movie was very accurate, although some parts were left out. Considering the the length the parts left out were not pertinent in conveying the story accurately. Now that I have a visual to the charactes they did a great job chosing the actors. Can't wait to for Catching fire to come out.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Combining the best elements of \\"24\\" with more developed, realistic dramatic situations and richer characters, Fox's Showtime series HOMELAND ranks as one of the finest television programs in recent years. Grandly compelling and brilliantly performed, \\"Homeland\\" - over the course of its 12 first-season episodes - profiles an an American POW (Damian Lewis) who returns home to the U.S. as a hero, but whose reappearance causes upheaval within the family he left behind and, more importantly, draws suspicions from a troubled CIA agent (Claire Danes) who believes he may have been turned while in captivity.<br /><br />\\"24\\" producer Howard Gordon, along with Alex Gansa, developed this reportedly loose adaptation of an Israeli TV series and, after the project was sold to cable outlet Showtime, went about differentiating \\"Homeland\\" from the weekly adventures of Jack Bauer. This included an obvious upping of the ante in terms of sexual content and language, as well as making Danes' Carrie Mathison anything but a Bauer clone. Instead, Carrie's dogged pursuit of the truth is contrasted with her bi-polar disorder, which threatens not only her health but jeopardizes her job with the CIA. Her constant questioning of what she witnesses is amplified by her own self-doubts about her mental health, adding to the already powerful dramatic impact of the series.<br /><br />Danes has rightly been praised (and has already earned a Golden Globe with a possible Emmy on the horizon) for her performance here, and she's backed up by equally impressive work from Lewis, whose often placid exterior houses a turbulent, possibly villainous force within. His Nicholas Brody struggles to readjust to his wife (the lovely Morena Baccarin) and two children, while mysteriously vanishing to practice Islam outside of their view - but is his new faith the result of a spiritual reawakening that occurred while he was in captivity, or the fallout from Al Qaeda brainwashing? Brody's main motives are slowly unraveled throughout the first season, culminating in a fever pitch of tension and suspense in the season finale. Mandy Patinkin, meanwhile, is also outstanding as Carrie's father-figure boss, who tries to reconcile her brilliant methodology with a turbulent personal life that he hides from his superiors at the agency.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how entertaining, suspenseful, intelligent and compelling \\"Homeland\\" is - and now that the series is on Blu-Ray, there's no reason to miss it.<br /><br />Fox's three-disc BD set includes the first season of \\"Homeland\\" in excellent 1080p AVC encoded transfers with 5.1 DTS MA soundtracks. Extras include deleted scenes, commentary on the pilot and a half-hour behind-the-scenes featurette, plus an extended storyline integrated into the episodes. There's also a four-minute teaser from Season 2, which debuts later this month on Showtime.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can you believe that the s&m sex gets monotonous?  These people have sex every day, all day and night long.  They are never tired, or sore, or \\"not in the mood\\".  And there are only so many descriptive words for the act, and the body parts involved.  So that gets monotonous too.  However, if you read all 3 books, there is a storyline that ties the books together, and by the end, the character definition and development comes together too.

0374532281|2.0|I don't know what others see in this book.<br /><br />The story is repetitious. Here's what happens: Pat works out EAGLES NIKKI EAGLES, Tiffany follows him on his runs EAGLES NIKKI EAGLES, they don't say anything NIKKI EAGLES NIKKI, Pat goes to therapy EAGLES EAGLES NIKKI. Repeat. At the very end this spell is broken and loose ends are tied up. But they weren't compelling loose ends anyway. And they were fairly predictable, too. I didn't see all of them coming (Kenny G), but most of them were obvious. Some things were never explained--Tiffany's interest in the dance competition, for example.<br /><br />There were so many things I couldn't stand--the narrator's style is juvenile and frustrating. It's clear he's modeled after Holden Caulfield, but that's pretty cheap. Not to mention ineffective. He's a 35-year-old man and yet he wears his limited experience with stereotypical inner-city black culture as a badge of honor. He was a teacher, but he can't understand why The Adventures of Huck Finn would be taught in school because it has multiple uses of the n-word. Pat is mentally ill, yes, but does that mean he's incapable of having a complex thought?<br /><br />The narrator and his family are Eagles fans. If you're going to read this book, prepare to read the phrase \\"E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!\\" at least 500 times. There was also the curious and unresolved matter of the father's devotion to the team. His whole life revolved around them, and much time was spent discussing the father and his reactions to the games, but it was for nothing.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of the premise. The book is supposed to be a journal, and he's writing the journal for one reason. When that reason is gone, the text somehow continues.<br /><br />It's not all terrible. Tiffany is a good character. Or rather--she would be a good character if we knew anything about her until the last few pages. Pat, in true Holden Caulfield style, genuinely loves children and is sympathetic to them. The endingmakes good on the promise of silver linings.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I watched the trailer for the movie. It looks like they've changed quite a bit to make Pat and Tiffany more compelling. A two-hour movie where the leads don't speak to each other for the first hour and 55 minutes certainly wouldn't do.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|look past the camp and you will see one of the great movies.  great acting, directing and quite possibly one of the greatest scripts ever written-\\"a maharaja strangled himself with her stocking.\\"

B000HEWEJO|5.0|IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is my favorite Christmas film.  My other three (3) are: BAD SANTA, A CHRISTMAS CAROL (ALASTAIR SIM version) and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION ...so I have my mix of funny and tear-jerkers.  IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is not only one of my favorite Christmas movies, but it's one of my favorite films period due to it's central message i.e. No One Is Born In Vain!!  I watch it every Christmas ...and I get choked-up every Christmas when I watch it.<br /><br />All of us, in our lives, experience downtimes, despressing times, hardtimes where like George Bailey (played perfectly by Jimmy Stewart aka the common man) think things and the people in our lives would be better-off if he weren't around i.e. if he were never born.  This film illustrates that no matter how bad things get e.g. foreclosure (the possibility of), prison (the possibility of), death (in the family) that things will get better.  It's just we cannot quit.  We just have to keep on fighting and not let negativity grip us and bring us down into the darkness where we expect bad things to happen, therefore pushing us to be fulfillers of our own negative prophecies.<br /><br />We all go about our day, just like George Bailey performing, what we perceive to be little things, kind gestures. This movie powerfully shows-us the impact these \\"little things\\", these gestures have on so people ...and if we were never around the terrible void it would leave in other people's lives.  It also shows the tremendous chain reaction life's moments have on other moments, and how these moments affect so many people ...people we are not even cognizant of in our own lives. Such as, if George never lived his brother Peter would have died an early death because George would have not been around to save him which consequently would have caused Peter's military regiment to die in war because Peter Bailey wouldn't have been around to save them.<br /><br />We all have purpose!  Many times, it feels as though \\"Nothing ever goes right for me!\\" or \\"Everybody hates me/you!\\" or \\"There isn't meaning to anything I am doing!\\".  But, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE powerfully depicts there is reason for us being here, and if we were not here an \\"awful hole\\" would exist.<br /><br />SIDENOTE: This movie should ONLY be in Black & White.  There are versions out there that have this movie in color ...such versions are blasphemy!!

0439023521|4.0|So I'm late with the whole Hunger Games obsession, I realize that, but I have to agree with the majority of people out there and say this is one fun book. It was a highly addictive read that had me turning pages at full speed.<br />Katniss is a great protagonist. She's someone I really felt at ease with, someone I understood, which is one of the huge issues I usually have with YA books: I pretty much always dislike the female protagonist. But Katniss is a force of nature, with cunning and strength that makes her one of my favorites of the genre. Peeta is also fun, although he can get a little frustrating, and Haymitch, since he resembles Katniss in personality so much, is another that loved.<br />But of course, the plot here is king. The whole idea of the book, although not wholly original (Stephen King's The Long Walk is a predecessor with an even more compelling cast of characters), is clever enough to keep us all guessing and wanting more. Some things, like the muttations at the very end, felt a bit contrived and the book would have been better without it, but on the whole, this is a fascinating book.<br />Now I'm off to start the second one!
B0058YPGSY|4.0|Motorcycle gangs.  Shoot outs.  Tough guys.  Rock 'n roll.  This is a MAN'S show, correct?  No soapy stuff here.  Not correct.  This is through and through a SOAP OPERA, disguised with the leather jackets and tough guys.  Don't get me wrong - this is an excellent show.  It is definitely captivating, the acting is great, and it is NON-STOP drama and action.  As far as one of the best shows EVER?  I think some people are getting ahead of themselves.<br /><br />The thing that really separates the epitome of excellent television (The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad) from very good television (Sons of Anarchy, for example), is the fact that in the first types of shows, people don't really change.  This mimics real life, where people generally remain relatively the same over long periods of time once they reach a certain age.  Of course people can do complete 180s in their lives and change, but at the core....people generally remain the same.  EXCELLENT television is generally a little slow moving in character development, since in real life people don't change from day to day.  These shows don't rely on cheap thrills and love triangles and constant jaw-dropping character changes and motives.  They have to rely on...wait for this....great writing.<br /><br />Enter Sons of Anarchy.  It is one of the biggest rollercoaster emotional ride experience on television, with people and their motives CONSTANTLY changing and evolving from episode to episode.  People get kidnapped, everyone is a liar and a backstabber, and one minute something is a crucial element to the plot, and the next it's dropped/forgiven/forgotten.  The writers are masters at creating drama and non-stop action, but as far as realistic portrayals of human beings (something that the show is trying to achieve - make us empathize with these characters), this gets a 4/10.  They are the show that relies on cheap thrills and twists to make a show.  Does it make it bad?  Not necessarily.  Not every show is made to be in the ranks of shows like The Sopranos.  Kurt Sutter has commented that all of the excess, ridiculous, over-the-top drama is purposeful and for good television.  This is quite probable, but is it an excuse or the truth?  With the way some of the characters act (Gemma in particular), I believe that the show is trying to make me feel like this show is more than just constant drama and twists, but something more deep and meaningful.  And I'm not feeling it.<br /><br />The acting is really great, there is no denying that.  I'm still not convinced that I buy Ron Perlman (Clay) as tough biker, but I've come to deal with it.  This is a very Clay-focused season.  Katey Sagal as Gemma is wonderful as always, and is absolutely superb with the material she is given.  My only problem with her character is that sometimes the writers push the \\"matriarch\\" card a little too hard.  Ever see the end of Mystic River, where the wife gives Sean Penn that \\"king\\" speech?  Every time Gemma talks it sort of reminds me of that, and it's a little annoying after 4 seasons.  Also, Maggie Siff as Tara Knowles continues to bore the hell out of me, and it's been obvious since season 1 that they are setting her up to become the new \\"matriarch\\" of the club.  Predictable/cliche, much?<br /><br />I also still can't forgive the sudden drop of Wendy (Drea de Mateo) in season 2.  In season 1 she is living with Jax and there is a major storyline between Gemma/Tara/Wendy, and in the next season Wendy completely dropped off the face of the earth along with the storyline, and then she returns this season.....?  Disjointed storylines like this are never signs of excellent television.  Her character was inconvenient for the growth of Tara/Jax, so they just dropped her.  Lazy writing.<br /><br />Charlie Hunnam is an amazing actor (can you believe he is a British stage actor?) and totally convincing for his role.  Everyone else is very good - I love Kim Coates, Mark Boone Junior, Theo Rossi, Tommy Flanagan, andprobably my favorite - Dayton Callie as Wayne Unser.  He was terrific in Deadwood, and equally great in this show.  The show still has a total obsession with using Deadwood characters - over 13 to date, but that's a great thing and they make a great addition to the show.  This season we're joined by Ray McKinnon, another Deadwood actor (the Reverend!) as Assistant U.S. Attorney, Lincoln Potter, and as usual, this guy is just amazingly weird and a terrific addition to the cast.<br /><br />SoA is not lacking in drama or great acting, but I think a more slow-paced show (somewhat like the first season) would do it justice and make it a little less silly and a little more gritty.  I definitely recommend this show to anyone though that is interested in a high-action, intense, dramatic show with lots of twists, turns, extremely sappy moments and great acting performances.  Even with the all of the criticism I gave it, it's still easily in the top 10 best dramas currently on television, hence the high rating.

B00913DPW2|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Very challenging and addictive.  The puzzles were tricky but not impossible.  did have a few bugs but an update later seemed to resolve the issues.  I also strongly suggest putting the jigsaw puzzle together as you collect the pieces otherwise they stack on top of each other and it's harder to spread the pieced out. Overall very pleased! !!!

0711986746|5.0|Having grown up on Queen's music in the 70's, I was intrigued when watching the life of Freddie Mercury on the Biography channel. I began to research more about him since my best friend had just lost his battle with AIDS.  My search brought me to this book which I purchased and read. I literally read the book in two nights. Peter's unabridged accounts of both Freddie the entertainer and Freddie the very private person leaves nothing to the imagination. To me this was a wonderful thing. To be able to read about Freddie, his temper, his desires, his strive for perfection, his true loyalty to his small hand full of true friends, his real love for Mary, and his brave struggle in the end.<br /><br />I have now had the wonderful fortune to meet and become friends with Peter. I have also read his second book, \\"The Afterlife\\" which discusses the months and years following Freddie's death.<br /><br />Each book holds true that \\"life is short and we are not all perfect.\\" Freddie lived his life to the fullest and finally found his perfection in the form of Montserrat Cabelle.

0553801473|5.0|The 4,000 pages of Martin's first 4 books have created such robust short-term and long-term historical contexts of his world that by Book 5, I know most of the characters and the political, cultural, social and religious issues driving them, as well as their respective foibles and strengths well enough to know how they should or might act, but not so well that I know how they will act or deal with the challenges they face.  It's like keeping up with what a quirky group of friends I've know all my life are doing; I interpret their behavior against my familiarity with the past, but they always surprise me.<br />The pacing is fantastic, so I never spent too much time with any one character or set of characters.  Just as I got updated with one character or story-line, WHAM, he's moved onto another.<br />And it's amazing how he spins out characters into separate story lines, only to have them integrate back into the core narrative.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|R2F were formed in 1972 with 2 core members represented here in Chick Corea (piano & keyboards) and Stanley Clarke (electric and acoustic bass). Drummer Lenny White joined the band in 1973. Throughout the following years the lineup changed with Corea and Clarke always in place. Each did their own thing as well. White left in 1977 but returned for good in 1983. Guitarist Frank Gambale and violinist Jean-Luc Ponte joined the group in 2010.<br /><br />Early on their version of fusion-jazz appealed to many fans including this one. Hell, I still have a couple 8-Track recordings in a drawer. Ponte's addition is a good move. His jazz fiddle shares the lead on several long pieces on this excellent 2 disc live session. The 2 discs contain 9 tracks with an average length of 12 1/2 minutes giving proper showcasing of each member of the quintet. I was especially impressed by Stanley Jordon's work on the stand-up bass. Gambale is an excellent guitarist and works well with Corea in sharing the lead. White keeps everyone on time and adds a piece to the song collection.<br /><br />This package includes a 3rd disc which is a DVD in Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Included on the DVD is a 64 minute documentary featuring the group speaking about each of the songs selected for the album. It also has an 8+ minute sneak peak at a movie trailer called \\"The \\"Story of Return to Forever.\\" It includes 2 slightly blurry video performances (\\"After the Cosmic Rain\\" and \\"The Romantic Warrior\\") performed in full in front of an appreciative live audience. Fans of the band and those who are unfamiliar should check out one of the most influential groups in musical history. They still have it.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|An amazing debut album - great beats and even better lyrics.  The future for Mr. Ocean is bright! Lost, Bad Religion, Pyramids and Pink Matter are my faves
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I thought this was a dreadful read! Very badly written. I found it very degrading for women and the characters frustrating &  annoying. The hype around this book has been unbelievable and I can only assume that if 'older women' are raving about it that it will be a curiosity and fascination for the explicit sex and darkness written in it? The storyline is predictable and repetitive - the reader knows that each chapter will probably be a 'variation of the same theme'.  I have ave been told books 2 & 3 are better but I will not be reading them - each to their own as they say.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was a little taken back by the first book, but as i got into the second book I looked forward to continue<br />reading until I finished the third.<br />this lady is a marvelous writer.knows how to capture your attention, and makes for a wonderful read.<br />look forward to any future books she brings forth.<br />teriffic read.
B004FECNIO|4.0|I really love this movie. I watched it at the movies when it originally came out. I decided to add it to my collection recently so I purchased it. Problem is that it doesn't really appear to be bluray quality. Not a bad picture at all but I was expecting a little better.
0307949508|5.0|Okay, I cheated.  I didn't read book one...now I wish I had.  I was afraid of it because it was a translation--it would have been my first--and all my friends said it was so hard to read.<br /><br />But after watching the movie about twenty times, I just couldn't resist any longer.<br /><br />And thank god I didn't.  This book was amazing, and I can't recommend it higher.  Salander is a pip, a truly unique character, and one of my all time favorites.

1608871045|4.0|This is good book with a lot of info and features about Nolan's Batman Series. Can see a lot of efforts were put to come out this book. Due to unique features and design of the contents of the book, extra care is needed to handle this book from packing and reading this book. Recommended for those who like Nolan's Batman Series and the art of it.
0307454568|5.0|After reading this book, I have to dissagree.  The computer is not the greatest invention ever.  This novel proves that the written word is the greatest invention ever...closely followed by the book, and then the novel.

B00913DPW2|2.0|The graphics are beautifully done. The game itself, and the puzzles are fun and challenging. However, the game froze on my of KF...inside the house...two entryways with one to the utility room. I had to reset the game at this point, and then it froze in the same spot again! I like the game, so now I'm very frustrated ...I would have easily given this game 5 stars if I could finish it!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I saw the preview for this book's movie and decided to read it. It was really good. I thought the characters were easy to relate to for me, who never really fit in during high school. I never expected the ending but it was good in the way it helped make Charlie more understandable. The letter format makes it easy to read as well.
B0060MYNBY|5.0|AS ONE OF THE ONLY CLEAN SHOWS LEFT ON TV, THIS SHOW IS EXCELLENT!!! YES, IT CAN BE LACK LUSTER, IT CAN BE TOTALLY OFF OF THE REAL STORY OF ARTHUR AND MERLIN.....BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT???? IT'S ENTERTAINING, FUNNY, DRAMATIC IN IT'S OWN WAY!! AS LONG AS THIS SHOW IS ON, RELEASED TO DVD, I WILL SUPPORT IT!!!!!

B0000793ZC|4.0|The SM double album \\"Live In the City of Light\\" is a great feast for those persons who were really into \\"New Gold Dream\\", \\"Sparkle In the Rain\\", and especially the then recent \\"Once Upon A Time\\" releases.  If you're a fan of much of their first three releases then there might not be much here that you like.  Otherwise, these live discs present a stadium friendly SM with big, expansive, reverberating sounds and Jim Kerr's soaring, hopeful vocals and is a tasty but not necessary treat.<br /><br />But the caution above is for anyone who might be buying from a third party as I did.  Whomever I bought this from thought that the CD (volume 2 in this case) was the total package, or they didn't care.  Either way I only got half of what I ordered.  With this particular product it might just be best for the buyer to purchase from Amazon themselves.  I had owned this long ago on cassette when it first came out, now I own half of the concert on CD.  4 stars for the CD and 1 star for the service.  Buyer be warned.
1451627297|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books EVER! It really made me think. I really wish it will be made into a movie. It's a really long book,but no wasted words, and a book that I was grateful was long because it was so good. In a couple of years I'll probobly reread it.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|TNG was my first Star Trek. Since then I have gone back and watched each series - some were better than others, but I was able to find something to enjoy about all of them.<br /><br />This movie continues along those lines. It isn't perfect, but the acting was very good and the characters were enjoyable. (Simon Pegg &lt;3 - may you be given a larger part in the next film)<br /><br />I actually really liked the reboot aspect. Alternate timelines have long been a Star Trek tradition and each series has at least one episode focusing on the concept.<br /><br />It has the faster paced, larger than life feel of a modern movie but with the same heart and spirit of the TV series. All in all well worth a watch or two.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|These three movies are a must for any movie collector.  All three are very good to excellent movies guaranteed to entertain.  Good for a \\"Girls Only Weekend\\", or just watching with your significant other or just all by yourself!! Music is great as well.  You will not be disappointed.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|\\"Battleship\\" is a crappy film, coated with pretty frosting and sprinkles of special effects.  The ONLY good thing about the film is the special effects/action scenes.<br /><br />The first 40 mins have NO aliens...just lame/boring character development. Battleship looks/feels exactly like a Michael Bay film.<br /><br />When the aliens do attack, the rest of the film is practically, non-stop action, with dumb plot-points and cliched characters. And there is a stupid plot-point where veterans are asked to help command the Missouri.<br /><br />The aliens themselves...well, their suits are kind of neat (kinda like a cross between, Master Chief and a scuba-diver), but the creatures look like rednecks from space.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is in the film, but does nothing. Rhianna is pretty, but her character is bland.<br /><br />I still dont understand why the aliens throw people around, when they should just try killing them with weapons.<br /><br />Another thing im confused about is why an alien doesnt kill one of the humans, because the human is wearing glasses...<br /><br />And yes, there is a grid sequence, similiar to the boardgame.<br /><br />While Battleship is nice to look at, the story/characters are just stupid.<br /><br />Watch it, if youre bored, but thats all i can recommend.<br /><br />Battleship sinks with 2 stars

B0010X745K|1.0|The whole thing takes place in a sleepy little New England town in Maine (big shock there for all you King fans, isn't it?) Anyway, there is a big thunderstorm and following it this strange mist appears. The mist spreads and something in it starts attacking and killing people. The main character David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son along with various other townspeople end up holed up in the local supermarket trying to survive.<br /><br />From here it your basic horror movie/end of the world type stuff. Some people put their big boy pants on and try to come up with plans and others go crazy. Some people die. There is Mist and creatures and fighting and all the way up until the last 15 minutes I would have given this flick 3 or 4 stars. Yes the monsters and characters were a little cheesy but I can appreciate that in the right setting.<br /><br />Then it gets to the final act and I find myself wishing I could delete this abomination from my brain. The ending is terrible. Stop watching when they get in the car and imagine your own ending. Seriously.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW....<br /><br />The master plan is drive until they run out of gas. So they drive... and drive... and drive... and then see this HUGE FREAKING THING with like deer legs but it's like as tall as a mountain. I mean it's HUGE and it kind of steals their hope of getting out of the mist, but they drive on anyway.<br /><br />Then the car sputteres and dies. The gas is all gone. Uh-oh. Do we wait until something comes after us? Do we wait until we are hungry or thirsty? Do we let the one person who doesn't have a bullet to eat get out and try to push the car a little while, maybe until we find a gas station or another car or something? Do we try and make a run for it or seek shelter?<br /><br />No, phoey on using logic. The car ran out of gas so with a single nod Drayton decides in that 10 seconds to off everyone- including his own kid. Try hesiating for a minute. Come on. No one who just spent two days trying to protect their kid just shoots him ten seconds after the car runs out of gas. I mean I know the point is that he promised his son not to let the monsters get him, but really. It only takes a second to pull the trigger why not wait until it was the absolute last second. There are ways to give the impression of passing time in films - USE THEM.<br /><br />Now outside the care we see flashes and hear four bangs, as well as a thunderous sound coming closer. Then back to Drayton who is screaming and trying to eat the gun, only to hear empty clicks. He gets out of the car and is all 'COME AND GET ME! AHHHH!' and the rumbling grows. Is it a monster?<br /><br />NO. It's an army of tanks and trucks and guys with flame throwers, which by some trick of deafness Drayton and the others in the car couldn't hear or see even though they appeared like ten seconds after he got out of the car and the mist vanished in about twenty seconds.<br /><br />So to sum up, Drayton murdered four people for no reason at all. He falls to his knees screaming.<br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />Now, maybe if I wasn't a King fan this ending wouldn't have made me quite so angry, but as things are I felt cheated and betrayed. If you read King you know that while tons of people die and loads of messed up stiff happens his books still manage to end with a lighter feeling. There are always those lucky few from the core cast that pull through and make it out alive. For example Dreamcatcher, Rose Madder, Gerald's Game, The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon, Lisey's Story, Cujo, It... I think you get my point.<br /><br />What's that you say, Drayton surives? I 'm sorry but I hardly call being a man who murdered his son for no reason being someone who has survived. He's never going to be right after that I don't care what you say and that is no kind of life at all.<br /><br />I haven't read The Mist, but I simply couldn't believe that King would give us that ending, so I looked it up and low and behold I was right. King ends with them driving and Drayton beliving that he heard single word from a radio broadcast through the static, meaning that there was somewhere outside the mist and closes with his whispering two words to his son, two words that sounded the same to him. 'Hartford and Hope' That is a King ending.<br /><br />Don't me wrong I can appreciate a well done tragedy. This isn't one.ght. King ends with them driving and Drayton beliving that he heard single word from a radio broadcast through the static, meaning that there was somewhere outside the mist and closes with his whispering two words to his son, two words that sounded the same to him.

B009329Y30|2.0|I wasn't the lucky one since I actually rented this and watched it online.  Zac Efron is believable as the leading man, but the leading lady wasn't his match.  She looked too old and wasn't attractive enough to play the love interest of such a handsome leading man.  The story was cheesy and predictable.  The sex scenes looked awkward and I didn't see any chemistry between the lead actors.  Efron's acting at times was as weird as Kirsten Stewart's acting in all of the Twilight movies. \\"The Lucky One\\" will appeal to hopeless romantics who enjoy a love story no matter what.  I wanted to know more about Zac Efron's character and see more of the bayou culture...so many scenes with the dogs!!!

B00000JRTX|2.0|This is the film that did it for me.  The story is so good, so darn clever, and I find Hugh Grant's performance utterly charming.  But Andie MacDowell spoiled this entire film for me.  Most pick on the final scene where she utters the film's last line as confirmation of her bad acting, but I think the problem existed long before.  It is just that she was so conspicuously bad in that particular scene.  You couldn't ignore it.  She absolutely shattered the mood, so I was picking off glass, and I could hear groans.  Her voice was so bizarre, it was like someone farted during a period of reverence.  Before watching this film, I had no opinion about Andie MacDowell, but afterwards, I concede I developed a definite animus.  I'm forgiving with actors - as long as they don't ruin the story or are at least entertaining, I really don't care.  I mean neither Jackie Chan or Jean-Claude Van Damme can act, but at least they have some modicum of credibility.  I can't say that about Andie MacDowell.  She ruined this entire film for me.  I realized she could not emote during the scene when she was recounting her lovers.  She was the star, the focus was on her.  You could see Hugh Grant's obvious distress, but her face was as blank as a plate.  No inflection.  No nothing.  Even her voice didn't sound natural.  I didn't believe a word she said.  If the producers had brought on someone who was at least human, or someone who could speak in more than a robotic voice, then this film would have been stellar.  Andie MacDowell was good in sex, lies and videotape, because the character was stiff, frigid and emotionally stunted, but she hasn't been able to duplicate that caliber of performance (or her just being herself).  Surprisingly, Andie MacDowell was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this role.  The Golden Globes have lost all credibility, and I have no doubt it would nominate a shoe sole if it can nominate Ms. MacDowell.  The film could be good, but it was utterly ruined by Andie MacDowell, so I can't recommend it unless one wants to see how bad an actress she is.  What I mourn is the loss of potential.  This could have been a great film - only if she was removed.  I would hire Andie MacDowell's agent in a heartbeat.  He could sell anything.

B004QL7K6G|3.0|If you've seen the previews you know the gist of the movie: Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd are a married couple who end up in a commune named Elysium, that may or may not be a nudist colony.  In and of itself that was enough to reel me in.  Ultimately, however, I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />As often happens in life, a couple - George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) - makes a mutual sacrifice by following the dreams of one and risking the lives of both.  George and Linda get in over their heads when her documentary pitch gets rejected and he gets fired, leaving them with no money to afford the recently purchased expensive, downtown NYC studio apartment.  Left with no choices, they pack up and move to Atlanta where George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a menial backup job.  On the way they search for a place to stay they end up at the aforementioned Elysium (I was hoping they'd find the motel from [[ASIN:B000RGN2JI Vacancy]]).  At Elysium they encounter an assortment of offbeat, outcast, and oddball who live their free-spirited way.  The experience at Elysium, and the soul-crushing life possibilities at Rick's house, is enough for George and Linda to question their current situation, their preoccupation with technology and industry, and contemplate a life-altering decision.  Sadly, Wayne (Joe Lo Trugilo) is quickly revealed as the only nudist of the group is, immediately tempering the excitement and anticipation of a possible Anniston or Malin Akerman uncovering.<br /><br />Speaking of Akerman, one of the strongest aspects of this movie is the combined cast.  Every bit player is someone who could carry a portion of a film in their own right.  Most are funny.  Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, Kathryn Hahn, Kerri Kenney, Lauren Ambrose, Michaela Watkins, and Todd Barry all bring something to the table.  Alan Alda, while up there in age, can still deliver in any role.<br /><br />Being a fan of raunchy comedy, I really thought I'd like the film more.  The script is predictable as can be, but it's easily dismissed for people who can shut off their brain for two hours.  I'm also a fan of Paul Rudd; his sarcastic delivery is hilarious.  Unfortunately this film didn't deliver nearly enough laughs, and disappointed me just like Couples Retreat.  One scene has Paul Rudd in front of a mirror, preparing for a tryst with Malin Akerman, and he's obviously adlibbing for an extended period of time.  It's painfully unfunny to watch.<br /><br />Verdict?  Not crude enough to win me over in a [[ASIN:B0010R08PO Superbad]] sort of way, and not heart-warming enough to convince me in a [[ASIN:B000MR1V22 Little Miss Sunshine]] kind of way, but good enough at each that I sort of enjoyed it.cript is predictable as can be, but it's easily dismissed for people who can shut off their brain for two hours.

B005C7SXMS|4.0|It's a short putt from here to a Wes Anderson movie, so if you like Anderson, this should do you just fine.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Fourteen year old Oliver Tate is in love with his classmate Jordana Bevan. Oliver's folks are having issues in their marriage and mom's old flame has moved in next door. Oliver feels compelled to get the girl and save his folks' marriage.<br /><br />This is a quirky flick. Oliver is young and too bright for his age so he comes off as kind of gorpy. Jordana seems nice enough but has a dark side and harbors issues regarding closeness and commitment. Of course Oliver only sees what he wants to see in her because he wants to get in her nickers. His mom seems normal enough but dad is an intellectual stick in the mud. Her old flame is way too into himself and his \\"New Age\\" guru travelling show, but he's more alive than dad. This film does much to give the viewer the sense of the craziness one experiences when coming of age. The awkwardness and missteps are all brought to the forefront.<br /><br />Again, this is a very quirky movie. It's set in Whales and sometimes the accents and Oliver's rapid fire delivery of a line kept me from getting everything, but I enjoyed it just the same. And this is only a happy-ish ending. You get the feeling that Oliver and Jordana, if they move into the future together, might not end up as the storybook happy couple. They both have issues to work on.<br /><br />This is director Richard Ayoade's first feature length film, but he seems to have already found a voice. This is so good I will easily look forward to seeing his next outing
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Everyone should have known that going in...this movie is about an alien invasion of all things! ...And how many times has that really happened? So if you're willing to suspend belief in regard to the basic premise of this film, by comparison, why should anything else in this movie seem all that \\"ridiculous\\"...to anyone? The fact that this movie never deviates from being: \\"purely for entertainment\\", is probably its greatest attribute, and that alone makes it worthy of a high rate. My wife and I both loved this film. We bought the blu-ray the minute it hit the street, and look forward to seeing it again...and again! It was fun, exciting, visually stunning, also some-what touching, and yes...it even rocked! Oh...and did I mention: It was FUN!

B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is very nice. Better quality than most clear TPU cases, as it is actually pretty clear. The hard plastic clear cases do NOT offer proper protection. TPU is a good shock absorbing material but still can have a slick finish so it doesn't attract dust and dirt. I put the screen protector mean for the front on the back (just cut out a bit for the camera) after reading reviews about the circles messing with the phone. I already had a Moshi ivisor in white which is AWESOME! Definitely worth the splurge on that one. I will update this review after a couple of weeks seeing how the case holds up<br /><br />****Update ***<br />I realized I forgot to update this. I found the case to be too bulky and uncomfortable due to the \\"sharp\\" edges. I gave it away to someone who ended up feeling the same way. I like a little more slim and smooth.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is a great album.  I found this one after loving the Mumford and Sons album and Amazon \\"suggested\\" this one.  I'm a fan or pretty much every genre of music except hard core rap and most country.  I love to just put this disk in my player while I'm driving home from work.  It allows me to relax and smile at the same time, all while stuck in traffic :).  It's a very affordable album and well worth the money.  If you are on the fence about buying it, don't hesitate...do it now and you won't be sorry.
1416972242|3.0|The Plot:<br />This continues City of Bones, which I read last December. As you can see from my review, I fell head over heels for City of Bones - plot, characters, and all. City of Ashes didn't produce quite that reaction from me. Don't get me wrong - it's a wonderful book. But I had (extremely) high expectations for this book. I figure: once the author has created the world and introduced us to some terrific characters, she can now experiment with and complicate the plot; in other words, it can only go up from there, right? Wrong!!<br /><br />This book focused mostly on how Jace and Clary were so attracted to each other and how terrible it was that they couldn't because they were siblings.  Boo hoo. I admit they are a super cute couple and I'm rooting for them, but I'm invested enough (yet) to be constantly reminded of their misery. It's like with Being Nikki, where I just can't stand how she's always complaining about her awful, luckless love life.<br /><br />There was always this undercurrent of unease throughout Downworld (not hard to guess... it's Valentine). He's getting ready to perform a ritual that could pretty much ruin the Clave's chances - a mysterious ritual that would make Valentine the master of all the monsters so he could easily defeat the Clave. The last 100 pages were the real gem. That's where the author crams in all the descriptive and engrossing action of the gigantic battle of good cs. evil. However, Valentine barely escapes. Again. I guess what I am trying to say is that I'm afraid the series is becoming formulaic. Excepting a few awesome twists, the storyline wasn't that much different from the first one.<br /><br />The Characters<br />In my last review, I said that I hoped Clary would grow as a character and become more independent. And she did! She now has these fantastic new powers - she can create new Runes! That may not seem like much, but considering she's used them to blow up a ship, I'm gonna say she's pretty darn powerful. She can finally stand on her own two feet. She's a lot better now than she was in the first one.<br />Jace has also gotten even stronger and more athletic than he was before. He also shows his vulnerable side more often, which definitely makes him very likable.<br />In the next book, I really want Clare to expand on 1) Isabelle and 2) Magnus Bane. Isabelle can't stay the perfect, gorgeous girl forever. She has to show another side soon... although I don't mind her being the enigma of the series ;)<br /><br />Narration/Tone<br />Overall, the author has an engaging writing style, but it wasn't quick, snappy, ever-witty like the first one was. One of my favorite things about City of Bones was how I could pick a random line from the book and it was likely to be a quotable quote. Not so with this one. There're definitely a lot of humorous writing going on, but not as much and not too memorable.<br /><br />Overall<br />I've heard the 4th and 5th books are wonderful, so I do plan on continuing this series, if only for the fact that they are so very popular (a movie's being filmed, for goodness sakes!)<br /><br />*I borrowed this book from the library to read and post an honest review.*finally stand on her own two feet.

B003AJKPL2|5.0|I was in the market for an olive pitter and discovered cherry pitters are the way to go. Easy enough. But then I started reading the reviews - not just for this one, but all pitters - and saw some pretty crazy comments about their quality or ease of use. I've had great luck with Cuisipro products in the past, so I took a chance on this one and am happy to say this is no exception! I got the pitter and found that it was so easy to use, from dropping the pit into the middle to pressing the lever/grip to extracting the olive. Plus, it was easy to clean. I highly recommend this product!

0385742886|3.0|The only references to the Maze Runner trilogy characters can be found in the Prologue and Epilogue of this book. Thats it! The story gives back ground on what happened to the earth - but doesn't answer the questions you'd expect from a prequel!  The story is 20% relationships 80% fighting zombies - well written and descriptive but too much fighting for me.  Maybe the prequel has a book 2 or 3 to give the readers what we were looking for.  OK book as a stand alone and hopefully it is a trilogy too!

B007G5K066|4.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a thinking person's spy movie. It isn't the flashy, fast-paced spy movie with an obvious plot like the typical James Bond story. It also doesn't have the overly-done special effects of the typical American-style action movie. Instead, what it lacks in speed and eye-candy it makes up for with classic who-did-it storytelling. It is the story of a British spy, forcibly retired under suspicious circumstances, being brought back in secret by the highest authorities to reel in a suspected mole in British Intelligence. You watch, you guess, you think.<br /><br />  Gary Oldman's George Smiley is a classic old-school detective in this tale. Based on the book of the same name by spy novel author John le Carr&egrave;, this spy story is more like a mix of Clue with Sherlock Holmes than the more common western-style spy story. Smiley follows the clues through thoroughly, trying to figure out which of his former colleagues is the guilty party. The only clue I will give is the guilty party was the most unexpected person at least to this reviewer; maybe you are better at guessing these things than I am. Smiley even has a spy within the agency working for him in secret, getting information to him at great personal risk. The story is great but it does develop slower than most people in this day and age probably would like.<br /><br />  The HD transfer and the cinematography itself are very good. In particular pay attention to the chessboard scenes- you will know them when you see them. The sound is very good too- at least given the type of movie this is.<br /><br />  In short, I would suggest any avid spy movie fan purchase this movie. If you are only a light fan of the espionage genre, you might wait until it comes down in price or perhaps rent it instead of buying it. If you are a hardcore spy fan, then you might consider reading the book and the several others that follow it in the series. I know it is now on my to-read list. I give this movie 4 stars- only taking one off because I know this movie may lose some appeal to people who like everything fast and obvious. I highly recommend it.ly taking one off because I know this movie may lose some appeal to people who like everything fast and obvious. I highly recommend it.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|i really enjoy this new CD and i believe you will too! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy
B000002J09|5.0|As an album it is more than a fat vehicle/plinth for \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" which ok is LedZep genius apex. Now I imagine there are ten zillion reviews of this album but the question is in 2012-has it lasted the distance. Answer: unequivocally, yes it has. It is a monster of sound that has many gems and not the one. Confession: at the time of this release, I loathed Led Zepplin. I thought they were a blues and progressive sell out. Selling their souls to fill enormous stadiums and trading on a few heavy metal/blues riffs and a vocalist who sounded like he gargled with cinders. I was wrong. In Auckland NZ, circa 1972 they played at an outdoor amphitheatre Western Springs. I had been stood up by a girl who was a big fan (but didn't go to this concert-go figure-I was 17 and I was left with two tickets to see a band I professed to loathe). I went, gave one ticket away at the gate and was blown to smithereens by the musicianship on display. Jimmy Page playing a double necked electric guitar with a violin bow and making music. It was staggering. So In have 2, 3 and 4 in my collection to this day and from time to time haul one out and they are good. Very good. So this whole album is a gem store full of goodness. The opening thumping \\"Black Dog\\", the sluggish bluesy \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". And people it does. The whimsy of \\"The Battle of Evermore and Going to California\\". OK \\"Stairway\\" still rocks. These lads were seriously good at doing the business. Its been 'motional.

The only reason I finished this book was to find out why Christian is the way he is...yet (spoiler alert yeah right)...the author doesn't tell us anything!  The sex scenes r laughable and some r nasty. The only parts that I enjoyed were the parts where anatalks of her inner goddess. I don't understand how the author has gotten so much credit for this book. I have read more enjoyable books than this and they don't have half the hype this is book has. Try laurell k. Hamilton. Her sex scenes are way more beleivable and her books don't end abruptly leaving u wandering \\"what the hell did i just read?\\"

B001VZY4M8|5.0|In 1971, I can remember writing to a London promoter (I think Robert Stigwood) to see when Neil Young was going to play in London. Alas, it was after I set sail (or in this case flew like a blue arsed fly) to the New World or in this case Auckland. But I had my vinyl copy of \\"After the Goldrush\\" to help me in myself imposed exile. Canada or NZ I was asked. I chose NZ-was that life? Well that is a different tale. But this album of Neil Young on release was big amongst certain pimply adolescents of boys trying to climb up a notch into manhood. See we liked the inner fold-out of Neil's so patched jeans there was more patch than jean. Cool or what? And the music...\\"Don't let it bring you down\\". Something the half throttled screech of post voice break could sing along with. Then the hard rock of \\"Southern Man\\"-what did we care there was a band somewhere in the deep south called Skinned Leonard who were building up a bottle of hate to let down on poor Neil's unsuspecting head. He was just telling it as he had read it. It was and still is, a gem of an album. Even the slick card sharp \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" like a wart on the butt of perfection was just a bit of Neil frippery to end on. There is a lot to like about Neil Young and a lot to breathe through the nose over. But you know, the man has delivered and this was one hell of a stake to put in the ground and lay claim to life after the gold rush. More Klondike anyone?

B002MFV2IK|5.0|This movie was a riot from the very beginning. It contains about every human emotion that ever existed. Jealousy, betrayal, regret, envy and revenge seeking. I've never had so much fun watching the back stabbing, hypocritical, undermining behavior that goes on from beginning to end.<br /><br />Meryl Streep (My favorite actress) again puts forth an award winning performance as a woman obsessed with staying young. Her distain for Bruce Willis, her husband, and he for her has them exchanging cutting remarks that will make you laugh out loud. Goldie Hawn, the woman scorned, comes back into their lives with an obsession for revenge and it seems she will go to any length to get it.<br /><br />Certainly not for those who don't have a love for twisted humor, but if you do, this movie provides enough darkness to keep you satisfied.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|I was sucked into buying this by reading the blurb. How \\"John\\" would have liked it, Big Lennys 70th birthday gift from Yono etc. Well, in my view, it is as much about Yono then John's contribution. On Double Fantasy circa 1981, Yono's contribution had flashes of grit like talent like \\"I'm moving on\\" and the lyrics on \\"Give me something\\". But, it was the launch of John into a more rounded set of songs that created excitement, enjoyment and sadly what if moments frozen in time. So disc one stripped down works but not for the reason stated. Yes, it's great hearing Lennon's vocals at the front but equally, it is good to see how well Yono's offering has buffed up, particularly \\"Hard times are over\\". Overall, the sound is clearer, instruments less over worked stand the test of time. Some great guitar. Would have liked notes that broke the tracks down to who played what. Likewise, the notes gave me the running curry date burn. So, brass well spent..but it appears the widow Yono is as sharp as ever on deal making. But if the product is this good, it is worth the buying.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|In this well-written and thoughtfully structured book, Isaacson presents a cohesive, balanced, and intimate portrait of Steve Jobs. Despite being neither an Apple fan nor a big reader of biographies, I most thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a fascinating and worthwhile read.<br /><br />If you asked me to name one word that unites this biography together, I'd say that word is passion. This is the biography of a relentlessly passionate man - a man with the visions of an artist and the ambitions of a dictator. A man who let nothing get in the way of his passion. Nothing. Not other people's feelings, not a sense of fairness, not reality. And although I wouldn't call this trait admirable (it's not admirable to treat others so ruthlessly), I would admit that there is something appealing about it.<br /><br />Given that this is the \\"official\\" biography, sanctioned by Jobs himself, one might assume that the author sugar coats Jobs' lesser traits. Luckily for us, Isaacson doesn't. Although he does select words like \\"prickly\\" when others might use more colorful language, Isaacson doesn't hold back in giving us stories about the good, the sad, and the ugly. The portrayal is nicely balanced. Whenever there are discrepancies in the stories, that is, in matters of he said/she said (or more often, he said/other he said), Isaacson simply presents both sides of the story. No one knows the truth, and Isaacson is generous enough to let the reader decide.<br /><br />No doubt, Isaacson's unprecedented access to the subject through countless interviews elevates this biography above other ones on Jobs. It feels intimate. Like we truly get to know what kind of person Jobs was and how that person evolved over time.<br /><br />Running at 571 pages, this is most certainly a massive book. It's packed full of information, and Isaacson is such an engaging writer that I kept turning the pages. There is so much to get out of this book; here's a sprinkling of the topics:<br /><br />There's obviously the history of Apple and Pixar. But also, Jobs' emotional turmoil of having been adopted. His impressively supportive parents. Being a fruitarian. An inside look into Jobs' \\"prickly\\" personality. His tumultuous love life and relatively calm family life. The reality distortion field. Samples of maniacal perfectionism. And towards the end, an almost heartbreaking devotion to building a ship.<br /><br />I'm sure that a lot more didn't make the final cut. But it's not meant to be encyclopedic, and I think the final product is simply perfect for mass consumption.y the history of Apple and Pixar. But also, Jobs' emotional turmoil of having been adopted.

B004LROMX4|5.0|This was a used DVD set from Hastings, a rental company.  I was a little hesitant with the DVD coming from a company where it had been veiw several times, but the quality was good and had no problems with any of it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! Dark, edgy, and intense, Gone Girl isn't so much a book to read as it is a roller coaster ride to experience. It opens on the fifth wedding anniversary of Nick and Amy Dunne. And before any celebrations can be had, Amy is discovered to be gone. And thus, the roller coaster begins.<br /><br />Beyond the suspenseful plot and the journey of emotions is a critical look at relationships. Flynn makes keen observations about the push and pull, the give and take of relationships. And anyone who has been in a committed relationship will see the reflections of their own experiences. Sure, the knee-jerk reaction will be to say, \\"I'm nothing like them,\\" and to distance yourself as far as possible. But for those who can stand it, looking into those tiny mirrors is what makes reading this book really worthwhile.<br /><br />Evocative, chilling, and efficient, the writing in this book is excellent. The author doesn't need to string together an excess of pretty words for it to have impact. Her descriptions are clear, sharp, and to the point. In addition to the efficient wording, the author alternates the narrative voice between Nick and Amy with distinction and ease.<br /><br />For me, I rate the first half of the book 4 stars, and the last half 5 stars. The first half is interesting enough to keep the pages turning, but the second half is where the author really shines. The ending is intense. I'm not sure if I've ever read something so intense. Crazy. Insane. Powerful. Like watching a massive train wreck that leaves you heartbroken for the suffering, wide-eyed in fascination, and slightly terrorized too.<br /><br />One word of caution. This book isn't for the faint of heart. It's not a feel good novel.
B0083EXW50|5.0|Reviews below talk a great deal about this sounding a great deal like previous Fear Factory.  This is very true and is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I won't get into my history with the band. Again, most reviewers who stop and take the time to listen/review/read such an incredibly underrated band like Fear Factory don't need to hear the same story.  I'll just say that I first heard them instrumentally on my copy of Carmageddon and have been hooked ever since.<br /><br />I'm a classic Metal fan (inception through about 2002) and a full-on Industrial metal fan.  This album satisfies me through and through and my only complaint is that it's too short and the vocals on the choruses aren't turned up loud enough.<br /><br />True fans of music listen to their music because it makes them feel.  The guitars on this album are outstanding, the drums are also well done (which surprised me), the keyboards are perfect.  Bell's vocals have always hit a part of my brain which seem to be solely dedicated to appreciating & being affected by the sound of his voice.  He is truly an outstanding vocalist and this record drives it home.<br /><br />I wish it was longer but it isn't worth taking a star over as the quality is top notch.  I just hope this sells well & more of these albums come out.<br /><br />Songs in fav. order:<br />  Depraved Mind Murder<br />  Difference Engine<br />  Virus of Faith<br />  The Industrialist<br />  Recharger<br />  New Messiah<br /><br />If you're a fan, get this album and play it on repeat.<br /><br /> - - - Update 10-15-12<br /><br />I remember when \\"Liebe ist für alle da\\" came out, it made me go back and rediscover Rammstein's \\"Reise, Reise\\" and some other deeper cuts off \\"Rosenrot.\\"  It's almost like the album matured me as a fan from a lack of instant gratification provided by previous albums (that still kick ass).<br /><br />I still listen to \\"The Industrialst\\" on repeat and can't bring myself to keep it out of the lineup.  I absolutely love therhythm and harmonies of this album.  I know saying that it's the best is a tall statement.  I say it's the best because I have listened to this more than any other FF album to date, and I didn't think that was possible.  I am incapable of getting sick of this album.  Please, please, keep making more albums.

B007SGM084|1.0|I am so sorry I ever bought this trilogy.  I went on word of mouth and it appears I have a lot of sick friends who think that violence and S@M and bondage make for a great novel.  Unfortunately, I bought it on vacation and didn't begin reading it until I returned and it was too late to return the trilogy and get my money back.  A couple chapters was enough for me and it sickened me on a couple levels.  The subject matter, the fact that the \\"hero?\\" chose such a young, innocent girl to abuse, the violence.  In the future I will not be so quick to listen to others' opinions.

B004L35GAQ|5.0|I bought the compact disc for one song \\"Sail\\" that was heard on the cable TV series \\"Longmire\\".  It was a background song in the \\"Dog Soldier\\" episode. The part played was an instrumental portion. The song fit the episode and after hearing the lyrics also, the song is that much more of an attraction.  It has a message.<br />  The remainder of the tracts are good music also. Check it out.

B005R2S04E|5.0|Downloaded this album because I read on a specific music site about great releases and this had 9.9 out of 10 stars based on critics' opinions. \\"Well, might as well give it a try.\\" So, paid my dues to an alternative shopping service (you know, it rhymes with lunes). Never gave CAN a chance since I had 30 other albums ahead of it to listen to, but one Saturday afternoon I decided to tell my iphone to shuffle my 40GB music library, and it landed on this weird-sounding introduction. I let it flow, it sounded weird but soon enough ecstatic; drums arrived and it felt like an initiation to a cult of adoration for musical art and sound. Awh, and what beautiful art. The song was \\"halleluwah\\" and it was simply a mix of orgasmic proportions.<br /><br />I couldn't get enough. The whole album is a journey of unlike proportions. I have never heard anything that sounds even remotely close to this, and it most certainly is not made to today's musical standards of two good tracks and 13 terrible fillers. The musical revolution to buy one or two tracks instead of a whole album was not made for CAN. This album is the definition of what music should be like. It deserves a 10/10.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|This movie was extremely interesting and intense. This movie although somewhat confusing it was satisfactory. This movie is all about dreams and the subconscious.

0143038419|4.0|What a beautiful story \\"Eat, Pray Love\\" was.  I can't say enough about this uplifting book!  The prose flowed off the page and took me on a journey with many ups and downs but left me feeling like a better person for reading it.  This book comes right after reading the Grey Trilogy and it may have cleansed my mind that needed a good dose of dusting off after those three low brow books.<br /><br />Gilbert's journey was incredible.  Being a person that is more of \\"space\\", instead of \\"place\\" I could easily identify with her and what must be her restless heart.  I love moving around and even though I often find myself lonely, I fear that I will not rest easy in one certain place.<br /><br />Gilbert discussed how this need to move contributed to the end of her marriage.  She was very graceful in not blaming her husband and explaining how painful the divorce was for her, but at the same time how vital it was for her mental well-being.  I was amazed how strong she was to be able to follow her heart instead of staying in what seemed like a comfortable life even though she had a restless heart.<br /><br />After her decision to leave she decided she would do what her life was calling her to do and what was foreshadowed by a palm reader years before.  Her adventure took her through Italy where she enjoyed the excesses of life, beauty and really food, then she moves on to the heart and soul of the book in India.<br /><br />In India Gilbert comes face to face with what turns out to be God speaking directly to her and how she comes to terms with him and listens with all her heart.  I found myself longing to have such a relationship with God and wondered why I didn't have the focus power to find him myself.  I sometimes feel like I am looking for the same thing when I'm running long distances in the woods, but have never had the experiences that Gilbert so eloquently described.  I feel honored and lucky to have read and actually felt her experiences through her writing.  I cannot describe her story telling abilities in any other way than to say that I felt her words.  I tried her simple mantra \\"I am that\\", but I was never able to hear a voice say like he did to Gilbert, \\"You have no IDEA how strong my love is\\"....wow, to have those word enter my mind would be such a revolution to my life.  I feel like I still struggle with the days that I called myself a Secular Humanist, and now as a professed and practicing Buddhist I find myself lost, yet longing for the knowledge that Gilbert found.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how the trip to India made the book for me.  The insightfulness that she found and the way she described it just made me long for wisdom more than you could ever imagine, but I must go on to the lighter and more fun conclusion of the book in Bali where she finds, accepts and rejoices in the beauty of a new found love.  Gilbert continues the search for wisdom and beauty in Bali and comes face to face with the palm reader that told her he would see her here again, but by this time she had mastered her inner self and befriended the wise medicine man and if she knew it or not visited with him as a peer instead of a master/student relationship.<br /><br />Gilbert took his advice and found love and the final chapters follows how love blossoms between a new man and a great new friend that was in need of help.  She comes to terms with what she need in life and discovers that her new found love is compatible with her heart, mind and soul.  The story left me feeling so good and a touch brighter for reading and I needed it after reading the Shades of Grey books!describe her story telling abilities in any other way than to say that I felt her words.

B007M45PMU|5.0|What a fun collection!  Singer/songwriters with a bit of wit.  Lead singer has a distinctive sound.  I'm sure this band was around first, but the lead sounds like Philip Philips from American Idol except he sings more melodies.
B006VA57CY|5.0|This show is amazing! A great family series which captivates the entire audience. The writing has a natural appeal to women and men alike. The acting is superb; the conveyance of the actors is make to look effortless and the character development is flawless!

B008MEM24S|5.0|I downloaded the free version for my 6 year old, got hooked, and made the purchase. The paid version uses a little more brain power, and I'm hooked even more. Definitely recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As with Book 1 and Book 2 the content is somewhat redundant, but this is a great end to a very entertaining \\"threesome\\". I would definetly recommend the Fifty Shades Trilogy to mature readers. But reading all three books is a must to allow the reader to see how a bit of sun can break through the shade.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|I like this CD..its really really really good. I think its way better than The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack from 2008. I play it almost everyday when im at the Gym getting buff like Bane. Hahah ;-]

B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this app because it's fun and fast moving.  Keeps you thinking and looking for moves.  I'm hooked for a good time!
0142406112|2.0|While the price was fairly decent for the item I was disapointed when it came in. The sellers advertised that it was 'New' and when I got the book it was worn around the edges and corners and even had writing on the inside cover! Apparently, the book used to belong to 'Rachel'. Other than that, I look forward to reading it.
B001BZF9UY|3.0|I only like about 6 tracks on this album. 6 out of 14 tracks isn't that good, But i like Batman so who cares!! I recommend buying the The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack instead. Its much much better!<br /><br />But the best track on this Cd is probably..\\"Watch The World Burn\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book! The entire series was great. If you havnt read it you must! I was pleased with the way it wrapped everything up. The only problem is that when I finished I wanted more! So much more! I even went back and re read the last few chapters. I finished a month ago and am restarting them now.
B00007E7K0|4.0|works great, just like the factory caps.  cheapest original canon lens for 58 mm on amazon.  arrived in about 3 days.  Only gave it four stars because..  \\"its a cap\\" not that exiting.
B000TENMV6|5.0|I am often on the hunt for clean sounding authentic Swing music to use for DJing at dance events. This album provides just that! Its got a ton of fantastic instrumentals and vocals that flow perfectly. A nice array of tempos and lengths allows this album to be used whenever I DJ. And my dancers do enjoy Louis and Duke
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Come on Rovio.  Angry Birds is one of the most well known mobile games of all time.  How can you still not have support for multiple users?  Many families have tablets that are shared which means multiple people might want to play the same game.  I have no way of tracking my scores and levels separate from the rest of the family.  Please add this feature.<br /><br />I'd bump this up to 5 stars if that feature was added.  Plenty of other games have user profile support so no reason they all can't.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|How cool that they could follow up &quot;Toy Story&quot; with an equally fabulous sequel. Who can forget the lines when the clueless Buzz Lightyear is battling Emperor Zurg and Buzz says, &quot;I'll never give in. You killed my father!&quot; And Zurg replies, &quot;No Buzz, I AM your father.&quot;<br /><br />And the visual jokes, such as when the toys are trying to rescue Woody, trapped in a suitcase rattling down a conveyor belt in the airport luggage handling system. Buzz chases the green case, and from the back, we see that across his derriere he has a baggage sticker for Butte, MT.<br /><br />And don't forget to watch the fake &quot;bloopers&quot; that accompany the credits!<br /><br />I decided to replace our VHS's of &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, and purchased the 2010 Special Edition reissue of each of them. &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; came out in theaters in 1999, and is as funny and heartfelt today as it was then. It was the third film for Pixar. &quot;Toy Story&quot; was 1st, and then &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;.<br /><br />There are ten Bonus Features on the DVD, and this is a list of the DVD extras, only. The second is the audio commentary track, where you watch the movie but listen to commentary throughout. Commentary tracks have become one of my favorite extras, and I'm going to cover it first.<br /><br />Commenters for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; are: John Lasseter (director), Lee Unkrich (co-director), Ash Brannon (co-director) and Andrew Stanton (co-writer). They are proud of the new programs that allowed them to make &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; look more realistic than &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Andy has a new puppy, Buster, received as a Christmas gift at the end of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. He is much more realistic than Sid's dog, Scud, could be. &quot;One of the new technologies... is that we actually were able to put real fur [on Buster]. The fur on the dog is like thousands and thousands of individual little hairs.&quot;<br /><br />Also, when the characters go outside, &quot;all the leaves on the trees are billowing and kind of gently swaying in the wind. The trees weren't like that in the first &quot;Toy Story&quot;. We did all kind of research on &quot;a Bug's Life&quot; and figured out how to make grass and leaves more like that.&quot;<br /><br />I never thought of it, but Robert Goulet sings Wheezie's big band version of &quot;You've Got a Friend in Me&quot; at the end of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.<br /><br />Can you find these homage moments in the movie?  Superman, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;, Jerry from the short &quot;Jerry's Game&quot;, Odd Job from James Bond, Star Trek, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;.<br /><br />Bonus extras on the DVD disc for [[ASIN:B0030IIZ56 Toy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)]]:<br />1.  &quot;Sneak Peek Toy Story 3 - The Characters&quot; (4:00 minutes) Lee Unkrich, director of TS3, shows us the recurring and new characters to come in the 3-quel. TS3 was released in Nov. 2010, while the Special Editions of 1 &amp; 2 were released in March 2010.<br />2.  Audio Commentary<br />3.  &quot;Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Episode 1: International Space Station&quot; (3:43) This confirms that a Buzz Lightyear action figure actually made it into space and the Space Station. Buzz covers many parts of life on the station, including EVA's, Extra Vehicular Activity, AKA space walks. &quot;When I was on board I observed that the average space walk was between 3 and 8 hours&quot;. Produced in collaberation with NASA, there's lots of real video from the station.<br />4.  &quot;Paths to Pixar - Technical Artists&quot; (4:24) Six people who worked as &quot;technical artists&quot; in TS2 talk. Fascinating stuff, and a good idea of what goes into perfecting the animation to look real. Lisa started at Pixar in 1995. For a young person who wants to get into animation, the most important thing is high school math! Algebra and geometry. For example, this equation:<br />a x b =  a   b  cosign theta<br />is needed to calibrate how light bounces around in a scene!<br />5.  &quot;Studio Stories: TS2 Sleep Deprivation Lab&quot; (1:25) The first draft of TS2 was not a success and they had to start over. Unfortunately, they had 8 months to do a year's worth of work. Narrated by Lindsey Collins, &quot;We were frequently actually working 36 to 48 hours straight. It was like a pysch lab.&quot;<br />6.  &quot;Studio Stories: Pinocchio&quot; (2:15) For TS2, Pixar was still housed in a giant warehouse. The rooms had high ceilings with insulation hanging. One day they decided to throw toys up so that they'd stick in the insulation. You may be able to guess how the Pinocchio doll stuck. Narrated by Doug Sweetland and Dylan Brown. Dylan mentions: &quot;I think we threw things in the ceiling because none of us had girlfriends.&quot;<br />7.  &quot;Studio Stories: The Movie Vanishes&quot; (2:32) Completed and draft footage are stored on several Linex and Unix machines. Command RM* starts erasing film as fast as it can. &quot;Somebody&quot; hit RM* and in 20 seconds a year's worth of work disappeared.

B008BM9L72|5.0|Thank you EL James!  I don't think I've ever read a book so quickly - I honestly had to force myself to put it down each night.  This book was the most engulfing and fun read I've ever had - are we going to see more from EL James?
B009329ZF2|5.0|I should have purchased this movie when it first came available.  Hello Hollywood!  Don't be the first blockbuster of the season, the looser cirtics was laying in wait.  FUBAR to the early reviews.  You critics are children who have no ability to put together the layers of this movie.  I am 52 years old, far older than the ignornat critics who couldn't understand the complete beauty of this movie.  HELLO! lame-critics!  Are you too stupid to recognize the actual war heros that were HONORED in this movie!  If you listen to the critics but are a proud and older American, watch and LOVE this movie...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its really reaallly kool nd nice but it wastes space in ur Kindle :) but other than that its pretty awesome!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is extremely awesome.  If you are sitting around doing nothing this is a game to take up that free time.  Another game is Rage of Bahamut.  If you use the referral code zzf69335 you will get a rare card and a bunch of money to start out with.  Have fun with the games!
B009329ZF2|5.0|LOVED IT-especially because the movie paid its respect to all the old salts and the USS MISSOURI battleship! I had the honor of visiting it while in Hawaii and am so pleased to see it was brought back to life once again. And as far as the movie...its just a fun action flick with some damn good music too.<br />GOD BLESS ALL THAT HAVE SERVED AND ARE CURRENTLY SERVING OUR COUNTRY.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|I thought the Blood album rocked hard with some gothic movements and some listless lyrics. I can feel the emotions from the singer and see the vision from her voice. If the singer from this band were to have a kid from the guy from Slipknot that would be quite the demon spawn.

B0090EIILU|4.0|I'm surprised so many people here are giving this one one star. And that it's only gotten 3 stars overall here. 65,000+ IMDB users rated it 6.6, which is pretty good for a comedy. Yes, Borat got 7.4, and this isn't as funny as Borat, but I'd say 6.6 is just about right. (I guess these Amazon reviewers would rate it a 3 or 4 on IMDB. Why such a wide variance, I don't know.)<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much, but my wife and I laughed our butts off! Assuming you \\"get\\" the jokes (i.e., are knowledgeable about recent world history) and liked his other movies, I fail to see why you wouldn't like this one enough to be entertained for 1.5 hours. Go with the IMDB reviewers instead of the Amazon reviewers and take a chance.

B000FA5STS|5.0|Once again DB writes a great book....while a little unbelievable in parts...it was very entertaining.  I think I've read just about every one of his books and this certainly didn't let me down.
B008MM9630|3.0|so far I think its ok. I love the game its just the times and prices are so outrages that I considered deleting this game! if you do not have a passward lock on it is so easy to buy things it is horrible! and the prices are so bad I mean to get most anything like animals or expanses you need gems witch  cost real money! you also need gems to speed things up! and for energy it takes five minutes to get one energy! it should take thirty seconds! and it needs more outfits please fix those!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good mix of games and definitely addictive. I work to earn the points so my 7-year -old can unlock the games she likes!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this was perfect for my kindle fire. it is easy use and the display is big and bright. it does not use a lot of battery life either which is nice. highly recommended if you just need a quick calculator for budgeting.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|1. I've probably played through this game 5 times now and it never gets old. 2. The pictures are beautiful, especially the waterfall. I wish I could have it as my screensaver! 3. Some parts are tricky, but figuring it out for yourself is part of the fun. It's all very logical.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Watched the original on blu ray last week so, naturally, tho I had the 2 disc Standard Def version, I wanted to buy the extended version on Blu Ray.  And glad I did tho I received just the single disc and I see that the Blu Ray and  Digital version are offered at the same price.<br />I watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.  Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.  There was only one scene towards the end, which contained an army officer in a truck of solders( don't want to spoil it so I am not saying what happens in this scene) that I thought could have been left out; seemed really cheesy to me.<br /><br />I'm not into book reports so here's my take on the transfer quality only.  Get it.  The video is quite outstanding...beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.  No grain, no artifacts, nothing to take away from  the demo transfer quality that this is.<br /><br />The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and, in many parts, is also demo worthy.  There really is an expansive sound stage and perfect directionality from the discreet speakers when appropriate.<br />Unless you don't like the movie itself, there is no reason not to have this King Kong on blu ray.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B008TRUDAS|5.0|\\"Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me, And when I lose my direction, I'll look up to the sky, And when the black cloak drags up the ground, I'll be read to surrender, and remember, Well we're all in this together, If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die.\\"<br /><br />-The Avett Brothers<br /><br />Slammed is a very touching and beautifully written story! I'm stunned this is Colleen Hoover's debut novel. This book is amazing! I have never been a fan of poetry nor have I ever read slam poems. This book made me a fan. To hear people expressing love, loss, pain, and truths in a poem felt very intimate and personal - like seeing into someone's soul. I would love to go to a slam poetry reading sometime. The other thing that is absolutely wonderful is the quotes from songs by The Avett Brothers at the beginning of each chapter and throughout the story. I think it's wonderful she used this group as an inspiration for writing her first book. I am a HUGE fan of this band and I completely understand Colleen Hoover's passion behind using music as her muse. My other passion besides reading is seeing live music. It's like poetry to me.<br /><br />The story opens up with us meeting Layken. Her mother has moved her and her brother, Kel, across the country from Texas to Michigan after their father passes way. They are trying to survive the aftermath in his absence. The very first day they move into their house, Lake meets her new neighbor Will and sparks fly. When Will takes Lake on a surprise date to her first slam poetry reading, an immediate connection is made. There is excitement, laughter, and intense chemistry. However, they soon find out there is an obstacle that could keep them a part.<br /><br />Lake is a very mature and realistic young woman. Still reeling over her father's death, she struggles with moving on and finding peace within herself. What I like best about Lake is her strengths, honesty, and witty personality.<br /><br />Will's passion for poetry is mesmerizing. The way he expresses his feelings about his parent's death in slam poetry gave the reader a small glimpse into his soul of the kind of pain he felt when he lost them. He has dropped everything in his life to do the right thing and take care of his brother. His struggle with being a mature adult and staying away from Lake is heartbreaking and frustrating.<br /><br />Because fate reared her ugly head, Will and Lake are unable to act upon their feelings for each other. But what's so beautiful about this, these two build a real friendship and are able to lean on each other. Even if it's confusing for Lake to be friends with the man she loves, she is able to lean on him when her world begins to crumble from some unexpected news.<br /><br />I felt connected to both Will and Lake immediately. I absolutely adore them. They are both extremely strong and intelligent people who I have so much compassion and respect for. If there are any two people that deserve to be together, it would be these two.<br /><br />The less you know about the revelation that changes things for these two, the better. I was shocked and sad all at once. Will and Lake's struggle to reel in their intense feelings and their quiet desperation to do the right thing created a storm of frustration inside me. Seeing the effects of the situation was powerful to read.<br /><br />I love all of the characters in this story. Lake's mother is a very cool and sweet woman. She's caring and laid-back. She instills good values and gives great words of wisdom to her children. I love how she lets them be themselves. I love Caulder and Kel, who are the little brothers of Will and Lake. These two form a friendship that is all their own. They are a lot alike. They both have strange quirks and oddities that made them bond immediately. And finally, you have Eddie who introduces herself to Lake on the first day of school and automatically claims Lake as her BFF. She's straight forward, loyal, and positive. Her slam poem \\"Pink Balloon\\" is one of my favorites in the story. I felt like her character brought more depth to the storyline.<br /><br />This story is about love, loss, and acceptance. This story made me laugh out loud and cry hard. This book touched me on a very personal level since I've loss someone I care deeply about. There were times when I had to put it down and just cry because my memories came crashing down on me. I'm definitely looking forward to Point of Retreat which is the second and final book in this series.<br /><br />Favorite Quote/Slam Poetry:<br /><br />\\"I got schooled this year<br />by<br />a<br />Boy.<br />a boy that I'm seriously,<br />deeply, madly, incredibly,<br />and undeniably in love<br />with.<br />And he taught me the most<br />important thing of all...<br />To put the emphasis<br />On life.\\"
B00770KR7W|5.0|Well i bought this Action Figure along with the Master Chief 3Pack. And I've got to say, that this one is pretty impressive. The articulations are more permissive than the last versions of the chief, as it was to be expected. And they hold in place.<br /><br />I like how the Assault Rifle holds firmly in the figure's hands and the number of postures that you can fix it. The paint job is very detailed.<br />I definitely recommend this one for a collector.<br />Really stands nice next to the other models.

B000244EMO|5.0|Before Arnold Schwarzenegger created a secret family out of wedlock, before director John McTiernan was smothered by legal woes and before Jesse Ventura donned a tinfoil hat, there was \\"Predator.\\" A tough-as-nails action epic, this little flick from 1987 added to Schwarzenegger's repertoire as the go-to guy for action flicks at the time and kicked open the door for McTiernan who would go on to direct other classics such as Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and Last Action Hero (?).<br /><br />A group of mercenaries led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) are dumped in the Central American jungle on what they believe to be a rescue mission. Almost immediately upon their arrival, it appears something is wrong. Dead bodies -- apparently skinned alive -- are dangling from the trees and all the while, Jesse Ventura won't shut up. It seems there is a much more dangerous enemy lurking in the foliage, one which can mimic its enemies and blend into the scenery much like a chameleon. This enemy is not of this planet, means serious business and is absolutely famished. This, of course, means it's \\"Game on!\\" for Arnold and the Predator.<br /><br />\\"Predator\\" is essentially the perfect action flick. While latter day efforts like \\"Rollerball\\" may indicate otherwise, McTiernan is (or was) a genuine master of his craft. The film is perfectly paced, the effects are solid (if admittedly bit dated by now) and not overpowering and the characters are brought to life by larger than life personalities. Schwarzenegger and Ventura are joined by the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham and Shane Black. Black, who wrote the script (as well as another action classic from the same year, \\"Lethal Weapon\\") brings the characters to life with so much testosterone it oozes out of the screen. Not in a gross way, but in the sort of way that makes you feel like you are hanging out with a group of good ol' boys, shooting the breeze and laughing at one inane joke after the other (\\"See, 'cause of the echo...\\"). That is, until carnage ensues and the gang drops off one by one. You'll be laughing one minute and be perched on the edge of your seat the next. Brilliant.<br /><br />While not quite in the same league as, say, Ridley Scott's \\"Alien,\\" \\"Predator\\" delivers the goods in spades. It has a fresh and original concept, a great cast and enough thrills to make it worth watching again and again. McTiernan's Hollywood debut boasts a significant amount of replay value, something which the dreadful \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\" flicks lacked and which most modern films of its ilk lack as well. So grab the DVD/Blu-Ray/VHS/Laserdisc/Hologram/Brain-implant, get to da choppah! and get ready for a good time.o...\\"). That is, until carnage ensues and the gang drops off one by one.

Equally as good.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I haven't actually purchased this series set, but I have purchased all ten seasons in their own single releases. First off, I'm gonna give my own personal summaries of what I consider all of Smallville's 'arcs' through out the whole ten year run and then my actual review. Here goes...<br /><br />The Ship Arc -- Season 1:<br />In a world where you stand apart from your peers and the country you live is at the brink of war, what can you do? For starters, attend your Freshmen year of high school! Young Clark Kent begins a unique adventure as his origin story commences, meeting the man whom is destined to be his greatest enemy, best friend Lex Luthor and all while trying to conceal a massive secret within a rather 'small' town. Learning from his Dad a certain secret laying dormant in the family's storm cellar, various stories take shape as Clark subtly tries fitting the pieces together regarding this hunk of metal and most importantly, where did it bring him from?<br /><br />The Heritage Arc -- Season 2:<br />In the wake of a devastating natural disaster upon Smallville, Clark's ship goes missing after its first activation in more than a decade. Now in his Sophomore year, young Kent does more research than ever into what could be an alien background, all while love interest Lana Lang and brotherly friend Lex explore their own family's secrets. This chapter in Clark's gripping journey takes him from the town he was raised in to the roof of the Daily Planet, the highways of Hub City, and a building in New York where a very special man awaits to reveal the stepping stones in his destiny.<br /><br />The Jor-El Arc -- Season 3:<br />Having met his biological father, Clark's fears and misinterpretation of this entity's messages lead into a downward spiral of rebellion and near madness. Only with the help and love of his Earth father can he be convinced to give his life back in Smallville another shot, leaving behind a messy life in Metropolis for his Junior year. This year more than ever, Clark learns how much a burden knowing his secret really is on those closest to him, with childhood friend Pete Ross going through his own issues, Lex experiencing a couple cracks with his mental foundation, and Jonathan Kent being warned by Jor-El's presence that it's time to own up on a deal...<br /><br />The Stones Arc -- Season 4:<br />Following months of having gone missing, Clark's Kryptonian father has taken desperate actions with ensuring Kal-El at last initiates the destiny he was sent to Earth to fulfill. Along this rocky road for both Clark and his mother, they meet a most curious assistant of Dr. Swann's and an even curiouser cousin of Chloe's, one Lois Lane! With Jor-El's ambiguous intentions put to a stop by these various individuals, Clark sets aside his 'Crusade' and with the awakening of his Dad, pursues a football career in his Senior year. Amongst reconciliation with Lex after a brief dent in their friendship and coming to terms with Lana moving on from him, Clark gradually comes to see there may be more to Jor-El's mission for him than ruling the world, that something over the northern horizon of fate awaits him when all three Kryptonian stones are gathered.<br /><br />The Fine Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 1-8):<br />With the construction of his Fortress of Solitude, Clark glimpses the start of a very prominent education in his life, that of Jor-El's Kryptonian Training. With his own lingering fears on Jor-El's intents still in the air and what the devastation a second meteor shower has brought to his town, Clark refuses to return in time to continue what he promised his cryptic father, having his powers stripped in consequence. During and after this mortal trial, he learns lessons about how carefully trust should be placed in others, this element leading to the definitive end of his and Lex Luthor's friendship. But what the college attending Kent has yet to realize is that a powerful force from Krypton awaits in one of his own classes, butdoes this artificial intelligence plan utopia or doom for his adopted home-world?<br /><br />The Transition Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 9-15):<br />As he faces his darkest hour, Clark Kent makes life choices that will further shape him into the period of his life many normal people go through all the time, one of confusion and finding one's self. With the loss of a close loved one he had more respect for than any other, Clark must endure grief and depression, giving up college after only a semester in the wake of a crumbling relationship with Lana. In the midst of his despair, former best friend Lex has reached his own point of no return in life, the moment where one decision from him shapes the destinies of himself and all those in his life. Will Lex ultimately have innocent blood on his hands?<br /><br />The Brainiac Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 16-22):<br />From continually visiting Metropolis to a trip down to Honduras, Clark takes a more proactive approach in letting Lana go and attempting to find the entity he once thought was a positive force from Krypton, Milton Fine. Or as he will come to learn, the Brain InterActive Construct, Brainiac. The sinister Brainiac is meanwhile on his own quest, one that involves manipulating Clark, his loved ones, even Lex into helping return Krypton's most dangerous inhabitant and an apocalypse to Earth as we know it.<br /><br />The Zoners Arc -- Season 6:<br />In the aftermath of his very first confrontation with General Zod, Clark finds himself trapped in the Phantom Zone and the only way out may bring several lethal criminals to Earth with him, all whilst Zod wrecks havoc on Earth in the body of Lex Luthor. With the status of his Fortress in question and Lana moving into a new relationship with Lex, Clark is more confused than ever on where to head with his life, but at the same time comes to realize it's time to stop seeing Jor-El as the 'villain' he once misinterpreted him as. In the midst of all this, young Kal-El makes a very important promise to Martha and himself for where to head with his life after the Phantoms are taken care of, in addition to learning from a certain green-clad hero how much more lays in the world beyond Smallville.<br /><br />The Bizarro Arc -- Season 7 (Eps 1-10):<br />In the battle with the final Zoner, Clark receives help from another alien hero in dispatching this Phantom-clone of himself before he can cause anymore harm. While ready to finally continue with his Training under Jor-El, Clark is given instructions on the first trial of it in which he must succeed, watching over his recently arrived cousin Kara. While Kara is busy adapting to Earth life and trying to stay out of the radar of a very obsessed and gradually more evil Lex, Lana may not be quite as dead as all previously thought, returning into young Mr. Kent's life and perhaps not for the greater good of him or the grand destiny which must be fulfilled. Only Clark himself, or perhaps two Clarks, can make the proper choices if he truly wishes to complete his first training trial...<br /><br />The Veritas Arc -- Season 7 (Eps 11-20):<br />Having failed the trial of Jor-El's to look over his cousin and now scrambled about how to find her, Clark's Fortress Training is on hold as he struggles to see if there's anything of long term value left in his relationship with Lana, all while Lex discovers a new obsession and this time the person may in fact be whom the young Kal-El was born to become. The final steps are taken in Lex Luthor's own epic journey toward becoming the 100% evil man destined to take on Superman, but where that seductive future awaits for him, a very difficult present engulfs Clark's world as a loved one returns and another is split off. The secrets of the Luthor family, Dr. Virgil Swann, and Oliver Queen's parents may hold some most important answers for Clark in lead-up to a crumbling confrontation in his Fortress.<br /><br />The Dual-Identities Arc -- Season 8:<br />With Lex missing in the aftermath of learning Clark's secret and the Fortress of Solitude gone, Clark is found in Russia after weeks of northern world wandering and with his powers eventually restored, thinks about the direction he wants his life to take with Lana out of it and no Training. Keeping in mind vital lessons he's learned through the prior couple months and tired by the farm life, Clark springs back into a life he hasn't had since high school, journalism! Clark Kent becomes a mild-fashion-mess at the Daily Planet, blending in the background of copy-boys as he sits across the desk from Lois Lane, as well as learning from fellow heroes how to begin the seeding preparations in a most 'Super' alias. But little does he know, a force from Krypton even more destructive than Zod lays dormant among the citizens of Metropolis, 'Doom'...<br /><br />The Kandorians Arc -- Season 9:<br />In the midst of what the general public will remember as Superman's 'Early Years', Clark makes a most prominent upgrade to the look of his shadowy alias and while called a couple \\"Blur\\"-related terms, begins donning the iconic 'S' on his chest with which to inspire hope. Also going back to the Daily Planet to touch back on his humanity following the dark aftermath left by Doomsday and his human camouflage, the fledgling cub-reporting Mr. Kent can't help but notice there really is something more between him and Miss. Lane. As he comes to terms with what this all means and attempts to help a few fallen heroes along the way, younger counterparts to hundreds thought long-dead on Krypton emerge through out Earth, amongst them is one Major Zod.<br /><br />The Superman Arc -- Season 10:<br />Not allowing himself to give up after what was nearly a self-sacrifice against the psychotic clone of General Zod, Clark returns to his farm to put on a very special suit his mother made for him, this most 'Super' suit involving a red cape and the iconic 'S' emblem in full-fledge \\"technicolor\\". Despite being denied this glory by anunexpectedly hostile Jor-El, Clark doesn't let that stop him from changing the black colors of his continually seeding alias back to a red/blue display. Learning and touching more on the ability of flight than ever before, the growing Mr. Kent comes to gradually understand the meaning of his Kryptonian father's actions, that he has dark issues which must be put behind him if he's to transition into the hero the world truly needs. Glasses, Flights, and soon Tights... Superman Begins!<br /><br />Now for the review!<br /><br />SPOILERS...! Hard to believe it's taken me this long to write up a review for what is no doubt in my top three of favorite television shows Hell, it's my second favorite to be honest, right behind Joss Whedon's Angel! But without veering off topic, Smallville is a favorite and as long as you know exactly what you're getting into (which is easy now that it's over), I feel it's worth the watch.<br /><br />Smallville is a unique animal amidst the various live-action incarnations of the Man of Steel, where unlike the prior movies and television shows, we get presented a 100% origin story. The emphasis in this prequel-esque scope is on 'the journey' over 'the destination' from beginning to end. In that sense, the series creators did indeed come up with their well known \\"No Tights, No Flights\\" rule, a self-imposed vow that ensured our Clark Kent/Kal-El character would not fully learn his ability to fly or don a certain iconic suit until the final hour of the last episode.<br /><br />However, it is worth noting that while these rules are never truly broken for keeps till \\"Finale\\" time, they are bent in some creative and rare ways, with the show's last two and a half years even providing a representation on the early years of Clark's alias (whom yes, does eventually don a couple 'S'-bearing suits). In the midst of the character's high school years and later on into his early-mid 20s, very gradual progress is also made towards Clark's mastering of flight,compliments of roughly ten brushes with it and a few training lessons. So needless to say while Smallville is very careful from refraining into full-fledged Superman territory, I don't feel we're cheated considering (thanks in part to some future-peeks) we get just enough insight into the future we know Smallville is leading towards to see how everything will work out.<br /><br />If you're a first time viewer of Smallville, I would keep all that in mind and also be well aware that it's best to look at the series as three or four separate core eras...<br /><br />Clark Kent's Teen Years: The first hundred episodes where during Clark's four years of high school and a semester in college, we see the full story of his friendship with fated rival Lex Luthor in the midst of his early interpretations to Clark's Kryptonian heritage.<br /><br />Kal-El's Lost Years: Between the 100th and 150th eps, this era is arguably the most stalling in regards to Clark's character, though he does make baby-steps towards his upcoming future in the midst of Lex Luthor's climatic evolution and the rebirth of the super heroes.<br /><br />The Metropolis Transition: Really more of a bridging piece covering the last three episodes of Season 7 and Season 8's first five eps, this very small era in Smallville is quite literally a transition in many aspects like changes in main characters and filming techniques.<br /><br />Superman's Early Years: Most likely what we'd all been waiting for since the pilot, starting with the unofficial two-parter \\"Prey\\" and \\"Identity\\" half a dozen eps into Season 8, this culminating era in Smallville spans all the way to \\"Finale\\" as we see the seeding of Clark's dual-identity PLUS the entire Clark/Lois/Kal-El love-triangle.<br /><br />Another aspect that makes Smallville so fun, though this is mainly explored in its second half, comes in the form of the limitless DC mythos featured. You really can't imagine how many fellow heroes and villains from the comics pop up, though Batman and Wonder Woman are sadly not among them (nor the more well known Green Lanterns and Flashes), it almost becomes half a live-action Justice League series. But at the same time, the first half of Smallville is very friendly to any newcomers to the Superman story, given how very few comic arcs are adapted prior to Seasons 7-10 and the rare amount of extra heroes prior to Season 6.<br /><br />Now if you are a comic fan, as I've said to many other folks, I think the best way to look at Smallville is... an ElseWorld story! Seriously, just like you would any animated adaptation, don't watch Smallville with the mind-set that it's leading into any specific Superman story that's come before, rather the only incarnation of Clark's full-fledged Superman years it is leading towards is the upcoming Season Eleven comics! Now there are some arcs adapted in prequel-esque manners ('Supergirl's Arrival' & a 'Kal-El's Return to Krypton' quickie in Season 7, pre-buried Doomsday in Season 8, various arcs like bottled city of Kandor & Justice Society's Fall in Season 9, with a couple more involving certain Fourth World characters in Season 10) while a decent deal of characters end up in desirable places by show's end.<br /><br />And if you really wanna know if Tom Welling wears the full-fledged Superman suit or not, just keep in mind the \\"No Tights\\" portion of Al/Miles' rule, evidently they REALLY meant that part... Well, we do sorta see him in it, at least the upper half for a very few rare shots of \\"Finale\\"! All we really don't see the actor in are the yellow belt, red trunks, red boots, or tightie-blue-tights over his legs, but please don't think that means we don't see the character fully in it! Personally, I think we got just enough, especially with Tom going the last two years straight donning the iconic 'S' on his chest (really, how many of us expected that prior to Season 9?) and even compensated for the red cape being CG in the finale by wearing one in fan favoriteepisode \\"Dominion\\".<br /><br />I hope this review, however insanely spoilery it was, helped any curious newcomers and entertained any fans looking for a fellow fan's positive attitude towards such an amazing masterpiece of origin exploration.

014241543X|2.0|I read this book last summer and gave it 1 out or 5 stars on Goodreads. I realize that this book got TONS of positive feedback and I feel kinda weird being one of the ones who wasn't crazy about it. That's never me. So this year, I read it for book club. I was thinking that maybe my feelings would change after rereading it. I suppose it did. I moved the rating up from 1 star to 2.<br /><br />To be honest, I just didn't think this book was anything special. The story itself was heartbreaking, yes, but other than that, it didn't do anything for me. If you've read it, you're probably thinking I'm crazy. The first time I read this book, I was so irritated reading to the end because I just wanted to finish it to know what Mia's choice was. This time, I was able to pay more attention to the incorporation of music in the story, and Mia's life overall.<br /><br />I liked Teddy, Mia's little brother, and Adam, her boyfriend. The parts of the story with Teddy made me feel emotional, whether it was Mia's memory or her present. I also really loved Adam. His raw emotion in the story was impossible to miss or feel. Yes, Mia was in a difficult position, one I never in my entire life hope to be in, but something about Adam and his love for Mia just took hold of my heart. He is the one reason I want to read the sequel, Where She Went, because it's told from Adam's point of view, years after the accident. I won't tell you more about it than that, for fear of spoilers.<br /><br />The vast majority of people who read this book loved it rather than hated it. I guess for once, I'm in the minority.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The trilogy was absolutely amazing!!! The trilogy is captivating and once you read the first book, you want more and have to read the other two! I'm re-reading the trilogy again because it was that amazing!
0439023521|4.0|I know so many people who have read THE HUNGER GAMES and loved it, that when I picked it up I was kind of nervous about not loving it. It's more common that, if the general public loved it, I'll love it too, but I was still worried.<br /><br />I was most surprised by how much \\"before the Hunger Games\\" there was: the reaping, the parade, the training, etc. I expected it to get to the Games pretty quickly. The before stuff was still good, it really gave us a good chance to see the Capitol as a whole and the role that they played in the story. It was also a great time to lay character foundations. I think that the whole first half of the book is evidence that THE HUNGER GAMES is not a stand-alone novel. There's just too much setting up for it to get far enough into the story that it'll be done at the end of 374 pages.<br /><br />The fact that Collins did spend so much time in character and plot development really is a plus. It definitely gives the reader time to connect to the characters. Even though we don't see Gale for long, we know that he's the most loyal best friend there is. And through the things Katniss remembers about Prim and her mother, we can definitely see what kind of people they are. Other characters like Haymitch and Cinna all add their own elements to the story.<br /><br />Katniss herself was a very strong female lead. Her main goal is to stay alive, and you can't have any flimsy girly-girl in an arena with 23 other tributes, fighting for her life. Katniss was the perfect heroine. Peeta was a great character, too. Although he seems half-useless in the Games, you can also tell he's a really great guy. What I loved about him was how he cared so deeply, and seemed like a genuine human being throughout the novel. No matter what the Capitol, or anyone else, threw at him I always felt like he was an honest, caring person.<br /><br />Since the majority of the book was about Katniss fighting for her life, there really wasn't a chance to develop much romance. It's constantly in the undercurrent because of their strategy, but any real romantic connection between Katniss and Peeta seems improbable and far-fetched. But I understand that. Either way, I'd almost like to announce myself as Team Peeta, but I feel like we aren't far enough into the love story to make any definitive conclusions ;).<br /><br />Overall, THE HUNGER GAMES is a whirlwind of a story that takes you on the incredible journey of a girl fighting to live. Although the pacing makes it evident that this novel is the first in a series, there is a lot that happens. It's definitely the perfect beginning to a series. I'm pretty excited to see how the story is going to continue.It's constantly in the undercurrent because of their strategy, but any real romantic connection between Katniss and Peeta seems improbable and far-fetched.

B000FDFVZ6|5.0|My daughter was assigned to read this book over the summer for school.  Unfortunately she is really not into reading unless it's about vampires.  I had to make her read it.  Then one day I caught her reading the book on her own without being forced.  She told me that it was such a good book.  So in my opinion, I will say for my non-reader teenager to love it, then it has to be a very good book.  I'm going to read it next!
0143119680|4.0|What a delightful book!  I really could NOT put it down.  If I was really mean, I could say there were cliches and I had a few premonition cringes but I was always pleasantly surprised that the telling didn't leave me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />An interesting romance evolved and kept me on my toes throughout...wondering....!  As a good book should!  The settings were wonderful which really added to the charm of the tale.<br /><br />I happily recommended this book to many of my friends who enjoy same the genre.  I might add, that I am reluctant to recommend books, as to do so, can open one up to unexpected criticsm - as evidenced by reviews by others.<br /><br />I, as my friends, have been enormously excited about the 'next instalment' but unfortunately, the pricing (Kindle) is extraordinarily prohibitive at $17.98.  The first book was $8.66 when it was purchased - a good price for a new author -  and although that price has now increased to between $10.88 - $16.00, the price of the 2nd book, sadly, has suffocated the \\"Yes, I absolutely must have it!\\" reflex.<br /><br />As, I and my friends are in Australia, we are unable to 'lend' books, thus, there will be only a few, who will invest the funds in the 2nd book.<br /><br />I'm sure that, the reading, will be enormously worthwhile and satisfying, but, there are other authors, for example, Patrick Rothfuss & Brandon Sanderson, who tell amazingly, fabulous tales, but the pricing of their books, makes one less squeamish in the investment.<br /><br />Despite my price criticisms, please don't hesitate to read the first book as I hope you will find it as pleasurable and delightful as I, and my friends, did.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little amp does amazing things.  I was frustrated when trying to watch movies on my Nexus 7 tablet on a plane or on a bus as the background noise was overpowering the sound of the movie.  This amp does a great job and allows me to easily watch movies in loud environments.  The sound quality is improved dramatically as well and my Denon AHD-1000 headphones sound amazing when listening to high-quality recordings.  I very highly recommend this little gadget if you frequently use headphones.  It's a great purchase and you won't be sorry.<br /><br /> The only thing that concerns me a little is that the on/off switch seems pretty fragile but has held up for the first few months well so still five stars from me.

B0041O40EI|1.0|Purchase of this puzzle is a bad investment of time and money. London was my home and there is no city I love more, so I expected hours of enjoyment from this puzzle. I like challenge and had no issue with the difficulty of putting together hundreds of pieces that have the same shape. Disappointment began to build, however, as I worked on the boring, tedious first layer. The minimal historical information in that endless expanse of one-coloured streets was a missed opportunity to educate and pique interest in what was yet to come. Upon completion of the entire puzzle my disappointment turned to real irritation. I was astounded by the lack of imagination that rationalized including the 20th century slabs of concrete that now occupy the old wharves, rather than many of the treasures that make London uniquely historic. Much may have been lost to the Blitz, but how could the old Guildhall, Leadenhall and Smithfield mkts, Somerset House, the Inns of Court, Horse Guards Parade, Lambath Palace, Southark Cathedral -- even the National Theatre -- and so many other more important sites in the oldest part of the city be excluded in favour of pieces of plastic that represent generic office towers? And surely it would have been of more interest to the puzzle-worker to have shifted the thing west to include Regents Park, St James's Palace, Hyde Park, Chelsea, and Kensington. What a waste!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Let me just say I am a sucker for a love story. But this was not a love story. This was a story of war. With government,  with mind,  with heart and with reality. Sounds crazy but this story wasn't about the love triangle between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale. It was about manipulation and war with government. Some readers kept reading and reading and because they want to know who she picks, instead of focusing on the main \\"idea\\". Its clearly promises what I'm saying in Catching Fire. Katniss didn't want to fall in love get married and have kids. She wanted to escape the games, protect her family, & kill Snow. This story is realistic to be set in a different world. Put yourself in her shoes. After reading some of the 1 star reviews, I see people find her heartless the way she left Peeta when he became a mutt. Granted, its fiction,  but you're the face of a war..people want you dead.captured.executed. Are you really worried about something you have no control over. This was an amazing book that took me less than 15 hours to read. And im pleased with it. Sorry if my review is scrambled but I'm excited with the way it ended.<br /><br />However, Finnick died in a gruesome way. It was summed up in a sentence. ( actually now that I type that kudos to the author. The story was written through Katniss. And she knew when he was killed she had to keep it moving. And she did. With no time for her to reflect on it,  so neither Did the reader). She rushed the ending a bit. But it was amazing.<br /><br />Awesome story.

B00899E5B4|5.0|Joe Walsh has always been one of my favorite guitarist/musicians.  I have listened to his music since the James Gang.  This CD may seem a little bit corny at times but it sounds great, the songs are fun and it seems like a continuation of his \\"life's been good album\\" from years ago.  If you are a Joe Walsh fan, you'll have to get it. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it.  If you're not a Joe Walsh fan or if you haven't followed his music or antics over the years, you might not give it the same rating.  Joe is still cool!
B0009QBLA8|5.0|I searched for this movie for years, and no luck...finally a month ago I found it on Amazon. The DVD is great and has a few extras as well.

0374214913|5.0|As an ardent bibliophile, I'm always tempted by books in which bookstores or libraries play a primary part.  When the synopsis of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore described a young clerk in a used bookstore getting drawn into a mysterious and possibly mystical group of code-breaking bookstore patrons, I was extremely excited.  However, having been burned in the past by tantalizing plots with absolutely no payoff, I tried not to get my hopes up too much.  My internal restraint was put to the test on the first page, and it was completely demolished by four sentences on page 12.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is almost astonishingly amazing.  I have no qualms and no complaints, except that it's the author's first book, so I can't rush out and get more where this came from.<br /><br />The combination of modern day technology (Google is a major player here) with a 500 years old cult obsessed with breaking a literary code is perfectly balanced.  The characters, especially Clay the narrator, are sufficiently entrenched in the 21st century to doubt the possibly of magic and hidden mystical knowledge, but they are also part of a culture in which Tolkien and Rowling are so pivotal that it is almost impossible not to want to believe in wizards and magical rituals.<br /><br />This novel is fast-paced, surprising, and completely well-executed.  The first thing I did when I finished was make a list of all the people to whom I absolutely have to recommend it.  If you like fantasy or puzzles or really good books, read Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|What parents need to know<br />Parents need to know that although the bestselling Hunger Games books are enormously popular with tweens, there's a clear distinction between reading about violence and seeing it portrayed on screen. Developmentally, the 10- to 12-year-olds who've read the book may find the movie's visceral, sometimes bloody teen-on-teen violence upsetting -- especially the brutal scene that opens the Games, in which several teens are slaughtered by their fellow contestants. Even young teens need to be mature enough to deal with the 20+ deaths in The Hunger Games; characters are viciously dispatched with various weapons -- including spears, arrows, and swords -- as well as by having their necks broken, their skulls cracked, and their bodies ravaged by carnivorous and poisonous creatures. Despite the violence (which is, overall, less graphic than the novel's descriptions but is still very intense), the movie explores thought-provoking themes about reality television, totalitarian government, and screen violence as entertainment. And Katniss, the main character, is a strong heroine who's resourceful, selfless, and a true survivor. Her mentor, Haymitch, is initially depicted as a cynical drunk, but he ultimately proves to be a valuable ally. more on this at [...][[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|This thing is ultra convenient. One of the drivers in buying it was that I was traveling overseas; I wanted a bag that would let me carry my computer and a limited amount of camera gear. This fits the bill, plus, most importantly, it has a collar that slides over the handle of your wheeled luggage, so that it can go along for the ride when you're dragging your luggage through the airport, and, in my case, trains and buses as well. It has an outside zipper pocket for the camera body itself. The pocket is deep enough to hold a digital SLR with a moderate zoom lens attached. There are plenty of compartments inside for accessories, plus a removable zipper pouch. You could even slip a laptop and an iPad into the two internal sleeves, though only your back muscles know whether that's a good idea. I manage to hold two additional lenses, a polarizer, iPad cords, and compact binoculars in mine. I wouldn't be without this bag, though I did lend it to my wife for a trip to Israel this summer. I missed it, and almost bought another. I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was very well written.  I did not even realize it was self-published until I started to do more research about the author and the series and how it came about.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the post-apocalyptic novels.  This was right up there with the Hunger Games trilogy and Divergent. Even better than those books, it had more of an \\"adult\\" spin on it and the main characters were not teens.  Good read and worth the price!

B00005N6KG|4.0|I have a really hard time with ear-buds, they all hurt my ears. These Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones are perfect for my problem. They sit comfortably just outside your ear canal. They are very lightweight and comfortable, but also a little flimsy. Don't let your kids play with them. Sound quality is nice, could have a touch more bass, but overall decent sound. Listening to Maroon 5 remake of Prince's song Kiss right now. Sounds pretty good. :) Cord could be a little longer, but that's just my personal preference. For under $8, I says it's a good deal.

Beautifully written, I daresay, you will not come away dry-eyed.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I sort of impulse bought a kindle for going back to college, and I am the weirdo that likes to put a screen protector and a case on my touch devices before I even power it on. I picked this case because of the color (going with a pink theme this year) without really reading many of the reviews, and placed my order. Package arrived a few days later (all at once, in one box, thank jeebus. woulda been torture to have the kindle but not the case)<br /><br />I then opened up my case, and was super happy about it, and went to read the reviews (as well as leave one). Oh boy! I did not expect to see so many unhappy people.<br /><br />I don't know if they've changed the way they make these, but I don't think everyone here is looking at the same product! The strap is NOT glued on. The material feels nice, is not super cheap feeling, and is so far holding up very well. It's very attractive to look at, open or closed. And I have had no problems with it sitting up in the little indent in the cover. Is it terribly stable like.. say a plastic stand would be? No. Of course not. But if you're looking for the stability of a plastic stand, go buy a friggin' plastic stand! The only time I would have it standing up would be sitting on a TV tray on my bed, or something. It has not fallen, or even so much as wobbled.. So as long as you aren't trying to have it stand while jumping on a trampoline, it should be fine.<br /><br />That being said, I love this case. I wish there was a neon green version, because I would love to have that too.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|I went in to this story expecting the premise that the title and blurb promised, a quirky look at life on an original Enterprise-style starship from the perspective of one of the redshirts who are always getting killed on away missions.  I certainly got that, but the book develops into so much more, and I was actually very surprised at some of the turns that the book takes.  It's a very fun ride right up front as it goes down the list of tropes to be found in Star Trek, exploring them all from the eyes of a man in the trenches, but the story gets better and better as it turns more and more self-aware and meta.  Some of the directions that Redshirts explores were genuinely interesting, and it keeps the narrative fresh throughout as it broadens the scope of the premise.<br /><br />The thing the surprised me the most about this story is that parts of it are genuinely touching.  It's far from a tear jerker, but if you're anything like me, then there will be passages that will make you stare at a wall for a little while.<br /><br />I got much more than I expected from this story, but it never failed to deliver on its original premise.  It's fun, self-aware, and a great read.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I'm in my 30's, decently geeky, and love video games. Needless to say, I got pretty much every reference in this book, so that may color how much I enjoyed it. It's a blast to read, the pacing is perfect, and it gets gaming and gaming culture about as right as anything--certainly any fiction--I've ever read. It's a fun, fun book, but I can't shake the feeling that it could've been better. A few quibbles:<br /><br />- I could've used more of a balance between the real, dystopian world and the virtual OASIS world, especially in the first act. That would've really ratcheted up the tension and more subtly underlined the themes of escape, environmental decay, financial collapse, and loneliness.<br /><br />- The entire book is pretty much one deus ex machina after another. It's a credit to the creativity of the original idea and the flair with which it's handled that I really didn't care. Just saying.<br /><br />- You can see the ending coming several miles off. Again, the story is so swashbuckling and fast that you really won't care.<br /><br />Minor critiques, but if you like pop-culture, sci-fi, the 80's, and video games then you will burn through this book in about two days.
0143039482|5.0|Steinbeck wrote this book to address the moral degeneration of America. I don't believe there was such a degeneration, I believe this is the way humans have always been.<br /><br />Regardless, Steinbeck never passes on the opportunity to teach us something about ourselves. These lessons range from insightful domestic truths to bigger, more easily identifiable truths about what motivates us to make our decisions. He doesn't allow his readers to rationalize or gloss over Ethan Hawley's decisions despite Ethan's own attempts to do just that.<br /><br />His grasp of different characters make me smile as I relate to myself and the people I love, and the dialogue between these characters is witty and more fast-paced than any Steinbeck book I can remember.<br /><br />Some gems:<br /><br />\\"No one wants advice--only corroboration.\\"<br /><br />\\"In poverty she is envious. In riches she may be a snob. Money does not change the sickness, only the symptoms.\\"<br /><br />\\"She gave the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her.\\"<br /><br />\\"You wouldn't be so worried with what folk think about you if you could know how seldom they do.\\"

B0007LXPBI|5.0|I remember seeing the trailer for The Parent Trap in the summer of 1998. I had already seen and enjoyed the original 1961 movie but was quite impressed by what I had seen in the trailer. Unlike many of the remakes that are coming out these days, this looked quite refreshing and an unexpected hit from Disney. So when I finally saw the film two times in the theater that August, I couldn't have been more impressed. Yes, this maybe the only movie to date that I viewed in the theater twice and for my vote, it was for good reason.<br /><br />This is a fun, witty and sweet little movie that I continue to enjoy. A lot of this is due to Disney getting Nancy Myers to co-write the screenplay and direct the film. She had been writing screenplays for years by this time and even had a few hits in her resume, Father Of The Bride Parts 1 and 2 being the most successful. To make her directorial debut, she agreed to helm a remake of the classic 1961 film for Disney. They couldn't have hired anyone better. A tremendous talent in screen writing and directing and deserves to be placed with Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder. While this is you could say a children's film, Myers provides enough class and wit that people of all ages can enjoy it.<br /><br />As for the cast, everyone did a great job and bring a lot of humor and sensitivity to the characters. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson was amazing casting and both play the mother and father roles in the most believable way. I enjoy their scenes together. Of course, there is the delightful Lindsey Lohan. I really don't know what to say about her personally but as an actress, she is a remarkable talent and this movie shows it. I remember being impressed by the trailer at her capabilities to pull it off. She's quirky, fresh and fun to watch in both roles as Hallie and Annie.<br /><br />Dean Cundey was the cinematographer on this film who is known for his wide variety of work, from Halloween (1978) to The Thing (1982), from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to Jurassic Park (1993), from Apollo 13 (1995) to The Parent Trap. Because of his brilliance, he was brought in for the film's amazing technical work. Montion control had been used before many times and even Nancy Myers herself has said that she wasn't sure how it works but it is used to astonishing effect here. With Lohan's talent to play the wisecracking Hallie and proper Annie, motion control allows you to appreciate the differences in the two twins and also, the similarities. My favorite shot in the movie is when Lohan as both Hallie and Annie are looking in the mirror after Annie gets her hair cut. A one shot that gives the young actress in both roles a chance to walk in and out of frame as well as give lots of dialog.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie in my opinion. It's a feel good movie with a lot of charm and as I say class that I highly recommend it. Rent it or better yet, buy it if you ever get the chance.ho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to Jurassic Park (1993), from Apollo 13 (1995) to The Parent Trap.

B000O599WG|5.0|When Rio Bravo was released in the spring of 1959, it didn't receive the best reviews but time has proved how inspirational and timeless this movie is. Unlike most westerns at the time like the films of John Ford, it doesn't deal with moral or racial issues. Ford's deeply haunting and emotional The Searchers (1956) is an example. While director Howard Hawks' film is more fun and less dramatic, it is arguably just as personal as anything Ford ever did.<br /><br />Hawks is a director who has had a profound influence on many American and even foreign filmmakers and critics. He made films that are perceptive and witty but also because he was maybe the most versatile director at the time, his work has found a wide range of audiences. Rio Bravo continues the many themes of most Hawks' films and this time, I would argue that it comes together in the best way. From the very first scene, which is a brilliant piece of silent filmmaking, we get a clear idea who each character is and it sets up the story perfectly. We are then taken on a journey of action, adventure, comedy, romance and even drama and self discovery.<br /><br />I won't give away too much in this review because I feel that it would ruin the emotional impact. To understand this film is to understand Hawks as a storyteller who brings together a unique group of characters who are flawed but by sticking together, they can get the job done and come out stronger people. Dean Martin gives an amazing performance as a man who is fighting with the bottle, we assume that he is weak but we get an understanding to why he is struggling and also, when he holds it together, can be very quick and sharp. I've always thought that Martin plays a character that we can all relate to because we can all find ourselves in that position in life and call me sentimental but it's a moving look at any of us are capable of many things but must fight our demons in order to see it and move on.<br /><br />John Wayne is at the top of his game here, just as much as in The Searchers. He plays the sheriff in town who is in a tough situation and can't get caught up with the new girl in town. It's one of the best romances that only Hawks could pull off. They clearly don't understand each other but is obvious that they can't live without each other. We get a lot of the Hawks wit and insight on men and women as in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have And Have Not (1944) and it's always fun to watch. Hawks was the best with romance in my opinion, he always got the best out of his actors as well.<br /><br />We see many other characters through out the film and always understand who they are. Not one dull or underdeveloped character in the whole film the way I see it. The point in this review is that Rio Bravo is the best example of what makes a strong Hollywood film, also Howard Hawks in general. Hawks always made fun movies but the characters were never not thought of and never taken for granted, they were always personal to Hawks as well. Today, big advanced special effects distract us from what makes a good movie, the story and the characters. Maybe my review is too simplistic but for me, Rio Bravo is a great movie that holds up and is still as relevant today as it ever was. Higly recommended.e, just as much as in The Searchers.

0812993292|5.0|It's rare I feel the need to review a book on Amazon, but The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is an exception.  This book was sweet, slow, poignant and beautiful.  So beautifully moving and worth every moment it's in your hands.  You need a bit of patience, as it's a slow going read.  Sort of like you're meandering along with him, but I can't express just how wonderful the payoff of sticking it out.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I had been debating as to what I should do just incase another edition should be released at a later date, but from everything I've read and been told I decided to go ahead and buy the special edition version tonight, and I have to say I'm very impressed with it! The quality seems to be good, and it looks great! I especially like the way they have put the words \\"WALKING DEAD\\" underneath the zombie head in bold silver letters.<br />I made my purchase at BB, they had only one left in this big box, and the funny thing is the sales associate asked me if it was alright for him to take it out of the box and take a look at it out of curiousity since he had never seen one and I told him it was cool. He even took a picture of it on his cell phone. Then a couple who were buying a tv commented on how much they love The Walking Dead.<br />I've placed this scary looking zombie right next to my television with the screwdriver intact! So, if you have any doubts about it, I say just go for it since it might not be around for too long or the price my increase when the quantites are limited. I paid 60 bucks for it. I haven't checked out the bluray as of yet but I'm pretty sure it's going to rock as well as the sound in 7.1 Dolby Digital. All in all, this is very highly recommended!<br />Just an update: I looked at the figure again this morning, and I just wanted to say that the paint job on the zombie could have been a bit better and shinier perhaps as one person ( Craig ) has pointed out. He has definitely made some very good observations about the item even being somewhat different then the actual picture on the box, with which I am totally in sync! He's uploaded some excellent comparison pics and I have to say it now disappoints me to a certain degree seeing this! To be honest, it would have been cool to pay a few more dollars to get the zombie face exactly as it is shown on the box, but it is what it is I suppose!<br />2nd update: 9-3-12:- I wanted to add that watching it on these discs is so much better as you have no commercial interruptions and it really immerses you into everything. I just can't get enough of it. I'm on my third disc and loving every second of it! As for some who are complaining about picture quality, well, this is the way it was actually shot, I think it looks outstanding on bluray, the picture is clearer and the colors are well defined despite some grain now and then.<br />I have discovered one particular site where you can go and read up on movie/series reviews when it comes to picture quality and sound. They cover alot of ground on dvdtalk.com, thanks!e discs is so much better as you have no commercial interruptions and it really immerses you into everything. I just can't get enough of it.

Just glad its not another farmville.<br /><br />Update!!!<br /><br />I've now been playing this game for a few days, and while I still think its a great game to waste time on - I highly suggest to refrain from spending real money on anything for the game. There's TONS of bugs which make it totally impossible for you to complete a lot of missions. Right now the majority of vehicles I upgraded, are totally stuck, and won't move. It doesn't matter if you sell stuff off and try to redo portions, they'll still get stuck.

1401937519|4.0|ThanK you Dr Wayan Dyer for recommending in reading Anita Moorjani book. Althought I disagree with her regarding death were good people and bad people are going to the same place but,it did open my mind to see another view of life after death. Still hard to believe I would be with people like Hitler,Stalin,911, and so many evil individuals. As for a person of faith or no faith at all, if one is a good human being, one may have a good life after death. I believe in this. I looked up NDE and OBE and talk to family who had experience mostly OBE. I would not had bother talking to them if I didn't read this book. I looked up other similiar books but these books bring in their faith. That turn me off. I would recommend this book to read to see another point of view in life after death.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm unhappy that there were only three books and now I'm in withdrawals.  I read constantly - don't watch TV - and it's been a long time since a book hooked me faster or deeper than this trilogy.  Were there things some would have changed - well sure - and when YOU write your own book, you can do it the way you want.  However the writing was so absorbing that minor details that in a less interesting book would have driven me nuts, just didn't even cause a pause here.  Loved this trilogy.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I got this book when it first came out.  I was looking to lose weight after gaining a few pounds from quitting smoking and I figured this looked interesting.  I have to say, within the first few days of this eating style, I wanted a smoke, God, it was not the most friendliest of plan.  The critics make a good point when they say that he lays out some things that are hard to find and do.  But, if you don't follow his eating plan laid out in the book, which I didn't, then you're pretty much just following a low carb plan.  I'm Italian, eating a low carbohydrate diet is like a shark being a vegetarian.  It's completely unnatural.  But, I do remember taking some nieces to see a cartoon where there was such a shark, so I figured if it works, yipee.<br /><br />It worked.  I cut out about 90% of the wheat from my diet and about 80% of carbs.  I felt better, less anxious, less distracted, with more energy and the weight was coming off in leaps and pounds.  I couldn't believe it.  My body was feeing great, wonderful, superb.<br /><br />After a few months, I had lost more than 20 pounds, which is utterly unbelievable, because, I'm not that big to begin with.  I would figure it would take years to drop those twenty pounds.  But it didn't.  My only problem was the carbs.  And eventually, yes, I do confess, I did start to eat carbs woefully in abundance, and began to eat a bit more than I probably should, but, it took more months to put on 15 pounds of what I lost than it took to lose it in the first place.<br /><br />My story is one of success and failure.  But, I wholly recommend this book.  It's absolutely wonderful.  It really does teach you about a lot of problems with wheat.  I gave the book to a friend who has been wheat free now for six months and had sinus issues clear up, rosacea clear up, they felt better, looked better, and were overall better in every aspect of their lives.  It was amazing, a beautiful and wonderful turn around for them and they owed it all to thisbook.<br /><br />On my front, I've already started losing the weight again, getting off Wheat once more--unlike some fad diets, this one doesn't seem to stop working after you stop using it once.  I'm feeling great.  I recently bought and read a kindle book that I think compliments this one really well in some parts, [[ASIN:B008YH9S9U The Three Diets Solution: The Proven Methods For Fast and Sustainable Weight Loss]].  It says something I've never heard and never thought of before, which is that pretty much how you lose weight doesn't have to be how you keep the weight off.<br /><br />Critics who say Wheat Belly is just a repackaged low carb diet are missing the point.  There's a reason this way of eating is becoming more and more recommended and that's because we're discovering more and more that carbohydrates are the enemy and a major cause of obesity in America and around the world.  Critics who say it's too much science and too many complicated foods, stop looking at his food lists, and look at what you can eat and what you can't eat, and follow that, that's what I did.  I don't have the money to be going and looking for foods everywhere and paying big bucks.  I can't afford the organic meats or vegetables.  I know a still lost a lot of weight, so, I guess that's up to you to decide.<br /><br />I do recommend a couple other books that are more diet related:<br />[[ASIN:B008YH9S9U The Three Diets Solution: The Proven Methods For Fast and Sustainable Weight Loss]] (this one really did surprise me, no fluff, just diets, how to use them, and why they work, and how to make them work for you, he calls himself a weight loss enthusiast)<br />[[ASIN:0982207786 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)]] (if you want a great book, a really great book on how to lose weight, feel great, and change your body, this book is it.  I haven't put a review for it yet, I just opened my amazonaccount--how behind the times am I--but, it's full of success stories, great science... also, I suggest going to his blog)<br />[[ASIN:1439190275 New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.]] If you're not thinking about following Wheat Belly full on, you may want to fully understand low carb eating and no better place to start with the doctor's carrying on the work of Dr. Atkins.  Full of the science and details on how to plan your meals, it's great.

0307346617|5.0|I am not a zombiette or zombier. Vampires are my undead of choice. But, a friend HIGHLY recommended World War Z so I read it. A-m-a-z-i-n-g book. Max Brooks is a genius. 10 years after a worldwide zombie war, a journalist interviews survivors. This book made a zombie war and its outcome totally believable. My favorite is pages 209-230. The journalist interviews Colonel Christina Eliopolis at Paarnell Air National Guard Base, Tennessee. Her story of survival is when she was flying a resupply mission to a safe zone from Phoenix, Arizona to Tallahassee, Florida. Her plane crashes in the swamps of Louisiana. Her path out is filled with zombies. I loved her story. There were many, many great parts of this book, but her story is really compelling.<br /><br />This is a great historical fiction book as well as a zombie book. Put aside any preconceived zombie notions and read this book!!!

B001ACME2E|5.0|Barbara Wertheim Tuchman (1912-1989) was an American historian and author; she won the Pulitzer Prize for her book [[ASIN:0345476093 The Guns of August: The Pulitzer Prize-Winning Classic About the Outbreak of World War I]].<br /><br />She wrote in the Foreword to this 1978 book, &#34;The genesis of this book was a desire to find out what were the effects on society of the most lethal disaster of recorded history... the Black Death of 1348-1350, which killed an estimated one third of the population living between India and Iceland... Although my initial question has escaped an answer... it is reassuring to know that the human species has lived through worse before.&#34; (Pg. xiii)<br /><br />She observes early in the book, &#34;That conflict between the reach for the divine and the lure of earthly things was to be the central problem of the Middle Ages.&#34; (Pg. 6) She adds, &#34;The Church gave ceremony and dignity to lives that had little of either. It was the source of beauty and art to which all had some access and which many helped to create...

B0000942LT|4.0|So it turns out that 14 Shades of Grey and 50 Shades of Grey aren't very similar at all. It was very hard to masturbate to but I got the job done!
1607887215|3.0|I understand that Lena has a lot going on with her in this novel and that she's got to fight a lot of self-doubt and other issues, but she spent most of this novel being a complete and utter snot. Even though it gets kind of justified-ish later on, I kept wanting to reach into the book and shake Lena into getting a little common sense.<br /><br />The good thing about this book is that the narrator does a very good job in capturing tones, voices, and scenes. This really helped propel the book along because like its predecessor, it suffers from being a little overly long in a lot of places. The production values of this book are fairly high. It's just unfortunate that the voice for Liv sounds a lot like Stewie Griffin's voice. I know the narrator can't help this, being a guy doing a female accent, but it was pretty unintentionally hilarious at times because I kept imagining Stewie in a blonde wig. I loved that we got a deeper look into the tunnels in this book and more explanation of why it's so dangerous for mortals to be down there. That's one of the neater part of the series, the Caster tunnels.<br /><br />The downfall essentially comes down to how slow the book is and that at times Lena seems a little too overly dramatic. Don't get me wrong- I'm glad that the writers took a chance with making Lena unlikable in this book and so melodramatic, mostly because this is a very teenage thing to do. When you're only 16 years old and you've got this much responsibility and stress raining down on you, it's understandable to see someone go all \\"bad girl\\". I just think that at times she was a little too overly dramatic, which made me occasionally despise her. I can't entirely harp on this since it was such an important plot point, but still... The slowness didn't help either, as there were several parts that just sort of dragged along and brought out Lena's attitudes that much more.<br /><br />I ultimately liked this novel. It's somewhat faster moving than the first one and we're given a bit more, but I still have yet to be so taken with this series that I'd rush out and get the next book pronto. If I hadn't already had this queued in my library account I'd probably have put off this series for a little while. It's decent and if you like slow gothic series then I'd recommend it.'re given a bit more, but I still have yet to be so taken with this series that I'd rush out and get the next book pronto.

B0074JODP8|5.0|It is a real shame that the \\"mainstream music\\" stream is dominated by generic AOR where folks like the Jonas Brothers and whatever manufactured group-of-the-day \\"band\\" are viewed as \\"musicians\\"  I have played the guitar for about 30 years all around the world and can't listen to the \\"Mix/Hot/Hits\\" radio stations anymore due to the lack of innovation, overuse of sampling and copycat lyrics.  Joe Bonamassa blows every other guitar player out there today away.  This DVD was my real intro to Joe and I am now hooked. I can't wait to see him when he comes to DC this fall.  Buy this DVD and you will NOT be disappointed.
B008GFI4KY|4.0|Cheesy, Sleazy and Tongue in cheekily, The Darkness make their return with their third CD, \\"Hot Cakes.\\" (No, not the Carly Simon album from 1974...). From the pseudo-seventies sexism of the cover art to the glammy Queen-sized vocals and AC/DC guitar chunks, they sounds like they've not missed a beat since \\"One Way Ticket To Hell...And Back.\\" They're half hard rock tribute and half inside joke, with the terrific part that Justin Hawkins knows that they can rock as hard as they wannabe and that they're 100% cool with being in on the joke.<br /><br />Take the opening track, \\"Every Inch of You.\\" Telling a semi-autobiographical tale of a \\"English man with a very high voice\\" who discovers Led Zepplin who went from \\"loser\\" to the man for whom all audience members want to suck in a protruding body part...wailed in that very high voice. Then you get the total Queen ripoff, \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us\\" and the Angus slamming guitars of \\"Everybody Have a Good Time.\\" Derivative stuff all, and every inch of it pure fun. Even the hoary power ballads come off with a wink. The Darkness are smart enough to know that they posses about as much menace as a litter of puppies and subtlety of a given British Tabloid.<br /><br />It's that thay have this much obvious glee in doing what they do that makes them so likeable. \\"Hot Cakes\\" won't break any new ground, but don't let that stop you. I'd take the self-informed fun of The Darkness over the parodied self importance of a cookie-monster vocal-led rock band any day of the week.

B000024JEX|5.0|This six CD boxed set came out a few years ago.  I was turned off with the +$120 price so I backed off.  Recently I saw the set on Amazon for $68 so I got it.  At last view the price on Amazon had risen to $90-something.<br /><br />The material is conventional Jarrett standards material using his usual Peacock/DeJonette players.  I guess the word \\"conventional\\" is a bad word since there's nothing conventional about Jarrett's standards material.<br /><br />Jarrett demonstrates his vivid aural imagination on this six CD set.  His ability to improvise the changes continues to keep one's interest.  Enough's been said about his extraordinary talent and I can add no more at this writing. Peacock and DeJonette accompany like a well-oiled sewing machine.<br /><br />But let me mention some other things about this outting that the Jarrett fan might find helpful.<br /><br />1.  The best way to approach this set is as a complete unified unit. I don't feel one disc is better than any other.  You need to listen to the whole boxed set as a unified unit since this will give you the feeling of how the artist and his players were interacting over three consecutive nights.  I find this more pleasing than a one disc experience.<br /><br />2.  The complete set contains 40 songs with a total of 416.19 minutes of music (6.94 hours). I'm impressed that this much music recorded in the same venue is always fresh.  My wife is not and feels that there's too much \\"sameness\\" in the boxed set. That's probably because Jarrett's playing is always even and well-organized. (And she does not know what to listen for anyway . . . )<br /><br />3.  Jarrett's ability to keep things interesting is due to his fantastic ability to improvise the changes (that's different from improvising on the changes).  His subtle key changes, for me, keeps things lively and interesting.  I keep saying, \\"What more can he do to this song before ending?\\"  And sure enough he does something unexpected.<br /><br />4.  A couple ofthe tunes sequeway into another tune.  Since there's no break in the tape and no applause, one can easily think that this is an extention of the first tune where Jarrett has gone off into doing his own thing.  One can easily say, \\"Now where did this extention of the tune come from because it sounds totally unrelated to the track?\\"  After looking at the liner notes I then see it's another (Jarrett) composition, one usually built on a simple vamp.  I sort of wish that all the tunes were separated as stand-alone compositions with audience applause in between.<br /><br />5.  I cannot say this is one of ECM's better Jarrett recordings.  I guess this is due to the close confines of the Blue Note.  The drums do not sound up-front enough relative to Peacock's often booming base.  And the keyboard does not give off that usual sparkle that's characteristic of other Jarrett standards CDs (e.g., the Cure, which was recorded live in a large concert hall).<br /><br />6.  The packaging of the boxed set I received has some flaws.  The box itself was torn a bit and I was required to replace five of the six CD jewel boxes since they were cracked.  The biggest flaw is on disc II track 8.  There's a defect in the disc that causes a distinct sounding \\"crack.\\"  Luckily it occurs only once and it's during a DeJonette solo so it's not obvious. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning the whole box to Amazon.<br /><br />However, in general ECM could do a better job of quality control. For example, my Jarrett's The Cure has a serious defect that causes the last track to continually loop.  These CDs are cut in Germany and I would expect better from German engineering.  I'm going to replace my Cure with another copy since this is perhaps the best recorded Jarrett trio around.<br /><br />On the positive side is the fact that the six CDs are each packaged in a full jewel box; they are not jammed into some weird packaging arrangement as are many boxed sets.<br /><br />That's about it.If you are a Jarrett fan, this is a boxed set to have because you can hear the interplay between the players in a dynamic fashion.  The live audience is up close.  This adds to the fun.<br /><br />And it may not be available much longer.
B0053TMP24|5.0|When I had picked up the very first Percy Jackson book, my thoughts were that I was never gonna get into this series.  But as I read, I was so into the stories and characters of each book!  Could not put them down.  And this book continues on in it's awesomeness.  As usual, I loved Percy in this book.  Frank was a really cool character as well.  And even though Percy is my favorite character, I think Hazel stole the spotlight in this book.  Her life story was so interesting! I guess the only thing I didn't like about the book is the cliffhanger!!!! The Mark of Athena can't come soon enough!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the hoopla about this book, I thought \\"I just have to read it\\".  OMG, what a disappointment.  It honestly took me over 3 months to finish the book (I just finished today actually).  I jwas not interested in reading it consistently.  I would go weeks without picking it up.  Thank God I got a copy from a friend and did not buy it.  There was nothing spectacular about the book at all, matter of fact, it was quite boring actually.  Book 1 is overrated.  Eventually I will take a read at the other 2 books, but I am certainly not impressed with what I have read thus far.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Wahlberg is further proving to be an excellent actor. He carried the film throughout. Kate Mara also was completely believable and sympathetic; I was so glad that her character was not so stereotypically Hollywood into doing things that were not believable. Excellent pacing, well-told story. Could've used Rhona Mitra more; she was also great. And the FBI agent played by Michael Peña...well, I look forward to seeing more of him too. Just really well done all the way around.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard about the Bourne-less Bourne film, but when I went to the theatre and watched this film I was amazed. Jeremy Renner was a surprise as well and a pleasant one. I found myself wishing about half way through that they would stop talking about Bourne and get on with Aaron Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing's story.<br /><br />Aaron Cross' personality is anything but Bourne-like...He has a sense of humor for one that I enjoyed seeing. He has personality that doesn't involve whinging over his lost past. We get the rounded character from Cross that was missing in Bourne; Cross though lured in at first while at his most vulnerable goes into the program with open eyes and a true desire to serve his country. Over time he becomes disallusioned, but he still serves because that is who he is. However, he begins to see the writing on the wall and question the actions he is ordered to preform. All in all, I want more Aaron Cross and less Bourne in the next film.<br /><br />Dr. Marta Shearing is an intelligent woman blinded by science and naive enough to let that be her moral compass. She is the picture of many a successful woman who is on-point in the work place, but stumbling around in her private life. She isn't the normal Bourne-Chick being dragged around by the arm at every turn waiting for the hero to save her. She is strong enough to fight to survive at all costs. Rachel Weisz was the perfect choice for this roll and I hope that she continues with this franchise.<br /><br />There was an easy chemistry between these two, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, that compelled you to root not only for them to reach Manila and succeed but to care for each other.<br /><br />I hope they continue this story even with the Bourne tag, but I think that they could simply break-away and create deeper/darker more real Cross films.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Though I left my conservative christianity thirty years before, I hadn't settled in my mind the degree to which I was or was not a believer.  I had rejected \\"atheism\\" on valid grounds, based in a common understanding of the word.  Dr. Dawkins changed all that.  He offered a very sensible definition of belief in an engaged, personal god(s) as a continuum from \\"absolutely not\\" at one end (my traditional definition of atheism) to \\"absolutely yes\\" at the other, with important categories between.  His position (very likely not) matched my own and helped me make the long-overdue step to declare myself as a true unbeliever (in gods).  Further on, his thorough, reasoned treatment of various aspects of faith and reality, and of fair evidence made a compelling case for placing supernatural beliefs in their proper place, right beside other superstitions of the past.<br /><br />I have re-read this book at least four more times, and find it inspiring every time.  I would not be as activist in my unbelief, as he urges, but I appreciate his urging us to be more open in this regard, and more active in political implications.<br /><br />I now do not declare myself an atheist (though I am) for no other reason than that such a label doesn't describe what I believe, but what I don't believe.  And, in  my opinion, that is a meager substitute for answering someone's question about belief.  It is Richard Dawkins and his other books that have provided much of that answer, however.<br /><br />This book is a must-read.  So-called true believers will be angered, mostly because they have too much at stake in their religion to be open to change.  But anyone who is sincerely a believer in truth, that is, who is dedicated to believing what is true about the cosmos, will find this invigorating.  After all, if one believes something that is not true, some of us would like to know, and decide for ourselves.  Dr. Dawkins gives a very readable and respectable presentation of truth and the path along the way.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I started intimidated by the 1400 pages, and ended wishing there was 1400 pages more.  The usually abridged books Waterloo, Petit Picpus, and Intestines of Leviathan, though not necessary to the plot, are brilliant historical works in their own right.
0316066524|1.0|I thought I was cool three years ago when I purchased this book. Now I realize I was being nothing short of pretentious. There is a reader's guide you can buy to help you understand what you are reading, as  if the \\"infinite\\" number of footnotes at the back of the novel, which are really part of the work, isn't  bad enough--part of the \\"jest\\" if you will. Like Twain's \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\\" the author is playing a joke on you; that's what the \\"jest\\" is, namely, to waste your time in reading this, as the narrator, and of course you, as I've said, are tricked into; the difference between Twain and Wallace is that at least Twain's tale is short and can be finished. I don't think many, if any, can finish Wallace's work here-- perhaps that is what the title suggests, that you are not meant to finish it, but tricked into thinking that you can and/or that you will keep unendingly keep picking it up and putting it down. I have done this and I hope that I never will again pick it up. I don't want to part with it since I paid for it but because I still have it, I fear that I will succumb to the \\"jest\\" again. If I give it away, I might pass this trick, like chain mail, on to someone else. This is a difficult book to read: the syntax is awkward, voice, tone, mood, and the overall  style is bland. I've read close to three hundred pages including the corresponding footnotes, and I'm still waiting to laugh. The joke is on you the reader since the publisher, author, editors, etc are the ones who are laughing since they have taken your money.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had just bought my Kindle Fire and needed a cover for it. I just wanted something simple, reliable, and cheap. Then I found this item. I decided to buy it used (but looked new). When I finally got it I started to wonder if it could really protect my Kindle. I realized once I started my third year of college that I had made a good choice. Some other covers have to be completely removed from the Kindle to actually use it. With this cover all I have to do it move the flap out of the way and get to work. Also the flap cleans the screen of the Kindle. I notice every time I move the flap out of the way, the screen has little to no smudges on it. This also depends on where you store the Kindle. In my case I always put it in my purse. I guess because I take my purse just about anywhere, the flap on the cover moves which helps to wipe off the smudges. So basically the more you move, the more the cover cleans. Because of that I don't even need a cloth to clean off the screen. I have to say I'm really happy with my purchase.

It follows the life of a young village girl in PNG and her developing relationship with her teacher and MR PIP the story book character from Great Expectations. Whilst you do not go on any great adventure while reading, you feel as \\"if you are there\\" just as the girl is 'there' in the telling of stories.<br />It is an easy, comforting read, one you can put down then return to easily.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|A concept album, A concept album?, oh yes let me repeat that a CONCEPT album! When I heard that \\"Clockwork Angels\\" was going to be a concept album I felt a small shiver wiggle up spine. I was excited at the good news. Concept albums are right smack in the wheelhouse of this band and its progressive heritage. Neil writes terrific stories and the boys set them to inspiring and demonstrative musical compositions. To be honest all Rush does is concept work. Lately they have been individual concept songs rather than full cohesive concept albums. All Rush songs are based on a particular concept and then endeavors to make that concept come to life. Now we have news of the twentieth Rush studio album being a concept album. The prospects were very promising given the bands new-found progressive roots strategy coupled with the extreme level of musical proficiency they have developed over their forty-year career and now we toss in a classic Neil Peart penned concept. This is one recipe for potential glorious amazement.<br /><br />The trick to a concept album is to make your concept real and visible throughout all the songs but not to the point where the individual songs can not stand on their own. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is the closest to perfection on this point I have ever heard. Each one of the songs on this album is a self-contained chapter but still contributes to the larger story in a structured way. We follow our protagonist from the point he leaves the family farm on his adventure through carnivals, quests for lost cities, run ins with pirates and shadowy Anarchists figures all the way to the point in his life where he reflects back over his life's trials and tribulations. We learn about the protagonists point of view, thoughts, fears  and feelings about life, himself and how to treat others. The concept story is rich and full of adventure, wonder and personal revelations. There are just enough facts and key phrases to form a framework of a story within your head but then there is enough room to let your imagination run free to fill in the gaps to make your own personal adventure, setting and characters. This is exactly what a good novel does however Rush accomplish this feat with a very few select words and phrases and then adds the musical elements which help to spur the imagery within your own imagination.<br /><br />Neil draws on a number of literary and personal influences to help shape his story. \\"The Wreckers\\" is based on a story by Alfred Hitchcock's favorite author Daphne Du Maurier. The overall concept plot and more directly the song \\"The Garden\\" is influenced by Candide, a novel by Voltaire, where a Garden is used as an analogy for life. Freddie Gruber, the famed jazz drummer and teacher who recently passed inspired the lines and themes in \\"Headlong Flight\\", \\"I wish I could do it all again.\\" These are just but a few of the literary influences woven into the fabric of this concept. Neil fits these famous and well storied works of literature into the world of the modern science fiction genre of \\"Steampunk\\". The best way for me to help you visualize what Steampunk is all about is to have you watch the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. The ones with Robert Downey Jr. playing Holmes. The world is Victorian in style but with modern twists. Brass, leather and glass coupled with complex yet archaic gears power the Rube Goldberg style contraptions. It's an interesting genre and one that Rush have chosen to use as a backdrop for this story. Neil expertly melds the future world driven by the rigid Watchmaker along with these literary tales set to the dystopian world of Steampunk and still reveals useful life lessons along the way. Coupled with uber-virtuoso musical performances and you now have  a 2012 version of a Rush concept album that is mature, provocative and weighty.<br /><br />The stories, the concepts, the life lessons and the literature inspired the lyrics are all just gravy on the cupcakes. It's that signature music of Rush that makes a Rush album a RUSH album. After a healthy forty-year career these boys are masters of their individual instruments, that is a given, but to still be inspired to create like its your first album is what amazes me. Fresh melodies, interesting compositions, cool tones and some flat-out jaw dropping technical fireworks litter this album from start to finish. One characteristic of a Rush song or album is that it takes more than one listen to fully understand and appreciate the song. The music needs to breathe and age like a fine wine. It gets better with time. The more often you listen to a song the more you discover within that song. Subtle variations in rhythm, melody and/or arrangements of song sections continues to amaze and inspire. I enjoy focusing on one instrument during a particular listen of a song and try to follow that instruments journey from start to finish. Then compare that to the other instruments. It is a lot like three (or four counting synths and keys) instruments telling their own individual stories through variations in melody and rhythm but then all coming together in one intertwined amalgamation of sound that fits together in perfect lock step to achieve a singular purpose.<br /><br />I am not really that keen on ranking songs. I can never get the list right with a Rush album because songs shift in levels of enjoyment based my own perspectives, moods or the particular outlook of the day. I have however been able to group the songs on \\"Clockwork Angels\\" into four groups. My individual groupings as of now are as follows:<br /><br />(Songs in no particular order)<br />Top Group: Caravan, Carnies and Headlong Flight.<br />Second Group: BU2B, The Wreckers and The Garden.<br />Third Group: Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, Seven Cities of Gold and Wish Them Well.<br />Fourth Group: Halo Effect, BU2B2.<br /><br />The music of Rush is complex yet simple, deep yet accessible. It can be dark and it can be light. Emotions, feelings, scenarios, tastes, sights and smells are all present in the works. It is a modern symphony of three. In my opinion this album has all the elements I have described previously. It is a complete package of lyrics, music and concept spanning a variety of highs, lows, darks and lights. It is a complete story with a beginning, character development, an adventurous middle, a climax and a reflective ending. All told with amazing musical performances. In my opinion this is the best Rush album yet to be produced. Is it \\"Moving Pictures\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\"? No it is not. Those are similarly fantastic works of art but \\"Clockwork Angels\\" has something one step farther. The maturity of band members who have 55 plus years of life and 40 plus years of musical maturity under their collective belts. To me those experiences and maturities are crucial elements in the depth and fabric of this album. I felt those elements were present and growing in the past few albums but it has now come together with full force. The progressive roots music, the high quality concept and the knowledgeable direction of a true fan as a producer has elevated the overall atmosphere of this album.<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is the perfection (as in \\"highest degree of excellence\\") of the fifth and most complete incarnation (as in \\"being or form\\") of Rush.<br /><br />Read more about it at TheLoftyOaks[dot]com

Please, please promise me that Robert Downey, Jr. will soon be coming out with a third Sherlock Holmes movie.  The script, the acting the role that the music played in conveying thoughts, emotions and anticipation all were wonderful and I feel like a pathetic Oliver Twist compelled to beg, \\"Please, sir, may I have more?\\"

1468161660|1.0|I found this book terribly disappointing.  I have no idea why there are so many rave reviews! Yes the book is about about a couple who hit it off quickly and form a strong bond and then find out that there is reason that they can't be together, this happens fairly early in the book. After this it is  deathly boring. The book limps along going around in circles but nothing actually happens. I kept reading in the hope that something would happen but it didn't.  Then comes the completely predictable end.  Don't waste your money...

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'd just like to say it was worth every single cent spent on Mikes books, the \\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\" Book is not just making my body strong, but it has given my a strong and smarter mind about bodybuilding. I highly suggest reading this book. Let me just put it like this.<br />You may think you know everything about bodybuilding and getting fit. But seriously, I'm a 16 year old boy who knows more than personal trainers at the gymss I have gone to. I find it absolutely hilarious hearing them giving false information to people with fat pockets.<br /><br />I have given the information to my friends that are now at the gym. They have the results of a god. The figures they now have are just hard, ripped, solid bodies. This book is the most biggest eye opener and i suggest buying it!!<br /><br />- Timothy Samoilov
B003RRY60S|5.0|This Doctor Who is one of the best I have ever read! Rose and the Doctor travel back to ancient Rome to find out why there is a marble statue of Rose inside a museum. Once there, they get caught in this huge mystery. Basicly the premise of this story is &#34;Be careful what you wish for.&#34; Don't get it? I am not telling anymore. But I will say this: Buy the book! The story concept was absolutely brilliant and the history was so exact. I suppose since I am only thirteen I don't know much about good books, but this is such a good book. Read it! If you love Doctor Who, you will love this book!
B008JAG2AA|3.0|rarely are sequels as good as the original and this is no different.. some funny moments.. was good to see the whole cast on this one.. wouldn't ever buy the dvd but the rental was certainly worth it if you were a fan of the original.

B004SBQGHS|2.0|In what way does a pop up box for the Aulani Hotel floating above pigs on each &amp; every level equal &quot;ad free&quot;? How does Rovio define ad free? Does it just mean no one shows up at your doorstep with products in hand...  This is the same as the regular Angry Birds. Don't pay for this release if you're looking for ad free or if you want to retain the level you've reached already. You'll be back to ground zero.

B00181YT9S|5.0|I have these as my PC desktop speakers, using the S/PDIF input.  They are a bit large, but they are solid and worth the space.<br /><br />I was considering the MS40, but I'm glad I went with the smaller and cheaper MS20.  Plenty of power.  Sound is excellent, and as mentioned before it sounds best with both treble and bass knobs at 10 o'clock.  At loud volumes the tweeters can be harsh.  Bass is surprisingly good for speakers this size.<br /><br />Standby consumption with power on is about 8 watts, I was hoping for less but not as bad as my old Klipsch at 19 watts.
B003UESJHO|4.0|Overall a lot better than I anticipated.<br />True story follows two brothers, both boxers, admist family drama when one of them decides to go out on his own.<br />Great variety of characters, good solid story, excellent cast, good pacing.  I was impressed.<br />Another reviewer suggested \\"Warrior\\", which also an excellent movie, and similar to this movie, no doubt. But this movie did a much better job portraying emotional drama and baggage between the family.<br />I would buy this movie for my library.

0756405890|5.0|Being so impressed and absolutely enthralled with Michael J. Sullivan's Riyeria Series, who better to ask for a recommendation for my next read?  So, that's exactly what I did, and the result was The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />The more I read good quality epics, the better I like them, and appreciate the skill, talent and creativity it takes to write them.  It's no easy task creating a whole new universe.  God himself found it so tiresome of a job He rested after every six days. Unfortunately, there are many who fall flat on their faces in their attempts to create successful epics, but I'm learning that it's not so much these authors had a lack of imagination, but more of a lack of patience and discipline.  I've been extremely blessed these past few months to have come across some really great epic writers and truly wonderfully crafted stories, part of me keeps wondering when the other shoe is going to drop.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is an excellent example of the masterful strokes of a truly talented story weaver.  For those who've followed my reviews for a time, you know how I'm more drawn to character-centered and character-driven stories.  My favorite writing/reading style is active/third-person.  Too many times I find that stories written in first person are often pregnant with too much telling and not enough natural character and story development.  Nothing irks me more than a character that \\"knows it all  (no offense to Kvothe and his genius intellect)- knows the right things to say - always makes the right decisions - and always saves the day\\". Kvothe is full of mistakes, wild with fears and though highly intelligent, he's highly naive. That's awesome!  A character that has plenty of room to grow???  Wow!  What a concept.  (Please note the dripping pools of sarcasm).<br /><br />I love fantasy, not faery tales (my apologies to all fae).  Saying all of that, I was a bit weary of diving into a story, being told by one of the characters, however, this is why I call Rothfuss a masterful weaver, because somehow this author was able to keep this story engaging, active and spell binding.  I know those terms are overused by other writers in the industry, especially when it comes to the marketable blurb, but in this instance, it is the simple truth.<br /><br />While the `present day' part of the story is engaging, interesting, had me asking a million questions, it wasn't until Kote started telling his story with young Kvothe, that I was not only intellectually, but emotionally absorbed into this story.  The little, street rat has pick-pocketed my heart.  His song calls out, not just to be heard, but to be felt and remembered.  The way he yearned for knowledge, music, and magic felt so familiar, and so daunting at the same time, I am forever hooked.<br /><br />This is a story, for story-tellers.  I believe Rothfuss' greatest praise will come from other writers like me, because this story is the story of a story-weaver, told by a story-weaver.  I feel like I know this character, as well as I know myself.<br /><br />So, thank you Michael J. Sullivan for your recommendation of this series.  This was a good one.  I would definitely recommend it to others.<br /><br />Till next time,<br />~T.L.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|It is an awesome game to keep mind busy and variety when u replay eeach time recommend it to all
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Very happy with the album. I have to say that while it definitely sounds like Five Finger Death Punch, I feel that they have moved a bit from a diverse sound on earlier albums (for example, contrast Never Enough with The Bleeding) to one album length song. This is not a bad thing- I enjoy the music a lot- but if one is inclined to be critical of \\"repetitive\\" music you might want to preview the album first.<br /><br />I would recommend the album, and hope that if you do pick it up that you enjoy it.
0679746323|5.0|This book is he most startling book I have ever read. It carefully, with great detail and original source material, outlines the rise and tyrannical rule of a man I consider to be the most vile human who ever breathed air. It is estimated he was directly responsible for 80 million (that's right, I said 80 million) peacetime deaths. In one period between 1958 and 61 he oversaw the starvation and suicide of 38 million \\"peasants\\" in China. He knew all about his own people's being forced to eat dirt, tree bark and grass roots while he created forced labor camps for the entire rural population of 500+ million people, all to obtain enough grain and food to trade to Russia for assistance with nuclear tenchology and rocket capabilities.<br /><br />I see so many parallels to what we see today in the USA, although in smaller expressions. Begin by demonizing the \\"wealthy\\" and  any who disagree, then making promises to the masses, creating dependencies on government, subtly changing the rule of law and focusing it in a handful of individuals, and celebrating things like Occupy Wallstreet, which is little more than socialism 101.  Small seeds, but identical to the socialist play book perfected by Stalin and Mao.<br /><br />Mao never cared one bit for the workers, or for that matter, the Communist movement. It was all about him using turmoil and terror to literally rule the world. He cared only about himself and used fear, torture, starvation and terror to subdue the masses. He manipulated every circumstance and every individual to gain his objective, China as a world class nation, with him as the head of the communist movement international.<br /><br />A wonderful book by any standard. Too bad more don't read it and understand how fortunate we are that  this man is worm food.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I was torn going into this.  How can you turn the game into a movie?  Superbly done, excellent movie, just had poor timing in the box office.
B0036D7Y34|3.0|The performance is first rate, but the sound engineering leaves a lot to be desired. It requires constant turning up and turning down of the sound volume, because of the variable sound engineering.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|This is a very long film but never seems slow or boring.  It concerns, among other things, the life and times of a privileged, sensitive and highly educated adolescent, and the life-changing events that befall her in and around Manhattan's Upper West Side.  Many parenting, political, legal  and moral issues are explored along the way, with highly satisfying results. Although many of the \\"Big names\\" (Matthew Broderick, Mark Ruffalo, Matt Damon) have very small cameo roles, you should still see it!

1401232590|5.0|I was a little skeptical about reading Jeph Loeb's work at first because while many of his works have been praised (BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN, SUPERMAN FOR ALL SEASONS, and SPIDER-MAN: BLUE), I've seen quite a bit of criticism against some of his other works (ULTIMATES 3, ULTIMATUM, and RED HULK), and that got me a little worried about reading his stories. But I had heard that this was considered one of the greatest Batman stories of all time, and the plot sounded really awesome to me so I decided to take the chance with this comic and try it out.<br /><br />And guess what...<br />IT WAS A SPECTACULAR, AND THRILLING STORY!!!! JUST AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />The story takes place six months after BATMAN: YEAR ONE, where Batman forms an alliance with Police Captain James Gordon, and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Their mission is to bring down organized crime in Gotham City for good without breaking the law in anyway. Their main target is Carmine &#34;The Roman&#34; Falcone, a mobster whose crime family has an iron grip on the corrupt city. But apparently Batman and Gotham's finest are not the only ones trying to bring down &#34;The Roman.&#34; On Halloween night, Falcone's nephew Johnny Vitti is mysteriously shot by an unknown assassin while taking a bath. The killer left his gun (which had the serial number filed off and the handle tapped), a baby bottle nipple, which he used as a crude silencer, and a jack-o-lantern at the scene of the crime. The killer was later dubbed as &#34;Holiday&#34; by the newspapers, as he killed more of Falcone's men on each holiday and left his weapon and a relic of that holiday at the crime scene. This leads Batman to not only focus on bringing down the mob, but also on stopping Holiday, whose crime spree eventually leads to the downfall of Harvey Dent, and the birth of Two-Face! And the true identity of Holiday will surprise all of you!!!<br /><br />Jeph Loeb did an amazing job on this! The story is very complex and the mystery of Holiday is set up so well that it gives you a thrilling urge to keep on reading to find out more! The writing is really good as well because it follows almost perfectly with what happened in BATMAN: YEAR ONE and brings back some of the same characters and events from its story (Falcone tried to kill Johnny Vitti for failing to kill Gordon's son, Barbra Gordon is still getting over the fact that her husband cheated on her, and Falcone has the scar on his face from when Catwoman scratched him). Jeph also puts a lot of emotion into events leading to Dent's downfall, sets it up to where all of Batman's foes are represented by their elemental symbols (the usual rouges gallery appearing on particular holidays relating to their characteristics), and makes references to the media by having the Joker recite the Grinch while stealing people's presents on Christmas Eve (just hilarious)! This story makes me want to read more of Jeph Loeb's works like BATMAN HUSH and SPIDER-MAN: BLUE!!!<br /><br />This book actually inspired Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT, and while reading this masterpiece, I saw that many of the themes in this book correlated with the movie (the roof top scene with Batman, Gordon, and Dent, the downfall of the mob, and how Holiday creates anarchy in Gotham City)! That's how great this tale is!!! Jeph Loeb allows us to see Batman's inner thoughts, which not only makes the story flow, but also makes us feel as if we were actually looking into the dark knight's mind. Tim Sale's artwork gives a noir and twenties feel to the story, which perfectly fits in with Batman's early days and the mafia that he is fighting. THE LONG HALLOWEEN has become one of my personal favorites in the Batman mythos, as story starts with an alliance trying to bring good to a corrupted city, and swiftly transforms itself into an engrossing and haunting tragedy when Batman suffers one of the most brutal defeats in his career.<br /><br />&#34;You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.&#34;<br />-Harvey Dent and Batman from THE DARK KNIGHTatman from THE DARK KNIGHT
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Have read most of David Baldacci's books but this one seems to have held my interest throughout the entire book. I finished reading the book in a very short time just so I could read more as to how this mystery would be solved. I will be reading more of this author's books in the future.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This is a great album with many wonderful pieces by John Williams, they are beautifully conducted and would be great for anyone that enjoys movie themes.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|This movie, I must admit, didn't totally wow me, though it did have a pretty original idea behind it.  The acting was decent, though I wouldn't call it top notch.  I won't say much about the movie, because there's a description on the movie's page already, plus I wouldn't want to spoil anything further either.  I liked the movie okay, though I don't think I'd own it.  I'd say it's worth at least a watch though.  Check it out.
B008645YEE|5.0|Great album!!! The music is moving and Zimmer really out-did himself on this one. Definitely my favorite soundtrack from the triolgy.
B005LAIGKU|5.0|This is a 90 minute movie, so I'll try to scale my comments accordingly.<br /><br />I expected the typical \\"action\\" cliche`s with this movie, lots of car<br />wrecks, guns, explosions, that sort of thing. Premium Rush has almost<br />zero of that, literally.<br /><br />Instead, it has its own definition of \\"action\\", where it invites you<br />to try to imagine yourself, physically, in the role of the character.<br />The sweat, the fatigue, the momentary panic, the impact, the pain.<br /><br />As an essay on how to make a very good movie without a lot of money,<br />Premium Rush basically says \\"simplify\\". So in addition to action,<br />it also has a plot which I found to be direct, interesting, and even<br />realistic.<br /><br />For me, a lot of the realism comes from the character development of<br />the bad guy, impressively played by Michael Shannon. Again, the bad<br />guy avoids all the cliche`s I expected. Instead, he's a bad guy with<br />enough \\"ordinary\\" qualities to make him realistic. He knows he has<br />personality and character problems, he knows he is definitely not a<br />good guy, but he also knows he is in a *lot* of trouble. His survival<br />is at stake, and frankly, he really is having a very bad day. Bad bad.<br />But he believes he has a chance to survive it, and he does everything<br />he can to do so.<br /><br />I would describe the development of the other characters as efficient<br />and compact, well-crafted for the length of the movie, the production<br />cost, and the emphasis on action and a direct plot. These people are<br />a lot like people you can find in the real world, and their lives don't<br />have complex backstories. They're just a little crazy, that's all.<br /><br />There are very few humorous moments in this movie, but again, the best<br />laugh came scripted from an unexpected source, and I found myself<br />relating to the character it was directed at.<br /><br />All in all, a very good movie. I'm not consistent when it comes to 4<br />stars versus 5 stars, but I give Premium Rush 5 stars because I think<br />it does a great job of accomplishing its goals.
034580404X|5.0|Book one is very discriptive but needed to have a great plot for book two and three. Very good reading.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I usually enjoy David Baldacci's books and they keep me riveted. This one didn't. I agree with another reviewer who said the book got bogged down. . . for me, it was trying to keep all the various characters' roles and positions in the military straight. The story line lagged, and the whole ending was for me, predictable. Of course Puller saved the world but he couldn't save the people who helped him save the world. I will skip the subsequent Puller books.
1400095204|2.0|I appreciate that this book has an afrocentric point of view and we're able to get a glimpse into the life of 1960 era Nigerians. Also, I appreciated some of the conversations that took place in the book. In particular, there was a convo about why Africans like to refer to themselves by Tribe rather than by nation. Chimamanda is also a great writer, I will give that to her. However, that's where my adoration ends.<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars because it is simply boring. There wasn't much suspense or anxiety that spanned the entire 440 pages I read. Yeah I know its 546 pages. I gave the book ample time to get its s*it together but I just couldn't finish it.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|this app is good if you want to listen to music less than half of the time you acctually open this app. I constantly have to shut down my kindle to be able to get it to work right for a few minutes. it needs plenty of updates. hope none of you people out there have this problem, but if you do you understand my frustration.
B0001XPZGA|3.0|This is a really good album, however the quality of the vinyl record (little over 100 grams of vinyl) was fairly poor for today's standard. The record didn't come with a plastic sleeve, just a paper one with a hole to see the label. Other records i've bough came with an anti-static sleeve offering much more protection.
B0084RSYEK|1.0|Though I am a Hugh Eddie Murphy fan I would not recommend this movie. There was too much cursing and too many adult situations for the PG-13 rating.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My 6 year old grandson has been obsessed with Angry Birds for years. He has had Birthday Parties with this theme, he wears it, this is his bedroom  decoration and he plays it whenever he can.  But it is not just for kids this is a really fun game for any age, we all love playing it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|'Gone Girl' is not exactly a gripping novel though it is entertaining and piques ones curiosity, so in spite of the fact that you may find it starting to sound really far fetch and bordering on the ridiculous, you want to continue reading to see where it goes next.<br /><br />The story started out rather interesting but it wasn't hard for me to figure out what actually happened to Amy.  Like I said, it started out as an interesting story but unfortunately, the writer apparently didn't know how to end the book, lost enthusiasm and came up with an end that I was not impressed with.  It was quite blas&eacute;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool omnibus is pure delight. One of the best pieces of sci fi I read in the last few years. It was so engaging that I simply couldn't put my Kindle down, and when it was over I had that empty feeling you have when you just parted with something great and you know it's over.<br /><br />What's amazing about Wool omnibus, which is a collection of 5 short volumes (Wool 1 to Wool 5) spanning a single story arc that just gets better and better, is that it gives you a false sense of simplicity and then grabs you deeper and deeper down an ingenious twisting plot that shatters all of your previous assumptions one by one.<br /><br />You hardly notice it at first, but as the pages turn you realize you got attached to the heroes so much that you're basically glued to them like the Millennium Falcon to a Death Star tractor beam. They fight against great unseen forces, and as the novel progresses you find out just how much was hidden from them. You'll identify with their cause so much that you'll want to send a virtual hand into the book to help them out.<br /><br />Wool has an extremely powerful discovery element, and I often found myself wide-eyed or smiling as the truth began to unravel. It's a fantastic feat of authorship when you pull these sort of emotions out of an eBook reader.<br /><br />Hugh says he reads all new reviews. So let me raise you a toast, Hugh, and say that you've achieved a remarkable thing.
1568363931|5.0|For a little bit of background, I can cook meals that people think are delicious but I'm no master chef.  I have a few cookbooks but I'm collector.  However, this book is everything I was looking for in making bentos and more!  I've been a long-time follower on her blog at JustBento.com and when buying my bentos, decided to buy this book on a whim.  A lot of her recipes are things you can find on her website, but it's presented in such a way that doesn't make it intimidating for beginners.  Maki doesn't only give you a list of recipes, but a way to present it and a bunch of varieties (for the mini burgers, there are about 5 different varieties including one that involved canned tuna).  Another great thing is that almost all of the recipes involve ingredients that can be easily found in the states (provided that you live close to an Asian store) and are pretty budget-conscious.  I absolutely love the presentation and versatility of this book.  Can you find a lot of the info on her website?  Yes, but the book just has everything together so nicely.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so wonderful and easy for our young boys to play. it has the mini games and movies to watch for added entertainment. it keeps them focused on a level that I can actually get dinner made without worrying where they are.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Finally a game similar to Media city's Mystery of the Crimson Manor and Fire Maple Games' The lost City and The Secret of Grisley Manor.  I have bought several mystery adventures by other companies and have been very disappointed.  I do not like hidden picture games which seem to be what the others are.  In this one, you find objects and then figure out how to use them to solve puzzles, open doors, etc.  I love these type of games.  Good job.
B001A3AA0G|4.0|So this album isn't new. I purchased this shortly after purchasing Fleet Foxes more recent album Hopelessness Blues. Most of the songs have very strong vocal melodies and harmonies. The instrumental accompaniment is very simple so as to not distract from the lead singer. In particular, I feel like the transition in Ragged Wood around the 3 minute mark is the highlight of the album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Literally could not put this book down!  The whole series is wonderful, recommend to anyone except children :) My husband just started the first book!
B004X0XA82|5.0|I purchased this album mainly for the single that's available free on their website. Although I was initially disappointed I had done so, I made the right choice in doing so. Fleet Foxes is very talented and it shows through the great evolution of sound from Fleet Foxes to Helplessness Blues. Grown Ocean and The Shine/An Argument are the other great highlights on this album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is a great story and very captivating. I love having it on my kindle device so I can have all<br />Three books together with no weight!
B00932A2MC|2.0|Plot? nope. Character development? nope. Things blowing up? yep.<br /><br />Willing suspension of disbelief is severely tested in this one. Aliens are basically the same as the aliens in Independence Day, albeit a little less goopy. One scene featuring a captured alien is pretty much stolen from ID:4. The Mighty Mo still has live ordnance on board??<br /><br />One redeeming quality: Every time Brooklyn Decker runs, it seems the camera angle changes to get a bouncy cleavage shot.<br /><br />overall an amusing 2hr diversion, provided you don't have high expectations.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I learned of this phenomenon from my wellness medical doctor in California on the Central Coast.  I certainly think this is worth eliminating from one's diet for a few months to determine if it could be a cause of a host of health issues.  ccc
1476712042|5.0|This book is exciting from the very beginning. I love that Abby is trying to enjoy her new life and live a little. I also like that she can read people very well. Travis actually knows that she is not the typical college girl just looking for a pretty face. The most frustrating part of this book for me was how stubborn Abby and Travis are; that is what makes them a powerful couple however. There is a lot of tension throughout the book between America/Sheply and Abby/Travis and Abby/her past and it is good that Abby and America's history is introduced slowly. It is a rollercoaster of a ride reading this one, but well worth the lack of sleep. I couldn't put it down and can't wait for Walking Disaster next April. Everyone says that guys are not complicated and I'm very excited to see how Travis views their relationship.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing Solitaire to kill time (at doctor's office, etc.) and often play while listening to mp3s my phone.  The stupid video adds that pop up between games are very annoying, first because they cause my music player to turn off and second because an unexpected add on my screen making noise is unpleasant.  After the bothersome add, I have to go to my mp3 player and hit play, then go back to my solotaire game.  Not a big deal once, but between multiple games in a row this gets old very quickly!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Most people understand that if you read a book before you see the movie, the movie tends to disappoint. This is the complete opposite.  Most people who disliked the movie haven't read the book.<br /><br />I don't know why I chose to read the book first, but I did.  The insight that I got into the characters from the book made me truly appreciate the subtle details that the performers delivered. They did an amazing job.<br /><br />It wasn't perfect, but I truly enjoyed the film.  I recommend that you read the book first, maybe even the complete series, before you watch.

0307744434|5.0|I have to admit it was the cover that caught my eye. The title intrigued me and I really wanted to find out what was going on inside this book. I was quickly swept off my feet and into the story. The story is told from several different angles which makes it all the more interesting. I am almost done with the book and I am really sad because I want to keep reading. This says a lot about the book because most books I read can't keep my attention like this one. I would suggest this book to anyone and everyone.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|Well, i don't have that many reasons, but i did love this book.  The first couple of pages didn't inspire me but after that I was hooked.  I am having trouble sleeping at the moment and woke up at 1.45am.  It's now 5.08am and I've just finished the book...didn't fall asleep and am so energized i've just bought the next in the series and am writing a review for this one!<br />If you are looking for q quirky romance/mystery...try this book!  Great price and a great read.

0307592731|2.0|I swore off Oprah picks a long time ago but after watching Cheryl Strayed on a \\"Soul Sunday\\" segment, I felt compelled to read this story.  \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" it is NOT.  Though the writing is decent enough to get through it, this is a tedious, repetitious story that was boring and really just STRANGE. It was shocking to see someone so ill prepared for such a journey.  Strayed (on odd, hand picked name) did not really prepare the reader as to WHY she really made the trip in the first place, in my opinion.  I did not glean any glowing insights from the book except for the fact that if I hiked the PCT, I would buy shoes that FIT and not carry more than I need!  Silly book with not much substance.  I have no doubt Strayed learned a lot from her experience but she did not translate whatever it was to the reader.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|The First word that comes to mind for this film is Amazing!  This film was well shot and the story while about some of the best food in the world, was about a much deeper topic than food.  It is still just fascinating to watch.  This will be purchased and then handed down to my children once they are old enough to \\"get it\\" in my opinion.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love everything about this movie. The cinematography, the retro-feel of the musical score, the story, the acting, the adventure.  I haven't met one person who has seen this movie that hasn't liked or loved it.  The marketing and the media were just terrible.  I hope this movie becomes a cult classic and one that has enough momentum to spur multiple sequels.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Ghost Rider two was pretty much what I expected as the adventures of Johnny Blaze restarts in Europe it once again matches Johnny against an ultimate evil force.  The movie was pretty predictable and Nicholas Cage was his usual emotionless monotone characature.  The movie moves fast enough and the special effects are much like the first movie. If you liked the first Ghost Rider you will like this one, just don't expect too much because it is more of the same kicked up a notch.

0062124293|3.0|The book doesn't start well for me. I was really looking forward to reading it, but starting off with menstruation, bodily hair, breasts and bras? I wasn't interested. I know I've got it all, I don't need to be reminded.<br /><br />Really only when the book started to mention fashion (followed by babies), I started to get interested, because Moran had some sensible things to say about this, of the kind where you say: \\"Me too! Me too\\".<br /><br />It's amazing I even lasted until the Fashion chapter, as it's about 2/3rds down the book and I really wanted to give up much earlier. Why I lasted this long? Maybe because it had some funny bits. Laugh out loud funny bits. It wasn't funny at all time, but it had some great moments.<br /><br />What I also liked is how Moran argues that feminism isn't about burning bras and being allowed to work (etc.), but about wearing underwear that fits (rather than being too small and sexy, for the unlikely occasion that today is the day that you'll meet that guy and you end up undressing - as if he cares about your underwear anyway! He's just happy to have got you into bed!) and about the right not to work if that's what you and your family prefer.<br /><br />What I didn't like? Maybe the personal accounts were too long for me. I didn't know Moran before this book so I didn't have this \\"nice woman, let's read her book and find out more about her\\" kind of attitude when I started the book. I knew it was funny, and that is was about women, but not much more than that.<br /><br />It didn't make a lasting impression on me, but some women may find this an inspiring book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought it to maintain my new Seal Pup Elite, but that knife was so sharp it came out of the box on its own (not really)! However, it did do a great job turning my dull clasp Shrade knife into such a sharp knife that I accidentally cut myself (I could do that before if I'd tried). So, thanks a lot, Smith!<br /><br />The carbide is helpful too for fixing dull blades, and did well on hatchet.<br /><br />It also fits perfectly into the pouch on my Seal Pup Elite's sheath. That's a bonus.
0061726834|5.0|The idea of this at first sounded a lot to me like \\"Eternal Sunspot for the Forgotten Mind\\", to erase the hurts of loves lost and all that; but the premise is actually much more heartbreaking.  For the \\"Cure\\" of this Dystopian Society not only takes away love, it takes away all emotions and feelings it would seem, even the love a parent has for their children, passion for music, hatred for suffering and wrongdoing, injustice itself.  This so-called \\"Cure\\" makes everyone indifferent, and right away I noticed similarities between \\"Delirium\\" and Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" series, both with these crazy Societies out to change everyone in them to conform to their ways, with these outsiders, in this case \\"Invalids\\" living in the \\"Wilds\\", in the \\"Uglies\\" series it was the 'Uglies' themselves living castoff from the \\"Pretties\\".  But make no mistake, this is no rip-off of Westerfeld's world, this is a whole new world of Oliver's own making, a world scary and horrid and beautiful all at the same time.<br /><br />Lena is fast approaching her 18th birthday, and the day of her operation in which she will be cured, paired, and sent off to College to begin the rest of her life.  This is what everyone does in Portland and the rest of the U.S.A.  She knows she will miss her best friend Hana, will even forget the feelings she has for her and the memories they have made growing up together, but also she knows it is just a part of becoming an adult.  She certainly wishes she could hurry along her days, God forbid she come down with the sickness before then!  Meanwhile, Hana has been downloading forbidden music (she reminds me a lot like Shay also in the \\"Uglies\\" series, for she introduces Lena to this forbidden fruit), and starts to go to ellicit, outlawed parties at night, with uncured boys and music not on the approved lists.  Lena follows, if only to prove Hana wrong, and finds that she loves the beat of this new music.  There she runs into Alex, a boy they met once before, (and truthfully Lena saw him even before that).  Alex is a beautiful boy, eyes of honey, hair of golden and brown curls like fallen leaves; everything you need to know from the beginning that he is the one to capture Lena's heart, to seize her with this sickness they speak of.<br /><br />So like this, we tumble forth with Lena, as she fights herself and the disease called love, then rushes back to Alex and back to reality.  It is a beautiful love story unlike any before it unless you can perhaps compare it to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", and many references are made to the classic play.  Theirs is a love unrivaled, and fought for, and you, like me, will not be able to put this book down until the very end, no matter your age.  I am 33, and I couldn't bear to part with it.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.  I may compare it slightly to the \\"Uglies\\" series, as it reminds me in bits here and there of it, but I fell so much more in love with the characters and the storyline, which I will admit I found much less shallow, and no offense to \\"Uglies\\" which I also loved.  I loved this book, in the way I so passionately love so few books these days.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  THIS IS a MUST read.  5 stars +++++++ly Lena saw him even before that).

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'll  be the first to admit that young adult books are my not so guilty pleasure.  After purchasing my eReader, Slammed was the first book I bought.  I began and finished it the same day.  I was instantly consumed by the characters and story.  After reading several YA books this summer I couldn't help but compare them to Slammed.<br />Slammed is Colleen Hoover's first novel, which made it to the New York Times best seller list.  She is a mother of three and was researching slam poetry during her son's school play rehearsal when she got the idea for her best seller. The title gets its name from slam poetry, the reciting of personal poems with the use of rhythm and dramatic infliction on key words.  After looking for a book with a slam poet as the main character her search turned up empty, so she began writing Slammed.<br /> While there is a budding romance that will make you want to fall in love too, there is more depth to the story.  The main character, Layken, is forced to move to Michigan with her mother and younger brother after the unexpected death of her father.  Once Layken sets foot in Michigan her whole life spirals out of control.<br /> My favorite thing about Hoover's writing is that it's realistic. Layken's hope for a boyfriend is set on the backburner while she deals with the unexpected turns her life is taking.  Will, the subject of her affection, is a positive male character in the book.  The story involves both characters and several \\"almost\\" moments in their relationship.  But, life always gets in the way and prohibits the two from actually being a couple.<br /> Slammed is a story about being forced to become an adult at a young age.  Through friends and slam poetry Layken learns to cope with the fact that not everything goes the way you want it to.  Hoover does a great job of expressing the emotions of a teenager going through a constant stream of life changing experiences. I never faced any of the challenges Layken faces, but if I did, I think I'dbe feeling the same way Hoover describes.<br /> My only complaint is that the book seemed to take on a gloomy feel.  Every time the characters finally get over a disappointment, another one is waiting on the next page.  I get that it's a tale of growing up, but enough is enough.  I felt so sorry for Layken that I was almost to the point of depressed, I cried on several occasions.  That being said, the book isn't completely disheartening.  There were also moments when I was laughing out loud.  Slammed made me more emotional than any book ever has.<br />As soon as I finished Slammed I wanted to rest my eyes, but as soon as I realized there was a sequel I knew it wouldn't happen.  I immediately purchased Point of Retreat and finished it at 5:00 in the morning.  It didn't disappoint.  It was just as heartwarming and entertaining as Slammed.  I would recommend the duo to readers who love a good teen love story.  The forbidden romance aspect of the story fits well with Tammara Webber's book Easy.  They both have a Romeo and Juliet feel, but without the family rivalry.

0393327345|4.0|I'd seen the movie. Loved the movie. Probably quoted the movie to an annoying degree back in the day. And I'd always meant to read the book, but I was a little nervous about it because when I love a movie first, I tend not to enjoy the book as much. Not this time, I'm pleased to say. In fact, I think this is case where both movie and book stand on their own -- each doing cool things within their own storytelling format. And that's enough about the movie!<br /><br />The actual writing, on a technical level, was pretty awesome. The repetition of phrases and sentences, the bare-minimum sketching in of setting, the detailed lists of things (furniture, plants, how-to's) pulled me deeply into the isolated world of the narrator and kept me there. And I liked the way we bounced from scene to scene, not necessarily in linear order. Again, it felt like I was experiencing some of the exhausted confusion the narrator was going through.<br /><br />What was interesting (for me, anyway) was when I first started reading, I felt like this story caught all the cynicism of my generation. This was me in college. But as I kept reading I decided \\"Fight Club\\" isn't really limited to one generation or time period. It's, weirdly enough, a coming-of-age story. It's finishing the assigned check-list of adolescence and early adulthood and asking \\"so what's next?\\" and either not getting an answer or realizing that the answer given is so much bullshit. Which is probably what makes the book so dark (much darker than the movie). If there's no answer then, Tyler Durden.

B008GOAFBQ|4.0|The sound quality of this alone is worth the purchase.  The \\"Sweet Pain\\" w/ original guitar solo bonus track is the version we know & love & it's apparently NOT remixed.  The version they put in the regular flow of things is Ace's solo & I must say they should've just left it the way it was.<br />As a whole, the bass sounds fantastic; very beefed-up & the drums are more up front as well.  The entire album sounds much more layered as opposed to the compression of the original mix.  The remix has \\"expanded the spectrum.\\"  The kids are much more audible in \\"God Of Thunder\\", making it more eerie than before.  You can hear acoustic guitar in the beginning of \\"Beth\\", the harmony guitars more in \\"King Of The Nighttime World\\" and much more separation of all the ingredients.  Best experienced on a higher-quality stereo to really get the effect.  The \\"noisy haze\\" that follows \\"Do You Love Me\\" has been separated into a track of its own so you don't have to have it or hear it if you don't want it.  To me, \\"Flaming Youth\\" sounds a little different at the start & you may notice a couple of things you don't remember being there, but overall, if they had just left the regular \\"Sweet Pain\\" in its place, I'd give this five stars.  It is Destroyer, after all.  Da' Wolf

B004SBQGHS|5.0|great FAOTD! this game plays great on kindle fire. and it is totally ad-free except for (between levels) ads for other angry birds products. these you can make disappear by pressing pause, which brings up all the ads in a sort of list. you can make these disappear by pressing the pig in the lower right-hand corner. and poof! they're gone. if people are seeing ads besides these, they must be accidentally still playing the free version. as for losing all your progress, i can't address that because i had no progress to begin with.  but this is a great game which looks gorgeous and runs flawlessly on my kindle.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Just another stupid predictive programing movie to glorify the military as an honorable and fun place to be when in fact this day and age it is nothing more than a bunch of idiots and thugs avoiding jail who do the bidding for the 1% to be able to steal resource from third world nations and sell weapons since that's Americas only export now. This movie is ridiculous predictive programing to their planned \\"Project Blue Beam\\". Hollywood You Suck!
0307200477|1.0|The comb binding is not  effective. It came off the cover before the baby even saw it. The original, smaller version lasted for years. This is a big waste of money. Very disappointed.
B004G600A4|1.0|The movie is great, no problems there. But it went straight from the box to the computer and I even tried it on a DVD player and it skips. Another person in this house had a copy that skipped as well, and I've played plenty of other DVD's on these that did not skip. I'm going to try to get a replacement for the defective disk. I also looked online some people who purchased the DVD from Amazon, Walmart and the Disney Store also had the same problem. :/
B005N7CA3A|5.0|I really like this CD...but like everything Darren Hayes has done...evenv when he was half of Savage Garden. I am never disappointed in his songwriting or singing......I have all his stuff. amazon rocks! never had any problem with anything I've bought there.
0765350386|4.0|Overall Mistborn was a rewarding read. The premise immediately drew me in: a gang of misfit thieves & mercenaries (a fantasy version of \\"Ocean's 11\\"!) plot to steal a fortune in precious metals from the dark overlord. Loved the bleak setting for the novel. Perhaps Sanderson was inspired by the Midnight Chronicles Dungeons and Dragons setting, with Izrador = Lord Ruler, legates = obligators, and inquisitors = Night Kings. The inquisitors were chilling and disturbing - easily the best villains I've read in a while, like a fusion of the Cenobites from Hellraiser and the Ringwraiths. I'm attracted to novel ideas & concepts in sci-fi & fantasy fiction, and the original Allomantic and Feruchemical magic systems delivered in this regard. The combat scenes between the allomancers were fantastic - intense and fast-paced & worth rereading. Loved how Sanderson laid out the rules for his magic system, then allowed characters to explore the rules and develop unique tactics, challenging the reader to do the same. Lots of twists and turns in the plot maintained the tension and action in the novel right to the end.<br /><br />That said, there were flaws to this masterpiece. As noted by many other reviewers, the dialogue needed work (what's up with the Tor editors?). Too many stock expressions used over and over, such as characters rolling their eyes or lifting an eyebrow. I cringed when I first read Vin's character using the phrase \\"kind of\\". I'm not saying fantasy characters have to speak a stilted variant of Old English, but overused modern phrases like \\"kind of\\" do not belong in a fantasy novel if the author wants to preserve suspension of disbelief for the reader. Many of the characters were thinly drawn & cliched, but it would have been difficult to explore each and every character and keep the book under 700 pages.<br /><br />One more positive point for the novel: I picked up Mistborn after reading George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones and its sequels, and it was refreshing to be spared the graphic violence, sexually explicit descriptions and constant profanity, which started to wear me down in GoT.
B008OOYALE|3.0|a wonderful game other than one fact ... no goals my sister has it on I phone 4s but for kindle something goes wrong and no goals are made. this makes it hard to get money xp and it just makes the game pointless. please fix as soon as possible

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who has known an Alzheimer's victim.  My mother-in-law lived with our family and Alzheimer's for several years and I saw many of the experiences portrayed in this book.  It was heartbreaking to watch her decline to the point that her memory no longer allowed her to recognize her own children.  Looking through the eyes of Alice actually gave me some comfort about the experience of living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the dignity of life.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book....wow I have no words to describe how terrible this book was. I only picked it up because a friend recommended it to me; god I wish I had not. Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst book I have ever read. Unless you are purely into erotica, then go at it. For those of you looking for a good story: TURN AROUND!<br /><br />The characters in this book is what pissed me off first. Ana, a college student, meets Chrisitian Grey who is the god of all men apparently. He is hot, rich, and has it all. Every girl wants him and Ana is the lucky girl. But Mr. Grey has problems. Big problems.<br /><br />The BDSM was not the issue because I can understand people having an interest in that, but the way it was portrayed here was disgusting and harmful in a way that would leave people scarred for life.<br /><br />Not only that but the WRITING TECHNIQUE!! God, did a fifth grader write this!? This was a mockery for real authors who work hard to write compelling stories for readers to enjoy. I am still wondering how in the world this became a best seller.<br /><br />Ana, the main character, is the most annoying person I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. I mean really? If she doesn't like the sex life that Chrisitian has, then turn around and leave! But no. She stays because of the guilt and the sex and is with a man burried in issues. Issues that have me questioning if he is on the borderline of insanity or needs to go to an asylum.<br /><br />Not only that, but Ana has this way of describing everything with this repetitive tone that I just, literaly, threw the book at the wall and walked away. What I was expecting to live up to the best seller notion did not.<br /><br />This book was beyond an embaressment to read for the lack in grammer, lack in plot and ANY character development, the CONSTANT SEX, and the abusive relationship that is deemed okay. If you like this book, then that is fine. I could see why people would. But I personally, did not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you can get past the crazy sex, you should like this book. Made me want to visit Seattle and Portland.
B0038QGXHW|3.0|These are two of my favorite jazz artists. This is a pleasant effort but there is not much passion. These works don't lend themselves to what Keith excels at. For All We Know has extreme potential, as shown by Brad Mehldau, but Keith just gets through it. Haden's works is suberb. I will play this again, as background dinner music.
030758836X|5.0|Stayed up all night to finish this, then instantly started it again when the kids went to school.  The plot is terrifically entertaining, but read it for the masterful writing--dark, sardonic, and surprisingly funny!  Nick and Amy may not always be nice people, but you have to appreciate their oh-so-snarky, brutally honest insights. I found both characters fascinating and sympathetic (to a point).  Even the minor characters are truly interesting and feel real.  A smart, clever, tricky mindgame of a book.  So much to enjoy here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is exactly what I needed for my Kindle Fire. I use it for anything from bills to homework or when I just can not add up something in my head.
034580404X|5.0|These books were the best I have read in quite awhile.  You could imagine yourself, as someone Christian Grey would be in love with.  I did not care about the sex parts but loved the storyline.  Christian made you feel very protected.  We have passed the books around in our family.  Some people who were faster readers, could not wait until the other people finished the books, so they went and bought their own books.  Truly loved it. Diane

B0079XPUOW|5.0|I just finished the audiobook for this today.  Anyone that loves Star Trek should read this book post-haste.  Or listen to the audiobook like I did, read for you by Wil Wheaton (yes, that Wil Wheaton).<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what the life of those guys that always get blown up in classic Star Trek is like, read the book.  If you're looking to read something fresh and a bit meta, read this book.  If you have any soul at all, read the damned book.<br /><br />The theme song to this book, performed by the great Jonathan Coulton, is also incredible.
B0031P6X2K|5.0|I'm a \\"young\\" fan of Stevie V., and I've had this album on CD for a long time. After many years of use, the CD decided it was ready to take a dirt nap, so away it went.

Then again, sound from vinyls usually sound better lol.<br /><br />Great talent and vinyl come together to form the perfect album: Texas Flood.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this is fun there's more to playing it than a lot of other games and worth checking out. give it a try
B0088X7YU0|3.0|This movie while not all bad has a good story and descent action sequence but thats about it do not expect epic battle sequences or good charator development. the movies of starship toopers had much bigger battle sequence with the bugs then this movie buy it only if you are a hardcore fan of starship troopers.Now only if they would make a halo movie like this but with epic battle sequence.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very addictive game. I can not seem to put it down. the only thing I dislike about this game it the fact that you run out of energy way to fast.

B005LAIHPY|1.0|The movie Battleship was excellant and on par with the Transformer movies. I however cannot watch the Blue Ray as the sound goes blank and the movie freezes. This is not the first Blue Ray movie that i have had problems with so i will no longer be buying blue ray dvd's, as they are a waste of good money.
B0042ETJU2|5.0|I bought this set mainly because i had just purchased the Alien Anthology(import). I had seen Alien Vs Predator also but still did not see the first 2 Predator films. I stumbled across this trilogy and it had a beautiful price so i decided to pick it up. The first movie Predator staring Arnold Schwartzenegger was a pretty fun movie. Arnold leads his team of elite soldiers into a jungle for a rescue mission. needless to say it does not go as planned. The second Film was not nearly as fun in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though there is plenty of shooting and lots of awesome predator kills. however it turns out all the action in this movie didn't make it as desirable as the previous film. The third film is the second best watch although to some it may be the best one. full of great actors. but the story has something to be desired. If you read other reviews you may see that people are having problems with the Digital copies of these movies. This particular feature does not really do anything for me since i never watch movies in my laptop because its a piece of junk, if you are somebody who uses digital copies often when they are provided then you may want to skip this set. If you are someone like me and only watches their movies on a TV then i would highly suggest getting this. Overall the movies score a 4/5 the cover art is very cool and the digital copies don't really carry any weight to make me drop my overall score.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I am a really BIG Bones fan.  I have purchased the first six seasons and watched them over and over.  And I have pre-ordered season seven.  But I join the others who say the price is much too high for 13 episodes.  Love the show, disappointed in the price!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I like it. it is very fun and cool to play. play it now you will like it play it now
B008MBXFEM|1.0|I'm an avid film score nerd, and have been for at least 20 years now. I know a GOOD soundtrack when I hear one. The original \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Tron: Legacy\\", \\"The Black Hole\\", \\"The Chronicles of Narnia (LWW)\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings 3\\", etc. THIS was super-hyped by Zimmer himself to be \\"the best\\", by stating that \\"he was gonna bring it!\\". He didn't bring anything...unless you want to listen to an hour of brooding, low frequency strings humming into your ear, teasing at some sort of acceleration into a climax that never actually happens. There is ONE (count, 1) track here that has a modicum of semblance to an action scene, but even that one is not really that impressive compared to the likes of such music that accompanied epic battle scenes as in the \\"Narnia\\", \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Harry Potter\\" or even \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films. Tracks 1 and 12 shouldn't even be considered tracks! They are soundbytes, and dull, practically inaudible ones at that! For such an accomplished composer, and for such and epic film, I can't wrap my head around what went wrong with this soundtrack. I just wish I could get my $8 back. :(
B00559BT06|5.0|This is great, and is a very good collection for someone who enjoys a lot of Toto's music, but they don't feel that compilation albums have what they want. The only minor problem I have with this is that if you read the description, the CDs are in miniture LP sleeves, and the text naming the songs is very small. But seriously, this is a really good deal, and you will get what you paid for!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I must say that this is the second book that I have read by this author, the first one being Looking For Alaska, and once again  am left utterly speechless. I was pulled in multiple different directions with my emotions, feeling as if I was riding along the shoulders of each character. John Green beautifully illustrates the jourmey that these characters take together on their cancer battles and remissons. After completing this book Im left wanting more, craving relationships like the ones constructed within the book, and left reevaluating my life in the best ways possible. This book has tugged at my heartstrings, leaving me with great expectations for John Greens books to come. I will definitely reread this book time and time again, a great read!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I downloaded this version and there are no ads and it did NOT erase my previous progress as others stated. I love it!
0345803485|4.0|Well I must say I liked it. Way too much hype around this book. The story was good. Lots of redundant lines. Virgin girl falls for scitzo billionaire with abuse issues and they try to meet somewhere in the middle. They are both trying something new and it's like a journey of sorts. Lots of sex. Most of the sex is just intense. A few scenes she's restrained but nothing really weird. If your thinking this particular book is going to have hard bondage your sadly mistaken. If guess if you've never read a book with any sex scenes in them then this might be a shock for you but it's really tame.<br />Ok by the way.... I know he's too old but I can picture Bradley Cooper as Christian and Taylor Swift as Ana......gotta love it!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Great CD! One of my new favorites.  My only wish is that they sold their CDs on the Google Play Store.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This came up on my recommended list and it seemed like such a fun idea, I downloaded it.  From the second chapter onwards, I was hooked.<br /><br />The 80s references and very obscure clues (who else has played Dungeons of Daggorath to the end?) made the book like a delightful puzzle.<br /><br />A few stretches of reality that were inconsistent with the protagonist, but they made not a bit of difference in the context of the story and did not detract from the enjoyment.<br /><br />Some very nice use of language and literary devices brought scenes to life and a few surprises (I won't tell) made the book a page-turner.<br /><br />Well-edited and tightly written, this book has the right tempo to keep you engaged and up a little past your bedtime.  Well done!

0374214913|5.0|\\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" by Robin Sloan truly piqued my interest within the first few pages and firmly held it for well over 100 pages. My interest level did wane eventually, but only slightly in places--never dropping below an 8, but it returned to a 10 again and again as the mysteries deepened and clues continued to lead Clay Jannon into clashes between old knowledge and new technology.<br /><br />The premise is a new clerk, hired at a mysterious bookstore that has even more mysterious customers, starts to realize something funny is going on. And how right he is. Before long, Clay is waist-deep in his attempt to uncover the truth about what the customers are doing with the secretive books they borrow from the not-for-sale section of the store.<br /><br />But there's a clash of cultures, between the old and the new, going on in everthing from record keeping to ideas about immortality. And I think that's where this book really makes its mark. There's a mystery that a secret society has been working to solve for 500 years and Clay and his friends attempt to use all the resources and brightest minds at Google to solve it. Along the way we visit the polar opposites of organizations: from the dim basement lair of a secret society run by a controlling individual averse to change, to the high-tech, cheerful offices of Google that gives everyone the opportunity to become a leader.<br /><br />I read some bizarre stuff, some dark stuff, some downer stuff (maybe too much). \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" was a consistent mainline dose of idealistic positivity, and I was only too happy to go along for the ride. It's sharp, clever, humorous, and it tackles big ideas in an exciting way.<br /><br />How perfect can a book be? I don't know, but this one is pretty close indeed. I very highly recommend this book!<br /><br />I received this book at no cost as a member of the Vine Program.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|This is not the standard Bruce fare. The band is the Irish based Sessions Band, not the E-Street gang. The concert was an outgrowth of the Woody Guthrie tribute that Springsteen recorded around 2005-2006, but all of the selections on this DVD are full of energy, talent and fun. The crowd is really into it and the show is up to it. Very talented musicians and Bruce spotlights them all. His stage presence may be a bit over the top at times but it doesn't matter as the music is so darn good.<br />Video quality is reasonable in blue-ray but the 5.1 sound is excellent. May be a few years old now but the music on this DVD is timeless.

Buy this CD/DVD set if you are a Yanni fan. TERI
B008XBCJ34|2.0|I had not seen this movie until 8-12. I was totally disappointed.  Ignoring the fact that it is obscenely overpackaged, the plot is totally predictable.  In this future why is the \\"corporation\\" totally dependent on the military to defend its mining?  Have humans learned so little about eological balance over the years needed to reach another planet?  Are all sentient beings we encounter in the universe to be exterminated? The characters are stereotypes, and not good ones at that.  The CG action did not look natural (Cameron should take some serious lessons from Peter Jackson).  The \\"bonuses\\" are worthless.  There are some beautiful scenes but I find more beauty in our real world.<br /><br />One viewing is enough for me.  Don'waste your money on this set.  Wait until you can buy the entire movie on one disc in a more traditional plain package.

0345803485|1.0|After all the hoopla I felt compelled to borrow Fifty Shades of Grey from a friend (I would have preferred zero stars, but I do not think you can do that). As a literary publicist I pay attention to literary trends and pop culture shifts so sometimes read books that I normally would not feel compelled to read (i.e., I saw The Secret DVD, yet had not read the book. But did so after hearing so much about it).<br /><br />Grey is remarkably badly written. The verbiage is redundant and immature. 514 pages could easily be distilled into 25. It is not \\"erotica\\" and certainly not \\"romance\\" as the back cover suggests. The characters are not developed and the reader can't possibly feel concern for any of them.  Taylor, the man servant, seems to be the only reasonable person in the lot.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is a literary Pet Rock.  As Ana kept \\"flushing,\\" so too should Fifty Shades of Grey be flushed.

Finally, a female oriented horror/mystery/psychological thriller/creepy/intelligent book. LOVED IT!<br /><br />This book succeeds at what most mysteries fail to do - make it all come together in the end and make sense. There is something wrong with a book that give me suspense and questions and fails to answer them because they can't - this book did it all BRILLIANTLY!

0805095535|3.0|WINTER JOURNAL is only the second book by Paul Auster I have read. I remember greatly enjoying one of his novels a decade or more ago: [[ASIN:0312263996 Timbuktu: A Novel]], with its unusually perceptive canine character, Mister Bones. Auster's memoir, however, was not nearly as enjoyable. With its long detailed lists and descriptions of places he's lived, foods he liked, his life-long love affair with baseball, the many allusions to the breakup of his parents' marriage, as well as the mapping of his own body with its scars both visible and not, the memoir had so much promise. And yet it read almost more like a biography than a memoir. This was due in no large part I think to Auster's unnecessarily artsy and affected use of the second person as his chosen method for telling his story. It felt like he was viewing his own life through the wrong end of a telescope, depersonalizing the naarrative and keeping him at a safe distance from his reader.<br /><br />I was very frustrated and ultimately sad about this narrative device, because many of his experiences, particularly those from his childhood and teenage years, were universal in nature, things I should have been able to identify closely with, but there was that damned second-person \\"you-this\\" and \\"you-that\\" constantly in the way. It's too bad, because Auster's life has been a well-traveled and intensely interesting artist's journey. Unfortunately, he remained largely remote and icily detached. It just didn't work for me.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just like using a regular calculator. The design is simple and intuitive. I like the brushed metal. Truely easy peasy to use.
B008CP93S0|4.0|I totally understand that many people will not get the feel of this movie; like most of David Wain's efforts, it requires a certain attitude to enjoy.  Your average moviegoer will likely not be entertained by the way this movie is structured and delivered, and it's not for no good reason: the movie has serious flaws when compared to well-crafted comedy classics. However, I am confused by the people who liked \\"The State\\" or \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\" but greatly disliked this movie...sure, it strangely danced a line of sincerity and absurdity, something that Wet Hot did not do and it was a greater success for it.  But like Role Models, if you take everything with a grain of salt and simply expect both absurdity and an attempt to honestly connect with the audience, theres a good deal of entertainment to be had here. I read terrible reviews and was disappointed when Wanderlust came out, but after seeing it, I think it's fine.  There is actually one scene that had my girlfriend crying laughing, causing multiple views (of the scene) until our rental timed out.  If you liked \\"The State,\\" I'm not quite sure what your problem with this movie is, unless you expected a full-length sketch movie. Its similar humor but in workable script form, and the actors are doing what they've always done (especially Ken Marino, he's the best jerk ever).  Give it a shot.
B001GGWFFA|5.0|The limited-edition 5-disc set of David Gilmour's \\"Live in Gdansk\\" is an amazing fusion of audio and video. Is it worth the money, though? I suppose that depends on how big a fan you are of the guitarist/vocalist and/or his former band, Pink Floyd. Being a fan of both, I find this set to be very compelling.<br /><br />On the two main CDs, Gilmour offers up 148 minutes of music, nicely balancing work from his 2006 solo album \\"On an Island\\" with older, classic Pink Floyd material. CD 1 features all ten tracks from \\"Island,\\" including the lovely \\"Smile,\\" the harder-rocking \\"Take a Breath\\" and the wistful \\"A Pocketful of Stones.\\" The four Pink Floyd songs are all from \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\": \\"Speak to Me,\\" \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Time\\" and \\"Breathe (Reprise).\\" CD 2 finds Gilmour reaching back into the Floyd canon for some early stuff, including his take on Syd Barrett's \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" plus his own \\"Fat Old Sun\\" from \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" plus some more recognizable stuff such as \\"Echoes,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />The two DVDs offer the following: 1. Video of the Gdansk concert itself, including \\"Castellorizon\\" and all the other \\"On An Island\\" songs plus versions of these Pink Floyd songs: \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"High Hopes,\\" \\"Echoes,\\" \\"A Great Day for Freedom\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" Disc 4 is the other DVD, offering video performances from other stops on the \\"On an Island\\" tour, and some other goodies: For one, it has three \\"barn jams\\" of Gilmour playing with the late Rick Wright and other musicians. For another -- and this is one of the collection's gems -- a DVD-Audio only section with a complete 5.1 mix of \\"On an Island\\"! Altogether, the two DVDs offer 289 minutes of material -- nearly five hours.<br /><br />Disc 5 is a bonus CD of audio tracks from the 2006 tour, and includes \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" \\"Coming Back to Life\\" and \\"On the Turning Away.\\"<br /><br />The lavish packaging also includes some photos and tour memorabilia such as a replica of a backstage pass, but honestly, I hardly glanced at the stuff. The audio and video content here have been my focus, and will continue to be for quite some time. This is a collection to savor, and to return to, again and again.lica of a backstage pass, but honestly, I hardly glanced at the stuff.

0439023513|5.0|I didn't really expect to like the Hunger Games,but I had received a Kindle and wanted to see how I liked it, this series was being talked about on the radio on the way to work,so I thought what the heck. By the time I finished the first book I was not only surprised, but extremely eager to start the next book, then the final in the series, the Mockingjay, it was a fast read, I couldn't put the book down. My only complaint was that the book ended and there was not a sequel. I'm hoping that Suzanne Collins decides to add to this collection, I will be waiting!
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|The movie quality was as if the dvd was restored over and over which the picture was not always clear in many of the seems.  Reminded me of watching a silent movie because sound was also restored.  The adult scenes were not interesting as it was the typical showing of adult nudity.  Would not rent again or reccomend to rent.  It was a very old film production done on a low budget.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Ordered this for my wife who's been wanting this season for months. She called a local video store yesterday to check on the availability and price and they had it for $45.  I told her I bet I could find it cheaper on Amazon but she said she didn't want to wait a couple days or more to get it.  Well, after I looked on Amazon it was only $19.99 and they offered over-night shipping for $3.99.  That's still only around $24 versus $45.  I placed the order with only 50 minutes left until I could get it overnight and to be quite honest I didn't believe it possible it would arrive that fast.  Well, in less than 24 hours after I ordered the DVD it came by UPS, (My personal favorite for delivery), right on time and in perfect condition! My wife is very happy and is currently watching the DVD with my daughter.  Saved me over $20 and not to mention gasoline money!  LOL... Thanks Amazon only now my wife will be wanting more items and probably will be checking out Amazon more than she has been.  OH NO!!!...  Not two Amazon addicts under the same roof!
0345803485|1.0|For Ted Bundy, the intersection of graphic sex and violence resulted in rape and serial killing. And here we have the intersection of graphic sex and violence.<br />How stupid is this? While not everyone-obviously-will become a mass murderer-what is this book promoting? Why would women themselves promote an association between violence and sex? Why would we want to encourage men, many of whom are already addicted to violent video games, to partner violence with sex? Is our gender really this dim witted?<br />Hello?<br />And you don't have to read more than a few pages to see why the writing sells-it appeals to those with \\"bottom fish\\"  literary taste-those whose other books might include comic books and the TV guide. And Costco has the nerve to sell this garbage? I'm pretty sure if James Sinegal was still running the company, this would Never fly. I am sorry to be harsh-but really, aren't people more people better than this?

B004AXNOS8|5.0|I ve seen the movie before on dvd quality and as it was the first time i watched Kill Bill i thought it was the best it could get. Tarantino has put all his the cult he could get into that film.<br />So about the blu-ray. Picture and audio quality are top notch. Its like watching the movie from scratch. Like you haven't seen it before. You notice those details in the image and thats the magic of blu-ray. Combined with a great tv set this is 5 stars.

B004SBQGHS|2.0|Was great until latest update ; Now causing all kinds of GRAPHICS PROBLEMS including Slowing action, Floating Debris all over screen, Freeze-ups, etc.  I played the FREE version before downloading this one and IT WORKED FINE on my XOOM TABLET.  I decided to download it to remove the ANNOYING ADS.  Well the ads are gone but now I can't play game without serious issues.  ROVIO is changing something that is creating these problems in all of the Angry Bird apps lately.  They are well aware of this problem sine I (and others) have reported it to them.  They are supposedly looking into it but mostly tell us to reboot.  That does not help at all.  I know Xoom Tablets in particular experience this.  Please report to Rovio if you have same issues.  This will help by letting them know that it is not just a few devices having trouble.  Hopefully they will fix some day.  Terrible for now!  Thanks.

B008966SLM|5.0|Robert Cray has never released a bad album. Some are augmented by horn sections or a second guitarist, and some stand apart because of exceptional songs (\\"Strong Persuader\\", \\"Take Your Shoes Off\\"). But bad, as in boring or tasteless? I don't believe so.<br /><br />Always consistent, Cray has broken new ground with \\"Nothin' But Love\\". 2009's \\"This Time\\" brought us a revitalized band- the return of bassist Richard Cousins and the addition of drummer Tony Braunagel gave Cray needed spark, captured brilliantly on 2010's live \\"Cookin' In Mobile\\". On this latest offering, strong songwriting and a great producer make it work. Kevin Shirley has a well deserved reputation with bands like Iron Maiden and Rush, but he actually started producing South African musicians in his native Johannesburg. He earned respect in the blues rock world with Joe Bonamassa's many successes, including \\"Dust Bowl\\" and \\"Live From The Royal Albert Hall\\". Shirley recorded the band straight from a short tour into a week's worth of rehearsals. His timing, as well as his youthful and eclectic input culminated in one of Cray's most energetic offerings.<br /><br />\\"Nothin' But Love\\" contains some of the strongest songwriting in Robert Cray's canon. Bassist Cousins, along with writing partner Hendrix Ackle wrote the opening track \\"Won't Be Coming Home\\". Great jazz inspired guitar on this minor key Blues, which Cray is a master of. Keyboardist Jim Pugh and drummer Braunagel offer \\"Worry\\", which is a heartfelt song about a man watching his daughter grow up, and the worry that comes to every man in his position. Pugh also wrote \\"I'll Always Remember You\\", and Cray plays well against the horn arrangement.<br /><br />Cray is as mighty with the pen as he is with the guitar on this disc. \\"Side Dish\\" is an uptempo fun R&B number that will guarantee to get you moving. His many shout-out food references are in the best Blues tradition (think \\"Chicken In The Kitchen\\" from \\"This Time\\"). \\"I'm Done Cryin' deals with the losses so many have endured in these tough economic times, but the man telling the story will retain his dignity. \\"Sadder Days\\"has a beautiful melody, and the lyrics are a clever play on words. The man doesn't want his woman to leave, but leave she does- on a Saturday. When that day of the week comes around, it's a \\"sadder day\\".<br /><br />\\"Blues Get Off My Shoulder\\" is a Bobby Parker song first recorded in 1958 with saxophonist Paul Williams.It was Shirley's idea to cover the track, and Cray does justice to the song without copying Parker's licks. The live bonus track, \\"You Belong To Me\\" is a great way to end this fine album; both Pugh and Cray get to stretch out on this one. Magic Sam would be proud.<br /><br />This may be the most diverse collection of songs in Robert Cray's career, at least equal to \\"Take Your Shoes Off\\". There are political statements and mature observations, along with some new love-gone-wrong numbers. Cray should be applauded for not falling into the \\"rock crossover\\" trap. He has maintained his integrity throughout his career by playing sweet soul blues, and his style owes more to Albert King and Cornell Dupree than Hendrix or SRV. The disc also comes with a booklet describing the making of the music by Henry Yates, with personal quotes from Cray himself. \\"Nothin' But Love\\" is nothing but great.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|The original is always fun to go back and play. Lot of fun, nice to have it ad free. Those complaining about ads are talking about Rovio's own ads for other Angry Bird version and Rovio games which they all have and dosnt take away from the game at all.<br />An add free version of a top rated android classic is a better &quot;Free app of the day&quot; than alot of the junk apps we get. Thanks Amazon and Rovio! I bought Rio and Space, now I have the original in ad free.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I pre-ordered my season 2 special edition Walking Dead like any good fan would, it came 1 day after it was released. Packaged in 3 boxes and bubble wrap, it took a good long time to get into it, but once I did, I realized it was worth EVERY penny! The detail on the face, the paint, the gore! I was in zombie paradise! The screwdriver is removable and the blu-rays have their own case. It scared the crap out of my kids the second they saw it. That should keep them out of the blu-rays for a few years! The disks are riddled with a few easter eggs and a few great \\"documentary\\" shorts. Also commentary is available on a few episodes. Worth listening to if you are a big fan! Now I just have to wait til october for my Compendium 2, and season 3 to start!
B00881VLCE|3.0|really great app lots of options and they say they update with more often but haven't played long enough to know yet. only downside is I wish there was an option to save a puzzle your working on I don't always have the time to finish them and its to easy to do a small puzzle for a puzzler like me. but otherwise if u like puzzles this is the app for u
B000VOC90Y|5.0|The only backpack that I've owned that has not been complete junk was a High Sierra backpack. This lasted for me 6 years before the shoulder strap broke. This time around, I was interested in a backpack that would last me for even longer and hopefully would contain better quality materials than the High Sierra; let's just say the High Sierra one was nothing special. So I did a bit of research online. Here is what I was looking for:<br /><br />1. I wanted the backpack to able to hold a lot of stuff, for school, and for general use. In addition, I didn't want the backpack to be huge and bulky.<br /><br />2. I wanted the backpack to be strong and sturdy, with components that wouldn't tear under stress. A large aspect that I was very picky about was the materials and overall composition of the backpack. I did not want cheap materials that would give away at the slightest sign of pressure. I wanted a backpack that would last.<br /><br />3. I was looking for shoulder straps that were wide and thick, to provide a strong and reliable carrying ability, as well as to make the backpack comfortable to wear. Wide and padded shoulder straps are essential for making the backpack comfortable to wear, as these features keep the straps from digging into your shoulders. And with a lot of weight, this can be very uncomfortable and even painful.<br /><br />4. In addition to the shoulder straps, I wanted the backpack to be padded, inside, for the safety of my possessions, and outside, for comfortableness.<br /><br />5. One of the main causes for backpacks to become useless are the zippers. Thus I was careful to find a backpack that did not have cheap zippers.<br /><br />6. Lastly, I wanted the backpack to be at a reasonable price, as some sellers will completely rip you off (like Staples, for example, would sell this exact backpack for $120).<br /><br />After quite a bit of looking around (in stores as well as online), I narrowed my choices down to one: The SwissGear Ibex Backpack for 17\\" Laptops. This backpack not only fulfilled my expectations, but exceeded them as well.<br /><br />1. Room-wise:<br />This backpack can fit an awful lot of stuff. It was able hold two of my (fully filled) 2\\" binders, my 15.6\\" laptop (with a thick sleeve), about 10 folders, a notebook, my Audio-Technica headphones (which have a very large case), my computer charger, two computer mouses, a mouse-pad, my iPod Classic, a kindle, some cords, and lots of pens. Obviously, it can hold quite a bit. (*note: My 15.6 inch laptop fits with its sleeve but very snugly. The backpack can't hold a much larger sized laptop, so 16 or 16.5 inches I would recommend as the limit. If you own a larger laptop, look into the [[ASIN:B0001EMM10 Targus XL Backpack Designed for 17 Inch Notebooks TXL617 (Black with Blue Accents)]] , although the Targus XL is HUGE, or the [[ASIN:B00507NAYQ Targus Drifter II Backpack Designed for 17-Inch Laptop TSB239US (Black/Gray)]] , which is also slightly larger in height according to the product dimensions on Amazon.) (*another note: the backpack won't hold much more than written above.)<br /><br />2. Strength:<br />The Ibex is definitely not made of junk. The materials are strong and reliable as well as high quality and the backpack should be able to deal with a good amount of weight and pressure. There are little or no cheap materials in this backpack.<br /><br />3. Shoulder-Straps:<br />The shoulder-straps on the Ibex blew me away. They were thick, padded, wide, and were sown onto the backpack securely with multiple layers of stitching. This caused the backpack to be very comfortable when worn and not a pain to the shoulders. Another neat feature was that the shoulder-straps included a shock absorbing elastic material that would not only balance the weight and absorb shock, but even cause the backpack to feel lighter and less of a burden.<br /><br />4. Padding:<br />One feature that I see missing in many backpacks is padding. Either the inside is padded andthe outside is not or vice versa. The Ibex has padding on the inside (especially for the laptop compartment), as well as padding on the shoulder-straps and back for maximum comfortableness.<br /><br />5. The Zippers:<br />As I have seen in many backpacks, zippers easily get broken or detached. If you don't to want to replace you're backpack every few months, you must find one that has sturdy zippers. The Ibex has strong and reliable zippers, I have seen better, but these are very satisfactory. (*note: the zippers on the Ibex are made of pure metal, so the handles won't tear and make the backpack a pain to open and close.)<br /><br />6. Pricing:<br />This backpack (specifically on Amazon) is at a great price. When you read this review, know that I bought it for $63 (plus tax). But also know that you should never have to pay more than 100 or even 90 dollars for a backpack if you are using it for similar purposes. This backpack is a great, high quality product that is available at a decent and reasonable price.<br /><br />Specs:<br />If you want to see the backpack's features in detail, I suggest looking up a review video on YouTube. But I will describe it as best as I could here in this review.<br /><br />Pockets:<br />This backpack has 5 surface pockets and 4 side pockets, each of them (except the easy access pocket and the side pockets) contains one or more extra compartments within them.<br /><br />1. The main pocket holds the laptop compartment and is located at the topmost area of the bag (nearest to the back). The laptop compartment inside the main pocket is padded and has an elastic Velcro strap for use of holding a laptop in nice and snug. The main pocket also holds a folder-like compartment that stands opposite to the laptop compartment (nearest to the back of the backpack). At the top of the main pocket is a mesh and zippered compartment that is relatively small. NOTE: The main pocket is tall, but not very thick. It may not be able to hold more than your laptop and a few papers and folders. So don't count on being able to fit much more.<br /><br />2. The next pocket down is a smaller, \\"easy access\\" pocket. This pocket is very shallow and is meant for small items that you might need to retrieve during the day, such as keys, MP3s, cellphones, earphones, and other small gadgets. From this compartment there is a connecting hole to the next pocket which leads to a small opening at the surface of the backpack. This is meant for earphones, headphones and such that you might use when listening to devices such as your phone, mp3, or iPod.<br /><br />3. The next pocket is the pocket meant for the majority of your stuff (in my case, the two binders). It is very wide, so it can hold a lot of thicker objects such as textbooks, notebooks, and binders, shoes, clothing, etc. It consists of another, folder like compartment. The pocket also includes a flap, that when pushed down, gives a sturdy bottom to the backpack so it can stand upright. However, this compartment is not as tall as the laptop compartment so it will fit thicker but not taller objects.<br /><br />4. The next pocket is a similar, smaller version of the previous pocket. It is a relatively simple one as it holds just one attached mesh zippered compartment. I use it for storing electronics such as my headphones, my computer mouses, my cords, and my mousepad.<br /><br />5. The fifth and last surface pocket is the one meant for smaller accessories (for me school supplies). It holds smaller pockets for pens and pencils, a neat little pocket for a pocket knife (specifically a Swiss Army knife), a mesh pocket, and a larger zippered pocket.<br /><br />6. Each side of the backpack has one mesh (un-zippered) pocket and one zippered pocket, used for water bottles and such.<br /><br />There is a smaller pocket on the front of the left shoulder strap that is made for a cell phone or mp3. However, note that it is too small for most cellphones nowadays and is also two small for many mp3s and iPods.<br /><br />Handles:<br />The Ibex backpack has two handles. The primary one, which is made of steel wire and is coated in plastic, is located between the easy access pocket and the third surface pocket. There is another handle at the very back of the backpack which is meant for hanging the backpack on a hook. But I do not recommend using it if the backpack is fully loaded and heavy.<br /><br />Padding:<br />The Ibex backpack consists of inner and outer padding. The inner padding is found mainly by the computer and easy access compartments. The shoulders are well padded and the back of the backpack has a top padding, two paddings on the sides, and a back-bottom padding.<br /><br />Water Resistant?<br />The Ibex backpack is made of a relatively tight-woven fabric and has multiple layers, so it should keep most water out. However it is only water resistant, not water proof, so if exposed to a large amount of water and/or is exposed to water for a large amount of time, or if it is dropped in a pool, the contents will get wet! But the backpack can definitely manage a bit of rain. Note that the bottom of the backpack is made of a plastic/rubber material that is water proof; so don't worry about putting it on wet floors and such.<br /><br />After researching these features, I bought the Ibex and I now own it. I am completely satisfied with the results of this product and I would definitely recommend it. It is made of high quality materials, is sold a reasonable price, and should last for a long time. The Ibex is well made and properly designed and is a good backpack for whatever use you may need it for. Buy it!top and a few papers and folders. So don't count on being able to fit much more.<br /><br />2. The next pocket down is a smaller, \\"easy access\\" pocket.

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This movie is a stroke of genius in that it unites six comic book heroes whom are well loved by their fans. On their own these guys automatically generate a large box office. But together you make SIX times the profit! Why not get twelve in the next one!? But hey, maybe it isn't so bad. Now I will try to do this fairly. Here are the reasons why I think The Avengers is a new low for movies.<br /><br />Story: Talk about the most rehashed plot ever. Has Hollywood lost all imagination? There are so many interesting tales to tell that I'm saddened by such an excuseless lack of creativity. The story should always come first; not 20 minute long pointless action scenes. I emphasize the word pointless, meaning that action scenes don't have to be that way, as long as you use them as a way of developing the characters as they're unfolding. This leads me to my next point.<br /><br />Characters: These are just cardboard cutout stereotypes that happen to have powers. Ironman is arrogant and knows it. Thor has godlike strength yet  is a big dummy. Hawkeye is a blank paper that someone forgot to write even a sentence on. Black Widow is just there for looks. And Hulk...need I say more? Gone are the personal hero stories where we get to see the inner struggles of being a hero, such as in the Spiderman and Batman trilogies. Now we get less true conflict and more beat each other up 'conflict'. Written badly. Acted poorly.<br /><br />Artificially forcing heroes together (for profit): This is the foundation for the entire movie. These protagonists obviously do not belong together. And when you're trying to tell six different stories inbetween dull action sequences, you can't tell much. There are times where even the movie itself realizes the ridiculousness of putting them together. An example of this is in the aggrevatingly long final battle scene where the Hulk and Thor have just fought side by side. The Hulk, realizing that he has done most of the work, punches Thor offscreen.<br /><br/>This movie has no artistic value, and is merely a cash cow. The idea was a genius, but unethical way to make money. And inevitably, it was hugely popular.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|I don't usually read fantasy preferring biography, non fiction and more literary fiction. But I am quite intrigued now by this well written tale that transports one to a time like the middle ages with all shades of darkness and light in the portrayed characters and events naturalistically described. The story is gripping. Our senses become engaged with rich descriptions of varied rugged landscapes and castles, clothing colours and textures, sumptuous foods and delightful details, often raw... of human engagement with the loving qualities of the animal kingdom and human interaction sometimes tender more often brutal.It did not matter one bit that I lost track of who all the knights were with their differing allegiances. The main characters remained as large as life.Travelling Europe as I am now, my eyes are honing in on all that is medieval... I'm now bereft though without my read so must purchase book 3 tomorrow.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|In 1997 when the Swans originally broke up, I thought they finished at a peak with powerful Soundtracks for the Blind and live album The Swans are Dead (two of my all time favorite Swans albums).  In the years since then I've occasionally listened to Gira's new project Angels of Light, and while I liked it, it never matched the magnificence of the Swans album.  So in 2010 when I learned that Gira was making music under his Swans band name again, I was excited but also worried, so many reunion albums are disappointing.  My Father was an okay album, but it also felt much like a hybrid Angels of Light / Swans album, which was okay but it was too short and didn't match up to the better Swans albums.<br /><br />With the Seer everything has changed.  This one seems to be a move forward to something new yet reminiscent of the beautiful Soundtracks.  There is no concern with this album being commercial (not that any Swans album was), but instead it has long sections of dronish buildup and long intros before something happens.  Its challenging yet amazing, if one loves the Soundtracks for the Blind era this album is a must buy (its also more cohesive than Soundtracks).  In my opinion this is the movement forward that I was hoping for when I saw the Swans were being reformed, a beautiful work.

1932735410|4.0|Overall it's a great study guide, with lots of examples, thorough explanations and many sample questions. The drawback, is that there is not pdf version offered (as with most other books), so I cannot always carry on the book or read at night. I  understand that this is to protect the company sales by only offering a hardcopy. Also, the demo cd (available from website also) offered with 24 questions is another marketing trick, to make you buy the expensive full version, which is just an XML file download update with all of the questions, when unlocking the software.
1476712042|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I was pulled in from the 1st page and I could not put it down. I read this book within 24hrs. I DEVOURED it!! Abby's and Travis' relationship was a little dysfunctional however, no one's relationship is perfect. He was a complete \\"Bad Boy\\" and bad boys need love to. It just takes them finding the right person to soften their image. I didnt see Travis as being a bully. He just didnt take any crap off of anyone nor did he allow/liked his friends to be disrespected or talked about. He took up for Abby when she was being assaulted and trashed by the football team. I loved that about him. Even though he had that bad boy image he was intelligent and had a heart. To be honest, I like Travis more than I liked Abby.  She got on my nerves with all the back and forth between him and Parker, and whether or not she should be with him. A lot of the her heartache was caused on herself. If she would have vocalized her feelings to Travis about her past and Vegas, some of their agruments/breakups could have been avoided. Travis was more honest than Abby. Abby lied about being from KS, and the issue with Vegas could have been avoided if she just told him about it.  I am a firm believer of the saying \\"closed mouths don't get fed\\". I am tempted to reread this book again because I loved it that much. I can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out in April 2013. I would love to see what Travis was thinking when he first laid eyes on Abby and what he actually felt for the \\"one night standers\\"
B00479SVBU|5.0|I purchased this unit to use on my boat and I'm 100% pleased with the results.<br /><br />The unit worked perfectly as soon as I plugged it in.  Within moments, literally, I was able to enjoy music from the same mp3 source at every station in my boat equipped with an FM receiver.  No wires to run, no DC cables to connect, no speakers to hide = no aggravation.<br /><br />A few days later I showed the unit to a friend whose SUV lacks a CD changer.

He was a little overprotective, jealous and crazy hince 50 shades of f'd up but I still fell for him. In the first book, I wasn't so sure about him, but by book 2, I was in love with him. In book 2 you it dived more into his passed and why he is Fifty. I loved how vulnerable he became and dropped to his knees like a submissive to keep Ana from leaving him. Now book 3 got on my LAST nerves. It started to be a little redundant and the I found myself skipping over the sex scenes. I dont know any couple that does \\"it\\" 3 and 4 times a day everyday. The ending was horrible!!!!!!!!!! Who ends a book saying that is all for now?? Really?? If it is true that she will write 3 more books from Christian's POV, I would love to read it and I hope she changes up the sex scenes and add more dialogue.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|This movie was well directed and acted. It gave me a view of the artist that I was not aware of. I recommend it.
B004EQAVFU|5.0|Have to say I am surprise to see negative reviews for \\"Never let me go\\", though I do understand each one of us do have different interpretation of things, I could hardly believe anyone would rate this movie as a piece of junk, this would be a unfair injustice to the quality of the interpretation and the depth & dense script that does the job to tell the history of this impacting book.<br />So...finally I do recommend this movie for people that enjoy dense and well written scripts, do recommend for people that like to see great acting, do recommend for people with open mind (as the book's writer) to tell a history from a different angle where the what is on the stake is not the simple Cartesian \\"I am in favor or against organs donation or cloning\\". This is a piece of art and surely it deserves the kudos for a well job done.

B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My son will soon be 7 and loves angry birds. wE RECEIVED THIS AROUND aUGUST 6th. He loves playing with this game.  I like it because it requires dexterity and mental thought.  It gets him away from the electronics and makes him think while he is having fun.  I usually do not like games with lots of pieces but these are a good size and we haven't lost any yet.  I keep it in the plastic form that came in the box.  My dog ate the box - really - so I just slide it in a 2 gallon sized zipper bag - works great!
0553293397|5.0|There will always be a soft spot in my heart for Asimov's I ROBOT short story collection and his THE REST OF THE ROBOTS short story collection.  But this is my favorite Asimov novel; it is also one of my all-time favorite detective novels, SF or non-SF.  It is sort of a sequel to an earlier novel of his: The Caves of Steel.  But I like this one a lot better.  You don't need to read them both, or read them in order; but it is true that the two novels enrich each other in defining a future allegorical world view, and in highlighting the relationship between the two detectives.<br /><br />If you are one of those people who absolutely must read things in order, I would start with the Positronic Robot short story collections, then take on the novels in order, finishing with the final short story: I ROBOT; THE REST OF THE ROBOTS; THE CAVES OF STEEL; THE NAKED SUN; THE ROBOTS OF DAWN; MIRROR IMAGE.  I have not read Mirror Image.  I consider The Robots of Dawn the weakest novel in the series.  I think Asimov got bored with the series toward the end (while writing Robots of Dawn?) and went on to other projects.  When fans wanted more, all he could deliver was a final short story.<br /><br />A human detective: Elijah.  His partner Daneel is a robot so perfectly humanoid that other humans, and other robots, think it is human.<br /><br />What keeps me coming back to re-read The Naked Sun is the strongly allegorical presentation, the \\"male bonding\\" between the human detective and the robot detective, the robots (yes, I'm a robot freak), and the awesome detective \\"who-done-it\\" at the center of it all.  The detective aspects are not as lyrical as Raymond Chandler nor as breezy as Robert B. Parker, but they are vintage Asimov at the absolute top of his game.<br /><br />In this series Asimov takes neurotic mental quirks, pushes them to their logical extremes, and elegantly builds a future out of them.  Elijah has lived his entire life enclosed in tiny habitation boxes of overcrowded Earth; a mob of people pressing in upon him is comforting, while a free open space cripples him with terror.  On Solaria, where the detectives go to solve a murder, humans rarely come into actual physical contact; almost all human intercourse is done by \\"viewing\\" which is so \\"lifelike\\" that Elijah at first mistakes it for actually being with another person.  On Solaria, with each human residing on a separate estate cared for by an army of robots, the idea of actually being in physical proximity with another person is disgusting.<br /><br />The copyright on this puppy is 1956.  Nature versus Nurture.  In this future Asimov pushes the limits of Nurture: the people in these novels are the product of their environment.  Powerful Spacers versus powerless Earthers.  This was state-of-the-art Science Fiction in the Fifties, and it still kicks ass and takes names in 2012.  I almost wish another writer would take on this future with a few more \\"authorized\\" sequels.  If someone paid me to write one, the moment I came up with a default-plot I would jump in, full-tilt boogie!  @hg47<br /><br />Oops!<br />P.S. - that would be Postscript.<br />P.R. - that would be Post Review.<br /><br />On GoodReads I just learned about a 4th novel in this series I was not aware of: Robots and Empire.  Asimov's fans demanded, and the dude did deliver.  My mistake.  @hg47Earth; a mob of people pressing in upon him is comforting, while a free open space cripples him with terror.

B0006AAS5G|1.0|I bought this watch in 2011 but it did not even last a year. Although the watch looked stunning, the internal mechanism was sketchy. The spindle to adjust the dials must have 3 positions as per the manual but it only moves 2 notches. The chrono function is triggered by the first button on top while it is reset by the last button. When you reset the chrono the second hand spins counter clockwise to come back to the home position.<br /><br />Now, if u move frequently between time zones line I do, you have to constantly keep adjusting the times. Here is where all the problems started. When you pull the spindle to set the time the spindle does not latch on to the right postion to set the time. Within 6 months I had the spindle completely disengage from the watch.<br /><br />As for the service, invicta provided an extended 5 year warranty on the watch however, you have to jump a few hoops before you can send the watch in for service. First you need to create a service ticket online on their website. Then you have to mail the watch to them along with a $30 handling and return shipping fee. If you have to spend $30 on a watch that costed $90 within a year, then that does not sound like good deal to begin with. Then they say that you have to wait for a while (i think like 5 or 6 weeks) to get back your watch. Even then if they find that some parts are damaged. you will have to pay for those parts. only service would be free.<br /><br />All in all a bad investment. You will be better off with a fossil.

B00884GR0W|4.0|I believe this game is pretty cool. It doesn't copy Minecraft so that's pretty cool.I like the quests and being able to fly and also the fact that you can level up. The reason I gave this a 4 is because of a few reasons. 1.)Some things are misspelled and uncorrectly written sentences are irritating.<br />2.)The tools are annoying because stone and iron pickaxes wear out at the same rate and iron is much harder to get. The same with all the weapons. They are often hard to make but wear out way too fast like the tools.<br />3.)Buckets can only be used once so if you want to do something you have to make a lot.<br />Suggestions: I think more things should be added to the craft table and maybe a second more advanced craft table be added. Also it would be nice to have some doors for houses. And if its possible can you add animals that you can buy from Shadow Hunter the Merchant?<br />If you are a developer of Block Story can you please think about these? That would be great.
0802473156|5.0|My wife and I use this material for a marriage class at our church. It is such a simple concept that can make a huge difference in understanding other people and why they react like they do. And also why you do what you do and feel so let down sometimes when your spouse has done something nice but you don't receive it as love. A must for every couple, no matter the length of marriage!
B003Y5H54W|2.0|There were a lot of reasons I should have loved this movie. I like nontraditional takes on classic fairy tales, like Once Upon a Time and the 10th Kingdom, but I really didn't care for this movie at all. I also usually the love the cast, but they were horrible in this movie. It was almost painful to watch. The only reason it got two stars instead of one is because despite it's flaws, there was something about it that had me watch the entire thing.
0385040253|5.0|This book has just about every knot known to man, from sailing knots and macrame' knots to hangmans knots and the monkey's fist knot... if you're looking for a special kind of knot for ANY kind of project, you just can't go wrong with this book. \\"Ashley's Knots\\" shows how to splice one rope to another and demonstrates so many things to do with a rope or cord that if I was ever on a desert island (or similar circumstances), I would hope I'd brought this book or had memorized most of its contents. Truly incredible.<br /><br />I was expecting \\"Ashley's Knots\\" to be about the dimensions of a text book, but it's much larger at 11\\" x 8.75\\" x 1.75\\" and is quite hefty at just under 4 pounds. I guess for all those illustrations and in-depth discussions, they needed as much room as they could get. Would be a nice addition for any sailor's library or a nice coffee table book for similar tradesman or hobbyist.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, it is not often that I find a book that is on the cusp of popularity and greatness, but I truly think that once the buzz begins, this will be blockbuster.  I stumbled upon this title after reading the \\"50 Shades Trilogy\\".  I will often put books on my Kindle wish list, but this one I purchased immediately and began reading (ironically on July 5, 2012).  I could not put it down and fell asleep several nights with it in my hands on the pillow.  The characters were maxi-multi-dimensional and the plot thickened with every page.  I fear to say more, revealing too much for those who want to read it (but it was my favorite summer read this year!)
014305841X|3.0|It's a well researched book, but my God, this does drone on...and on...and on.... sixteen hours of obsession by this oh-so-superior author. The author has many interesting facts and insights about all that is wrong with the farm factory and big business of food today.  I am pretty sure he could have conveyed all that in a more animated manner and in about half the number of pages.  The author has a remarkable lack of ability to edit himself and he has no common sense. For example, when he decides to gather weird colored \\"salt\\" from a polluted, trash-riden, probably mercury-laden salt pond, does he really need to taste it (duh - it tastes metallic) to decide against serving it to his friends?  Personally, I'm willing to bet that a year's worth of unhealthy GMO corn couldn't possibly be more harmful than that one taste! And when he describes his decision to take cherries from a neighbor's tree because the branch hangs over the fence into a friend's yard, does he really need to tell me all the historical, legal and sociological reasons why that is permissable? The author has a point of view. It's just a point of view that only looks at one side of the equation.  If you are looking to learn more about what is wrong with food production today, this book has it all.  But if you are looking for a quick, entertaining read or a balanced viewpoint, you won't find it here.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app! I love that you can use it offline,  that you can access various languages and versions of the Bible,  and that this app gives you access to numerous reading plans. I love the way you can easily move around the Bible via the headers. Our church links their sermon notes (and you can type your own it) to YouVersion. It saves a ton of trees. Really,  the only thing I wished the app had was a topical index,  where you could find verses related to keywords (such as parenting, love, marriage, strength). The app is do great I have it on my Kindle and iphone. I showed it to my 60 year old mom and she thought it was so cool that she downloaded it too. I had to give her a short tutorial on how to use it, but she finds it easy to use.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The naieveté of the narrator - Enzo the dog- made him the ideal witness to his owner's life.  He was able to make observations that were deeper than a human character could by virtue of his meta-perspective on the human condition, all the while yearning to be as flawed as the train wreck of disasters that befall humans in their ordinary course of life.  The brevity of a dog's life created a natural beginning and end to the events, yet the reader understands that there is no beginning, no end.

0307455874|5.0|As our President's first term nears its close, we must wonder, not only how he sustained himself in a country filled with hatred and racist attitudes, but when his attitude of compromise was met with a vow to never allow him a 'win', never give him an inch, regardless of the destruction that caused our country. Again and again he maintained an attitude of humility filled with hope that the people in Congress could and would change, if only for the good of the country and their own constituents. It was never to be and he took the blame like the man of strength that he is. Even his own party pundits showed their true colors, colors that were decidedly white. I remember wondering in his first couple of years if they would ever be satisfied, and where was the intelligence these people have when dealing with a white President? How could they expect that he could do it all, fix it all, heal everyone that has been trampled nearly to death in the past decade or more? And do it without help, even from his own party. To a chorus of me firsts, me firsts, he made his attempts at compromise and kept hopeful thereby making many of us who understood, who could read between the lines, also hopeful.<br /><br />And then one day he did what they'd been wailing for. He stood up and talked back and fought. What did that get him? Did they support him then? Did he get credit for his courage? Oh, not so much, not so much.<br /><br />And thus we are brought to the place the people who participated in this on both sides of the aisle, allowed to happen, and if he wins this next term it will be because of his AUDACITY of HOPE, his fight for survival, not for himself but for his people. And who are his people? US. The poor and middle class who need him with such desperation. We are white, black, red, brown, yellow, whatever the color, most of us struggle, none know hatred and because of our leader, our Leader of the FREE WORLD, President Barack Obama, we have the audacity to hope. Thank you dear President. You are THE leader of all time and we cannot thank you enough.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read by every American who wants to understand how we got to where we are and why there is so much hatred in a country that has so much to offer, so much love, so much pain and dismay. Read and understand. Read and you 'will' understand! Then pass this wonderful book on to others right away!<br /><br />In Hope<br />babs lakey

B00846REIS|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this after all the great reviews it received. But, I feel let down. With all the \\"if you like FSOG you'll love this one\\", I was pumped for a great read. You would think I would love it, since it is basically FSOG, but not as good. There are so many similarities it's laughable. Right down to that damn silver tie. Can you guess what Gideon was wearing the second time Eva met him? And she met him by falling in his office building by the way. Unfortunately, this book was just sex with no story for me. I did find myself smiling a few times but I cringed more. The sex scenes were all basically the same. Gideon used the \\"C\\" word (referring to female anatomy) more than I use the word \\"the\\". That was turn off number one. And some of things he would say during sex, were not sexy AT ALL. Turn off number two, their way of dealing with conflict was to have sex. They never worked anything out, just had more sex. I could go on, but I don't want it to seem that I am bashing this author. I am giving this book 2 stars because in spite of all it lacked, it wasn't horrible.<br /><br />I received this book from NetGalley for review.

I had hoped that she would've revealed an epiphany of some sort, but I didn't see it.<br /><br />It made me interested in the Pacific Crest Trail, enough so that I sought pics of it in the internet.<br /><br />I was a little confused why Oprah promoted this book as she did. It was well written, but there were no great insights of wisdom or spirituality.<br /><br />Also, I think Cheryl Strayed revealed a little too much information about her sexual adventures and personal hygiene than I cared to know about.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must admit I read the novel because of all of the \\"anti-hype\\" surrounding it.  Yes, the poor reviews themselves were entertaining enough to lure me in.  I gave in and read the story simply for entertainment purposes; I wanted to laugh at how horribly written it was, how awful the sex scenes were and how juvenile her writing style was... BUT I DIDN'T!<br /><br />Okay, so if I finish a story, then it usually gets three stars or better.  Why?  Because the author kept me interested enough to read until the end, therefore there's no way I could morally deem it \\"awful\\".  I finished 50 Shades and was pleasantly surprised.  There were moments where I thought the main character was an imbecile (cough...Ana), but an idiotic character doesn't necessarily mean the author is stupid.  There was repetition, yes, but now I'm starting to wonder whether I noticed it because it occurred so often, or if I only picked up on it because everyone pointed it out.<br /><br />I am going to give E.L. James the benefit of the doubt because, honestly, I couldn't put the book down (this was a one-day endeavor for me), and although the ending was absurd (Ana, you set yourself up for that sh!t) and anticlimactic (har har), maybe the second one will turn things around.<br /><br />Finally, the story line was different.  This tale was not all sex as some reviews would lead you to believe; there were moments of psychological depth that literally had me intrigued.<br /><br />A new perspective... a new lifestyle... sprinklings of kinky sex.... I mean, that's pretty damn interesting.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about these books from a friend, so I decided to check it out. When I began to read the reviews here on Amazon I was convinced that it was going to be a horrible buy so I decided then to not bother with it. About a month later I talked to my mom who mentions she has read all three books and even though some of it was a bit much for her, she really loved the storyline. That made me curious so I got the first book and was completely caught up in the story and finished it in two days and I'm now on the second one. I think it is well worth the time to check it out. Don't let so many negative reviews put you off like they did to me at first. I almost missed out on some really great books. Honestly the negative reviews seem so petty and childish and if you truly didn't like the book, why waste so much time writing about it, lol?

I expected a more controversial book and definitely thought it would be steamier!<br />I did enjoy the character development and the story most of the time. About half way through I started getting a little bored and found the whole Abby and Travis together and apart and together and apart thing a little ridiculous by the end!<br />But it was entertaining and often fun.<br />It could have been much better though. The editor missed out on some big flaws, an example being that you would be reading a paragraph and then the next paragraph would jump to the next day or even the next week with no warning at all. It was the first time this has happened in all of the books I have read!<br />I also expected the sex to be steamier - it certainly should have been with the characters involved and the nature of their relationship. A few brief and basic missionary position \\"skip quickly to the end bit\\" sex scenes and this book compares itself to Fifty Shades of Grey? I think not!<br />So, all in all, it was not as good as I was hoping it would be but I still read it really quickly (a good sign for me) and found myself thinking about the characters afterwards.<br />I will read another one of her books as the author does have talent and I am hoping she she gets some good editing on the next one!<br />Oh and I do agree with the excessive violence being a bit much and the nature of their relationship being very unhealthy. But to me, this was a work of fiction not to be taken seriously and certainly not an advertisement to date a guy as seriously messed up as Travis!

1476712042|5.0|I loved this book! It was written well and I loved the characters. I loved the relationship between Abby and Travis and their relationship between their best friends. I am also so excited to read Travis's POV. Once again I loved this book and I think that everyone should pick it up and read it too.
0439023513|5.0|No spoilers - no worries.  After reading the second book i was wondering if I wanted to finish the series.  I admit i had read some of the spoiler reviews of this book and just wasn't sure.  I decided to finish the series and am glad I did. The ending will not disappoint - although it will not be as you expect.  If you aren't sure whether you should continue reading after the 2nd one - i'd suggest you go ahead.  I'm glad i did.

B000TO0TB2|5.0|I have only read this once and all three stories are complex, maybe with no true meaning per se, but I would venture to guess depending on your own experiences will have a vastly different meaning for each who read them.<br /><br />Each story plays out like a detective mystery, with various ramblings of a mundane life for the main characters, each striving to learn something about the world and it's meaning. In \\"Ghost\\" which was my favorite, Blue is living in a world with a mask,(one that the world could accept) and black is his tormented soul, struggling because he was in hiding. At some point Black decides to show himself, but he knows once revealed there is no going back. This story for me revolves around searching for truth, giving up everything in order to do so. Black begins to realize that writing is no longer serving a purpose, \\"This book offers him nothing, there is no story, no plot, no action nothing but a man sitting alone in a room writing a book.\\" Black is killed, does blue live on? He has lost touch with that part of himself, he has thrown it aside for loftier pursuits, at least that is what was implied. Why is this story called 'Ghost'? For me this implies that it is a haunting of sorts, someone who is not whole, who is tormented and who is trying to determine whether their perception of the world is real.<br /><br />Very interesting stories that leave you pondering through out, Highly recommended, but for me deserves another reading.

B0084IG8TM|1.0|(1.) Story of people being hunted, either by themselves or by others, has been overdone these past 30 years. A cheap, marketable script for a ready made, marginally intelligent, Twilight audience.<br />(2.) The forest cameras and little balls with enclosed items hanging everywhere looks good on paper but made as much reality sense as a walking/talking goldfish. Looked like a cheap aluminized plastic prop.<br />(3.) Cheap visual effects and props. Some sort of tent structure with a lot of aluminum camera cases as props.<br />(4.) Dying scenes, when shown, were shown quickly so as to not make the cheap blood effects too apparent.<br />(5.) Acting was Nickelodeon TV level teen superficial. Female, supposedly highly skilled and hunt experienced, archer seems to not know to tie back her bangs to stop them from constantly distracting/fluttering in her eyes.<br />(6.) Predictability was so over-the-top, it was embarrassing.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It was a true pleasure to read these books.  I found myself reading at every opportunity (housework went undone & phone calls were not returned until I had read all 3 books).  The character of Lisbeth Salander is like none other & you just keep wanting to know more about her, her life and what is going on in her head.  Although she has been declared mentally incompetant to handle her own affairs, she is in fact so highly intellegent that it is beyond our comprehension.  The suspense of the books has quite a number of suprising turns.  My only regret is that we will never see more incredible works from this wonderful author.

B000N3ST3Y|3.0|GENESIS-TURN IT ON AGAIN/THE HITS: The original PETER GABRIEL-helmed version of GENESIS weren't hit makers, but highly theatrical prog rockers prone to extended jams and trippy wordplay for the FM crowd. Once GABRIEL and guitarist STEVE HACKETT departed, drummer PHIL COLLINS moved out front for Top 40-friendly pop singles such as ABACAB, THAT'S ALL and INVISIBLE TOUCH, while concurrently launching an equally commercial solo career. From sublime early successes FOLLOW YOU, FOLLOW ME and MISUNDERSTANDING on through later expertly crafted chestnuts LAND OF CONFUSION and JESUS HE KNOWS ME, TURN IT ON AGAIN racks up a pleasurable though by no means definitive sampling of GENESIS' work. Glaring omissions include the moody MAN ON THE CORNER as well as the RNB-driven hotsteppers PAPERLATE and NO REPLY AT ALL...even the best known GABRIEL era effort THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY is missing in action. A so-so remake of THE CARPER CRAWLERS featuring the original lineup and the bland non-COLLINS single CONGO don't add much to the picture; let's call this a good collection that really should have been great.<br /><br />RATING: THREE MEMBERS

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Ok, so I just finished the Hunger Games trilogy. I loved the first two books in the series sooooo much. I loved Katniss, Peeta, and even Gale. They were all very strong characters and had so much potential to become so much more, especially Katniss. The plots were amazing and just kept the reader enthralled through out the two books. I found myself so drawn into the first two books that I found myself rushing home to read them;however, this was not the case with MOCKINGJAY!!! I feel like i read the wrong book and feel like I've been punk'd or something. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???? Did suzanne Collin's brain get  hijacked or something??? What the hell was she thinking writing this slop??? I feel so completely betrayed. The character development I read about in the first two books was nowhere to be found in MOCKINGJAY, Katniss was reduced to some weak and deranged girl and Peeta was made to be some lost little boy who didn't knowmwho he was. I actually found myself disgusted by these two and wanted to throw my iPad so many times that I lost count. I cannot believe the slop that was the ending, are you joking me?????! What a waste...m
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I'm a pretty critical reviewer, so this game probably deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />You use one of multiple races to build an army of various types of units, in an attempt to kill the enemy's army and capture their homebases. Each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. Each unit with each race has its own strengths and weakness. Land, sea and air units. All in all, a well stocked line up.<br /><br />Move your units through an octagon shaped grid (as pictured on Amazon) along various terrains. Each terrain type affects each unit different. For example, some units get attack and defense bonuses in the mountains...whereas other units can't even travel on the mountains. When an enemy is within attack range of your specific unit, let em have it. A small percentage is calculated which somewhat randomizes the amount of damage that will be done. Just so the exact same damage isn't done by the same unit every single time. Some units counter-attack when you attack them, some just defend. You can repair friendly units, teleport across the map, detonate EMPs, infect the enemy with toxin, convert enemy units into friendly, burrow units underground to travel undetected, and more.<br /><br />All in all, the gameplay is well done. There are three difficulty settings for the computer. Easy isn't super easy, but you'll probably beat most maps the first attempt. Medium is actually pretty darn tough. And hard is nearly impossible on most maps. There's little/no unnecessary animations to slow down gameplay. You can quickly move your units, attack, end your turn, skip over the enemy's movements and continue on with your next turn. I like this of course...... however... I would have liked to see some better graphics. This game is certainly not about graphics or anything fancy like that. It's about strategy. I get it. But still, the graphics are just ok. Very small basic units that do repetitive basic motions. To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure what I would add additionally... but I just feel it's a little lacking and that's why I knocked off a star. Maybe a little harsh. Give this game a 4.5 star rating.ut I just feel it's a little lacking and that's why I knocked off a star. Maybe a little harsh. Give this game a 4.5 star rating.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I've read his \\"Half Way Home\\" and enjoyed it. Wool was also a pleasure. Super easy to read,(pulp fiction?) finished it in about two days. There were definitely points, especially in the deep down water scene when I thought his editor should have pulled the exacto knife and cut out big pieces... but, I just flipped through the book until it got interesting again. The premise is believable (secret apocalyptic  cult  in the American south kills the entire planet), the characters interesting, and overall well paced. He's definitely got the cliff hanger ending shchtick down pat. Fun read, but great read? No. Read it once, probably never read it again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If one can concentrate on the characters, it is a terrific character study which is what I enjoy in a novel.  The graphics are pretty heavy-duty but after a while they mellow as the characters develop. Enjoyed it.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is my first review for Amazon. And I buy a lot of Blu-ray's through them. I mostly buy \\"special edition\\" items. I love to display all of that stuff in my office. Everything looks very cool. When I saw this up for pre-order way back in March I placed it in my shopping card right-a-way. I thought that it looked pretty cool to display.<br /><br />I had no idea when I opened it today how cool it looked! This is one of the coolest limited edition sets I have seen in a very long time. I am sorry, I have no idea how the picture and sound quality is of the Blu-ray's. But for me, the head alone is worth the $60! If you are a fan of the show, you owe it to yourself to get this product....before they are gone!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what I needed! it's simple and easy to use with a large display that makes the keys/numbers easier to touch with accuracy. I use this all the time!
B008BIN9EW|4.0|The other reviews go into great detail about the pros and cons, but I want my one complaint on record: There's no storyline. I love games like Fire Emblem, Starcraft, and Advance Wars, and this is a nice combination of them, but story is a major part of those games and there's no story here. Instead of 7 tutorials for each race, give me an actual campaign, with named characters or at least a hero unit or two, and a reason why each race is fighting everyone else.

B007MS5B6Q|1.0|I'm a huge Walking Dead fan....HUGE!This Zombie head was very dissapointing. It looks NOTHING like the photo...the photo of what I thought I was going to get must be the actual model done professionally. Then they mass produced something that is along those lines, but nothing like it. Beware. It's a different color and a much worse version of the Zombie head in the photo.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a blogger that I barely knew, and figured since it was $5 I'd give it a shot.  Now that I am finished, I can say that it is the best $5 that I have ever spent on anything, ever.<br /><br />I was a fan of Lost (before you go and think that I am drawing a comparison, please hear me out). At the end of season 1 when some of the survivors (Jack, Locke, etc.) are laying on top of the hatch and then the screen goes blank...... My heart raced....I had to know what was in that hatch. I remember rewinding it to watch it again and again. I called my sister and friends the next day and we discussed it over and over again.  That feeling, that sensation of being pulled along to a story line, and being so immersed that you have to know what happens is what we now call a \\"Hatch\\" moment.<br /><br />This book, has Several of these moments that just made excited to get to the next page and the next page and the next page.  I might have to create a new moment called... \\"Wool\\" Now I wish I never read it, so I could read it again for the first time.<br /><br />Thanks Hugh, fantastic story, well done<br /><br />John.
B007SGM084|3.0|This book was just ok.  Too much detail and too often.  Plot wasn't believable and didn't show up until the third book.  The only reason I stuck it out to Book 3 was because my daughter said there was a plot.  I was glad when I reached the end.

068484267X|4.0|As the memoir credited for propelling the genre into the 21st century, Angela's Ashes is a must-read for any fan of memoir-writing. McCourt's voice is distinct, and not just for his lyrical Irish lilt that sings off the page.  I found myself replying in ayes, ochs and `tises in just about every household conversation a week after setting the book down.  The dialogue subtly hints at the accent without beating us over the head with it.  I know this is a very difficult balance to strike.  You can lose a dialect in dialogue, or you can saturate it to the point of distraction.  McCourt adds authenticity to his character and his story through his true voice.  The other remarkable feature I found was McCourt's ability to subtly age his character over the course of the book.  In this memoir, we rarely hear a \\"voice behind the curtain\\" or a foresighted comment.  The narrator retains the world view and knowledge of a five year old at the beginning of the book, and he grows in perception and comprehension as the story goes on.<br /><br />Sticking with the growing-up-as-he-goes narrative strategy, McCourt does not comment negatively on the behavior of Frank's mother or father until much later in the book.  We watch Frank's father drink away the family's pittance week after week until abandoning the clan altogether.  We see his mother beg and spiral downward into deeper and deeper desperation.  Staying true to his upbringing and religion, Frank does not question or begrudge his parents until he enters his angst-ridden teen years.  It's at that turning point, after losing his innocence in multiple ways--seeing his mother begging at the church steps, having sex with Theresa, being beaten by his mother's cousin--that fully-grown anger and resentment begin to bubble forward.  He curses his absent father, doubts his religion and slaps his mother.  That pivotal slap, one that we as readers ache to bestow upon both parents, is a terrifying moment for Frank.  Although he can (and does)confess and repent, the innocent child that respected his parents and accepted his life is gone.  There is only moving forward and beyond, which for Frank is a move to America.  As we are allowed to \\"grow up\\" with Frank's voice and eyes, his transition and move is much more understandable. Angela's Ashes is a cornerstone coming-of-age memoir, a heartbreaking charmer.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout DVD is one of the best, if not the best, on the market.  I am in my mid-20s and I enjoy a fitness challenge, but I am in law school so I do not have a lot of time.  The first time I did it, I had just run my final marathon and I was looking for something that I could realistically have time to do during exams. Even though I had good cardio, I was looking for something more and this video was EXTREMELY challenging for me. These workouts, with warm up and cool down, clock in around 26:00.  If you are up at 6 you can be in the shower by 6:30 and still get a very challenging workout in.  Unfortunately, I did not eat as well as I could have the first time I did \\"the shred.\\" I lost a lot of inches but not a lot of pounds, because I was still carbing up (hard habit to break).  However, I was very happy with the way I looked by the end, because the toning in this video is very effective.<br /><br />This time around, I ate right (stuck to a 1300 calorie per day diet- I am 5'2) and the results have been even better.  The videos are still challenging even though I just did this about a year ago, but I notice more definition coming out in my abs and arms, probably because it is not covered with bloat/fat :)  It is very rewarding and motivating to see so much of a difference in a short amount of time.  I have been losing 3 lbs/week, which is right where I want to be.<br /><br />Here are a few ways to make the workouts more challenging:<br />(1) once you know the sequence of the moves, you can really jump right into the next move without waiting for Jillian and the girls to start.  Usually she moves along at a good clip, but other times I can find I get as many as 10 reps in while she is doing the set up.  Of course, you just need to make sure your form is good.  You will be amazed how this \\"adds up\\" and makes you more tired at the end.<br />(2) go faster! You might be able to hit extra jumping jacks without sacrificing form.<br />(3) Once you know the harder variations, go for it.  For example, I did double jump rope (from level 2) in level 1 when I did this for the second time.<br /><br />In addition, to increase effectiveness, I think adding a cardio session a few days a week and sticking to a diet really helps to augment this program. These are two very different approaches but they both work. As I said, I did it the first time without any tweaks and I was still very happy with the result.

1451608659|5.0|Off Balance is more than a memoir but a testament of courage, heart and determination.  You don't have to be a gymnast or even an athlete to connect with Dominique on a very personal level.  This book outlines the life of an extremely talented and driven teenager who had a dream of Olympic gold.  And the road to that dream led her through a very dark and troubled time.  While other 14 year old young women were spending hours on the phone with their friends and hanging out at the mall, Dominique was trapped behind the walls of a hot stuffy gym forced to do routines past the point of exhaustion.  Under the cruel and watchful eye of the Karolyis, Dominique's childhood was warped beyond recognition.  Who would have ever guessed that the tiny girl that once melted out hearts with her beautiful smile was plagued with sadness just below the surface?  The secret of a beautiful sister that she never knew was just one more detail in the whirlwind she was caught up in.  Dominique Moceanu fought her way through physical and psychological abuse, half starved and malnourished, to stand on top of an Olympic podium alongside 6 other amazing gymnasts with a well deserved gold medal around her neck.  Dominique Moceanu inspired a generation in 1996 and continues to do so through this amazing memoir.  Having courage to follow your dreams is hard enough in itself.  Dominique had no reassurance from parents and no support from coaches.  She did it all on her own with strength, perseverance, talent, heart and soul.  Off Balance rips open the disturbing secrets of the gymnastics world for all to see.  And in all that darkness comes the light of a star that will never dim.  Dominique Moceanu, a timeless gymnastics legend.
1400069289|4.0|This is a good book on a subject I have always been interested in-Habits. I am a true believer that habits pretty much makes you a success or failure. And in The Power of Habit,  does a great job of breaking it down.<br /><br /> My takeaway of the book is- by changing one important habit, he calls it keystone habit, that habit will spill into all areas of your life. For example, for me, I am a runner , by me continuing to run, lose weight, deal with my stress and builds my self confidence, that in turn will spill into my life and I am able to deal with life ups and downs.<br /><br />Also, my second takeway, is to look at your habits: The good ones , try to reinforce or strengthen the habit,  the bad ones. Duhigg talks about analyze it- cue, routine and reward. See what are the cues, what are the rewards, try different routine and see the rewards.<br /><br />Duhigg had great stories, my favorites were about Target and how intense their goal of knowing consumers habits and about Michael Phelps where he was to play a mental video-tape of his perfect swim before he went to bed, after he got up and do it every day. I love the story of Tony Dungy ( he told he players to simplify the plays, do one or two things great, like look at your opponent feet, his shoulder, dont over think it and rely on habits) and Rosa Parks( the reason her case stuck and others didnt was because she was a pillar of society, she belong to every club almost everyone knew her and by peer pressure, the protest became a movement- very interesting).<br /><br />Duhigg is a great writer, in vein with Malcolm Gladwell, his writing style is easy and clear. The only small beef I have with the book is that I love it when a writer ties it all up. He builds up this momentum of how important habits are in your life and you like,\\" yeah, Im with you\\" then he write a small chapter how to use it in your life by giving an example of he loves to eat a cookie in the afternoon and he change his habit of not eating the cookie. Are you kidding me?<br />Talk about trivia, when you had overwhelming information on your fingertips to use and  how people change their habits. The writer went with craving for a chocolate cookie in the afternoon?<br /><br />Why not use all the great characters and stories in his book, or at least some of the characters and tied it all together, using their examples to help people change their behaviors, like Lisa Allen( who change a keystone habit, change everything about herself in a positive way) Michael Phelps, Tony Dungy, AA, etc. Granted Duhigg did talk about in the chapter, but sum it all up. What does it all mean?  I think it means more then changing a craving  a cookie in the afternoon.<br /><br />I recommend the book, don't let my little beef change your mind about reading this book. I love his writing, the characters and the case histories. I will keep this book and read sometime in the future if I want to change any of my habits. Before leaving this review, another book I highly recommend regarding changing habits is,  Change Anything, Kerry Petterson, I read everything these authors write and they were powerfully instrumental in changing some of my behaviors.cookie.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to kill some time. I enjoy playing while at appts. or just before bed. Nice way to slow down and relax. Not too bad on the ads It's a good app to download. Try it!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great book, it's quite challenging and after reading it I decided to run my first marathon this year. Also the recipes are really good. Keep up running !!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|the second and third books were not as good as the first, a better approach would have been to combine the last two into 1 smaller book. i found myself speed reading through repetitive passages just to get to the end.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this game but I was able to go through the levels pretty quickly. A fun and pretty addicting puzzle game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is an easy read, nothing challenging about the book.  However, it is intense and makes you want to read it whenever you get the chance.  Good bedtime story ;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|couldn't live without this app! so easy to use and works great not only on my kindle but on my phone as well!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Good story, easy read and thoroughly enjoyed the action. Another Baldacci triumph! I recommend this book to anyone looking for a hero, heroine and an easy read.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I was so happy to hear they came out with a new cd. The first time I seen these guys I was at their concert I fell in love from the first song. They are amazing performers.
B0085YNML2|5.0|this is one of those games like cut the rope and where's my water; you get the free version and you just have to have the full so I got the full version I got a 25$ gift card for my birth day so I guess I was free but other wise really fun no bugs you should get it worth the money
B002OLV3CW|5.0|Love ADTR love the music and love the cover and artwork done! The tracks are great and can listen to them endlessly.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|I read the entire series as a teenager and this doesn't compare to the written word's stimulation of the imagination. Too bad, it was one of my favorite series of books. I feel this should not have been a Disney production, too bland for my taste. The books were sexier, and having John Carter be related to Edger Rice Borroughs as a story element was crossing the line for me.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Thought the battle scenes were as realistic as I have ever seen.  Good movie, well worth the time to watch
0345803485|1.0|With all the hype about this book, I just had to read it.  I'm sorry I even started it.  As a matter of fact, I never finished it.  It was one of the worst books I've ever read.  Juvenile comes to mind...a literary nightmare.  I still can't figure out what makes this book so popular.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I've read many books on creativity. Kleon injects enough humor to make the book fun to read as well as offering inspiring suggestions. Some of his suggestions are shared by other authors, but that makes them no less relevant and useful. In fact, he confirmed many of fallacies that I suspected were true, but had not admitted as being true. For example, he talks about the paralyzing idea of limitless possibilities as a sure way to douse any creative fire one might have. And it is so true. In addition, he offers solid, practical advice on living within a budget and staying out of debt.<br /><br />I will go back to read through this book many times, of that I'm sure. This is money well spent if you're in a creative field.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|2 stars for beautiful Highclere Castle and very good casting and acting; it would have been more except for the weak script and poor directing; this is no BBC Dickens series.<br /><br />For me, a web search on the characteristics a soap opera largely explains this movie.  I grew up with Soap Operas and hated them; my mother and all her friends loved them, knew all the actors and seemed to live some surrogate life through all the actors mood and personality changes that to me bordered on disorders.  According to the web, soaps have a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode.  They tend to focus their plots and story lines around dysfunctional family life, personal and sexual relationships, emotional and moral conflicts and rarely \\"wrap things up\\" storywise, and generally avoid bringing all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends there are always several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger.<br /><br />I do wish the creators had ended the series in season 1 with an additional part, I'd have given 3 or 4 stars.<br /><br />There are allusions to Christian faith in the movie and there is a Biblical concept that ones life should have have love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  What I see here are characters exhibiting hate, sadness, strife, impatience, spitefulness, relational fickleness, harshness and selfish impulsiveness and major, inexplicable personality changes.  In Season 2 Episode 8, my wife said at one point, \\"The worm turns again.\\"  I am not looking forward to Season 3 and hope like some addict we don't watch it to see what happens to (the fellow with the problem); don't want to reveal the plot.  It seems the directors can only wreck some lives and characters or resurrect a couple of dead people (that has happened in Soaps before and once in this series) to keep it going.<br /><br />However, this being said, every woman I know, except my wife, who has an opinion about this movie, loves this it (I just have not heard from men I know, even though there are some mostly positive reviews by guys).  For the most part they are very fine people with high morals and seemingly good minds.  So maybe it is just about tastes.  For my taste, give me Dickens, Band of Brothers, Master and Commander, even Enchanted April or Howards End.  I love my \\"momma\\" and her friends and were they alive, I am sure they would like this series and banter like hens about it, so how bad can it really be?
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie; it was much darker than I had thought it would be and the ending was really sad (to me at least).  Very hard to describe this but I guess I would call it a Rock n Roll Cyberpunk Action Thriller Drama.  This is definately not for young children but teenagers and adults that enjoy edgy movies will find this a winner.
B0029RZZ0W|1.0|The description really ruins this season finale.  I wasn't surprised at all, and that's disappointing!  I wish someone would remove the part that tells who William Bell is.<br />I realize 1 star is harsh, but I would definitely give it 5 stars if the description hadn't ruined it.  The part where Bell steps out of the shadows is very dramatic but would have been 100% better if it had been a surprise.  The overall story is good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sorriest book I've ever read.  Weak chracterizations and boring story-line. Skip 10 pages and you don't miss a thing. The heroine flushed too many times and her scapled tingled way too much.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|this movie has a great ending, shows the ignorance of mankind for power and a natural resource. the ending made me cry, its that good.<br /><br />The dumb and ignorant will look for anything to offend them and say its bad, reason i believe it was not massively distributed here.
1400069289|1.0|I am a neuroscientist at a US university. Charles Duhigg just sent spam e-mail to my academic e-mail address promoting his book. I can only assume that neuroscientists all over the US have received similar e-mails. If Mr. Duhigg thinks this is a savvy advertising strategy, he is very much mistaken. I will not be buying this book and have now added Mr. Duhigg to my spam filter.
0743454537|5.0|From the very first pages of My Sister's Keeper, controversy is already brought to the attention of the reader. Immediately it sucks you into this wonderful book. It is a novel full of hope, despair, confusion, and love. This book is organized in a way that one can't put the book down. As the book switches from narrator to narrator it keeps you intrigued to see what plot twist happens next because each character reveals different things. The author, Jodi Picoult, uses many quotes to introduce new chapters of the book including one from Romeo and Juliet that summarized this book's and life's struggles. \\"One fire burns out another's burning, One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish.\\" The characters in this book keep getting more obstacles thrown their way that they have to overcome, even after other impediments start to diminish. I highly recommend reading this book because it shows a family's struggle to try to stay one through very tough medical and emotional times.<br /><br />Anna, one of the main characters, describes how most babies are accidents and then says, \\"I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs and my father's sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material.\\" Anna was designed to be a donor match for her older sister, Kate, who has a rare form of leukemia. Anna is no mere accident. As Anna's family tries to save Kate from her illness, she gets put on the back burner. Anna then catches her parents' attention when she files a lawsuit against them for medical emancipation of a minor. This is just the beginning of the multitudes of drama and plot twists.<br /><br />I feel like many people can relate to the family's effort to stay sane in this book during hard times. I, as a high school senior, can relate to this book because my family has struggled for over a year to still try to have a balance. One of my younger sisters has been in and out of many hospitals due to a rare medical issue that doctors do not know how to deal with yet. It is comforting to read about a family going through a similar, but different struggle. This book goes to the top of my favorite books list because of how it consumed me throughout my whole reading experience.
0307887960|1.0|I tried this diet because the review of its reception in France was so positive. After a few weeks of this virtual no carb, no fat approach, my hair began falling out and my fingernails broke in record time. If this happened to hair and nails, what was the diet doing to the rest of my body?? As soon as I added the fat back and took a lot of B vitamins and zinc, all of these were corrected. I will say that the book is well done and the support system helped stay with the diet. BUT I do not think it's a feasible approach to losing weight and keeping it off for most human beings.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Bought for my kindle fire.  Works great.  The images are very good and doesn't seem to have any glitches running on my Kindle.  Most importantly, it keeps my daughter occupied during our long commutes!
B008A1NSTG|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  We always enjoy movies about real nature.  There where places where the movie got slow and they could have left that part out, but I would really recommend this for Nature lovers.<br /><br />According to God we are too take care of all Nature and there habitats.
0240815807|5.0|So I started putting together my home studio and thought that a quick recording and presto it was done. WRONG!!!!!!! My recordings and mixes sounded like crap! I wondered why and thought that it was the lack of plug ins. WRONG!!!!! It was my lack of knowledge when it came to mixing. Thanks to this book, I am restarting properly and feeding my mind the necessary knowledge to produce a proper mix. I am specially enjoying the links to the authors web site where he provides audio examples of what he writes. It is a definite must have if you're starting to mix. Instead of spending hundreds/thousand of dollars on plug ins, pump your breaks and spend the $25 on this book. You will not regret it and you will have a better home studio for that. Good luck!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|sons of anarchy season two or the series in general is by far the best show on television in my opinion.
0345803485|1.0|After buying this on my mother's Kindle to read while on vacation (despite the fact that I said I wouldn't read it), I have to say that I'm beyond disappointed. At first I thought I was mad; about the terribly juvenile writing, the abhorrent repetition, the obvious lack of knowledge on the part of this author about BDSM, the constant inaccuracies or the completely annoying and utterly unrealistic characters. But after much reflection, I realize what it is I'm mad about. This book is a best seller. This is what we, as women, have said is such a great read that we're recommending it to our friends, buying up copies left and right, and promoting on television. We are willing to put our hard earned money out there for this...I don't even have the words that would be appropriate to use online...and will probably do the same when the movie comes out. We have made the title such a household name that our daughters will inevitably want to read it once they are old enough to have an interest in it and believe it is good because the media told them it was. Not to mention the idea that they might actually believe this is some kind of \\"romantic\\" relationship for them to aspire to. I am horrified by the number of my very sweet, intelligent, fabulous friends who actually rave about this book. Don't get me wrong...the content of the book does not bother me at all. I'm all for a little good erotica. This was not good. It was not good erotica. It was not a good story. It was not well written. If it didn't contain any of the sex, I wouldn't even recommend it for a middle schooler to read as a love story. It's bad. The editors for this book should be publicly flogged and prevented from ever again being allowed to work in the publishing world. But yet these people; the author, publisher, and soon it will be the movie industry; they are all cleaning up on this book. They're getting the money from the women in this country, who are just forking it over and saying, \\"Well yeah, it's not the best written book, but it's good enough.\\" It's really not. I don't fault the author of this book. She had the guts to write something and put it out there and good for her. But as women, as people, we should demand a little more from our media content than this. Especially at $10 a pop. Really ladies? Really...??e best written book, but it's good enough.\\" It's really not. I don't fault the author of this book. She had the guts to write something and put it out there and good for her.

B005CWRB44|5.0|This is a great everyday carry light. It is a twisty on and off not easy to use one handed but that allows it to be shorter than the Fenix with a switch. Small sturdy and puts out plenty of light. One thing I would change is the control, it always comes on in medium then low then HIGH. When turning it on in a dark room I cover the light and turn it to low which is plenty of light indoors in the dark. When the battery is low it has a nice long taper as it slowly fades. Been in my pocket everyday for six months, will update if it lasts less that a couple of years.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Until the most recent update. Now it will freeze my kindle up. It takes a lot longer to load and it has to force close almost all the time. I didn't have one issue with it before the update.
B002BWP49C|5.0|It was super good an i cant wait to see part 2  i love these movies<br />I would not have been able to choose between jacob an edward<br />they both were hot and i would want to have both.
030758836X|5.0|Welcome to the world of Amy Elliott Dunne and her husband Nick Dunne.  On their fifth wedding anniversary, a day Amy always celebrates to the hilt, she disappears under mysterious circumstances.  Nick is the prime suspect and does nothing to make his family, the media, or the public think differently.  Thus begins a highly suspenseful tale loaded with twists and turns to keep you eagerly turning the pages.  I am in awe of author Gillian Flynn's clever plotting and now anxious to read her two previous books.  To go more deeply into the story line would involve spoilers, so I will avoid that and just say Amy and Nick are two of the most dysfunctional, psychotic people you may ever come across.  Their story is riveting, appalling, and highly readable.  A smart and stylish golden couple who complete each other in every way, their story and the inside look into their marriage will have readers mesmerized from romantic beginning until the stunning finale.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I have it for my nintendo D's. I recommend this game for kids and adults.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app its awesome. I like how it is big enough to read and shows what u added or subtracted etc.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It's very cute, I love the color of it. It looks identical to the picture and good quality. It protects my Kindle fire good and looks good at the same time. It only stands on hard surfaces though, but I guess that's common sense though.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The Walking Dead season 2 limited edition zombie head is awesome. For the price, it is something to get. The usual price for a blu-ray season ranges from $30-$60 and for the few more bucks it is worth it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I'm confident that Scalzi will not disappoint, so I would like to say that I salute Tor/Macmillan and John Scalzi for releasing this great book DRM-free.<br />Now if only Amazon would be so kind as to include in the book details section whether or not a kindle book is hobbled by DRM. It would be much easier for me to make purchases and certainly increase my business with them in the future since I now boycott such schemes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great way to get my books when my kindle is at home! no complaints just works<br />now if only they can sync it with audible
0307949486|4.0|Maybe you should take my book reviews with a grain of salt because I tend to be quite forgiving about things that others might nit-pick about.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  If you spend your evenings reading Faulner and Joyce, this is not for you.  But if you're looking for an escape with a nice plot and interesting characters, give it a go.  I finished the book over 3 days and moved right into the 2nd book in the series.<br /><br />What did I like most about this book?  I know the characters.  I have a friend that could be Lisbeth Salander (Although she probably wouldn't be my friend if she actually was Lisbeth.  I even know a Mikael Blomkvist  My point is that I can actually relate to many of his characters and for me, that makes the read much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Give it a go.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|I have always been a James Bond fan. I think that Daniel Craig is very strong in character, and longs for the missing pieces of his life, as all of us do. Love this movie!!!!
B00846TTDG|4.0|Many action films glorify war and death for the sake of the box office dollar. Other films forget that violence for violence sake has no lasting value.  Act of Valor is takes a different path.  It reminds us that there are those who will leave everything behind to fight against those who would do violence against innocents.  Men who will give up everything to protect what is good and decent and right.  It seems old fashioned, but this film is about men who will answer the patriotic call to fight for liberty and freedom.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are great but I just wish that there were easier ways to gain more coins. also it should have came with more open games.
030758836X|3.0|I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE WELL WRITTEN BUT ABOUT 100 PAGES TOO LONG. BY THE TIME I SLOGGED THROUGH TO THE END OF<br />THE STORY, I WAS PAST THE POINT OF CARING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ANY OF THE CHARACTERS (NONE OF WHOM SEEMED WORTH CARING ABOUT ANYWAY EXCEPT MAYBE FOR THE ACCUSED HUSBAND'S SISTER). FOR A MUCH BETTER AND CHILLING BOOK WITH AN ENDING THAT HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY READ \\"IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS\\" BY TIM O'BRIEN.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is great! Nice ear cushions,great bass boost and virtual surround sound.Works on all three platforms (PC,PS3,Xbox 360). I like the way you can hear yourself clearly when you speak. I actually noticed some little sounds on Modern Warfare 3, Uncharted 3, Battlefield 3, etc. that you couldn't usually hear with a regular t.v. or speaker. (It's like the sound microscope :) I can actually hear foot steps in First Person Shooters very clearly. With this headset, you can turn down the t.v. and still hear the audio through the 7.1 surround sound speaker on each ear, so this is great for any late night gamers who don't want to wake up spouses/siblings. Also, I noticed that you don't have to talk very loudly for people to hear you. I'll tell you something now, I am not replacing these for a while!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I tried out the free version and loved it so much I purchased the full version.  the sounds are great, no more ads (though they were never intrusive), and I LOVE  being able to have the sounds play in the background while I settle in reading at the end of the day.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Previous review: It was really nice while it worked, but then it bombed and never worked again. I don't know what happened to it. Too bad.<br /><br />Update: It works fine now.  I really like the globe showing light and dark.  It even picks up the seasonal shift in daylight.
B004XQO90O|3.0|that's all folks. If it was not for his performance, this movie would be, in my opinion, a complete loser. I bought this movie because the initial reviews were pretty good and I like him. I still like him. I generously gave this movie three stars solely because of Gyllenhaal's ability. This one won't get passed around.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I love this movie! I saw it over 100 times and still think this is the most hilarious movie of the year! Good story + good acting = good movie.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Samurai vs Zombies Defence is yet another great game by Glu Mobile Inc. where you control the hero of a town under siege by zombies with the help of soldiers you can summon in. Over all I would give this game 5 stars and a recomindation to all.
B0034G4P94|5.0|What a great movie! Great acting, and a great story. I loved this movie, dont know why it didnt get the hype it did. Entertaining from begining to end.
0786958731|5.0|The one- and two- star reviewers are right about these board games in at least one respect: This is not Dungeons & Dragons in the truest sense; it is drastically simplified, over quicker and, to some degree, rather mote linear. This is D&D with rubber pants, I ain't gonna lie. But that doesn't mean it's not a ton of fun. See, haters gonna hate, but this game is not for them. This game is for me and others like me.<br /><br />See, I really want to like D&D. I wish I did, because I love the concept. But in my experience (which, I'll grant you, is limited to creating a character and doing a one-player campaign), it felt too much like trying to do my taxes and read The Lord of the Rings at the same time. I just couldn't get into it and I found that really disappointing.<br /><br />Then I found out about these Dungeons & Dragons board game thingies. I looked into them and was delighted to find that it seemed much more up my alley. In the spirit of never knowing until you try, I bought the Legend of Drizzt (pronounced \\"Drist\\" by the way, thank you Google) on the basis that he's the only D&D character I'm at all familiar with.<br /><br />And man, I'm glad I did. It says something that I've so far only played the first campaign out of the included adventure book and I enjoyed it enough to play it again.<br /><br />So, let's talk content: This is one heavy box.<br /><br />-Instruction Book: A little thin, so learning can be a challenge; there isn't enough information there to address every possible eventuality. You're gonna be invoking House Rules on a few occasions.<br /><br />-Adventure Book: Something like a dozen campaigns, with enough variation to keep it fresh and interesting. There are two single-player adventures, several co-ops and some \\"vs. mode\\" stuff.<br /><br />-Tokens: Thirteen sheets of heavy-stock cardboard popouts. That's enough to make certain other board games blush (Arkham Horror, you sexy beast, I'm looking in your direction). I highly recommend a good supply of Ziplock sandwich baggies. Still, I much prefer a token system to endless scribbling, erasing and scribbling again on a character sheet.<br /><br />-Miniatures: there are quite a lot of these as well. They are used to represent the various heroes and beasties, and are moved around the build-as-you go, tile-based board throughout the game. They all look great, but there's just one problem: they're not guaranteed to all come out of the box in perfect condition. They're not likely to be broken, but perhaps awkwardly bent--one of my Drow soldier dudes is extending a sword whose blade curves sharply to the left. Likewise, the big mean angry dragon looks kinda silly with one wing sticking straight up in the air. There's probably a way to fix these that I don't know about.<br /><br />-Cards: There are 200 in total, which may sound intimidating, but after they're all separated into their various categories (even if you combine the Beginner and Advanced decks like I did), it's really not that bad.<br /><br />Well, there you have it, my review of The Legend of Drizzt board game. I hope you found it as informative and helpful as I tried to make it. I highly recommend this game if you're the right kind of person for it and if you don't expect what it isn't going to deliver. Happy Gaming!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is so entertaining. The puzzles are fun and the game does not get boring.  I like the time challange.
0425263908|5.0|I enjoyed reading the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, though not my usual type of book.  I could not put them down and wondered what I could find to continue my appetite for romance in a book.  Bared to You by Sylvia Day is a great next book if you want a little more in the romantic novel department.  It did not disappoint.  The characters are similar, but the author has more talent as a writer.

Would it be better and/or sound more authentically skynyrd w/ Leon, Billy and you name the other departed/estranged former member, most likely.  However, it is stunning and showcases a band of die hards (and hired guns)who still care enough to make the best music they can.  For all the clowns that write it off w/o giving it any shot b/c every surviving member is not a part of the current band, get real.  How many girlfriends/wives from the '70's do you still talk to?  Try being married to 6 spouses-no way it can always work; not to mention the ones that time claims.  Setting that pointless argument aside, these songs deserve to be heard and savored-they are extremely well crafted and exquisitely produced-everything is mixed w/ power and the guitars are set on stun!!  If you have ever loved the band, this is a safe bet.  If you love southern rock, it's a safe bet.  I can recommend it w/o reservation. Skynyrd may have spent the last 20+ years relying too heavily on the same classics in the live shows, but they continue to offer proof that they can write and/or allign themselves w/ excellent writers and turn out bonafide ass kicking new product. There is no reason not to support this album w/ a purchase.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 is the best thermal compound on the market. There are other types that might be better for specific purposes (Arctic C&eacute;ramique for example), but for cooling a CPU, this is the best. I've used it extensively for quite a few computer builds as well as a few 'special projects' like replacing the thermal compound on an Asus Formula X48 mother board's Northbridge and Southbridge heatsinks.<br /><br />The results are always a 4-10c drop in CPU temperatures under load. You will not notice a huge difference at idle. The real gains in heat dissipation come when the CPU is being pushed. Also, don't trust the board makers proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like RealTemp 2.41 or Everest for free (use google to find them). Either will give you more accurate numbers than Asus PC Probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.<br /><br />There are some saying Arctic Silver 5 didn't lower their temperatures. That is almost certainly because they're using it incorrectly, which I can understand since the instructions provided are minimally useful. So for those of you who are not familiar with applying thermal paste, here is the process:<br /><br />1. Remove the old thermal compound. This is accomplished by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. I recommend purchasing an ArctiClean kit. For minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.<br /><br />2. Apply a surface cleaner. You can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit. Make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.<br /><br />3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. DO NOT USE TOO MUCH! If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the CPU locking mechanism, your hands, etc... It makes a real mess. Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.<br /><br />4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly. I recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by Intel are notoriously poor. Zalman makes some great ones. Do NOT buy on that uses push pins to lock in place. You want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your CPU. This is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.<br /><br />If you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps. Just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf. The compound simply allows for a much better transfer for heat from chip-->heatsink. I swear by Arctic Silver, and I promise you it works if you use it correctly.rfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.<br /><br />3. Apply Arctic Silver 5.

B003YUF0GC|3.0|I purchased 2 of these at the same time. Both are used regularly (3 to 4 days/week, 3-5 hours per use) in moderate conditions (tropical, steady temperatures). One of the units gives no trouble; after 4 weeks of use the other one started to suddenly quit working after about 2-3 hours. Very disruptive to the work as you don't always notice that the data stopped coming in and it causes a lot of rework. I will have to order a replacement but likely not this model.
145162607X|2.0|When you buy a book by Philippa Gregory, you know a few things: the narrative will be a version of history; that version will focus on one or two key female figures, telling the tale from this unique perspective (which may be counter to what you've learned elsewhere -- even in other books by Philippa Gregory, as she does a great job of balancing differing viewpoints); and finally, the tale will be rich with detail, and will help you feel as if you are witnessing or experiencing the events first-hand -- for better of worse, in some cases.<br /><br />I was entirely prepared to enjoy The Kingmaker's Daughter; I've read all of the books in the Cousins' War series thus far, and have found them to provide a very interesting perspective on a fascinating historical period.  Of course, I am prepared to accept a certain amount of speculation when I read historical fiction -- that's part of the agreement between writer and reader.  That's not my problem with this book.  One of my objections is that some of the scenes and one of the primary plot premises (that Anne, as a late adolescent, is somehow \\"too young\\" for this or that) are just *too* anachronistic for me to accept.  Reading the exchanges between the sisters in which they endlessly addressed each other as \\"Annie\\" and \\"Iz\\" or \\"Izzy\\" became so grating; I felt as if I were reading a script for \\"Grey's Anatomy,\\" not a novel set in the 15th century. I highly, highly doubt that Isabella and Anne Neville referred to each other as Annie and Izzy.  It's a small detail, I know, but sometimes small things really wear on a reader.  For me, that was one such thing.  The Woodvilles are descendants of Melusina, a river spirit?  Great!  I love it.  Late medieval sisters call each other Annie and Izzy?  Like, gag me.<br /><br />Worse was the nonsense about Anne being characterized as \\"so young\\" and \\"just a girl,\\" etc., at the time of her marriages, as a key part of her persona and personality -- as if women of her class were not routinely wed and bred at the age of 14, if not before.  That was just nonsense, a plot device created for 21st century readers.  Most of the women around Anne would have experienced the very same thing.  (I started coming up with a list of the women in Anne's immediate social circle who were married by that age, but when I realized that it was just about everyone, I abandoned the project as tedious.)  We cannot know what they thought (and that subject, of course, is properly dealt with in the realm of fiction) but to suggest that Anne was somehow uniquely young, innocent, and thus unprepared for marriage is disingenuous and ahistorical.  Margaret Beaufort was married to John de la Pole when she was somewhere either between one and three years old, or six/seven, depending upon which source you consider most reliable -- although the marriage was later dissolved.  Now THAT is a bride who was too young!  Anne Neville at 14?  No.<br /><br />I read the book all the way through, and while I appreciated the portrait of George of Clarence, I simply did not feel that the novel actually developed into a real narrative work.  Anne, Isabella, Richard, Edward, Elizabeth Woodville, and most of the characters seemed one-dimensional, as if they'd been briefly sketched and then plugged in when the plot called for their presence.  What happened between Elizabeth of York and Richard III?  What became of Anne (as in, who/what caused her problem? [no spoilers here!])?  I suppose it's a good sign that I am asking these questions, but it's not really this novel that leaves me wanting more, but the unanswered questions of history itself.<br /><br />That said, I am sure  I will purchase and read the final installment in this series -- for one thing, there cannot be any more \\"Izzy!\\" and \\"Annie!\\" exchanges....ly wed and bred at the age of 14, if not before.

B0057A6GA6|4.0|This is a great game, very challenging esp. when you increase the difficulty.  This is one game that i have kept,and continue to play.  Keep the levels coming!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was not entertainment as I would prefer.  Instead, it was as if I was reading clinical charts of dsyfunctional patients, as individuas, and as families.  I dont watch reality TV either!<br />The style writing was effective.  Even though the material was not appealing, I just couldn't seem to put the book down.  Yet, when I did read the last page, I was mad that I had wasted time reading this book.  \\"I don't have anything else to add.  I just wanted to make sure I had the last word.  I think I've earned that.\\"
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I used to buy Sherlock Holmes in Dover Thrift editions. I thought those were a great deal until I found this collection for my Kindle. What a deal on the complete collection! It's awesome! I saw some freebies, but those were incomplete and plagued with formatting problems. This collection is very nicely formatted - better than most Kindle books that I read. Easily worth the money.
0307970868|5.0|I listened to this book on CD and Rosalyn Landor as narrator was brilliant. There is a reason why Disney currently employs her for many character voices in their films.<br /><br />This book surprised me, because after reading the synopsis of what it was about, I thought I knew how it was all going to go down. I was totally wrong. This book was howlingly hilarious and was a fresh take on the typical \\"ghost story\\". The writing was so vivid that I actually imagined this story taking place as a movie in my mind.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story, plus there are other reviews that give a summary of the plot. The main moral that I came away with from this book was that your family is your history. This book will make you want to contact your elderly relatives and ask them about their pasts.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun, heartfelt, refreshing and funny story, this is a must read.
B00384GQJO|3.0|The people trapped inside of building having to escape by figuring out puzzles has become overdone. Frankly I am a bit burned out by it all, I stopped watching Saw movies at IV because it got so bad and so far from the original, although not as bad as Halloween 3, which had nothing to do with the first two movies other than the fact it was Halloween.<br /><br />What is different about this movie which made it tolerable to watch was that it concentrated on the technicians who were operating the cube rather than the blood and guts aspect of people getting killed in imaginative fashion, although it does have some of that.<br /><br />The bad guy with the fake eye was almost cartoonish. If you sat through the other two movies and liked them, you know you are going to watch this one anyway, so why are you reading the reviews?<br /><br />No sex or nudity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have found the book very interesting, and hard to put down once you start reading. I am on the third book of the trilogy now by the same author.
B0060HLO4I|4.0|Along with his wife, Liam Neeson is in Berlin for a biotech conference. He forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this when they arrive at the hotel. He takes a cab ride back to the airport to retrieve the briefcase and has an accident along the way. Four days later he awakens from his coma, after being dead for 7 minutes. He has no ID.<br /><br />He goes to the hotel where he sees his wife, except she is with a man whp has the same name as his (Martin Harris) and he claims that he is her husband and his wife likewise makes the same claim! At this point I was divided as to what is going on. Is this a Twilight Zone where a guy goes to an alternate reality? Maybe a \\"Dark City\\" experiment. Is this an elaborate hoax? If so why is his wife a part of it? Maybe they decided to remake Hauser's Memory (am I showing my age?) Liam contacts the underground in Berlin to help him find out what is going on.<br /><br />The acting was good, as expected. The chase and action scenes were about a C+. It could have used some good swagger music, which seems to be the norm in modern movies.<br /><br />No sex or nudity. Thank you Frank Langella for keeping your pants on.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I love this game its super fun. except for I spend 3$ and it all goesdown the drain I play the game and spend the coins come back and its gone.

B0088X7YU0|4.0|Finally, something to scratch that itch we all had after seeing the original in theaters back in '97.  While this CGI installment isn't heavy on the satire/propaganda, it really comes through in terms of animation quality and action.  Most importantly, it delivers the familiar goosebumps as the troopers brace themselves for landing in the dropships.  If you're a fan, it's a can't miss.

B00899E5B4|5.0|I read the reviews of this album online before I had a chance to listen to it. Most were critical and offered a few accolades out of \\"respect\\" for Joe. First, let me tell you, if you think you're going to buy an album from Joe that sounds like \\"So What\\", you need to get over it. It's 2012 and Joe is 64 years old. This album stands on it's own and it sounds great. There is a lot of great guitar work in it - some spectacular - especially in \\"Spanish Dancer\\" and \\"Funk 50\\". The album is mildly reminiscent of the later Walsh albums laced with personal anecdotes and observations, like \\"Songs For A Dying Planet\\" and \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\"; however, the guitar work and song composition on this album far EXCEEDS any found on those two albums. Overall, a very entertaining and fun album, not too silly to be taken seriously, not too serious to prevent be enjoyed. I've been a fan since I was a little kid in the 70's and was really pleased with this album. \\"Lucky That Way\\" is a nice reprise to \\"Life's Been Good\\" from a humbled and appreciative artist who has been around the block a few times. Many thanks Joe!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, couldn't wait to read the second book and now that I'm almost finished reading book two, I can't wait to read the third book. The author makes you feel as though you are the characters in the book, it's like really being there through each scene. I would advise everybody to read the trilogy.  E. L. James is an awesome author, can't wait until she publishes another book.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I think that this album was just Madonna way of returning to her roots. I love the album name. I think it's pretty neat. But the only problem I had with this album is the only highlight of the cd was Give me all your luving and the remix. Those are the only 2 songs I gave  5 stars to. I had some 4's. But in all the album was Madonna going back to her roots
0805092447|5.0|Brown Bear, Brown Bear What do you see...I see...This is a terrific book.  I am 70 years and still remember the book and the rhymne.  I'm giving it to second generations.  Thank you very much Amazon for another great book.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|All I can say on this album is, SHE DID HER THANG! I mean she just went in! I think this album should have did better chart wise and I don't understand why people think this album flopped because it didn't! But anyway like I said before...SHE DID HER THANG!
1881273873|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend and myself. It really helped us both to not only understand our own Love Language but how to better communicate to each other in our love languages! I really do recommend this book to any single or couple dating to read together. Communication is vital in any relationship. What better gift to give the person you love or yourself than understanding and better communication... We were a newer relationship with no problems but we both agree we have had a smoother relationship than any in our past after understanding each others love languages now!!!!
B007DIQB50|3.0|Well Nicki's first album was off the chain so I thought the second album would be. I was wrong! As soon as I heard Stupid Hoe I felt like her second was going to be better than her first and I was wrong. It was too poppy for me, especially if you are a rapper. The only highlights on the album was Stupid Hoe and Beez In The Trap. I think she could have did better but I'm going to keep being a fan because she really is a good artist!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love it its so much like world of war craft and that's awesome if only the made it so you can open more then 5 chests but that's fine go game make higher levels Pps ty this game roock
B0061PEAUY|2.0|This book misses the mark.  Like other reviewers I found myself wondering if this was Reichs' work.  The story bounces between hard to read (four dead infants) and boring (tedious descriptions of diamond mining).  Reichs usually builds a 'can't put down plot' with forensic details and surrounds it with an interesting mystery.  These elements are missing here, as are the elements of Brennan's personal life that make this a cohesive series.  Even long time fans of the series can skip this and miss nothing.  Not recommended.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|This is a MUST for all Murakami lovers. Very well written. As always. I can strongly recommend all 3 books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Book was actually great reading from the begining to the end,at times I found it hard to put down...
B004CFBMRY|5.0|This was not only an interesting story but inspirational also. It explores all that we are lead to believe by mass advertising and consumerism and makes you realize that these are things we don't need to complete what is rightfully ours by nature - running. It's the only book I've read twice .... back to back :)
0981951252|1.0|I don't often write reviews on Amazon unless I find an outstanding product or a really terrible one.  Unfortunately this falls into the latter.  I have tried to listen to this audiobook several times but always find myself getting irritated with it.  The endless self promotion and name dropping (\\"Montel told me...\\", \\"Donald Trump told me...\\") got annoying very quickly.  A few days later, I'd tell myself to keep an open mind and listen again. But I still ended up getting annoyed listening.<br /><br />The advice that Darren Hardy gives is nothing new if you've read any personal development books before. But thats ok. Sometimes its good to listen to the same ideas again to get a new perspective or feel inspired to take action.  But Darren Hardy did little to inspire me.  In fact, he came across as shallow and superficial.<br /><br />The Compound Effect is basically about taking daily consistent action to get outstanding results over the long term.  I would HIGHLY recommend The Slight Edge by Jeff Olsen instead.  If you want to read a classic on personal development then I'd recommend Think & Grow Rich by Napolean Hill. Or read books from Tony Robbins, Jack Canfield or Brian Tracey.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Jan61<br />Hope this app is as much fun and challenging as the other app Call of Atlantis. I believe it will be so I'm going to give it a four star.

B003Y5H5EW|1.0|Get ready Underworld fans to hate this review. The Underworld franchise has been on a downward slope since the first one and this was the worst. Sure it still maintains the same Kate Beckinsale in the same slick black tight suit looking impervious to everything including bullets and claws. The movie is soaked in darkness, tones of blue and gore. Don't think you'll see any green here, just blue with hints of red splattered blood. The plot is paper thin like an 80s movie of having Arnold Swartzenager invade a compound and kill everyone. Well this movie Kate invades a compound and kills werewolves like she's an exterminator. Why? For a new girl that joins the cast and doesn't seem to have much to do with anything. It feels tacked on like they couldn't have her save her beloved boyfriend again. This is a cool and gory movie without much substance. Terrible dialog and even worse logic like how would a girl raised in a lab know what a mom and dad are to even know who her mom and dad are? Why would the fiendish lycan company bent on using this kid even tell the kid what a mom and dad are? Why bother teaching her English? Whatever. The girl doesn't even show up until 30+ minutes into the movie making me wonder why everyone is willing to instantly die for her. Everything seems thrown together with no cohesion. I'm not exactly why Kate is trying to save the girl other than the obvious she's Kate's daughter but Kate doesn't remember having her.<br /><br />The movie excels at cool, gorey deaths and action... but so much of it that you grow numb by the end. The body count is probably near 100, but Kate remains unharmed. Its like watching Superman in a woman's body who can't fly with bad dialog. In fact she even brings someone back to life by touching his heart literally. Speaking of plunging her hand into someone's stomach to get to their chest... when she does it, there is no blood on her snow white hand afterward.<br /><br />I'd probably feel different about the movie if any of the cast could convey any sort of emotion other than brooding badassery. Not even the child can convey some sense of weakness or emotion, she's too busy killing everyone too! Maybe that's just the vampire stereotype that they have no emotion... just like there is a stereotype that vampires hate sunlight, yet Kate Beckinsale can be out there in the daytime because 'it because it was a gift.' If only this character wasn't Superman. If only she had any kind of weakness or frailty. Even Superman has kryptonite, Indiana Jones had snakes, even the Terminator can be killed. Heck you can even strip her of her automatic pistol to show some sign of weakness. Pretty easy to kill lycan when all vampires are equipped with pistols and all werewolves are just brutish beasts without weapons.<br /><br />Pass this movie unless you need a good laugh and eye roll. I just can't suspend my disbelief this much. Feel free to write and tell me how awesome the movie is and how it is in your top 5 films of all time.

034580404X|2.0|Author has potential, needed a better editor. The SM, Bondage scenes add nothing to the novel. If the aim was to get people to acknowledge an alternative lifestyle, he succeded. Well developed characters but author resorted to the trite dime store villain and abused protagonist formula. The female character could have been explored in more depth.

0345803485|1.0|I am not particularly surprised by the commercial success of this novel, since it is clearly marketed to titillate a mainstream audience. However, I take exception to the incredibly poor quality of the writing. I purchased the novel in order to be able to respond to my students, many of whom I know will have read it over the summer. I teach English literature at the university level. This novel is not written for an educated reader. I spent the first third of my reading experience wanting to edit every page. Then there is the problem of the supposedly erotic content; pardon me while I stifle a yawn. For anyone who has any knowledge of BDSM, this book suggests erroneously that everyone who participates is somehow emotionally damaged. Sadly, this book feeds that cultural misconception. I will not be rushing to read the next instalments. The author will, undoubtedly, make a great deal of money for her efforts, which is clearly her aim in writing this 21st century Harlequin Romance. There is a plethora of erotic writing to be had if one cares to look for it; this, however, is not it.

B0000501C3|4.0|Saw a show on the box about the history of the French kings and Versailles and remembered seeing this film when it was first released. Tracked down this soundtrack and I like it a lot. I like some classical music, probably what the true classic afficionados would call the \\"popular classics\\", but whatever it works for me. It conjures up a time or what we perceive of that time in history and it is amost foot tapping in a way. Also from someone whose musical intersts covers a lot of bases - especially blues - it has bounce and a beat and the tracks are all short so you dont get bored.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Much like Where's My Water. It's challenging, but not too challenging. It's just enough to make you have to think a little bit, but not so much that it ceases to be fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a really fun game! its also very addicting :) the only thing I would like to see change is adding a volume on/off switch. I like listening to music while I'm playing games, and I cant stand the grunting. otherwise, its an awesome app :)

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This movie is about a sushi chief who achieved the Michelin 3 star award, the toughest in the restaurant business. He is so intense into food choice and preparation.  You won't believe it until you see it.  Example: He doesn't buy rice from the store for his sushi. He buys the rice from a rice dealer and this rice dealer doesn't sell the particular rice to anybody who asks, even if they can afford it. Crazy.

B007N31ZDI|5.0|Loved it when it came out in the theaters.  Bellushi is a classic.  The extras just add to the fun.  So many now famous people in this movie.  It is a must see for any fraternity seeking individuals.
1452101426|5.0|This is another great addition to the \\"Art of Disney\\" series. The background story and information about the movie-making process if very interesting. There's a lot of concept art design and sketches. Of course, the beautiful artwork is amazing.
0345803485|2.0|Unfortunately, my order from Amazon never arrived (refund already applied to my account) so I borrowed the book from a friend.  After reading all of the hype about it, I was glad I didn't pay to read. Not well written.  Amateur porn at its worse.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This app version is clearly NOT AD-free... in fact the ads in this version are bigger and even more annoying than the ones in the regular free version. plus it deleted all my progress. luckily I was backed up and able to restore all and UNINSTALL this crap.
B000053W01|5.0|I love, love, love this CD. It is perfect and find myself singing to ALL of the songs. It shipped very fast and packaged very well.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game! I like it very much, but you gotta be fast! Quite the challenge! Great for anyone with good peripheral vision, as some of these boards are large and spread out.
0553293397|5.0|I read the Asimov's robot stories many years ago. (while I was in high school). While many of the details in the stories are now dated the ideas presented are still worth thinking about. The pace of the books is also from a less frantic time. Well  worth the time to revisit an old friend.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! I like the fact that each sound has its own volume so you can have the sounds you like the most just a little louder! I would recommend this one!
B008FOB124|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, spiritual and textural, this is a great release from Dead Can Dance.  I have been a big fan of DCD for many years and was not disappointed by \\"Anastasis\\" in any way. I've listened to it non-stop since purchasing it and it reminded me of why this duo has meant so much to me for many years now.  A must for DCD fans!!
B001S49AQW|2.0|I usually love historical romances but this one is not going to make my list of good books.  This book moves slowly and is filled with slang that makes the dialogue very difficult to understand.  I like sharp, witty repartee rather than long, involved passages that just drag on and on.<br /><br />If you understand the slang and don't mind dialogue that just drags out seemingly forever, then you may enjoy this book.<br /><br />I prefer a book that moves and this one, for lack of a better term, languishes.
1400064627|4.0|The readers who describe these characters as \\"typical Southerners of their time\\" award a huge tribute to Fannie Flagg.  More than a few of these characters are larger than life.  This might be a compendium of the best stories of a mid-size town over a lifetime, but it would be hard to imagine this much plot in the lives of a half dozen closely linked people.  Then again, the narrator doesn't hide the importance of exaggeration and outright tall tales to good storytellers in the Southern context.<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes makes an excellent period piece with great local color.  It may be too populist to qualify as \\"Literature\\", but the story will expand your mind and warm your heart.  Flagg makes us loves them all, of all ages and persuasions, from the hothead grandmother with the frying pan, to her relative who covers for her, to the iconclast who tries to shield him, to the preacher who perjures himself to rescue her, to the judge who can see the book in the \\"preacher's\\" hands is no Bible and decides to let them all get away with it anyhow...<br /><br />Sometimes we conclude \\"you just can't make this stuff up.\\"  Well, I don't know...  Me, I think you'll have to read this story for yourself to believe it.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|Very good book, it really shows you how Korean people are living. I thought the regime was like in the book. What I was not aware of was the fact that the Korean people live like in a gulag. I pity them and hope the regime falls for the people. Very good book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The movie was filmed in my small beach town.  Reading Safe Haven was so enjoyable, then viewing the sites from the book made the story so alive.. Mr Sparks was so right on in his view of Southport, NC<br />it made our town glow with excitement this summer.

B001NLKZUA|4.0|It seems like there is always so much going on in these books. So much action, so many questions, and so much everything.<br /><br />You follow the gang again, Jace, Clary, Simon, Luke and Isabelle as they look for and fight against Valentine. Valentine has a plan to do something crazy with the Angel Sword, in which he needs the blood of four downworlder children, 1 fairy, 1 vampire, 1 werewolf and 1 warlock. And the gang needs to stop him before he does and can then control an army of demons to bring down the Clave.<br /><br />There are some new characters this time, the werewolf Maia, who I think will come back in the next book, and Imogen the Inquisitor who is at times ruthless and crazy, and then at times strong and fearless.<br />You learn more about Jace and Clary and what their father did to them, I guess while they were still in utero. I like this twist, and cant wait to learn more about how they are special.<br /><br />The awkward Jace/Clary romance was weird... and confusing. Though I cannot wait to see what happens with them that makes their attraction ok.<br /><br />You got to meet some Fairies in this book, and even the Queen of the Seelie Court, who was cruel and ruthless as well.<br /><br />I liked the way the Simon/Clary thing went.<br /><br />This book had a lot of demons, and some CRAZY demon/Shadowhunter fights, which were entertaining and exciting.<br /><br />I didn't like that Clary's mom STILL is not awake and that she wasn't in this book... like at all. BUT from the Epilogue, apparently she will be in the next book. Hopefully.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book, just as much as the first. At times I felt like it was a bit much... everything that was going on, but it was exciting and I enjoyed it. Am about to start the next book!<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />Review by Mrs Jones [...]
B003B0D2QU|5.0|I am only half way through this book, but it's already become painfully clear why Dinesh D'Souza titled his book, The Roots of Obama's Rage. I now see a rather frightening side of the President that perhaps explains some of his decisions and actions. He does not hesitate in sharing the radical influences of those he encountered during his education and he is forthcoming about the confusion, anger and resentment toward those he perceives are complicit in the suffering experienced by himself and those with whom he shares a kindred spirit.<br /><br />The book is engaging, but it appears that either Obama took a creative writing class seriously or he had a ghost writer spruce his narratives. Here's an example, \\"I rose from the couch and opened my front door, the pent-up smoke trailing me out of the room like a spirit. Up above, the moon had slipped out of sight, only its glow still visible along the rim of high clouds. The sky had begun to lighten; the air tasted of dew.\\"<br /><br />I frankly don't know why I waited this long to read this and believe that every person voting for or against him should so they might have a better understanding of who is and what makes him tick.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you about The Walking Dead if you haven't already seen it, because the plot<br />is filled with surprises--not just thrill points but shocks that reboot the set of human relationships<br />at the core of this show. Yes, it's zombie apocalypse. But it's mainly about how people treat each other<br />when the world breaks and you have the choice of making new rules to live by or going down. This is an<br />absolutely brilliant series, because the characters are richly drawn. You may find yourself admiring<br />someone you at first hated, or mistrusting someone you believed in absolutely. I thought this second<br />season was particularly interesting because so often I thought what someone was doing--which would<br />affect the survival of the others--was so utterly wrong. You get incredibly drawn into the action<br />because the actors are so persuasive. It's almost as if you were one of this band of survivors, depending<br />for your life on someone who might at any moment make the worst possible decision. I can't imagine<br />what it's like watching these shows at intervals. I waited for the DVDs and then devoured them.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|It was a good movie. But once I realized that it was catering to the high school crowd, it took away some of the 'like' but I still enjoyed the movie. The high school cliches and \\"Blair Witch Project\\" camera actions were annoying but I have to applaud someone coming out with a new story line and making an original movie that hasn't been redone or have 10,000 \\"super actors\\". I also like the diversity in it. Altogether I think this was a good movie even though I'm glad I caught it on DVD other then shelling out $10+ at the theater.
1573225517|5.0|This was Hornby's first novel and while he shortly thereafter became famous for _About a Boy,_ this one is also very much worth your while. (The NEW YORK TIMES obviously thought so, too, and named it a \\"Notable Book.\\") Rob, now in his mid-thirties though sometimes easily mistaken for an adolescent, is a pop music maven whose used records store, Championship Vinyl, is just barely getting by. He has two part-time employees who are even more like Rob than he is himself, and all three of them are devotees of \\"Top Five\\" lists and making compilation tapes. So Rob opens his story -- his confession, really -- with his personal Top Five Most Memorable Split-ups, beginning with the first girl he made out with at the park at age thirteen and who dumped him after six hours. Charlie, the fourth entry on the list, was the first one he was really in love with in his late teens, and when she trashed him, he flunked out of his technical school and found himself in the line of work in which he still struggles. But most recently there's Laura, with whom he's been living for two years and who has now gone off with the bloke from the apartment upstairs. And that's really killing him. This particular heartbreak he finds he simply can't deal with. The realization doesn't make him any smarter, though. Can he get her back? \\"If I can get her to concede that there is a chance we'll patch things up, that makes things easier for me; if I don't have to go around feeling hurt, and powerless, and miserable, I can cope without her. In other words, I'm unhappy because she doesn't want me; if I can convince myself that she does want me a bit, then I'll be okay again, because then I won't want her, and I can get on with looking for someone else.\\" Because Rob always is careful to keep his options open and tries hard never to take responsibility for anything. You're less likely to get hurt that way. You're also more likely to be permanently lonely. Not to mention, someone you really commit yourself to, even marry, might leave. Might die. \\"Best not put yourself in that position. Best leave it all alone.\\" Rob isn't stupid at all. He just tends to \\"get lost in his head,\\" as Laura finally points out. \\"You just sit around thinking instead of getting on with something.\\" Maybe, Rob finally decides, a real life that resembles an episode of _thirtysomething_ wouldn't be all bad.<br /><br />Hornby possesses a marvelous wit in the dry, self-deprecating, and slightly stammering English tradition. Explaining to a visiting low-tier American girl singer/songwriter (who, for some reason he can't quite grasp, seems to actually like him) why he spent his birthday almost completely alone: \\"Say it was your birthday today, and you wanted to go out for a drink tonight. Who would you invite? Dick and Barry? Me? We're not your bestest friends in the whole world, are we?\\" \\"Come on, Rob. I'm not even in my own *country*. I'm thousands of miles from home.\\" \\"My point exactly.\\" Or, talking about his rather dull, rather stodgy, parents: \\"I wish I wanted to see them more, but I don't, and when I've got nothing else to feel bad about, I feel bad about that.\\"<br /><br />Hornby used to be accused of writing the male equivalent of chick lit (it was no accident the film of _About a Boy_ starred Hugh Grant), but his more recent work, such as _A Long Way Down,_ is considerably more sophisticated. Still, this book is where it all began and it's very much worth the reading.even marry, might leave. Might die. \\"Best not put yourself in that position.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Anyone who purchases this will obviously be a fan of the show, so I won't go into much a review there (in short: awesome show, definitely something you need to be watching if you aren't already).<br /><br />Now on to the limited edition packaging. I received mine yesterday when I got home from work (great surprise). The box was huge but I couldn't see the item being that big-well it was pretty big (three boxes kind of like a Russian Doll effect); and when I finally got into the main box I was trying to suppress my excitement not trying to get my hopes up thinking it wasn't going to be that nice in person. Well I was definitely excited once it was out of the box! It looks SOOOO cool sitting on my shelf! And the quality is surprisingly good-my only concern was the screwdriver since that is made of wood (feels like wood anyways) so I get nervous when jabbing the walker in the eye to open it for the movie that it may eventually snap, so I think I will just keep the DVD with the rest of my DVDs and just keep him in all his glory showing off on my shelf.<br /><br />I definitely thnk this was an awesome idea for them to do and glad I bought mine. I definitely recommend anyone who is a fan of the series to definitely purchase before they're gone and you're reduced to paying A LOT more on eBay or even from other sellers on here.<br /><br />Go buy it!!! You won't regret it!!!!
B007WFR0QS|4.0|As much music is out there, sometimes it feels like it's tough to find 'new' music.  Came across her name from a blog entry I read somewhere.  Bought the CD not knowing what to expect.  LOVE IT.  My title was 'Thank You' because I was glad that this was a CD that had actual music, lyrics, arrangements and talent.  No autotune, no bubblegum BS, etc.  This CD has been played numerous times and I hear something new each time.  THANK YOU Emeli for bringing music back!

1449408656|2.0|I recently read through this book having only very little knowledge about the webcomic. I had seen posted on several social networking sites the differences about human connecting to dogs and connecting to cats, and it looks like you can even buy a poster of said comic from the Cat vs. Human online shop. With that, I thought this might be worth a look. I love cats, have a cat myself, often talk about getting more cats with my girlfriend or just mostly discuss that anytime either of us even fathom of having a child, we should just get another cat instead. I can relate to pretty much everything in this book.<br /><br />Yet... I didn't like it all that much.<br /><br />Some of the humor is funny. Most of it is just stuff that, to me at least, felt like the joke was an easy punchline. Nothing that I haven't seen a million times on the inside of a greeting card. So for me, reading through this, a good deal of it starts to sound like jokes my mom passes off in normal conversation about her crazy cats. I hear it all the time, I live it all the time, and it has ceased to be all that funny. It's on the same level of \\"Have some coffee with your sugar\\", \\"Those jeans don't make you look fat - your ass does\\", or any of those other little idioms that even my grandmother has somehow worked out and repeated to death.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the book. I love supporting indie comics, webcomic published releases, and general cat-related literature, but this just isn't for me. This would make a great gift for your mother if she's the kind of person who reposts every cat macro she sees on Facebook or still sends out e-mails with funny pictures attached (Who does that anymore?). It's not really funny as it is familiar. I also have an issue with it as I suspect that a lot of drawings are just copy/pasted into the panels. I'm not saying that the artist didn't draw them, I have no doubts that she did, but I seem to see the exact same poses of the dog and a few of the cats throughout several comics which makes me think that a good deal of these comics don't even have enough effort put into them to be drawn let alone be original and witty.<br /><br />I even tried checking out the Cat vs. Human blogspot page; the recent stuff's drawings seem to be better, but the content is still a bit of the same. Just skip this. I would recommend the \\"I Can Haz Cheesburger\\" book instead, you'll get far more laughs and tons of cute cats. This book isn't bad, I personally did not care for it though.
0307591549|5.0|My son recommended this book and I found it to be exceptional.<br />It is a must read for business executives, recent college graduates, and anyone who wants to improve their work ethic and advance.<br />Students floundering will improve their study habits if they read the book.<br />Somethings seem obvious but in total a great read.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I'm going through my third pair in the last couple years. Yes, they are not PARTICULARLY durable, since I exercise a lot. The speakers and wires corrode from sweating. But I never had poor sound from wires falling out, despite knocking them off my head constantly while running around the gym.<br /><br />You get a great balance of bass and mid-range. Not too much treble boost, which is distracting when you're working out. Of course, I'm not comparing them to my Beats Studio...<br /><br />Positives:<br />- PRICE!<br />- SUPER light and compact<br />- above average sound<br /><br />I'm buying two this time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I did not think about reading this book because I hate to read and practically I do not have enough time.  But then one of my coworkers started to read it and told me about how good it was.  As soon as I started reading I did not stop!  It was soooo enticing and exciting!!!  Before I new it I had finished all three!!!  I have now recommended the book to others to read and they love it too!!!  I was so upset when I finished!  I did not know what to do with my time and I wanted to keep venturing into the Grey's life!!!!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Despite having such an great and iconic character, Lee Child has recently struggled to avoid repeating himself with his Reacher stories.  But somehow he always delivers a satisfying and entertaining read.  But this one is a brave and successful attempt to try something different.<br /><br />A murder in the middle of no-where and the bad guys decide having an additional person in the car may help them get past police roadblocks.  Luckily they spot a hitch-hiker, not quite so luckily it's Jack Reacher wanting to head out of Nebraska and towards Virginia.  The first half of the book is either placed in the car as Reacher realises there is more to the occupants then he first assumed or back at the crime scene where various agencies arrive with differing levels of knowledge and agenda.  Key is a female FBI agent, almost a female image of Reacher  who is the lead investigator.<br /><br />The second half of the book has our agent catching up with an abandoned Reacher and another shocking murder puts them firmly on the trail of the bad guys.  As the reader we are treated to the usual short sentences, the menace of Reacher and the bleak American landscape. (And by the way, try reading with Springsteen's Nebraska or Darkness at the Edge of Town on in the background, they are almost soundtracks to Reacher's wandering).  We also know there is a fair bit of mystery around the original murder and the background is gently released throughout the book, so as Reacher gets nearer to the bad guys, we get to finally understand the full picture.<br /><br />With the exception of some strange blinking Morse code that felt like Lee Child was trying to be too clever, this whole books works very well and the car scenes are very taut and claustrophobic. A welcome addition to the series.<br />(Review from the UK hardback copy)
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Plug it in, get really fast speed. Looks durable, slender, what's not to like?<br /><br />Infinitely faster than the old USB adapter and 1/3rd smaller.<br /><br />If you need high speed ethernet and video out you need a docking station (should be out soon), but for my purposes this is great.<br /><br />So now what do I do with my USB adapter?
0307346617|3.0|Undoubtedly I can see why and how people enjoy this book, I even found myself immersed from time to time. However the \\"Oral History\\" style of writing just didn't do it for me, its a new short story after ever (at most) 10 pages. All of these short stories greatly vary in how engaging they actually are. Overall it's an OK book but I never once found myself reading more than planned or eager to continue the book. Having one short story after another never really gives you the chance for predictions which I personally feel is the most fun part of reading, those predictions I make always encourages me to continue the book.
0345522478|5.0|Love this series- reminds me of the Dresden Files books by Jim Butcher. This is a series you'll want to keep.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I'm a 14 year old girl who dislikes adventure books but this book caught my eye because it has mythical creatures the same as the Harry Potter series. This book is also like the Harry Potter series but different.<br /><br />Harry Potter has a aunt, uncle, and cousin who not only despise him, but is cruel with him, although Percy Jackson has only a mean stepfather. Also, Percy and Harry are alike because they both go on exciting adventures with their 2 great friends, for Harry, it was Hermione and Ron, for Percy it was Annabeth and Grover.

The zookeeper struggles with a decision between doing what he loves, which is tending to the zoo animals, or impressing his lady friend with a more flashy job and lifestyle. The animals try to help him with his love life and offer some suggestions from the animal kingdom. It's a cute show.

B006LSZECO|2.0|It's a very simple novel.<br />The writter just wrote something for selling and without literary value.<br />Don't waste your time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch has a wonderful \\"minimalist\\" approach to his writing.  Very little fluff which moves you right into the action.  I loved the way this book continued to spin you deeper into the appalling mystery of this \\"perfect\\" town.  With flashbacks that actually work and a protagonist you truly care about, this is a book I'll be recommending to friends.
1401937519|5.0|I was a little skeptical when Hay House sent me Anita Moorjani's book to review, the story detailing how she had miraculously healed from cancer after an NDE (Near Death Experience). I'm an open-minded person, but I couldn't help but be a bit cynical of someone who had organ failure as a result of a long battle with cancer one moment and the next moment was completely cancer-free. Although I was intrigued.<br />[[ASIN:1401937519 Dying To Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing]]<br />As I began the story, I read of Anita's early childhood and adolescence and the conflicting messages she felt torn between regarding cultures and religions as she grew up with an Indian background living in Hong Kong. As she tried pleasing everyone around her, she ended up losing herself. After two people close to her were diagnosed with cancer,  she was absolutely terrified of getting cancer herself . Being a firm believer that your thoughts manifest the things in your life, it came as no surprise to me that she was eventually diagnosed with the disease.<br /><br />Anita takes you on her journey of healing, through the diverse methods of holistic healing she tried, from Chinese herbs to an ayurveda guru in India and everything in between.  She doesn't omit the fact that many of these modalities contradict one another, which makes the path to healing even more confusing and frustrating when you are trying to find the 'right' way. The more techniques she incorporated, the sicker she became.<br /><br />Anita's account of her NDE is quite beautiful and her realizations profound. She states, \\"In truth, I'm not my body, my race, religion, or other beliefs, and neither is anyone else. The real self is infinite and much more powerful - a complete and whole entity that isn't broken or damaged in any way.\\" And,  \\"I'm at my most powerful when I am working with life rather than against it.\\"<br /><br />I am grateful Anita has the courage to share her story. Even if you are skeptical like I was before reading the book, you can still benefit greatly from her words of wisdom on how to live your life fearlessly. No NDE required.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am usually not a fan of fiction, but I couldn't put this down.  It was like watching a movie and wanting to know the ending.  Sex,love, betrayal,money...all the things which make the world go round... and fantasy.

B00190N4G2|5.0|Excellent selection and  quality of an old movie. Really enjoyed watching a movie from my childhood in good quality. Thank you for providing this title. Would like to see more from this time period.
B005OLUOVA|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase, metal box came in without a dent and very sleek, the metal slide of the booklet has a little rust forming which adds character. This might not be such a great purchase for someone that owns every single album physically,  but I love the remastered versions that just sound deeper and louder. What makes this a solid deal for me though are the three DVDs with the videos and their 'Making of' parts. The picture booklet made me chuckle and laugh, but also it made me acknowledge Rammstein's progress over the years, something any fan will truly appreciate. Overall, a true fan will greatly enjoy having this in their collection.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved reading this book! As someone who has a close friend diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer, it was truly an inspirational read.  I found myself not wanting to put it down.  You don't have to be diagnosed with cancer to want to read this book. The author's views can be applied towards anyone dealing with their fears, any kind of fear.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|As we watched this powerful drama based on the true life story of a young woman and the resilience of her family, friends, church and community in the shadow of tradgedy turned into triumph and blessings.<br />No one, especially a parent wants their child to go through a similar horrific incident, but the determination shown by all was nothing short of heroic....<br />A must see film...!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app works better than other weather apps with no fuss settings. I would recommend for almost any tablet user.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does all it says it does, and beautifully.  Extremely appealing graphics, I enjoy watching the battery charge now!  And it's free--thanks!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|this game was pretty hard but fun. Also its just like pretty pet salon Wichwas kind of disappointing. for me....but other wise this game was awesome
B004EPYZQC|1.0|Why do so many guys like this movie? Vin Diesal is an awful actor! He thinks that good acting is strutting around flexing his big bulging biceps, knocking guys out to prove how big and bad he is. The stunts in this movie were kind of funny to me. Like how he and Paul Walker manage to survive that fall off that cliff jumping off the hood of the car! And how when the bad guys catch them and cuff them to the ceiling Vin Diesal easily breaks out of the cuffs and pounds the dudes to a pulp! Hmm yeah right? Paul Walker is a great actor but he gets easily overshadowed by big bad Vinny! They shouldve gave him a stronger role. Loved The Rock too! He was able to keep his machismo under control. I cant believe they're making a 6! Stop already!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the app is very easy to use and the reading plans are great. The Bible app is a great tool to help improve your spiritual life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found this book to initially be really slow. It actually took me a couple of days to get thru the first couple of chapters because it was such a drag. I found it to be hilarious when she was walking in his office and fell inside.  Who does that, I was embarrassed for her and her clumsiness.<br /><br />I did not care for Christian Grey in this book and Anastasia was too naive and uneducated about relationships. Why he took her to the red room was beyond me. Just from reading the book and the conversations earlier I knew she was a virgin before she told him. Then he caught an attitude, REALLY.....most men would be flattered. I'm not going to even discuss there first time because there was nothing romantic about it.  I feel like he stole her innocence even though he didn't rape her. Most of us envision our first time being special well hers was not. Even though I did not like how he handled her, I have to admit he was very knowledgable and in tune to what her body needed to take her over the edge.<br /><br />I will say that Anastasia definately had a lot more patience than me because I would have told him off and left in so many occassions. I can understand the NDA, I probably would have signed that but definately not the contract.<br /><br />OMG, that was the best ending ever and it picks right back up in book two. I was so proud of her for finally speaking up and stop allowing him to dominate her. Way to go Anastasia!!!!<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book and I have recommended it to friends. The only thing I hate was the constant phrases being repeated. She bit her bottom lip, he pushed her hair behind her ear, his mouth formed a thin line, laters baby and etc.<br /><br />NY
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was reallllllllllllllly cool!!!!!!!!!!  I. loved it ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yaw ya ya ya ya
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Actually, I found this book to be interesting from beginning to end. Anastasia was still naive but she was gaining a voice and opinion in this book. I'm glad it picked up right where book 1 left off.  Christian Grey was a very troubled individual and was too possessive of her. Some of his actions could have seemed to be romantic but he was just to much.....I felt like he was a stalker.<br /><br />Why she allowed him to remain to have a friendship with Mrs. Robinson was beyond me.  I enjoyed reading this book but I do not think I will watch the movie. Anastasia lacks confidence in herself and her abilities and Christian lacks confidence in so many areas. This relationship was so dysfunctal that it was hard to read so I definately don't want to watch it in big screen.<br /><br />There were some very exotic scenes in this book and Christian was a great teacher.<br /><br />NY
B004EPYZTE|1.0|If Hollwood would make a film staying true to Robert E. Howard's incredible source material they would have a GREAT movie. For some reason they make a movie based not on Conan, but every other crappy fantasy cliche they can think of. So they basically have a piece crap. I had to stop watching this movie several times due to lack of interest. Maybe someday a filmmaker will come along and make a film based on Howard's writing and stay true to it. We can only hope.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|...with the added bonus of Chris Squire making this CD lightyears beyond the sum of it's parts. Every track has Steve's fingerprint, and Chris's songwriting and bass (I wish it were a bit more up front in the mix) blends in to produce perfection. These days, so much music is available that you listen and move on. It's rare that I play a CD over and over and over and over. This is one. I wish it were longer.<br /><br />And \\"Aliens\\" is gorgeous, perfect, \\"Fish\\"-worthy Chris Squire, you dumbell.
1400063515|3.0|Referring to the 'Black Swan' has become a lazy thinkers habit, the book is excellent but, for example, 9/11 was not a 'Black Swan' it was the consequence of a number of agencies and individuals not 'joining up information' and creating data, data that would have prevented 9/11.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. I use to play it all the time,  on my Pc. now h'm glad it's an app. I can take it everywhere.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Nolan brings a whole new level to superhero movies. Before this, there were no superhero movies that can make such a dramatic story and action like this movie. This is a movie that every superhero movie lovers must watch.
B008J05EL8|1.0|No, I will not pay $5 (or anything, really) to have access to the same fonts I can get ahold of for free on my computer.
