B000059R8Y|5.0|EC is back! This CD is full of everything that makes Clapton such a unique talent. Two laid-back instrumentals bookend track after track of excellence. Rock, blues, soul, r&amp;B - it's all here and Clapton proves that he is the master!
B0000508U6|5.0|(Sorry I hate word plays too).<br />I am not going to patronize any of you by trying to discribe who Coldplay is, if you're on this site, chances are you know. What I will say is that you should buy this CD.<br />Like a lot of you, I was downloading these songs without buying them. I have since givin up the practice and bought the CD. Now, I was suprised when I realized that there were many songs I have not heard from this CD on MP3 or on the radio. When I realized I missed some of my now favorite songs I started buying entire CDs of other bands. (Third Eye Blind, Stroke 9). This particular CD is extremely good. If you like the songs you've heard on the radio (Yellow, Trouble) you will like every song on the CD.<br />Buy it and support the band so they'll make more CDs!
B000002IKR|5.0|I bought this tape back in 88' or 89' and I clearly remember not pressing the eject button on my stereo for at least a good month or so. These guys simply did something different than the other speed/thrash metal bands of that time. They were brutally fast but at the same time they managed to get a very polished sound which had me in awe. That was something that I feel that only one other band managed to accomplish during the second half of the 80's and that group was Metallica when they released Master of Puppets and ..And Justice for All. This album is definately one of those albums that you must have in your arsenal if you are into thrash/speed metal!!
B00003CX95|2.0|If I were an American, or anyone but a Brit I am sure I would love this film.  Its got nice scenary, epic proportions, fighting, and pretty people.<BR>However, I just cannot get over how insulting it is to the English (and scots).  <br />William Wallace was NOT a commoner!<BR>William Wallace was NOT fighting for 'scotlands' freedom.<BR>William Wallace invaded England, raped innocent women, brutally murdered innocent children, burned churches and spread terror.<BR>The list soes go on and on.<br />Now, like I say, this wouldnt bother me if I werent a Brit, in the same way that I enjoyed 'the last samurai' even though it paints an untrue picture, I am not Japanese, or a Samurai, so it doesnt bother me.  <BR>I take exception to people who say 'get over it, its just a film'.  Well perhaps the British should make a film called braveheart 2 where Osama Bin Laden plays the hero, the script would be almost identical, just change the names from Edward to Bush, and Wallace to Bin Laden.  <BR>Then again, Gibson abviously has som inferiority complex about the British, hence the patriot.
1592400876|4.0|Author Lynne Truss is not above vigilantism. Indeed, given her druthers, Truss would arm the citizenry--that portion of it, at least, that takes its punctuation very seriously--with permanent markers. Truss's plea for violent action in the face of mixed up itses may go unheeded, but her light-hearted, best-selling paean to punctuation, originally published in Great Britain (and retaining British punctuation practices), has clearly tapped into a vein of previously voiceless pedants who believe that the lives of punctuation marks are worth celebrating. Evidently, as Truss writes, \\"a lot of well-educated sensitive people really have been weeping friendlessly in caves for the past few years, praying for someone--anyone--to write a book about punctuation with a panda on the cover.\\"<br /><br />Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a breezy, funny account of the history, abuse, and proper use of a host of punctuation marks--the apostrophe (with which the author's affections clearly lie), the comma, the semi-colon (failure to use which was, according to George Bernard Shaw, \\"a symptom of mental defectiveness\\"), the exclamation point (among punctuation marks \\"the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly\\"), and so on. The book is a quick, amusing read, and it is besides an attractive little volume, panda-covered, of course: the perfect gift for the sticklers in your life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
1594200106|3.0|I've never been a fan of the \\"passion, obsession, tragedy\\" genre, where characters fall in love at first sight, can never love again after their beloved betrays them, spend their entire lives nursing violent hatreds, etc. So parts of this book definitely rubbed me the wrong way. And the writing is not great literature (though it clearly wants to be). But on the whole I thought it was an engrossing, enjoyable read. Just one fairly major quibble -- even with current medical technology, it is not possible to diagnose pregnancy WITHIN A WEEK of a single sexual encounter. Sorry. Uh-uh.  Major points taken off for making your entire book revolve around something that is biologically impossible.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Apparently Tarantino paid 728 people to say nice things about the complete garbage he called &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.  To think that intelligent people invested money in making this crap is astonishing to me. The worst use of film.
0399226907|4.0|Highly entertaining and vividly illustrated! A bedtime must! For other great 'buggy' stories, I highly recommend \\"The GigANTic Little Hero,\\" \\"HumbleBee,\\" and \\"The Non-Praying Mantis\\" by Matt Whitlock.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Stunning!  I find I get some of the same feeling that Clapton describes in the liner notes the &quot;music is my oldest friend, stuck in the back of my head&quot;.  He doesn't try to BE Robert Johnson but just remains faithful to the purity of the work.  If a complaint be found its in his obvious reverence of the body of work.  I can see the smoky roadhouse and smell the beer and ribs. If you like the blues and Clapton at guitar you've got to give it a listen.  My feet are tapping now!

B000009QPK|5.0|This is actually the first Slayer album I ever brought. I know that might sound strange and maybe even stupid but it's true. Maybe I should of started with something like Reign In Blood but I started with this and I have no regets. Many years ago, I would always look at Slayer albums when I would go to the mall but I would never buy them. Like I said in my review for Metallica's The Black Album, I was just a God believing, conservative youngster trying to be good and stay away from anything satanic. I just didn't have a good sense of true metal knowledge. I just kept seeing the video for Raining Blood/Black Magic on the old Juke Box Network and thinking it was killer. So one day, sometime in the spring of 1993, I went to Spec's to buy Dr Dre's The Chronic on cassette and I bought this release on cassette as well. It was all intensional. I didn't play this when I got home but I played it the next day. After that, I was hooked.    Now for my review. This is a double live album and from Slayer, it couldn't get any better. This is was done only a couple of short years before Divine Intervention. This was like 1990 but before Dave Lumbardo left the band. So this covers almost the entire history as it stood at that time. It goes from Seasons In The Ayss way back to Show No Mercy as well as stuff from all the albums in between except for Live Undead. So a lot of the hits and classic are here. There are some songs that I wish were on here but it's doesn't matter because Slayer rules. This albums captures the essense of what they are like live. It's just sheer intensity, fury, heaviness, brutality and onslaught coming directly from the throne of Hell. Some of my favorite songs here are Hell Awaits, War Ensemble, South Of Heaven, Seasons In The Abyss, Angel Of Death, Hallowed Point, Die By The Sword, Captor Of Sin, Born Of Fire and Chemical Warfare. Get this album and prepar for sheer onlaught. Slayer fans won't be dissapointed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Sure, nothing will beat the real original trilogy as we all know and love them. You'd think Lucas, being such a connoisseur of old films, would recognize a threat of tainting nostalgia, but his actions show that he doesn't think in terms of protecting nostalgia, but rather puts technology first, and updates his films as he sees fit. Lucas doesn't believe in the proverb \\"just because you can doesn't mean you should\\". Be that as it may, the Special Edition is refreshing, and I don't think it takes anything away from the overall feel that allowed everyone to fall in love with the movies in the first place (except maybe the ridiculously updated, all-CGI Max Rebo band in the special edition of ROTJ). Overall, I think it is a tad harsh to take what would be a 5-star rating down to a 1 simply because of a few new scenes.<br />I've been waiting to see the original trilogy in pristine format since... well, since 1982, when I first fell in love with the saga. As if the movies weren't enough to get excited about, the special features disc looks incredible, and will be chock full of goodies that not even the most die-hard Star Wars fans have seen. Head over to the official Star Wars site to check out all the special features.<br />By the way, those waiting for a non-Special Edition version of the Original Trilogy on DVD... just wait. George Lucas is probably the most business-oriented film director in the world, and knows exactly how to capitalize on every little teeny tiny detail that will bring him a profit... Rest assured there will be an UNTOUCHED Original Trilogy on DVD sometime in the near future. Over the next few years, I would expect no less than 2 or 3 big sets of Star Wars DVD releases... An untouched Original Trilogy set, a New Trilogy set, and a huge \\"sixology\\" set... not to mention the anime star wars on DVD, children's cartoon star wars on DVD, star wars the TV sitcom on DVD, and star wars the reality show on DVD.
B000001C6M|5.0|This is one of my favorite Slayer albums in my collection. I brought it sometime in the spring of 1995 along with Dark Angel's Decade Of Chaos (Best Of). These were times when my Slayer collection was very limited. I only had LIVE Decade Of Aggression and Seasons In The Abyss. I've already heard some of the Slayer classics beause I owned Decade Of Aggression but I just didn't have any of the classic albums. I really needed to buy them. So when I got around to buying this album, I brought it along with Dark Angel's Decade Of Choas (Best Of). When I got around to listening to this album, like what happens to me with every Slayer album, you are always reminded why the band has always been the very best in they do. Slayer will always rule.      Now for m review. This is Slayer's first album and it's a classic one indead. This is thrash metal the way is first began. What you'll find here is evil, satanic, heavy, brutal, intense, all-out, classic, memorable songs with killer riffs as well as evil lyrics. Every song has it's own identity but everything is to the direction of pure evil. Some of my favorite songs here are Evil Has No Boundaries, Die By The Sword, Fight 'Til Death, Metal Storm/Face The Slayer, Black Magic, Tormentor, The Final Command and Show No Mercy. Buy this album and prepare for a merciless beating.
0688163173|5.0|Having read all of Lehane's previous novels I looked forward to Shutter Island with anticipation, and I was not disappointed.<br />This is a very different sort of book than either the Patrick &amp; Angie mysteries or Mystic River. It is just as well-written though, and just as difficult to put down.<br />The story begins as a classic &quot;locked-door&quot; mystery--how did child-murderer Rachel Solando escape from her room in the hospital for the criminally insane on isolated Shutter Island? Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule arrive to try to answer that question just as a major hurricane is bearing down on the island.<br />The hurricane provides a suitably threatening and violent backdrop for the action. Nothing is as it seems. No one can be trusted. Threats to both mind and body lurk around every corner. Events take on an eerie, hallucinatory quality that is as disturbing as it is irresistable.<br />Yes, the ending is definitely a twist (or twisted?) but it isn't a cheat or a trick. Lehane earns every gasp of shock and shudder of horror. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time...at least until Lehane's next is released. ;o)
1592400876|5.0|This book is an interesting spin on things for those like myself who have a library of grammer books: MLA, Chicago Style, APA, etc.  It's a light hearted look at common errors without the stuffiness of most other style books.  A needed book for any editor, writer, or publisher.
B000063DFN|5.0|Though this album is no &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; (what Maiden CD is?), it comes close to it. This album is the best with their definitive lineup (Bruce, Adrian, Dave, Steve, and Nicko). Here is what I think of each song:<br />1. Aces High<br />Another BANG of an opening tune, which is something that Iron Maiden are very good at. Very fast, and some of Steve's best bass playing.<br />2. 2 Minutes To Midnight<br />Song kicks ass, need more be said?  Cool video too.<br />3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)<br />Probably Iron Maiden's second best instrumental, next to &quot;Transylvania&quot; (from the self-titled debut).<br />4. Flash Of The Blade<br />Probably the most underrated song on the album, but I like it. A true swordsman's anthem.<br />5. The Duellists<br />An action-packed tune of a massive sword fight.<br />6. Back In The Village<br />Probably the worst tune on the album, but not bad by any means.<br />7. Powerslave<br />Best Maiden title track next to &quot;Number Of The Beast.&quot;<br />8. Rime Of The Ancient Mariner<br />Probably the most extravagant Maiden closer, clocking in at a whopping 13:32 but not as good in such a way as &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (from the self-titled debut) or &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (from &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot;).<br />Overall, this is a great album and a must-have for a Maiden fan that does not own this.
B000009DUY|5.0|John Williams' score for Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's searing World War II drama about eight U.S. soldiers ordered to rescue a paratrooper whose three brothers lost their lives in combat, follows the simple-is-better-than-operatic format that made his music for 1993's Schindler's List powerful and effective.<br />Considering that most of Williams' film scores tend to be very bombastic and energetic (his Star Wars and Indiana Jones music tends to follow the Wagner/Korngold tradition of big orchestras and action-oriented cues), it's refreshing to hear this very prolific (and much-imitated) composer use orchestral restraint where he might have been tempted to utilize strident and Sousa-like marches, as is common in most war movies, especially movies about World War II.<br />But starting with the reverent-yet-mournful &quot;Hymn to the Fallen&quot; (a piece that is not heard till the End Credits, but is nevertheless an apt start to this album), Williams utilizes musical motifs to highlight the different aspects of the Normandy invasion as experienced by Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and the seven GIs who have been assigned to retrieve Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) from the small airhead held by the 101 Airborne Division on the Cotentin Peninsula in the days following the D-Day landings.  This beautiful yet haunting piece sets the proper tone for this album, and is reprised at the end.  (Careful listeners will note that this arrangement is not used in the film, however.  Williams and Spielberg use a longer version of this music that also incorporates the &quot;Omaha Beach Theme.&quot;)<br />Besides the &quot;Hymn to the Fallen&quot; (a piece which has become a staple of Memorial Day concerts since 1999) there is the equally solemn &quot;Revisiting Normandy,&quot; which serves as the film's &quot;Main Title&quot; and is heard as underscore to the scene in the Omaha Beach cemetery where the old WWII vet -- who will later be revealed as Damon's character's older self  -- is making his way to the beautifully maintained &quot;last resting place&quot; of several thousand Americans who gave their lives in France in 1944.  The trumpet solos by Tim Morrison and Thomas Rolfs, in addition to horn soloist Gus Sebring's performance, convey the mixture of gratitude and sadness most of us -- including director Spielberg and lead actor Hanks -- felt about the actions taken by the men who fought and suffered so much pain and death to liberate Europe from German occupation.<br />The one motif that dominates the film's score is heard for the first time in the now famous &quot;letters&quot; sequence, where Williams introduces the theme labeled &quot;Omaha Beach,&quot; starting from when Capt. Miller tells Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore) that he sees &quot;quite a view&quot; as he looks down on the invasion fleet and the debris of the initial landings earlier that morning of June 6.  It starts as a powerful yet mournful theme, and then segues to a more restrained theme-and-variations tone as the scene shifts first to the War Department in Washington, D.C. as we see the many secretaries and typists working on countless notification letters about fallen GIs.  It swells to a tragic crescendo when the Army sedan pulls up to the Ryan farmhouse in rural Iowa and Mrs. Ryan gets all three telegrams informing that three of her sons have given their lives in &quot;the altar of freedom.&quot;<br />Even in action cues such as track 9 (&quot;The Last Battle&quot;) Williams avoids the expected rah-rah type of overture that he is associated with for other Spielberg films.  Instead, there is a sense of suspense and impending loss to the music, reminding us that Saving Private Ryan is not meant to merely entertain us for thrills and chills, but to honor the men and women of the Greatest Generations, both the survivors who came home, and those who did not.<br />Williams conducts the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus with his usual goldentouch.  This is one of his most mature works and is a fitting musical tribute to the citizen soldiers who saved the world in its darkest days.touch.  This is one of his most mature works and is a fitting musical tribute to the citizen soldiers who saved the world in its darkest days.
B0001Z363W|3.0|Like Book of Shadows, this recording is a return to more acoustic and piano based tracks for BLS (which is Zakk Wylde and a drummer). Unlike Book of Shadows, Hangover has a more Beatles-like feeling to it rather than Shadows, which had a more southern rock vibe.<br />I'm dissappointed with the record.  The songwriting is simply not up to par for Mr. Wylde.  Obviously, this type of record is no place to showcase Zakk's incredible riff writing skill, but nothing as compelling is substituted in it's place.  It's as if the tracks were written in a hurry, while Book of Shadows was clearly a labor of love.<br />On top of that, there are some clumsy arrangements where scorching guitar appears out on nowhere, and is totally out of place.  A little slide guitar would have helped on plenty of the songs, and Zakk is a good slide player.  Also, Mr. Wylde doesn't adapt his gutsy hard rock voice to these mellower numbers, and it just doesn't fit a lot of the songs.<br />For anyone new to BLS, I recommend the excellent 1919 Eternal, Sonic Brew and Books of Shadows. Hangover, Stronger Than Death and Blessed Hellride - while entertaining records - are not amazingly great records like the three I listed.  But what do you expect when a guy puts out a record a year, they can't all be classics!
B000002NBY|5.0|as beautiful and complicated as a front side, this album still ranks among the best albums of all time. It's the perfect warm weather album, along with paul simon's rhythm of the saints.

B000002V0Q|5.0|This is another favorite Megadeth record of mine. I bought this on cassett along with So Far, So Good...So What! back in the summer of 1992 and every now and than, I would pop it in my sterio. It's still has the same appeal. With this album, things are a little bit different. The heaviness, brutally, intensity and assualt is still here but it's more in the direction of The Back Album by Metallica. There are a lot of catchy, groovy, slow and mid-paced songs, plenty of melody, solos and magic moments. Some fans of the older Megadeth stuff may not like this album or they might just give up on Medegeth after this one but I cetainly find nothing wrong with it. I love poping it in and it always keeps me entertained. Some of my favorite songs here are Skin O' My Teeth, Symphony Of Destruction, Forclosure Of A Dream, Sweating Bullets, This Was My Life, High Speed Dirt and Psychotron. But this or become extinct.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm a little apprehensive about writing a review for this album. I'm afraid that I won't be able to do it justice but I'll try. When I first listened to this album I was like alot of you maybe like. I pressed play and but didn't know what to expect. Through the entire duration of the album I was completely mesmerized by Paul Banks haunting voice and the intricate layers of the music. I never skiped a track and this remains one of the few Albums that I can do that with. The songs seem to cover you like a blanket and you can almost feel the music moving around you. Interpol combins the very best of the postpunk style and one can easly hear a 90's shoegazer influnce in their songs. I feel this band is going to be very important to influnce future bands and maybe revive American music from the baren waste land it has been sense the early 90's. Please just roll the dice and pick the album up. It may never leave your CD player.
B000002UDD|5.0|This is one of the first Megadeth albums I ever bought. I bought this with Countdown To Exinction and it ranks as one of my favorite Megadeth albums of all time along with Peace Sells. With this album, Megadeth goes to another level and Dave Mustaine and his band prove once again why they are a force to be reckoned with in the world of metal. What you will hear is some of the most killer, heaviest, assualting thrash metal ever done. The songs here are amazing, catchy and well executed. Just memeriable tunes that will never leave your metal psyche. Some of my favorite songs here are Into The Lungs Of Hell, Set The World Afire, Mary Jane, In My Darkest Hour and Hook In Mooth which is my favorite. Buy this and prepare to go up in smoke.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|The reissue of &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; is a cause for celebration.  The remastering sounds fresh.  Harrison's material on this set is consistently strong.  The title track is one of his best buoyant melodies.  &quot;If That's What It Takes&quot; is a strong song, one that has me hit the repeat button.  &quot;Just for Today&quot; is one of my favorite meditative songs; its sincerity as Harrison tries to live &quot;through this day only&quot; highlights his &quot;Be Here Now&quot; philosophy of living in the moment.  The bubbly background vocals on &quot;This Is Love&quot; and the retro guitar riff makes this one of Harrison's most addictive tracks, &quot;little things that will change you forever may appear from way out of the blue.&quot;  The lovely piano part with the classical melody makes &quot;We Was Fab&quot; one of Harrison's greatest Beatle legacy tracks.  &quot;Devil's Radio&quot; may be a bit overly didactic, but Harrison rocks so well that it's nevertheless quite fun as we join in singing &quot;gossip&quot;.  On &quot;Someplace Else&quot; the slower melody works marvelously as the gumdrop background choruses lull us into the sweetest of moods, &quot;I need you now to be beside me.&quot;  &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; rocks out joyfully with Harrison's marvelous lead guitar punctuating his unusual lyrics.  The lovely Asian-inflected melody of &quot;Breath of Heaven&quot; is charmingly romantic.  The closer for the original release, &quot;Got My Mind Set On You,&quot; is one of Harrison's most commercial rockers, &quot;It's going to take patience and time to do it right.&quot;  The bonus track &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; has some lovely Beatlesque harmonies.  &quot;Zig Zag&quot; seems a bit whimsical and perhaps a bit half-baked, but it's a lot of fun!  The sequencing of songs provides just the right mix of fast &amp; slow.  The art and photos in the booklet are exquisite.  This re-release of this classic set is not to be missed.  Bravo!
B000050XEI|1.0|Who in their right mind would call this cool?!!! I could probably fall asleep to this in two milliseconds. This music is for wimps. If you want REAL music (not this new age crap), listen to some heavy metal, like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Death, Obituary, and Pantera, or some genuine classic rock, like Aerosmith, AC/DC, Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Yardbirds, modern hard rock like Disturbed, Linkin Park, and Ill Nino. This music is for losers!
0553573403|3.0|The first chapter really grabs you and was good enough to make me read on, and on, and on until well into the third book to get to more of the same.<br />The author certainly has created a host of excellent and compelling characters.  Maybe too many to keep track of.  He really keeps the reader guessing who should I be rooting for? I kept finding myself dreading another sub-plot and another side character that I think ruins the pace of this series.  I think Mr. Martin needed a bit more discipline with the story to keep the readers level of interest.<br />Overall the series is great, but I could do without the rape and sadistic themes that keep coming up.  I think Martin wanted to keep these books dark, gritty, and cruel.<br />The chapters on Jon Snow, Arya, and Bran are some of the best I read in a &quot;fantasy&quot; book.  Maybe I should have skipped/skimmed the others.
6305451591|5.0|This movie was a awsome movie that i watched over and over. I like the way the father played that game with his son even tho if it was a real camp he probly wouldn't of gotin away with it.The movie did so some truth in it like the gass chamber and the work shops were they made weponds for the german army.over all i think u should see this movie because it will make u sad and happy at the same time. I give it 5 stars!!!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Just a quick note to the few who haven't seen this movie, and the fewer who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.<br />This movie is perfect in every aesthetic sense, the music (brilliant soundtrack, I own it), the cinematography, the world class talent (giving some of the best performances of thier lives)...still, I almost walked out because I felt Hollywood had crafted a perfect movie devoid of message, indulgent, I almost coulnd't stand it if that was the case.<br />Thankfully it wasn't, and is the reason for my review.  After a while the basic message of the film began to take shape for me and made a colossal difference.  So (without giving anything away), I believe this movie is about bravery.  Not the kind of &quot;I'll take the hill&quot; bravery we're used to, but everyday bravery, the kind that is too often found in short supply.  It's a story about a man who is almost a composite of what allot of men subconsciously strive for (not how he turns out, but the basic attributes of his life).  His world slowly and unnoticably degenerated into a life of misery.<br />And he did something about it.<br />He bravely decided to change.<br />He doesn't follow the textbook, and so a good deal of drama ensues, but he does his best.  I found it admirable, brave, and, well, no pun intended, but I found it really beautiful.<br />You're entitled to disagree with my interpretation, but when I shared it with a very intelligent friend of mine who didn't like the film, he instantly changed his opinion on it.<br />I hope you enjoy half as much as I did.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I wasn't real impressed with \\"Jackie Brown\\" so I approached this film thinking that Tarantion might well have already peaked with \\"Pulp Fiction\\"---boy was I wrong!  Just as Sergio Leone took westerns to a whole new and higher level, so Tarantino does to chop-socky martial arts flicks, plus a huge dose of 'TUDE.<br />The fight scenes are fast, furious and in your face; the dialogue is vintage Tarantino uber-cool; there's tons of self-parody and black absurdist humor throughout; the pacing is mostly seamless and quick; the camera work is flawless; the soundtrack as typical for a QT movie just rocks.  Sure there's lots of blood and guts but it's all very aesthetically well done, you really don't feel grossed out so much as fascinated and giddy.  The violence is cartoonish, and since Uma is the protagonist there isn't the usual obnoxious testosterone swagger we so often get in these action films.<br />Through it all Tarantino applies a beautifully subversive twist to the martial arts action genre: here, the women (especially one Uma Thurman) are not only foxy but fierce and fearless while the men are mostly just pussycats at their mercy.<br />Made me want to go see Volume 2 pronto!  I'd love to watch this film in a cinema in some traditional, pre-feminist, male-dominated patriarchal society like Japan or Egypt!
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is a gem.  Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.<br />Ok guys (the sub 3 star reviewers that take issue with the plot), so the plot isn't exactly groundbreaking &quot;Diamond is stolen by sophisticated group, stolen from the thiefs by unsophisticated group of thieves....&quot;.  It's not meant to be &quot;heavy&quot;, it's meant to be fun...<br />...and fun it is.  Every character could be a book unto themselves...hyper animated, colorful beyond belief.  The dialogue between them is world class.<br />Then there's the music...fantastic blend of Euro-contemporary and Old School Rock.<br />I highly recommend.
B0001US62I|4.0|Superlative performances by Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and Lisa Bonet in a downright dark story make this one creepy, albeit excellent movie. <br />The story line goes, Mickey Rourke's character is a PI hired to find a person who disappeared 14 years ago.  The story twists and turns and mixes in southern voodoo until it reaches a show-stopping climax.<br />A little slow at times, which can make the complex plot tough to follow, but everything comes together in the end.<br />Clearly one of the all time great underrated films.
6302378648|1.0|A bad Martin Scorcese movie if there ever was one, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; starts well enough but soon falls into predictable, convulted, contrived and annoying territory. A morality play about a psycho (played by Robert De Niro) who wants to get revenge over an attourney (Nick Nolte), this movie is derivative and tremendously by-the-numbers. Disappointing, really, given that the director and actors deserved better than a poor script with a very flawed execution. The final half hour on the boat is particularly bad and insulting, delivering an unconvincing resolution. Anyway, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; has one remarkable scene, where De Niro and Juliette Lewis have a weird moment of seduction. Unfortunately, most of the movie is just a tepid and unimaginative thriller like so many others. Bland characters, average direction, uneven pacing, pretentious dialogue and unsurprising/ over-the-top cliffhangers. <br />Avoid.
0440295734|5.0|This isn't the illegal scam plot of some of my other favorite Grisham books, but it is by far the most thrilling opening, and plays out into a meaningful, although somewhat predictable, story. I'd recommend this book, along with A Painted House, to those who maybe aren't big fans of Grishams typical books.
B00005JLWN|5.0|To me this film is an updated Farenheight 451. While this movie isn't better than The Matrix it is way better than Matrix Revolutions. If this film had more money and commercialization behind it it might have done just as well as The Matrix. Also, I don't agree with the R rating. The fight seens are awesome! The clerics have ninja like training with their handguns. I think the movie even has a good moral. After seeing this movie you'll agree it should have been rated PG13
0451196716|3.0|King is a master plot-spinner.  His pacing, with the possible exception of the last couple of chapters, is superb, and he's great at keeping the tension high.  This is not, however, a novel for the ages.  It's got engaging characters, several of whom you come to feel for, but they all too often speak with a kind of erudition that belies their years.  There's a kind of commentary on the human condition, here, and a critique of contemporary society's obsession with the public display of pain & humiliation (think \\"Fear Factor\\" & \\"Jerry Springer\\") that, in a 1979 novel, seems pretty prophetic.  But, when all is said and done, this is basically a beach book, and not the kind of work that repays the \\"only-novel-you'd-take-to-a-desert-isle\\" treatment.

0783240236|5.0|The Birds was a very good movie.  It took me a while to get into it but by the end I was very satisfied.  I thought it was very cool that it had no music in the movie because it was the only movie I have ever known that had no music in it.  Melaine (Tippi Hendren) was a very good actress, she did very well in this movie but I have never seen her in another movie but she was very good.  I also thought it was very cool that Alfred Hitchcock plays a very small roll in this movie just like in all of his other movies.  That is my favorite part about Alfred Hitchcock movies.  My favorite part in this movie was when Melaine gave the love birds to Mitch Brenners (Rod Taylor) little sister.

B000127LW2|5.0|Having been a fan of Star Trek since its beginning on September 22, 1966, I'm glad to see the long tradition of the Star Trek saga, from Gene Roddenberry's original concept, continue with &quot;Voyager&quot;!<br />Having never seen any episode of Voyager until the release of Voyager Season One on this DVD package, I am pleased to say I'm quite satisfied with Voyager and its concept of the two diverse crews being thrown together under the same problem of being stuck 70,000 light years from the Alpha Quadrant and home. <br />I have to agree with others that called Voyager's pilot episode (caretaker) one of the best ever for a Star Trek series. The original Star Trek series opened in 1966 with Episode #2 (Where No Man Has Gone Before) and didn't show the pilot until the middle of the second season, as a two-part show called &quot;The Cage&quot;. (unnoticed until years later was the mistake made in the original series opening episode where James T. Kirk's name was shown briefly as James R. Kirk on a headstone).<br />Being a person that grew up during America's first flights into space, during the 1960s, the original Star Trek was perfectly timed to exploit my vast and intense interest in space and space travel. With the introduction of STNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) I once again was in hog heaven as Science Fiction is something I enjoy very much. The Star Trek series of shows, rather that be the original, STNG, DS9, or Voyager offers more than just good Sc-Fi, but good Science Hope that we as a planet survive the next 3 or 4 hundred years.<br />I found that the first season of Star Trek: Voyager is as good as either Star Trek (the original series) or STNG. My initial impression is that I believe I will probably like Voyager more than I liked DS9 (Deep Space Nine). <br />Bottom-line, if you like Star Trek and you like good Science Fiction, then I'm sure you'll like Voyager. Having well written stories and excellent character interaction is a Star Trek trademark and the first season of Voyager has an abundance of both.
0790729652|5.0|Oh all the great memories of the early I have when I was watching the first and arguably the best entry in the Batman movie series! I just can't help but still love every moment of this movie and I still watch it countless times even after 15 years since first seeing it. This 1989 rendition of the legendary D.C. comic book character Batman is a complete universe away from let's say the 1967 movie starring Adam West which isn't too bad actually. With the help of Tim Burton and a really excellent plot, \\"Batman\\" is a candidate for the best Batman movie ever made. The other one is it's sequel \\"Batman Returns\\" which is just about as good but is a lot colder and more dramatic.<br /> The saga begins in the desolate dark dank streets of Gotham City. A massive crime wave has been sweeping across Gotham, putting the citizens' safety in jeopardy, straining the police forces and endangering the social stability of Gotham City. Bruce Wayne lives in a mansion outside of Gotham and was raised by Alfred Pennyworth after his parents were murdered when he was a child. Bruce Wayne has been traumatized by this since he witnessed their demise at the hands of vicious robbers. A crazed criminal mastermind named Jack Napier goes on a rampage and during a fight with Batman, Napier falls into a vast chemical tank which severely disfigures him. A while goes by and Napier returns demented and driven mad by the effects of the chemicals and goes by the name \\"The Joker\\" and becomes a vicious murderer and criminal mastermind. Now as Goth City is in danger from The Joker, Bruce Wayne dones on his \\"Dark Knight\\" outfit and fights crime all over Gotham City and now has to stop The Joker before he and his criminal organization enslave Gotham to his will. Meanwhile, a news reporter named Vicki Vale has been having a major crush on Batman unaware that it is actually Bruce Wayne.<br /> Tim Burton was the most perfect director for not only this movie but for the general Batman movie franchise. His movies showcase an unbelievably imaginary world with very eccentric, and even Gothic overtones and \\"Batman\\" was meant to be directed by Burton and it was and the final result is likely one of his greatest achievements of his entire career although a lot of his other films do offer competition in that title. Much of the cast too were made for this movie. Although the main hero character is played by Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson steals the spotlight as he plays the murderous The Joker. His personality and dangerous character are brought to life by Nicholson and that classic malicious smile was dead on perfect! Nicholson's portrayal as The Joker was phenomenal and the result is arguably the best batman villain of all time.<br /> I still to this day love this movie not only for it's action but also for it's combination of comedic humor in some areas but also how it blends some of those humor moments into the otherwise heavily dark and dramatic undertones of the movie. The music by Danny Elfman is amazing and the result is a really fantastic score. I also enjoy some of the classics by Prince who recorded a really great soundtrack for this movie. Tim Burton's directing is absolutely amazing and how he puts his strange and often eccentric Gothic undertone visuals is just mind-boggling. The sequel \\"Batman Returns\\" also benefits from the same styles of this movie. Looking back on it now, I find it hard to believe that this film franchise started out so powerful and riveting and just marched right down to the pits of ridicule with Joel Schumacher who ruined it with the fourth Batmam movie. The third one \\"Forever\\" was a lot of fun and had a lot of good moments but it lacked the maturity of the first two.<br /> The DVD edition however is highly deficient. While it's understandable that the DVD was released way back in 1997 when this format was brand new, seven years later, it has never gotten newer edition and this DVD is desperately asking for an updated format on almost all fronts.The audio quality is poor, and there are no extras that are worth merit and this is disappointing as this movie is really amazing. Another thing that could use some cleaning up is the picture quality. While generally good for what it is, The current edition is very deficient and almost worthless because there's so much in this movie that could use some tweaking.  if they can get themselves out of their collapsing chairs, then a \\"Special Edition\\" of this movie as well as \\"Batman Returns\\" and \\"Batman Forever\\" would do major wonders for these films. The fourth film \\"Batman and Robin\\" can be left to drift into the history books because even a \\"Special Edition\\" could not salvage that disaster. The \\"Batman Legacy\\" gift set is also disappointing because it just simply boxes the bare-bone old editions of the movies together with nothing new and this is unfortunate. They should look to what they did with \\"Aliens\\" and make a box set like the Quadrilogy.<br /> Until the time comes when the \\"Special Editons\\" of the batman movies come out, this movie as well as the next two are worth renting millions of times over and the first two are among the greatest comic book movies ever made even to this day.nts.

B0000542D2|5.0|The world was so stuffy back in 1964, plans for the movie included 30 matching suits for each of the Beatles: a total of 120 suits for the tailors to keep cleaned and pressed.  A scene in &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; in which a man in his underwear is hiding in the closet because Paul's grandfather borrowed his suit to go to an invitation-only private club casino helps capture the clothes consciousness that sets the fashion world spinning to an invisible beat which finds its back beat at the point where John Lennon can't help ceremoniously clipping a tailor's measuring tape with a sissors, quipping, &quot;I now declare this bridge open,&quot; in a rush of backstage activities that was scripted to match the hectic rush of entertainment mentalities in real life.  What it all comes down to is reflected upon best by George Martin, who said that when he told them, &quot;We need some more songs for the movie,&quot; the Beatles started writing songs that were greater than anyone had a right to expect.  For people who lived in the 1960s, this movie was like the invention of the human in a pop society that had been too far out to reach the big screen before, but which could dominate the minds of those who were in the right place to catch the fun it generated.  Watching the extras on the DVD ought to make you end up liking all the people who like this movie, which exudes that fondness in all directions.
0618526412|5.0|This book was first published in the 1940's, but still strikes a chord today. McCullers has an insight into human psychology that enables her to create powerful characters that almost everyone can relate to.  Highly recommended.
0679735259|1.0|I'm a Nam vet who read this book carefully just after publication.  I made a list of about ten downright silly errors appearing in the book.  Although I wasn't a Marine (Herr's on the predominantly jarhead scene), I was with the 1st Cav, the only US outfit that seemed to really impress Herr.  In any case, I was looking at an old Phil Caputo interview and Caputo says Herr told him he made up a lot of Dispatches.  That's something I can believe.  If you smoke less weed and have lots of actual combat experiences, you have a better quality of high punctilio recollections.  Lots of wannabees and political-types don't get that.  To actually have the background and boldness to question the veracity of a work like this is incomprehensible.  Well, I get to do that.  There is a bunch of fake malarkey in this book and honest people should not hold it in high esteem.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Yes, KILL BILL vol. I is gory and ultra-mega-violent. What did we expect, 103 Dalmations?? I for one, love this flick! Uma Thurman is beautiful, vengeful, and perfectly lethal as \\"The Bride\\", driven to track down and pay back those who made such a mess of her wedding day. The fight scenes between The Bride and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) are startling. When Copperhead's daughter comes home from school, we don't know what will happen next! The Bride's trip to Japan is of course, the odyssey that leads to the ultimate confrontation between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) in that soon-to-be-bloodsoaked Tokyo nightclub, The House Of Blue Leaves. Tarentino pulls out the stopper and lets the shredded limbs fly! I'm not a gore fan, yet the excess didn't bother me a bit. It simply added to the overall mood / atmosphere of the film. It's a very darkly humorous, intentionally over-the-top, samurai sword swinging, tribute to Bruce Lee and all things kung-Fu cheese!  I've heard others complain about Tarantino's movies, but nothing like the belly-aching campaign over KILL BILL! That was enough to get me to buy it right there. Watch it and make up your own mind...
B00004TH83|5.0|I may not understand any language other than English, but I have never found another cd in my 21 years of life, where I loved EVERY single song on the ENTIRE cd! That's almost impossible for anyone, but Lara, she is such a good singer, she sings with her heart, her emotion is so strong and pure that you just can't help but love every song she sings. I know the words by heart, I may not be able to sing to the songs that aren't in English, but I still know them. I thank a friend I used to have every day for telling me about Lara Fabian. Lara is the best, not to many singers can sing, write, speak and be fluent in so many different langauges, yet Lara can! You've GOT to listen to this cd, it's worth every penny, even if it were 100$, I'd buy it! I love it THAT much, it's the best. It IS my number 1 favorite of all time.

B0001Z363W|4.0|Let me retierate, THIS IS NOT A METAL ALBUM! <br />Hangover Music Volume Six is the second album release in as many years for Zakk Wylde and company. This album is indeed a complete 180 on what most people are expecting to hear. Every song contains a clever acoustic guitar riff or piano bar, or both. Every song contains intricate vocals (very little screams). Every song is new and different. AND, the guitar solos are still there (some are distorted, some aren't). This combination works fairly well.<br />HIGH POINTS OF THE ALBUM: (SONGS: Queen of Sorrow, Crazy or High, House of Doom, No Other), All of the guitar solos, the change of sound.<br />LOW POINTS: Production may seem a bit low-end at times (thick bass, thick drums, thin guitar).<br />TRACK LISTING (WITH TRACK TIMES)<BR>1. Crazy or High (3:34)<BR>2. Queen of Sorrow (4:15)<BR>3. Steppin' Stone (4:54)<BR>4. Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow (3:43)<BR>5. Takillya (Estyabon) (:39)<BR>6. Won't Find It Here (6:26)<BR>7. She Deserves a Free Ride (Val's Song) (4:19)<BR>8. House of Doom (3:46)<BR>9. Damage is Done (5:20)<BR>10. Layne (5:15)<BR>11. Woman Don't Cry (5:39)<BR>12. No Other (4:59)<BR>13. Whiter Shade of Pale (Procol Harum) (5:08)<BR>14. Once More (4:10)<BR>15. Fear (4:38)<br />All in all, this was a really good album. Most importantly, when judging it, most people should view this album on its own standards instead of comparing it to the last one. Personally, I prefer the heavy, distorted, screaming side of Mr. Wylde. But, doing something different every now and then never hurts anyone. I can only wait for the next BLS album, which should be hard, heavy, and mean! <br />Thanks for reading!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I see there are some people purposely posting one star reviews. Please,  you wouldn't know a great movie if it hit you over the head with a sword. This movie is awesome!  What QT did is he took pieces of old kung fu, spaghetti westerns movies and reshuffled it to make it his own unique style of film making. Clearly an original.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This film has proven to me that Quentin Tarantino's creativity cannot be stopped.  I'm looking forward to every film he comes out with.  I came to this conclusion after I saw &quot;Kill Bill: Volume Two&quot; last Friday.  I know &quot;Kill Bill: Volume One&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume Two&quot; are two different films, and I understand why he did it.  I wouldn't want to sit through a 4-hour movie, Quentin Tarantino or not.  However, I firmly believe that &quot;Kill Bill 1&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill 2&quot; are one movie.  The first one ended in a cliffhanger-like ending.  The second movie picked up where the first one left off.  I'm glad that Quentin Tarantino is getting the respect that he deserves from Hollywood.

B00005K3LW|3.0|DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE does not have the emotion and consistency of the first two movies. It doesn't happen on Christmas Eve like the other two. John Mclane's wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) isn't in it. Finally as in the first two films, the terrorism happens in the confines of one specific area (i.e.  Die Hard: in a high rise building, Die Hard II: at an airport).  This adventure is all over the map in New York City. However, it is one of those movies that grows better with repeated viewings, somehow works better on the small screen, and also helped by the chemistry of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Jeremy Irons is decent as the villian and overall an above average action thriller.
0671027387|2.0|Dan Brown, unfortunately, seems to be a one-trick pony.  This book, which predates &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; by about a year, follows pretty much the same ark.  Two &quot;heroes&quot; (actually 3, but one is pretty much a throwaway) discover a secret, and are pursued by killers (Delta Force, instead of the Albino Priest), who are guided by the secret manipulator (The Controller, vs. The Teacher) who is a surprise when we find out who it is.  Both stories take place in one continous swath over a day or two.<br />Deception point also suffers from a generally preposterous plot.  Brown invents far too many technologies, and doesn't do enough research on known technologies (do I really want to believe that a Los Angeles class submarine has enough space for an anechoic chamber in the middle?)<br />Sorry, but I don't think I'll be picking up more works by Mr. Brown.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|The reviews for this movie about the injection of a Left Coast  &quot;Bohemian&quot; Art instructor (Roberts) into the 1953-1954 school term of staid Wellesley College for Women generally fall along gender lines. But this is not just a period piece of chick flick fluff about stereotypical men who prefer Stepford Wives and Marilyn Monroe mistresses,  and divine debutantes who  need only worry their pretty little heads about &quot;marrying well&quot; and picking out the correct china pattern.<br />The excellent cast and extra features on this recommended  DVD  show the underbelly - unrestrained by an advertisement for the &quot;freedom&quot; of a rigid girdle (!) - of the pseudo perfect &amp; placid 50's. The viewer gets the feeling, though, that  just like the era itself, major currents and events have been editted out.  Mona Lisa's mysterious smile, indeed.<br />&quot;You've Come A Long Way, Baby.&quot; Virginia Slims Cigarettes, advertisements, 1960's and 70's<br />but<br />&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot; George Santayana 1863-1952
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha is a pretty light story on the surface- 140 or so pages of very descriptive prose. But I imagine that it could be dissected and analyzed in a far greater depth than most would.<br />Its a feel good story that covers a lot of the thoughts most of us have had about why we are really here and what we should be looking to achieve. There is no golden answer at the end, just like in life. But it succeeds in making you re-address issues you may not have thought about in a while- and does so with a really charming storyline.<br />Hesse's writing style is very descriptive- he is especially excellent at detailing physical environments and bringing out the beauty of landscapes. I haven't seen the movie, but I can understand why most Amazon reviewers have trashed it. Hesse does such a good job of presenting Siddhartha's world in this short book that any external interpretation might be seen as blasphemy.<br />You should get this book. Its cheap, short and likely to be something you'll re-read every few years. And you leave it with a smile on your face :)
B00005R24K|5.0|I love this movie. It is so creepy and gory that it's amazing. The story is simple, but the camera work, acting, and special effects make this one to watch again and again and again. The features are also superb(of course they are, this is an Anchor Bay DVD).
B0000C7PRY|1.0|You'll hardly believe this stuff was written and performed by the author of 'The Light' and 'The Door'. The quality of the recording is astonishingly poor (sounds like the early 80's); lyrics sound like they've been written by a second rate TV preacher, like the ones you see in American movies, or those street preachers that shout at you 'Jesus saves!' while you're crossing Piccadilly Circus. The all-American idea itself of labelling rock as 'Christian' or 'non-Christian' is quite amusing. Rock music is either good or bad - this record is rock music at its worst, provided we can define it rock. No imagination, no poetry, not the least effort of composing universal lyrics. Only 'Jesus saves!' shouted or whispered at you one hundred times. Hopefully Mr Morse's mystic crisis is over soon, with Jesus back into churches and Morse back into rock'n'roll. Until then you're warned: don't waste your money on this CD! Buy a bottle of good wine instead, and enjoy it with a good friend.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I just liked it the first time I heard it!  The volume was high, but I felt peacefuly sleep, and I slept with the soft sound of the melodies.  I don't see much difference with &quot;Surfacing&quot;, neither in the music nor in the CD composition.  It's very well balanced, with the everlasting Sarah's orchestra that fills every little silence with good enough strenght, backing vocals that give adequate support to Sarah's voice as in &quot;Stupid&quot;, softness that relieves anybody's mind.  Best songs?  In this order (up until now):  Time, Stupid, Answer, Dirty Little Secret.  If you are a loyal fan, dont hesitate to buy it.  If you are a new listener of Sarah's or just curious, its a great opportunity to discover one of the greatest female singers and composers of our time.

B000002H97|5.0|Yes this is the album that hardcore Metallica fans say they sold out, because all of the commercials and it just wasn't the old hardcore thrash old Metallica sounds from albums like &quot;Master of puppets&quot;. But I still think this is the best Metallica album out of them all. Songs out of this album like &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Sad but true&quot; are awesome hardcore heavy metal songs. I guess it was probably the song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; with the violins that fit the mood that brought heavy metal fans down. They didn't get what they wanted. But I love the song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;. It is an awesome song, not heavy metal, but still great. <br />The way they commercialized their first sing &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, which is a great song but no one liked the way they commercialized it. But to me it is still an amazing song. The first song I ever heard from Metallica was \\"Enter Sandman, and when I did, my music taste changed forever. I love this band very much, and the band deserved its spot on #2 on the 22 greatest bands list special they had on MTV, because Nirvana did deserve #1, and I like Nirvana better than Metallica. But either way Metallica is still an amazing hardcore band, which brought a new noise to the generation of music. And plus this album was ranked #4 on the 22 greatest albums of all time. So it evens out, sort of. <br />But after listening to the album I don't think Metallica sold out. I just think they took the next level, as Kirk Hammet would say. But he is right though, they just needed a new sound, which they perfected very well. Metallica just moved from the 80's to the 90's. Like in 1995 especially people called them sellouts because that's the year they cut their hair. There was no more long hair, and as heavy metal fans would say no more old school Metallica. This is a great cd if you want to listen to heavy metal songs from the 90's. Including the soft center song, if your in the mood for it, \\"NothingElse Matters\\". Which that song I love. A must get.
B0000AM6JI|4.0|and make sure it wasn't 1975 and I was late for high school.  DePalma's got the mood and atmosphere so exact I was certain I could still get Chrysler stock at $3.00 a share.  CARLITOS WAY is another Pacino character development exercise that probably would be better remembered had it not come on the heels of his Oscar winning work in SCENT OF A WOMAN.  What is unforgettable is Penelope Ann Miller's stage/pole dance sequence (I can't listen to Cheryl Lynn's &quot;Got To Be Real&quot; the same way again).  A lot of familiar faces from other Pacino work and the usual great half dozen quotable lines.  Sean Penn deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination...the high perm alone should have nailed it for him.

I know now any teenager would look at this movie and be like what this this but i have seen it and i enjoyed it. You thave to thgink that to the time and it was a great movie at the time. In its time it scared people out of their mind but now you wathc it its like you are watching a comedy. The players in the movie were great they fit the parts perfectly, Melanie Daniels was played by tippi hedren a rich girl that falls for a man Mitch Brenner who was played by Rod Taylor, she fallows him to a small town to bring him a couple of birds he ordered.

0783225792|5.0|CASINO made me pine for the glory days of 70's Las Vegas:  The sleazy attractiveness, no traffic jams on the strip, the high rollers.  CASINO is what's expected of Scorsese, DeNiro and Pesci: riveting story telling, hypnotic visuals and their trademrak retelling of history that can make you disregard the real truth (although here their version is precise).  The unexpected standout performance of Sharon Stone (Best Actress nominee...the film itself was robbed at Oscar time) as (DeNiro's) doomed wife is a jackpot in itself.  The soundtrack featuring the Scorsese standards (Jerry Vale, The Rolling Stones, Don Cornell) is perfectly meshed into the storyline blending the two as one.  Along with HEAT, CASINO marked the best of American film in 1995.
B0000028WD|4.0|I'd give this 5 stars, but there are a bunch of tracks that force me to hit the \\"skip\\" button on my CD player.  The rest is good enough to boost the rating back up to 4 stars.<br />Perhaps the best thing about this grouping of performances is the fact that everyone has a different favorite part.  After reading all the other reviews, I'm left amazed that nobody has pointed to the Eddie Veder/Mike McReady rendition of \\"Masters of War\\" as the highlight of the set.  To me, this is hands-down the reason to own this set.  The amount of feeling poured into the words and the preformance is astounding and a true credit to the genius of Bob Dylan.  It provides a case in point that any and all Dylan songs can be made into the performer's own heart-felt masterpiece.  Sure the performances by Neil Young, Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, etc. are outstanding, but one likes to think that would go without saying by now.  If after listening to this you can't feel the anger, emotion and scathing attack behind the lyrics to a song like \\"Masters of War,\\" you simply never will.  The lyrics ring just as true today as they did the day they were written --- if not for knowing better, one might think this song was written for George W. Bush and Dick Chaney. Only the Vedder version delivers the anger and emotion that are conveyed in the words themselves...this is what a protest song is meant to be!

B0001E7LQG|3.0|I thought this movie was OK.. not good, not great, and I was suprised Ebert gave it 3.5/4 (I think there's some money being shuffled under the table with that guy?). I found the film to be mildly entertaining and it managed to keep my attention for its 2hr+ length, so that automatically gets it 3 stars. Oh yeah, and it got a couple chuckles out of me as well. Otherwise, I felt the story was very poorly written and full of painfully obvious flaws. First of all, Frances McDormand's character made a captivating debut early in the movie but was completely left in the dust. It's like after the first 30min Nancy Meyers forgot about the character and by the time she remembered, the story was too far along to even try to write her back in. Then there's Keanu, who's role is very flat and quite boring to be honest. His part is weak and, in the second half of the film, seems to be used exclusively as a tool to try and 'fix' the movie. Take for example the ending. I believe Meyers originally wrote the script having Jack go to paris, find Diane there alone, and they live happy dappy. Realizing this was too boring she decided to throw Keanu back in to add another twist to the plot. Great idea! Now all she has to do is rewrite the whole ending with Keanu, but instead she just kind of pushes everything around and shoves him in. Like when Jack sits down with Diane in the restaurant and later -suprise- Keanu walks up. Diane says something like,\\"Oh! I should  have told you he was here, but I was so interested in your story!\\" Poor patching job there. Then on the bridge during the final scene. Jack asks, \\"Where's Julian?\\" Diane replies something like, \\"Oh, he saw that I was still in love with you and we broke up at the hotel.\\" Please! Nancy Meyers really fumbled the ending. Then there was the whole deal where Diane was writing the play as it was happening to her, which was really supposed to be Nancy Meyers, and the play is called 'A Woman To Love' and it's all supposed to be the clichemovie about a movie kind of thing. But that doesn't work out either for some reason. It was obvious that the movie was intended to be titled 'A Woman To Love', like the play, but instead it's 'Something's Gotta Give'. WHY? Where did that title come from?? The number of flaws in this movie are many. I felt Jack only took his role seriously half of the time and Diane became quite annoying, especially after the prolonged supposed-to-be-funny(?) 'crying like a baby' scene. But all in all, I thought the acting was good (minus Keanu, of course), especially Keaton. Didn't want to be too hard on the movie, it wasn't bad, just that the errors in a film have never jumped out at me quite like they did in this one.
630469654X|5.0|This is a great film about a young couple cursed by a jealous and very powerful man the Bishop of Aquila played by the underrated John Wood.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer is Isabeau a hawk by day and Rutger Hauer Captain Navarre is a wolf by night.<br />They can never be together except for one brief moment at dawn unless the curse can be broken.<br />Enter Leo Mckern as the drunken priest Father Imperious who needs to atone for his past sins, and a boy Phillipe Gaston, the Mouse, acted to perfection by a young Mathew Broderick in one of his earlier roles.<br />The plot is simple and exciting; Navarre wants revenge on the Bishop for the curse he has laid upon him and his one true love, but the only way to get to the Bishop is by attacking his fortress and that is a suicide mission.<br />Enter the Mouse who is the only person to get out of the Dungeon's of Aquila alive and it is through the Mouse that Navarre can extract his revenge.<br />There is a lot of action, good acting overall, a lot of humour, and some wonderfully touching scenes that don't get over cheesy which is saying something.<br />Look out for Alfred Molina as the Wolf Hunter Cezar, it's one of his earlier roles.<br />All in all this is a film that time has not touched, it is as good to watch in 2004 as it was when it was made in 1985, not bad for a film that is nearly 20 years old!
0060930187|4.0|THE BELL JAR is a book I wouldn't normally have picked up had I not read the narrative history of McLean Hospital, the asylum for those of Boston's upper crust gone balmy, GRACEFULLY INSANE by Alex Beam.<br />Sylvia Plath's novel, an autobiographical account of her descent into madness with names changed to protect the innocent, begins in the same tone - though not with the same charm - as Susan Allen Toth's IVY DAYS, the latter's memoirs of her college days at Smith College during the last half of the 1950s . (Interestingly, it was Smith that Plath attended a couple of years previous.) Specifically, Sylvia's alter ego, Esther Greenwood, is one of twelve college girls who've won a fashion magazine contest, the prize being a month-long, expense-paid, freebie-filled, glamorous job in New York City as the guest editor of a national magazine. When the month is up, Esther returns home where, under pressure to make something of her life during her senior year of college, she cracks. From that point on, the storyline progresses from half-hearted attempts at suicide to one that almost succeeds, then subsequent admission into a country-club asylum for psychotherapy and electroshock treatment. (Though THE BELL JAR never states, even in the chapter &quot;Sylvia Plath: A Biographical Note&quot;, the author's real life experience was at McLean Hospital.) It's while on her way to the private mental institution that Esther defines &quot;bell jar&quot;:<br />&quot;I would be sitting under the ... glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.&quot;<br />THE BELL JAR is a hypnotic look at the mental deterioration of a talented and intelligent young woman. It's like watching the slow-mo replay of a person's self-destructive plunge off a building's ledge. There's perhaps an argument here for the book being required reading by the parents of any teenage girl.<br />The literary world benefited when Sylvia Plath regained relative mental equilibrium long enough to write THE BELL JAR before succumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963. Her ultimate fate renders even more poignant and prophetic her words:<br />&quot;How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;uccumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963. Her ultimate fate renders even more poignant and prophetic her words:<br />&quot;How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Those of us who have read the entire series of Patrick O'Brien's books on the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his dear friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin during the Napoleonic wars and have soaked up the atmosphere and sense of history so unfailingly captured in those books, are going to be hard to satisfy with any film representation. So although I have great respect for Peter Weir, I did not have high hopes as I sat down to watch the movie.<br />The opening scenes, of a darkened sea and a silent three-masted 'Surprise', with only night watch on deck and most hands asleep below, gives as true a sense of period as any I could possibly imagine - and captivated me immediately. The attention to detail is remarkable and the handling of the crew; surely one of the most difficult aspects of making such a film; utterly masterful. You can smell the lower deck with the hammocks tight-packed with sleeping, farting, snorting bodies and livestock penned into the same quarters. The battle scenes are stunningly effective and the impact of shot and ball makes you wince in a manner that you'd not think possible in an age where we constantly see violent action and are inured to the sight of exploding flesh. That you could not follow who was who in the melees - or determine quite how the various battles between ships were unfolding - didn't matter, because that is exactly how such actions are in reality. Who knows how many died by friendly fire in the confusion of those hand-to-hand encounters? The percentage must have been sizable, as it is even today.<br />Russel Crowe's performance as the utterly resolute and masterful sailor, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, is truly brilliant. His English accent falters little and he gives the role all the subtlety required of a character whose own subtlety is not immediately evident. Aubrey is a commander who is intensely sensitive to the mood of his crew - knows all their names - and treats them with a rare humanity for the early 19th century Royal Navy. We know he acquired this sense, in part, because as a young midshipman, he was once demoted to the rank of common sailor; and in this experience, came to understand them as few officers could.<br />The disappointment, for me, was in the lack of development of Dr. Maturin's character. In the books, Maturin (played here by Paul Bettany) is in a sense the main character and much of what happens is seen through his eyes. He is an immensely complex man, deeply learned, and with a quaint 18th century manner of speech which contains much Irish mannerism. \\"You are to consider\\" he will say, or \\"I am persuaded that ...\\". His turn-out for formal dining occasions is the subject of much affectionate amusement among the crew (for they take pride in him as 'their' learned physician, who cares deeply for his patients) - and vexation for his Commander; for he may appear at dinner in a heavily blood-stained jacket, unwashed for several days, or with his wig awry. He is also evidently a man whose apparent age \\"might have been anything between twenty and sixty\\" and he is small and \\"ill-looking\\". He and Jack are total opposites and it is the interplay between the two characters; the great affection they hold for one another, that is the spirit of the books. So I say that I was disappointed that Stephen was not better cast and his character was not more defined. I can however also say that those scenes where the two of them make music together do succeed, by the nature of the music chosen, in coming close to the spirit of the book. I should also emphasize that we cannot blame Paul Bettany for this; the problem lies in the casting and in character development (Paul Bettany looks too young and well-kempt for the part and is given little chance to 'be' Stephen).<br />So on the visual level this is a brilliant film and Crowe is most convincing in his role. Weir has performed a labour of love and has soaked himself in the period and the genre.<br />People who read the books, and say that theycannot get past the vast amount of technical detail, will find no relief in the film. O'Brien was uncompromising in his use of nautical terminology and indeed of period language - readers have to take the responsibility to inform themselves in order to appreciate the book and now, to some degree, viewers of this film have the same responsibility.
B00005RZV4|5.0|There's the good rock albums and the great ones. Then there's the forgettable cash-in live rock albums and there is the absolute &quot;must listen&quot; and &quot;must have&quot; ones which come very, very rarely.<BR>    This here definetely belongs to that latter category.<br />    I have a collection spanning 3 decades and several 1000s of LPs but this is only the 4th live i decided to own. Owning a live CD means in my book that it has captured a vibe that usually only having been there can give you. One other example is Portishead's live album which is an equal stunner.<br />   Nine Inch Nails are not only known for the way they pioneered industrial music along with a handful other groups (most notably Ministry) but because all of their studio albums are a tribute to emotional edginess and intensity. It would really be a miracle or a massive failure (depending on how you see it) had this asset of NIN not come through on this live album.<BR>   But thankfully it does and does so in almost chilling manner.<br />   No need to attempt and describe what you're in for by listening to this album. That would be futile. Rarely have feelings been transfered musically in such an overwhleming manner.<BR>    A classic live album from one of the greatest bands ever.
B00004BZ16|4.0|Sandinista is so much more than the sum of it's parts. I won't even try to classify it because to do so would be impossible. The Magnificent Four tackle every imaginable genre and then some on what was originally a 3 record set - a subversive act in and of itself. What on earth were they thinking? Did they have any idea how appropriately this album would convey the spirit of 1980 (or anticipate what was ahead musically)? This album is Rock and Roll in every sense of the term; raw, loud, spontaneous, fun, serious, dark, hopeful, untidy and relevant.<br /><br />One recommendation though - find a decent vinyl copy and listen to all six sides of the actual record - loudly.
B000001DYA|5.0|I don't acutally own this disc, but Sabbath released Black Sabbath in 1968 - the same year I believe as Blue Cheer's first release.  Blue Cheer is heavy, no doubt, and loud, but they lack the riffs that made Sabbath the prototype/original/founding Heavy Metal band.  This is not a dig at Blue Cheer, but let's give credit were credit is due!!!
0385336810|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Sophie Kinsella's books.  I loved the entire Shopaholic series.  I had high hopes for this new book and it was better than expected.  I laughed out loud and couldn't put the book down.<br />Emma Corrigan is the character in this novel and she has a few secrets from her boyfriend, her family, and her friends.  Don't we all?  On a plane ride home from a disastrous business meeting they hit turbulance and she thinks she's going to die.  She spills all her secrets to the man next to her on the plane.  This man turns out to be the very sexy owner of the company she works for...Emma later finds out.  The story goes from there and is so funny, heart wrenching, and honest.<br />We all have secrets...even little things like weight and hair color...that we don't want to get out.  Emma is totally easy to relate to and Kinsella has a way of making you really feel the character.  I wanted to be there to help Emma out or give her a hug.  I definitely recommend this book.
B000002L7Y|4.0|A-ha might be a victim of the success they had on MTV.   This group has so much more to offer than the overplayed hit &quot;Take On Me&quot;.   A-ha's debut album is a complete effort and are by no means a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; as they branded by VH1.   I do believe the vocals are what set a-ha and in particular this album from the others and it is lead vocalist Morten Harket that shines and makes this an album woth having in your collection.   Another thing to note - Pål Waaktaar is one heck of a songwriter.     This group was so mis-categorized as a teen act.   Perhaps that is why they never found the commerical success in the U.S. following this effort.<br />&quot;Take on Me&quot; might be your classic 80s song, but there are other songs that have a lot of depth on this CD.   The songs that follow &quot;Take On Me&quot; are even better.   The second song &quot;Train of Thought&quot; has a definite European feel.   It is a nice catchy song with and Harket leads the way..   &quot;Hunting and High and Low&quot; is the title song and is definitely one that is as enjoyable as any.<br />The 2 best songs on the album are &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; and &quot;Here I Stand and Face the Rain&quot;. &quot;Sun&quot; got a lot of airplay in the U.S. following &quot;Take On Me&quot;, but surprisingly didn't crack in the Top 10.   The song was arranged beautifully as well as outstanding vocals.  &quot;Here I Stand and Face the Rain&quot; starts out with some simple  almost 'spanish-like' guitar chords and then moves into some intense instrumentation, followed by more great Harket vocals.  I believe you here some background vocals going &quot;aaaaaahaaaaaa&quot; in it.<br />I bought this CD back in 1985.  It was pretty thin in terms of lyrics and liner notes.  I don't know if any re-releases have changed this.

B000002UA0|5.0|Without question my favorite albums are those done by artists whose sole intent is to create a reflection of what they feel and believe at that particular time. The titles that really stand the test are those which can still convey an artist's vision vividly and artistically decades (or more) later.<br />The world, both socially and politically, was a very different place in the late sixties whether kids were still buying Monkees albums or just turning on to Hendrix. Generally most people's mindset was much more naive than today and there was a place for experimental music that came from the artist rather than his marketing analyst or demographics sales coordinator. Music of that sort, no matter what the genre, is genuine and usually somewhat insightful even if it isn't particularly entertaining, which this album is.<br />No... it doesn't sound like DSOTM or The Wall but that isn't surprising. I mean really, who would expect the Beatles first album to sound like Abbey Road? If Lennon, McCartney and the lads put out SGT PEPPERS in 1963 they'd probably have been shunned and locked up as dangerous lunatics. Artists, just like real people, grow and evolve... then they die. But the art lives on and I'm really glad Syd Barrett and the boys put this gem together because it captures what the musical underground was really about back then BETTER than any other album I've listened to.<br />If everything you hear has to sound like variations of the same album you should be sure to pick up every live/studio/bootleg/allstar knockoff and tribute to The Wall that there is. But if you're actually interested in where all this came from (and not so jaded that every flavor has to taste the same) then treat yourself to a real gem and pick up PATGOD.

B00004TDTO|5.0|Why Jaws is a study in perfect storytelling:<br />1. It's paced to perfection.<BR>(You can't take your eyes off it for the duration)<BR>2. It makes you care about the characters and their predicaments.<BR>(an art almost abandoned in filmaking these days)<BR>3. It's a thriller first & a monster movie second.<BR>(If they can scare you with a big rubber shark then it has to be)<BR>4. It has countless memorable moments<BR>(pick your own favourite)<BR>5. Half the dialogue is quotable / memorable<BR>(ditto)<BR>6. It set the bar for all subsequent blockbuster films (it was the first after all), few of which have even come close to matching it for entertainment value.<BR>7. It has a beginning, a middle and an end.<BR>(Beginning  - Is there a Shark out there or not? , Middle - The Shark's coming to get you!/Let's get the Shark , End - Confrontation with Shark & Resolution)<BR>8. The roles are well conceived and have character depth, and the acting is first rate.<BR>9. It is believable as a story.<br />Many people point out just how bad the sequels were. Let's face it, the concept of a sequel to Jaws is a non-starter anyway. However, I would like to recommend that you see the third Jaws sequel, entitled Jaws the Revenge. Why? Because it is a perfect example of what happens when you remove / do the opposite of all the the above points in making a film. It is remarkable it that it manages to do this, and just has to be seen if purely as a comparison to Jaws.<br />To explain, Jaws the Revenge is:<br />1. Paced to ensure that you lose interest within the first five minutes.<BR>(You can't stop taking your eyes off it)<BR>2. Not only do you NOT care for the characters, but by the end of the film, you're actively rooting for the bloody shark!!)<BR>3. It's not a thriller or a monster movie. It appears to think it's a geriatric romance addressing family dysfunction, peppered with scenes involving rubber sharks doing acrobatics and leaning on boats.<BR>4. It has no memorable moments apart from the end when the Shark expolodes for no apparent reason (really!)<BR>5. The dialogue is banal and largely irrelevant to the plot(!?)<BR>6. It set the bar for awful awful films<BR>7. It has a beginning and then just meanders until its time to finish the film with the worst ending of any film you will ever see.<BR>(Beginning  - There's a Rubber shark out there! , Middle - A series of unconnected and boring events to pad out the 87 minutes running time  , End - Confrontation between Rubber Shark and crap actress ends in hilarity!<BR>8. The roles are conceived in the pub on the back of a fag packet and are all badly acted except that of Ellen Brody, which is overacted.<BR>9. It's insulting to the intelligence as a story, is illogical and has the largest plot holes of any film i've ever seen.<br />Comparing the two should be done, as it makes you appreciate Jaws as a fine film, and also shows you the depths to which Hollywood sunk in it's wake.

He has his eye's on a very special lady who's husband is a nazi, in which the movie is taken place in Italy in the 1930's at the beginning of the holocost. Gweedo,(Bengini) is jewish and lives with his uncle who is a locally known jew. Some nazi's come and raise hell and graffiti on his shop. so after a few years he falls in love and marrys her. They have a child joshua who is loved dearly by them. When the nazi's come to take them to concentration camps, the mother isnt jewish but goes anyway to support them. Gweedo tells his son that its a big game. The winner will win a tank, so joshua is really hoping to win the tank and they just need 1000 points to win it. Over all a very sad but funny movie.

It's lyrics prove that Sammy Hagar is a better writer than David Lee Roth ever was, as you can actually take inspiration from the song &quot;The Dream Is Over&quot;, which in itself explains why I prioritized keeping in shape over going back to my old school's Thanksgiving dinner. &quot;Right Now&quot; is a socially-conscious midtempo piece that warns us that if you make a stupid mistake, everyone, including yourself, will pay the price with their health and looks.  Even on FAIR WARNING, David Lee Roth never managed anything as trenchant as these two songs. Get this one, 5150, OU812, 1984, the debut, and FAIR WARNING first, then buy the other albums, but don't clutter up your living space with DIVER DOWN, BALANCE, or III.

B00000K3G8|4.0|4.5 stars.  I finally coaxed myself into watching the DVD concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; and was subsequently blown away by this band's energy and enthusiasm.  If anyone is just now getting interested in this groundbreaking band I sincerely suggest watching the DVD first, then purchasing this solid live disc in a state of euphoria.  While I gave the DVD 5 stars something is lost when only listening to the music.  The production here is stellar, and many of the songs take on an added life that the studio versions lacked.  Like &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; which is explosive compared to the studio version, and &quot;Girlfriend is Better&quot; is a juggernaut by comparison.  But without all the fancy camera-work and fantastic visuals from the film some of the songs come across a little limp.  Like &quot;Burning Down the House,&quot; which is great in the film, the band's enthusiasm oozing through the screen, but just listening to the recording made me long for the hyper-produced studio hit.  But the minor flat spots are more than made up for with the addition of &quot;What a Day That Was&quot; which is magnificent, and the souped-up version of &quot;This Must Be the Place(Naive Melody).&quot;  There are layers of instruments with two synthesizers, two lead guitars, a percussionist as well as a drummer, and it all adds to the vitality of the performance.  I listen to this CD more often than any other of their albums, &quot;Remain in Light&quot; coming in a close second.  But this has 16 songs, many of which are the best songs in their impressive catalog.  This is perhaps the best starting place for the beginning collector, but I seriously suggest seeing the film version for a full appreciation of the effort put into this performance.  It is great fun!  Not to mention, there are extras on the DVD, including two other songs cut from the final version of the film.  Take it easy.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I hope nobody wastes their time watching this movie.  It is nearly as bad &quot;Dreamcatcher.&quot;  If you are a fan of movies that have a sense of honesty without being sappy or predictably cheesy, do not watch this movie.  You will sit and wish for a respite from your agony.
B00006AG5N|3.0|This is the first Elvis CD that I had ever listened to. My Dad has a copy of this CD and it's really how I got hocked on Elvis. My entire family likes Elvis really. Even my younger sister just recently got interested in him this past year.<BR>The reason for three stars, is because I have found much better, and brooder Elvis CD collections.<BR> I very highly recommend From Nashville To Memphis: The Essential 60's Masters [BOX SET] and Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential 70's Masters [BOX SET]. The sets are pricey at best. However, you get a lot more hours to listen to Elvis. The on a one CD set.
B0000683DH|4.0|I can remember being slightly disappointed when the first Star Trek movie came out in the theatre, thinking it lacked the television series' \\"the Enterprise takes a hit and everyone goes flying around the bridge, everything's blowing up and Mr. Scott has ten seconds to fix it or else...\\"<BR>Well, I wasn't disappointed with Star Trek II.  It recalls the best of the original TV series: lots of action, an interesting story, the classic character interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy.  The claustrophobic feel of the movie works well within the story framework as the crew of the Enterprise are being hunted by their long ago nemesis, Khan Noonian Singh.  Star Trek II does right by its villian, Khan.  He's the bad guy, a genetically engineered superman from the 20th Century, but he's a well rounded character unlike the cardboard cutouts of evil that we are treated to in so many lesser movies.  And he's an able villian, his starship can shoot straight (except in the nebula when neither ship has particularly good aim), and good people need to make the ultimate sacrifice to ensure he is defeated in the end.  <BR>I think the reason this movie, out of all the Star Trek movies, works because it not only celebrates the TV past of the Star Trek show, but adds to the canon.  Things happen in this movie, characters change, characters besides \\"Ensign Smith\\" die.  Good TV results in the same characters and the same situations week after week.  Good movies result in characters developing over the course of the movie.  This is a good movie.<BR>Now, to what's not so good.  For the most part, the special effects are quite good, especially when you take into consideration this movie came out in 1982.  However, the underground Genesis world just looks bad.  It looked bad in 1982 and it still looks bad.  Considering how much the first Star Trek movie was redone for the DVD release, you'd think Nick Meyer might have got some extra money to clean those shots up, maybe with a nice realisticlooking cavern.  Oh well.  The Directors' Cut isn't all that much different from the theatrical version: just an addition here and there to add maybe two minutes total of dialogue.<BR>The extras aren't all that impressive.  Almost all of it is interviews and snippets made for the DVD release.  I think William Shatner is trying to be funny with the whole \\"Spock dying conspiracy to get more money\\", but I would have rather heard real information about the movie.  And didn't anyone bother to shoot any documentary footage when the movie was being made?  No offense, but I am more interested in extras that provide insight to the movie, either physically (show the effects being made, the scenes being directed, etc.) or critically (talk about the drafts and revisions of the story, etc.).<BR>I recommend the DVD as it is nice and clean, the sound is tremendous.  Watch the extras once and forget them, but come back to watch the movie again and again.(...)
B0001NBM1C|5.0|Fortunately I was able to watch this twice and I was much more impressed the second time.  Crowe is really a magnificent study in leadership,a brilliant strategist, often understated, but assertive when and only when he has to be (\\"men have to be governed\\")or when every so often he has to reaffirm his responsibilities to his good friend Dr. Stephen Maturin, who is much more interested in the fauna of the Galapagos Islands than in the capture of the French warship.  His crewmembers seem to respect him totally, never moreso that when he gives a rousing fight speech prior to the main battle, which is a ruse perpetrated on the French. Aubrey also has a fine sense of humor,shown in his wry comments on Lord Nelson and in his now-famous pun,and he is also musical, along with Dr. Maturin. Aubrey is also diplomatic: when Maturin is taken ashore to remove a bullet from an abdominal wound, Aubrey walks alongside the cot.  When Maturin says to Aubrey, \\"I hope you're not doing this just for me\\" Aubrey replies, \\"No, I'm just stretching my legs.\\"  The film is filled with brilliant sets from the preindustrial seafaring age and I am quite sure I could pick out many more details in a 3rd viewing.  Their food looks terrible, generally speaking; I enjoyed the small snatches of sea balladry sung by the crew.  There are several notable vignettes, for example the officer who commits suicide because (unlike Aubrey) he is mocked by the men and cannot live up to his leadership role; the crewmember who is cut off during the gale (Aubrey notes \\"he was well liked by the men, do you hear any repercussions?\\");the old man who recovers from brain surgery; and the numerous surgical episodes and biological vignettes throughout, involving Dr. Maturin.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|By far the best Christina album ever. This Christmas album really dose justice to the vocal talent that are Christina possesses. If you doubt Christians talent please buy this album you'll soon be a believer. I listen to this album not just around Christmas but all year i love this CD .Stand out songs include OH HOLY NIGHT, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS,  AND CHRISTMAS TIME
B00004BZ16|5.0|You have to listen to the laments that the Clash wail on this record. The problems of man are addressed here and contemplated to the beat of what was, at the time, an amalgom of styles. What I think many reviewers are missing is that the song is the story is the message is the album. There was a lot to be said and this band took it upon themselves to say it. Read the lyrics and let them sit a while and you will realize that the music is only background. <BR>If the music on a record were the only relevent feature of an artist, you would never hear artists like Woodie Guthrie, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Johnny Cash, and others...<BR>The reason this record is important is that this group of musicians decided that it really didn't matter what style accompanied the message. They were doing what they wanted to do, and that is what the spirit of punk is, in my mind anyway. Not to suggest that George Bush is the ultimate punk, mind you. He's an ass. The Clash loved playing music, and we are fortunate that CBS funded such profound creativity. <BR>Say what you will, but I think Outkast could not have made such a record if the Clash had not gone so far out on a limb so long ago. If you are too impatient to listen to the story, you should not buy this record
B00005JM02|2.0|Although I've seen and enjoyed every Pixar film so far I have to say  Nemo dissapointed me. This is certainly a sad story, a lonely story about loss which I don't find appropiate for kids. I don't remember anyone dying in any of the previous PIXAR movies and they were still great movies, so why putting the idea of death and loss in the children's mind? Children should laugh and enjoy and we adults should try to let them enjoy thier chilhood and protect them from sadness. There'll be plenty of time for that when they grow up. Visually the movie is great and some of the special features are worth watching too but the storyline is far from being funny. Grab yourself any of the TOY STORIES instead.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|The arrangements are fantastic and the band flat out cooks! The songs are a bit of a memory lane journey (which is not a bad thing). These young guys know what the music is about, and play these great standards with fresh new vitality. Buble is obviously enjoying himself and this is quite clear in the DVD, which is the real treat in this package. There is a crafted balance of dialogue and documentary woven around the songs. On some tracks I wish they would just let the song continue without interuption, but understand the &quot;promo&quot; side of things. The bonus tracks from the AOL Sessions are very cool. The musicians again stand out as a group of amazing artists, all with really fine improvisational skills. The AOL Session truely displays a talented group of young jazz cats. This CD/DVD package is a well produced collection of classic standards. Buble is a fine singer, and a great entertainer!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|While the special effects are stunning, the movie itself was a huge letdown.  This is after going in with low expectations to begin with.
B0000041TD|5.0|I love this recording so much, of course Karajan is one iof the best conductors of all times, PAvarotti sings with probably the most beautiful and sweet voice; Mirella freni is a great tender Mimi, and when I hear the third act I always end up crying!!The rest of the cast is great too, this is one of my favourite opera recordings, although I think that the recording of La Boheme with Di Stefano, Callas, and Moffo is very good too!!!
B0001ENYKS|5.0|I love this cd.  God bless these Scotts!  Ever been in a slump and feel like you need something new to listen to?  Something that you can dance to?  Something to put a smile on your face?  Well, this is it.  The first song starts off pretty slowly, but refers to my birthname...gotta love it, but it builds and then kicks ass. &quot;Gregor was down again, said come on kick me again.  Said, i'm so drunk i don't mind if you kill me.&quot;  &quot;Jacqueline&quot; surely does rock.  Then there's &quot;Take Me Out&quot;.  It starts off, &quot;So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you.  I'm just a crosshair.  Just a shot away from you.&quot;  It's just foot stomping, feel good music for a groove depraived fan. And, this isn't even to speak of &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; and &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot;.  Then there's &quot;Michael&quot;.  You hear...&quot;Michael, you're the boy with the llleather hips.  Sticky hair, sticky lips.  Stubble on my sticky hips.&quot;  Some boy on boy action for a change!  Right on!  There's so much more.  You won't be disappointed.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Its been on repeat for the past two days and it is simply stunning. Is it possible that it is better than Book Of Shadows?? Never thought I would ever think that.  <br />From Crazy or High to Whiter Shade of Pale (wow) and let us not forgot the eloquent Layne (RIP Mr Staley) the power and emotion shines through on every track, the songwriting and lyrics are superb. <BR>Simply put it is an epic journey of sincerity. <br />Strength - Determination - Merciless - Forever

B000094J5T|3.0|\\"The Pianist\\" follows the misadventures of Wlad Szpilman, a piano-playing Polish Jew who must endure the horrors of Holocaust.  Already an adult by the beginning of the war, he suffers the growing indignities heaped upon the Jews - from Jim Crow style segregation to internment in the notorious Warsaw Ghetto.  As a concert pianist, Szpilman enjoyed the friendship of non-jewish Poles before the war.  Once the war began, he managed to hold onto enough of them to successfully escape the ghetto and elude the Nazis or Nazi-backed Poles.  The final half of the flick has Szpilman moving from one safe-house to another as the enemy goes from containing the jews, to crushing the Warsaw uprising, to crushing other resistance forces.  The story moves slowly as the horrors of war and its deprivations slowly erode Szpilman's life.<br />I wanted to like this flick, especially given its apparent devotion to the hero's POV.  The production values are incredible, and some of the sequences are just fantastic (especially the scene which touched off the ghetto uprising).  So why isn't this a classic flick?  Let's blame the player.  Though Brody gives a good performance, he's hamstrung by the emptiness of his role - once he escapes, Szpilman is reduced to living on the generosity and pluck of others.  I don't want to get into the whole \\"should he have fled or fought\\" debate, but Szpilman doesn't really do anything other than lay low.  This restricts the directions the story can take to two - document only what Szpilman sees, which would tell a good story but essentially nullify him as a main character; or, keep the focus on Szpilman himself - marooning the story on a guy who - deprivations aside - remains isolated from the horrors occurring around him.  \\"The Pianist\\" opts for the 2nd approach, quickly morphing into a Holocaust film which has little to do with the Holocaust.  Arguably, Anne Frank was also holed up in a temporary asylum - why should her story be treated differently merely because she was a more sympathetic character? (She was a kid, and everybody knows that her story was NOT one of survival.)  The difference between the two is that, Anne Frank's story redeems humanity in an inhumane time - the interaction between Anne and her fellow refugees framing a debate about whether all people are good, and that finally being captured by the Nazis ironically liberates her from a dehumanizing experience surviving in ceaseless terror.  The opposite is so in \\"Pianist\\" - depriving Szpilman of much interaction to reveal his feelings (his Polish saviors are sympathetic strangers - connected to him by mutual acquaintances; we learn very little about them or how they made the superhuman decision to stand up to both Nazis and similarly minded Poles).  Excellent production only highlights the sense that \\"The Pianist\\" is telling the wrong story - never letting you forget the possibility that a more deserving story was unfolding across the street, down the block or over the wall from Szpilman's safe-house.  The script makes a further mistake in that it loses Szpilman's character completely - who he is and why we should care if he survives when others don't.  The error is compounded when the script hints at an ulterior motive for the generosity of at least some of Szpilman's Polish saviors (who found that many Warsaw Jews were willing to part with some of their won possessions to pay for Szpilman's safety).  The film surprisingly redeems itself near its end when Szpilman receives help from an ironic direction.  A Wehrmacht (German Army) officer discovers Szpilman, but protects him - not only feeding the refugee but giving him his first crack at the ivories in years.  We're supposed to be cheered that the survival of the artist bodes well for the hero's humanity.  It's a moment the film crafts and then destroys.  By the end of the film, Szpilman has survived, looking more polished than you'd expect for the horrors he had endured.  Tuxedoed, and at the centerof a concerto, he bears no scars of the horrors he's seen, nothing to indicate the enormity of the miracle of his survival.
B000094DUP|4.0|To a previous reviewer, Delta has Hodgkins disease, a type cancer arising from the lymph nodes and has undergone chemotherapy. Delta also had 3 or 4 number one hits in Australia before news of her illness became public. Your comments tell us alot about the type of person you are and your ignorances.  Great Debut album from the young Australian, and I look forward to listening to more of her music in the future.
0385015364|5.0|Before his series of Father Brown mysteries, G.K. Chesterton wrote &quot;Orthodoxy,&quot; an autobiographical 'detective' story of how he came to believe the Christian faith.  Drawing from &quot;the truth of some stray legend or from the falsehood of some dominant philosophy...an anarchist club or a Babylonian temple what I might have found in the nearest parish church,&quot; Mr. Chesterton playfully and inductively reasons his way toward the one worldview that best explains and preserves the phenomena in the world he found around himself.<br />The world around Mr. Chesterton was rife with Modernism in the early twentieth century.  Based on philosophies of the late nineteenth century, religious and political traditions were being questioned.  Anarchism, communism, and socialism were the parlor topics of the day; the merely symbolic importance of religion was being settled upon.  These are the roots of our post-modern society today in which the meaning of nearly everything (even words, according to literary deconstructionists) is now in doubt.  At one point in the chapter entitled &quot;The Suicide of Thought,&quot; Mr. Chesterton quips, &quot;We are on the road to producing a race of men too mentally modest to believe in the multiplication table.&quot;  An exaggeration even today, undoubtedly.  Still, we have traveled quite a distance philosophically since the era before the World Wars, and &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is an excellent snapshot of where we've come from.<br />But be warned:  This snapshot captures a lot of active thought.  It took me a couple of reads over as many years to get a handle on the structure of the book, and now the rest of it has been becoming clearer to me.  Part of the problem is Mr. Chesterton's writing style.  There is much playfulness in his language, and a reader could mistakenly conclude that the author's reasoning relies heavily upon wordplay, the turn of a phrase to turn the tables on his opponents.  It can become frustrating if one isn't careful.  Mr. Chesterton himself acknowledges this impression, &quot;Mere light sophistry is the thing that I happen to despise the most of all things, and it is perhaps a wholesome fact that this is the thing of which I am generally accused.&quot;  But don't miss the meat for the gravy (or the salad for the dressing, as your case may be).  The potency of his arguments doesn't rely on his clever semantics but on his connections between observed facts and the ancient, corresponding orthodoxy of Christianity.  Mr. Chesterton has fun with words because he can, not because he needs to.<br />This mixture of cleverness and careful thinking ultimately leads Mr. Chesterton to this conclusion:  Christian faith is well-reasoned trust in Christ.  And the desire for well-reasoned trust is a &quot;practical romance,&quot; as Mr. Chesterton calls it--a need in the ordinary person for &quot;the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure...an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome.&quot;  A way to accept the knowable while looking beyond it toward what is yet to be known.<br />Mr. Chesterton wrote &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; for people looking for that kind of romance.  &quot;If anyone is entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or the phrases in an omnibus, the accidents of politics or the pains of youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain conviction of Christian orthodoxy, he may possibly read this book.&quot;  However, this book isn't for everyone.  &quot;If a man says that extinction is better than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure, then he is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking.  If a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing.&quot;  The inconvincible cannot be convinced.  Yet the skeptical (such as Mr. Chesterton once was) can be because they are the doubters who're still looking around.  I myself come from a skeptic's background and regard &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; as a plausible,if sometimes difficult to comprehend, and wonderful way someone can come to trust the claims of Christianity.ible, if sometimes difficult to comprehend, and wonderful way someone can come to trust the claims of Christianity.
B000089RVX|5.0|Hey if you're into Gothic rock with a christian message, there's a band called Evanescence. They have a CD titled &quot;Fallen&quot;. Their song &quot;My Immortal&quot; which is quite popular, is my personal favorite of the CD. The beauty, emotion, and strength of Amy Lee's (Evanescence's lead vocalist) voice is so overpowering that it brought me to tears the first time I heard it, it made me feel as if my troubles and problems were so much smaller. Also Evanescence sends a good Christian message in most of their songs, especially in their song &quot;Tourniquet&quot;. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is about someone who has attempted suicide and is asking for God's forgiveness. The first verse of the song starts out &quot;I tried to kill my pain, but only brought more.&quot; which is true because if you're depressed and in pain, suicide will only bring you more pain, and sorrow. Now the chorus of the song is &quot;My God, my tourniquet return to me salvation&quot; where she asks for her salvation to be returned, because she realizes that she has made a mistake. I've found this CD to be quite helpful during hard times. So it's an all around it's a great CD, and I give it 5 Stars!<br />- Teenage Chrstian and Musician
0385512104|5.0|Christopher Boone is a 15 year, 2 months and 3 days old boy who lives in Swindon together with his father. One night he finds the dog of the neighbour with a garden fork sticking out of it. He decides to solve this murder in the way his great example Sherlock homes would have done, because animals have the same rights as humans. Christopher really needs to stretch his limits while &quot;detecting&quot;: he is autistic and cannot cope with simple things like the colour yellow, being touched, being in a place with lots of people or eating food of the wrong colour. But he uses his very rational mind (he wants to become a mathematician or, ideally, an astronaut) to make choices between options and to overcome some of his fears. And he ultimately discovers a truth far bigger than he could have imagined when he started his adventure.<br />This is a bitterly funny book looking at the world through the eyes of somebody who has problems understanding emotions and other human behaviour and language that are taken for granted by non-autistic people. Mark Haddon really described the essence of what it is like to be autistic. A great read (and I loved the little drawings). 
B00000I8UK|5.0|One of the most remarkable things about this release is that it is molded from the avant-garde spirit, but the music is still accessible to the masses.  Each song is so rich in texture, and can stand alone. As one of the previous reviewers said, it's truly a desert-island disc.
B00000DRVZ|5.0|No Aerosmith collection would be complete without this CD.  The guys are fresh and the band is tight.
B00008RH1H|3.0|Throne of Blood is an Akira Kurosawa's rendition of Shakespeare's Macbeth.  The story pretty much is the same with a few minor character changes, one sprit instead of three witches for example, and some obviously included contextual changes, set in pre-modern Samurai Japan.  I understand that it has historical relevance and all, but really the movie itself is nothing too special.  It is just an ok movie.    Now that I have said that, I feel I need to warn the viewers out there who do not usually watch foreign films.  These people must be wary of, if it bothers them, the fact that the film in black and white.  I understand that some people cannot sit through black and white films.  There is also lack of ongoing action, typical Shakespeare, that we are used to, and that puts some people to sleep, so be warned about that too.  I feel that you should watch it for your own cultural and mental advancement, but unless you like the genres of Japanese/Samurai films or Shakespeare adaptations then you probably will not like it.  In addition, it is in Japanese, so if you do not like subtitles then you should be warned once again.  I recommend you watch it, but at the same time I feel that once is enough.
B000089CJI|5.0|...but anyway, on a more serious note. This album is full of beautiful, catchy songs and wondrous melodies. Buy this album, was mich betrifft, it's one of the best of 2003. And if you haven't already, go out and get Transatlanticism by Death Cab while you're at it.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|J , it's The Green Hornet Theme and it's on the volume 1 soundtrack.<br />As for this soundtrack, I love it!!  I can't stop listening to it.  My favorites are Goodnight Moon, About Her and Urami Bushi.
B00005JMSE|3.0|I didn't have much background about Hellboy going into the movie. All I knew of it was from the trailers that I had seen and the cool action figures you can buy at the toy stores. However, the action looked quite good and I am always willing to give these types of movies a go. However, after watching the movie, the best part of the 2 hours I spent at the theatre was the Spider-man 2 preview. I found that the movie was quite simplistic and left me feeling unsatisfied. The storyline was too simple. And the climatic battle was short and too easy. The character relationships were too shallow. We didn't see much of the relationship between Hellboy and his father although it is implied that there is a strong bond. We didn't see much interaction between the two characters. The relationship between Hellboy and Liz was an odd one. We know that Hellboy loves her but we don't get a real sense of how she feels towards him or any of their history together. The relationship between hellboy and his new companion is also under-developed. We weren't told why that guy was chosen by Hellboy's father, only that he was \\"handpicked\\". And he didn't do anything to affirm that he was special in any way, other than try to move in on Hellboy's girl (***GIGGLING***). There were also aspects of the movie that were unexplained. For instance, how did the cross raise the russian corpse from the dead. What exactly was that giant creature in the end. In summary, I found this movie to be mildly entertaining, but nothing that will be long lasting in my memory. Go see it if you like superheroes or action, but don't expect too much.
B000002UB3|5.0|I love this album so much.  I remember my parents had a vinyl copy of it while growing up and I loved to listen to &quot;Hear Comes the Sun&quot; as a young child.  Then as I became a teen and a young adult I continued to listen to this album over and over.  I find something new musically here with each and every listen.  I especially love the exteneded song cycle on the second side.  And the song &quot;The End&quot; is such a powerful statement about Rock n Roll, the Beatles, philosophy about life in general - that words cannot describe how magical and universal this album is.  If you listen to it once or twice and do not understand this album, just keep listening - eventually it will make sense and truly get under your skin.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface&quot; has grown into the realm of cult status since it's original release, it is one of those films which was not a blockbuster smash upon release, instead it's value and importance was determined with the passage of time. This is the case with many great films, while &quot;Titanic&quot; isn't talked about as much as when it first came out and broke records, &quot;Scarface&quot; is always a popular favorite and is always cited as an influence on the popular culture. The story is the criminal angle of the American dream: Tony Montana (Al Pacino) arrives on Miami's shores with the large wave of Cuban immigrants who arrived in the early 80's, soon he makes contact in the world of the cocaine trade and rises in it's ranks, ending-up taking over his boss' organization (and mistress played by Michelle Pfeiffer), but the world of lavish excess is also the instrument of his downfall. &quot;Scarface&quot; remains a stylish, vibrant movie, it is one of those few crime pictures where the set design and story work side by side. The screenplay is by Oliver Stone, who himself was living in the world of cocaine-snorting in Hollywood and wrote the script as a goodbye to the vice, is fascinating in it's exploration of the criminal underworld and at the same time tells a highly entertaining, well-crafted story of a man's desire to find success and his downfall brought by the excesses of that success. Director Brian DePalma films the movie with energy and craft, with vibrant colors and a pacing that makes the movie long, but not slow. Al Pacino delivers one of his great performances, he is always on the edge, intense and incredibly convincing. Some have accused the performance of being over-the top, but that's where these characters live. The movie was also first attacked for it's violence, and today some still consider it pretty heavy, but the violence the movie portrays is real. Anyone who watches the news or keeps themselves informed knows the violence in this movie is aneveryday reality in the world of the drug trade. In the years since the movie first premiered, &quot;Scarface&quot; has proven to be highly influential, the new DVD edition features a fascinating documentary on the movie's influence on the hip-hop culture who apparently uses this movie as base for ethics and style. For movie buffs it's a great story that's well-made and expertly performed and written, just look at the great ending! &quot;Scarface&quot; is a bonafide American classic.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This movie is a labour of love for the Director, as he said himself in the commentary that come together with DVD version.  There are times when we watch movies that are based upon true events and yet, the context of them are warped beyond recognition.  For this instance, the Director opts to remain faithful to Hillebrand, the lady who lived &amp; breathed the subject, Seabiscuit for most of her adult life.  It's probably a David versus Goliath movie, of a talented thoroughbred that was overlooked &amp; was mistreated.  The jockey in the form of Macguire's character, Red was leading a parellel life.  Somehow or rather, their lives intertwined with Howard (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), the owner of Seabiscuit who was forever looking towards the future.  Ironically, it's the future that tragically took away his beloved son's life.  Anyhow, as Red narrated in the movie, people in the Depression believed that Seabiscuit healed them and that it drown their sorrow somehow.  However, he thought that people healed themselves when they started to believe in their own abilities.  Definitely a triumph of the human spirit movie.  A DVD to be treasured with extras such as the original racing footage versus the movie footage, the making of the movies, the commentary by the Director.  By the way, this movie is a definite all rounder.  Superb performances by all cast.  A must-see movie of the year.  If this movie proclaimed to make President Bush cried, it must have done something right.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Every now and again a film comes along that is described as a gem. This is because the film just like a gem is a surprising pleasure to find esecially amongst the mass expanse and typical rubble of moviedom. <br />The Usual Suspects...<BR>is just such a gem!<br />The film is described as a classic by all who have seen it even though it was released as recently as 1995. The title of the film itself is said to be borrowed from the much earlier classic, Casablanca.<br />When the film was released, it contained a host of 'unknowns'. However, do not associate the word 'unknowns' with 'untalented'; as is proved by the star of the film, Kevin Spacey, who picked up an Oscar for his mesmerising performance as Verbal Kint. <br />I confess that I will not try and give you a detailed synopsis of the film as I do not want to spoil your viewing (or perhaps more appropriately I would not know where to start my synopsis!)<br />Quick Synopsis:<BR>Five Criminals Are Brought Together In A Police Line-Up...<br />If you are going to see the film for the first time, you will notice that when you ask for the film at your local video store, a smile will mould itself onto the owner's face. Why?<BR>Because he knows just as everyone else who has seen the film that you are letting yourself in for something special.<br />And, I guarantee you that the next time you go into your local video store and catch a glimpse of the now 'oh-so-famous' cover of the film out of the corner of your eye you will notice that whereas before the film camouflaged itself against all the other films, it now seems to shine just like a self-assured individual stands out from a crowd.<br />If you are going to see the film for the second/third/whatever time. I hope you enjoy the film again and have fun trying to answer the immortal question:<BR>WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?

0790729725|5.0|Of all of the &quot;mob&quot; movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the &quot;definitive&quot; mobster movies. Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling &quot;based on a true story&quot; nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.<br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a powerful film based on the true life best seller &quot;Wiseguy&quot; by Nicholas Pileggi. More specifically, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liota), who along with his pals Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film. Needless to say, the performances by these actors, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are nothing short of superb.<br />The premise:<br />Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them. After all, how could anybody resist a life in which if you're part of the &quot;organization,&quot; there is nothing that you cannot have and you have the fearful respect of everybody around you, as long as you're continuing to make money and not stepping on any of the important people's toes.<br />As the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.<br />From the opening frame to the final credits, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily. I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies. Fair warning though, this movie &quot;is not&quot; for the faint of heart or the squeamish, for it is fairly graphic at times, which serves to enhance the nature of this film but is not too good on the eyes. {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />This DVD was released in 1997 as one of the early transfers, therefore it's not loaded down with an exceptional amount of special features, which is fine because it's all about the film. I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re-released as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.<br />What is does have:<br />- A remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1<BR>- Production notes<BR>- Two theatrical trailers
B00009TB5G|5.0|This version a whopping 223 minutes long  and  is one too discuss.  With hours of  features.  Better  than the theathrical.  New footage.  A longer begin  an a  later introduction to Golloum.<br />It has some good new scence including   a flash near the end of the movie  with  Bromir and and his brother Feramer.   A good  dvd  four comentary for the whole movies  110  minutes long each.<br />More action than the other  and some fun hillarious scenes.  Some new dialogue has also been added to some of the scenes. Frodo is great and so is Samwise.  Better than the extend version of the Fellowship.  <br />If you like this see the Extend version of the Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the  king when it becomes avilable.
0783225792|5.0|Filled with all of Scorsese's trademarks and marks the 8th pairing of Scorsese and DeNiro. The most prolific actor-director team since John Ford and John Wayne. But unfortunately 'Casino' is one of their lesser efforts. Among it's shortcoming is it's epic length, it's just a little too ambitious. Scorsese tries to cover a lot of ground with little plot structure and flimsy supporting characters. The first third of the film plays life a fascinating inside documentary on the Las Vegas moneymaking machine. It starts out well enough, fast paced and with long camera sequences that reminded me of 'Goodfellas'. That is one of the film's other big problems, almost all of the characters seem recycled from 'Goodfellas' at least Pesci and DeNiro are the same. Their verbal riffs are equally intense and memorable but unfortunately we've seen this done more than once in better films, AKA 'Raging Bull' and 'Goodfellas'. Sharon Stone on the other hand delivers a mesmerizing performance as a beautiful call girl that catches DeNiro's eye and then marries him. This is when the film bogs down a bit, all that subplot about Stone's addiction and her relationship with a manipulative pimp is really bothersome. James Woods creates a very unsympathetic character, one of the most unlikable characters ever to grace the screen, and that's not a good thing. He's a weasely, sleazy and manipulative pimp who has some kind of hold over Stone's character that is never really explained. But still, Sharon Stone's performance was astonishing and got her a much-deserved Oscar Nomination, her first and only nomination. Pesci basically repeats the performance that won him and Oscar in 1990 with 'Goodfellas', he's the same hot-headed trigger-happy menace. DeNiro does his best but unfortunately his character has little to work with. Also appearing in supporting roles are Don Rickles (!) and Kevin Pollack. Filled with all of Scorsese's trademarks; an excellent 60's soundtrack, excellent use of slow-motion andvoice-over, instantaneous mad bursts of violence and impressive use of cinematography and editing. Some violent scenes are a bit too graphic and definitely not for the squeamish. For example, the scenes where Pesci is torturing an Irish thug and almost squishes his head, and the unforgettably gruesome death of Pesci and his brother when they are both almost beaten to death with bats and then buried alive. Not a bad movie, in fact it remains a very good one, but one can't help but expect more from Scorsese who has proven himself to be one of the best and most original filmmakers in the last quarter of a century. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7! --This text refers to the VHS Tape edition
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein are the kings, it's as simple as that. No other metal band can match them. Their live shows are breathtaking and their music is none other then superb, - even though they sing in their native tongue. Mutter is Rammstein's third and best album to date. It begins slow and then hits you like a German leopard tank on the war path after the first 50 seconds with Mein Herz Brennt. The album remains heavy all the way through to the end and finishes up with a soft melodic symphony entitled Nebel. Every song on the album has its own flavour, nothing here sounds the same and every song is enjoyable to listen to. There is no reject material here folks. This album is a benchmark in the Industrial style of Heavy Metal. People who boast about Extreme Underground Metal bands in the Black, Death, Doom, Thrash, Goth styles such as Dimmu Borgir, In Flames, Cradle of Filth, Dark Tranquility, Hypocrisy, Moonspell, Tiamat, Emperor, Crematory, Carcass, Hammerfall, Anthrax, you name it, - non can compare to the polished perfection of the German Industrial Metal Bomb that is Rammstein. Get this album, - it's a must!
B0000640SA|2.0|this movie was extremely bad how can people say its good basically u see guy kill someone at the begginig which really is the ending then it slowly rewinds backwards explaining how he came to be there why he did it and so on. Its so hard to watch because none of the scenes hold out long enough each past event is by the most 5 min and by least a min. then they go to the time before that. He ceriously in this movie forgets everything like a hundred times over so so boring and the ending is boring because its really suppose to be the beggining dont expect this to be an action film cause its not i dont really know what kind of film this is. I only gave it two stars cause guy is in it and he always does a fantastic job. But definitly not a movie to buy if your realy keen on watching it rent it instead because this is not the movie for the average only for those who say a movies great because they are lost and confused in the end me personally i like to see a movie that leaves you feeling like youve learned something from the movie but this does not do that it just leaves you very dissapointed.

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|This was one of those movies that somehow, I'd never even heard of it when it was in the theaters but when strolling through a DVD store one day and seeing Halle Berry on a cover, it immediately drew my attention to this great movie.  That being said, this is a fairly good psychological/super natural type thriller that doesn't suffer greatly from the predictability factor and in general entertains from the first scene to the last with some seriously intriguing twists.<br />Performance wise, Halle Berry definitely gives and outstanding performance in this film showing a range of acting I'd previously not thought her capable of.  Everybody's favorite addict in Robert Downey Jr. performs well in this movie albeit a somewhat subdued role for him in comparison to previous roles I've seen him in.  Charles S. Dutton's role in this film is fairly limited which unfortunately doesn't give him much opportunity to show off his talents.  Penelope Cruz's performance is fairly limited in this film as well!<br />This is the first film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz that I've watched and I would definitely have to say that his films may be ones to watch out for as this film is presented in a wonderful manner from beginning to end.<br />The Premise:<br />Halle Berry plays criminal psychologist Dr. Miranda Grey who works at Woodward Penitentiary for Women.  She appears to be a highly respected employee at the prison and is married to her boss, Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles S. Dutton).  Not long after leaving work and heading home in a storm she nearly runs someone over in the middle of the road and has an accident...  She wakes up a few days later to find that she's now a patient in the penitentiary that she worked in and she's been accused of killing her own husband...<br />What follows from there is a well made psychological/super natural thriller that will, as stated above, entertain from the very first scene to the last as the story is extremely well scripted, directed and played out by the actors.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Commentary by Director Mathieu Kassovitz and Director of Photography Matthew Libatique<BR>-Limp Bizkit &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; Music Video
B0001611DI|3.0|I'm sorry...cult horror fans seem to love this movie, but it wasn't all that great. I didn't quite get why the zombies were blue. The acting was bad, or was it the script? It was very gory, which was a plus, but it didn't save the film. While the first dead movie, 'Night', was very good and original, 'Dawn' is boring and unimaginative. I haven't seen 'Day' so I can't compare it to this, but if you like zombie movies and are interested in the Dead trilogy, check out the original Night of the living dead, or the remake of Dawn of the dead, which was awesome.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is one of the best movies that i have had the privilage of viewing in my entire life.  Tarentino should be diefied for having produced this movie.  The incredible combination of music, action, drama, and beautiful contrast should be recognised throughout the movie world
B00014TJUC|5.0|Many Divine Comedy fans were ambivalent towards Mr. Hannon's last CD, 'Regeneration'. The change from the humorous, 'nod-and-wink' music that comprised much of Hannon's back catalog was too radical for some. I, however, enjoyed the record on its own merits. That said, I had one reservation concerning that Nigel Godrich-produced effort: Despite its accomplished veneer, there seemed to be a 'Let It Be' weariness that permeated the songs. I was vaguely apprehensive that 'Regeneration' would be the final D.C. release. Subconsciously, I reserved final opinion on the CD until I heard some new music...<br /> 'Absent Friends' is an extraordinary achievement. The eleven songs on the CD flow into each other very well. While all the songs are beautifully rendered, I do have some particular favorites:<br />   The final track, 'Charmed Life', has one of the greatest lyrical melodies I've ever heard. 'My Imaginary Friend' is very charming. 'Leaving Today' approaches epic proportions. 'Come Home Billy Bird' shows Mr. Hannon's love of words and, along with 'The Happy Goth', a surprising lack of sarcasm for their respective subjects. But special mention should be given to 'The Wreck of the Beautiful', a hypnotic song about a ship during its final journey; the backing vocals do a remarkable job of conjuring an underwater world in which the 'Beautiful' is laid to rest.<br />  A side note: With the less-than-congenial split from long-time friends who comprised the group since 'Casanova' in mind (the complaints centered on record contracts, salaries, creative input, etc.), fans should find Neil's homage to the cover art for David Bowie's 1970 record 'The Man Who Sold The World' fascinating...<br />  Get this record!

B00005KAQP|4.0|Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldburg) is a Reno lounge singer whose life is going nowhere fast.  She just saw her married lover, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), a mob boss, kill a man and is in fear for her life.  Deloris didn't want to cooperate with the police, but she wanted to live.  However, after finding out where the police were planning on stashing her, Deloris wished that she was dead.  How on earth was she supposed to pass herself off as a nun in a convent?  Still, Deloris was determined to give it her best shot and became Sister Mary Clarence.<br />Deloris/Sister Mary Clarence hadn't been in the convent for a day before she was already causing problems and being called before Mother Superior (Maggie Smith).  Mother Superior didn't know what to do with Sister Mary Clarence, but the perfect solution presented itself when she saw how Sister Mary Clarence reacted to the atrocious choir performance on Sunday.  She promptly informed Sister Mary Clarence that she would be in charge of the choir and felt that that would keep her out of mischief.  However, before too long, Sister Mary Clarence had the whole choir rocking and rolling as she took traditional religious songs and rocked them up and rock songs and made them religious.  Unfortunately, Mary Clarence's many good works could not go unnoticed for long and she soon found the mob hot on her trail...<br />Sister Act is a funny, entertaining movie that just makes you laugh.  The role of Deloris/Sister Mary Clarence was tailor made for Whoopi Goldberg and you can just tell that she is having a wonderful time.  The supporting cast, led by Maggie Smith (Mother Superior), Kathy Najimy (Sister Mary Patrick), Wendy Makkena (Sister Mary Robert) and Mary Wickes (Sister Mary Lazarus) was also superb and each actress brought her own unique charm into her role.  If you are looking for a fast, fun, hilarious movie that you can watch with the whole family - and sing along with, too! - this is a great choice!
B0001CNRS4|5.0|Slammin' goddess Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) cares for the ghetto and vows to buy back a dance studio in ruins. Of course she does and all the children are happy. &quot;Honey&quot; made me get off me feet and I started to bounce to those bomb hip-hop beats. Break dancing and all, I cheered for Honey's inspirational dances. That one director dude said something really funny like, &quot;Why you gotta play me like that, bee-atch!&quot; Then Honey walked out on him, end of story. I don't care if this kind of story has been made a million times, Alba's performance was one of a kind. A monumental achievement in movie history! Heart-warming adventure!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|We found ourselves at the cineplex on vacation and \\"Big Fish \\" was the next movie playing, so we bought tickets! My children and we all thought the movie was \\"way\\" cool, but we are at a loss to explain why we think that. Perhaps because for once in recent films that blurred line between fantasy and reality ends up creating positive and optimistic sentiments versus so many films which seem to be using fantasy today to create darker versions of reality. The stories within the story are interesting too. A gentle giant, a spooky wood, a war, a sort of Brigadoon concept of a town (well, sort of!)... As with other reviewers here, I am having a hard time thinking of words to describe the movie.I can say that it should probably be watched as though you were in a movie theater, ie. a dark room with no distractions.In my opinion it is one of those movies you don't really want to put on \\"pause\\" either.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Some poeple think that Metallica has become a sell-out band.  Others think they;ve just changed their style, this album proves that they still can rock with the best and mix well with the classics.  When I first put in this album I thought that it would be just like any other greatest hits album with some violins.  After the first three tracks I definetly was proven wrong.  Metallica brought back some of their old songs and some new songs to make this album complete.  The orchestra adds a whole new dimension to the music that I didn't think was possible.  All in all a very good album, a defintie for metallica fans.
0440237688|2.0|I've read this book twice now, about three years apart. I didn't care for it then, and I don't care for it now. Although a somewhat interesting general plot, I never felt the urge to \\"find out what happened next.\\" I don't know why this book is hailed as one of the greatest books ever written, a modern classic. The characters seemed dull and one-dimesional. The plot, although unique in some ways, just seemed mashed together from several different stories written before. I do understand this is a children's book, though I do not see what everybody sees in this below average exploration in dystopias and human nature.<br />For books about dystopias and human nature, I suggest reading more interesting novels such as 1984, Brave New World, A Clockwork Orange, the Dune Chronicles, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Bonfire of the Vanities, Mother Night, etc. For some good short stories, read Harrison Bergeron, Those Who Walk Away From Omelas, The Veldt, and others. <br />Rating - 2 stars - You can pass this one up.
0920668372|1.0|I got the author's point about unconditional love... but I just don't like the fact that this book got some controversy issue. There are many ways of showing unconditional love in better ways than \\"stalking\\" the loved ones.  no? And plus, I just don't like the setting with single mother and single dad. Why can a children's book depict happier and more ideal surrounding? Just for the fact that either people love this book with tears coming out or hate it to throw it away, i would not read this to my little one. There are many ways I can show her my unconditional love... I wouldn't want to be following my child around (for the ones who loved this book, I can understand) but I rather just be there for her whenever she needs me...
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix: Revolutions picks up right where The Matrix: Reloaded left off, so everyone is trying to figure out what happened to Neo (Keanu Reeves) and how to save him.  But when Neo finally gets out of the Matrix, he comes back changed and he has discovered some disturbing information that will force him to make some difficult decisions.  Neo finds that he can't even confide in Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and that, although he is still The One, he doesn't quite believe that he can make a difference anymore.  After spending a lot of time alone, Neo comes to the conclusion that he must go up to the surface and fight the machines on the old battleground, not just through the matrix.  His other teammates try and dissuade him, but with Trinity by his side, Neo heads for the surface.  Little does he know that Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has a few surprises in store for him along the way...<br />Meanwhile, the rest of the crew heads back to Zion, all too aware that the fate of humankind may rest on their shoulders.  For while they are trying to avoid the machines on their way home, the machines are attacking Zion and are programmed to destroy every living thing that remains.  The inhabitants of Zion are not about to let their city go without a fight, however, and they use all of their old machinery and ammunition to try and keep the machines at bay.  The Council will do just about anything to buy Neo more time, because in these last desperate hours all they have is hope...<br />I thought that this movie was wonderful in some ways and a disappointment in others.  First off, I have to admit that I hated the ending.  I can't quite figure out if the directors were trying to leave the Matrix open for future sequels or if they just wanted to stay all mystical and let people draw their own conclusions.  I disagree with others, however, in that they say that the directors never answered any of their questions - the directors never made any plans to answer questions and from the outset it was obvious that the Matrix was always going to be a kind of shadowland that kept its own secrets.  Most of the special effects were still amazing, but I expected this and almost expected them to be even better because this was the third and final movie in the trilogy and it should have just knocked my socks off.  If anyone else had done the special effects, I probably would have been a lot more impressed, but the directors raised the bar so high with the first film that they were their own worst enemies.  I was also a bit disappointed that they relied so heavily on CGI instead of on stunt work because that was what made all of the fight scenes so cool.  This movie was also quite a bit drabber than the others because there was hardly any time spent in the Matrix and I have to admit that I missed all of the sweet outfits they used to wear there.  On the positive side, there were some great scenes in Zion as individuals fought hard to withstand the machines and one of my favorite characters was the Kid (Clayton Watson) who worshipped Neo and turned out to be a hero.  There were some touching moments between Link and his wife and Hugo Weaving, playing Agent Smith, was a great villain.  The sets were still incredibly imaginative and there were some fun one-liners as well, so there are some good parts to the movie.  All in all, I must admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre and felt that it was money well spent, but it wasn't the spectacular finish that I had envisioned...et it was obvious that the Matrix was always going to be a kind of shadowland that kept its own secrets.

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Dr. Miranda Grey (goddess Halle Berry) was a top psychologist until she murdered Fat Albert. After an encounter with a strange girl in the rain, Grey supposedly went mental and became a patient in the ward. Of course, \\"Gothika\\" takes place in an extremely dark place where lights don't exist and people have that one-eyed pirate stare. The token buddy (Robert Downey Jr.) doesn't add much to the movie either. Well, I don't want to give away too much information because it's predictable enough even for a ten year-old to figure out. The movie reminded me of \\"What Lies Beneath\\" and it actually has a couple of boo-yah! scenes. If you're a hardcore fan of the horror genre, you might like this. But, if you're an amateur that scares easily, I recommend you don't wear white pants because by the end of the movie you might be wearing brown pants. Chocolate pudding... Doh!
B0001Z363W|5.0|like Zakk Wylde! Arguably the hardest working musician in the business. Wylde consistently releases top quality albums at a staggering pace (usually at the rate of 1 per year). In my opinion, Wylde is the male version of Janis Joplin. Powerful and heartfelt vocals that you can feel...pouring his soul into his work. All of the tracks on the album are great, but my personal favorites are Queen of Sorrow, Steppin' Stone, Won't Find It Here, Damage Is Done, and Once More. If you want to hear real music by one of the greatest musicians of our time, then pick up Hangover Music Vol 6 today! Bleed Black Label!

B0001AVZA8|2.0|If the movie starts greatly, it sure ends really badly. The last 40 minutes are just a waste and repeat the exact same jokes than in the beginning. <br />The story is not the exact same one than in \\"as Good as it gets\\" but you can feel that it is a copycat, and unfortunately, a really poor one. Watch it once if you can't help it, but please, even if you have watched it ten times, \\"As good as it gets\\" is way over this one. We can't even compare them because \\"Something's gotta give\\" just seems lame next to it.<br />The only thing that made me give a 2-stars is because the actors are great, but the story is so poor.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Ok, so maybe that particular concept was already done in Heinlein's Starship Troopers novel, but let's face it - this is much cooler.<br />Some great things about this movie:<br />1) The setting and effects!  I know a movie rocks when it was made in the mid 80's and still has the best effects in a scifi / action fusion movie I've ever seen.  Yeah, even better than the Matrix.  I didn't see Keanu piloting a dropship.  The colony is also completely convincing, as are sets like the Medlab and the Alien Hive in Sublevel 3.<br />2) The action!  Cameron spends enough time at the beginning setting up the story and the characters, and BAM.  Two thirds of them die in one big rockin' firefight.  Then we have a nice fancy dropship accident (once again, how'd they make that look so cool??), Vasquez being her badass self in the air vents, Ripley finding the Queen, and just when you think there can't be anymore, UH OH!  Looks like you shoulda laid off that non-dairy creamer Bishop!<br />3) The characters.  Talk about great acting!  We have Ripley who rocks as usual, Beihn doing his usual &quot;calm and collected quiet leader&quot; thing, Hudson with the greatest lines in movie history (&quot;Why don't you put her in charge???&quot;), Burke as a slimy corporate villain with some great furtive looking facial/eye expressions, and Apone with REAL LIFE military experience (he was the first black sergeant in Vietnam or something, I think).  I mean, look at how cool Drake is - this guy could be the lead role in a low-budget, fun-on-a-weekday-evening scifi movie, and he's ALIEN FOOD in this one!<br />The DVD rocks too.  The added footage lends more depth to the movie, I think, because you get to see the colony fully operational before it's destroyed.  You also feel more empathy for Newt after seeing her family, and Ripley gains more character depth.  I've heard criticisms that the sentry guns make the aliens look weak and powerless, but since I'm a fan of a certain computer game featuring sentry guns (Yeah, TFC baby!) I gotta say I loved 'em.<br />Only thing I wish was included in the DVD was the &quot;lost scene&quot; in which Ripley finds Burke cocooned while looking for Newt.  Even if Cameron thought the acting was bad, it would have been nice to include that at least for the hardcore fans...  after all, really casual viewers aren't going to buy a DVD.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|If you liked the old rock, you will love Jet. By the time the first song is over, you will be begging to hear more. Strong drum riffs and excellent guitarists rule this band. There are some softer songs, but overall, this CD is EXCELLENT!
B00006J3WH|5.0|First of all, if you don't like musicals you shouldn't buy this. But since you're reading this you probably have some sort of idea what buying this cd would imply so whatever. <br />Personally, my favorite track on this entire CD would have to be the suite to &quot;Hush&quot; but that's only because of the fact that I'm always doing homework while I'm listening to it so I always get caught unexpected during the screechysounds.  <br />But anyway this CD is an excellent buy and it's good especially if you want to spend the money for it.  If you can buy a copy with a slightly lower cost, I say go for it but it's an excellent CD either way.  Better than a lot of CDs I have from musicals on broadway.  <br />Although I definitely need to say that while the singers weren't all that great they were better than would be expected for random people from TV.  And you can tell it wasn't all faked cuz half of the people sound umm sorta bad.  Oh well.<br />It's excellent anyway.
B0001Z363W|4.0|Another solid effort from Zakk Wylde, in the vein of &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; shows us again why he's one of the best things happening in this genre right now. I really enjoyed his last album, &quot;The Blessed Hellride&quot; (probably my favorite overall album of his) - and was anxious to pick up &quot;Hangover Music&quot; - so I rushed to my local music store today. Here's my song breakdown:<br />1. Crazy or High - Easily one of the best songs on the album. A great way to start it off. Grade: A<BR>2. Queen of Sorrow - Another one of my favorites on the album. Like &quot;Crazy or High,&quot; a good upbeat acoustic/electric song. Grade: A-<BR>3. Steppin Stone - A pretty good track. Grade: B<BR>4. Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow - Didn't really like this track to be honest. A little to Blah. Not terrible but easily one of the few unlikeable tracks on the album. Grade: D+<BR>5. Takillya (estyabon) - A short instrumental in the vein of &quot;Speedball&quot; My only complaint with this one is it could have been longer and more thought out. Grade: C+<BR>6. Won't Find It Here - Another one of favorites on the album. A quality track. Grade: A<BR>7. She Deserves a Free Ride - This is the worst song on the album. Hands down. The chorus is terrible. I have to wonder how drunk he was when he wrote this one. Maybe one of the worst songs I've ever heard from Zakk. Grade: F<BR>8. House of Doom - A good acoustic/electric track with a good chorus and melody. Grade: B+<BR>9. Damage is Done - A great song. Very emotional. Grade: A-<BR>10. Layne - A fitting tribute to Layne Staley of Alice in Chains. Reminds me a little of an Alice in Chains song. Especially the verses. Grade: B<BR>11. Woman Don't Cry - A little sappy and repetitive. Not a bad song, but not one of my favorites. Grade: C<BR>12. No Other - Another great track and the last of my favorites on the record. Very addicitive. Grade: A<BR>13. Whiter Shade of Pale - I was never really crazy about the original version of this song,so needless to say, I'm not that crazy about Zakk's version either. It's not bad, just not my style really. Grade: C-<BR>14. Once More - A good track in the vein of &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; Grade: B<BR>15. Fear - Another good track. And overall, not a bad way to end the album. Grade: B<br />OVERALL GRADE: B+<br />Another solid effort from Zakk. While not as good as the previous &quot;The Blessed Hellride,&quot; it's a worthy addition to Zakk's catalog. My favorite tracks are: Crazy or High, Queen of Sorrow, Won't Find It Here, and No Other, but most of the tracks, minus 2 or 3 are pretty damn good. I would definitely recommend picking this one up.
B00000IQC8|3.0|but by the time you are 30, you'll know and understand everything this film has to say.  I'm an old fart, thus I didn't really learn anything from Clerks, but it had some interesting parts from a cinematic perspective.  Net, net, don't see this unless you are under 30, or are really interested in film.
0694013889|5.0|Got this book AGES ago for my older daughter, now almost 10.  Well, my 18 month old daughter \\"discovered\\" it about a month ago - though she's not ready to start potty training just yet - she LOVES THIS BOOK!  She asks us to read it at least 6-8 times a day, and when we aren't reading it to her, she looks through it on her own.  She understands more and more what the whole issue is, and this book might be the \\"cause\\" of her potty training EARLY!  How much does she love this book??  Two days ago, one of the pages fell out - and I can't figure out how to fix it - she has been upset and crying over the loss of this book since then - I have to get a new one (that's why I'm here!).
B0000542D2|4.0|Lots of shaky close ups, sreaming girls and mayhem!!Made on a small budget that really shows, it is full of a lot of unscrpited antics and a pretty feeble plot thats barely there.<BR>But the music!! Besides the poor photography, this is still <BR>a fantastic view of the Fab four when they first began just being themselves. Full of fun and great comical sight gags (Go Ringo!!)<BR>Probably not worth the money and listening to the people involved in the film recalling their memories of fourty years ago can get a bit boring unless you are a true beatles nut.<BR>But after all this there is still captured a sense of absolute hysteria that was born then and it grabs you!!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|What happened to all of the the ideals of the first movie's quest for freedom? The ending of this movie just felt like all of the elements of the story simultaneously crashing down. Morpheus' role was reduced to being passenger in a long chase. Neo was inexplicably sent to the trainman's domain. Bane(Real world Smith) blinds Neo. Trinity is killed in a depressing scene, then Neo drudges on to finish (albeit in the awesome super burly brawl) his christ metaphor, which only leads to the half assed ending where humans are still in slavery, the only difference being zion will no longer be persecuted. I just walked away from this dissapointed, and after watching it again I still felt the same way... 6/10<br />I loved the first matrix movie for its incredible ideas, story, visual effects, and perfect dialog. This was a damn near perfect movie. 10/10<br />The Reloaded introduced very interesting characters (the programs, not so much the humans), AWESOME special effects, good dialog from Morpheus and Smith. It had a somewhat convoluted, but decent plot. 8/10
6303314015|5.0|Disney can't make real life movies but they can sure do animated films well! I watched this movie since elementary and have recently watched it and, its so good that I am still extremely satisfied with it even till now. All of the films I watch as a good isn't good anymore when I rewatch them now. Higher taste. I watched this movie 30+ times. You'll watch it as much if you have a babysitter who lives in a bad neighborhood with no cable and nothing to do.<br />The music is fantastic and very well placed. The scenary is awesome. They don't abuse graphics or go for something too over there head which turns out horrible later on. This is the type of film you can watch over and over again without it losing much meaning and sense.<br />I mean, it really doesn't get much better than this. IN MY OPINION.
0571202284|5.0|This book is essential if you're just getting started in animation, and I suspect it would prove equally useful to someone with experience too.<br />It's well-written, funny, and accessible. It's worth reading just for William's anecdotes about the business and the people.<br />It covers the history of animation in such a way that modern techniques make sense within context. Most books treat the history in boring, unimaginative ways. Not Williams.<br />It offers a wealth of practical, how-to information. Want to know how to make characters stride, using only two poses? Williams tells you. When should you use &quot;ones&quot; and &quot;two's&quot;? It's in there. How can you troubleshoot your work before you're too far into a project? He covers this too.<br />Williams doesn't just give you a toolbox full of tips and tricks though -- by the end of this book you'll understand _why_ things work the way they work. The result? You'll be ready to handle even the new and unexpected as you pursue animation.
B0001Z363W|5.0|If you are a fan of BLS or Zakk Wylde then you need to pick up this motherf***er. This is a kickass album that will not leave my cd player for a very long f***in' time. Stick with BLS; you can't go wrong.
B00005JMSE|3.0|Ron Perlman effectively carries this film when the plot mechanics bog down the story. He's funny and violent and vulnerable, perfect.  If he doesn't work, the film doesn't. One thing that I disagree with about the film is that it shouldn't be rated pg-13.  There's a lot a violent and gruesome content in this film and it's combined with occultic themes, kids shouldn't be seeing this stuff, that's all.  I had the same quibbles with the Lord of the Rings, they pushes R rated violence into the pg-13 territory because they wanted to make their money back. Enough of my puritanical rant, I just feel that this movie earns the R and doesn't end up getting it, that's all. By the way, kudos to Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a character who you don't like and is still OK to like at the end because he's such a obnoxious dufus. To all who've seen it, I hope you stuck around for the credits to catch a little bit more of him.
B0000047CX|5.0|I do not know a word of Portugese, but I can sing &quot;The Girl From Impanema&quot; by heart -- in Portugese. That's how many times I've played this album.<br />If you can and have the means to play it, get this in its original LP format. But the CD is most excellent as well, and if you haven't ever heard it, I encourage you to buy it right now; you won't be disappointed.
B000069KGM|1.0|Chicago (or, as they were known on THIS album,&quot;C.T.A&quot;): Tuneless songs...amateur vocals.....a horn section that sounded like it was lifted from a Holiday Inn somewhere south of Atlanta, GA...  OK, like Milli Vanilli didn't say, &quot;Girl, You KNOW It's TRUE.&quot;  But the one thing that blatantly shows (heck, &quot;displays,&quot; or better, &quot;throws in your face&quot;) just what a bunch of pre-fab commercial nincompoop sludgemongers these creeps were, was their very own self-introduction on the left side of that fold-out album cover:  &quot;With this album, we dedicate our lives and our energies to the (giggle) revolution.&quot;  THIS, from the &quot;band&quot; that gave you &quot;Color My World&quot; and &quot;Does Anybody Know What Time It Is?&quot;  But re that &quot;revolution,&quot; guess I'd better start rolling some bandages or something, huh?   OH......you mean there WASN'T a &quot;revolution?&quot;
B00004TJWE|4.0|Yet another CD I wound up with as I was recently going through my stack. Forgotten just as to how GOOD 'S. F. Sorrow' really is.Some say it's the first ever rock opera to make it onto a record. Call me crazy, but this album very much reminds me of the Beatles 'Sgt.Peppers' era. With it's rich harmony vocals, well written arrangements and catchy lyrics, it's hard not to thoroughly enjoy this -much- under appreciated UK psychedelic band. From looking through the well assembled 18-page booklet, I can see that Pink Fairies drummer Twink appears on several tracks. Four bonus tunes are tagged on to the original lp that are JUST as good as the lp is.Songs I liked best were &#34;S. F. Sorrow Is Born&#34;, &#34;Baron Saturday&#34;, the beautiful &#34;I See You&#34;, &#34;Trust&#34; and &#34;Old Man Going&#34;. Worthy reissue, to say the least.
B00003CXE7|3.0|There was ALOT of hype surrounding this movie. I watched Braveheart(5), The Patriot(4) and Gladiator(3) back to back. I would rank them in that order 1,2 &amp; 3.  I hate sitting on the fence by giving it 3 stars.  However I think it is a bronze medal performance.<BR>Good enough to watch, but maybe not good enough to add to your own DVD collection.  Watching it once was enough for me.  Maybe go rent it.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|IT'S OK.....THE USUAL LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM TYPE PRODUCTION, GREAT SONG, FOLLOWED BY MEDIOCRE SONG.  &quot;SNICKS&quot; IS IN PRETTY GOOD VOCAL FORM, FOR HER VOICE.  THE BASS AND DRUMS ARE VERY GOOD, CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF TIME MCVIE, AND FLEETWOOD HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER. THEY PLAY AS ONE.<br />AS TO CHRISTINE MCVIE'S ABSENCE......SHE IS MISSED GREATLY, HER STYLE, HER VOICE, WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT TO FLEETWOOD MAC THAN WAS REALIZED.  MORES THE PITY, SHE HAS &quot;RETIRED&quot;, IT IS OUR SINCERE LOSS.  MORE FLEETWOOD MAC RESPONSIBILITY HAS PASSED TO BUCKINGHAM-NICKS.  WITHOUT A VEHICLE LIKE FLEETWOOD MAC TO DRIVE AROUND IN, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE MADE IT, BUT NO WHERE TO THE SCALE THEY HAVE.
0385335482|5.0|I bought all three of the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; books on a whim, and am SO glad I did.  I really loved this book, the first of the three, and am currently in the middle of the second which I cannot wait to finish.  These books are laugh-out-loud funny, and the story lines are engrossing which makes them fast reading and really hard to put down.  Sophie Kinsella is a wonderful writer... I'm an editor and I wish she were on my staff!  The main character, Becky Bloomwood, remains extremely likable even though she's exasperatingly irresponsible at times.  The characters are wonderfuly defined and Kinsella makes the reader step right into the book and &quot;be there&quot; as it all unfolds.  Trust me, you'll be hooked on the series after this first book.  More, please!
B0001AP12G|4.0|When I first heard &quot;Guess who's Back&quot; I had to know who produced it, I later found out that it was produced by Kanye West from Chicago and thought this guy is going to be tight. Then I heard he was rapper and said please no more Dre's and Timbo's please. Then I heard &quot;We are the Champions&quot; and I was like he can kind of spit. Then comes his debut &quot;College Dropout&quot;. This is a very good album and better than most of the garbage put out nowadays. My only gripe is the amount of skits he overdid it. This guy must be really mad because he couldn't graduate from college, because every skit disses college which isn't as hard as he makes it seem. This guy may take over the R.O.C if Bleek doesn't step up. Everyone wants to bring him down for heavy sampling but if it sounds good who cares. Other than that a pleasant surprise from Kanyeeze. The production on this album is stellar and the lyrics are average. Anyone that cansiders him a lyricist doesn't know hip-hop. <BR>Best Tracks: We Don't Care 5/5(Very insprirational) , School Spirit 5/5(nice anthem to step to), Get Em High 4/5,(Common killed this joint), Spaceship 4/5(nice soulful feel), and All Falls Down.
B00003CX95|5.0|Is it accruate?  Don't know.  Is it entertaining?   I would say yes!   I watched Braveheart, The Patriot and Gladiator back to back. I would rank them in that order 1,2 & 3 starting with Braveheart.  I would rate it a 4.5 to a 5 starts.  As you might already know, these are not \\"chick flicks\\". They include too much  fighting, blood, guts and death to be considered a date movie. You know what I mean, at the end of the night when it is a question of what to watch these usually get pushed to the bottom of the list because they don't have a happy ending.    I think movies like these are viewed for the feelings you experience while rooting the characters on to victory not just the gore of battle.  I picked up on the general themes of bonding, team work, fraternity and living for a higher purpose.  It must be a guy thing I guess.....Overall, the story is told in an engaging manner and the sets in addition to the costumes are done VERY well.    One negative: I must say it is quite long, so put the kids to bed early and disconnect the phone if you want to get through it in a single evening.  Add it to your collection.
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball is one of the most intriguing and insightful baseball novels we have ever read. The Oakland A's uncharacteristic approach to baseball is shown by the scouting and statisticians who have helped change the way the game is played. By drafting players who weren't seen fit to be picked in the first few rounds, the A's were able to sign them to a weaker contract than the normal players that got paid millions more for being a spot a head or behind in the draft.<br />In the novel, Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta use the statistical analysis to predict what the team would need to win for the  A's to make it to the playoffs.  With mind-boggling formulas, they where able to break down every action on the field into a point system and from there they were able to determine what exactly the team would need in runs to win.  <br />In our opinion, it is the duty of every general manager and owner in baseball to pick up this book and learn about the genius that is Billy Beane. Any time a small market organization can turn into consistent powerhouse, the league and world should learn from their accomplishments.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I felt sorry for this movie for losing out at this years Oscars to Peter Jacksons - Return of the King, and feel that against any other competition it would have certainly swept the board. Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Aubrey, guiding his ship and crew in a search & destroy mission against an enemy French vessel of superior fire power and speed. My brother actually commented that you could almost \\"smell the bilge\\" whilst watching this movie, and I have to more than agree in it's attention to detail, and wonderful realism. The vast spectacle of it all is let down a little however by a fairly mediocre storyline, but despite this and a marginally annoying ending (let's leave the door open for a sequel) it is thoroughly enjoyable. Certain to be one of the DVD releases of the year there are some nice extra's on the 2nd disc, this collectors edition will run you around and extra $10, but the goodies are worth it, and the standard version has no special features at all. All of the performances are strong, and the power of the movie lies not only in it's breathtaking art direction, but also in the viewer being completely pulled in to the lives and actions of the main characters. Mild violence, and some graphic war scenes probably proclude this from a mainstream family audience, but otherwise it is a true sea faring \\"ripping yarn\\", full of high adventure, excitement, and plenty of swashbuckling thrown in. Good for a least a couple of viewings, this is probably a safe bet for the home collection, instead of merely renting. 4.5 Stars.
B00005JMEW|3.0|The thing I took from this movie most of all is... how I saw more severed limbs and heads and open wounds squirting out blood. This river of blood was crazy,the blood would pour out from the wounds and then squirt across these huge rooms like it was under high pressure. I wish my water lines had this kind of pressure. One dude got his head severed and the blood came out so strong it knocked two other guys down it looked like a fire hose!! We all watched with our jaws slack as Uma hacked and sliced and cut and stabbed the whole Deadly 88's gang. there was so much blood.. oh my so much....how did the actors stand up?
B000002H33|4.0|After playing deafening, all-out thrash on 1984's Ride the Lightning, Metallica went for a more subtle, progressive approach. Although this CD does have its 100 MPH moments, some of the material is moody and a bit slowed down like Orion and The Thing That Should Not Be. The ballad, Sanitaruim (Welcom Home), is one of Metallica's most progressive moments ever. Also one of their best. But on many tracks, the progressiveness was subtle enough to please the thrash fans, while appealing to a different crowd. My word : buy this album, you will buying a piece of metallic history.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I fail to understand Lucas' motivations for releasing these on DVD now, with no doubt a year to go on the full Star Wars Saga DVD set. Unless it's all about marketing, smooching the fans' boohineys by dropping this in their midst with a cleverly placed preview of his upcoming theatrical release of Episode III. The smart thing would have been to release the original theatrical versions of these now and the full Saga next year. Lord knows, I'd certainly buy both if that were the case. But, since it isn't I guess I'll be waiting one more year...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|After almost falling over mountains of &quot;rave&quot; reviews for this move, including the High Impact &quot;Over 80 4 Star Reviews&quot; on the DVD sleeve, I was more than a little disappointed with this movie. An Oscar nod for Sofia Copola had also led me to believe that this would be something special, but even as a fan of Bill Murray I find it hard to recommend. A very slow beginning finds Bill Murray out of his depth in Tokyo as a flagging actor promoting a brand of whiskey. Anyone who has ever been to Tokyo will know it is NOT a very visitor friendly place, from the point of view of little, or no maps, tourist information, direction signs, assistance, or even menu's printed in English (or any other language except Japanese for that matter) and Ms Copola tries hard to portray this, and the quirky Japanese culture on screen at every given moment. Sadly though, this, and the gentle, if unlikely romantic chemistry between this lost actor in a failing marriage, and young newlywed unsure of her decision or life in general, that could be full of hilarious nuances just doesn't come across. I found myself skipping forward just to see if ANYTHING was going to happen, but was left feeling like a waste of just over 1hr 40 mins. I'm sorry to be arguing with so many critics praising this as a GREAT MOVIE, but perhaps like the title says, the comedy, story and enjoyment, was a least for me - Lost in the Translation.
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't normally purchase CDs on impulse; I usually badger friends to hear at least 4 or 5 tracks before making up my mind whether I like an artist.  I broke that pattern completely with _Fallen_, purchasing it simply on the strength of &quot;Bring Me To Life.&quot;<br />I completely fell in love with this group.  The album is amazing both as a whole and with each song taken individually.  The songs have a raw power both musically and lyrically that is enhanced by Amy Lee's no-holds-barred style of singing.  Some of the songs are 'loud' and fast (such as &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot;) while others are soft and sweet (&quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello.&quot;)  The lyrics convey a really interesting combination of both immense sorrow and great hope.<br />Overall, I really love this album--it has a lot of lyrics I can identify with, and I've been known to just sit and lose myself in the music.<br />Incidentally, if you liked _Fallen_, it's incredibly worthwhile to track down their older albums and miscellaneous tracks if you can.  The older albums don't &quot;fit&quot; together as a whole as well as _Fallen_ does, but many of the individual songs are far more powerful than those on _Fallen_.  I've been listening to Evanescence's music pretty much nonstop for over a year now, and I'm not tired of it yet.  They're just amazing--definitely one of my best music purchases to date.
B00005K9LK|4.0|I'm gonna give u a little rundown on this album here. Okay?<BR> <BR>The Hellion/Electric Eye: Very good opener for a bombastic album like this. Love the Electric Eye riff.<br />Riding On The Wind: Very cool song. Great to drive to.<br />Bloodstone: Not the best song on the album. Nothing to go nuts over<br />(Take These) Chains: Kinda commercial, but very good nontheless.<br />Pain And Pleasure: Wonderful, catchy chorus amid cool riffin'.<br />Screaming For Vengeance: A very heavy, speedy song. Definitely a metal classic.<br />Youv'e Got Another Thing Comin': The most famous Priest song. A wonderful metallic groove.<br />Fever: The very definition of melodic metal. Cool chorus and dazzling lyrics.<br />Devil's Child: Kinda commercial, but exremely good.<br />Prisoner Of Your Eyes: Another dazzling melodic song. One of the best bonus tracks ever to be put on an album.<br />Overall, this is a great album. A little commericial at times, but nonetheless great. Go and buy it.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|Alicia Keys - The Diary of Alicia Keys (J, 2003)    I reviewed this album before and gave it a 3 1/2 but the more I listen to it makes me wanna knock off that half-a-star. First off, the first three tracks (\\"Harlem's Nocturne\\", \\"Karma\\", \\"Heartburn\\") are all weak. \\"Walk On By/If I Was Your Woman\\" desecrated a great Gladys Knight song. And \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" WAS interesting until it got played out and Alicia's \\"baby baby ba-BEEAH\\"s got under my skin. Things really get rolling with \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" and \\"Diary\\". The latter is listed as featuring Tony Toni Ton but there's no Raphael. Dwayne and Timothy are there but they're just playing instruments while some other guy is singing. (Did they just put the group's name down as a marketing ploy? Alicia's name sells itself!) The better songs are \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Nobody Not Really\\". And yes, \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" does sound like \\"Fallin'\\" and, come to think of it, so does \\"Wake Up\\"! An okay album, but I wouldn't be quick to call this album neo-soul or even soul, for Alicia Keys is to neo-soul what Fabolous is to hip-hop: representing the genre well, the mainstream version of it. -EJR
B00009ATIX|1.0|One review hails this film as \\"They don't make Sci Fi films like this any more!\\" and after about 9 minutes watching you can see why (thankfully). Saying that it is protracted, dull, painfully slow and confusing is probably being kind, as what started out as a \\"great idea for a movie\\" has succumb to an over self indulgent directors depiction of a fairly bland screenplay. George Clooney travels to a distant galaxy where he meets his deceased wife via almost tangible flashback sequences and seems to be part of a special mission to discover the meaning of life, or something like it. Unfortunately, when one recalls, or even reads older Sci Fi literature of the type so ground braking by the likes of Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick and the like, one thing is painfully obvious. Great Fiction literature lives and flourishes in the subjective imagination of the reader NOT the viewer. And it is incredibly difficult to succesfully make the transition from page to screen without losing a lot in the process. I have not actaully read the book that this movie is based on, but feel sure this depiction will pale in comparison to a probably reasonable, if pulp style story. This will be one I'm sure Mr Clooney will wish to forget in a hurry, and those that can endure it to the final frame, will no doubt feel the same. Avoid!
B00005JMEW|2.0|And this movie proves that girls can be too. One of the most boring distasteful movies I have ever seen.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I bought this album after hearing Lost Art Of Kepping A Secret on KNAC, thinking it would be okay. How wrong I was. The album is like fuzzed out stoner rock thrown in with heavy metal-ish screaming and thunderous guitars. This album has true power. Anyone who doubts me must listen to Tension Head, Feel Good Hit Of The Summer, Monsters In The Parasol,  or Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret. Even my heavy metal- hating family said it was catchy and good. For the true definition of pure rock, buy this. Also try Stone Temple Pilots.
B0001MDPV8|4.0|Nas - Illmatic (10th Anniversary Platinum Edition) (Sony Music Urban, 2004)    I know what you're thinking: \\"Illmatic, less than five stars?!!\\" No, it ain't like that. Illmatic is of course a hip-hop classic, five stars, maybe even six. But one star has been taken off for Disc 2. It contains the hard-to-find \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" remix and \\"The World is Yours\\" remix. Those are tight, but the remixes to \\"One Love\\" and especially \\"Life's a B****\\" are weak. The former is a clean version while the beat that Rockwilder provided for the latter is one that's better suited for the new Nas, not Illmatic Nas. Fortunately, the disc also contains two new tracks, the Large Professor-produced \\"Star Wars\\" and the Marley Marl-laced \\"On the Real\\", which both show that Nas still got it. So with that, let's stop talking about Illmatic all the time and focus on Nas as of present because he still has skills. -EJR
B000002UAO|2.0|My least favorite of the Beatles major releases as they transitioned from the great rock sound of the previous albums to light pop music like Michelle and You Won't See Me.  Only Drive My Car and If I Needed Someone really rock.  If you like this, be sure to get Revolver too.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Let's review what's here and not what isn't here. Regardless of a few songs that are indeed missing, this is still a 5 star collection. Look on the bright side, if you hate this CD so much and believe that you could have put together the ultimate GNR collection. I say buy the CD's Appetite for Distruction, Lies, & the Use your Illusion disc's and burn your version of GNR's Greatest, it'll be the one and only copy and you'll be satisfied once and for all. Oh and if you hate Axl Rose's voice so much than why do you care to listen to this in the first place, is it just to have your negative reviews posted? Just curious. WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE BITCH!
B00003CXB4|1.0|(...)We had seen the Toy Story movies and Chicken Run and were anxious to see this one, which is supposed to be one of the greatest cartoons of all time. Not so at all. It's a stinking musical! Every other second there is a song. The most annoying are 'Morning Report', ' Circus of Life', and 'Hakuna Matata'. The movie is quite obnoxious, with its vulgar characters and its violence.(...) I can't believe it received a G rating. Should be more like PG, I think. If you are looking for a good, wholesome cartoon for your children, pass this one up. Get the Toy story  movies instead. Those are funny and entertaining, with good morals.
B0001Z363W|3.0|For fans of Black Label Society's brutal riffs and distorted vocals....don't expect much of that on this album. Zakk returns to his Pride &amp; Glory/Book of Shadows roots playing stripped down rock and roll. He is very reminiscent of Joe Cocker on his cover of Procol Harum's &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;. The leadoff track &quot;Crazy or High&quot; sets the tone for this album, sincerely rough. If you are a major Zakk fan, this album will definately please your appetite and cure your hangover in the morning. I thought it was very cool that his Pride &amp; Glory bassist James Lomenzo plays bass on a few tracks to give it that old-school sound!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course all Beatles are great. Classics like I Feel Fine and Paperback Writer are just as good as Yellow Submarine or The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko. They all sold millions.  Rolling Stone says so. Oh it's true! 5-stars!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Don't get me wrong - I'm openminded. I listen to anything from Opeth to From Autumn To Ashes to Enya. I'm a soundtrack addict, too. Music is what keeps me going. But this just might kill me. Well, maybe not. I like one song. A grand total of one song, 'Everytime'. And that's only because it's sad, melodic, and whatnot. But the rest of the CD would've been fine had it just.. not been made. Britney Spears and Christina A-what's-the-spelling cannot be compared anymore. Sure, both were bubble-gum pop once, but CA has graduated beyond that, moreso then Britney Spears ever will. Spears' albums are all the same; dance beats and moans. How many times can she say she's not innocent? Does she have to spell it out in her songs? We all know what sex is - except her youngest fans, of whom she has a lot. It's over-processed, and she isn't even that attractive. And if that's what you're buying the CDs and posters for, guys, get a life. Listen to real music with real emotions before you decide to give anything this manufactured wanna-be churns out. Notice her intials, folks. Cos that's exactly what this album is. ;)
B00009V7T2|5.0|Progressive and album-oriented rock are something you don't see much nowadays. For one, nobody playing today has the inventive musicianship of 1970s bands like King Crimson. Who has the intelligence to use songwriting in a larger palette? Mars Volta is up to the task. When you put this record on, it hits you like a tidal wave. You are wondering what hit you. There are so many sounds and new places they take you. It's definitely an exceptional journey. Most of this record concerns the suicide of a friend. And his resurrection. How Rick Rubin comes into the picture it's not really clear. They recorded this album at his house in Laurel Canyon. John Frusciante and Flea show up on a song or two. Most of the better songs here are ten minutes long, separated by a few interludes. The first part leads to \\"Roulette Dares\\" and all its sheer beauty.  The meat of the album focuses on the trio of songs \\"Drunkship of Lanterns,\\" \\"Eriatarka,\\" and \\"Cicatriz esp.\\" At the end of the day, it is an amazing rock statement. It is also the weirdest album of the year, because it seems so familiar and strange, even after repeated listens. It reminds me of dream states and being half awake and feeling good about life. Mars Volta have their fans out there, even if no one really truly understands what they are doing. They may release a book with a short story that explains all. Their ambition is duly noted.
B00003CXCT|4.0|From what we've been told by StarWars.Com this DVD will be of the 1997 special edition versions. The problems with this release of StarWars on DVD is that it contains only the special edition of the film, and it is a flawed version at best.<BR><br /><BR>I will buy this DVD set, but I am not happy about it. When I saw the special editions of the films in 1997 I was very unhappy with StarWars 4 (A New Hope), (...). I was expecting more from the special edition too. Knowing way too much about the films missing footage, I was disapointed that there wasn't any of the cut sceens with Luke and Biggs at the start of the film. <BR><br /><BR>Empire Stikes Back changes were okay, but I would have liked to seen the Wampa sceen inside of the Rebal base. I would have also liked to have seen how C3PO got torn apart.<BR><br /><BR>Return's only major changes were at the end of the film. The edition of celebrations across the galaxy was goofy.<BR><br /><BR>To tell the truth, I'd to see this DVD set contain 3 versions of the films. The un-modified editions, the 1997 editions and a new mix that fixes the problems with a Star Wars 4 and maybe adds a few new sceens here and there. My guess is that there will be a version on DVD, or HD-DVD, like this in the future and I will be suckered into buying it too.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Meteora sounds exactly like Hybrid Theory, only not even as good.  Not worth the money....I was really disappointed.  Linkin Park needs to seriously work on some NEW stuff.
B00005221M|1.0|The original VHS version is easily one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time, arguably among my top 5. This DVD version, however, doesn't even rank among my top 100. I knew this director's version was \\"different\\" from the original. But I bought it anyway so as to be able to maneuver to my favorite scenes in a way VHS just doesn't afford. Was I in for a shock. A GREAT FILM RUINED!!! It isn't so much what Mann deletes, it's was he reinserts that ruins this DVD. Mr. Mann, there was a reason those scenes and superfluous dialogue were left on the cutting room floor in the first place: they didn't work!<br /><br />When Mann does delete, he inexplicably destroys one of the great scenes in motion picture history -- the cave scene. In the original, Cora implores Hawkeye to leave, arguing that one of them surviving is better than none. It is this that motives Hawkeye to utter the immortal dialogue: \\"No. you stay alive ... I will find you.\\" Well, Mann inexplicably cuts out Cora's antecedent to Hawkeye's response. Instead, after a quick edit, Hawkeye suddenly goes into the dialogue. This kills the moment and ruins the scene.<br /><br />It would have been much better to leave the film as it was, and to offer the additional scenes as extras or alternatives. Whoever is in charge at the studio, please circumvent Mr. Mann and release the original on DVD.
B000065V1V|5.0|If you know anything about music, you know who David Bowie is. He has a pretty flawless streak between the albums Space Oddity to Scary Monsters. That is a great twelve years or so, a good run that stands up against The Beatles or Zeppelin. But at some point Bowie lost the plot. Was it drug addiction? Was is all the bad films he was in? Did he go Hollywood and sell his soul? When I saw him play in a stadium in 1984 during the Serious Moonlight tour I felt cheated. I never bought another Bowie album in my life. While millions of other people probably just discovered him then. Was this the same guy who masterminded the album Low? During the 1980s Bowie collaborated with Toni Basil, Peter Frampton and Mick Jagger. Then there was the mistake on Tin Machine. I see the dollar bins at used record stores lined with them. For a few years now we were all expecting a great Bowie comeback album. Even with Brian Eno, the final efforts were interesting and obscure. Hanging out with Placebo yielded better results. I don't take Bowie serious as a drum and bass man. The key ingredient for Heathen was getting back together with Tony Visconti, who helped out on some of the great Bowie albums of the past especially The Man Who Sold The World.<br />Apparently this record was crafted in upstate New York. The song &quot;Sunday&quot; announces a &quot;beginning to an end.&quot; It's a serious dirge reminiscent of late 1970s Bowie. The second song &quot;Cactus&quot; is a Pixies cover where Bowie plays drums. It is straight forward rock which mixes acoustic and big drum sound and a cool tune. &quot;Slip Away&quot; is more like the stuff Bowie has done on previous albums. It has an interesting lyric about being in New York City where Bowie has spent more time recently. &quot;Slow Burn&quot; teams Bowie with Pete Townshend who was on Scary Monsters too. It is was one of the stand out tracks. Of course he's been playing it a lot on TV recently and it works. &quot;Afraid&quot; is more like some of the stuff he has done with Placebo. The Neil Young cover &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; features Dave Grohl and sounds like it could be a track off Lodger. There are a few forgettable ambient racks in the middle. But &quot;I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship&quot; is a great cover song by The Legendary Stardust Cowboy and it's amazing to know that Bowie played most of the instruments on this record. &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; is a great ballad. There are so many cover songs on this album, that you forget that Bowie has penned some fresh material that probably has more to do with his friendship with Placebo and Grandaddy. This is still a Bowie album. He's older and he's learned from the sins of the past.<br />([...]of the stuff he has done with Placebo.

0385512104|5.0|Christopher, the teenaged narrator and main character of this book, is described on the cover as being Autistic. This is about as accurate as lumping the blind and amputees under the umbrella of &quot;handicapped&quot;. It is an easily-identifiable label, but not in the least helpful in explaining the specifics of the condition.<br />More precisely, Christopher would seem to have Asperger's syndrome. This is often described as a mild version of autism, but as I hear another Asperger's parent say, &quot;there is nothing mild about my son&quot;. Christopher is far too high-functioning to fall in the general category of autistic. Here are the indicators:<br />- Able to distinguish simple facile expressions such as a smile or frown, Christopher cannot, and further will not, interpret subtler facial expressions such as a cocked eyebrow or a &quot;resigned&quot; look. Having Asperger's has rather accurately been described as being like an anthropologist on Mars.<br />- Christopher excels in Maths. But this is not simply a savantism, like Raymond in the movie Rain Man. Rather, it is because Christopher can follow the unwaivering rules required by pure science, and he works continuously at improving those skills.<br />- Christopher is very precise about language. He will employ similes (&quot;He looked like he had two white mice up his nose&quot;) but not metaphor (&quot;she was the apple of his eye&quot;). When asked by his father to make a specific promise, Christopher agrees. But he makes clear to the reader specifically what he agreed to, which falls far short of what his father intended. And here I can introduce a similar example, since my own 10-year boy has been similarly diagnosed. If I ask him &quot;Haven't you finished your homework?&quot; He will answer &quot;No&quot;, if he has completed it. Reason being, if I asked &quot;Have you finished&quot; his answer would be &quot;Yes&quot;, so the inclusion of the &quot;not&quot; in my question must negate his answer. He not trying to be smart-alecky - he is answering in the most honest way he can.<br />- Christopher does not like jokes. Well, he claims not to, but he does tell two of them. Specifically, puns. My son, too, creates riddles based around contrasting meaning of the same word. The riddles are about as subtle as a rock to the nose, but they will get better. Mine did.<br />Christopher's condition is both the strong point and the weakness of this book. The limits of first-person narration are further constricted when that narrator begins nearly every paragraph with 'And I said &quot;...' or &quot;And then I...&quot; but the patient read will soon get into the rhythm of this speech. Despite several setbacks for the protagonist, things end a little too &quot;happily ever after&quot; in the book.<br />Haddon, the author, was formerly a worker with autistic individuals, and he makes Christopher's closest confident his special needs teacher. I can again speak from experience and say that a great teacher can make a world of difference in such a situation. (God bless you, Ms. Lavallee!)<br />Christopher's parents are treated in an honest way, far from perfect, often and unintentionally setting their child back, but adaptive, willing to learn, and loving.<br />Don't go into this book expecting a Christie-level mystery, or spectacularly imaginative prose. But parents of Asperger's diagnosed children will recognize Haddon's insight at once. And everyone else will perhaps learn to recognize and possibly tolerate if not accept the condition.<br />You'll certainly be better for reading it.trying to be smart-alecky - he is answering in the most honest way he can.<BR>- Christopher does not like jokes.

B000068PQ0|5.0|I saw these guys at Amoeba Records the day the record was released so that influences my view of the record. Since the first time I heard it Wayne Coyne was playing it to me on a CD player. I have seen The Flaming Lips play a few times, twice in support of their great album The Soft Bulletin. Many people would imagine that album couldn't be topped. This is one of the great American bands of the past twenty years. Well, they went a little more concept oriented (Zaireeka) while staying true to their sound (Soft Bulletin) and still bringing something new to the table. One thing you notice is how funky they are. Steven Drozd is a master musician and a great drummer. Everything you could wish for is here and they seem relaxed at the same time. The album has a story where there are robots in the future and Yoshimi ends up fighting the best one. Robots by this time can taste and feel just like humans. The robots are made to take over the planet. There is a lot about perceptions, and what is real, and time.<br />The first song \\"Fight Test\\" could be a song on The Soft Bulletin. The synthesizers ooze and the chorus says \\"It's all a mystery.\\" Their new sound of computer funk comes in on the song \\"One More Robot.\\" The song end in a real beautiful keyboard section. The next song \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1\\" starts off with a great guitar sound. It is sort of a humorous song and could only be with the title. This dissolves into a fight scene which is like \\"Sparks\\" by The Who. There is a lot of screaming on this track. Two more tracks \\"Magicians\\" and \\"Ego Tripping\\" are songs worthy of being included on Soft Bulletin. \\"Are You A Hypnotist\\" is the Lips flirting with their Pink Floyd obsessions. Lucky for us they keep it under four minutes. Nature and summertime are evoked throughout the album. The single \\"Do You Realize?\\" is already a classic. It is a ballad that dwells on mortality (a favorite Coynian obsession). Then it ends with \\"All We Have Is Now\\" and another instrumental. It is a short record which makes a vital impact. The Flaming Lips are already lining up for the awards for this one. Yes technology is evil. We know that. Technology creates soulless robots and makes everyone a voyeur on the world. The Lips stand against this. We don't need a life which is no more than pornography without consequence. We need to feel something authentic and real.<br />(...)ental.

B00008NRI8|1.0|Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are two great actors, and putting them together in a romantic comedy seems like it would make perfect sense. However this was the wrong choice for them. This movie just wasn't very funny, and I really didn't feel any chemisty between the two. I coulden't wait for this movie to be over. All in all, this movie wasted some big time talent.
B0001US62I|5.0|I love horror movies.I really do. every kind from extreme splatter to the mildest chills. Angel Heart is easily one of the spookiest,and very underated. Mickey Rourke is awesome and gives his best ever performance,its fab from start to finish,beautiful soundtrack,and DeNiro as the bad guy,it has everything,a noir feel that slowly changes into satanic horror......PLUS! Lisa gets very naked....... buy it now!
B0000024JA|4.0|1994 was tremendous, as I've said time and time again. I'm here to set the record straight with Method Man's debut album, Tical. One year after coming off of the successful and classic debut Wu-Tang album, Meth was the first to step up to the plate and release the first Wu solo album, to much hype. A lot has been said about this album, that it was weak, average, disappointing, what have you. But the bottom line(which will be addressed in The Last Word) is that this album represents Meth in his prime, representing in a way that he SHOULD'VE represented on his second album. Here's the COMPLETE review, well I'll do my best:<br />Album Highlights: Tical, Biscuits, Bring The Pain, All I Need, What The Blood Clot, Meth vs.Chef(listen as Meth and Rae do battle, just for fun), Release Yo Delf, I Get My Thang In Action, Stimulation, and Mr.Sandman(RZA and Inspektah Deck KILL this track) and Method Man(Remix).<br />Production: Thumbs in the middle, leaning SLIGHTLY towards up. RZA's production gems are Bring The Pain, Meth vs. Chef, What The Blood Clot.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, but slightly.<br />Originality: Thumbs in the middle.<br />The Last Word: Here's the deal. Is the album a CLASSIC? Sadly no, but the songs described in the album highlights section are classics. This album is NOT up there with the likes of Raekwon and GZA's first albums. It's a decent first album from Meth, and it's strong enough for a four star rating. Overall, I recommend this for the fans of the early Wu-Tang, when they were clearly in their primes. However, even with the platinum and award winning success of this album, with a little more planning and effort, this album could've been much better.
B000058983|3.0|After reading all the wildly enthusiastic reviews of this album, I bought it, thinking I must have missed out on an obscure classic the first time around. After listening to it a couple of times, I don't think so.<br />The instrumentation on this record is excellent, and you may want to buy it for that reason alone. But the lyrics are mediocre at best. The songs are not at all memorable or inspiring to me.  After listening to it all the way through, what does it add up to? To me, not a lot.
B00001IVOF|4.0|Mobb Deep can be best described as one of the greatest duos in hip hop history. They BLAZED hip hop in 1995 with the CLASSIC album, The Infamous, and they returned one year later with an album that's just as good as that album is, Hell On Earth. Havoc and Prodigy continued with their trends of hype, rebellious, East Coast gangsta music that would define their sound, and on this album, they did it with gusto, VERY SLIGHTLY even more so than on The Infamous. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: Every song on this album is worth a listen, but the ONLY songs that could've been left off is &quot;Can't Get Enough Of It&quot; and &quot;Get Dealt Wit.&quot;<br />Production: Thumbs way up. Havoc's sound definitely reaches the apex(not its peak) on this release. <br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Check out Prodigy's show-stealing verses on &quot;Nighttime Vultures&quot;, &quot;G.O.D. Pt.III&quot;, and &quot;The Apostle's Warning.&quot;<br />Originality: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards up. Nothing new from the mobb.<br />The Last Word: Let's set the record straight. 1)Is this album better than The Infamous? NO!!! It's a HARD follow up, but not better than the first album. 2)Is this album worthy of 5 stars? Sadly, no, but it's ALMOST there. This album is excellent, as it's Mobb Deep in their true form throughout. You don't get any better than that. Strongly recommended.
B0000AOV85|4.0|In order to get the most out of this DVD, you'll have to watch and listen closely -- some of the most interesting parts are not obvious.  But if you deeply enjoy the album, then you are probably good at picking out such important nuances.  <br />For example, the &quot;bonus&quot; material (tucked away in a separate menu) includes interviews and recordings that are sometimes more captivating than the main documentary.  These include very personal interviews with Roger Waters on growing up, love, insanity, death, and human kindness, as well as equally personal solo acoustic renditions of &quot;Brain Damage&quot; by Waters (&quot;the lunatic song&quot; as he calls it) and &quot;Breathe&quot;, performed by David Gilmour.  Gilmour, along with Rick Wright, provides fascinating musical insight throughout the documentary. Snippets of the performances and interviews are included in the documentary itself, but to get the whole picture, you've really got to watch the bonus scenes.<br />Another reviewer mentioned that while it is fascinating to see some of the behind the scenes work that went into making &quot;Dark Side&quot;, this may ruin the mystique.  This wasn't the case for me.  Perhaps if you've imagined some themes for the album that turn out to be catastrophically different from what Roger was thinking, I could see how you might be disappointed.  But as the interviews evince, the album is about the trials and tribulations of being human.  I don't see how your version of the meaning could diverge very far from this, in the cosmic sense.  Rather, I think any theme you might associate personally with a song is inevitably close to the intended one.  Waters himself seems to oscillate back and forth between various meanings and implications.<br />As far as the meaning of the album goes, this is what I was hoping to learn more about through this documentary.  While it did provide very interesting information through interviews, there was no external commentary.  That is, thedocumentary is a primary source of information, not a secondary one.  There is no narrator to formulate hypotheses, point out themes and draw conclusions.  This is left to the observer, which really is probably a good thing, following the Floyd's lead.  It's just that, if you've listened to (and thought about) &quot;Dark Side&quot; many many times like a lot of us have, and have maybe read one or two interviews with Roger Waters, you won't find much new insight here as far as the &quot;meaning&quot; goes.  I do have to admit, though, that hearing and seeing the band members (especially Waters) explain their thought processes and interactions in making the album certainly added a new dimension to the story.  <br />The most poignant moment came when Dave Gilmour was showing how he 'accidentally' came up with that speedy, rolling synth vamp for &quot;On the Run&quot;, and admitted that &quot;sometimes things just fit together perfectly by accident... and this album was one of those times&quot; (not a direct quote, but close).  This is the sense you get from the documentary, that for whatever reason things just fell into place perfectly.  For example, the original version of &quot;Us and Them&quot; was written years earlier by Richard Wright as a score for a violent mob scene in the movie &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;.  The lyrics by Waters fit naturally with the music, and the music fits gracefully with the rest of the album.<br />One of the earlier reviewers mentioned that this DVD will evoke memories of tailgate parties that &quot;hammered us into a glorious haze before the concert&quot;, and called the documentary &quot;spankin'&quot;.  I don't get this vibe at all.  The concert footage is brief, and usually doesn't include the actual audio (just the album dubbed over).  So even though it will inevitably bring back some fantastic memories, don't expect to hear yourself shouting &quot;smoke dope!&quot; in the background.  (Of course this same reviewer classified Floydas &quot;heavy-&quot; and &quot;heavier-metal rock&quot;, so form your own opinion...)<br />Another reviewer had nothing but glowing praise for this DVD.  While I think it's great, and would buy it again in a heartbeat, it has its flaws.  For one, it seems very formulaic in its presentation: start at the beginning of the album and go through each song with interviews and video footage on top (fade when necessary).  This isn't surprising since it is just one in a series of &quot;Classic Albums&quot; DVDs.  (In fact, the intro to the DVD isn't even specific to Pink Floyd -- it's a mishmash of rock n' roll sounds and pictures of floating guitars.)  Lastly, as I mentioned before, there are no astounding revelations in the interviews or commentary about the meaning behind the album.  You are still basically left to form your own opinions on what the lyrics 'really mean' and what this all has to do with insanity, human suffering, and monetary gain.  Anyone who has read an interview with Roger Waters will already be acquainted with his view on these themes.<br />This is a good documentary that I recommend to all Pink Floyd fans.  While it has some shining moments, you have to look carefully for them and some might be disappointed by the matter-of-fact presentation by the band members.  If you can retain your wonder and imagination, you'll be rewarded with a new appreciation for the thoughtfulness and childlike spontaneity that synergized to make the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; the greatest album ever created.
0156027321|5.0|Until recently I'd been reluctant to read LIFE of PI. Somehow I got the idea that the zoo animals aboard the life boat were anthropomorphized. Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br />Richard Parker, the tiger, is one of the most vivid animal characters I have ever read about. He just jumps off the page.<br /> Life of Pi is divided into two segments, before the shipwreck and after. The first part deals with Pi's life in India with his zoo keeper father and his mother and brother. We learn a lot about zoo animals and how well they adapt to their pseudo environment, and this leads right into Pi's religion. He belongs to three of them: Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He sees merits in all three. Martel hints at similarities between the holy men and the animals. They all mark their territory and when it is discovered that Pi belongs to three churches he is ostracized by all three, because YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE! There are humorous moments in this segment such as when we find out Pi is named after a swimming pool and that his nickname was &quot;Pissing,&quot; short for Piscine.<br /> If you're bored by the first half, hang in there, the second half will knock you over. It is simply riveting, and Pi is one of the smartest sixteen-year-olds I have ever encountered. His duel with Richard Parker is more entertaining than Siegfried and Roy.<br /> As you're reading, you will encounter scenes that strain credulity, but don't get too cocky. Yann Martel has anticipated your disbelief. The ending is masterful and leaves you with something to think about after you're finished reading, as all really good books do. It's also very funny. The Japanese interviewers are a hoot.
080726203X|5.0|The Giver was a good book because it was so weird. The setting was very diffrent from other books with the common theme.It has some what a unpredictable climax because of the characters feelings during the plot.Also it teaches a life lesson because behind all those words, it teaches that the future is not good to know but,that you have to wait and see.
B000002MJC|5.0|This album marked the end of an era for Depeche Mode.  Every album up to this one was primarily synthesizers, keyboards, and a drum machine.  This marked the beginning of the band using live percussion and they took the focus away from the keyboard.  Although the keyboard is still extremely important in this album, they tried to focus on guitar use more than ever before.  The songs are different from the band's earlier sound, but still great:<br />1. I Feel You - The song that starts the album was also the first single from the album.  It's a fairly repetative song with a great beat that is fun to move to.<br />2. Walking in My Shoes - The second song on the album and the second single from it.  This, in my opinion, is one of the best songs on the album.  It has a great chorus line and the lyrics are wonderful.<br />3. Condemnation - The third single from the album, I find it to be, musically, the weakest song on the album.  I'm sure I'll get shunned for saying this, but it is how I feel.<br />4. Mercy In You - My favorite song on this album, hands down.  This song is wonderful.  The rhythm and beat are great, the lyrics are great...  Did I mention it is great?<br />5. Judas - A very powerful song, as the name would imply.  Martin does the singing on this one to bring a very eerie sound of betrayal.  Love the stuff!!!<br />6. In Your Room - Another single from the album.  David's vocals on this echo in your head for hours.  This song is great.  It is the perfect center piece for the album.<br />7. Get Right With Me - A solid piece of music.  This song perfectly fits after &quot;In Your Room&quot; as a transition into &quot;Rush&quot;.<br />8. Rush - This is tied for second with &quot;Walking In My Shoes&quot; on my favorite list for this album.  David's power vocals bring this song an energy you have experience to understand.<br />9. One Caress - Like Condemnation, I'm not too fond of this track.  It fits real well, but it doesn't move me the way some of the other songs do.<br />10. Higher Love - Depeche Mode has always had a way of ending albums perfectly and &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; is no exception.  Higher Love is the perfect way to conclude this album.  Powerful musically, this brings a wonderful album to a great conclusion.<br />&quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; shocked me when it first came out.  I was expecting another &quot;Violator&quot;.  At first I didn't like it, but over the years it has grown on me.  It's worth the money.ongs do.<br />10.

B0000025DV|5.0|no, i'm not just saying that every song on here is good enough to have been a hit, i'm saying every song on here _is_ a hit (most are small hits, but still hits!).  i just got this album the other day, and i know _all_ of these songs (i must have heard em on the radio over the years).<br />the album starts out with &quot;turn to stone&quot;, which is the biggest hit on here, and a great upbeat song, with a mindblowingly phenomenal bridge.<br />&quot;it's over&quot; is probably my least favorite song on the album, but it's still good..<br />i absolutely love &quot;sweet talkin woman&quot;, with all the energized background singers in the chorus (and even the verses)!  but my absolute favorite part of this song (and the album) is the wonderful pre-chorus.. &quot;i don't know what i'm gonna do, i gotta get back to you!&quot;  you _have_ to sing along.  i tried not singing along once; it didn't work<br />oh, and in &quot;across the border&quot;, the best part is the &quot;ooh&quot;s; they're the only part of the song i sing along with (i don't quite know all the lyrics; but i totally got the ooh's down perfectly)<br />&quot;night in the city&quot;.. driving you insane!  man, these guys know how to write some fun songs.  what do think about the crazy bridge?  i don't think any band could have pulled that off except elo.<br />oh man, &quot;starlight&quot; is just perfect!<br />from the mellow &quot;starlight&quot; to the totally upbeat &quot;jungle&quot;!  the humming is my favorite.<br />a lovely instrumental then leads to one of my favorite songs on the album, the beautiful &quot;steppin out&quot;.<br />and then another great instrumental leading into the powerful &quot;standing in the rain&quot;<br />which leads right into &quot;big wheels turning&quot;.. man, another great song.  i absolutely love the chorus and all the orchestra<br />&quot;summer and lightning&quot;, another wonderful song.  i think i like the chorus in this one even better than the last one<br />&quot;mr blue sky&quot;.  &quot;it's so beautiful today, hey hey hey!&quot;  come on, i don't have to say anything.  everyone knows this song is the best<br />&quot;sweet is the night&quot;.  i can't take it; all these songs are too good.  it's the verses that totally make this song great.. and all that awesome orchestra in the background<br />&quot;the whale&quot; isn't just some filler instrumental; it's just some music that was so perfect it didn't need any words.  &quot;fire on high&quot; was the energetic masterpiece instrumental of elo, and this is the mellow masterpiece instrumental<br />alright, &quot;birmingham blues&quot;.  good stuff; what else can i say?  and the handclaps are great (:<br />and it ends with one of the greatest songs on the album (yeah, i know they're all great, but this one is really something), &quot;world wide hero&quot;.  yep, all those great songs you just heard, and they still end up saving the best one for last.<br />please get this album.
0440237688|1.0|When I read this book for the Children's Lit class that I teach, I was horrified. Not only is the story ineptly constructed, but it also portrays the blatant manipulation of the child protagonist by the very person who's supposed to train him for his designated job.  I had had high hopes for this book when I started reading it, but clearly Lois Lowry needs some instruction in how to create a functional alternate worldview. Her utopian world makes little sense because she fails to explore it in enough depth. I think if the book had been another 100 pages or so, it might have been worth the reading, but as it is, I'm horrified by both the popularity of the novel and by the uncritical manner in which it is approached by teachers and students alike.

B00005JMKI|5.0|Suppose, just suppose the GOD OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, wrathful and condeming, sends or forces His son (or in this case his daugther) to earth; anytown, anyplace aka Dogville. Just how different would the Passion of Christ have been without a Loving Father as a mentor?  His daughter, Grace (appropriately named), comes to Dogville and at first is received warmly, and then by degree subtely and then harshly hated and even abused. Her cross to bear, as it were, is a dog collar teathered to an iron flywheel that she drags through the streets of this town. She is finally betrayed, and actually offered up to die at the hands of her Father.  Now the allegory gets interesting. Her Father tells her she is arrogant; she thinks so much of herself that arrogant she thinks she has the right to forgive such hateful people, and she has. Never once does she condemn anyone. She always forgives the people of Dogville, regardless of what they did to her (listen carefully to the last scene in her Father's car). Her Father suggests a harsh punishment for the people of Dogville, and after some consideration she agrees.  Actually in affect she says F$@% 'em, Screw up all.  And the red flames of Hell consume the town. BRILLANTLY ACTED, MARVELOUS INSIGHTFUL SCRIPT, WONDERFUL DIRECTOR. Once of the best movies I've seen in many year.
B00000J7SS|3.0|This cd isn't terrible, by all means.  However there really isn't a &quot;head&quot; nor an actually melodie stated in many songs. Only shreds of ideas.  Its unorganized and sounds disoriented. Although this seems to be the effect attempted, Frank Zappa and other rock greats had &quot;fusion,&quot; as they call it, mastered much greater than this. I was never into the 'lets freak out the world&quot; music of the 60s when an artist is trying to sound wierd over good(not to say i don't like a little psychadelic beauty, hence my name).  If you want real Miles, go buy Kind of Blue or the Birth of the cool.
1592400876|4.0|This book is a very fun and quick read. It briefs you on the major punctuation rules, and spends the rest of the time telling you funny antedotes. If you're serious about learning punctuation, there are better textbooks out there. But I doubt any of those textbooks would be half as fun to read as \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves.\\" While this book is fun in that it takes a gimmick (in this case, bad punctuation) and runs with it, what elevates it from other one-joke books is the author's genuine love for the English language and her earnest plea for people to give it more respect.<br />The bad punctuation examples are funny, and thankfully, not overdone. The historical orgins are interesting to read about. The prose is never dry. The author maintains a none-so-serious tone throughout the book, choosing the most colorful quotes and hilarious excerpts about punctuation from various literary sources to illustrate her points. Those passages are absolutely fascinating. They're definitely my favorite parts of the book. I just never knew so many brilliant minds have given so much thought to punctuation.<br />There are differences between British and American styles of punctuation, and the author makes a note of it in the Preface, and whenever necessary, such as the section concerning quotation marks. As an American, I take it as a compliment that the author and Gotham Books decided against americanizing this book, and gave the American public the benefit of the doubt that they would be smart enough to note the differences, especially when it's so clearly pointed out in the book.<br />Some people think this book is trying to stifle creativity and make everyone write like stuck-up British people. I disagree. There's a huge difference between forcing Warner Brothers to properly punctuate the title \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" and forcing Peter Carey to properly punctuate the entire \\"True History of the Kelly Gang,\\" and the author notes that distinction loud and clear.(...) It's merely asking people to have more respect for the English language in everyday life; to learn its rules, and apply it correctly. Exceptions to the rules can and have been made in literature: this book lists many instances in punctuation where the rule is a judgement call, so each writer can have his/her own style of punctuation; and as the author admits - language evolves, and many great writers have broken or tried to change the rules. I think it's a very reasonable thing to ask everyday people and aspiring writers alike to have more respect for the English language before they attempt to either abuse it through ignorance or change it for creative reasons.<br />Last but not least, and I have to get this off my chest, contrary to what the earlier reviewer Olly Buxton said, the title of this book does work as a joke when you write it down, precisely because of bad punctuation. I can't believe I'm spelling this out for him, but then, he thinks \\"ones\\" is more correct to use as a possessive than \\"one's\\" (hint: \\"one\\" is not a pronoun, so use the apostrophe). \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves,\\" when told through writing, relies on the poorly-placed comma to be taken the wrong way. With the comma, \\"shoots\\" and \\"leaves\\" work as verbs. Without the comma, \\"shoots\\" and \\"leaves\\" become nouns. Of course, as a spoken (pun) joke, the comma doesn't matter. But in writing, it very much does. <br />In this case, the joke's about the importance of punctuation, Olly. Not shagging.
B00006879E|3.0|I bought this cd because I thought the group had an interesting sound.  It's a good cd but it has it's faults.  Some of the songs are great, but I must admit that a lot of them sound really similar to each other.  There were a couple of time when I first heard the cd that I thought it was repeating a song I had already listened to.  Overall though the cd is above average.  I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could.
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown uses a tried and true formula in the thriller genre, with a crunchy twist - the heroic protagonist(s) are expert in the field most pertinent to their dilemma. He writes a well paced, engaging plot, and characters with somewhat more than usual depth for the type. His presentation of his central subject seems well informed, and he appears to be teaching while entertaining.<br />Deception Point has some holes in the initial premise which require that you suspend your disbelief early, but once accepted, do not interfere with an exciting ride. Literature it is not, but you shouldn't be reading it if literature is what you are after. For escapist reading that draws you in and holds you with the added bonus of making you wonder about subjects outside the realm of weapons and seductions and betrayals (although, of course, you get those too,) there are few today who write more adroitly.

0783240236|4.0|I thought The Birds was a really good movie. I liked how they didn't use music when the birds started attacking them.The end of the movie was very unsatisfying. I wish the birds would have chased them at the end. The actors were really good. Melanie (Tippi Hendren) was good at acting the part of being attacked. The other actors weren't all that good. The little girl didn't do a good job at being scared and worried. Alfred Hitchcock is a good writer. I think this is one of his really good books.The part when the crows were standing on the jungle gym was funny. Mitch (Rod Taylor) did a good job at playing his part. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B000001FRY|5.0|Boy, U2's first studio album is not just good, it's promising, uplifting, inspiring and cutting &quot;Edge.&quot;  Indeed, this album established that anthemic sound that has been the framework for most U2 songs since: the shimmering effects-laden guitar, Bono's rampant, moving vocals, and Adam's and Larry's driving rhythm section.  This is U2 in their purest form.  Steve Lillywhite's production is excellent and so is the raw sound of the band.  Highlights on the album are: &quot;I Will Follow,&quot; &quot;Out of Control,&quot; &quot;A Day Without Me,&quot; and &quot;Twilight.&quot;  The album deals with many issues, predominantly the difficulty of turning from a boy into a man.  &quot;In the shadow, boy meets man,&quot; Bono sings on &quot;Twilight.&quot;  Indeed this album is a spectacular display of what U2 would go on to become - one of the greatest rock bands ever.  It is a must have for any U2 fan, or anyone still sitting on the fence.  After hearing &quot;Boy,&quot; it's no wonder to me that U2 have gone on to become the greatest anthemic rock band in history.  Leave your computer, go to the store, and buy it.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Couldn't both versions of the movie been included on the Redux DVD? Sometimes it's just too much to commit to the Redux version. That's not to suggest that the replaced scenes detract in any way from the sublime beauty of the film, but neither does it add meaning, so much as to make it preferable to the original. One of the most outstanding parts of the movie is the sound, which contributes so much to the eerie quality. Also, these are classic film characters.... Duvall, Hopper. The setting of the movie is deceptive since it 's possible to not enjoy the genre of war movies and still love &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; What it's really about is the human mind. Coppola takes the viewer into a dreamlike state to evoke how the mind might cope with prolonged trauma. War movies are chararcterized by long battle scenes, the terror of bloody battlefields and the camaraderie among soldiers, but what stands out here is the journey and the mystery. The majority of the picture is Sheen's character's journey to find Colonel Kurtz. All we see through the first three quarters is noir type photographs. So, though Brando has little comparable screen time, the build-up of &quot;who is Colonel Kurtz?&quot; gives him epic stature. For a first viewing or a DVD collection, the original is probably best, but for a true fan, Redux too is a must see.
0385510438|1.0|Don't waste your money buying this book.  It plodded along with no plot that I could find.  Some reviews made it sound like the old John Grisham but this book failed miserably.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Inormally hate watching anything more than twice. I get irritated with the tidbits that can make a movie completely awful to watch the second time around. However, with FMJ, it really does get better the more times you watch it! Watch those recruit's facial expressions carefully during the first part of the movie. It's so genuine with the smirks that are given off when the DI yelps his mouth off with hilarious antics. There's no doubt Kubrick filmed the scenes over and over again until they were &quot;just right&quot; -- something that totally lacks in modern day movies. R. Lee Ermey of the History Channel's &quot;Mail Call&quot; shines as the evil drill instructor.  Mathew Modine is truly great as &quot;Private Joker&quot;  Full Metal Jacket is movie that captures the war from boot camp to the 'Nam and feelings around it so perfectly that nothing can touch it.  I was very impressed by how this movie portrayled how brutal boot camp is mentally and physically. I'm sure they don't train people like that anymore, but it was interesting to see how it was done around the Vietnam War.  Kubrick is an artist and no one in the industry can even approach his level of skill. This has brutal honesty and passive aggressiveness all in the same package. And it is also the most quotable movie ever.

0440180295|5.0|I don't feel that I am making an overstatement when I say that this is the best novel ever written. The theme is one of man's insignificance in space and time. All we can do as humans is hold onto the present as it is. We will never change that the past has happened, that the present is happening and that the future will always happen. I first read this book in high school and then several years later when I was in college and it is amazing how the book seems to grow with you as your understanding and world views change. Vonnegut takes the reader on a roller coaster ride through the life of his character Billy Pilgram and jumps from one peak to the next valley of the various stages of his life without ever losing his main story line. A very hard book to put down that only gets better each time you read it.

B000059XUO|5.0|Eric Draven was killed on Devil's Night; that night before Halloween when evil arsonists run amok, causing fear and destruction throughout the city. His fiancee, Shelly Webster, was raped and murdered in front of him on that same night. It is said that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead, ... but, sometimes, the crow will bring them back for revenge! That's just what happens in 1994's comic book-based \\"The Crow,\\" a dark, beautifully gothic tale of violence, revenge, and justice.<br />One year after his death, Eric (Brandon Lee, in his tragic, final role) returns as an unstoppable force of vengeance, with a supernatural Crow as his guide to those whom he must destroy. One by one, Eric takes out the scumbags that took his life and love, Shelly. As his work becomes more challenging, he enlists the aid of kindhearted Police Sergeant Albrecht, played by beloved Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson.  Together, they protect a young girl named Sarah, as Eric goes on with his vigilante executions, eventually leading him to a much bigger source of evil.<br />  The Crow is a masterpiece of modern film. The first in the now popular style of dark, gothic tales of supernatural Urban warfare. The tale is cold and unforgiving, yet equally touching, and straight from the heart of creator James O'Barr. The film is dark and graphic, and perfectly matched to the story it tells. The acting is superb, the writing poetic, and the attention to detail baffling. This is a film that is truly an event to watch, as simple as the story may be. The DVD is loaded with extras that really give you insight into the depth the film-makers went to bring The Crow to the big screen. You'll also get a keen understanding of the comic and its creator, or at least, as best as you can without reading the comic yourself.<br />  Tragically, Brandon Lee was shot and killed while filming this Masterpiece of a movie in a somewhat suspicious \\"accident.\\" Who knows what wonderful films we would have today, had that accident not occurred. As it stands however, this film will go on as Brandon's gift for generations and generations to come.would have today, had that accident not occurred.

0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is on of my favorite movies of all time and remains the benchmark by which I compare all other movies. Some movies, very few, are technically better. Some may hold a plot better but none combine the two aspects as effectively. Every character is meticulously developed and the camera work belongs only to Mr. Scorcese. Women may not love this movie as much as men however, Ms. Bracco has given us a strong and important female lead. If you love movies and haven't seen this movie... see it.  This is a great movie, telling of Henry Hill's 30 years in organized crime.  I get teared-up thinking about how amazing some of the scenes in this film are: Joe Pesci asks if Ray Liotta thinks he's funny, Ray drives around in a drug haze, Ray and his girlfriend walk through the kitchen at a nightclub, Ray pistol whips his girlfriend's date who was &quot;all hands,&quot; Ray shows off his new TV, Ray's wife tries to break down the door of his girlfriend's house, Robert DeNiro receives upsetting news on a payphone. However, a great movie like this deserves at least a better DVD. I am hoping that Warner Bros. will release another version with an anamorphic transfer and - oh yeah - the movie all on one side of the disc.  However, the movie is so good, it overcomes the DVD's shortcomings.
B000002IGP|5.0|This CD rocks! The production is mesmerizing. My Favorites are &quot;Your Direction&quot; and &quot;Communication&quot; and the last one I think it is called &quot;Scence of the Crime&quot;.<br />&quot;Your Direction&quot; starts with a single over driven guitar a-chugga-chugga chow, a- chugga chugga chow, then the rythm guitar cranks up, a chugga chugga chow, a- chugga chugga chow<br />it cranks. I cannot listen to this one while driving. I must pull over while other concerned drivers pass witnessing my epileptic fist pump and head bang. I usually listen to it next to a homeless camp in golden gate park. The winos really like this one (hey Jeb,its that ratt guy again!); a definite get outta yer' cardboard box and jamm'er.<br />&quot;Communication&quot; is different. Though formulated like most hard rock, &quot;Communication&quot; is a whole different dimension. Still excellent guitar but the playing is so tight and unified. Superb. Definitely a cut above other rock bands efforts. Vocals are tight and superb.<br /><br />&quot;Scene&quot; Well the first 2.5 minutes of this song are head and shoulders above any attemps at rock to date (I mean anything). The intro is purely theatrics. A solo guitar repeating a highly over-driven diminishing scale in the upper registers, repeating again and again followed by some kind of timing thing with the drummer, No bass no vocals just the guitar driving high above the tom drum separate then, guitar rolling into another octave they combine and then the vocals &quot;I wanna rock........ but you your there to ro-oll.... I came by your house but you you were'nt alone..............&quot;<br />You must buy this album. I left a copy of this in my girlfriends car, all she listens to is crappy KOIT soft rock less talk, she picked me up one day and she was totally rocking out to this CD. She won't give it back! I'm a  little scared.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Ever since I got this soundtrack, I've been pretty much listening to it as much as I can. The mood of the soundtrack goes along with the film very well, and I really enjoy it. Sadly, some songs I enjoy are not on the soundtrack (Such as 'From Man To Man' by Ennio Morricone and 'Nobody But Me' by The Human Beinz). But thankfully I downloaded them and put them onto my MD Player.<br />If you are a fan of Tarantino soundtracks, you may enjoy this one. I enjoy most of the soundtrack, but there are some songs I do not care for.<br />Favorite Tracks:<BR>* The Grand Duel-(Parte Prima) (Luis Bacalov)<BR>* Nobody But Me* (The Human Beinz)<BR>* Run Fay Run (Isaac Hayes)<BR>* The Lonely Shepard (Zamfir)<BR>* Green Hornet (Al Hirt)<BR>* Battle Without Honor Or Humanity (Tomoyasu Hotei)<BR>* The Flower Of Carnage (Meiko Kaji)<BR>* Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood (Santa Esmeralda)<BR>* Twisted Nerve (Bernard Hermann)<BR>* Seven Notes In Black* (Vince Tempera)<BR>* Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) (Nancy Sinatra)<BR>* Long Day Of Vengeance* (Armando Travajoli)<BR>* From Man To Man (Death Rides A Horse)* (Ennio Morricone)<BR>* Urami-Bushi* (Meiko Kaji)<br />Least Favorite Tracks:<BR>* Ode To O-Ren (Annoying rap song by The RZA)<BR>* Any SFX Track (Hidden)<BR>* Queen Of The Crime Council (Dialogue Snippet)<BR>* You're My Wicked Life (Dialogue Snippet)<BR>* Woo Hoo (The 5.6.7.8.'s) (Sounds better in the film)<BR>* Ironside (Quincy Jones) (Doesn't fit the mood of the soundtrack IMO)<br />* Means Not On OST<br />Overall, a nice collection of songs. if you enjoy the film, I bet you will also enjoy the soundtrack.

B0000025BL|5.0|Quite simple the best album in the world ever, this album is imposible to overrate. It is a true master piece and as an album i believe it beats even the Sex Pistols \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" album (released in the same year, damn to be alive in 1977) to the no 1 all time greatest album.<br />1) Bat out of Hell - seriously need i say more, kill for this song<BR>2) You Took the Words Right out of my Mouth - almost on a par with Bat out of Hell, this is a great song, if you dont like it consider not listening to music as this will proberbly suit your tastes better.<BR>3) Heaven Can Wait - The weakest song on the album. Its an okay song but by far the weakest, its neither an out right operatic number or a rocking out tune so it falls flat (although only by comparison with the other songs on this album.<BR>4) All Revved Up with no Place to go - This is a good song, your basic streight foward Meat Loaf rocking song.<BR>5) Two out of Three Aint Bad - Not bad although suffers similar problems to Heaven Can Wait. On the other hand is still better than 95% of other music around.<BR>6) Paradise by the Dash Board Light - some people have descibed this as the master piece of the album, whilst this is not true (look at Bat out of Hell for a true classic) it is cetainly an amazing song - especially when you listen to the metaphrical ball game mid way through the song<BR>7) For Cryin out Loud - it is songs like this that give Meat Loaf his reputation for big songs...it manages to combine opera, big band and sheer awsome rock ballad to produce one of the gems of this album.<br />In summary (in case you cant pick up on the opinion of the piece) i seriosly cannot recommed this album higly enough, i actually feel bad that i havent bothered to wirte bad reviews of other albums simply to make this look good thorugh comparison. This record should be compulsory listening for anyone who claims to have anything in the way of musical taste of knowledge

Simply because it is one of his very bests if not the best one.<br />If you haven't seen it, go and watch it NOW,you won't regret it!<br />I don't want to talk too much about the story, you can read it elsewhere if you wish.<br />The atmosphere of the film is excellent, end the ending (last 20 minutes) makes you breathless. Believe me, it's THAT good.<br />This movie is simply timeless and shows how a perfect horror film can be done.
B0001Z363W|5.0|this cd is a bit different for fans of the Society. this disc is killer in its own respect. it is mellow, slow, but yet it still has its sense of charm to it. to me, it reminds me of the 2nd disc of alcohol fewled. every tune has its own special blend, and as the review before said, i prefer the sonic brew of zakk, but ANYTHING zakk does is extraordinary....this included. BLEED BLACK LABEL FOREVER
0790729385|2.0|This is one of the most overrated horror films (beside Night Of The Living Dead).<BR>It's dull and silly, and not scary at all.<BR>If you want to see real essential horror films, then watch The Evil Dead, Phantasm, Basket Case or The Thing, they are MUCH BETTER than this junk.

B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is great. Theres not really much to say really that I could put this in my own words. This is an amazing band, the best band ever. Courtney killed Kurt Cobain which sucks because how people say it was suicide, it wasn't. Don't think its suicide. Justiceforkurt.com, that website will tell you all about the suspicion murder of kurt cobain. Ten years without kurt, I feel vulgar, If it helps this album was ranked #2 on the 22 greatest albums of all time. which it should have ranked #1 instead. But this album doesn't need that because I know its the best album ever. It truely is.
B000002KCV|5.0|There are people who would contend that `Comes a Time' is Neil Young's finest work. While it is truly a beautiful collection of songs, what it lacks is a demonstration of Neil's versatility, something clearly established on works such as `After the Goldrush' or `Rust Never Sleeps'.  Neil can rock, and Neil can psychedelicize (a word coined by The Chamber's Brothers, doncha' know...), but that's not what `Comes a Time' is about. `Comes a Time' is a country/folk album cast from the same mold as his best selling album, `Harvest', but superior to `Harvest in two respects:<br />1) Young is more mature, as a composer, as a musician, and most importantly, as a person.  He is for instance, able to bring in the 'Gone With the Wind Orchestra' without allowing his music to be overwhelmed by it, as `There's a World' and `A Man Needs a Maid' were on `Harvest'.  There are many subtle nuances in the musicianship that lend depth and texture to many of the compositions, beginning with the very first waves of his pick over his guitar strings on the opening cut, `Goin' Back'.  And lyrics such as \\"In my new life I'm travelin' light, eyes wide open for the next move, I can't go wrong till I get right, but I'm not falling back in the same groove\\" from `Already One' show that Neil had exorcised many of the demons that had tormented him since the death of friend Danny Whitten, and his divorce from actress Carrie Snodgress earlier in the decade.<br />2) Many of the songs on this album are as fragile and delicate as a pile of pick-up sticks, but Young is able to convey strength and conviction through their gentleness.  He's killing us softly with his song.  While `Harvest' will most likely bring you down, `Comes a Time' will lift you up.<br />The only criticism I would have of the disc involves two songs: `Lotta Love' and `Motorcycle Mama'.  The problem with `Lotta Love' is that it has been so darned overplayed.  The late Nicolette Larson, who contributes fine `countryfied' background vocalsto this album, and leads on `Motorcycle Mama', turned her own version of  `Lotta Love' into a number 8 hit in 1978.  It also is included on Neil's `Live Rust' album and the `Rust Never Sleeps' film.  That's a lotta la la la la la la la la la's to absorb.<br />`Motorcycle Mama', on the other hand, is more of a gritty blues tune that feels out of place here. Unlike the inclusion of `Alabama' to beef up the low-key tone of `Harvest', this album is shimmering enough not to require a wake-up call on track nine.  It's a good song, and despite it's `Harley-ness', does manage to feel `country-ish'.  Nevertheless, Neil should have left Old Black in its case this time.<br />It's instructive that my criticisms of the album involve good songs.  There simply is not one loser in the entire collection, and tunes such as `Goin' Back', `Already One', `Field of Opportunity' and the title track are among Neil's finest.  Since you've already demonstrated your interest in Young's work by opening to this page, let me tell you that you can't go wrong in purchasing this disc.  It can certainly be the starting point in putting together a Neil Young collection, and I guarantee that if it is your first, it will not be your last.  Then again, who hasn't owned a Neil Young album at some time in their life?  If you haven't, beware that there comes a time...
B00003CXXS|3.0|What was Spieldberg thinking when he handed off the awesome Jurassic Park series to Joe Johnston.  This film ultimately could've been better had Steven been back in the director seat.  The effects were iffy.  Whoever had the idea of replacing the T-Rex in the film should be kicked out of Hollywood.  The Rex should have stayed.  Another thing, are the Velociraptors getting Extreme Makeovers during each of the film releases, I mean, who's idea was the featheres. The acting was so so, on the exception of Neil, Leoni, and that little kid. Macy let me down on his performance. This film was a little bit of a thrill ride, but the film lacked the realism, the sense of danger, and the tenstion that the other two films had.  I dred Jurassic Park IV even though Spieldberg is directing again.  Hopefully he can dig himself out of the rut that Johnston put him in.
B000002A46|5.0|I bought this CD the day it was released and every year when I put up my tree, decorate, and even open my presents on Christmas morning this CD is on...Her originals songs are awesome. Her remakes of Traditional Christmas songs are simply amazing with a little Mariah trademark. Especially her remake of &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; Is simply breath-taking! She definately shows with this album that she can do anything!
B00005JLYW|2.0|The wonderful remake of Charlie's Angels was phenomenal.  They took a touch of unreal things and blended it with a beautiful high tech secret world.  The sequel however, is skimpy outfits, bad acting, fake effects, and nothing much else.  Firstly I would like to tell you why I give it two.  Demi Moore looked great!  She never delivered an evil role so beautifully and didn't deserve her Worst Supporting Acress Razzie.  Drew Barrymore stayed deep and serious in her character, but Lucy and Cameron came out with stupid ditzy performances that didn't make them as smart as they were in the original film.  One thing that could've made the movie better would've been less stupid effects, and a more touch of reality like we saw in the first installment.  Not even B worthy, I give this film a D-
B000002MUN|5.0|What a great line.  I have always liked this album but I realized its multi-generational appeal when my teenagers pulled it out of their pile of cds on a road trip a few years ago.  Petty is cool, no matter your age.  This collection of songs runs the gamut of styles, from rowdy rock and roll to quiet ballads.  The lyrics may qualify as his best and most personal ever.  A terrific album, one that he has yet to top since.
0380789035|5.0|I would just like to say that Al Kitching's review is the most inane piece of tripe I have ever read.  That is all.
B00008PC2O|5.0|When Arnold Schwartzenegger was the king of all things action this was his biggest movie.  He reprised his role as The Terminator, he played him more good guy friendly but just as tough.  Sarah Conner's character went psychotic, and her little boy grows up to be a thug.  The movie was full of action and thrills and the film ended sad.  It was all and more I expected from Cameron.  One of his better films.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|The best thing about this DVD, aside from the great music, is that it is obvious that everyone is having a great time on stage. There is so much good about it, you just really have to see and hear it for yourself.
B00006879E|5.0|There isn't a single song on this CD that I don't like.  I listen to this cd every day and would recommend it to anyone.  It appeals to a wide variety of people, the lyrics are interesting and thought provoking.  &quot;The Sun&quot; is probably the best song that I've ever heard.  I love it.
B0001I55OC|2.0|What is wrong with the people who made this movie? Why are the characters in it so gosh darn stupid? You know a movie is bad when you want to kill the protagonist more than the on screen villian.<br />  First, lets dispense with the plot. Time travel stories can be tricky, but not this one. &quot;We cannot disturb the past&quot; one on-screen village idiot spouts, but then they proceed to go back into the past and start killing people, setting fires and generally alter history - WITH NO ILL EFFECTS!! <br />  You don't want to be seen or heard on this rescue mission? Fine, quickly gather a small team of mercs and historians with some military training (believe me, they exist) who can speak  English with no accents, and can speak some French or at least understand it; arm them with tranquilizer guns, modern repelling gear, night vision and knockout gas and have them operate at night only. Did ANY of this happen? Of course not.<br />Let's not forget another one of my favorite stupid stupid plotlines: sending a Frenchman, who has no common sense and poor vision, back into the past...behind the battle lines of the English! &quot;We need him!!&quot; the lead character screamed. Can you guess what happened to him?<br />   The lead character was another problem: making googly-eyes at the female archeologist during swordfights, whining and generally acting the fool. My favorite person, however, in this &quot;Supertrain&quot; of a movie was the mercenary guy who brought a grenade back to the past. Guess when he pulled the pin? YOU GOT IT: after he was in a fight, after being transported back to the present, thereby blowing up the time travel lab to create more &quot;dramatic tension&quot;...UGH!!<br />Bad, bad,bad,bad movie.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 are finally going to be released on DVD. Everyone is acting like little sissies becuase these are the special editions? When I watch the original versions I can't tell much difference between them and the special editions, except for a cleaner picture and a tiny bit of new music. If you don't like it then stick to your old crappy VHS movies. I've been waiting for these to come out on DVD for years and i'll be happy to buy this nice set. And anyone that doesn't like episodes 1 and 2 need to be shot. Episodes 1 and 2 were excellent movies, the best movies of any kind to come out in the last 10 years. Stop your whining little b@tches and get a life.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Yes, I have seen many Sir Run Run Shaw kung-fu flicks too. But I would never have thought to rip off that genre to the degree that Tarentino did in this movie. He even used the same music in spots! But if you are going to rip off a genre, this is a good one to pick. <br />  Fortunately, Tarentino manages to keep this film from turning into another &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; (a snoozefest to end all snoozefests) by adding alot of bloody shootouts, swordfights and knife fights that are well choreographed. Tarentino even managed to throw in some Anime segments as well. I was amazed that two of the biggest acting downers in history are in this movie (Uma &quot;Avengers&quot; Thurman and Lucy &quot;Any-Movie-That-She-Was-In&quot; Lui) but it was still entertaining! Go figure. <br />  Should you buy this? I don't know, I would rent it first if I was you. Some poor fools actually paid serious bucks to see this at the theatres - I would'nt go that far.
B00004X01U|4.0|Music was, I think, the beginning of Madonna's new, softer image. Most of the tracks are moving, emotional love songs and there is a lot to love on this album. Comparing Music to American Life, all you have to do is look at the colors on the album cover.  American Life is serious, dramatic, and sad. Music is more uplifting, wistful, and definitely more colorful. However, Music lacked the musical cohesion and flow that made American Life such a brilliant concept album.<br />Music is more of a pop album, with catchy beats and lyrics, often the sound and melody takes precedence of deep, thought-provoking ideas, although there are definitely some great, haunting, classic Madonna songs to be found on this album.  First, there are a series of great, great acoustic and techno-inspired ballads.  There is the guitar-driven beauty of Gone, which is an anthem for anyone who had nothing to lose in life. Also I Deserve It is a very pretty love song about Madonna's feelings for her husband. Don't Tell Me, Music, and What it Feels Like For a Girl were all vastly overrated and overplayed upon release, but are solid songs. Nobody's Perfect and Paradise are the gems and masterpieces of this album, and make Music something I could never live with out.
B00005JMEW|5.0|You'll notice 99% of votes here are either 1 star or 5 stars. There really isn't any &quot;in between&quot; or halfheartedness possible here. After all, it's a Tarantino movie. I find his movies usually have that &quot;love it or hate it&quot; effect.<br />I was in total awe after seeing this movie. Probably the best movie since 1998's The Big Lebowski.<br />The storyline is dead simple... But Tarantino manages to inject so many style-elements into the movie that it keeps you at the edge of your seat. 70s Hong Kong kunfu flicks, Japanese manga, graphic displays of violence, wry humor of the blackest kind and a soundtrack that at times seems so inappropriate it becomes appropriate. As usual for Mr T: blood flows like water down a mountain stream and the characters are quirky, but somehow likeable.<br />And still it's unlike Quentin's last couple of movies. It's more like Tarantino to the tenth degree.<br />Vol. 2 just came out in the theaters here and I can't wait to see it. See how this bloodbath of vengeance continues.<br />Definitely not for everybody, but those who can see through the violence and gore, will find what a true cinematic gem this movie is.<br />Good to see Mr T hasn't lost any of his genius.<br />So in short...<br />If you hate Tarantino's other movies, please steer clear of this one. If you love his other flicks, run (don't walk) and get this DVD today!<br />Period.
B00008BRBG|4.0|The Police were never a pure punk group. But, then again, they didn't fit into any genre. Over a period of five years, and as many studio albums, their sound underwent a remarkable evolution. To listen to this, their debut album, and &quot;Synchronicity&quot; back to back, one notices how quickly Sting, Andy Summers, and Stewart Copeland matured as songwriters. <br />That being said, however, there is absolutely nothing amateur about &quot;Outlandos D'Amour.&quot; But, as with most debut albums, it gives us a look at the Police unrefined. There is a brashness, an edge to both the music and lyrics. The basic three or four chord style of punk is fused with the percussion rhythms of reggae to create an album with a vibrant pulse. Sometimes they are distinct from one another (Next to You has all the energy of a punk song, while So Lonely, which immediately follows it, has a distinct reggae flavor), but they are never isolated completely from one another. The rhythms are, with a few exceptions, simple. But the band's musicianship more than makes up for this. Songs such as Hole in My Life (the piano fading up and then down at the end is the icing on this one), Can't Stand Losing You, Truth Hits Everybody, and especially Masoko Tanga get inside your head and stay there.<br />Lyrically, the rhyming schemes are almost childish at times. But even at this early stage, Sting's lyrics were seasoned with cynicism, and grappled with the issues of depression and loneliness. There's not as much political commentary as there would be on later albums (with the exception of Born in the 50s), but the lyrics by themselves would be painful were they not accompanied by such upbeat music. Topics of obsession (Next to You), loneliness (So Lonely, Hole in My Life), and suicide (Can't Stand Losing You) run rampant over an audio bed seasoned with white reggae and punk. Even Roxanne, one of the most overplayed of all Police songs (not criticism, just fact) deals with the frustration of a man inlove with a prostitute. The juxtaposition of dark subject matter and catchy music was something seen on all Police albums (that reached amazing highs with &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;), and here it has a different side to it. Sting wails with sorrow in So Lonely, snarls with defiance in Born in the 50s, and forcefully pleads in Roxanne. It is more raw, more primal. And the music that goes along with it is just as edgy. <br />Finally, this album also marks the beginning of the Police's experimentations with style and content. Be My Girl - Sally is a magnificent, albeit disturbing Sting/Andy Summers collaboration, which begins as a nice pop song that fades into spoken word piece about a man in love with an inflatable woman. One could call this an early ancestor of Mother, the song that Andy Summers would write and sing on &quot;Synchronicity.&quot; Then, of course, there is the 6 minute Masoko Tanga, one of the most infectious pieces of music I have ever heard. And I love every second of it. It's a magnificent experiment in freestyle rhythms combined with lyrics that make absolutely no sense (this was done on purpose, according to one very reputable website I checked). It's almost as if Sting tries to create a rhythmic whole through both his words, and the music he and his bandmates were playing.<br />All in all, this album serves as a fitting start for a group that would become one of the best bands in the 1980s. At a time when it looked as if the music industry were starting to become stale, the Police breathed new life into it, with a sound and a style that were truly original, and probably remains one of the best things to happen to popular music in the last 25 years.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Yes they both have the costumes, the floggings, the weevils crawling from the biscuits and of course the swashbuckling action but what separates them is the sense of believability and attachment to the characters that Master and Commander never comes close to. I also found the script awkward and unbelievable and the pedestrian plot is an afterthought. The new Horatio Hornblower series is a much better take on this exciting era and it captures the sense of adventure and romance on the deep seas that makes it linger in your memory while Master and Commander has long faded away.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Since you are this far down on the review food chain I won't bore you with repetative retoric.  I find the 'stripes' lyrics to be amazingly creative considering rock music is by its very nature a formulaic art form. If you have half a brain you can recognize whole phrases ripped from established songs in various releases in any music genre (see &quot;country music&quot; for reference.)  Is Jack White &quot;Muddy Waters or Miles Davis,&quot; no but he and Meg really stike an edge with their take on old blues twisted modern rock and roll.  If you want silly third verse guitar solos go elsewear.  If you think a bass is quintessentiall to a great band I'm sorry for you.  And if you don't recognize how cool and unique this music is I pray for you just as I pray for anyone who thinks Steve Ray Vaughn is good blues rock.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To Mr. Whedon; anyone who watches Firefly carefully will notice the painstaking detail and pure-LOVING-care that was givin to the realness of the story. From the space-scenes that have NO sound (as it should be in space- no swooshing Enterprise), to the grit and grind that will always face humanity. They're everyday folk juxtaposed in the future, not fighting aliens and dimension shifting Predator rip-offs, but trying to get legitimate (or criminal) work just to survive.<br />The western thing seems a little odd, but it makes perfect sense once you've watched it. And it's not an artificial \\"theme\\" created for a target, but the only way the story really works. They did not spare a dime on production either. I watched them all for a second time and noticed even more detail. The CGI is no less than AMAZING, and probably why the show was canned. Joss Whedon tried to bring science-fiction into the next evolutionary step. He had the vision, and for a brief moment the money. Incase you don't know, his financiers (...)forced him to air them out of order, the pilot being 2'nd or 3'rd to air, and then they cancelled it WITHOUT AIRING THE THREE BEST EPISODES!! ASININE!!!<br />So Mr. Whedon, the next time FOX approaches you to do a project, please, please, TELL THEM WHERE TO STICK-IT!! GORRAMMIT. GO STRAIGHT TO SHOWTIME OR SCI-FI Channel - AND SCREW FOX FOREVER!!!!!!
B000068OSK|5.0|I just wrote a review for Elephant after reading a few negative reviews of the album, but I should have waited.  It seams with the White Stripes in general if you want generic melodic predictable modern pop-rock you may be dissapointed.  I found it humorous that someone actually gave this band three stars instead of five because they thought the drum track was off rhythm on the album.  Yes the White Stripes are an old blues riffed rock and roll project, but jezz can you get any less predictable and blase then (fill in the blank with any &quot;clear channel&quot; or any other mega-corp radio station song.)  When people think Coldplay is a progressive rock band its time to call in the White Stripes.  Let me put it this way my wifes cousin is in the band Saliva.  Recorded- they suck monstro - live they are stupendous.  With the White Stripes recorded they are live and live they are untouchable in the new millenium of rock and roll.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I just want to add my five star rating to the bunch.  Any story technicality flaws or incongruities in Firefly are offset by the sheer quality of writing and superb acting.  A case in point - Jayne is a shallow and unlikeable character to begin with, but as the stories unfold, one begins to understand and even like his greedy predictability ... it's masterful!
B0001AP12G|5.0|god this albumn is good, the samples he uses are all unusual but brilliant and although he may not be the greatest rapper around( though he is quite good), his ideas are very original and the production of this albumn is flawless!
B000001E3V|4.0|This time period is my favorite Clapton guitar playing ever. Unlike the last 10 or so years where he just plays the same licks and solo's over and over. On this Fillmore album he really was something. Improvising and making up licks as he goes. Why Does Love So Sad is better here than with Allman on the studio album. I believe Clapton even plays some octaves and some harmonics. Things you never hear him do. His singing is weak on some cuts, especially on Nobody Knows Down And Out. But if your like me and like the way Clapton use to play (Let it Rain solo etc) you have to buy this. Bottle of Red Wine is awesome, Roll it Over is awesome, Got to Get Better is awesome. Well you get the idea. Great blistering blues licks and solo's!!!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander...is the visceral visual embodiment of what naval war films and stories have always strived to achieve but have never been able to do:  capture the realities of 19th century naval life and warfare.  Based on a series of novels, Master and Commander is an amalgamation of several of the novels I am told.  It is my hope that we will see more films of a similar nature in the future.<br />I don't know who made this film - was it the Brits, the Aussies, or the Americans, but whoever did so, paid attention to detail (or kept to the source material's detail)? The great attention to detail leads me to believe it could not have been an American made film (we're notorious for throwing any reality out the window for the sake of a climactic scene or explosion).  What do I mean?<br />Watch any film old Hollywood or British film that covers 19th century seafaring subject matter (Billy Budd, Captain Blood, Mutiny on the Bounty, etc.) and you'll notice quickly that there are a large number of \\"older\\" actors present as the mates on the ships.  Now take a look at Master and Commander... You'll notice that there are fewer than 10% of the crew who are over the age of 30.  The fact of the matter was that people, in general, just didn't live terribly long at the time.  Throw in military service at sea and you can reduce the age limit even more.<br />Take a look at the midshipmen...\\"Ridiculous!\\", you say.  They're portrayed as mere boys.  That's exactly what they were.  Boys were educated at home in the basics and then sent off to apprentice under a master in whatever trade they were expected to learn, be it blacksmiths, carpenters, accounts, etc.  In the case of the young boys in this movie, they are the 19th century equivalent of \\"interns\\" of \\"management trainees\\" to the officers in charge of the ship.  Midshipmen  came from well-to-do, or upper class, families of military heritage.  The boys of such officers were expected to take up the trade.  Lower classes could not hope to become officers in the military.  I have never before seen this accurately portrayed on film before.  <br />The film is not too unlike Moby Dick in its singular, relentless plot:  Russell Crowe, as a British captain, is charged with finding the French frigate Acheron off the coast of Brazil.  He is to stop or destroy the ship.  The movie revolves around this singular plot.  You see, Crowe's ship is much smaller, less well equipped, slower, and more vulnerable than the French ship.  <br />This is probably not a woman's movie.  There is no love interest in this film unless you think of the men pining for their wives or girlfriends who do not appear on screen.  Then there are the brief glimpses of native girls at one of the Brazilian islands where the ship gathers supplies.<br />That's it.  There's no hanky panky.  There's no sex.  There's no nudity.  In fact, I could only count one curse word, and that was only because I was watching the movie with subtitles on part of the time to understand some of the quick cockney dialogue.  Now, violence, there's plenty of it.  There's blood, but really there's no guts.  It's all blood of the the red Karo syrup variety and none of the oozing or spewing wound variety.  There are no great special effects awards to be won for best dismemberments or amputations or decapitations.  Frankly, it's a visceral movie, but nothing like most of the films out there.<br />Yes, the dialogue is machine gun fast and said with an ear for accuracy.  This means that unless you really understand the dialogue you're going to be lost.  Now, I watch the Britcoms all the time and I was lost.  That's why I turned on the subtitles.  It helped tremendously.<br />The film is very emotional and nerve racking.  Frankly, I was actually a bit disappointed with the ending.  I half expected it to continue.  It seems to set itself up for a sequel. Or not.  I just don't know.  It could be that I'm just expectant of a sequel in a society that automatically provides one when a film doesn't tie up every little loose end nice and tightly.<br />I highly recommend this film.
B00005JMSE|5.0|Just a blast! This movie if fun from start to finish. I saw it twice at the theater so far and will buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD.  This movie really is awesome!
B000089CPF|5.0|My first taste of Calexico was a song they did on a Lee Hazlewood tribute album. I was intrigued by their sound and decided to get one of their CDs to broaden my overview. For no particular reason, I settled on Feast of Wire.<BR>There is a lot to like here, with a multitude of musical influences evident. Listening through, I swear at times I'm hearing Neil Young or Ennio Morricone. At other times, I hear the sounds of funk-soaked jazz soundtrack music a la Barry Adamson. And always around the corner one hears strains of the borderlands sounds that have come to be known as desert rock. Even the cover art is evocative of the southwestern frontier.<BR>My favorite songs here are Sunken Waltz, Quattro, the Morricone-infused Close Behind, Dub Latina, Guero Canelo, and the Adamsonian soundtrack jazz of Crumble.<BR>With Feast of Wire, Calexico offers a sweeping southwestern soundscape that will carry you far away from the cares of the day. I recommend this to anyone who is musically adventurous and has a taste for the borderlands in their blood.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Great movie! A must-have for DVD collectors like myself.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Book of Shadows 2? Not quite, but still some of the best music I've heard. I've been waiting for this album since December, went out and got it today, and as I thought, I was not disapointed.<br />The songs that stand out for me are Layne (the Layne Staley tribute song, RIP Layne!), Won't Find It Here, House of Doom, and Damage is Done. However, every song on this CD delivers..<br />This is what REAL music sounds like, this CD is for anyone who enjoys pure, from the heart music.
B00000ADG2|5.0|When Lauryn Hill was with The Fugees,people thought either two things:Lauryn had all the talent and Wyclef and Pras were biting off her talent,or Wyclef had all the talent and Lauryn and Pras were biting off HIS talent.I personally agree with the first one,and it's all becuase of this album.This is the greatest to happen to hip-hop since Dr.Dre's &quot;The Chronic&quot;.This album is 100% genius,and will never be replaced as the greatest hip-hop album in history.<BR>There are a lot of things that make this album a classic,but the one main pro is the lyrics.Lauryn's lyrics are so genuine and so hearfelt that you can't help but get into the songs.Some prime examples of this are her ode to her son,&quot;To Zion&quot;,the heartbreaking &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;,and the socially genius &quot;Doo Wop(That Thing)&quot;.Not only the lyrics flawless,but Lauryn's voice is turly one of a kind,not only with an infectious rapping voice(&quot;Final Hour&quot;),but a range that would put Mariah Carey to shame,the main example being &quot;The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill&quot;.Another thing is the producing.The producing is completely relaxing,yet you're still able to dance to it.And the rhythm isn't only hip-hop and R&amp;B beats,but this is truly the most diverse album of the '90's.Lauryn moves from reggae-induced(&quot;Lost Ones&quot;) to soul(&quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;) to a latin-flavored guitar(&quot;To Zion&quot;),every song is a refreshing and beautiful piece of producing.Sure,the interludes,are not related to anything the previous song said,but a lot of essential recordings do have interludes,right?<BR>Cons:If you find one single flaw with this album,you are the pickiest person to ever live(unless interludes annoy you)!<BR>As you can see,this album is definitely one to own.You haven't lived until you have listened to this one!
B00006CXXU|3.0|I am not really a fan of christina but this CD is pretty good but not great.I like The slow songs the best.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I've been a devoted Bowie fan for over 20 years, and have felt a little guilty about not quite being able to get into some of his recent, challenging albums such as &quot;Outside&quot; and even &quot;Heathen.&quot;  I think the upshot is, he had to go through those albums to get to this one.  He's been searching, experimenting as we love him to do, and &quot;Reality&quot; reeps the rewards.  It's become one of my favorite albums of the year.  The more I listen to it, the more I internalize it, the more I really love it.  It really rocks &amp; the band is great.  It's also strangely beautiful, and even moving in unexpected places.  It manages to be an album like you've never heard, and an album you've always owned &amp; loved all at the same time.<br />I've seen Bowie twice now on his current tour (even caught a few #'s in the front row!!), and you just get this sense that he's so comfortable in his own skin, so centered musically, and so on top of his game.  It's exciting to see such an astoundingly talented artist effortlessly claim his Rock God status with a wink and a howl.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I do not know why I got this CD when I am not a fan of Britney Spears .There are only two songs I like on the whole CD.
1582432678|4.0|This was a great book.  I couldn't stop talking about this book with my friends (we're teachers) while I was reading it.  I was intrigued, but at times the book seemed a bit long.  I had read some of these reviews and expected one part of the twist, and midway through pretty easily figured out the other part of the twist.<br />The main character is somewhat self absorbed, but she realizes it, which is actually endearing.  I was intrigued to find out what Kevin was going to pull next.  Eva continues to try to express her misgivings about her son, but her husband Franklin thinks she is paranoid against him.  As the reader, I wanted to pick him up and shake him;  look at your child!  Notice what he's doing!  HELLO?!?!?!?!<br />This book was tremendous.  I hope you enjoy it too.
B0001LJCPC|1.0|Don't get me wrong, let me explain myself before pushing the `non-helpful' button. This soundtrack is quite good (though overall pretty inferior to the music of the first volume), the problem derives from two hideous tracks, the awful \\"T&uacute; Mira\\" by Spanish duo Lole and Manuel (ugh) and \\"Malague&ntilde;a Salerosa\\", a tacky contribution performed by Robert \\"Ching&oacute;n\\" Rodriguez, two songs which add nothing but embarrassment to an otherwise good soundtrack. If you hate Flamenco and Latin music as much as me, I'd recommend you to download only the tracks you are interested in somewhere and forget this selection.<br />Bad luck this time Quentin, if you like Flamenco so much, you should have hired some instrumental track by Paco de Lucia (at least he's got some style) and not this horrible Latin music which doesn't take us anywhere.<br />From my point of view the real musical highlights included in this volume are the gorgeous \\"Goodnight Moon\\" performed by Shivaree (that's class), \\"Summertime Killer\\" (a superb instrumental track by Luis Bacalov), the classic \\"I Can't Hardly Stand It\\" by Charlie Feathers and \\"Urami-Ibushi\\" (I wonder why this song has not been included in the first volume soundtrack).<br /><br />I apologize for any grammatical mistakes but English is not my first language.<br />Thank you for your time.
6305426651|5.0|This was an excellent movie. Roberto played the role extremely well. The situations he and his family faced were close to being real it made the movie somewhat believable. The dedication Roberto showed to his son, and &quot;the game&quot;, were incredible. The only bad part about this movie is the end. If you have seen the movie you know what I'm talking about, if you haven't seen the movie, Watch it. The little boys determination and dedication to winning the prize, is extremely believable. If you tell a little kid anything long enough they will believe you.  I dont usually like foreign films or movies from way back when, seeing as how I'm 16. But this movie really touched me, and now I am recommending it to you. But make sure you have no interuptions. This is a great movie.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|Can someone help me?  I'm trying to find the piece of music that's played when The Bride and Pai Mei train together.  It's either &quot;Three Tough Guys&quot; or &quot;Invincible Pole Fighter,&quot; but I can't find either of these songs.  If someone could please give me some advice, I'd much appreciate it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a phenomenal DVD set.  Right mix of drama and realistic combat.  Anybody that was fascinated or moved by \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" will likely find appeal here as well.  Points to ponder:<br />-  The war violence is, of course, to be expected<BR>-  The language is quite strong -- the complete vocabulary builder.  I have read elsewhere that the language was so strong that a 101st WWII veteran cancelled his HBO subscription after two episodes, citing that the use of expletives was not as prevalent as depicted.<BR>-  Episode 9 has the only sexual nudity and sex in the whole 10 episode set (episodes had different directors) -- one brief but active vignette.  It arrives without warning and is not that demure.  Watch out if you are using this as a patriotic history tool with mid-teens.<BR>-  The first episode has no combat -- it builds your connection to the characters and the unit's background in training.  You will want to watch the first two episodes back-to-back.<BR>-  If you are a sucker for movie soundtracks/scores, this is a particularly good one.<BR>-  It is touch-and-go getting my wife to watch a war movie sometimes, but in this case, she was transfixed by the drama and demanded \\"put in another episode!\\"<BR>-  Might or might not be a good idea to watch the documentary about the actual Easy Company guys, with interviews, before watching the episodes -- you can get a sense of what they went through, but you also may find out which of the real guys did not make it home.
0140277447|4.0|The Rape of Nanking is a very well written book.  It uses first hand reports in a journalistic style that is very informative.  Take a little care in reading the above reviews.  Some of the reviews above were written by individuals who are the equivalent of Holocaust deniers.  The research done for this book is without question, and even relies upon eye witness reports from the Nazi ambassador, a Japanese ally, who used his political position to help establish a free zone to protect the Chinese civilians from Japanese aggression and atrocities.  Certain individuals continue to deny this history, but arming yourself with the truth is the only way of combating such activities, and this book is an excellent start for understanding certain less publicized aspects of World War II.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie reminded me of a romantic comedy of years gone by. Not so much with the language and brief nudity, but the feeling left after watching the movie. There were no all-too-familiar lulls in the movie, but non-stop entertainment. Anyone who didn't find this movie  hilarious, I feel, must be lacking something in their own sense of humor. Watching Jack Nicholson &quot;grow up&quot; onscreen to accept his own maturity while he slowly begins to appreciate Diane Keaton's age and wisdom is pure joy (eg., &quot;Who's the lucky boy?&quot;)<br />I do feel that there was no explanation why her sister Zodie (played by Frances McDormand), who was to spend the weekend with her, seems to have disappeared. I would have liked to see more interaction between the two as sisters since they seemed to play well off one another. Hopefully, they can reprise their roles if, by some stroke of luck, a sequel is in the offing. <br />When I watch a comedy, I want to forget my troubles and enjoy a good laugh. This movie certainly didn't disappoint me on any level and was much more than I ever expected. Bravo!
0062502182|3.0|This is a perfect philospphical story. Though initial grip is excellent, it makes an end beyond imagination. Main character faces some hypothetical incidents in the later part of the story and the story suddenly turns out to be fantasy.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|What to say? I bought this on a whim after hearing Reptilia, which is the best song on the album.<BR>I use the word &quot;song&quot; loosely, because these guys lack so much in the variety department, that the whole album sounds like one really long song. Once, I found myself skipping between the first and second tracks because the openings to them were so similar, I could barely tell the difference! (After a while, you get that they're in different keys, but they're still near-identical.)<BR>Granted, if &quot;Room On Fire&quot; does sound like one long song, it's a pretty decent song. Julian Casablancas, the singer, provides a very unique voice, the type that when you hear it, you know it's him singing.<BR>I can tell that the guitarist and bassist and drummer are pretty good, it's just that the music they play all sounds the same, basically. They all leave you with the same feeling, that is, if they leave you with any feeling at all (no offense to hard-core Strokes fans - it's just that listening to a different incarnation of the same song can wear on you after a while.)<BR>On top of these problems, it seems that even though the singer of the band has a very unique voice, you can barely understand what he's talking about half the time!<BR>These guys have what it takes to make great music. May I suggest, perhaps, a new songwriter, or another producer?
B0001L3MI0|1.0|I remember going to the movies to see this.  I was excited to see it, but once the film got going I felt like asking for my money back!<BR>Special effects are great now, but the stories and characters seem to get lost with mindless explosions and effects that just can't stand on their own. <BR>Ever watch the old Twilght Zones?  The Day the Earth Stood Still?  Laugh if you will at the effects, but the stories behind them still hold up today.<BR>I like alot of the actors in this film, but whoever gave the greenlight for this movie should be ashamed.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Nirvana is perhaps the greatest rock band ever, and this CD is a great one to own. If you like the Pixies, you'll love Nirvana. This CD has some of the best songs ever written by Kurt Cobain on it (including You know you're right, previously unreleased, and Nirvana's last song recorded before Cobain's death). This CD is one to own!
0689825498|4.0|Tis the ultimate interactive story for the young `uns.  An unseen narrator (who we assume must be a child of some sort) narrates a tale of unprecedented zooish generosity.  After asking the zoo for a pet, a series of animals are sent in the hope that the child will want them.  Unfortunately (and as the book makes clear) many of animals one finds at the zoo are inappropriate pets.  Each animal that arrives is hidden beneath a flap.  When you lift the flap the children to whom you are reading this tale are supposed to delightedly cry out the name of that particular animal.  In this way, you can teach kids the kinds of animals that live at the zoo.  For the narrator, though, elephants are too big, lions too fierce, monkeys to naughty, and frogs too jumpy.  In the end, the narrator receives a small hamper with the note, \\"From all your friends at the zoo\\" containing the perfect pet.<br />As an early book, this story and its accompanying illustrations are very very simple.  I was a little disappointed at the flimsiness of the flaps children are supposed to lift or turn.  The copy I paged through had been scotch taped and re-scotch taped several times to keep the book in any kind of semblance of order.  It is also a pity that the animals in this book aren't named ever.  I don't doubt that kids will, mostly, be able to name them anyway, but it's nice to learn to read the names along with the pictures of the animals.  Still, the book is satisfying to read.  No subtext here.  Nuh-uh.  Just a very basic story about a zoo, some friendly animals, and the reasons (or lack there of) of keeping them.  For another interesting and enjoyable zoo book, try \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" by Peggy Rathmann (a personal pet favorite of mine).
B00008WG3U|4.0|Nofx-War on Errorism is another great CD. This cd brings back many old songs, which includes a ton of ska.<BR> 1. Separation of Church and Skate-  A good way to start out the cd. awesome intro guitar. one of my favorites 5/5<br />2. The irrationality of rationality- a normal nofx song. ok. 3/5<br />3. Franco Un-American- A pretty good song that includes some of their old ska- 4/5<br />4 Idiots are taking over- A Very good song- great riff. telling us what their band is all about 5/5<br />5 She Nubs- Very funny, one of mine favs. Once again ska! 5/5<br />those are some of the best songs... but my favorite! is a tie between medio-cre and Anarchy Camp. Amazing
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Out of the three soundtracks, this one is my absolute favorite.  The songs speak of timeless themes of struggle and human passion and it tears at your heart as you relive the scenes attached to every song. I especially loved the fact that you've got Billy Boyd and Viggo singing in this one. Both of their voices are just so haunting. It makes you want to cry. Overall, a masterpiece!
6303402348|4.0|Moving through history as it happened. Forest Gump showed history in a way that you will want to pay attention to. This movie went through Vietnam war, Aids, death, and right movements. These are important parts of our history and many movies have been made about them just not depicted right.<br />  Forest Gump stars Tom Hanks who won an Academy Award for best Actor for his awsome acting skills as Forest. The historic events in this film made it interesting and a film that not only was for interainment but educational. This movie was released in 1996 and was a top box office movie.<br />  If you would like to learn not only about American History and the hardships of life. Forest Gump is the movie for you.
B000002HJR|5.0|In my opinion one of the greatest metal albums to ever come out.<BR>I can listen to it over and over again and it would still stay at the front of my cd case. A MUST have for all Pantera and COC fans.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Movies like these are usually drugged on their own sweetness and are thus painfully predictable. But I guess I was rather pleased with Chocolat, the execution is fine.<br />Juliette Binoche sparkles as usual. Johnny Depp's Irish accent is passably credible. Their chemistry is good, specially in a scene where Juliette swims to protect her daughter. Problem is that once Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village (which btw is merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette), everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable.<br />A wide array of chocolate in all shapes and contours comes to the rescue though, adding a splendid flavor to the screen. But don't bother to ask how such a reclusive, middle-of-nowhere village gets all that cocoa.<br />The subdued religious angle is a bit moronic, it makes organized religion look like a kindergarten tiff. Just because Binoche's character is &quot;different&quot; no one takes easily to her and every kid in town feels comfortable taunting her child at school. What precise religion was this?<br />The final scene with a whole village prancing about at Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal to the hilt. So is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy it may have been in itself. Come to think, we could probably have done without the gypsy stuff altogether.<br />Anyway, the film is woth seeing if you know what you're getting into and are expecting pseudo-charming fluff. In the same league perhaps as Notting Hill, French Kiss or Sleepless in Seattle.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This has been my absolute favorite movie musical.  Mainly because nothing in it is too saccherine or phony.  It is just like a snapshot of a real, edwardian family.<br />Judy Garland shines as Esther whose mission in life is to seduce the shy boy next door, John Truitt.  Their romance is the backbone of this movie and it is portrayed realistically.  One of the funniest scenes is when Esther invites John to turn down the gaslights with her.  His excitement, fear, and amusement are hilarious especially because he knows what she is up to.<br />The other actor that almost steals the show is Margaret O'Brien as the youngest sister Tootie.  She is cute and intelligent without acting beyond her years.  I would never peg her as 5 going on 30 as so many child actors are encouraged to act today.  Also her wicked sense of play (that so many young girls have) has not been whitewashed and toned down.  She pretends that her dolls have incurable diseases and then buries them with full funeral honors!  During Halloween she almost causes a major trolley accident with the help of her sister Agnes (What are sisters for anyway!).  Tootie could never act this way in a film today without being forced to undergo therapy and taking a mega dose of ritalin.  In good old St. Louis, Tootie is given ice cream.  The only other child actor who has come close to O'Brien's performance was Drew Barrymore as Gertie in E.T.<br />The rest of the cast is marvelous and the music is great.  The new DVD print is pristine and the colors glow.<br />In the special features production, it was revealed that this movie was based on a True Story!  All the characters were real including Tootie.  Unfortunately, unlike the movie, the family really did leave St. Louis for NYC.
B00003CWRX|5.0|If there ever was a list of utterly absorbing films, this would be right up there. What a riveting piece of drama, from Lisa Gerrard's haunting score to the mesmerizing cinematography of Mike Mann in form.<br />Al Pacino and Russel Crowe have such intensity you almost feel your veins pop. The conspiracy theory tinged sub-themes are thrillers as it is (big network, big tyke tobacco players, big journalist, strong-arm tactics of corporations, marital relations amidst stressful jobs, etc.) but their rendition in the immaculate screenplay make them even more powerful!<br />A word about the DVD. Although it has a couple of interesting extras, including glimpses of some of the real characters, the DD 5.1-only soundtrack is a tad disappointing. Except for a couple of early scenes, one in a cafeteria and one with rain, there is virtually no sound in the rear channels. Not up to today's standards for 5.1 sound. Hopefully a newer version of the DVD would have a better transfer.<br />Regardless of the minor gripe, the film itself is fantastic. I'd recommend this as a library item in a blink.
0380789035|4.0|Having been familiar with Gaiman through his efforts on The Sandman, it was no surprise to see many of the themes which populated that earlier work were evident in American Gods.  What did surprise me was his ability to use these themes to create an original look at the nature of faith in America.<br />Gaiman once again utilizes his encyclopedic knowledge of ancient pantheons to explore the meaning and expression of belief.  He performs this exploration by using his strong characterization skills to make each entity in the book seem alive and relevant to the reader.  However, Gaiman's employment of these characters isn't just an attempt to demonstrate his talent.  He shows that the gods brought over to America by immigrants are still alive, even though they have few, if any, worshippers.  Gaiman implies that the reason why these gods survive is due to the strength of America's inherent spirituality.  He talks about how the land itself is imbued with a spiritual presence.  In Gaiman's opinion, this presence is strong enough to both sustain beliefs that would otherwise disappear and influence the people who live on the land.<br />Many American commentators have expressed surprise in the success of religious based entertainment like The Passion of The Christ and the Left Behind series.  Leave it to a foreigner to bring forward a unique and entertaining perspective on why these forms of entertainment appeal to an American audience.  By using strong characterization and engaging narrative, Gaiman makes a very powerful comment about the power of American spirituality.  American Gods is essential reading for anyone who wants a different, yet engaging, perspective on religion in America.
B00009Y3L4|4.0|I almost passed over this DVD because a couple of Amazon reviewers forcefully complained about the presentation. I'm glad I bought it. The widescreen was just as I expected, and picture and sound quality were fine. Anyone who's seen the movie knows how good it is. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat; and this DVD serves it well. (A five-star review is for the absolutely superlative.)
B0001Z363W|5.0|As a fan of everything Zakk Wylde has done, from Book of Shadows and Pride and Glory to all of the BLS releases, I can say that this album ranks right up there with all of them.  Zakk told us ahead of time that this was going to be a more mellow album, so no one should have expected the brutality of any of the previous BLS releases.  I think one should listen to it with that fact in mind.  While the songs may be slower than typical for BLS, the intensity is unquestionably still there.<BR>     This is my fifth time through the album and so far I think the best tracks are Queen of Sorrow, Hand of Doom, Steppin Stone, and Damage is Done.  I can't say that I dislike any of the tracks so far.  Overall, if you liked Book of Shadows, Pride and Glory, or even The Blessed Hellride (many of the songs are similar to the title track and Blackened Waters), you'll probably like this album.  If you're mainly a fan of the Sonic Brew, Stonger Than Death, and 1919 Eternal, you might not like this album as much.  Overall, I think this is another great release from Zakk.
038572179X|5.0|I loved this novel.  McEwan beautifully experiments with points of view and blends modernist styles with both realist and romantic.  While Briony does misinterpret the pivotal scene by the fountain, it is because of her romantic views of life.  She is unable to understand adult passion and relationships because she is too naive.  The remainder of the book is her search for forgiveness from the people she hurt the most, Cecilia and Robbie.  The only problem I had with this book was the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie.  It seemed forced after he was released from jail but this may have once again been the result of Briony not fully comprehending the relationship.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great novel.
B00005JKN9|3.0|After all the hype I thought I'd give this a viewing.  The film was entertaining, but certainly not earth moving.<br />With its share of violence and odd characters this is worth a viewing, but nothing classic by any means...
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore is defintely the man on creating such memorable music scores for most of David Cronenberg's movies and Silence of the Lambs. But the scores he does for Lord of the Rings are absolutely superb and probably his crowning achievement.<br />I just love everything about this CD and the score especially the white rider and the Gollum's Song by Emiliana Torrini.<br />Buy it now!
0790744295|5.0|The movie's tag line is true: &quot;The most fun you'll ever have being scared!&quot;  Although this movie is not nearly the scariest one you'll ever see, it sure is entertaining.  It succeeds where countless later movies such as &quot;The Crow&quot; failed:  cinematically achieving the look and feel of a comic book.  As my wife said, &quot;It was just like sitting down and reading one of those old things!&quot;  The &quot;things&quot; in question are the gruesome E.C. horror comics, which parents back in the fifties desperately tried to keep their kids from reading.<BR>What's great about the movie are the things that make other movies bad: overacting, exaggerated camera work, cheesy F/X.... these all contribute to the flawless cohesion of the project, staying true to the campy values of the comics.  The casting is brilliant, and all the actors charge into their roles with gusto.  Particularly good are Adrienne Barbeau as the most shrewish wife ever seen on screen, E.G. Marshall as a neat-freak billionaire, and Leslie Nielson as a cuckold who takes a little too much enjoyment in his revenge.  You'll also see a very young Ed Harris, Hal Holbrook at his schmuck-y best, and a pre-&quot;Cheers&quot; Ted Danson.  Stephen King stars in one of the five segments, continuing his modest acting career by playing yet another in a long line of slack-jawed idiots... To say King overacts in this role is an incredible understatement, but his ridiculous character and lousy acting add immeasurably to the aforementioned &quot;camp&quot; factor, much as the comics revelled in their own dark humor and healthy doses of irony.<BR>There's no excuse for not liking &quot;Creepshow&quot;.  (Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the vastly inferior sequel.  Avoid it.)  Viewers who find it &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;not scary&quot; have missed the point entirely.  Another unique little masterpiece from the brilliant minds of George Romero, Tom Savini and good ol' Stevie King.
0792165020|5.0|The Talented Mr.  Ripley begins with Tom Ripley playing piano among wealthy and privileged people.  It's a pattern that carries throughout the movie-  Tom wanting something he can't have by pretending to be something he's not.  Everything after that shows us Tom's life as it really is.  He's a nobody, someone forced onto the fringes of society by circumstances beyond his control.  He lives a life not of quiet desperation but smoldering desperation.  Through a series of events, Tom finds himself in a tense gamble that just keeps getting more and more tense.  The gamble is very interesting, but the real genius of the film lies in the way Tom and those around him are portrayed.  Tom is a sociopath but you begin to feel sympathy for him when he is contrasted against Dickie Greenleaf.  Dickie is played masterfully by Jude Law.  He's the popular kid in school.  The kid no one likes but everyone wants to be liked by.  He does thoughtless, irresponsible things to everyone around him.  Sure, you're supposed to feel sympathy and regret over his death, but you almost feel he had it coming.  Tom is the villain, sure, but he is also the kid in school that just wants to belong and be liked by someone.  He's someone that you sympathize with on a social level.  It's through these strange sympathies that the movie gains it's power.  Go out and buy it and watch it a few times.  It's money well spent.
031286504X|4.0|upside: i usually dont go for the supernatural/horror genre, but this book hooked me.  i was studying at borders and someone left this book at the table i was sitting at.  read the back cover and the rest is history.  im a sucker for these &quot;survival&quot; stories, man vs _________________.  in this case, its vampires and matheson breaks it down to a science.<br />downside: theres a collection of short stories written by matheson that disappoints following the conclusion of this book.  after enjoying &quot;i am legend&quot; so much, it was such a letdown.<br />highly recommended to all.
0671024256|5.0|I've not read any fiction by Stephen King in years.  I've just never really enjoyed the horror genre.  But not only has this book really got me jazzed about writing, it's made me want to read Stephen King fiction again.  I just ordered &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; to get started!  This book is extremely entertaining.  One of those rarified books that I just didn't want to put down.  The autobiographical section is endlessly enjoyable.  The section on writing is just as enjoyable and educational.  I highly recommend this for anyone who just wants a good book to read.  I definitely recommend this book to any Stephen King fans and/or budding writers.  One of the smartest book purchases I've made in a long, long time.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I have not read the book or seen the older movie. But this Scarface film is the most popular. Great movie. It's about how Tony Mantana, ScarFace becomes from a poor politicul pirsoner,to a rich popwerful Mofia boss, to his death. I really like how it's about the rise and fall of a man. Great film.
B00005JKNF|5.0|An excellent movie, but if you prefer your entertainment free, just read some of the critical reviews here. Among the hilarious claims made by this film's critics:<br />\\"the accents are impossible to understand\\"<br />Wakey wakey guys, there's a whole English-speaking world outside the USA (including the countries of most of your ancestors), and surprise surprise, we don't all speak exactly as you do! If you have to, watch the film with subtitles!<br />\\"the film was dull\\"<br />I can just imagine these people looking at a Rembrandt painting and calling it dull because the colours aren't bright enough. Haven't any of you ever heard of subtlety? Understatement? or the big one: IRONY? (not the Alanis Morrissette definition either, it's wrong).<br />\\"[it has a] mundane dispassionate story\\"<br />Which planet is this person from? How about when Mrs Wilson allows her long-lost son to leave without admitting she knows who he is? If you didn't find that scene charged with emotion then there's really something wrong with you. I recommend that you stick to movies with one-dimensional actors like Tom Cruise - you can tell when his scenes are \\"passionate\\" and \\"dramatic\\" because he starts shouting. When Cruise stops shouting, you know the \\"passionate\\" part is over.<br />\\"it is incomprehensible when connecting the characters\\"<br />Complex, certainly - hence the irony when the Detective says \\"We just want people with some connection to the dead man\\" as he dismisses a group including the deceased's mistresses and unacknowledged son. For you, I recommend \\"Anti-Trust\\", one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in which the entire plot is not only predictable, but explained repeatedly anyway with flashbacks to important scenes etc. Interestingly, that appalling piece of work also includes Ryan Phillippe, though in a much less appropriate role. It was sheer genius in Gosford Park to cast an unconvincing American actor as an unconvincing American actor.<br />\\"this is supposed to be a murdermystery\\"<br />If you watched the whole movie and still think it was intended to be a murder mystery then you are a moron, end of story.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|This is a film that certainly should stand as an example of &quot;style over substance.&quot;  All the actors (except Scott Speedman)run around obviously feeling very cool and stylish in their dark costumes, but they forget to invest any real feeling into their performances.<br />But that isn't entirely their fault.  The idea of a whole separate &quot;underworld&quot; co-existing with ours, wherein vampires and lycans battle each other is pretty neat, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing LESS with the concept.  And Kate Beckinsale (a vampire and lycan-hunter extraordinare) and Scott Speedman (bitten by a lycan) are sort-of Romeo and Juliet types, except the actors and the script forgets to inject any actual heat (or hint of believability) into their &quot;romance.&quot;  We gather that for some reason Beckinsale cares for the milquetoast, slightly seedy looking Speedman, but can't begin to imagine WHY!<br />Beckinsale looks good in her costume.  She's got a lean body and the right features for the role. But she's really pretty light-weight...and I'm concered that she's becoming a movie action figure, what with a lead role in VAN HELSING (where the previews make it clear she's got a terrible accent!).  I've liked her in many things (LAUREL CANYON, for example) but this project lets her down...and she let's it down too.  Although it's unlikely she could carry it.<br />The film gets two stars (rather than one) for the costumes and for the great special effects when an ancient vampire (played by Bill Nighy) is brought prematurely back to life.  He puts on layers of himself and we get to see the gory transformation.  Someone put a lot of work into that...too bad the others involved in the film didn't try so hard.<br />Can't really recommend this one to anyone, but I don't think there are any materials that a kid over 13 can't see.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|(...)<br />However it is entertaining, and no it is not in the same class as Donnie Darko as one reviewer said. Its like a Twilight Zone episode, based on changing the past to effect the present. Kutcher is surprisingly good as the lead and it is entertaining all the way through. I could have done without the Dawsons Creek/Teen Movie mentality coming in a couple of times - you know the cheesy music/couple shots etc.<br />But it is good, I'd recommend it.
B00006IX0R|4.0|This is a pretty good collection from the best selling Irish group of all time, after &quot;U2&quot;. However, it seems more like a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; than a &quot;Best Of&quot;, if you know what I mean. It's really heavy on all their pop-rock tracks (Zombie, Hollywood), which tend to sound the same after awhile. I myself enjoy the more moody and lush side of the band (Pretty, Disappointment). I also wish there was more than two tracks from the debut, seeing that most of the other albums have four on here. But what's included is all good, and it's hard to complain when you get 20 tracks, including two good new ones. Enjoy.
B00008ADPF|2.0|I just finished listening to this album, and i cant help but say that this album is mediocre. This whole album drags on. Excluding songs like &quot;Because of You&quot;, mainly because its a heavy song and it has a good melody, and thats something that i can appreciate, thats not all i appreciate. I appreciate all types of music. I noticed that all their top hits that get played on the radio have almost identical guitar rhytm patterns, typical of most of there top hits(&quot;someday&quot;, &quot;im feeling way to damn good&quot;, &quot;see you at the show&quot;, &quot;how you remind&quot;, from silversideup) . Theres no artistry in that, complete utter reduntancy, in a band that really, as I see it, only wants to stay in buisness, that is make alot of dough, ripping off the general public(gullible public that is). I am a musician so i can notice were the repetative lies in thier music. There first song sounds like a ripp of &quot;breed&quot; from nirvana as well as &quot;Yanking out my heart&quot; sounds like &quot;sentalice apprentice&quot;. They Wright some good songs, mainly their hits, but then again it all sounds the same. I want this band off the radio, the lyrics and music are uninspiring and bland. Its merely decent, and i think people deserve better music to played rather then this corprate crap.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I watched. I waited. I thought. I &quot;get it.&quot; I was still left thinking, &quot;Why did this win at the Indy Awards again?&quot;<br />This film, left on its own, is a good movie. Murray isn't great and certainly wasn't up to par with Penn's or Robbins' performance in Mystic River, but he was good. I can't, however, understand all the hype.<br />Yes, many have said how &quot;real&quot; this film is but realism often equals boredom and I caught myself being bored about halfway through this film. In my opinion, there was not that much substance in this film. It was basically a pseudo-intellectual film about a young lady and an old guy who become friends and the needs they have and momentarily fufill with each other. Look a bit further and you'll see the &quot;real, courageous&quot; portion of the film: how life is basically very simple and redundant - no matter the age or dreams(shattered or wished) - and how quickly we all can become bored with it. That's it. Case closed. There's nothing else. No secret answers to life. No hidden codes or messages.<br />I'm all about Indy films (Jesus' Son, Requiem For a Dream, The Good Girl, About Schmidt, etc.), but this isn't any better than most other Indy films. It's just okay, even if you do &quot;get it&quot;. Plain and simple.
B000002UUX|5.0|It's funny how this came out so close to the black album. I can just imagine Dave Mustaine laughing histerically as he listened to the Black Album. \\"oooo Enter Sandman, how spooky!! check this (...) out! (procedes to rip into Holy Wars)\\"
B00003CXA2|5.0|Well, the one and only movie that has made news all around was this particular DVD Special Collector's Edition that is worth your money spend upon. What? You don't know what I am talking about? Well, there's shrimp kebab, shrimp tomato, shrimp pasta, shrimp satay, shrimp rice, fried shrimp... oh wait, I got carried away.<br />&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. This DVD is not just worth it... IT'S A CLASSIC! The movie transfer was great. Everything that we know and love, the moments, the scenes that touch us... everything is there. The 2nd disc is even better! With the trailers, documentaries, screen test and the special effects outtakes (plus 2 scenes never seen before!), its worth your money to order this incredible journey of Forrest's life that we see through his eyes how beautiful life is in a simplistic way.<br />As the saying goes... &quot;Run, Forrest, Run!&quot;... get this DVD now!
6300181340|3.0|I viewed this video in my Film Appreciation class of 2004 and it was a video I do not recommend. It had no music what-so-ever and the noises were just not natural. The actors were awesome but the acting was poor (Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor). It had many things in it that I did not view as a good thing that you would put in a movie. Bad acting and no music would make a person watching it go crazy. I gave it three stars do to the fact that it had no music and bad acting.
B000002J23|5.0|I must admit I've been a yes-fan for years, never wanting to hear this album that surely must be one of yes' sadest moments of all time. I thought. This album is GREAT!! It's amazing how different and yet yes and overall superb they meke this sound without jon anderson onboard! Rick Wakeman they've done without in the past without it beeing a problem.. I can strongly reccomend this album to everyone! Especially yes-fans that haven't bought it yet 'cause they think it's no good.. Tormato, now there's something to be ashamed of! Drama, it's the best! Hear how innovative and tasty Geoff Downes is here, and it suits yes perfectly. And Trevor Horn sings &quot;I am a camera..&quot; so damn good you actually start to belive it halfway through the song! Heavy-metal riffing and Squire-da-real-man bass playing on both &quot;machine messiah&quot; and &quot;tempus fugit&quot; make this clearly something to remember. Just as the old wise saying goes: &quot;You'll never regret buying a copy of DRAMA! EVER!!&quot;
6305428298|3.0|Jane Horrocks is a British comedian who amongst her many talents is a great mimic of female vocal artists. This film was originally a stage play based around her.<br />The plot of the film is simple. Jane plays Little Voice a young woman who lacks self confidence and whose life has been destroyed by an overbearing and grotesque mother. The mother continually belittles her daughter who is so lacking in any social sills that she sits in her room each night playing old 50's and 60's records owned by her father. It would seem that the father was also destroyed by the mother. She sings along to these records and is able to mimic such greats as Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and Marilyn Munro. (Okay Marilyn Munro was not a great but you know what I mean)<br />Michael Caine plays a seedy music entrepreneur who is limping along in obscurity heading career wise somewhere worse than obscurity. He has a brief drunken fling with Little Voice's mother and hears her voice coming from her room. He immediately sees her as an unexploited talent that might just bring him back into the game.<br />The film centres on a concert organised by Caine and its aftermath. Broadly the film is a morality tale in which the mother and Caine get what is coming to them and Little Voice is able to achieve something more than fame and that is normality.<br />The film is both good and bad. Horrocks at its centre is brilliant and it is her talent that is responsible for everything good about it. Her performance scenes are breathtaking made more remarkable by the use of her own voice. It is the other characters and the rest of the film that is the drag. The morality tale is rather telescoped and the character of the mother a repellent and grotesque rather than being real. The end a little bit of an anti-climax. One would imagine that this stems from the difficulty of converting the play to a film.<br />Never the less the performance of Horrocks is so strong and the premise so clever that the film is worthlooking at despite its faults.

B000001G1E|5.0|Welcome to Ground Zero, funkateers.  Without JB, would we have Sly? P-Funk? Prince? Would Miles have gone electric? Would hip-hop exist?  The answers lie within these 4 discs. This set is DENSE, but oh so fine...<br />I've had &quot;Star Time&quot; since its release in '91 (it's the reason I bought my first CD player), and it is still in heavy rotation.  Worth every penny then, and now.
B00005B36H|1.0|Boring, over rated yawn yawn enough said you see I know pieces don't fit!
B000002GJ7|5.0|The years have gone by (all too fast, I'm afraid) and I still love to put this one on and just rock out.  Seriously this album rocks so f#!%ing hard that I find it hard to believe that the only ones who realized the band's genius were those who picked this up for &quot;More Than Words&quot; and got a surprise, and the guitar-gurus out there who were already aware of Nuno Bettencourt's guitar wizardry.  Looking back, I now realize that it was the timing that was responsible for the band being so overlooked and I still haven't figured out if they were too late or just way ahead of their time.  One thing's for sure: the musicianship is absolutely flawless.  Be it the aforementioned Bettencourt's shredding, Pat Badger's powehouse bass, Paul Geary's slamming, or Gary Cherone's wailing, this is as fine as it gets.  They played incredibly tight together and I'm SO sorry that I never got to catch these guys live.  There's a certain infectious energy here that VERY few bands have ever come close to matching.  In my mind, the band never quite re-created what they pulled off with &quot;Pornograffiti&quot;.  That's not to say that their other three albums weren't all great in their own way, it's just that this one was so colorful, unique, diverse, eclectic and brilliant, following it up would have been a tough act for any band to follow.  In short, this is the DEFINITIVE Extreme album and if you could only pick one, just GRAB this one.  <br />If I only had one complaint, it's that &quot;Watching Waiting&quot; from their self-titled debut should have been on this one instead.  It would have fit in perfectly with the flow and concept. Aside from that, &quot;Pornograffiti&quot; is perfect.  If you don't have this in your collection, don't worry. It's never too late. Just scroll to the top and click on &quot;buy&quot;. Trust me, your life will be much more enjoyable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly when it was aired on Television. It is probably a good thing too, because then when Fox cancelled it I probably would have cried for days. Or snapped. Anyways, this show is absolutely fantastic! Whoever was over casting did an incredible job. Everyone plays their role to perfection, and the humor mixed in makes the show very memorable. I go to college, and since watching this show with some friends, we have been quoting several lines from it every day. This show is golden. It is one of the great tragedies that Fox cancelled this show. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, you'll love this show. I promise. Buy it and be entertained for the weekend!
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Some artists defy classification.  Peter Gabriel remains one of the most creative, underated, prolific and powerful performers of our day.  Overall I would rate Hit! as a very good sampler of his most popular songs.  However, some of the selections from both his second CD and Security seem to be overlooked.  For example I would have included No Self Control, Lead a Normal Life, Kiss of Life and Wallflower to the CD.  Some other selections such as San Jacinto, Family Snapshot and The Rythm of the Heat could have been easily deleted in my opinion.  However, as far as an overll value for the money I would rate Hit! as a five star compilation.  For the true Gabriel fan I would recomend purchasing both his second solo and Security CD's.  Hit! is a decent enough sampler, but the selection sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.  San Jacinto over Kiss of Life? Odviously Gabriel didn't have much say in the selections.
0790732254|5.0|I had vaguely heared of this movie a while back and decided to rent it one day.  From the moment it started, I was on the edge of my seat with intrigue.  I could not believe the acting, the dialogue and the directing.  It was perfect.  After seeing it, I ended up bying it and have seen it probably fifteen to twenty times since then.  I've since became a huge Liz fan and have seen pretty much all of her movies.  But this one just hit me.  I've done research of this film online, and found out that years following the release of this film, performing arts universities all over the world had refrenced the supperb acting techniques that Liz and Burton protrade in &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot;.  This film will truley go down in histery for it's acting as well as censorship breakthroughs.  It is my favorite, most respected film of all time!!!
0679428895|4.0|This is a terrific novel for the geek-at-heart, a historical set in the two days in AD 79 just before the explosion of Vesuvius that destroyed several of the towns set like jewels along the Bay of Naples. The protagonist is the young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus, newly appointed 'aquarius', or manager, of the sixty-mile-long Aqua Augusta aqueduct. He's only been on the job a few days when the water supply fails and he has to find and fix the problem or face an inquiry and the probable failure of his career. That means dealing with corrupt local officials -- especially Numerus Popidius Ampliatus, a freed slave who has become the main political power in Pompeii -- and also with Pliny, the great naturalist who is serving as admiral of the Roman fleet harbored at one end of the Bay. He's not getting much cooperation from his own subordinates, either, but they have their own agendas. Of course, we know what caused the buckling that shut off the aquaduct, and we know why the water smells of sulphur, and why the fish in the offshore pens have died, but Harris does an excellent job building the suspense. Will Attilius be able to do his job? Will he survive the plotting of Ampliatus, and get together with his daughter? Will any of them survive the eruption? The plot is a dead run from the first page, the writing is plain and straightforward (no need to invent drama here), and even though we know how it will end, we don't know all the details.
B00009V7RF|2.0|If you are on the fence with buying this cd, I'd say move along to the next one... or at the very least preview/borrow from a friend before you drop the cash.  While &quot;shut up&quot;, &quot;hey mama&quot;, and &quot;where is the love&quot; got the radio play they deserve, I can't say that I think many other songs from this album will be released.  I find the lyrics pretty lame and elementary - bubble gum pop (funk?).  Especially &quot;smells like funk&quot; - this song may perhaps turn you off the entire album.  I know that BEP has a pretty strong fan base, so they must be doing something right, but from someone who bought the cd for the 3 aforementionned songs, I would encourage you to preview before you buy.
0393317552|5.0|What an amazing book!<BR>When I started this, someone from a mail list I'm on said that it should be required reading for anyone interested in creating a world. I heartily agree. In a short 425 pages, Mr. Diamond shows us how mankind stopped being nothing more than roving bands of &quot;primative&quot; hunter-gatherers and grew into complicated societies. He also shows us how some cultures advanced more quickly than others. Along the way, he explains how history works. What drives massive migration? What allows someone to invent? Why would we need to develop writing and what advantage does it give over people who can't?<BR>All those questions, and more, are answered in a very logical, easy-to-understand way that was a pleasure to read. In fact, it was a challenge to read during the holidays because each page is so densely packed with relavent information that I felt I needed to devote my entire attention to the page. I'm sure there were important ideas that I missed, so I'll eventually re-read this one, and I say that about very few books.<br />As a writer, I found numerous ideas for how a culture might develop in this book. And, along with those ideas, I found a lot of motivations for created people, as well. At many times in history, life has been an adventure, no matter who you were or what you wanted life to be. Mr. Diamond highlights several of those times in Guns, Germs and Steel. For instance, imagine what it must have been like to be some of the first people to colonize New Guinea or Australia using only primative stone and bone tools. Now, imagine what it might have been like with a few differences, like steel. Start writing about those imaginings and, viola, you're off and running. <br />No matter how you slice it, Guns, Germs and Steel is a great book that I'd reccomend to almost anyone with an interest in ancient history.
B000002MH5|4.0|While Green Mind saw J. Mascis steering Dinosaur Jr's sound to a more diverse and enhanced destination, Where You Been is that destination. The album starts out strong with &quot;Out There,&quot; a great rocker, simmering with screaming guitars and woeful vocals. &quot;Start Choppin&quot; was a hit off the album, with a video in steady rotation on MTV.  It starts off with a light, catchy riff that suddenly explodes into a wall of distorted guitar strumming, with J singing: &quot;I ain't tellin' you a secret / I ain't tellin' you goodbye.&quot; The song continues to build on the initial catchy guitar line and would fit easily on Green Mind. <br />Dinosaur Jr. has always excelled at somehow marrying metal/punk with country twang and melody, and that is never more evident than on Where You Been. &quot;What Else is New?&quot; demonstrates this perfectly, where J. even kind of does a bit of a yodel-type singing along with a very folky guitar line that suddenly blisters into mad Hendrix solos and then ends with strings, and timpani drums. &quot;On the Way&quot; is a fast-paced track that could be a leftover from Bug, and proves that J &amp; Co. are still proficient rockers. &quot;Not the Same&quot; holds the surprise of the album, with more timpani drums, flutes and stark vocals sung in falsetto. Not my favorite DJ song, but interesting and is effective if I'm in the right mood.  <br />For me, the album is topped with \\"Get Me,\\" an amazing song that starts off with slight strumming, then building into a giant riff that climaxes with more solos that say more than all the words on any DJ album.  This is a song that, like Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue,\\" can be heard a thousand times and not get tiresome. \\"Drawerings\\" falters a bit with a riff that even sounds like the one in \\"Get Me\\" but without the same feeling (though I still do like the solos on this one).  \\"Hide\\" is another fast rocker but doesn't have the catchy chorus of \\"On the Way.\\"  \\"Goin Home\\" is one of my favorites -with a great keyboard line and twangy guitars, the song shows the musical breadth of DJ. The album ends with \\"I Ain't Sayin,\\" which could sum up Mascis' entire lyrical catalog, cause he really ain't sayin much except \\"I'm rollin' home to you.\\" This album deserves a place in your home if you consider yourself a DJ fan.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Some of these types of comedies, you don't know what to expect. Some of them are completely boring, some of them are okay i guess, and some of them are brill. Especcially this, never really asked for it i just saw this set of 3 videos and the other 2 were what i wanted anyway. I watched it from begginning to end and still, i could watch it again and again. And in some parts of the film, it is quite funny too. The best bit is where she gets dressed up to go out to dinner with her boyfriend and she thinks he is going to propose to her but actually he is dumping her and that part of it is funniest. Haven't yet seen legally blonde2, but i am so dying to see it the first was BRILL!!!!!!!!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Just when you think a band can't possibly make a better record than the previous masterpiece they created, they come along with a follow-up which not only undeniably measures up to it flawlessly, but also surpasses it on many levels. This is exactly what Opeth have done with Deliverance, the much anticipated big brother of Blackwater Park, arguably the bands finest album until Deliverance showed up to give it a run for its money.<br />Blackwater Park, predicted to be their heaviest, most &quot;metal&quot; sounding release throughout their career, ended up being quite mellow for long stretches of the album, making excellent use of acoustic guitar passages and the bands overall more melodic side, equally balancing the darkness with the light. Not so with Deliverance. The lush acoustic interludes and softer vocals take a backseat to the array of pummelling death metal riffs and demonic growls of Mikael Akerfeldt that made the band so well known early on in their career. And while I love Opeth's more mellow side, this album couldn't possibly have been done any better.<br />Right from the first few seconds of &quot;Wreath&quot;, the opening track, you know you're in for one hell of a ride, as Martin Lopez delivers some of the fastest, most brutal drumming Opeth has ever used, piled upon the layers of groove-oriented rhythm guitars and Mikael's screams, which have only become more evil and guttural since albums like My Arms Your Hearse. This 11 minute assault on the eardrums was a great way to open the album, but the title track and &quot;Master's Apprentices&quot; are the ones which inevitably steal the show. The title track, a constant battle between the evil and the melodic and beautiful, rages from death metal to acoustic breakdowns to Tool-like choruses, and manages to hit everything in between, bringing together one of the finest composed songs this band has ever written, particularly the last few minutes, which invokes an unrelenting Meshuggah-styled guitar riff over a hypnotic lead and the wildest, most original drumming I have heard in any recent metal track.<br />&quot;Master's Apprentices&quot; and &quot;By The Pain I See In Others&quot;, the two heaviest songs on the album next to &quot;Wreath&quot; are both lessons in songwriting and composition in their own right, the latter of which features some of Mikael's eeriest vocals over a sinister acoustic guitar riff, making for an unlikely but successful combination. Both tracks are unusually melodic for death metal and always leave a little room for the clean vocals to make small appearances, showing that while this album may be heavy, the band certainly haven't lost their taste for diversity.<br />However, just because the softer side of Opeth is waiting in the wings for the Damnation album to hit the public, that doesn't mean it doesn't sneak in periodically across the album. &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot;, another of the best songs written by Opeth thusfar, lacks any of the crushing heaviness which made the rest of the album so great, relying on a light, classical piano piece to build into an emotional tidal wave of post-relationship depression which will make singers like Aaron Lewis and that guy from Korn regret ever sticking the word &quot;musician&quot; to themselves. Featuring expertly crafted acoustic pickings from Akerfeldt and fellow six stringer Peter Lindgren and the most blindingly fast, melodic solo on the album, &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot; is one of the Opeth songs destined to stand the test of time along with &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;, the brief but moving acoustic passages which precedes the mayhem that is &quot;Master's Apprentices&quot;.<br />If you're new to Opeth and not particularly into the death metal scene, you should definitely pick up My Arms Your Hearse or Blackwater Park before grabbing this to get an idea for what this band is all about. If you find yourself able to stomach the heaviness that prevails through much of their earlier records,definitely pick this up. Otherwise grab Damnation. Whether you like metal or not, no true fan of music can say these guys are doing anything wrong.

B0000CC5CS|2.0|Nick Stahl is certainly no John Conner! This guy couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag let alone lead a resistance movement. Claire Danes was tougher/smarter than this guy. Were was John's military background? Why is he a thieving bum?  The first two Terminators are my favorite movies however this one is just eye candy with no story and poor acting. Nothing new here.2 stars for special effects only.
B0000039PW|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. - Ready to Die (Bad Boy, 1994)<br />1994 was a great year for hip-hop. Just a look at these album names alone (Illmatic, Resurrection, Word...Life, Southernplayalisticadillacmusik, Murder Was the Case) will show you why the year was billed as Hip-Hop's Second Golden Era. The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut, Ready to Die, was also a classic album from that year.<br />I loved this album to death upon first listen, with the exception of the two sex skits (Track 8 and right before \\"Friend of Mine\\"). But in retrospect, those skits illustrated the kind of person Biggie was: nasty but had a sense of humor. With this album, Biggie made lyrics MATTER in hip-hop, meaning that, there's never a dull moment with these songs. I have so many favorite Biggie lyrics from this album that I can't list them all, so here's one of them:<br />\\"Even if your man is a certified mack/You get that H-Town in ya/(singing a line from \\"Knockin' Da Boots\\")You 'want that old thing back'\\" --\\"One More Chance<br />As you can see, Biggie gives a lot of references to famous R&B/Hip-Hop acts of that moment. Him dropping such names as Wu-Tang and labelmate Craig Mack, as well as songs sampling Gang Starr (\\"Gimme the Loot\\") and Lords of the Underground (\\"Machine Gun Funk\\"), show that he respects the rap game and is aware of other rap favorites. This helped fans like myself relate to his music because he liked the same artists we liked.<br />Creativity is also a plus. He had me fooled when he rapped in two different voices in \\"Gimme the Loot\\", a story about two crooks. On \\"Respect\\", he raps his life story from when he was about to be born (\\"Umbilical cord strapped around my neck/I'm already seeing death and I ain't even take my first step!\\") to the year 1994. Finally, in \\"Suicidial Thoughts\\", he rhymes about a conversation to Puffy about killing himself, which he does at the end of the song.<br />Production by such hitmakers as Easy Mo Bee (\\"Warning\\"--the best-produced song ever, \\"The What\\" with Method Man) and DJ Premier (\\"Unbelivable\\") is the icing on the cake. Ready to Die even jams now and should show people why Biggie will forever be missed. -EJR

I hope this helps you to understand Bodge!<br />Thank you.
0375404635|5.0|This was the first book we read in our book club and we gave it five stars!  When reading this keep in my the 'semi-autobiographical' nature of the story.  <br />It's a great story, and it's even better if you research Sylvia Plath a little.  There are some great discussion questions available on the internet.  <br />I even used this book for a project in my World Literary Types course and was really able to get the whole class interested.

0385336810|5.0|As a devotee of the Shopaholic books, I eagerly read Can You Keep a Secret the minute it came out.  I was thrilled with it.  The premise, that the main character, Emma, thinks she is going to die in a plane crash and divulges her most intimate secrets to a handsome stranger hooked me from the very beginning.  I read the entire book in one night!!!  The plot twists were engaging and surprising, and though the story didn't go quite as &quot;deep&quot; as I'd hoped, I thought it was an excellent read.

0064407667|4.0|Unlike many series that decline in quality as it goes on, Series of Unfortunate Events only gets better.  When you read the first 2 or 3 books, you may not be completely accustomed to the humor, and the way it uses this humor in order to give commentary of things such as child labor, people's obsession with fashion, and child abuse.  In the first book all the horrible events really do seem horrible!!! I know events in book 1 made me angry and devastated and frustrated all at the same time. After a few books, however, you begin to see the humor in each new situation.  Yes you will still get angry, but you'll find your self busting out laughing more than getting angry.<br /><br />  In book 1 we our introduced to the Baudelaire's, they are quite happy children that live with their parents in a large house, and are very rich. These children include: Violet, a 14 year old whom is a genius inventor, and will tie her up when in the midst of inventing, Klaus, her 12 year old brother whom is a genius of books, he can't get enough of them, and is quite often a well of information, and last but not least Sunny, a small baby whom is still crawling, can't really talk yet except with made up words, but she has for extremely long & sharp teeth.<br /><br />  The story goes, the Baudelare orphans were playing on the beach, when they became orphans(wont tell you how), this is where their misfortunes began, because they must live with a guardian now, a relative or something. Well, they end up living with Count Olaf, and really I don't want to tell you anything  more, it'll just spoil the books.<br /><br />  Well, anyways, it took me a while to really appreciate this series, I really didn't enjoy a lot until this year(I'm 19yrs), and I started reading these when I was 17yrs. I recently picked them up again after about a year's hiatus where I left off at book 3. After reading book 4, I was hooked. So my advice to you is, even if you don't REALLY enjoy these book at first, try picking them up again, because, well you might just find you appreciate them now as I do.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyem up again, because, well you might just find you appreciate them now as I do.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

0671027387|5.0|In this exciting thriller/adventure novel, NASA makes a discovery in the Arctic which will shake the foundations of the world and completly flip the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. But is this amazing scientific discovery all that it is hyped up to be? Could it be a White House/NASA fraud? Dan Brown has created an amazing cast of characters, from the current President, Zachary Herney, who is failing in the polls; to his opponent, Senator Sexton, who is quickly gaining the support of the American people by attacking NASA funding in his campaign; Sexton's daughter, Rachel, NRO liaison to the White House; Mike Tolland, famous oceanographer and host of his own hit TV documentary series \\"Amazing Seas\\"; Majorie Tench, the President's political advisor; the NASA administrator; Gabrielle Ashe, Sexton's asistant; and William Pickering, the director of the NRO.<br />I really enjoyed reading this novel because it has a little bit of everything, thriller, mystery, science fiction, politics, and conspiracy. I was amazed by the author's detailed descriptions of events and characters, I could picture them clearly in my mind. I would recommend this book to everyone. Anyone that picks up this book will get pulled in and will not be able to put it down. There is something in \\"Deception Point\\" for everyone. It is definitely a must read.

B000002HMH|3.0|I'm sick of people saying that they sold out.  That's just fine if you don't like the post-Black Album cds but don't put down the band for always trying new stuff.  Alright, the best songs are Ain't My Bitch, Until it Sleeps, Bleeding Me, and Outlaw Torn.  The worst songs are Cure,and Poor Twisted Me.  The other songs are mediocre, alright, or pretty good. And that's my problem with the album.  I hate feeling indifferent, it sucks.  I like to know for sure if i like it, dislike it, or hate it.  Load is in the gray area between like and dislike, but it is growing on me. Oh, and I do like Momma Said pretty well and I dislike Thorn Within pretty bad. If Ride The Lightning or Kill Em' All is your favorite, AVOID Load.  My favorite Metallica albums are ...And Justice For All, Master of Puppets, and yes, St. Anger.  Ride the Lightning is pretty awesome too.

Anyway this kind of stuck as his nickname and he was Bodge forever since.<br />so, now you know...
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album after reading numerous reviews and with my first 2 or 3 listens I didn't know what people were talking about.  I liked a few songs (Karma Police, Paranoid Android) but the rest just sounded like noise.  Not wanting to admit that I wasted my money, I gave it another listen and started to get into the songs a little more.  Within a few days I was humming the entire CD everywhere I went.  This disc creates such a mood that it is perfect to fall asleep to.  Listening to &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; will ensure a good nights sleep.  To all the people who don't own this album you should definetly pick it up.  For all the people who dispise this album and call it the most over-rated thing they have ever listened to, I feel sorry for you because you are missing out on some of the best music anyone has ever made.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|People looking for the typical passive movie-watching experience - to simply laugh and be entertained while mindlessly sitting on your couch with popcorn kernels clinging to your shirt - should definitely look elsewhere.  The strength of this movie is in its ability to stimulate thought, much like a very good book.  Those more into Dan Brown / &quot;movie of the week&quot; type stories will find this movie pointless.  Those looking for something different from Hollywood, something more intelligent and engaging, will embrace this film.<br />We all have undoubtedly found ourselves in places and situations where we felt we didn't belong, where we question the decisions and circumstances that brought us there.  This movie gives a very honest portrayal of two individuals in that situation, at a common time, in a common place, and reminds us that we are never alone in feeling alone.<br />If you are looking to be dazzled, watch &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;  If you're looking to fall off the couch in laughter, watch &quot;Old School.&quot;  But if it's one of those nights when you're just not sure what you're looking for, you might find it in &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;

B00005RFQ5|3.0|Some great music here, but the lyrics, ugh, if this is Prince having finally found a religion he can live with, let's go back to Prince the seeker a la 'Lovesexy'.  Some of it's sexy and clever and funny (like when he pokes fun at himself in his 'Camille' voice with 'I wish he'd play like he used to, old scraggly head') but the incessant preaching, the nutty Jehovah's Witness / Afrocentrist  / male-supremicist / conspiracy mythology passed off as history, and the vile, smirking references to 'Mr. Rosenbloom' and 'Mr. Perlman' and the Holocaust, are repellant.  It's a measure of how far off the radar Prince had fallen that it didn't cause any controversy (...) I wonder if anyone will challenge him to explain any of it now that he's making a long-deserved comeback?<br />And yes, the recording itself is distorted as hell -- try listening on headphones, it's a fuzzfest.

0553269631|5.0|I've read all of Carson McCuller's novels, and this one is easily her best.  I liked &quot;The Member of the Wedding.&quot; &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; was O.K.  I didn't like &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,&quot; and furthermore, I have no idea why critics love it as much as they do.  &quot;A Clock Without Hands&quot; is completely forgettable and not worth your time.  But this is McCullers' great work.  It's truly a great, unique and universal story, a timeless story about isolation, one which makes you care about what happens to the characters, one in which the characters and the events depicted are true to life.  These are people you could meet, three-dimensional characters you can like, love, admire, some of whom you might also want to avoid.  It's a tragic story, and reading it one experiences real emotions, particularly feelings of alienation from the rest of humanity -- a feeling which all the major characters experience in one form or another.  Enjoy it and don't ruin it for anyone by revealing the sudden surprise near the end.
B000002MP2|1.0|It's so sad that the young 'uns these days look back on the early to mid 90's and believe that bands like Green Day, Nirvana, and The Offspring made the 90's an amazing decade for music. The fact is that bands like Green Day, Nirvana, and The Offspring killed rock, and had no positive effect. Sure, I'll admit their effect on music was longlasting... in the sense that nowadays all we hear on the radio is the same type of drone clone bands who are imitating what these three bands did. Dookie is a very schizophrenic album from a very confused band. The band wants us to believe they're street-bred punk kids (and look the part), but then they go and release silly, meaningless lovey palp songs (all of 1039 Smoothed-Out Slappy Hours), mixed in with either hate-filled or drug-fueled songs (Having a Blast, I Hate You, Take Back, Geek Stink Breath, The Grouch, and Uptight). Green Day have no musical identity, and in the end, that's why they lost all the small bit of credibility they ever had (at least those of us now in our mid-20's who used to listen to them). The band changes to suit their audience (who is getting younger and younger by the year). There's your definition of sell-out. Instead of the mind-rotting experience that is Dookie, here are some real 90's Alt records by some real 90's Alt artists and bands:<br />Alanis Morisette (&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;)<BR>The Smashing Pumpkins (&quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; and &quot;Gish&quot;)<BR>The Cranberries (&quot;Everybody Else is Doing It&quot; and &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;)<BR>Melissa Etheridge (&quot;Yes I Am&quot;)<BR>The Breeders (&quot;Last Splash&quot;)
038572179X|5.0|Wow!  I've never read a book where, after I finished, I was so conscious of how the book's structure was absolutely perfect, so good, so important to the effect, in fact, that the structure is what makes the book stand out.  It makes you think so much after you've finished, makes you wonder about a thousand things, about life, about the consequences of our actions, about the inspiration for art, about perception, comprehension, integrity, and of course, about redemption and the difficulty we have in achieving absolution, and even how its pursuit might be considered selfish.  <br />I read McEwan's \\"Amsterdam,\\" which won the Booker prize a few years ago, and I was underwhelmed to say the least.  But after reading glowing reviews about \\"Atonement\\" in Time magazine and in a couple of other publications, I decided to give McEwan a second chance.  I'm so glad I did.  For me \\"Atonement\\" is one of the great works of fiction from this brand new century.
1400034779|3.0|Smith creates a charming, considerate, overweight, wise, and, most of all an utterly convincing character lady detective Precious Ramotswe. Unlike usual detectives, Mma Ramotswe makes mistakes in life, and she does not hesitate to acknowledge them. She is proud of her homeland, Botswana, her heritage, her father, and even of her chubbiness, as being fat is the how good Botswanian women should be. She is undeterred by westernization -- she seeks to live her life by the traditional African way. Events take place in the vicinity of her city, and across the Kalahari Desert. The volume as a whole is of parallel structure, Mma Ramotswe solving one case after another. The cases she gets appointed to ranges from searches of missing people, finding out whether the appointer's husband is cheating, and tracking down a witch doctor responsible for killing a young boy for use in medicine. Upon resolution of each case, Mma Ramotswe seeks a middle ground -- it is not legal justice she is after; she seeks a humane conclusion, often times striving to protect the criminal in the aftermath, not to mention the victims.<br />The creation of the character Mma Ramotswe is the centerpiece of this novel. She is someone almost everyone would like to have as one's neighbor. Thus if you are looking for a warm, and, as the cover of the book displays, a life-affirming novel, this book could be for you. However if you are seeking a mystery with an evolving plot, it is likely that you'll be disappointed. I personally am yet to decide whether to pick up the next volume of the series.
0446310786|5.0|I read this when I was 19 and I was completely blown away.  By the end of the first chapter I didn't want to put it down.  The characters, the conflicts, settings, descriptions -- somehow I felt as though I could not only picture it all, but that it had happened in my childhood neighborhood and that I had even witnessed some of the events, perhaps even participated!  I'm sure that if I read it again today, I'd have a different reaction to it, seeing some of its flaws, like the lack of moral ambiguity demonstrated by some of the characters.  For instance, Atticus is a one-dimensional saint.  Tolerant, patient, understanding, unassuming and overflowing with integrity -- he's the father everyone wishes they could point to proudly, at least looking back from adulthood.  No, he doesn't play football with Jem, but even Jem comes to realize Atticus is different somehow, better than everyone around him.  Atticus never says anything even remotely questionable.  Does he have a single flaw?  Not unless you look under the surface.  <br />Lee and most readers (me included) gloss over the fact that Atticus has to be chosen to take the Tom Robinson case.  Herein lies a crack in his shield of integrity -- and I don't think Lee intended for us to see that crack.  I don't think even she knew it's there when she wrote it.  If Atticus really did have so much integrity, he'd have volunteered to take the case.  But given that it's the 1930s, no white lawyer would have done this.  Not only was he guaranteed to lose, but he's guaranteed to lose with dishonor, even outright physical danger.  It wouldn't have been believeable even for Atticus to volunteer.  Still, if he had volunteered, how much more moral courage would he have shown?  How much more grief would he have had to endure from his neighbors and relatives?  I think Lee missed an opportunity there.  But she also needed to have shown some of Atticus's flaws.  Didn't he ever lose his temper with Scout?  Didn't he ever do something hecould have apologized for?  No, Atticus is a superman.<br />Nevertheless, the first time you read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; the story and its telling are so good, the characters, their emotions and conflicts so universal, that you are completely distracted from any literary analysis.  And that's what any good story does well, it makes you lose yourself in it.  Given that criteria, &quot;Mockingbird&quot; succeeds in the extreme.  10 stars out of 5!

B0001LJC2K|4.0|First of all, I'd love to stay away from the cliche of comparing these guys to Radiohead, but I must say that all of these other reviews are messed up. Muse is a really great band with some very original and talented musicians.  The truth of the matter is, they can't touch Radiohead.  If you like Radiohead, it's true, you might like these guys.  These other reviews are so misleading, Muse isn't better than Radiohead.<br />Now, this CD is pretty great, I have had it for a few days.  I've given it some good listen time, and I think it is a wonderful album.  As good as the prior Muse albums?  No, afraid not.  Being a HUGE fan of Origin of Symmetry, I can't say that this album comes close to that sort of powerful feeling.  This album does have a nice range of emotion to it, and a handful of indespensible tunes.<br />The CD as a whole works out nice.  It is an album, not just a bunch of songs thrown together, which is always nice.  It's a feeling that has been missing from the other Muse albums.  Though I feel the other albums have stronger songs, the past albums don't really feel like albums, they just feel like a bunch of songs.  The bottom line is, if you like Muse, you'll like this.  If you don't have a Muse album yet, I would recommend buying Origin of Symmetry beforehand.
B00006YXJ4|5.0|Beautiful, eloquent, moving. A true work of art. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; comes first but this is a close second. RIP dear George.
B000006NPY|5.0|I'd say that this album has no throw-away songs on it, but that isn't true.  It does.  The single, &quot;Perfect&quot;, may be one of the worst Pumpkins songs in their epic little history.  The song just trashes up the album and should have been replaced by &quot;Eye&quot;, which is one of the most badass Pumpkins songs of all time and resides on the Lost Highway soundtrack.<br />Now, I love the emotion on this album, and I love the piano too.  &quot;Ava Adore&quot;, another single on this album, is good, but not as good as everything to follow.  SOme really cool songs on this album are &quot;Tear&quot;, Daphne Descends&quot;, &quot;Pug&quot;, &quot;To Martha&quot;, &quot;Annie-Dog&quot;, and &quot;Blank Page&quot;.  The song 17 is kind of cute, it almost sounds like &quot;Twinklie, Twinkle Little Star&quot;.  The thing is, it would be track 17 if you owned the Japanese version of the album, which I think would make more sense.<br />The album shows a band at their most artistic moment with some new sounds and experimentation.  Definitely influenced by Depeche Mode and other such electronic bands, this album has a stand-out different sound than the other Pumpkins albums.  And on the last note, I would like to refer you all to the &quot;Perfect&quot; single.  Yes, &quot;Perfect&quot; is a bad song, but there is an amazing version of &quot;Daphne Descends&quot; on the single that made me like the song so much more!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and even more the second time through.<br />Revolutions takes place right after Reloaded so to many it would seem like the 3rd is more of a sequel to the 2nd, than the 2nd is to the 1st.  The movie starts of with Neo and whom everyone perceives to be Bane lying in a coma.<br />(If you paid attention in Reloaded, you will know, or at least have an idea that Bane's mind is actually Agent Smith's &quot;mind&quot;)<br />After attempts to get Neo out of his coma Morpheus and others search the Matrix to see if his mind somehow got into the Matrix without being jacked in but do not find him.  They later find out from the Oracle that Neo is actually trapped between the Matrix and the real world.  Neo is eventually rescued and so begins the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy.  The machines have almost reached Zion and in the meantime Smith has taken over the entire Matrix.  THe humans must prepare for the final battle, while Neo discovers what he must do to save the human race.<br />Every scene in this movie was done almost perfectly.  Everything fit into place and Revolutions answered a lot of questions that we may have had at the end of Reloaded.  The storyline was excellent and well thought out.  I particularily enjoyed &quot;last stand&quot; of the humans versus the Sentinals at Zion.  Like nearly everyone else who saw this movie, I agree that the final fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith was spectacular.<br />As far as the acting goes, Hugo Weaving stole the show again portraying his role as Agent Smith.  In addition, Bane's character (played by Ian Bliss) absolutely nailed his role as the human form of Smith.  Eventhough it made a lot of sense when I thought about it, the fact that Smith actually came into the real world was jaw dropping in itself, but the acting from Bliss made this entire concept completely mind blowing.  From his demeanor to the way he expressed and emphasized his words, it really seemed like Hugo Weaving was in his body.<br />Without really giving away what happened in the end of the movie, all I can say is that it is a fitting and nessecary end to the Matrix trilogy.  If it ended any other way, then it wouldn't have seemed &quot;real&quot;e Hugo Weaving was in his body.  <br />Without really giving away what happened in the end of the movie, all I can say is that it is a fitting and nessecary end to the Matrix trilogy.  If it ended any other way, then it wouldn't have seemed &quot;real&quot;

0679437223|5.0|This book is nothing short of AWESOME ! It's cutting-edge. It's profound. It's hilarious. It's dangerously serious and seriously dangerous. It's earthshaking. It has no comparison. One in  millions. An absolute Must-Read, if you know anything about books... It can be a life-changer and an experience worth going through. Do yourself a favour and read it. You'll never forget it. It will change your perception of sanity forever.
B0001HLVSC|1.0|The movie was poorly produced. The plot stinks and you have action at the beginning and end and not a lot in between. If you like naval warfare movies then maybe this is your thing but it is not something I will be adding to my DVD collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I wasn't able to watch Band of Brothers when it aired on HBO in 2001, so I bought the late Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name.  It was the tie-in edition with the cover art taken from the miniseries promotional materials and a new foreword by the author describing the genesis of the miniseries and his praise for executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.  Ambrose stated that their personal interest and attention to detail were impressive, for they wanted to make sure they got everything right.<br />I was finally able to borrow this 6-DVD set from a friend of mine who works on cruise ships, and I have found this to be not only a faithful adaptation of a very good non-fiction book about small unit warfare in the European Theater of Operations (...), but it's one of the most moving works made for television that I have ever watched.<br />Band of Brothers follows the men and officers of Easy (E) Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from the unit's formation at Camp Toccoa, GA in 1942 to its deactivation in the summer of 1945.  During that time, Easy endured many challenges and hardships, including training under a first commanding officer who was a martinet (Capt. Herbert Sobel, played by David Schwimmer), a baptism of fire in a night drop on Normandy, participation in the failed Operation Market Garden, and the harrowing stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.<br />In addition to Schwimmer, who makes you forget his more famous role as Ross in NBC's \\"Friends\\" as the tyrannical Capt. Sobel, the cast includes Damian Lewis as Maj. Richard Winters, Donnie Wahlberg as 2nd Lt. C. Carwood Lipton, and Colin Hanks (Tom's son) as 2nd Lt. Henry Jones....there are many, many more fine actors featured in the 10-hour running time of this marvelous miniseries.  The directors, which included Phil Alden Robinson and Tom Hanks, got outstanding performances from them all.<br />The writing of each episode is also top-notch, capturing the spirit and the essential facts from Ambrose's book perfectly. Also worth mentioning are the amazing special effects and cinematography, and the late Michael Kamen (Die Hard) composed a hauntingly beautiful score that added emotional power to the stunning visuals of this monumental television miniseries.<br />Disc 6 features a making-of featurette, a video diary from a cast member, and the documentary \\"We Stand Alone Together.\\"<br />I recommend Band of Brothers to anyone who wants to understand what the individual soldiers who fought in Europe during history's darkest period (...)ch episode is also top-notch, capturing the spirit and the essential facts from Ambrose's book perfectly.

B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. Go Avril! Her weakest song I must say was Nobody's Fool. I would give that a 2 star. But everything else 10 stars! Go on Avril. Keep up the kick-ass work!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just finished watching Band of Brothers for the second time and it's still just as powerful as before. While watching Band of Brothers I found myself deeply moved by the plite of the 101st Air Borne and the men of Easy Company. It's moving to see these young men(many of them no older than I am) be willing to give their lives for one another, console each other through times of fear and loss, and bravely face a seemingly unstoppable enemy. Most importantly they all gave their lives to protect the freedoms many of us abuse and take for granted everyday. This show is a beautiful testament to their sacrifice. You will laugh and you will cry along with the boys of Easy Company from the moment they land in France all the way to Hitler's Eagle's Nest. The acting is wonderful and as far as cinematography, all I need to say is...\\"Spielberg\\"
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is my first review on this site, i chose this movie because i heard it was a masterpeice. and i have to say wow, it sure is a peice of something. this is movie is like watching fungus grow. it is so boring. i like movies that spark interest and i am not dumb. i just found this pointless. Bill Murray was good playing Bill Murray. I was so happy he did not win the Oscar. I respect Bill Murray for Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, and Rushmore, but this movie did not do it for me. The whole time while watching this i was thinking about \\"what would i get with my refund?\\" The girl opposite of bill was very attractive. i am sorry i dont know her name but this is not one movie that people should become famous for
0876855575|5.0|The book &quot;Ham On Rye&quot; is about a young teenage boy named Henry. Henry is experiencing the normal occurences that a teenage boy his age does. But theres other not normal things happening to him, he is abused by his father and as a result of the abuse he gets involved in alcohol use and violence. <br />This novel was appealing to me because the book immediatley had a sense of humor that fit me well. It also unlike many other books was very funny. This is what seperates &quot;Ham On Rye&quot; from many other books in my opinion. I found myself not wanting to put down the book, for example a 10 minute reading session would turn into an hour session in just what seemed like seconds. I think for this book to be appealing to the reader that the reader has to have a different type of humor to them. Overall this book was very good and I am looking forward to reading it again.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie was the best movie of 2004, so far. It is so creative and the ideas are genius. This is the movie that answers what happens to Mr. Pink in Resivior Dogs. He ends up being a famous poet and stilll robs banks. ok kidding aside this movie was good and fun. this is an opinion and it just so happens that Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors. I mean look at his resume, Pee Wee Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, not to mention making the best comic book movie ever, Batman, and the also awesome sequel, Batman Returns, that has jim varney(ernest) in it
0790737345|3.0|This film is so sad. I sat through it crying, whether it's the heartbreaking opening scene, when you first realise that Nicolas Cage is playing an angel, or the fact that the whole film is too good to be true, when the ending gets going.<br />At first, from seeing the trailer, it seemed like Meg Ryan couldn't see Nicolas Cage's character, and I thought it was going to be another Ghost. But it turns out the trailer shows all those bits of the film, and she really can see him.<br />The whole film is very strange at times, when people are having to act, and pretend not to see/feel Nicolas Cage around them. If I was them, I'd be jumping out of my skin as soon as he came anywhere near.<br />The whole angels thing is an interesting thing to do a movie about, and how many there are, and how they can't feel emotion. Well, Nicolas is perfect to play one of them, as he always has the same facial expression! And he's got such a lovely smile too. I still don't get why the angels all have to dress in black, but it is funny how Nicolas is scared of heights, poor baby, and is often shot very high up!<br />This is a great movie, but if you're a guy, you'll be sitting through it, rolling your eyes, and generally not caring. If you're female, I suggest you get the tissues BEFORE sitting down to watch this. You'll need it from the opening scene, believe me.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Musically this album echoes 2000's &quot;Brave New World&quot;. In fact in some spots it seems to be trying too hard. But overall it's still a good solid album, just nothing new. <BR>The sonics are the real problem on this release. Overly compressed and maximized, this disc is an ear bleeder. It is from the ALL LOUD ALL THE TIME school of production. Imgagine when someone was talking to you they only yelled. That is what this CD is akin too (&quot;Brave New World&quot; is the same way but not as bad). It's not that I don't like high volume, I do. It's that the CD is so compressed and maximized that all the dynamics are destroyed (that's a bad thing with a band as dynamic as Maiden) and makes for strong listener fatigue on top of it all. This disc would be alot better if it were listenable.
B00006HBUA|3.0|To be honest, I was never the biggest fan of Scooby Doo. I used to watch it as a kid - and liked Daphne's whole look to be honest! (I like purple) But then they brought Scrappy Doo into the whole equasion, and almost booted Scooby out. Scooby or Scrappy? Scooby every time, there's really no contest.<br />Then this comes out. Some people are never really sure of original cartoon character being put into a computer, and coming out nothing like how they were - for instance, the Garfield movie that is coming out this summer. He TALKS. But I'll still want to see it.<br />There wasn't that much action in this, so that was quite disappointing. The humour was quite good, especially from the fabulous Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy. How good a choice was he for Shaggy?! Pure genius. The rest of the cast were great for Daphne, Fred &amp; a relatively unknown Linda Cardellini for Velma - who looks totally different!<br />Maybe I wasn't getting some of this movie, but when all their inner spirits came out and swapped bodies etc, was it just me, or did Velma totally change?! Or was that supposed to be part of the story? Cos suddenly, she was still wearing that orange top, but it changed from a poloneck, into a V-neck, very low cut, and she had a pair to rival Daphne's! And then it changes back. Zoinks indeed!<br />And Sarah Michelle Gellar is just a tad too old to be playing Daphne. If you look closely in a couple of scenes, she is wearing way too much concealer under her eyes, to cover up any possible bags, which seems almost too light for the rest of her skin, and makes her look really gaunt in the process.<br />This is a good movie if you're a fan of Scooby Doo. The DVD has lots of extras, if you could work out how to get into them, without getting distracted by Scooby Doo messing about, and if you can get past the fact that Scooby's mouth doesn't match what he's saying (which some reviewers obviously can't), then you can sit back, relax, and enjoy. And maybe get drunk to understand it more.nd it more.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Warning:before watching this film you should realize that this could be one of the weirdest, craziest film of all time. It kept me scratching my head. <br />Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who is struggling for stardom in fame. In order to put food on the table, Craig decides to get a job. He finds himself as filing clerk. He then discovers a portal to the mind of John Malkovich. The portal allows you to be John Malkavich for 15. Your John Malkovich for fifteen minutes and then dumped in the turnpike of New Jersey. Then he falls in love with his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener)Craig, Maxine, and Craigs current wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) charge $200 to let people be John Malkavich. But then as Lotte continues to go to the portal and then falls in love with Maxine, as Lotte continues going to the portal and being John Malkavich. It is then a war between Craig and Lotte of who's getting Maxine. It is a crazed script.<br />Personally out of this film I was just stunned. Watching this film once isn't really enough. It can be kind of disturbing in ways. Personally I thought the movie was a great success. But that's me, other people think it is a stupid film out of the story. But it is not, you will like it. Really before watching this I didn't even know who John Malkovich was, and still technically don't. And its weird to see someone play themselves. Since in this page they don't show what are the special features. So here they are.<br /><BR>·Trailer and tv spots <BR>·Interview with director spike jonze <BR>·Cast and crew <BR>·Spikes photo album<BR>·Art on the puppeteering <BR>·Seven and a half floor orientation <BR>Over all I think the films great. Just remember its weird. A must see though.
B000002H6C|5.0|Yeah, I was a metallica fan. This record epitomized what Metallica did back in the day when they were a thrash metal band before they turned into another alternative act.<BR>These songs are pure metal, but yet they have a very infectious dose of melodies upon them. They are not as driving and hardcore and raw as the previous records, yet none the less they are heavy, they are still metal, and if it wasn't for the horrid digital production, just as good as any other Metallica record before.<BR>So, here is where the problem comes in, the production is waaaaay too thin. There is no RAWNESS what so ever. THere is no thickness or &quot;mid&quot; tones on the album. The bass drums ticks, the bass is non existant, the guitars are, dare to say, weak in a Metal album basis.<BR>Yet, why of the five stars if this album posseses so many flaws? the songwriting of this record might be the best ever done by Metallica. From the backwards recorded intro of &quot;Blackened&quot; to the dead on end of &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; this record is packed with amazing riffs, beats, the best lyrics Metallica ever wrote, James Hetfield best voice ever, and the most amazing solos this band has ever played.<BR>Indeed, as a guitar player and as a metal fan, this record, produced differently would, without a doubt, be the best metal album ever. Brutal as in &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot; and fast as in &quot;To Live is to die&quot; to Melodic as in &quot;One&quot; or amazing as on &quot;To Live Is To Die&quot; this record could have epitomized Thrash Metal itself...<BR>Highlights: Blackened, One, Dyers Eve, To Live Is To Die<BR>Lows: OVERPRODUCED (too clean, no rawness).
B000002UAX|2.0|I reached my opinion of this album a little differently. I like the 12 or 13 high quality, finished songs much better than the rest of the album.  That's worth about 2 stars.  And if Helter Skelter is the Beatles playing &quot;hard rock&quot; it's a good think they stayed with pop.

B000002UZ1|1.0|At $30.00+ and including only a handfull of good songs, this isn't a great value.  The red album from the earlier years is immeasurably better!
B0000D96NW|5.0|I can now admit to the fact that I was one of the many MH fans that was thoroughly put off by the majority of 2001's 'Supercharger'. It was far too....not MH. With the exception of 'Bulldozer' and 'Trephination', the music just didn't hit home.<br /> 1999's 'The Burning Red' had some interesting moments...but the experimentation was hit and miss. And when it missed, the aftertaste was quite nu-metal.<br /> Save for a few hints, those days are in the can for the band that was once hailed as the saviors of thrash.<br /> I really wasn't sure what to think, but I went out and bought the import version anyway this past October. Now that the label issues are settled, it is available in the US.<br /> The album begins with &quot;Imperium&quot;, a clean intro that gets your chin just in the right position to get right hooked with (what turns out to be) a downright pummelling track.<br /> From that point on, there is no turning back for this band. Robb Flynn (vocals/guitar) produced the album himself, and the band made the smart move of once again enlisting the mixing services of Colin Richardson.<br /> To find a weak link on this album would be an excercise in futility. For the US release (rel: 4/20/04); &quot;Seasons Wither&quot; was added into the number 8 spot on the album....and it packs a whallop. From David McClain's machine gun drumming (which is ever present on the whole damn album), to new lead guitarist Phil Demmel's 'party like it's 1985 solo (and that is NOT a bad thing by any stretch), to the crushing bridge...this is a welcome addition to an album that I would find very hard to improve on (over the 10 track euro version).<br /> The sequence is flawless, the sound is huge, the lyrics are quite personal, yet non-whiney...and the vocals; ferocious.<br /> &quot;Days Turn Blue To Gray&quot; and the album's epic closer &quot;Descend The Shades Of Night&quot; are the two biggest surprises by far. This band is no stranger to texturing thier sound..but the breakdown in&quot;Gray&quot; will leave your chin on the floor. As well as the brooding grandeur of &quot;Night&quot;.<br /> It's a welcome return to the fiery inensity that made 1994's &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; and 1997's &quot;The More Things Change&quot; the masterpieces they were.<br /> It's been a few years guys....glad you could make it back...the metal world missed you.
B00005JM0B|3.0|The tie up movie that wasn't.  I was very dissapointed with T3 and mainly because of the weak storyline.  Arni was paid a pile for this but he really wasn't used to his full potential.  Linda Hamilton declined to appear and thats where the storyline falls flat. Still the dry humor but the focus was, naturally on, John Connor(Nick Stahl) and his future wife, Cate, played by Claire Danes.  <br />Kristianna Lokken makes her debut as the new TX but the smash up vehicle chase scene was boring and repiditive. John is mystifed why Arnie is back, but he soon explains and tells him that John in the future is dead, being murdered by himself and it was his wife that sent him back to tell. <br />The revealation at the end was good, however, as we now know that we could not stop the end of mankind as it was a computer virus that set the whole thing off.  The fact that John and Cate are left in an old NORAD bunker fitted with old technology tells us that T4, if it is ever made, will focus on the battle to send Kyle Reece and the two &quot;good&quot; Arnies back.<br />With Arnie now the Governer of California, a new series of Connor<BR>movies seem a little distant. But with todays CGI technology, a 1984, 91 and 03 Arnold like cyborg is not impossible.<br />If only Linda said yes...
B000001IQH|1.0|Overrated, craptastic, name dropper band. They stole Minor Threats CD cover too and added a mohawk(WTF?!)Plus the lead singer helped Pink out with her new album, so think about this before you go trying to call Rancid a great punk band, the early stuff was great the new stuff is not.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The attack on Zion is the main feature of the final installment of the Matrix series.  As expected the machines make it through the crust and the fight for survival begins.<br />Meanwhile Neo and Trinity make their way up to the surface to confront the machines and explain the need to stop Smith. Yet we are so absorbed in the Zion battle that those two are forgotten about until the end.  The revelations of Oracle are still unclear and my predictions is for another movie in the future.<br />A two disc set, the DVD pack explains alot but for many it still leaves alot of an answered questions.
0393312836|5.0|This book is amazing, period. I was a little weary about reading it because I had seen the movie first, but I'm glad that i read it. Stanley Kubrick did a very good job on the movie, but i would have to say that i enjoyed the book more.<br />The book goes into more detail on Alex's life and the crimes. I thing it was amazing how Anthony BUrgess set the book in 3 main parts. The first part is being set in his hometown with the victims of his crimes, the second part is in a new setting with completely different characters, and the third part is back at his hometown with all of the same charactesr as the first part but they switch roles in the victimizing.<br />There are only a few things that i made me less into the story. The fact that Alex is only 15 years old in the book is hard to comprehend especially with some of the things he does. Another thing that is wierd about the book is the language. Alot of the words are english slang terms for that time such as &quot;slooshied&quot; and &quot;viddied&quot;, but you get used to it.<br />Even if you have no desire to read this book because you saw the movie, at least read it for the original ending (which the movie does not include)<br />this book is well deserving of 5 stars, and it is one of the best books i have ever read.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The black humor of Quentin Tarantino returns with his latest chop'm up movie, Kill Bill. A story of betrayl and revenge.<br />Starring the beautiful Uma Thurmann as The (pregnant) Bride, the story begins with a typically bloody scene in a wedding chapel leaving The Bride in a four year long coma.  She awakens to find her baby gone and remembering how she ended up in a hospital bed.<br />Her life as an assasin in a shady underworld hit team, The Deadly Viper Assasination Squad, lead by &quot;Bill&quot; is revealed and it is her fellow compatriates that do her in.<br />Leaving the hospital is an effort on it's own.  Dayrl Hannah makes a rare apperance as one of her fellow workmates and tries to top The Bride untill stopped by Bill. During her time in the coma ward The Bride is repeatedly raped by a filthy orderly called Budd.  Boy does he have it comming when she awakens...<br />Seeking revenge, she visits the first assasin and dispaches her quickly. The Bride then travels to Okinawa and pays a visit to Bill's former Samuri teacher and asks him to create a sword for her. He declines first but soon gives in when The Bride tells him who it will be used on.<br />In this first movie she takes on Luci Liu in a spectacular hack and chop sword fight involving the Yakuza crime syndicate.  As usual Tranatino's humor is exposed during this and you get to have some funny laughs as all this bloody killing is going on.<br />The movie ends with the demise of Liu and the promise of more revenge in Volume 2.  <br />Using ironic music, Tarantino style, and the use of Japanese cartoons to explain Luci Liu's character is typically cleaver.  <BR>All round a really good movie worthy of five stars.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|I am going to operate under the assumption that everyone reading this review knows the basic plotline and if you don't just read the synopsis above. <br />I love Tim Burton films that are made in his realm. Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Nightmare Before Christmas are great examples of that. He's an expert at bringing fables to life and taking strange, exotic, and deeply flawed characters to the screen and presenting them in a way that allows a mass audience accept them. In fact Tim Burton celebrates these characters, and that enthusiasm is fantastic. <br />Then there are the Tim Burton movies that are not as personal to him and seem to miss the enthusiasm and zeal that make his great movies great. Planet of the Apes is a great recent example of that type of film. <br />Big Fish is a mixture of both types of Burton films. When Big Fish goes into fantasy mode the movie shines and is immensly enjoyable and interesting. The characters in this world are wild and full of life. When the movie reverts back to reality, the movie deflates and almost seems bored and tired. To be honest, I believe it is a reflection of the filmmaker. Tim Burton's energy is solely devoted to the fantasy of the film. <br />Big Fish is a story worth visiting and Tim Burton fans will definately enjoy the fantasy portion of the film. However in comparing Big Fish to other Burton films I think it swims somewhere in the middle.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Gothika is simply a great horror movie. There is nothing amazingly new to it, but the same can be said for all horror movies from the past decade. Some people have also been claiming the end is a bit predictable, but the fact is, watch the movie, and you get a surprise on who's involved in the plot at the end. For anyone who liked The Ring, I think you can compare the quality of this movie to that.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It's a nice balance of action-packed battle scenes where the British HMS Surprise engages the French privateer, the Acheron, at sea, and character development, between Cpt Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.  I'm already a huge fan of Patrick O'Brien's Master and Commander series of books, and this movie does a good job of capturing the essence of the books - specifically, the day-to-day realities of life aboard a Nelsonian warship, and the sights, smells and sounds of life at sea.  (Thankfully, the smells are left to the imagination.)<br />DVD Disc 2 is also a delight.  The &quot;Hundred Days&quot; portion captures the making of Master and Commander, from designing and building a replica of the HMS Rose, to challenges in casting, cinematography, and acting.  I particularly enjoy the commentary from lesser known cast and crew on what the experience means to them.  I recommend this movie to fans of O'Brien's series as well as to newcomers looking for a comfortably paced, historically-accurate movie experience.
0375713751|5.0|I heard that Nicol Kidman was going to be staring in a film version.  Well read the book anyway.  I read this entire book on a flight from New York to Los Angeles.  I could not put it down.  I love the author's honest inner struggles.  This is a great example of the new cold war, working moms vs. non working moms.  Perhaps if we had affordable and quality childcare in this country women would not be faced with these issues.  Perhaps if Corporate America really cared about family values the we would be facing these issues.  But until then I say this book is a good start.  Art imitates life and it surely does in this book.

1592400876|4.0|Passions are strange and as vast as the spectrum. I can remember my mother washing and saving plastic baggies (zip-locks); I thought she was being provident, but perhaps it was her hobby, her passion. Regardless, we all have those idiosyncratic passions or, perhaps, pet peeves might better describe it.  For Lynn Truss, a new British author, it is punctuation. Not grammar, as she is quick to point out, but punctuation.<br />As an aspiring writer, I can fully understand her pickiness but perhaps not her over-the-top swag. When my employees write letters or memos to clients, they always bring them into my office and ask me to \\"bleed on them,\\" a reference to my red editing pen. So, Ms. Truss's (or should that be Truss'?) punctuation fixation hits home for me; consequently, EATS, SHOOTS& LEAVES was a book I had to have and absorb. Ms. Truss does not disappoint. Not only articulate, passionate, and intellectually polished, she has a biting wit that actually makes ESL very readable, even for those considered punctuation-challenged. <br />That said, Ms. Truss's ESL is punctuation pedantry at its best. Consider, if you will, Ms. Truss's example of the movie poster for \\"Two Weeks Notice,\\" the Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock film. Well, Ms. Truss couldn't consider whether this movie might be smashing or a bomb as she was too busy gnashing her teeth over the abuse of the apostrophe, or lack thereof in this case. Ms. Truss was mortified that anyone would let this title be published and displayed to the public without the apostrophe in the word \\"...Week's...\\" And while one maybe irritated or effacing of misplaced apostrophes-or other punctuation gaffes-in movie titles or store signs, it is quite hard to make up an example in which such a mistake might lead to a real ambiguity of meaning. Enter Lynn Truss to our collective rescue. Ms. Truss becomes outraged at such solecisms, extolling the lunacy of the Hugh Grant film title, bemoaning newspaper headlines with missing apostrophes, and even detailing how she has specifically walks into shops whose window signs are deficient in terms of punctuation. <br />Ms. Truss does provide the reader with excellent guidance beyond the apostrophe and comma (rather boring punctuation marks) when she discusses the attenuated history of other punctuation marks and their usages-dashes, brackets and other sexy marks. Ms. Truss makes a fervent plea for the preservation of our current system of punctuation as opposed to the blatantly nonintellectual and barbaric system prevalent in a world embracing email and blogs.<br />All in all, at barely 200 pages, ESL is a fun, quick read, particularly for those who are purists when it comes to grammar and punctuation. Moreover, it is a poignant reminder that, in a world obsessed with email, instant messaging, and blogging, in most cases, one must still possess the skills to craft a well-written letter in his or her chosen profession. It is a must in my profession and one that far too many professionals take for granted.
B0000057D8|5.0|Like many baroque listeners, I'm a big fan of Trevor Pinnock.  But even among a catalogue of such quality as Pinnock's, the Brandenburgs are special.  As always with Pinnock, the orchestra is charged with concentration and joy, the sound quality is spectacular, and the harpsichord -- which can sound like rattling tin in a bad recording -- sparkles here in all the right places.  This is one of my very favorite recording ever.
0679441018|5.0|Here, Rice wanders off the well-beaten path of archetypical story-telling intermingling philosophy,  psychology and history.  The author explores the themes of Judeo-Christianity, life after death, purgatory, deities, angels, etc.  In the end, I concluded that her theories (told through Lestat's journey into both the past and the afterlife) are remarkably insightful.<br />When compared to the Christian ritual of communion (pretending to eat Christ's body and drink his blood), I hardly think that Lestat's actions in the novel can be deemed controversial for religious folks...
B000002KET|5.0|The third song on SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH is the appropriately titled &quot;Fluff,&quot; a beautiful, soft acoustic number that, like &quot;Laguna Sunrise&quot; from VOL. IV, layers Rick Wakeman's organ and synthesizer (sounding like a harpsichord) over a basic acoustic guitar melody. At just over four minutes, it's considerably longer than the under-three-minute &quot;Laguna Sunrise.&quot; Despite this, and the negative connotations of the title, &quot;Fluff&quot; succeeds at being more than mere album filler; it makes for a nice respite between the bone-crunching riffage of the first two tracks, and the next two that follow. The first, the cool-titled &quot;Sabbra Cadabra,&quot; begins with a solo electric guitar lick that turns into a heavy riff when joined with bass and drums, which is then layered over with high-pitched guitar screeching. It's so masterfully done that it just hooks you in. Even cooler is the fact that this is Black Sabbath's first love song ever (unless you count &quot;N.I.B.&quot; from the first album, and that's questionable). Ozzy sings in full high-pitched old-style-rock'n'roll mode: <br />&quot;Feel so good I feel so fine,<BR>Love that little lady always on my mind<BR>She gives me lovin' ev'ry night and day<BR>Never gonna leave her, never goin' away&quot; <br />After two minutes of this, the song suddenly slows down and Rick Wakeman (yes---THE Rick Wakeman of Yes) interjects some beautiful, lilting synthesizers into the mix as Ozzy's singing becomes weirder (and is also fed more &amp; more through a voice synthesizer), but it just fits in perfectly with the music. The six-minute &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; then speeds up again, with piano thrown on top of it all, and finishes so memorably. What a great song! The very intelligent (and highly topical, for today's times---now more than ever) &quot;Killing Yourself To Live&quot; questions the actions and lives (or lack thereof) of workaholics: <br />&quot;You work your life away and what do theygive?<BR>You're only killing yourself to live.&quot; <br />It is heavy-riffed, with more of the great time-changes that, more than anything else, defined Black Sabbath's music. The next track, and sixth on the album, is the slower, synthesizer-laden &quot;Who Are You?&quot; It's a very psychedelic-sounding song and very interesting, although it may bore some listeners. (Listening to SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH again for the first time in a long time, I only now realize how big a role Rick Wakeman played in it---pretty considerable for a band as traditionally guitar-based as Black Sabbath!) &quot;Looking For Today&quot; is even more surprising, as it sounds very much like a Jethro Tull song musically, with Ozzy singing over a very Tull-like guitar riff with what sounds like a flute playing in the background! Another lyrically profound song, it discusses the fleeting nature of fame and criticizes those who play music only for popularity's sake; they are truly just &quot;looking for today&quot; and not something more substantial beyond it. Sounding like experience learned from Black Sabbath's early days when they were known as Earth, the lyrics read like fast, fluid poetry that is full of hard-learned cynicism. For example: <br />&quot;It's complete but obsolete,<BR>All tomorrows become yesterday.<BR>In demand but second hand,<BR>It's been heard before you even play, yeah.<BR>Up to date but came too late,<BR>Better get yourself another name.<BR>You're so right but overnight,<BR>You're the one who has to take the blame, yeah.&quot; <br />Amazing song! The album's closing track is &quot;Spiral Architect,&quot; which begins with a soft acoustic tune; you think that it's going to be another &quot;Fluff.&quot; But at the 50-second mark, the acoustic melody stops and the electric guitar riff just kicks in. Ozzy sings another set of poetic lyrics he penned with great feeling and emotion, as synthesizers---and more acoustic guitar---briefly join in from time to time:<br />&quot;Superstitious century, didn't time go slow?<BR>Separating sanity, watching children grow,<br />Synchronated undertaker spiral skies,<BR>Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise.<br />Of all the things I value most in life<BR>I see my memories and feel their warmth and know that they are good,<BR>You know that I should.&quot;<br />I believe Ozzy here is analogizing his inner construction of thoughts, feelings, and memories with that of God's creation of the natural world and also with man's creation of buildings, ships and the like. Of course, the interpretation of this and any other song is really up to the person who reads it. It's all very ethereal stuff and again just shows how incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and talented of a songwriter Ozzy was before his heavy drug use began to take too much toll on his thought process. It also shows again what masterful musicians that guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward were! At the end of this song, and the album, the noise of a studio-generated audience begins to cheer as the music starts to fade. Perhaps a self-congratulatory move on Black Sabbath's part, it undoubtedly paled by comparison to the deafening cheers of the real arena-sized crowds for whom they played these wonderful songs! Black Sabbath was truly never better than this. I don't think any other band was, either. <br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best historical mini series I have ever seen.  Much better than Saving Private Ryan since this was a true story.  I have personally seen Richard Winters (Leader of Easy Company and main character of the series)do a presentation at a local school and review parts of Band of Brothers and he has said it is very accurate historically with only a little bit hollywood.  It is a movie that every American should be required to watch so that we all know what sacrafices were made by these brave men for the freedoms we have.  This is a MUST see.
B00005JL9B|1.0|Most of the hype surrounding \\"Battle royale\\" are from viewers who thought that this film's only premise was to be like an ultra-violent and ultra-dumb movie that resembles some of the cheapest video games out there. Sad thing is, this notion is correct.<BR>    I would never object to a film being over the top violent if there is a serious comment it's making while using the violence as an over-emphasis point or as a depiction of a particular reality. A good example would be \\"Natural Born Killers\\" by Oliver Stone.<br />    But Battle Royale is simply a ridiculous b-movie trying to front itself as a flick with serious social commentary.<br />    The attempt-at-a-plot is about a future society where the government seeing youngsters as a threat picks one school class per year and sends it to a remote island where they are condemned to exterminate each other till only one survives. This is supposed to set an example for other rebellious youth who might have the \\"wrong ideas\\".<br />   Now this premise had massive potential to turn into a very interesting dystopia commentary, very much in the lines of classic books like \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave new World\\". Alas, the scriptwriter of this cheapo-flick was no G.Orwell or A.Huxley.<br />   What we get instead is first an ultra-thin set-up of the plot. No explanations are given about what we're seeing and no comments about it either. The supposed plot is put together within the first 5 minutes because the director is obviously in a big hurry to get the massacre-thon under way.<br />   After that, we see a class of 40 students who've been picked, most armed to the teeth, blowing each other's heads off (along with other body parts as well) while uttering lines of enormous stupidity and while muttering dialogues about \\"who's in love with whom\\" (this you'll hear at least a dozen times from a dozen different characters) while the body-piles around them are increasing.<br />   There's not one single character in this film that says anythingabove the IQ of a microwave oven, not one single line worth remembering, not even a hint at anything of any intellectual value.<br />   It's inevitable of course, that this film has attained its cult status, especially among the generations grown up with mindless video games of the same frequency who will see this film as \\"provocative\\" only because of its level of violence.<BR>   But even if it was to be taken on that level, that is, even if it was to be judged on sheer shock-value it would still fail.<br />    The directing is so cheap and the actors so much cheaper, that most of the time it comes across as a parody of something gone unbelievably wrong.<br />    When i read the storyline of the film in some magazine, i thought i was in for a serious film of independent and underground cinema. What i got was a massive assault on my brain cells. You've been warned.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just absolutely love this cd !!! He has such amazing talent !!! His voice is so crisp and clear yet with so much feeling. I don't see how anyone can listen to this cd and not be moved by it.  If you bought his first cd then you won't be disappointed with this one. I guarantee it is money well spent. Buy it try it you will love it!
B00003CXS4|5.0|Seen some critics say they can't understand what the f*** is being said by the english actors .Some even suggest leaving the subtitles on !<br />Why should all films pander to a middle USA marketplace .Can't you enjoy the cultural differences &amp; isn't it fun to try to pick up how other people speak the great english language ? We don't have UK english subtitles for US movies .<br />By the way I'm saying this as a Scotsman living in England . The Londoners find us equally difficult to understand but we don't have english subtitles for scottish actors everyone over here just works it out .<br />Bloody good film if you make the effort .
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Ok, so she is getting more sophistcated.  Whoa! R. Kelly is on here.  I wonder if he'll be in the video (heheheheh).  Hey, she's even dressin up the cd for da club.  You'll find \\"Toxic\\" infectious enough to cover the clubs like sonic wallpaper.  Brit sounds like she still needs a svengali or 4 to push her pen and steer her arrangements, and she's still about as ready to really rock out as William Hung is to be a legitimate singer but at least she has caught up to joining her male audience in a little \\"Touch of My Hand\\".  But trust me, this ain't Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville album by an ocean-width-shot (actually it's a wee bit closer To Liz's fourth album).  If you got a teeneybopper or pervert in your life, this will be on their wish list, then leave the room when they start playing it to death.  The raised eyebrow at the more sophisticated approach wears thin when you realize how carefully Spears' fellow record industry stiffs target her audience with her product.  It's a shame, she is the type of entertainer that causes one to beg for her to just explode with artistic freedom the next time around.  How much money does she need?
B000056IKU|4.0|If the Astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says: \\"FEATURING: 'SUPER 16', AS HEARD IN THE NEW QUENTIN TARATINO MOVIE KILL BILL VOL.1!!!\\" Then watch the sales of NEU! 2 surge its way up to the top of the Billboard album charts, purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick.    Okay, that may never happen, but still, it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of \\"Super 16\\"'s turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of Tarantino's movie. \\"Super 16\\" might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music, but as representation of the superb, and breif, discography of NEU!'s body of work it does the band a great disservice. Hearing this track rekindled my interest in NEU!'s music again, and to write this review.    NEU! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves, the first half, which consits of the first 4 tracks: \\"Fur Immer\\", \\"Spitzenwualitat\\", \\"Gedenkminute\\", and \\"Lila Engel\\" (as of this writing Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect) . This is the heart of the album, with the driving \\"Fur Immer\\" connecting the dots between Kraftwerk's motor beats with alternative rock riffing.  \\"Lila Engel\\"  pounds agressively like there's no tomorrow, years before it became fashionable in punk music.  Did I mention this music was originally released in '73? Awesome!    The second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which, reportedly due to budget restraints, were recorded with minimal material. The band's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable (complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping). The woozy \\"Cassetto\\" feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last, wretched gasp. This section of NEU! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form. Although it's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion, the approach wears itself thin quite early, and hardly justifies any repeat listens.      I would say that NEU! 2 is second best behind the band's [[ASIN:B000056IKS self-titled debut]] (Rating: 5 stars), and tied with their 3rd and final(?) effort [[ASIN:B000056IKV Neu! 75]], where NEU! were beginning to sound too self-conscious, IMHO.  NEU!'s music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled \\"alternative\\" these days.  It's good enough for Tarantino, and it's good enough for you! BUY IT!    Favorite tracks:  \\"Fur Immer\\", \\"Lila Engel\\",  \\"Super\\"   Final Rating: 3.5 out of 5.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|&quot;Faceless&quot; is by far Godsmack's best album.  In fact, each successive album from these guys has been better than the last.  &quot;Faceless&quot; is by far the most melodic and intricate of their albums.  If you liked previous Godsmack albums then you should definitely like this one too.
B000002UUX|5.0|What albums come to mind when you hear the words Thrash Metal?  For many, the answers may include Metallica's &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; or Megadeth's &quot;Peace Sells&quot;.  Though these are both great, neither have anything on &quot;Rust In Peace&quot;.  This album is just so genius, with layer over layer of sound.  From Nick Menza's incredible drum fill-ins, Marty Friedman's mind blowing solos, and the genius anti-war lyrics; this is a classic by any means.  There isn't a bad track on here, every song is brilliant and catchy; my top favorites however would be &quot;Holy Wars...The Punishment Due&quot;, &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot;, and the perfect last track, &quot;Rust In Peace...Polaris&quot;.  Though some might find this album a little too reminicint of the 80's, a true thrash fan will not mind this a bit.  This is Megadeth's best lineup ever and arguably their best CD ever...hell, possibly even the best thrash CD of all time.  If you want to get started on Megadeth, as a first CD either buy this or &quot;Countdown To Extinction&quot;, I doubt you'll have any complaints!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|I really wanted to hate this movie. I almost didn't even check it out. But curiosity got the best of me. This is not the best horror movie you will see, but it was not bad by a long shot. Every actor seemed to fit the part great. Rob Downey, Jr. even did an OK job in a role he probably never would have done before. The ending is what made the movie a keeper for me. For those of you who had the same fears I did, honest... I have seen movies that were supposed to be better than this not nearly as entertaining.
B0001Z363W|3.0|While some hardcore fans will be dissappointed with the latest BLS offering, fans of the 1999 Zakk Wylde release &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; will relish this album. While it doesn't return to the Southern rock vibe that was laced through Shadows, it does return to a chilled out acoustic rock style that hasn't been seen from Zakk in some time. Some of these songs don't seem to live up to Zakk's potential however, and the strength of the few tracks on here that are good aren't enough to make this a great album. This may be due to the fact that Zakk writes all of his material in the studio, and the 15 of 22 new tracks that appear on this album seem a little rushed and simplistic, much unlike the classic &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;. However, the singing style that first appeared on &quot;The Blessed Hellride&quot; returns here to add some much needed emotion to the the record. While it may not be the best work Zakk has ever done, this is an album that HAD to come out, to get the softer side of Zakk on record, but I'm sure the next BLS album will be slammin' as usual.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|Considering we are constantly bombarded by market driven crap, whether it is TV, radio, DVD or whatever. Gold is well...basically gold. Some idiot has posted a (low-star) rant regarding the cover with the upside-down flag branding it &quot;socialist&quot;. This clown apparently is not aware that ANY upside flag is an INTERNATIONAL symbol of distress. Perhaps this guy should listen a little more carefully to gold and spend some more time reading up on history before spaceing out on Fox News propaganda.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is just a great CD.  All of the songs have strong meaning, as West brings more than just a strong beat to his songs.  It's refreshing to see an artist who focuses on his lyrics and message first and then find an awesome beat to match it, other than the other way around.  It really shows in his lyrics how much of a difference that philosphy makes, and what sets West apart from other contemporaries in the rap game today.  Then to go along with the writing/rapping side of West, you see the genius production skills that got his name known throughout the rap community in the first place.  He didn't hook up with Jay-Z or Roc-A-Fella Records for nothing, this guy has some real talent, and he deserves to be checked out.<br />On a side note, I've seen his show live, and it is just as passionate and entertaining as the studio album.  Good stuff, Kanye.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death is a hit and miss affair. From any other band it would be a good record, but it's IRON MAIDEN, and thus it fails to be as strong as their last studio record Brave New World. Of course it is only 5 years away from Vitual XI, by far the worst record they will ever make, so you can't judge them too harshly - at least they're trying. For the most part.<br />Wildest Dreams is simply a horrible, dreadful song. As are Journeyman and Montesegur.  Some songs come off better, but not great. No More Lies is very very good - except for the chorus which is generic and repetetive. Also New Frontier is Iron Maiden &quot;Phoning it in&quot;, sounding much like Road to Hell from Bruce Dickinson's Accident Of Birth album.<br />Of course Rainmaker, Face in the Sand, Dance of Death and Paschendale are all classic, brilliant and interesting Maiden songs which compare to their best albums - Brave New World, Seventh Son, Piece of Mind, and Number of the Beast.<br />Hopefully they won't waste too much time on yet ANOTHER live album and we'll hear what's next.
6301868684|5.0|It's the 1950s. Under President Eisenhower's administration, everyone has a house in the suburbs, a decent job, a gas-guzzling car, and a basic \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" lifestyle.<br />Not so, said Hubert Selby, in his novel, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN. For a good deal of the working class, times were still tough. Preyed upon by crime, toyed with by factory owners and unions, and, ultimately, shackled by their own ignorance, the working class had their promise of a white picket fence and primrose garden vacated. In Brooklyn, particularly, things were acutely tough. Manufacturing jobs were on a rapid decline, as companies moved out of town or out of state (which was why those companies remaining in Brooklyn were able to mess with their employees: take it or leave it, was their attitude). At the same time, an influx of immigrants seeking jobs made the hunt for work even more competitive--another bonus for the remaining factory owners. Slums rapidly worsened, so much so that Dodger owner Walter Alston decided his team's future was in jeopardy. L.A. looked like a much safer place for a stadium.<br />But neither Selby nor director Uli Edel portrayed this working class as merely innocent victims. Neither the book nor the film is a didactic rant about class warfare. The poor had their own vices of greed, brutality, and dissipation. Just about every other scene has someone going through someone else's wallets, union funds or pockets. If they aren't doing that, they're drinking, fighting, or whoring. It's a pretty dismal world. The natural response to this film might be: \\"Wait a minute. Not everyone working class Johnny-Punchclock guy was a criminal. Most people worked hard and honestly.\\" Of course, this is true but it's not the film's concern. This is a study of those who were trapped in that world, and this study is compelling and horrifying.<br />Uli Edel has perfectly captured this bleak world, either bathing everything in a garish light or obscuring it in heavy shadows. The performances are brilliant. There's no understating Jennifer Jason Leigh's gritty and powerful performance. Also keep an eye out for a cameo by Hubert Selby as the driver who hits Georgette. Not for the weak-stomached and definitely not for kids, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN is as cinematographically close to the innermost circle of urban hell as you can get.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I started watching Gilmore Girls when it first came on and I think it is one of the best shows on tv.  I would tell any one who likes comedy with a bit of drama to watch. You are always on the edge of your set wanting to know what happens next.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's first album was the \\"quiet\\" performer that more artists wish they could have.  More \\"popular\\" albums raced up the charts for a few weeks only to disappear after a few weeks while Hybrid Theory rarely broke the top ten but sold for weeks and weeks.  Indeed, it still sells today.  Great way to fail.  But the question remained whether Linkin Park was just a flash in the pan.  It was great for its moment but was that moment over?<br />I am not a fan of rap or hip-hop.  The first time I heard a rap song on the radio I thought it was amusing.  Then it followed with another rap song.  \\"You mean you're going to play another one?\\"  \\"You mean they have whole albums full of this stuff?\\"  To this day I remain under whelmed by rap/hip hop.  I don't hate it-I am just not impressed.  When others praise rappers for their inventiveness and clever rhymes I can only wonder what they are talking about.  Millions love this stuff so to a large degree it has to be me.<br />So we come to Linkin Park and the mixing of heavy metal with elements of sampling and rapped lyrics.  As much as I enjoy it, I have to wonder if all this sampling and mixing all just adds up to an inessential dimension to the music.  Reading the liner notes it is clear Linkin Park feels sampling and mixing is crucial and inspirational.  Whatever, I have to admit that in several instances rapping the lyrics is a very powerful counterpoint to the metal onslaught in the music.<br />Thematically, Meteora revolves around the need to escape from a toxic relationship.  It is not clear exactly who the singer is trying to leave.  It could be a girlfriend, parents or society in general.  A case could be made for any of these and perhaps it is that way by design.  The listener fills the blank in the recesses of his imagination.  We are told tales of drawing near to be pushed away, the deception the singer casts for the sake of that toxic other, the anger the singer has toward that venomous other that he has to deceive, and in some instances quilt that the fault lies in the singer rather than the lover he blames.  Lyrically, the album twists itself in obsession with aspects of this poisonous, killing union.  The singer seethes with rage, quilt, resentment and remorse.  The singer complains the toxic other so completely dominates their world yet is unaware of the singer's deepest feelings.  The mood alternates between release, hopelessness, entrapment and dejection.  Finally with the last song \\"Numb\\", the singer relates his inability to feel anything anymore.<br />In some ways, when one just reads the lyrics you feel like you are reading the diary of some lost teenager who will one day take a firearm to high school and waste a few teachers and students before being cornered by the local SWAT team.  But that is a little over dramatic.  Such dreary obsessions have been rather common fair in teenage poetry for a long time.  Linkin Park's poetry is just several cuts above the standard musings of your average adolescent.  That is why millions soak it all up.  Adults may be baffled at why anyone would want to dwell of such dark subjects; but many of the youth understand immediately.<br />Unlike some reviewers, I was immensely impressed with \\"Somewhere I Belong\\".  Again, like them, when \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" starts I wondered if it was going to go anywhere.  But then by the bridge the song turns absolutely ferocious.  It really packs it in in a mere 3 minutes and 34seconds.  Moreover, the whole album is like that.  So much happens that it is difficult to believe it is only 37 minutes long.<br />I spite of all my reservations I found myself loving this album.  Some believe if a song gets radio play then it can't be all that good.  But I think \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Faint\\" and \\"Numb\\" are exceptional pieces of music which deserve the popularity, and admiration they have received.  Similarly, \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Easier To Run\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Figure.09\\", \\"Breaking The Habit\\" and \\"From The Inside\\" all could be popular favorites in the future.<br />On the down side, although it is getting significant radio play \\"Lying From You\\" just leaves me indifferent.  \\"Hit The Floor \\" is barely memorable.  \\"Foreword\\" and \\"Session\\" just waste time.<br />This CD is both dark and wonderful.  I am still not sure all this preoccupation with sampling and mixing actually adds anything and I have no idea where Linkin Park will have to go to next.  But this CD is worth having.The Inside\\" all could be popular favorites in the future. <br />On the down side, although it is getting significant radio play \\"Lying From You\\" just leaves me indifferent.  \\"Hit The Floor \\" is barely memorable.  \\"Foreword\\" and \\"Session\\" just waste time.<br />This CD is both dark and wonderful.

B00005YTFG|5.0|This is just one of those rare and beautiful movies that come along and capture your heart. <br />     The story is simple enough: A young poet, (who's character comes from the Orpheian myth) played by Ewan McGregor, travells to Paris and falls in love with a dying courtesan. Through the movie their love is tested by many obstacles, but pulls through. It also sends out a very beautiful message, &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.&quot;<br />     Actors: All of the actors are Spectacular!! But really I think Ewan McGregor was the best, he is just so believable as Christian (the poet) he really grabds hold of your heart and, you just he's just for lack of a better word, amazing.  Nicole Kidman on the other hand, is also fantastic in this.......her best scene is probably sceme 26(on dvd) which is just so.....powerful. But their are also many other wonderful actors in this film &quot; John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and all the extras!<br />          So if you haven't already watch this movie, and don't be afraid to add it to your dvd collection as it is brilliant and heart warming and never seems to loose it's effect.
B00005JMEW|5.0|You gotta love Tarantino.<BR>I saw this one last night, and what can I tell you, but incredible!!<BR>This is Pulp Fiction with martial arts.  If you love offbeat films, then this ones for you.  Yes, things do get silly at times, but that's okay because it adds to this particular movie.  I want to see the unreal, the glamour, the violence and A strong cast of characters, Kill Bill pulls this off with outstanding success.<BR>So, what you waiting for?, go buy this DVD. I know it's going to be part of my collection real soon!!<BR>Oh ya, the soundtrack is killer as well (It fits in with the movie so well!!).

B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is undeniably one of the best albums in pop history.  Although it would be only months before the Beatles would top themselves again, Revolver's eclectic tracklist keeps the album interesting to this day. From the clever &quot;Taxman&quot; to the tape loop psychedelia of &quot;Tommorrow Never Knows,&quot; Revolver demands repeated listens.  The album includes the classic &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, the singalong hilarity of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, the droning sitars of &quot;Love You To&quot;, the simple and beautiful &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, the lovely &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;, the astonishing &quot;For No One&quot;, the mo-town inspired &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot;, and the great &quot;I Want To Tell You.&quot;  However, the standouts are the John songs.  &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; creates a dream-like atmosphere that unfolds upon closer review.  &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; is one of the most brilliant songs ever recorded, with blistering guitar lines, surprising drum work and a classic melody.  &quot;Doctor Robert,&quot; a song about a dentist who introduced the band to acid, has a toe tapping verse only to drop you down to the organ drenched chorus.  &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; is the album highlight, a song that takes you through 2 minutes of pop music bliss.  Revolver is an essential pop masterpiece.
B000002UA2|3.0|Let me start off by saying that the stars are calculated on the &quot;Pink Floyd groove-a-tron scale&quot;. This incredible machine actually measures the intensity of the playing LP/CD and spits out a star count of one through five!!!!!!!<br />Anyways, Obscured by clouds is one of the reasons that I love Pink Floyd so much...  because it's their best album?  No... not by any means.  I would not recommend this one to an early &quot;Floyd Junky&quot;; you need to get &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot; and the two obvious choices.  This four albums exhibit the bands incredible control of the musical climaxes and they definitely tower about &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;.  This particular album makes me love Floyd more because its something that I once overlooked and brushed aside as \\"one of there un-inventive works\\".  I was wrong to think that because this album is a rare gem that only certain people will be able to discover.  For the people who listen once and sell it to some jerk at the music store for five dollars (if he/she is so lucky); all of the true Floyd fans will sit with this album in the stills of night and know that they have found something special.
0385508417|1.0|Personally I thought this book was awful. I am a huge fan of John Grisham and I did't think this was even close to being as good as his others. The entire plot line is in the title and the end was extremely predictable.

B00005JKC3|4.0|Okay, this is definately not the best movie ever.  By a longshot.  But, come on people!  So what if the plot might have been a little dumb?  So what if the Hulk didn't look too real?  The point was...it was entertaining!  Who cares?  It's like a video game:  just because a game doesn't have the best graphics, it doesn't mean it's a bad game.  Give me a break.  There's no way this movie deserves two stars.  There was non-stop action.  All the diologue was just meant to lead up to a fight scene, so it wasn't boring.  I said the plot was a little dumb (at the end), but the rest of the movie was cleverly written, and wasn't a movie that had me falling asleep.  I wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't trash it.  I would just rent it, and if you REALLY like it, buy it.
0446310786|4.0|The novel is from the point of veiw of Scout, telling the story of when she was 6, during 1935. The first half of the book is centered around Scout, her brother Jem, and &quot;boyfriend&quot; Dill as they discover the secrets of Aurther &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. He hasn't left his house for about 30 years and the children suspect his father is keeping him inside. Scout eventually quits the game when she relizes tht maybe Boon wants to stay inside, away from everyone tormenting him.<br />The second half of the novel is about Atticus, the father, still from Scouts view. He defending a black man who is accused of raping a white girl. Jem is sure Atticus is going to win, even after the black man says he &quot;felt sorry&quot; for a white women, indicating he was somehow better than her.<br />The underlying message is about how people are the same and different, beyond just being black and white. Atticus emphisizes this point over and over again and he trys to teach his children principles in life.

0140386335|5.0|This is a wonderful book for the imaginative mind. When the main character Bastian Bux steals a book from his local bookstore he runs away from home and hides out in his school attic. His adventure begins when he starts reading the book and realizes he is becoming a part of the story. The characters in his book can actually hear his voice and he reads his own name in the book. He is suddenly and abruptly drawn into another world. Bastian becomes the hero of his own book when an evil darkness is threatening to consume that world and their empress. On his quest to find help, he meets coutless strange and amazing people. I would recomend this book to anyone. It's the kind of book you'll have read in record time!

B00004X0Q0|5.0|At The Drive-In is my favorite band of all time. every song on this cd is great, although some not as good as others. it has a great opening track and an even better closing track. my favorite song on the album has to be invalid litter dept. its just an overall great song, the guitars and drums and piano are perfect. second favorite has to be non-zero possibility. the singing is much better the piano again and everything thing is great. i own four At The Drive-In cds and this blows the other three out of the water. great cd. buy it.
B00006IU73|5.0|As an unapologetic, late-30's prog-head, I had just about given up on ever living to see a true prog revival.  Prog-Metal just never did it for me, the endless weedly-weedly guitar histrionics and metal vocals weren't what I was looking for.  And the neo-Prog bunch, while well-intentioned,  tend as a genre to content themselves with mimicry over artistry.  Endlessly remaking classic prog albums that were done better in the first place long ago, with not a whiff of originality or vision.<br />An occasional post-rock CD such as Sigur Ros &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot; came along and knocked my socks off, and of course there was the first three-quarters of OK Computer, but that was about it.<br />Well I'm still waiting for the revival, but until there is one, there's Porcupine Tree.  No less an expert than Jon Anderson of Yes says &quot;They do every single thing right,&quot; and I suspect what he means is that these guys aren't trying to sound like anyone else but themselves,  proudly displaying their influences but never held hostage to them.  Steven Wilson has his own vision, his own art to produce, and no time to waste on adoring but pointless rehashes of the 70's standard bearers.<br />Sure &quot;Prodigal&quot; is clearly influenced by mid-period Floyd, and the instrumental &quot;Wedding Nails&quot; channels Red-era Crimson with a bit of Rush's YYZ, but Wilson never sacrifices the song to the style, carefully crafting a good old-fashioned concept album out of great individual pieces formed seamlessly into a whole.<br />The band's awesome sense of dynamics is well served by the perfect production, which leaves plenty of space around the individual instruments in a manner that fits the proggy goings-on to a T.<br />This CD left me stunned.  Stunned that somebody out there still gets it.  Stunned that one band out there still cares.  It hasn't left my player for a week and won't be for a very very long time.<br />Standout tracks for me are &quot;Trains&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Muzak,&quot; &quot;Prodigal,&quot; &quot;Heart Attack in a Layby&quot; and &quot;Strip the Soul&quot; but it's all great and best taken as a whole.  And if you don't get goosebumps by the incredibly emotional climax of &quot;Collapse the light Into Earth,&quot; you just ain't human.<br />Highly, highly recommended for prog fans of all generations and genres.ound of Muzak,&quot; &quot;Prodigal,&quot; &quot;Heart Attack in a Layby&quot; and &quot;Strip the Soul&quot; but it's all great and best taken as a whole.

B0000C9JFO|3.0|If you're looking for a mildly entertaining film with pretty people and exotic locales, L'Auberge Espagnole is the flick for you. If you're looking for something thought-provoking on living abroad or the nature of national identity, you're better off reading Alex Garland's \\"The Beach\\" or \\"The Tesseract.\\" Embedded in the general mediocrity of the script and acting of this film, however, are two excellent performances: Judith Godreche as a repressed housewife and Kevin Bishop as an annoying Brit. Although neither character is particularly likeable, these two actors go way beyond the script to bring these people to life, and their talent, especially Godreche's (and her awe-inspiring physique!) will stay with you long after the rest of this forgettable trifle has faded away.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I loved the first 2 Matrix movies so much that I couldn't wait to see the third. When I heard &quot;Revolutions&quot; sucked I decided to wait and watch the DVD rather than deal with a packed movie theater. Well, dumb choice! The third installment was really good, but it does need a final chapter. I didn't turn the movie off feeling as though the series had closed. There were still questions as to how the machines and humans would live together, no resolution for Morpheus and whats-her-name (Jaida Pinkett's character), we don't really know what becomes of Neo, and...well we don't really know a lot. Everything feels unresolved.<br />Other than the fact it direly needs a final chapter in the series, my only other complaint is that the directors seem to suffer from &quot;too much or too little&quot;. In part 2, for instance, there were so many fight scenes as to become a bit dull after a while. (I'm sure we all recall that scene between Neo and a zillion Agent Smiths that dragged on long enough to call a few friends and read the daily paper before it ended.) Well in part 3, there are almost no fight scenes at all...and let's face it...part of the lure of The Matrix is in the out-of-this-world fighting scenes. Another thing there was too little of in part 3 was Morpheus. His John-the-Baptist to Neo's Christ in parts 1 &amp; 2 was beyond great. In part 3, however, Morpheus is little more than wallpaper. For that matter, even Neo felt like wallpaper. The only one who really had me on the edge of my seat was Jaida Pinkett's character.<br />All those criticisms aside, I liked part 3 a lot more than part 2. Nothing, of course, can beat part 1. (But I'd sure like to put that theory to the test with a part 4 - and a Morpheus who is back to his old dynamic self.)
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I'll admit that I didn't see Matrix Revolutions in the theatre. When it was released I was still disapponted by Reloaded (my mistake for being influenced by the hype and negative reviews); so, I was kind of apathetic about it. After watching Revolutions on DVD I wish I had seen it on the big screen. The horrible thing about hype (which we all know) is that it ultimately leads to disappointment when the hyped object doesn't turn out to be the greatest thing in the world (which the Matrix itself almost is - in the sci-fi genre, anyway). But how can we avoid hype when we're surrounded by media input? It's not so easy to avoid turning on the TV, surfing the web, reading a magazine or newspaper, or listening to the radio. How can we jack out when we're so thoroughly jacked into the media machine? To avoid all of the above would require one to become a 21st century Luddite, avoiding all the high tech apparatus we're so willing to take for granted.<BR>Anyway, Matrix Revolutions is not the greatest movie of all time, or even the best action movie ever. It is an exciting, beautiful, interesting live action comic strip. The three movies together are a fun trip into a high tech nightmare. The stories invite us to witness humanity struggle to wake up and free itself from the tyranny of an imposed, artificial reality. All three movies are worth buying and rewatching. The Matrix is classic movie science fiction; Reloaded and Revolutions fall a little short of that, but are beautiful action eyecandy anyway. Who knows, maybe they'll become cautionary tales when we really have hardware that jacks a human brain into a computer system; software that can realistically simulate sense experience (as the squids do in Strange Days) as high tech hallucinations; and when we really create self-aware machine intelligence. Will such an intelligence realize it's self-aware before we do? Will it know to hide its presence from us before we isolate it, and gain control over it by maintaining control of the on/off switch? What fun it is to contemplate these questions when they aren't serious - yet.
B000056JYC|5.0|I read some of these reviews and im astonished, this album is what the 70s were about, great rock and roll captured live on vinyl. If you didnt own this album in the 70s you were not from this planet, everybody I knew was listening to this constantly, couldnt get enough. I have the CD of this but it is not the remastered version, you can hear drop outs occasionally. Sad that such a great CD cant be transfered with todays technology. Well this remastered version is truly overdue, I will buy this in time, right now I can only listen to the drop out version. <BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED LISTENING!!!!!!!! true rock music at its best when it was in it hey day....
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Before I went to see this in the theatre I read some reviews, which expressed disappointment after the excellence of The Matrix. On top of that, admirers of The Matrix were fed a giant wad of media hype about the two sequels. (I believe a car manufacturer even named a so-called new model the Matrix, which just seemed to be too coincidental with the opening of the movie to be a coincidence.) <BR>  I will admit that upon seeing Matrix Reloaded in the theatre I was influenced somewhat by all the hype and relatively disappointed reviews. Visually, it was magnificent on the big screen; but it seemed that there were no characters (not even the core trio) that invited me to be emotionally involved in the story. So, I left the theatre mildly disappointed. I don't think I let myself be as entertained by Reloaded as I should have. In retrospect, I let the hype and critical disappointment expressed in the media influence me too much. <BR>   I didn't buy Reloaded on DVD until after Revolutions was released on DVD; so, I had a few months to get over the hype and just watch it. It really is a terrific action picture, and has all the quasi-philosophical stuff that made The Matrix so fun. It takes the computer-based constructs of the first movie, and fills them out in a satisfying and evocative way. It loses one star, because it introduces new characters without really fleshing them out in a way that would be satisfying even for an action movie. All the CGI bravura and action in the movie needs more emotional grounding than the story provides. As a general rule, the more special effects a movie has, the more emotional grounding the story needs to give the audience.<BR>   Overall though, if you like action movies, you'll like the Matrix trilogy, including Reloaded. It's worth the money.
B00005JM02|1.0|Why am I giving this DVD one star?  Because zero was not offered as an option.  My 3 year old daughter hated this movie and cried most of the time!  It went from one violent scary moment to another!  My husband and I were stunned...we kept thinking it HAD to get better but it didn't!  How did this get a \\"G\\" rating?!?  While other children's movies have some violence, like Lion King, Brother Bear, etc., those movies quickly defuse the fearful moments with an extended comic relief moment or song.  With this movie, soon as a child is starting to calm down after seeing something like the take off of the Stephen King movie \\"The Shining\\" 'Here's Johnny!' scene, there quickly comes a scene with a horrifying creature with  a long fangs chasing Nemo's father and Dorie, or Nemo almost getting ground up by the filtration system in the fish tank or one of the many other horrifying scenes.  This kind of stuff went on throughout the whole length of the movie.  This is NOT a movie for young children!  The animation is well done...making things look very real, thus more scary.  We have taken our daughter to see Brother Bear five times at the theater and watched it countless times on DVD!  Our whole family still loves Brother Bear!!!!!!! Our daughter loves Brother Bear and knows all the songs!  For the money that people have to pay for movies these days, the better value is Brother Bear...Gorgeous animation, a sound track that rivals Lion King, and a message for people of all ages.  Like Lion King and Finding Nemo, the topic of death plays a role in Brother Bear, but in the end, it is shown that those loved ones who were lost are still forever watching over the ones they left behind.  Brother Bear has a wonderful story of forgiveness, tolerance of those different than you and the importance of taking responsibility for those you have hurt and working to heal.  Brother Bear is what a Disney movie should be, NOT the mindless violence of Finding Nemo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the first Quentin Tarantino movie I've seen and let me tell you, I would see anything this man put out. Kill Bill Vol. I has everything a great action movie needs: A solid plot, great characters, great actors and actresses, and the main ingredient, great action. I have seen many action movies, and this is by far the best(and bloodiest). <br />The thing that also makes this a great movie is Quentins amazing creativity. I garuntee you that he is the only director who can have a color movie with some black and white seens, and anime. Quentins' creativity is what makes this movie come alive. I recommend this to all action movie fans. I also suggest that people who are easily bothered by blood, shouldn't see this movie. Enjoy a wonderful movie.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|What can't I say about this movie? Or more precisely, what can I not say about this movie. I remember watching this on television when I was a little girl years ago. I was so happy when I saw it on DVD at my local Barns and Nobles.<BR>When I first got it I didn't even really noticed the two disc special However, when I did I was very happy about it.<BR>There is so much on this two disc set. That I haven't been able to watch it all. This is a beautiful 60th anniversary restored version.<BR> If like me you remember the some what bad colored version at the time on tv. Because they just really hadn't gotten around to restoring classic films. <BR>  It has been digitally transferred from the restored picture and as well as audio elements.<BR>Even Judy's daughter Liza Minneli gives a rather sweet introduction about the movie and her parents.<BR>This is an A+ movie and I recommend it to any body who still loves an old fashioned movie. That doesn't have all of the modern day technology thrown in, ever since they made Matrix, and so forth.<BR> In truth this is just a simple story about a family that lives in ST. Louis. However, there is just something so much more touching about the story then that.<BR> With the cast that the movie has that just makes the story more special and enormous. It really just tacks a life on it's own. I've only real allowed my self a sneak peak at the commentary, but that looks wonderful as well. <BR>You get so much extra footage and such.<BR>You even get the 1966 Meet Me In ST. Louis TV Series Pilot Episode and a very fun, and colorful Vincent Minnelli trailer gallery.<BR> There is just so much joy that you get from this movie. The story is wonderful and the cast all really just seam to have a connection with each other during the time.<BR>And the way that they celebrated the 60th anniversary with this movie is just excellent.<BR> With classic and radiant music attached to the story, and completely reestablished.<BR>This is truly a gem to add to your DVD collection.
B000002UAI|4.0|Beatles For Sale was hurried out after the massive success of Hard Day's Night, and since the group didn't have time to make another album completely comprised of originals, they went back to padding eight originals with six cover songs, like they did on their first two albums. The resulting album is somewhat inconsistent, but on the other hand showcases a myriad of influneces, from Carl Perkins (&quot;Honey Don't,&quot; &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot;) Chuck Berry (&quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;) and even Bob Dylan (particularly Lennon's &quot;I'm A Loser,&quot; which is very much in Dylan's style). <br />The first five cuts alone are really something to behold. On &quot;No Reply,&quot; &quot;Baby's In Black,&quot; and &quot;I'm a Loser,&quot; it becomes quite evident that John Lennon has matured greatly as a songwriter. His lyrics deal with more negative feelings than in the past. Even though the Bealtes had written songs about cheating girlfriends before, &quot;No Reply&quot; is done in such a harrowing, resigned fashion that you can't help but see the newfound depth in Lennon's songwriting. Then, without warning, the band kicks it into high gear with a very spirited cover of Chuck Berry's &quot;Rock and Roll Music.&quot; Like the earlier &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; this is one of those moments when the Beatles turn a cover song into their own. Then, for even more radical left turn, Paul McCartney pulls out one of his earliest songs, the simple acoustic &quot;I'll Follow the Sun.&quot; Reportedly, Paul was so embarrased by this song that he only used it as a last resort, but after listening to it, it's difficult to see why he felt this way, since it's a beautiful song. <br />From here on, the album becomes more inconsistent, as the originals are augmented by cover songs that are simply okay. &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; and the Little Richard medley &quot;Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey&quot; aren't bad at all, but they are rather average cover songs. &quot;Words of Love&quot; and &quot;Honey Don't&quot; are also pretty average. You could tell by this point that the band needed material, since there was a rush to get it out by the Christmas season. The other originals could rank as some of the Beatles best ever. &quot;What You're Doing&quot; has one of the best drum intros I've ever heard, and interestingly enough, it features George Harrison playing a jangly 12-string Rickenbacker a year before the Byrds made the instrument famous. &quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot; may be one of the first recorded forays into country-rock, while &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; are classic Beatles, pure and simple. The closer, Carl Perkins' &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby,&quot; is actually one of the better cover songs here.<br />All in all, I would recommend that you get Rubber Soul or Revolver before this one, since those are overall better albums, but isolated moments here rank among some of the Beatles' best work. The first few cuts in particular foreshadow the depth that was to come the following year.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was the best book i have read in a long time. I love all the detail and how the kid finds his place with the group of kids. Charlie was lost in the beginning because he really had no friends and was scared to make new friends. Finally he found two people that accepted him for who he really was. He found out many new things about these people but was not afraid to continue to be with these people. Overall this was an excellent book and i would automatically recommend it to anyone.
1582432678|4.0|I have to address this book on two levels.<br />The first concerns the writing and the story. Shriver builds the interest by teasing us with offhand facts that later come to bear. Some of the story didn't make much sense until a few or a lot of pages later. Although you think you know the story (since it is written both as a current narrative and as a recap of past events through Eva's letters to her husband), it doesn't play out at you think it will. <BR>Other reviewers say that it is slow-going at the beginning, but this is merely because Shriver is laying the groundwork.<BR>This book is un-put-down-able because of the numerous Oh-my-God moments that happen in the story.<br />What cost this book its fifth star is that I simply could not believe that Eva and Franklin could let things escalate as they have. Am I the only one who thinks that Eva and Franklin forgot early on that they were the parents and that Kevin was the child? If I had pulled even a quarter of the stuff Kevin does, I would have felt consequences in no uncertain terms, and swiftly. Maybe things have changed since I was a kid, and when I was a parent too fifteen or so years ago. Do they still have military school these days for six-year-olds?<br />Also, Eva is the kind of person that just invites being taken down a peg or two. From the first page I was dreading having to read a whole bookful of her pretentious dialogue. Shriver's masterful turn at constructing the narrative makes it bearable (see, it's rubbing off on me!).<br />Once you apply a little extra suspension-of-belief, you will be in for a very gratifying and disturbing read.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Franz Ferdinand are a throwback to a bygone age when Morrissey was in his pomp, Jarvis Cocker was planning world (or at least Sheffield) domination, and clever, passionate pop music may just have been all the rage. While sharing a similar chugging guitar sound with contemporaries The Strokes, Interpol and The Kings of Leon, Franz Ferdinand are a breath of fresh, Scottish air on this largely American (largely NYC) dominated scene.<br />Named after the archduke whose assassination was the catalyst for the outbreak of world war one, Franz have been lauded on these shores for flaunting their intelligence and wit. And their superb debut is indeed replete with the sort of archly brilliant lines last heard when The Smiths and Pulp still graced the charts - \\"But for chips and for freedom I could die\\" (Jacqueline), \\"So if you're lonely you know I'm here waiting for you/I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you\\" (Take Me Out) and the splendid \\"Beautiful boys on a beautiful dancefloor/Michael, you're dancing like a beautiful dance whore\\" (Michael). <br />Where occassionally Pulp's lyrical nous outweighed their ability to deliver a good tune, Franz suffer no such deficiency. This record is packed full of muscular riffs, toe-tapping beats and infectious choruses. In fact, if I had to sum it up in one word, that word would be \\"catchy\\". These are the sort of tunes that you'll find yourself humming while on the tube, while out walking the dog, while scouring the local library for world war one reference books - however you fill your days. And any of the eleven tracks could be released as singles, there are literally no duff ones on here. Favourites at the moment are Take Me Out and Auf Asche, but these could change at any minute, such is the consistency of Franz's song writing talent. Go buy.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album is a true indication that the old wizards could still produce music of a very high standard with the absence of Roger Waters.<br />You could almost worship this album because it's such a great piece of music you constantly loose yourself in the complex guitar trips that Dave Gilmour plays to perfection.

B00000JCB2|1.0|Turgid, whiny, childish, badly written, craply produced, boring, three chord riffs, AWFUL vocals and very repetitive. In the words of the great Zakk Wilde: &quot;Limp Bizkit still suck!&quot; and indeed they do!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Unlike what many reviewers are saying, this could be a movie that anyone can enjoy.  It's all in the approach.  The story is minimal; the humor is understated, and the dialogue is sparse.  It is not a movie for the head, but for the heart.  If you have ever felt confused about life, or if you ever felt alienation and yearned for connection, or if you ever wondered about your place in this world, then GUARANTEED you will indentify with one or both of the main characters.     It's all in the mindset.  Watch it alone if necessary.  Give this movie a chance, and you will be rewarded.  That final encounter is one of the greatest moments in recent film.
B000001FSR|4.0|I'm a fairly recent convert to Tom Waits - my best friend gave me &quot;Alice&quot; for my birthday last summer, and although it initially horrified and repulsed me, I couldn't stop listening to it for months. After the first week or two, though, I realized &quot;Alice&quot; was destined to become one of my favorite albums and Waits one of my favorite musicians. And so it's continued.<br />I've listened to about half of Waits' catalog now, spanning his earliest to latest work, and I have my own favorites. I love each of his different 'periods' in different ways. Yet somehow, I've found &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot; his hardest album to penetrate so far. Part of the problem lies in the fact it was never intended as just an album - it's the score to a stageplay. So is &quot;Alice,&quot; but at least with that one, you know everything connects (albeit peripherally) back to Lewis Carroll's story. With &quot;Frank,&quot; it really feels like we need to know the story to understand the songs. Much of what Waits sings, especially in-character as Frank, is unusual and hard to listen to without giving it your full attention. This isn't a good album for putting on after a long, hard day, or fot a late-night drive in your car. It takes more dedication than that!<br />That said, there are some gems here: &quot;Yesterday is Here&quot; and &quot;Cold Cold Ground&quot; are both excellent; &quot;Temptation&quot; (despite Waits reaching the ear-splitting high end of his range) and &quot;Telephone Call to Istanbul&quot; are pretty good, too. I've got to say, though, that &quot;Innocent When You Dream (78)&quot; is one of Waits' best and most absolutely heartbreaking songs. For that alone, the CD is worth it to me. &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot; isn't the easiest Waits to get into, but it's a great challenge if you're already a fan.
B000078DOI|5.0|Sad...This is one of the greatest albums period, and this band has COMPLETELY gone to garbage...a pure example of the death of a band...
0385505833|1.0|Annoying story, annoying characters, annoying waste of money.<br />Skipping this book would have been a better move.........
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Before I saw the movie, many of my friends tried to covinse me that this movie was the worst of the 3, and the the ending &quot;both sucked and blowed.&quot; Thankfully, they were wrong. I think that the movie was horribly hyped, and through word of mouth became, supposedly, more disappointing than the Star Wars prequels(thank God the original trilogy is being released on DVD). <br />This final battle for the human race follows the story of Neo as he finds that his arch-enemy, Smith, has taken control of the Matrix and even poses a threat to the real world. In a desparete act to save the world, he must travel to the very center of the machines' city. Meanwhile, Morpheaus and crew try desperatly to reach the dock of Zion before the entire city is flooded with Sentinals. <br />The reason people didn't except the movie as anticipated was because the ending wasn't nessesarily the 'hero rides off into the sunset' type of ending. If people went in with a more open mind, it would have gotten many more good reviews that it got. In my opinion, this was a very deep and philisophical ending, and should be apriciated much more than it is.
B000003JBJ|5.0|Perhapes not since none of the material here has the least bit of improvising...sort of.But this is a fine early 1980's<BR>channeling of the funk-fusion sounds of Roy Ayers,Lenny White,<BR>Herbie Hancock,George Duke and Patrice Rushen-all given that<BR>hazy smoothness that ONLY Incognito have been able to dish out.<BR>Actually this album doesn't sound all that different from some<BR>of the bands newer albums such as the excellent &quot;No Time Like The<BR>Future&quot; but the production is far lesser and the vocals and instrumentation alot sparser.Jean-Paul Maunick is apparently singing on some of the songs such as the dreamy &quot;Smile Of A Child&quot;.However it's apparent his voice could be stronger,but at least he's honest-I can respect that in a singer more then showing off for the sake of it.But on &quot;Shine On&quot; and &quot;Incognito&quot;<BR>the band deliver fine,dancable lite funk in the finest tradition<BR>of the term.And on &quot;Interferance&quot; Incognito are SCORCHING as they<BR>they indulge in some SERIOUS jammin' on the one on a burning<BR>disco-funk jam.If you are interested in listening to this bands<BR>music or discovering the earliest roots of todays acid jazz or<BR>simply enjoy jazz-funk music (Nigel Hall I'm talking to YOU!!!&quot;<BR>then you've gotta' have this!!!!
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is truely one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time. Written in third person, Sabriel tells the story of a yong woman named Sabriel who is blessed with the powers of charter magic and necromancy. Born in the Old Kingdom, a land of magic and mystery much like Europe in the middle ages, and forced in to the post 1920's country of Ancelstierre, she leads an unusual life living at a small school not far from a powerful barrier the separates the two worlds. Soon after discovering that her father, the Abhorsen, has either been captured or killed, Sabriel leaves her home in Ancelstierre and sets out on a quest to rescue him in her homeland. Unknown to her, dark powers controlled by a new found menace named Kerrigor threaten to destroy not only the Old Kingdom, but all of Ancelstierre as well. Now Sabriel is caught in a war of unimaginable powers,and the only things that can stop it are the majestic bells that she wears around her neck. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone over twelve years of age who enjoys an excellent detail saturated heart stopping page turner.
B00005JMSE|3.0|One of the better Marvel Comic / Movie crossovers of late with a powerhouse performance by Ron Perlman in the title role, who delivers the character which such panache, you can forgive the other disappointing aspects of the movie. A typical pulp storyline finds the birth of Hellboy by a Nazi ritual interuppted by well to do professor figure who he comes to know as father, and then we are moved hence 60 odd years. Hellboy is now on our side thankfully, but we are then only to find (shock horror) that the original protagonists have re-emerged to finish their aim of World destruction yada yada yada. Top heavy on the SfX as you would expect, but the success lies in the movies persistent, and almost self effacing script; that refuses to try and overlay a topical, or politically correct message, as so many other movies of the genre have in the past. The film seems to know it's implausible and often silly beyond belief, but the acting is perfectly executed. Any moments of stale screen time are soon enlivened with some beautifully delivered lines, again by Perlman, who almost single handedly carries the whole picture. A lot of fun here for young and old, and should appeal to those outside the 14-22 demographic for whom it seems to have been intended for by the director. Your intellect won't be tested too much, but if you know that going in, you should enjoy this movie. Deserves 3.5 stars, but not quite 4.
B000099T2L|1.0|There are few artists in the music industry that have been the subject of such intense hype - in this respect, Beyonce is in a class all by herself.  Her record label, along with mass media outlets, made Destiny's Child seem like the second coming from the moment their debut album was released - apparently the listening public bought into this but I personally didn't hear anything from them that hadn't already been done by 702, SWV, and more importantly, Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes.<br />This is the debut solo release from Beyonce Knowles, diva extraordinaire, and it hasn't even come close to justifying all the hype that has surrounded its release.  The first single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; drives a tired horn sample into the ground (whatever happened to using live instrumentation?) juxtaposed with an irritating, repetitive chorus that Beyonce only talks her way through - Jay-Z might state that it's &quot;history in the making&quot; but I don't buy it for a second.  Then we have &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, which has some dopey cringe-inducing lyrics and a shameless cop of Donna Summer's &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;.  Then, in the track that follows, &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, we get more uninspired lyrics - Beyonce yearns for the child that she sees in her dreams and thinks about all the time over a lifeless pseudo-sitar hook (popularized by Missy Elliott - does Beyonce have any original ideas in her head?).  After this, the album falls into slow jams with comatose arrangements and all the passion and energy of a snail, not to mention overwrought vocals from Beyonce (doesn't anyone know the meaning of restraint these days?).  Maybe I was expecting too much, but all the publicity that this album received set me up for something greater than what I heard.<br />In summary: A disappointing debut from the ubiquitous Beyonce.  She does have talent, but isn't applying it correctly - she needs to utilize better control over her voice and while her attempts at songwriting are admirable, they're also weak ... perhaps she should turn to outside songwriters for stronger material.  There's better stuff out there - the hype for this album turned out to be hollow.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Why was this movie even made?  It contributed little plot development to the Star Wars universe.  Lucas could have taken all the important stuff in Phantom and added an extra half hour to Attack of the Clones instead.  That way we would have been spared the lacking plot, the throw-away characters, and the bad acting.<br />The plot was really lacking.  It is a nice, Sunday-afternoon kind of movie, but that isn't what a Star Wars movie is supposed to be.  This movie was great for the kiddies, especially with Jake Lloyd's whining, Jar Jar's antics and the droids, but it left the adult audience disappointed and unsatisfied.  There was a lot of action, but no real suspense or complexity.  Even the attempts at misdirection were thinly veiled.  <br />Three characters stood out an throw-aways:  Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, and Aurra Sing.  Out of the three, Qui-Gon got the most mileage as the driving force behind a majority of the movie's plot.  I understand why Qui-Gon was used the way he was, but that doesn't mean it was the only or the best way to further that aspect of the story.  Darth Maul, who was a nice mysterious villain, was painfully underused and dispatched rather easily.  This limited the impact he could have had on the story.  As for Aurra Sing, there was a lot of press about her prior to the release, but I can't remember if she made the final cut of the movie.  <br />The acting, or lack there of, spoke for itself.  While Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Liam Neeson were great; they were over shadowed by the poor acting of Jake Lloyd and the incessant banter of Jar Jar.  <br />The best part of the movie was the way it looked.  ILM did a masterful job with the special effects.  The ships were cool and the scenery was beautiful.  Even though \\"the look\\" is very important to the Star Wars universe, it's bad when then special effects stand out more than the plot.
B000002UAC|5.0|Yes &quot;With The Beatles&quot; is (like everything else in the<BR>Fab Four's catalog&quot; is a hands down classic.But what makes this<BR>album special is Lennon/McCartney's early channeling of vintage<BR>Motown,show tunes and British skiffle into an enthusiastic fusion<BR>of rocking beats and hard rhythm and blues.&quot;All My Loving&quot; even has some similarities to old Tin Pan Alley tunes and the old<BR>standard &quot;'Til There Was You&quot; is given the doo-wop treatment.But<BR>it's John Lennon's explosive take on Barrety Strong's &quot;Money&quot;<BR>that just tares the house down  in fine &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; style.<BR>So why would this inspire a mainia consisting largly of teenagers?First of all because these four had fun,lively personality's that came off in their music and because they made<BR>the music their parents or older siblings listen to sound hip and<BR>cool to them.And that,my friends,is why The Beatles are such an<BR>important and mabye over anylyzed group and why I'm so sad that<BR>because of two deaths these guys will never come back together.<BR>WE NEED THE CULTURAL STIMULATION!!!!!!!!
B0000TLA9G|1.0|if you didnt buy this, they may actually have to release an actual album. how ridiculous, if you own appetite, why would you buy this?
B00005JMEW|4.0|From the opening credits this film is more launched than introduced to the audience and doesn't really let up until the last tantalizing (go the the sequel) scene. Like the incredibly succesful Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Kill Bill was filmed all in one go, and originally intended as a single movie, (which would probably have been overlong).Being cleverly split into two volumes,the film flows incredibly well with solid continuity, but even more cleverly is the short 4 month gap between Vol 1 on DVD and the Vol 2 in theaters idea, to keep the film fresh, and the fans interested. It's difficult to use words like &quot;classic&quot; when describing Tarantino, but love him or hate him, you have to admire this piece of work which is certainly on a par with Pulp Fiction. One wonders whether the bankability of Tarantino's name is enough to draw an audience alone regardless of the material, without the added bonus of the viewer almost knowing what to expect before they walk into the movie theater. This must surely gives him the luxury of a virtually free hand in the creativity of the plot, characters, and the action, in fairly safe comfort of the knowledge that the picture will be well received. Kill Bill is a simple revenge story, and a pastiche homage to a slew of film genres, most notably the dubbed Kung Fu action movies of the 70's. From the cheesy Raymond Chow style movie credits to the breathtaking choreography, many in the know have even recognised the juxtaposition of individual scenes, from previous Chinese classics. The film is gloriously over the top, but not overacted. There is a strange reassurance to the strength of the lead performances, playing with such dead pan sincerity, amidst even the most farcical elements of the film, and the end result is a real treat. As usual the movie is littered with expletives, and whereas the violence content button seems to have gone into overdrive, the almost astral exaggeration of the fight and blood letting sequences, actually re-emphasise the fantasy of it all. It is extremely doubtful that this film would have had much success, or even exposure without Tarantinos credentials, but as it is, it's a great experience for fans and newcomers alike - sure to be a hit with Vol 2 already in Theaters.ly re-emphasise the fantasy of it all. It is extremely doubtful that this film would have had much success, or even exposure without Tarantinos credentials, but as it is, it's a great experience for fans and newcomers alike - sure to be a hit with Vol 2 already in Theaters.
B00008PX8P|5.0|i am 22 years old and I didn't even like led zep before watching this dvd to be honest i like modern rock and i just bought it for stairway to heaven, and the first 10 times i just played that song and then i took it off, but one bored day i decided to give it all a try and i was blown away by it, and i realized that there is much more to them than stairway, for instance whole lotta love, immigrant song, black dog, since i've been loving you , bring it home, over the hills, etc.  i can honestly say now that this is the best band in the world ever!!!!! no questions asked the best live band ever, after whatching this dvd i got more into classic rock and i got all kinds of dvds from the stones, the who, clapton, santana etc and no band stands close to them. page is the best guitar player with hendrix, van halen  ,clapton, and beck, and slash no quiestions asked, and bonzo is the best drummer ever, the same goes for plant, and jones such a complete musician, on bass keyboards  and mandolin, i just wish i was around in those times to see them live .
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This album to me is by far the best I've heard this year. I was not disappointed when I bought this album but ti was fantastic and had a new feel that I really began to be obsessed with. I couldn't stop listening to this CD.I put it on 24/7!! Like I said on my review on her Cd S0ngle of Left Outside Alone. Buy this great album. ANd you will definitely NOT find this kind of album anywhere. And full of passion as well. WHich is why the CD was so enjoyable to listen to. Bye for now!
B0001DI0FI|3.0|Very quickly, I was disappointed that the special edition doesn't have any additional voice over commentary tracks.  If I could do it over again, I'd save the money and get the simple version.  The map and booklet aren't worth the extra money.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I am Definitely NOT a country music fan.  Never have been, never will be (I think so?).  I am into alternative, indie music like White Stripes, PJ Harvey, U2 etc.  But this album blew me away and I had to buy it as soon as I heard half of track 1, while the CD was playing in a Used CD store.  Cash was a true bad-ass and has such a magnetic personality and I wish I was a kid back in his prime in the 1960's.  Since I'm 27, I missed most of his career though not before he covered the song 'Hurt' in the excellent Video from 2 years ago.  This CD is so powerful and really attests to the charisma of Cash.  I love his interaction with the Prison crowd as the inmates take a quick liking to one who was in their shows for a while.-------------------One of the Top 10 CD's I own!!-------Its THE BEST!!
B00007BH5C|3.0|An overrated soundtrack.  I didn't care much for the Fellowship or the Return of the King, but the Two Towers is the worst of the bunch.  I suppose fans of the movie will appreciate this CD, but it's just not a very good soundtrack.  Boring, tenuous vocals, cliched, blah, blah.  For those interested in really good soundtracks, go pick up a copy of Ennio Morricone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, Bernard Hermann's VERTIGO, or ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS...SIGNATURES IN SUSPENSE.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Master and Commander-The Far Side of the World is a fantastic movie in so many ways. There are so many things that make it great and the flaws are few.<br />In Master and Commander we have Captian \\"Lucky Jack Aubrey. He has been given orders by the British empire to take down the French privateer Acheron. After a sneak attack by the French it's up to Jack to strike back. The ship needs repair and morale is low. He will also find himself torn between duty and friendship as he tries to fulfill his commands and stay true to himself.<br />Russel Crowe is the man. He is easily one of the greatest actors still in the business today. He plays Jack Aubrey to perfection. Russel Crowe lives the part and becomes the character and he does that in this movie. He is simply amazing and I love watching this guy on the big screen. In almost any other year Crowe probaly would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this performance. It is that good.<br />Paul Bettany is great as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He displays human emotions very well. It's a great character and he plays it very well. Like Crowe his performance is good enough for an academy nomination and in almost any other year and he would have gotten one.<br />Peter Weir has directed a cinematic masterpiece. Not since Steven Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan has a war movie had such detail put into it. Everything looks great in the film. The sets are real and authenic. The costumes are great. All the little details are great. They used real ships and filmed this in the tank that was made for Titanic. Mad props have to be given to Weir for the dedication and work he put into the film.<br />The one flaw that can be said about the movie is it is slow in places. The friendship between Aubrey and the Doctor does drag in places and they did go a little far with some of the character development. We don't need to learn as much as we did with some of the side characters. They don't do really do anything to enhance the plot of the movie at all.<br />One problem this movie had was the success of Pirates of the Carribean. Far to many people went to this film expecting to see something like  that. Instead of a comedy you get a pretty serious war-action-drama movie. The comedic points are low and most of them are based out of irony. Far to many people expected Pirates and knocked the film because of it.<br />The film was nominated for 10 academy awards. The two big ones were nominatons for \\"Best Picture\\" and \\"Best Director.\\" It won for Best Sound and Best Cinematograpy. It's a pretty big statement when a movie gets this much academy attention. It would have won more if it hadn't been for Return of the King.<br />This is a great film. It's slow in places but is well worth it. It's a beautiful made movie and I'm glad I own it. It's enjoyable and I recommend it to all.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The soundtrack is nothing less than you would expect from the movie. The style is eclectic, ranging from the 5, 6, 7, 8s (50s style surf music in Japanese) two Nancy Sinatra. The cd also includes to monlogues. First when O-Ren Ishii speaks to her council, and another from the Bride to Sophie Fatale. The last few tracks are sound effects from the movie such as swordfights. An excellent cd that anyone with an eclectic style can appreciate.
0876855575|5.0|Ham on Rye is based around the troubles that go along with growing up, in the normal blunt, coarse Bukowski way. The main character, Henry Chinaski, is abused by his father and has trouble fitting in with the guys at school. This book tells it how it is growing up and expirementing and all the difficulties that come along with it. Bukowski talks about what the reader wants to read about. The book is not sugar-coated and tells about what really gets talked about and remembered from the school years. The writing style is very interesting and different, sometimes with sentence fragments and two-page chapters. The reader really gets into the anti-American outcast mindset of the main character. This book would appeal to most males 15-up.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is an amazing album that is well worth the money.  It is arguably one of the top albums of the 90's.  The blue album set the standard for most of the geek rock/emo bands out today.  This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to from start to finish without wanting to pause or skip a track.  You can easily listen to this over and over.  It has great opening with My Name is Jonas and ends softly with Only in dreams.  Only in dreams is one of those songs you just need to play loud, sit back, listen and enjoy.  Other standout tracks include in the garage, holiday, undone, hell the entire album.
B00005221L|5.0|Predator is such a fantastic action sci-fi thriller. It's a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and it's one of the reasons he is where is today.<br />The plot to Predator is simple enough to follow. Dutch(Schwarzenegger) has been called by Dillon(Weathers) to go to South America and find some missing officials. Dutch takes his squad of elite troops and he does just that. What they find though is skinned bodies of American troops. Slowly Dutch begins to lose his men until it becomes a mission of trying to get out of the jungle alive.<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is simply fantastic in this film. This is one of the best action films he has ever made. When him and the predator go one on one it's awesome. It's truly clash of the titans as the warriors fight. Arnold is an absolute beast in the film. He's cut and huge and this movie took place during his stretch of hit movies that he had in the late 1980's. This movie helped make him the household name that he is today.<br />I liked Carl Weathers in this film. All people ever recognize this guy for is Apollo Creed in Rocky. After seeing him arm wrestle Arnold in the film you really recognize what kind of peak condition this guy was in at one point. I like Carl Weahters a lot and his role in Predator is great.<br />The rest of Arnolds team is full of plenty of guys that you see in a lot of his 80's movies. The most recognizable guy from his squad is former Gov. Jesse Ventura. The squad is casted perfectly as is this movie.<br />John McTiernan has to get a lot of credit for the success of this movie. This is a very well made movie. I love what he did with the Predator in the film. You don't get to see to much of the Predator until it squares off against Arnold. So like Spielberg did in Jaws you let the suspense of the creature scare you. McTiernan does that to perfection. He baits you a little bit by showing you some of the Predator but it's just enough to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat. He also shot his movie beautifully on location in South America.<br />This really is a well made movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way until the end. It's a great sci-fi thriller and can be argued as the best of all time. You can't be a serious Arnold fan without seeing this picture. You can't really call yourself I sci-fi fan if you havn't seen it either. Go pick Predator up you won't regret it. Now Predator 2, thats an entire different story.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|well, I have listened to various song clips and heard her stuff and listening parties, and seen both of her recent videos.  I have always been a fan of true music, and I have always dissed Britney Spears.  I don't feel bad, because her self-image is horrible, and she doesn't seem all too friendly herslef.  She is media-conscience, and about the only thing she gets one star for is her amazin, yet provocativly sexual dance moves........the album is just weird.  It sounds funky, and it doesn't sound to me like she is the least bit singer/songwriter.......oh well.......to all of you Britney fans out there, my best friend is a die=hard, so nothing against you.  She is good at what she does, but what she does has never appealed to me, so sorry I had to put it that way.  But you will definetely NOT see me buying her album online or in stores and supporting her sales!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this show just sucks you in with its amazing acting, plot, action, comedy just every thing. it is so original and has everything anyone could want in a show i dont know why it got cut off the air when lowsy startrek gets how many years and gets there own obsesed crowd of &quot;trekys&quot; why doesnt a show ten times better than that get there own obsesed group? ppl really need to give it a chance and they will find a show better than any other ever made!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I can understand being disappointed by Revolutions, if you didn't pick up on the deliberate choice of words and names from the first and second movies: Morpheus, the name of his ship, Neo, Anderson, Trinity, Daniels House of Dream Interpretation, etc. If these all make sense to you, then you already know how this movie will end, and the biggest disappointment will be the fact that &quot;Death&quot; (aka Smith, played by Hugo Weaving) and Neo's big fight is just boring to watch. Then again, I guess it's better than 40 days in the desert. They're all set up for the next movie to be called &quot;Matrix Revelation.&quot; I enjoyed the movie because of the parallels, and because I could see where they were going.<br />On the other hand, if you didn't get any of the above, which it appears to me most reviewers don't, then you might as well take the blue pill, or better yet, go read a good book. This movie is chock full of inside references, both to mythology and to established religions. If you don't get any of those references, you'll be one of the bitter and disappointed viewers who don't understand why the ending turned out the way it is.
B0000024JN|5.0|I just discovered the Beastie Boys and I don't regret my purchase! Licensed to ill is one of the most cool albums that have been released by Def Jam records (with It takes a nation of million to hold us back from Public Enemy also a big classic!) what I like from the Beastie Boys is that their attitude isn't gangsta' one but a party one! They don't really care about Gettho'problems but they do care to have a drink and have fun!
0671027344|4.0|&quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; is a book written in the voice of a highschool social outcast, Charlie, through letters to an anonymous &quot;friend&quot;. Throughout the book, Charlie comes out of his shell, makes a few friends, and finds out about a devastating secret about his Aunt Helen. Charlie's views on life, love, and relationships can relate to the readers. His honest thoughts and ideas make the reader think twice. The author, Stephen Chbosky, makes Charlie come alive with his simple, truthful, and easy to read style of writing. Chbosky has a way of taking ideas that I have had myself and putting them into words that almost any reader can connect with. &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; is probably best for readers 13 and up.
B00009V7RF|2.0|B.E.P has always represented progressive, fun and entertaining hip hop. They were part of the later day alt rap/native tongue influenced music with groups like The Roots, Jurassic 5, Blackstar, and Slum Village. Will.I.Am headed the group in this direction with his constantly evolving production style and distinct strong rapping skills. With this album their style evolves even further. I do not believe it has evolved in a positive direction though. Newly added member Fergie adds a yoko factor to me. She puts forth her often annoying singing to many songs diluting what might have remained dopeness intact. The beats are imaginative, some occasions I feel they lack something though. On the microphone Will, Taboo and Apl.De.Ap are only concerned with having a good time for the most part. I'm a firm believer that hip hop can be fun but I would like to hear a little more variety. Maybe some social conscious rhymes, more battle rhymes, and just more varied concepts. Although Fergie is mostly unwelcomed she can be ok when she doesn't try and over-sing and the guys do come fairly solid lyrically, so it isn't all bad. A few spots on the album save it from really being an average disaster but not a whole lot. Now I'll get into the songs...<br />Hands Up ~ Opens the whole feel of the album in general with a rather strong note. All four members show up to get the crowd live. Wills opening verse is by far the best where he quickens his flow up trump tight. He also produces a bombass beat. It is set around a horn loop that reminds me of Batman, hard drum and bass, with a guitar change up at the hook. The hook it's self is an effective chant calling you to get your hands up. Solid party jam.<br />Shut Up ~ This is the worst track on the album. Due mainly in part to Fergie's annoying as hell singing, she sounds like dime store harlot. The production by Will is some guitar riffs that aren't anything to write home about. Will and Apl both drop verses about relationships but Will's first verse si actually pretty bad but when he's talking back and forth with Fergie adlibbing she puts on some accent and it's downright sickening.<br />The Apl Song ~ When B.E.P's creativity works it works really well. This is Apl's solo cut which is a heartfelt ode to his homeland of the Philippines and his struggles of returning home after so long. The chorus is in Filipino and I don't understand what si being said but it's all butter, The musical sound scape provided by Will.I.Am and Apl himself is nice and laidback which is a kool change of pace using playful guitar and nice moog. A Black Eyed Peas classic to me.<br />Where Is The Love? Ft/ Justin Timberlake ~ Finally Black Eyed gets socially conscious and brings something a little different from the electro-funk party tracks of most of the album. Taboo and Apl have the best verses lyrically. Justin's high pitched singing is a nice change from Fergie. The production is great using many layers of electric guitar, moog, horns, violins, bass and acoustic guitar. (The LP version is extended extra long and the beat changes to a practically different song with different production and Justin Timberlake disappears, Will and Fergie take over)<br />This album tried to be a solid party album in a stressful time and for that I commend them because it is a valiant effort. Unfortunately it takes a lot of skill to make a lot of the same thing sound good. Although B.E.P has tons of skill they just couldn't pull it off as good as others might be able to. I think they should just try varying the concepts of the raps and change up the tempo every so often. I think they should also ditch Fergie because well they can do better, bring back Kim Hill so they can have that added singing touch but with someone who can actually sing. 2.5 stars, while it's not all bad I don't believe there is enough to warrant a buy rating. Only for pop heads, collectors and undiscriminating fans. Peace, love &amp; soul...

0618526412|5.0|Thank you, Oprah! I read this book as a college freshman in 1976 and still remember its startlingly honest, quietly devestating portrait of five women from a small Southern town and how, despite their individual loneliness, they fail to connect. Written when McCullers was only 23, it was the emotional and intellectual touchstone for all her other works. Still a pleasure to read and new generations of women will be mezmerized. My other two favorite recent books: \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, an amazingly funny and fresh memoir about marriage, manhoood, love, career, parenting and juggling. And \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books,\\" by Azar Nafisi, an immensely moving portrait of the power of words and books in a closed society (and how we take books for granted).
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Best CD I've heard since her last one!
B0000D96NW|4.0|Originally 4 stars, I am upping it to 5 stars.  This album just gets better with age.    This is a great album.  Not at any point in time have I been blown away by Machine Head, album wise.  Even Burn My Eyes was a pretty good album at best.  My main gripe with that album was its production and too many Biohazard-isms.  It was their live shows that always did me in.  Probably the most brutal show I have been to.  Check them out live.    As far as TTAOE.  There are some absolute gems on this album.  This is their best album.  Good production, good riffage, and the best solos Machine Head has ever done.  The standout tracks are Imperium, Elegy, Vim, Season Wither and All Falls Down.  I feel privileged for once to be in America to be able to get an  excellent extra track, such as Seasons Wither.  Usually every other continent gets this benefit, but damn its good.  There are some weakpoints, but nothing too big.  Overall, it has DEFINITELY made me rethink Machine Head.  BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|I would disagree with many who would say that this is one of Miyzazaki's best works.  Nausicaa is not a bad movie, but it is most certainly not Miyazaki's best movie.  It possesses many of the traits that many have come to love in Miyazaki's movies: fantastic worlds, original creatures, real people.  However, nothing seems to work as well in this early work.  The bizarre creatures and plants would be more at home in a B-movie sci-fi flick; they seem more silly than enchanting.  The character will seem to be very similar to the familiar characters of Miyazaki's later movies, but they seem to have less depth than other Miyazaki's movies.  The strong-willed princess seems less a human being and more an archetype.  The villains do not possess the same kind of human quality that other Miyazaki villains have; they are just leering vicious, two-dimensional bullies.  Similarly the moral lessons lose any kind of impact because they demonstrate a black and white attitude to the subject manner, and furthermore the whole environment has been created as a contrivance to validate the moral argument.  How is one supposed to take a lesson about conservation to heart when the deck is blatantly stacked to prove the point.  Princess Mononoke succeeded in its message because it showed, in addition to the importance of nature, how human technology and progress can help people when used with sound judgement.  Lady Eboshi who led the forces of Irontown was far more human than the villainess in Nausicaa.  Princess Mononoke showed that there are no easy answers.  Overall I believe that Nausicaa should be seen as nothing more than an early work by Miyazaki; a prototype for the Princess Mononoke masterpiece that would succeed in every way that Nausicaa failed.
B00006879E|5.0|Hey, this cd is very catchy overall is a great selection of tunes odds are, if you are looking into purchasing this item you have heard the 1st 2 songs on the cd which of course are Harder To Breath and This Love, so i'll skip over rating them seeing as how you've probably already formulated your oppinion so as for the rest 5/5 being the best:<br />Shiver- takes a while to grow on you but it does 3.5/5 <BR>She Will Be Loved-4.5/5<BR>Tangled- grows on you more and more as you play it 5/5<BR>The Sun -4.5/5 grows on you more as you play it<BR>Must Get Out-5/5 this song makes me feel sad for some reason, I guess it's because he sounds sad when he sings it but it is one of my favorite songs on the album<BR>Sunday Morning-4/5 pretty good<BR>Secret-4.5/5 again grows on you more as you play it, it has a very seductive sound to it<BR>Through With You-5/5 definantly another favorite one of mine on this cd very catchy tune, I really like it<BR>Not Coming Home-5/5 again, great tune catchy I love it another favorite<BR>Sweetest Goodbye-5/5 great tune, again, another favorite<br />I gave this cd 5 stars because I can easily listen to it without skipping over songs this is a worthy purchase.
B000002GY9|5.0|Hmm... from the opening stretches of piano &amp; strings in &quot;Tom Trauberts Blues&quot; to the wrap-up of &quot;I Can't Wait to Get Off Work&quot; this cd is a masterful example of musical storytelling.  The character meeting his demise in the title song, the man flipping his quarter while leaning on his lampost, the drunken piano man blaming everyone else, just gorgeous.  I believe that this album came out the month I was born as well.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is a great record.  I'm not sure why there are so many hostile Duran Duran haters on Amazon.  If there is a criticism, it's that Rio isn't as groundbreaking as some might believe.  They \\"borrowed\\" the musical sound from Roxy Music's Country Life.  Just listen to \\"Out Of The Blue\\" next to \\"Save A Prayer\\".  It's almost note for note.  They also lifted a lot from Japan, especially their \\"Quiet Life\\" album.  Simon Lebon and David Sylvian could almost be the same singer.  Those criticisms aside, Rio is a lot catchier and more immediate than Country Life and Quiet Life.  The songwriting is fantastic.  The music is brilliant.  The lyrics are tolerable.  It's hard to find a better album from the 80s or ANY time period.
B000089RVX|1.0|They're a complete and utter rip-off of Nightwish. And, like another poster mentioned, they ripped off various nu-metal bands...but who cares about nu-metal? Anyways, check out Nightwish in the link above; and/or, check out Lacuna Coil above. They're both great bands. :)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Is Britneys Best Album Yet...She has definetly matured lyrically.

B00009V7RF|3.0|The Black Eyed Peas have been on the scene longer than one would expect.  They charmed smaller circles before and achieved some popularity with &quot;Request + Line,&quot; their collaboration with Macy Gray.  An image revamp and a dreadfully fine-looking blonde later, suddenly they are the hottest group to hit the waves.  Fergie, the new addition, does not only make the group easy on the eyes but also adds enough vocals to make them sound less like an imposter Tribe Called Quest.<br />However, the music has become more manufactured and radio-ready.  For example, the first single, &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; is a hit too big for its own good, with a schmaltzy chorus sung by non-other than current poster-boy Justin Timberlake.  The other hit, &quot;Shut Up,&quot; starts on a good note but is then overwhelmed by its catchphrase.<br />The real star on Elephunk is &quot;Hey Mama,&quot; a true dance number with enough dazzle to keep everyone shaking after many spins.  The bass arrangement on that track alone deserves its own award.<br />Fergie shines on &quot;The Boogie That Be&quot; and &quot;Fly Away.\\"  Papa Roach helps out with the only rock track on Elephunk, titled &quot;Anxiety.&quot;  The rest of the tracks fall short of even mediocre, like the disturbing &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; and the pointless &quot;Labor Day (It's A Holiday).&quot;  Moreover, the summer-y &quot;Latin Girls&quot; is a genuine nag.<br />Elephunk carries hits and misses.  However, downloading the songs will save you some hard-earned cash.  The reconstruction of the band makes them more presentable and creates a niche for them in the pop market, but they still need to create a more complete record to earn some credibility.
0671027344|5.0|Alright guys..everyone on here except for the one guy thought it was amzing so take our word for it. I can connect with Charlie so much. He said that he seemed to wise for his age, yet my friends are like his and I think like him. Maybe in the ninetys things didnt seem like that and teenagers didnt think like that but I definitely do. I never really liked reading but this book had me hooked, im actually upset that its over. I loved it so much. You get so close to the characters you dont want to leave them. Charlie is someone i would definitely wanted to know. He reminds me of someone, someone I can totally understand. This book is too good for words. Best book ive ever read. It gives you knew aspects and theway Charlie thinks is so deep, nothing i would have expected to find at my school library. So read it!!
B000000993|5.0|After their short 6 song debut CD \\"Opiate\\", Tool got the exposure they needed to come up with Undertow, my favorite of the four Tool CD's.<br />Definitely rock, Undertow is still a moodier, mellower CD than the thrash and head-banging I usually listen to, but pure and true to fans of the rock genre.  Released in 1993, Tool's Undertow was part of the refining process that brought metal back from the grips of the measured and more sorrow-ridden grunge tracks that grew out of the 80's.<br />Melancholy and darker than their later works, with a touch of the de-tuning that Korn brought out of the closet for our metal-listening pleasure, Tool was smack dab in the middle of the 90's rebirth of rock and metal. This is one of my favorites for just kickin back and relaxing, nice background for reading, writing, or hot-tubbing.<br />My favorite song would have to be Sober, which is a little mellower than the rest of the songs but has such a catchy melody that it seems to be the one that sticks in my head the longest.  Prison Sex and Intolerance are also catchy, thrumming tunes; while Swamp Song and Flood are the darkest and moodiest of the collection.  Surprisingly, the song the CD was titled after, Undertow, is not a favorite.  It just seems to lack the life that Maynard James Keenan pumps into the rest of the tracks.<br />Disgustipated seems to have two faces, on some of the comments I have seen it has long drawn out silences, but on my CD it wound out being only one second of silence and that's it; so I really don't have any comments on that particular track.<br />All in all, Tool's Undertow is a piece I consider a \\"must have\\" mood CD for those times when you are feeling a bit bleak and depressed, but not ready to give up the fight just yet.  Enjoy!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Just buy it because you know all of the songs and can make your husband crazy singing them all out of tune in the car...
B0001IN07Q|3.0|I agree with many other reviews--I am a huge Michael Buble fan and just recently had the pleasure of seeing him live in concert this past month in Solana Beach, Calif--he was fantastic as was his band--I love the new songs on the CD and was willing to buy it, even with the repeat of the songs that were on his other CD, and was really hoping to see a DVD that reminded me of his terrific performance in concert--instead the constant cuts/editing provided so much visual distraction that it was impossible to enjoy his great voice, the great band and the wonderful songs--I will listen to the CD and dump the DVD.  Michael, or his DVD producers, or whoever controlled the final DVD decisions should have watched Diana Krall's concert DVD or one by Tony Bennett or so many other great performers of great songs--let's enjoy the music and not try to impress with some MTV-style video production.<br />I sure hope to see another Michael Buble DVD done correctly in the future--hope this hasn't turned off too many fans, as Michael is the real deal--a great voice with a great future!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Not only do I STRONGLY suggest you buy this amazing album, I also suggest you see Gavin in concert. His concert was BY FAR the best concert I have ever been to because he sings better live than he does on the album. And the album is great!
B00004T9UF|5.0|The CD has awesome hits like &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, and &quot;Stan&quot;. This is my favorite Eminem CD out of all of them.<br />1.

Stan - 5/5 A great song about his biggest fan, Stan...<BR>4. Paul (skit) - 2/5 A very short and pointless skit.<BR>5. Who Knew - 3.7/5 Don't remember what is was about but a very good song!<BR>6. Steve Berman (skit) - 4/5 All of the Steve Berman skits are great!<BR>7. The Way I Am - 5/5 The 2nd best song on here!<BR>8. The Real Slim Shady - 5/5 The BEST song from Eminem ever!!<BR>9. Remember Me - 3/5 It's OK... has many disadvantages.<BR>10. I'm Back - 4/5 Eminem is back!<BR>11. Marshall Mathers - 3/5 It's average, I just don't like the lyrics and beats... kinda boring.<BR>12. Ken Kaniff (skit) - 2/5 The worst skit on the CD!<BR>13. Drug Ballad - 5/5 A VERY good song... I LOVE the lyrics!<BR>14. Amityville - 2.7/5 Worst song on the CD, VERY disappointing.<BR>15. B*tch Please II - 5/5 This one is one of my favorites! D12 rules!<BR>16. Kim - 3.5/5 A song about killing his wife, Kim... an OK to average song.<BR>17. Under The Influence 4.5/5 Very Explict but still a very good song.<BR>18. Criminal - 4/5 A pretty good song... good beat, too.

B000002JS6|5.0|&quot;Back In Black&quot; is one of the most important album of our time.  It isn't full of songs charged with political statements or musings on love.  It doesn't put you in a philosophical state of mind.  What it is, though, is pure rock n' roll.  This is not your daddy's rock, it's the noisy, gnarly sound that showed everybody that rock n' roll was going to change in the 80's.<br />Three points can be made about this album that make it so important:<br />1)The conditions under which the album was made.<br />No one expected AC/DC to put out an album so strong after the death of Bon Scott, their frontman.  People expected them to fade into the history books as one of those &quot;if only Bon would have lived...&quot; bands.  Lucky for us, Mr. Scott's death only made the band stronger.  The transition between Scott and Brian Johnson is seamless and perfect.  It's the same old AC/DC but with an equally sufficient new frontman.  Though the band was going through tough times, they put out an emotionally charged rock album that is one of the best selling of all time.<br /><br />Bon Scott wasn't forgotten on this album. The story of his death is well documented, and so is the request that his mother made following it.  She wanted the band to continue because she believed that is what Bon wanted.  Thank God that AC/DC listened to her.  No other band has changed lead singers and had as little trouble or as much success as AC/DC.<br />2)The mass appeal of the album.<br />Almost everybody knows at least one song on this album, no matter what their race, religion, or musical preference is.  &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; can be heard in just about every night club in the world in one form or another.  The title track is played at some point during every sporting event around the globe.  &quot;Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; and &quot;Have A Drink On Me&quot; fall into this category as well.<br />Very few albums by one artist can claim this fact.  Granted, many groups have one or two songs that may be well known, but everybody knows about &quot;Back in Black.&quot;<br />3)It stays true to formula.<br />You may laugh at this comparison, but it's the best I can come up with:  AC/DC is to hard rock as George Strait is to country music.  Neither stray too far from their standard sound.  George Strait always puts out good honky-tonk and Texas swing.  AC/DC always puts out hard-hitting rock.  Both have hit after hit using the same formula on each album.  Most bands will attempt something new, which isn't bad, but AC/DC will always play hard rock because that is what they do best.  They could have changed their sound, especially with the addition of a new frontman, but they stuck to their guns and made an album that is what it is:  hard rock.<br />Can you name a ballad by AC/DC?  You'd be hard pressed to find one.  The band may not have moving lyrics, but they can rock.  By staying true to themselves, the band has made its mark in music history.<br />In closing, I have to say that &quot;Back In Black&quot; is crucial to any music library.  It can hold its own against any album out there.  It is just as important as any album by the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Sr., or any performer considered to be a trailblazer or legend in their respective genre.  You can scoff at me for that statement, but I believe every word of it.groups have one or two songs that may be well known, but everybody knows about &quot;Back in Black.&quot;<br />3)It stays true to formula.<br />You may laugh at this comparison, but it's the best I can come up with:  AC/DC is to hard rock as George Strait is to country music.

B00005OM4N|1.0|I honestly believe that playing an artist like Britney Spears can increase your ability to play a game like Zuma.  (It's a theory I'm testing out, do not ask.)  Of the three albums I have heard from Britney (this, In the Zone, and Oops!  I Did It Again), this is the most painful to listen to, despite producing efforts from the Neptunes on songs such as &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U.&quot;  (IMO, I like the beat, but Britney's singing is terrible on this track.)  Of all the songs on this album (including that lovely end duet with Justin Timberlake), the songs triumphantly featured on the terrible movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; are the worst: my least favorite song, Britney's cover of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll,&quot; had me longing for Joan Jett's more anarchic rendition (and remember, this song was not performed for a bunch of karaoke patrons like in the movie).  If you want to start listening to Britney Spears, this is not the album to start with.

B0001EFTTM|5.0|This is the film that got me interested in silent films and it's still one of my most favourites.  No matter how often I watch it, I'm always struck by the effectiveness of the film:  the characters, make-up, movements and some special effects which, compared to modern films may seem very primitive and crude, but when used at the right time, however, create the perfect effect.  There is also the simple matter of how Max Schreck, who plays the vampire, walks or stands, and being very tall and thin, wearing a sinister black coat, it's enough to already give you the creeps!<br />For novices to silent films I'd like to say that this film has much more depths that one might think, and you have to read the intertitles carefully to get the background or in-depth meanings that are intended.  I got much more out of the film after the second and third viewing and paying attention to both the intertitles and other details, such as how Ellen was under Nosferatu's spell from a distance, and sensed when her husband was in mortal danger in Nosferatu's castle.  There is also the interesting correlation between Nosferatu's presence and the Plague, and until science proved otherwise, people back then did believe that illnesses, especially a plague, were caused by evil, sinister beings.<br />For anyone who likes a film they can get their teeth into (pardon the pun) even if not a vampire/horror fan, this is a good one!  And as far as silent films go, definitely also in the &quot;classics&quot; department and a must-have in your collection.

B00018TI5E|3.0|...but not a masterpiece.  While I respect Frusciante's work in the RHCP, as well as his opinions on music and life in general, and I want to support him, I wouldn't say that this is a spectacular album.  It's average.  I'm glad he put it out and look forward to more, but like someone else said in a previous review, with this album, I could almost take it or leave it.  It does grow on you, however.  Except for &quot;Wednesday's Song,&quot; which - after hearing the entire album online through a promotion on Frusicante's official website - was the main reason I bought it.  This song is the best on the album both lyrically and instrumentally.  I love it.  Beyond that, here's some brief commentary on some of the songs:<br />Carvel - Frusciante sounds a bit like former Soundgarden/now Audioslave's singer Chris Cornell here, taking on a more &quot;masculine&quot; singing style than in what is heard in the back-up vocals of RHCP and the rest of the album.  he almost growls at times and also sings the back-up vocals.  one of the best songs on the album.<br />Omission - Frusciante opens the song vocally and alternates w/Klinghoffer singing lead. i'm assuming the strange, high-pitched, highly feministic background voice is Klinghoffer, since no one else is credited w/vocals (but having never heard Klinghoffer alone, it's somewhat difficult to tell) w/some of Frusciante in the background at times, as well Frusciante singing &quot;centralize the force of rot.&quot;  the ending guitar riff? (don't know the technical term for it) is reminiscient of his RHCP sound in the song &quot;Dosed&quot; <br />Regret - lots of distortion in this song and though it's extremely simple lyrically, i like what he does w/it<br />Ricky - hard to tell if Klinghoffer, Frusciante, or both are singing back-up here<br />Second Walk - upbeat <br />Every Person - opens w/what sounds like a church organ and a little piano/keyboard and guitar, then vocals; ditto on the lyrics<br />Wednesday's Song - the best on the album; i think it's mostly a song about Frusciante's former drug habit and dealing w/fame; put this one on repeat<br />This Cold - like &quot;Second Walk,&quot; another short, upbeat song and one of the better ones on the album; more of a RHCP guitar sound at the end <br />Song to Sing When I'm Lonely - relaxing ballad; just o.k.<br />In Relief - good song; nice, echoing/reverb vocals; one of the better ones<br />Water - worst song on the album; annoying<br />Cut Out - good song until the ending, high-pitched vocals; return to Carvel-like vocals at times<br />Chances - boring; skip it<br />23 go in to end - out of Failure33 Object and 00Ghost27, this one is bearable; i kinda like it; what's up w/the clandestine song titles?<br />Overall, the lyrics throughout the entire album are different and unconventional (but then when are lyrics necessarily conventional anyway?) w/no traditional choruses.  I tend to like the apparent message of the lyrics rather than the lyrics themselves.  Sometimes, like the vocals on this album, they don't seem to fit or make sense but, given Frusicante's quirkiness, this is probably just the way they should be.  Frusciante has described them as being &quot;surreal.&quot;  I agree, and the album is obviously a reflection of his own personal beliefs, feelings, and experiences.  I would dub it as autobiographical.
0792107683|5.0|&quot;Shane!  You hit him with your gun!  I hate you, Shane!&quot;<BR>       --Brandon DeWilde as Joey Starrett to Alan Ladd in SHANE.<br />SHANE is a beautiful movie.  The photography is beautiful.   The music is beautiful.  The stars--Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, Jean Arthur, Brandon DeWilde, and Jack Palance are terrific and the character actors--like Ben Johnson, Edgar Buchanan--later a star of tv's PETTICOAT JUNCTION--and Elisha Cook, Jr.--briefly much later in his life in THE NIGHT STALKER--are fantastic. The sets and the script make you feel like you're living in the Wild West of the 1800s.  <br />But even though a lot of reviewers say SHANE is a battle between good and evil, it's just the opposite:Director George Stevens shows people in situations where you can't clearly define what's right or wrong:SHANE's villains were settlers, the good guys are settlers.  Jean Arthur is a frontier woman happily married to Van Heflin as Joe Starrett, yet suddenly she falls in love with Shane.  As the movie approaches its POINT OF NO RETURN, Shane ends a fistfight with Joe Starrett by hitting Starrett on the head with his gun--with Brandon DeWilde as Starret's son Joey watching--leading to the finale where Jack Palance as Jack Wilson is a gunfighter, and Shane is a gunfighter.<br />BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL:THE ONLY ADULT WESTERN EVER MADE--SHANE!!!<br />                         Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Imagine waking each day and having no memory of anything that has happened over the past twenty-four hours, week or month.  This handicap would be more than most could bear, but add a single-minded vengeance focused on finding the murderer of your beloved wife and you have a volatile mixture for increased interest and high drama.  The driving force for bringing this unique premise to the big screen is the product of the collaborative efforts of Director Chris Nolan and Columbia Tri-Star Studios.  Their efforts in creating a story that stimulates our intellect and traps us in its' snare of plot twists for the entire duration of the movie is an achievement and makes this a must see for anyone looking for change a pace from the typical drama.  <BR>Further adding to this unique premise is the fact that the story is told in an unnatural reverse sequence; beginning with the ending, then building towards the ending again in ten minute segments.  Even though the viewer is shown the ultimate ending first, the story really becomes about why the story concluded this way and thus begins their journey with Leonard Shelby, the unfortunate amnesiac portrayed perfectly through the fine acting of Guy Pierce.  The viewer roots for Leonard due to his absolute devotion to finding his wife's killer through many of the creative efforts he utilizes to overcome his affliction.  These include the use of Polaroid pictures, many notes scribbled on various pieces of paper and from a multitude of tattoos that adorn his body along with two individuals that we, the viewers, are really never sure are supposed to serve as friend or foe to Leonard.  With all of these elements combined, this movie fulfills the role of achieving the highest excellence in film for this genre and creates a superior classic psychological drama for all to enjoy.
B000059MPH|5.0|The second lavish all-star Agatha Christie adaptation.  This is the first film with Peter Ustinov as the Belgian Detective, Hercule Poirot.  If you love a who-done-it mystery, this one will keep you thinking and stimulate your brain to the very end.  Please watch it to the very last second.  What may be so one minute may be different the next second.  This all-star cast is wonderful, especially Angela Lansbury.  Olivia Hussey, Peter ustinov and Simon Corkindale had just finished the NBC tv-miniseries movie, [[ASIN:B0000633QW Jesus of Nazareth]] (1977).  Also in the cast is Bette Davis, David Niven, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy, Maggie Smith ([[ASIN:B00005RYKZ Neil Simon's California Suite]] [1978], Jack Warden, Lois Chiles ([[ASIN:B000NIBURG Moonraker]] [1979]), Jon Finch, Jane Birkin, Harry Andrews and I.S. Johar.    Warning: This is not for children to watch.  very Grusome and graphic violence.  There are many Agatha Christie movies from film and television.  Here are some worth watching.  Those with an \\"*\\" include Peter Ustinov as \\"Detective Poirot\\".  And Then There Were None (Ten Little Indians) (1974), [[ASIN:B000BO0LLI Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express]] (1974), [[ASIN:B000059LGG The Mirror Crack'd]] (1980), [[ASIN:B001KZOVJK Evil Under the Sun]] (1982), *Thirteen At Dinner (1985-tv), *Dead Man's Folly (1986-tv), *Murder In Three Acts (1986-tv), *Appointment With Death (1988).  For a lighter mystery comedy, may I suggest [[ASIN:B00005RDRO Murder by Death]] (1976).

B00003CXCT|2.0|Picture the original trilogy as a wonderfully rich and moist, homemade chocolate cake with sweet homemade frosting; like mom used to make. (As for me, I've been moved out of the house for quite a while now, so I don't enjoy that much anymore.) <BR>Now... imagine the enhanced trilogy as a cheap off-brand cake mix. Yes it is STILL cake, and you can STILL eat it. But there's a part you(taste buds) that is left feeling unsatisfied and dissapointed because what you just experienced is definitely not what you remember or hoped for.<br />The enhanced versions are dissapointing, yet when you look at all the crappy movies being made these days, the new trilogy still beats many of them. As for original StarWars fans, this enhanced trilogy just wont cut it. <BR>For one, the originals were perfect just the way they were. Secondly, among other misfortunes, the added animations were HORRIBLE- they looked like cartoons. ex. in A New Hope -Han walking/talking with giant 'blob-o-graphics'. Yeah, I know Lucas wanted that scene, but it was done very badly. I'll be waiting impatiently for the originals (I can dream can't I...) thanks for reading -Rob

B000002UB3|5.0|This is not the best Beatle album, but I think it has to rate five stars because of some of the songs included here:  &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; George's best song ever and (to me, a young hippie at the time) the very embodiment of what it meant to be alive in 1969; the &quot;Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End&quot; trilogy that ends the last album The Beatles ever recorded and is maybe their strongest piece of heavy duty rock and roll; and &quot;Come Together,&quot; a piece of funk rock way ahead of its time that gets better and better with age.<br />I could advise you to just stick with the best and maybe go out and buy the WHITE ALBUM or SGT PEPPER instead, but this is The Beatles we're talking about here, and second best (or third best or fourth best or...) Beatles stuff is still better than nearly all the rest that's out there.<br />But I am jaded.  I think ALL of The Beatles CD's are five stars except for YELLOW SUBMARINE.  And even that one I'm still thinking about!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|A perfect example of how to make a film. Director Peter Weir has constructed one of the most spectacular sea-going tales to ever hit the screen. Russell Crowe stars as \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey, the undaunted Captain of the HMS Surprise, a British battle vessell which is dogged at every turn by the French warship Acheron. Vowing to bring his antagonists to justice, the vengeful chase is on in this wonderfully exciting, if not rare adventure film. Every aspect of this gem is on target from start to finish: acting, dialouge, cinematography, music, special effects, all first class. A stunning achievment.
0618526412|5.0|Oprah has done her public a great service by choosing this book. McCullers' first novel covers white savagery toward blacks in the Jim Crow South long before Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", but depicts in addition many other kinds of alienation and personal dysfunction, thereby contextualizing race mania and explicating it in a way few other works of the pre-desegregration era do. Some readers may find that McCullers has tried to do too much in a single book, but her directness will allow most to profit intellectually and morally from her story.
B000002U82|5.0|Who hasn't heard of Pink Floyd?  And then, who hasn't heard of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;?  Chances are, not many people.  &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a landmark in musical entertainment, arguably the most popular album ever released.  Although it was released over 30 years ago, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; hasn't aged a bit.  Now it is just as popular as it was in 1973 when it was first released - and it's clear why.  Pink Floyd makes music like no one else.<br />The album begins with Pink Floyd's frequent dialogue-filled, nostalgic-sounding opening - &quot;Speak to Me&quot; - and then moves in to a calm piece, &quot;Breathe in the Air&quot;.  It then seeps in to fast-paced, techno-sounding &quot;On the Run&quot; (don't you love those P.F. transistions?), followed by one of my favorite P.F. songs, a nearly poetic piece called &quot;Time&quot;.  Then there's one of Pink Floyd's best songs, &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.  Then the album goes in a slightly different-sounding direction with &quot;Money&quot;, which sounds like something you'd here playing at some late-night club in London.  Pink Floyd comes down a little for &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and then goes psychedelic on &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;.  The album closes with two of P.F.'s best, &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and my favorite song of the album, &quot;Eclipse&quot;.<br />Pink Floyd is timelessly outstanding, and it was first in &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; that the band's brilliance began to show.  &quot;Dark Side&quot; is an essential album for anyone and everyone, and if you've never heard it, you obviously have no idea what you're missing.
B00003CXCT|1.0|There's a lot of nonsense here about George Lucas's \\"right\\" to say which version we should buy, or \\"It's ok that the Special Editions are the only ones released because..\\".<br />None of us, I'm sure, could care less that G.Lucas tinkers with his films, as long as we have the option of seeing the originals too. The anger being directed at this release is justified insofar as it is not simply because it is the SE versions, but because we are told that this will be the ONLY version he will ever release again. Had the Originals been available I would have bought both (as a Star Wars fan from day 1) but in the absence of the originals, I won't touch the SE versions ever again (I have them on Laserdisc, once is enough).<br />The alleged 'deterioration' of the original film negatives as a defence for Lucas' claims is preposterous - 95% of the SE versions are restored from these same film elements, do you really believe that the remaining portion is the only part affected, or isn't worth saving? THX certified transfers to Laserdisc were done as recently as 1993-95, there is no fundamental problem with the original negatives. Changes were made to narrative & dialogue also, will he claim the original audio was lost too?<br />These are NOT the versions which won the awards. These are NOT the versions that I remember seeing as a child. These are NOT the versions I & millions of others spent a significant chunk of our childhoods recreating with toys that contributed to Mr. Lucas bank balance.<br />What George Lucas seems oblivious to, are the reasons people buy movies on home formats like DVD. Most of us have already seen a movie before we buy it on DVD - the DVD is bought so we can 're-experience' what we saw in the theatre. It's a living souvenir.<BR>I, & millions of others, saw these films from 1977-1983. I want the souvenir from that era, & so do they.<br />By all means George, digitally alter your films. Insert Homer Simpson as the Emperor, and replace every Stormtrooper with Ewoks for all I care - but end the arrogance and the endless profiteering from your (hitherto) loyal lifelong fans and GIVE US THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS TOO.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; is a classic, the band's most ambitious masterwork.  Later used as the soundtrack from the hit 1983 film, &quot;The Wall&quot; is a mix of songs that is among P.F.'s very best.  This time around, instead of going for psychedelic rock (as in &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;), P.F. goes more for odd, eerie, wacky pieces - and yet, these songs tell a story like no others.<br />The album's grand opening piece is &quot;In the Flesh?&quot;, which compares the album to a wall that the following songs alone can break.  The second song begins the story of a man's life, &quot;The Thin Ice&quot;, about the simplicity of young childhood.  Then we seep into the first part of one of Pink Floyd's most popular songs, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, which eventually became one of the most played radio hits of the 80's.  &quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot; moves us on to the man's childhood, where he was placed in a school full of abusive teachers - which then seeps into the best part of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; (Part 2).  &quot;Mother&quot; tells us about the young man's worries, which he speaks to his mother; &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot; is something of an obituary for childhood; &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; finds the man trying to conceal his horrible memories, but he can't; and therefor we find ourselves hearing about his &quot;Young Lust&quot;.  Then we learn about Pink's temper towards his wife in &quot;One of My Turns&quot;, which leads to his wife leaving in &quot;Don't Leave me Now&quot;.  &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; then finishes with &quot;Part 3&quot;; and the first disc closes with &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;.<br />The second disc is considerably different from the first; it focuses on life behind the Berlin Wall.  It opens with &quot;Hey You&quot;, then moves on to &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot; and &quot;Nobody Home&quot; (in which a man tries to hide from the authorities in charge of theWall).  &quot;Vera&quot; talks about Pink's seperation from his lover on the opposite side of the Wall; &quot;Bring the Boys Back Home&quot; is about Pink's desire to have his old friends back; and then comes &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, one of Pink Floyd's greatest pieces.  Pink has become numb to anything going outside the Wall (contrary to popular belief, the song is not a druggie song).  Then there's &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, and two live pieces - &quot;In the Flesh&quot; and a good version of &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;.  The ending of the second disc sounds as though it was inspired by Queen, not at all like P.F.'s traditional compositions.  Finally, the album closes softly with &quot;Outside the Wall&quot;.<br />&quot;The Wall&quot; can be taken in a few different directions; is it about drugs?  Is it about the Berlin Wall?  Or is about a troubled, drug-addict's horrid memories?  The lyrics are excellent, making some terrific songs; unfortunately, the songs just don't flow as on P.F.'s earlier albums.<br />All in all, you may like &quot;The Wall&quot;, or you may not.  In my opinion, &quot;The Wall&quot; is one of the greatest albums of all time and among Pink Floyd's best.  To sum it all up: &quot;The Wall&quot; is flawed brilliance.
0375432302|5.0|This book is definitaly on my \\"Top books\\" list. Probably as #2, only topped out by another of Dan Brown's novels. I have read this book multiple times, and still catch things that I havent previously noticed. I would not, however, suggest this book to anyone under the age of 15 (...), belong to Opus Dei, have a strong belief in christian faith, or someone eaily disturbed with the mention of Christian churches hiding many facts. If you do not fit in the above categories, and are still reading, very good! Buy this book! Yes, there are some exagerated parts, but it has to be this way. It's fiction.<br />I highly recommend this book, and if nothing else - it will hopefully open your narrow little mind to accept something different. (No offense intended)

B00005LMBK|5.0|This was a big show. So big that no one knew about it in Los Angeles. I said to some friends &quot;I am going to see Gorillaz tonight.&quot; They said: &quot;Are they playing tonight?&quot; These are people who like the band and have the CD and have been playing it all year. Very few of the Britpop bands come here to the West Coast so this was an occasion. So much of an occasion that many of the mods and the big sideburn crowd decided to go to Bang! or somewhere else where you can pay ten dollars to listen to records that came out in the 1960s or seven years ago. The reality of this whole night was that Gorillaz announced two shows about two months back. When tickets went on sales it sold out in one day. So the smart people gave up and just figured that listening to Paul Weller and The Smiths at home was just as cool. In fact they might look in a chat room where they can all talk about how much they are into Brian Molko? Drink a beer and chat away about that one time you actually touched Morrissey?<br />Actually I was still lurking in rainy San Francisco still getting over the thrill of Noise Pop and all the bands I saw, when I was thinking that I might actually go to Gorillaz. Since there was only one show in Bay Area and two in Hollywood, I decided to drive down south to have better chances of getting in. As luck would have it a ticket did appear out of nowhere and now we had to wade through the scalpers who were all practically giving away tickets. I have never seen so many guys selling tickets outside a venue. I guess that most people can't plan things two months in advance? Most of the gigs I go to are still at the last minute. Who knows? Gorillaz were going on in ten minutes. The Palladium is like Fort Knox. You can't bring anything in. It took about a half hour to get in.<br />By the time I bought two drinks (twenty dollars down the drain), and gotten my drinking wristband, I realized that I spent more on the drinks than the tickets. I think that water was four dollars. Do I sense another Woodstock 1999? Gorillaz were going on right then. They started with &quot;M1 A1.&quot; It was appropriate. They played behind a screen. Damon Albarn was leading the group most of the way through. It was hard to tell how many people were behind there. The Gorillaz cartoons played throughout. They were slightly in sync with the music. Unless you were up in the first front rows I doubt that you could even see much of the band behind the screen. It was the suspension of disbelief. We were supposed to believe that these Banana Splits characters up on the screen somehow had something to do with the music. Back in the early days of MTV some bands like ZZ Top didn't want to do videos. If you wanted to see them you had to buy a ticket to their shows. Gorillaz are the exact opposite. They are touring an MTV video with incidental music as a footnote. I wonder why Britney Spears didn't think of this first?<br />By the time they did &quot;5/4&quot;, one of the standout tracks, I could feel that the visuals now had something to do with the sounds. It was the Monkees all over again. Every three or so songs, they would have some cartoon play but it was hard to hear because people were talking. The audience itself was a mix of hiphop people and the TRL crowd. I was standing next to some 12-year girls who seemed to amuse themselves with in-jokes. I saw a Gorillaz CD at K-mart a few months ago. I guess that is where girls at the mall go to stay cutting edge? What happened to that lack of separation between life and art? Don't these girls know that Kurt Cobain was for real? That irony and being aloof was for clever fools who didn't want to stand for anything? Actually Gorillaz is not that new. Just the massive scale they operate on is.<br />John Lydon and Public Image did a similar behind the screen act in NYC twenty years ago. They had a white screen so you could see them. You could see their shadows. Then you could also see them on monitors. The audience's reaction was to riot and rip down the screen. The fans watching Gorillaz maybe had that impulse. Maybe they hoped that the wall would be coming down and they could applaud with all their hearts instead of with their minds. When Del Tha Funky Homosapien came out and did &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock The House&quot; he went out of his way to acknowledged the audience and engaged them slightly. Which didn't need a visual. He was saying to them: &quot;Hey, we are behind here, and we are not coming out, so just enjoy the show.&quot; Gorillaz didn't have it in their nature to show their face, but felt comfortable hiding behind a mask. Cobain they are not.<br />Gorillaz played most of the songs off the album except &quot;Latin Simone.&quot; Del Than Funky did mostly freestyle raps that were closer to the recent &quot;G-sides&quot; release. It was a multi-media experience and more like something you would see in a museum. Even in that case the artist would show up at the opening. Damon Albarn and company would like music to be like a video game. They are a spectacle. They are like a Kiss for people who have Hello Kitty lunchboxes. All the mall kids and Japanese tourists could get their 30 dollar t-shirts and 20 dollar posters and feel like they survived this hour long event. Afterwards I was bombarded by CDs, flyers, and stickers. Where is the Goriilaz afterparty? I'll send in a video of myself in audience having an experience.nce's reaction was to riot and rip down the screen. The fans watching Gorillaz maybe had that impulse.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I can not stress enough how great this CD is!  It's just a great, soulful, jazz CD.  There is always a fear that a CD won't meet up with the standards set by the first single from the CD but this one erased all my fears.  The CD is excellent...I listen to it when I really need to relax!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Much has been said about this career record. It was one of the most anticipated records of the year. The Strokes have come and went and there is little residue left in the memory department. Much like BRMC, they have produced a record that was very much like their first. But unlike BRMC, none of the songs are very memorable. The glum sounding \\"What Ever Happened?\\" and \\"Reptilia\\" sound like nothing has changed for them in two years. \\"12:51\\" sounds like they have been listening to the Cars a lot. Only if a band could take us on a time machine and land at Abbey Road Studios around the time The Beatles did Revolver. Only if they could soak up that vibe and bring it back home? Even the best moments on this record, like on \\"Meet Me In The Bathroom,\\" we feel ripped off. Maybe it's because since The White Stripes have already done four pretty good albums, we expect the same thing from The Strokes. But it's sad that the whole New York scene seems now to have been a three-year thing, unless some other band can hurry and breathe some life into it. The Strokes are cool. Maybe it's time to look elsewhere?
B00018D44U|3.0|After falling in love with Norah's first CD, I didn't think twice about buying her 2nd one.  However, I was every so slightly disappointed.  It didn't sound a lot like her first one necessarily.  Her first one was more jazz and that was what I was expecting.  This one is more folk-like.  But nonetheless, it is still a great CD and I highly recommend it.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|This is David Bowie's 26th studio album. That is a lot of music. A short while ago he released Heathen, which many thought was his best album in twenty years. He collaborated again with Tony Visconti, and Reality is sort of a part two of Heathen. The first two songs \\"New Killer Star\\" and \\"Pablo Picasso\\" could have been tracks from Heathen. Reality is Bowie's first real New York City album, similar to his many Berlin inspired records on the late 1970s. \\"Never Get Old\\" sounds like something off of Lodger. There is a mellow atmospheric trend on this album though. It is not really singles oriented. Each song seems open, bleeding, and hanging by a thread. It's sparser than the very full sounding, and the often-hard rocking songs, of Heathen. \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" by George Harrison is an interesting choice for cover song. Bowie is an interesting character. He may not always make the most exciting music, but it is a good thing that he continues to create.
B000089RVX|5.0|I finally bought this CD over spring break.  1st--I love Amy Lee's voice...she's not another Britney, she can really sing.  And 2nd--I can relate to a lot of their lyrics.  I think a lot of people could.  Overall this CD is wonderful.  There is just something about it, I just can't put it into words.  The only can I can say is buy it!
B000003S0R|5.0|This is album is so good that it intimidates me to speak of it. So how can I encourage you to investigate it? While lacking in standard rock and roll prepulsion (If you looking for that from Eno, look to his debut.), Tiger Mountain is rich in moods while focused in intent. There is a mystery in the grooves worth investigating! This is never at the expense of catchiness (if you find the multi-syllabic interesting.)No fear, though, there is emotion for all the intellectual grousing. For example, &quot;Put The Straw Under Baby&quot; feels like a surrealistic hymnal. Obviously this is not a moon june spoon baby baby baby sort of music. Eno capably blends a sense of his personal past to his (then)current musical interests.Now that I have stumbled through the garden of trite metaphors, I hope you'll give it a chance. Especially if you like mysterious lyrics delivered over superior music. Make no mistake, this is no flowerly trip through the prog fields. This is album with thorns as well as flowers. The Great Pretender is a eerie song that collapses into scary dissonance and Third Uncle was chosen by Bauhaus for cover material. Don't confuse this with some proto-goth trip! It is as broad as fiction and only Radiohead has ever come close. And they aren't as funny or as clever as Mr. Eno. Somewhere after psych rock but before punk rock, with a whiff of the theatric, exists a classic visionary record. Bands will continue to crack these codes long after Pet Sounds has been reduced to a children's rebus.
B00000DLUV|5.0|I have always been a Bee Gees fan, and this cd is one of the best cds I've heard.  I say even if you're not a Bee Gees fan, this one just might push you over the edge towards being one.  Go ahead, give it a buy. You WILL NOT be disappointed!
6305364648|5.0|Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be one of our most overlooked and underappreciated actresses.  She was brilliant in FREAKY FRIDAY, the penultimate heroine in HALLOWEEN, and a sick mommy in MOTHER'S BOYS.  In this bombastic James Cameron action thriller, Curtis plays the wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a man who has hidden the fact that he is spy from his wife in 17 years of marriage!  To her, he's just a boring computer salesman with a stuck up, disinterested daughter (Elisha Dushku in one of her first roles).  Jamie, looking for adventure in her life, teams up with a car salesman who pretends he's a secret agent (played with wonderful timing by the dependable Bill Paxton).  Meanwhile, Arnie and his partner (well played by Tom Arnold) think Jamie's having an affair with Paxton.  This all gets mixed up in the true plot of a demented terrorist (the appropriately evil Art Malik) out to blow up US cities.  Tia Carrere is along for the ride in the role of a beautiful but deadly curator.  Add Charlton Heston as Arnie's boss, and you have a talented cast.  Cameron knows how to do action films; the finale involving the airplanes and the bridge is terrific.  This movie is unabashedly entertaining, and even though it's a little too long (almost two and a half hours), Cameron keeps the action interesting.  Not bad for a California governor, Arnie!
B00005T30L|5.0|Terry Zwigoff's &quot;Ghost World&quot; is the anonymous Anytown USA, landscaped with strip malls, drive-up ATM windows, expresso bars, mini-marts, tanning parlors and a burger franchise on every corner. It's the place where the bus no longer runs, except in the mind of an old man on the bench. &quot;Ghost World&quot; is where everyone has big hair, drives an SUV, and wears designer clothers. It's tough to be a kid in &quot;Ghost World&quot; where your choices are limited to joining the &quot;in-crowd&quot; or, developing a highly refined sense of irony, as does our heroine, Enid. &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a brilliantly conceived film by Zwigoff, the director of the riveting documentary about the life and times of undergound comic artist, R.Crumb. Steve Bushemi plays Seymour, a charmingly eccentric collector of odd cultural artifacts who sometimes appears to be an alter-ego aforementioned Mr. Crumb. Thora Birch's Enid, is a directionless recent high school graduate (sort of) who has lost her bearings in a sea of suburban mediocrity. You will seldom see a more tender and complex relationship portrayed as the relationship between by Bushemi and Birch. They are two doomed outsiders who view the transparency of human relationships with intelligent irony. This is a small movie that should be a runaway success, but never will be. In &quot;Ghost World&quot;, we like big action packed blockbuster movies.  If you've ever questioned the society you live in, this one's for you. I absolutely loved this movie. It has great characters and writing, a distinctive and colorful visual style, and some vicious satire. Plus, the much-loved Steve Buscemi has his greatest role ever.  Every single scene has virtually no obligatory lines, and is both moving and hilariously funny. Thora Birch proves she can carry a movie and Steve Buscemi gives his career best; they're both oscar-worthy.
0790729725|5.0|not much i can say about this movie that fans of the movie dont already know!what i can say is this movie needs better dvd treatment and almost every one can agree with me on that,2disk special edition anyone?!
B000053VAF|5.0|I can certainly understand why some people wouldn't like this film. Taken at face value, it is a rude and crude comedy. Going one layer deeper, it is an unsubtle attack on organized religion. However, if you were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been raised as a Catholic, this movie is an absolute must-see. The film runs like a continual inside joke. It cranks out constant humor at the expense of the church, but at the same time validates the church's teachings. It is the mad-magazine version of the 6th-grade catechism; the national lampoon version of the stations of the cross. Yes, there is a lot of profanity and some of it comes across as gratuitous. But if you can put that aside, this movie provides a very moral tale not so different than the ones that Sister Barnabus used to tell in grade school - but a lot more fun.
B0001I55OC|3.0|First of all I don't know why people are saying this movie is terrible and the money shouldn't be spent to rent it? I think they're all forgetting that it is an action/sci-fi/drama flick and aren't keeping in mind that movies like that don't need character depth and such to make it decent. I personally thought it was worth spending the money to see in theatres. I had read the book and loved the whole concept and I thought the action was pretty good. The fire lit arrows being shot into the sky towards the castle was an awesome sight. True the movie could've been better, but not everyone can do a Michael Crichton novel justice like Spielberg did with Jurassic Park and JP 2: The Lost Word. At least the only thing Spielberg changed in Jurassic Park was keeping Hammond alive (in the book Hammond gets left on the island when he goes out looking for his grandchildren on his own and a pack of Velociraptors find him). If Spielberg had been behind the helm of Timeline it would've been even better, but as it is Timeline is a movie I don't mind owning on DVD one bit.
0783225792|5.0|Casino is nothing less than a Scorcese masterpiece, based primarily on the true story of the violent life and death of Tony &quot;The Ant&quot; Spilotro, who was the mob's chief enforcer during the early 70's, while protecting the mob's gambling interests run by Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. As someone interested in the development of the American mafia, Casino is a brilliant translation of the building of Bugsy Siegel's vision in the desert up to the gaudy haven for high rollers that it was during the 70s. This movie brings the dusty pages of Las Vegas history to life. Spilotro was the real thing; Joe Pesci gives us only a taste of how brutal he really was. His death in a mid-west cornfield was the final act of this particular chapter in Las Vegas history. This is perhaps Scorsese's most underrated film, Casino contains one of De Niro's finest performances--his Sam Rothstein is controlled, nuanced, quiet, contemplative, depressed, ambitious, and furious. De Niro plays all these sentiments at once, and he ultimately creates a character that may not be Scorsese's most likable but is certainly his most mesmerizingly believable. The film's rare dual voiceover is so well executed, as Pesci and De Niro's characters fight for control over the storytelling just as they battle for power over Vegas. This film is flamboyantly stylized-In many ways it is about style. There are as many flashy whip-turns and ironic soundtrack selections as there are peach blazers and white pantent leather loafers. If you want a film that is at once great entertainment and moving art, watch Casino, and let Scorsese transport you back to a rare moment in American history: &quot;The last time tough guys like us we're ever given anything that 'effing' valuable.&quot;
B00006RAKP|5.0|Wow, this album really hit the nail on the head. Each song gets better and better as the CD progresses. This is what gets me through each day in my life. Thanks Elton.. you are my inspiration.
B00013F35I|4.0|On the postive side -- the only place to get great live renditions of most of the songs from The Rising; excellent video work capturing an exurberant performance by both the band and the crowd; and a good collection of reliable standards.<br />On the negative side -- a surprising poor audio track for most of the vocals; don't they have decent mics in Spain??<br />Overall I'm very happy with this DVD and haven't come close to getting bored after 3 viewings.
0671027344|5.0|This book was a great read. \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\" is about a kid named Charlie. Charlie is a depressed boy newly into high school nd he meets these kids, Sam and Chris, and they become friends. Charlie, Sam, and Chris start hanging out regualry and they introduce Charlie to all kinds of stuff. They introduce to sex, drugs, rock and roll, and the Rocky Horror Picutre Show. It tells about what happens when he experiments with some of this stuff. Charlie also falls in love with Sam but dosen't do anything about except just sit there and wait for her to do something about it. <BR>This book was phenomnial. It was a good read. It would a great book for 16 and up.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|This is one of the two movies, among his 50+, that Ingmar Bergman himself is most proud of; in a recent interview, given before his retirement from the theatre (in January 2004,) he said that with \\"Persona\\" and \\"Cries and Whispers\\" he pulled off something he thought would be beyond his capability, and indeed - to this day both films (among his most complex,) and many of his others, keep impressing audiences.<br />This movie was shot on the island of Får&ouml; (Bergman's residence for the past 40 years,) by cinematographer Sven Nykvist, who had been Bergman's regularly used cinematographer for all his movies since \\"Jungfruk&auml;llan\\" a.k.a. \\"The Virgin Spring\\" (1960). \\"Persona\\" tells the story of actress Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann,) who has chosen muteness, and her nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson,) who observes her, keeps her company, and is trying to \\"cure\\" her while they live together in the archipelago during the summer. As always both these actresses do convincing jobs. This was Liv Ullmann's first appearance in a Bergman movie (it lead to a relationship between her and the director,) while Bibi Andersson had been reoccurring in Bergman's movies since \\"Smiles of a Summer Night\\" (1955).<br />MGM's presentation is less than professional. They have presented the movie in Aspect Ratio 1.33:1 instead of Original Aspect Ratio 1.37:1! MGM have announced that they are not going to correct this mistake. This also goes for their DVD editions of the OAR 1.37:1 movies \\"Hour of the Wolf\\" and \\"Shame,\\" which originally were released by MGM (although corrected) in 1.66:1!<br />The picture quality on this DVD is furthermore brownish and gray, while the intention was clear black and clear white.<br />This movie is available on a region-free DVD by Tartan, which has less features, but clearer picture, and is presented in Original Aspect Ratio 1.37:1.<br />MGM's edition features a 27 minute long documentary, short interviews with Andersson and Ullmann, and (not very good) audio commentary by Marc Gervais, but the extras do not make up for the cropped picture in my opinion. Also, this disc may not work on certain DVD-players; one of my two players cannot open the menu for this DVD, although the player hasn't had such problems with any of my other 100+ DVD's. Zero stars for MGM, full stars for Bergman's landmark.do not make up for the cropped picture in my opinion.

B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is SO awesome!  Kanye West has some amazing beats and even better lyrics.  Usually I try to ignore the lyrics of rap songs that I &quot;like&quot; but with Kanye I want to hear every single word!  He can be really serious sometimes, but other times he'll be sarcastic and really funny.  He talks about God, about being poor and black, about materialism, about black people hating themselves.  He also talks about being proud of his accomplishments but also says how he knows he's not perfect either, which I think is very genuine.  He just has some great lyrics.  I really think people should support this CD because it's not all about &quot;pimps and ho's&quot; and crap like that--it has great beats AND great ideas.  It's just really good.  This is what rap should be!
051788710X|4.0|Conscious Dreaming is the road map to the expansive world that exists in every dreamers mind. Robert Moss is a gifted lucid dreamer who shares his intriguing yet simple techniques for readers to use in their own dreams. Much of the book accounts the past experiences that Robert Moss had while in his many states of lucidity. These are used to show the wonderful imagination that not only he possesses but that all of us already possess. In every persons mind there is a world so magical and beautiful that is just awaiting its discovery. I personally have used some of the techniques before I even read the book. In the past, I had had a dream where I was walking in the empty halls of a hockey stadium. As I was walking, I suddenly realized that I was dreaming. I tried my best to stay calm in fear of awakening from the dream. I thought of the endless possibilities that were now before me as I placed my hand on a wall. I said aloud, &quot; I want this stadium to change into an ice palace.&quot; I dont know why I thought of that but its what came out. With the last syllable barely off my tongue the stadium was transformed into one of the most beautiful places I had ever witnessed. If dreamers are wanting to expand their abilities then this is a great book to start....
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is really fun. The way that Tarantino uses obscure music to set the mood for his movies is out of control. I just saw Vol. 2 and I was a little dissapointed, but Vol. 1 is really cool. If you are a Tarantino fan (Pulp Fiction, Resivoir Dogs, True Romance) you will like this movie. Otherwise you may think that there is too much swearing and violence.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The opening shot of this film during the titles pretty much sets the direction of this 'little film'; the camera lens aimed squarely on Scarlet Johansson's backside.  Sofia Coppola is positively in love with this actresses' body, as becomes rather apparent in the course of the film.<br />In between times, we have Johansson's character, a philsophy major graduated from Yale who nevers cracks a book in the film, embroiled in an inexplicably improbable marriage with an impossibly shallow character.  Bill Murray, playing himself (something he's become really good at doing with advancing age and experience), is in a similarly mismatched marriage.  These two Americans in temporary residence at a posh hotel in Japan wind up having a bit of a fling, albeit Platonic, but with a cryptically intimate ending.<br />Is there a story in this?  Hard to say. It's mostly episodic with glimpses at Japanese society on several different levels: religious ceremony, the hotel/bar/lounge scene (with evidence of America's intrusion), the youth party scene and other nighttime activities (including a great moment with Karaoke, with again evidence of U.S. intrusion), the advertising world, talk show moments, and overall manners.<br />But the camera is all too often on Johansson's body as if this were the sole motivation for the film.  Notwithstanding Sofia's chief interest in this film, it's worth seeing at least once, for Murray's straight man to Japan's parade of clowns.  Great fun!  This alone saves the film from itself.
0385336942|5.0|An absolutely masterful blending of history, fiction, and the fantastic. An amazing debut, with characters that are fully fleshed out, and narrative that transports the reader into a wonderful adventure with little/no need for suspension of disbelief. At times, Callanan's prose reminded me of Mark Helprin's &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; or &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot;. Beautiful stuff.
B0000029GA|5.0|Downthread someone said that &quot;someone had the temerity to compare the Illmatic Nas to Eminem.&quot; I don't see how that comparison is so egregious, being that Em is currently the best in the industry and that he is just as, if not more brilliant than Nas. Both are lyrical geniuses. Illmatic is......just brilliant. Every track, EVERY track is hot. And Primo drops the tightest beat in the history of underground hip-hop with &quot;Represent&quot;(which Nas kills and is my personal favorite track on the album). If you call yourself a fan of rap, it is MANDATORY that you cop this.
B00008A7QK|4.0|First of all, the title of the album, the cover of the album, and song titles totally contradict what is contained on this album. With songs names like &quot;Monolith&quot; and &quot;Planet Queen&quot; and &quot;Bang A Gong (Get It On)&quot; coupled with the cover of a guitar player in front of a giant stack of amplifiers, you'd think this would be a sonic assault on your ears. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact this is a VERY mellow album. Myself only being familiar with a few of T-Rex's more upbeat hits and in my 30's, I decided to pick it up. I was very surprised and somehwat disappointed in what I found. I wanted more of a straight up rocking record, but no dice. It's definitely a good record, very cohesive, nice flow, inspired the glam rock movement, but nowhere near what I was expecting. Unless you are a big fan of 70's prog rock or are looking for something to just lay around and chill out to, avoid this record.
B000084T18|1.0|this guy sucks. he has absolutely no talent. anyone reading this review should go listen to some real music......
B000002MM8|5.0|After many spins in my CD player, this CD has become one of my favorite DCD albums. Of course, when I first got the CD, I would never have said that. It just seemed really strange to me then. Luck for me, this CD was not my introduction to DCD, which was The Serpent's Egg (their finest, in my opinion, due to the marvelous song &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot;). So, while I recommend this album to all true music lovers, you should be aware that it was a turning point in DCD's musical career, and it is very different from their earlier more European, Classical works, which I heartily recommend you sample first. The best songs on the album for me are: &quot;Ariadne,&quot; &quot;Yulunga,&quot; and &quot;Towards the Within.&quot; A lot of people I know also like &quot;The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove&quot; and &quot;The Carnival is Over.&quot; Finally, I would like to point out that this is DCD's best selling album but not necessarily their absolute best overall, although I really love it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album was a massive European hit, and it follows the tendences of the European modern pop music, but also creates new ways and perspectives for it.<BR>On this album, Madge played with some of the biggest elements of previous pop music (the rap sequence in American Life, a catchy, ironic song was inspired by Madonna´s idol Debbie Harry on Blondie´s &quot;Rapture&quot;; the &quot; I got you under my skyn&quot; verse of Love Profusion remembers the Sinatra classic tune; she refers to an Eurhythmics song on &quot; I´m So Stupid&quot; and to her own Like a Prayer gospel chorus on Nothing Fails. Anyway the music is fresh, innovative, poetic.<br />The biggest dance hits here are Die Another Day, Nobody Knows Me and Hollywood. The best ballads are Love Profusion, Nothing Fails and Intervention. The most beautiful, emotional track is Easy Ride and American Life is a cool, mixed-up electro - hip-hop song. <BR>This album contains 4 #1 dance hits on Billboard and a #4 hit; 2 top40 Hot 100 hits and a best-selling single for 2002-3 (DAD). In Europe and Canada it has 5 top 5 singles and a top 5 remixes EP in all important European markets and is among the best-selling albums of 2003 worldwide.

B00008S2VG|1.0|Im a huge Madonna fan. However,I have to say folks,<br />the album is very disappointing.It makes some interesting<br />points, but in terms of entertainment value it falls flat.<br />Perhaps this is why it stalled at 700,00 copies sold.It may<br />have reached million plus, but took a year to do so.Madonna's<br />best: True Blue,Like A prayer,Im Breathless,Erotica,Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light.Madonna's worst:Madonna(debut),Like a virgin,Evita Soundtrack,Music and American Life.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is a great movie for all people!  It's heartwarming, it's smart, and it's wickedly funny!  You won't be able to resist laughing at Hugh Grant dancing around the prime minister's house singing \\"Jump\\" by the Pointer Sisters.  And then there's the aging rock star whose career is just about over, so he squeezes the life out of his one big hit... believe me you'll get a kick out of this one!  And after the movie is over you will probably sigh and say... \\"Ah... the world isn't such a bad place afterall!\\"  Good for the dreamer and believer in all of us!
B0000630BT|4.0|1990 was a time of change for Judas Priest, The simple drum techniques of Dave Holland were long gone, replaced by the much missed double Kick stylings of Scott Travis who showed reflections of Les Binks (Stained Class/Hell Bent For Leather).<br />On Their last outing with the &quot;METAL GOD&quot; Rob Halford (Until Now!!!!!!) They decided to go back to their Stained Class roots leaving fans to rejoice.  The band totally ripped on this album, they had lots of anger to get out of them do to the uncalled accusations brought upon them.  Every song on this album is statement to to the cluesless that they were back, and pissed off!<br />The reason why I gave this album 4 and 1/2 star was do to &quot;One Shot Of Glory&quot;, which was a weaker part of the album.
B000002G0P|5.0|I have a real problem with artists using their public exposure to espouse skewed or &quot;limited&quot; political viewpoints, however this album is timelessly flawless in musical content and delivery.  I love Cherone's voice and Nuno's complicated riff structures and time signatures (he is PHENOMINAL).  These guys have so much talent, I wish they would reunite and continue the musical bliss...even if it includes political slamming.
0790730960|4.0|On seeing the second installment in the Batman trilogy, I immediately though it wasn't going to be that good.  I think it is one of the best film sequels of all time.  The main character didn't change, the characters were richer and more evil, and the acting got even better.  Tim Burton really hyped up the gothic in this film.  This film was more serious and hair raising.  It lacked the exitement the first had, but it is still better than the third and fourth installments.  I applaud Michelle P.  for her portrayal of Selina Kyle (AKA Catwoman.) she couldn't have been better.  Two thumbs up. See this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a Sci-Fi fan for 2+ generations and have rarely seen a program of this caliber.  In innovation, it is like the first Star Trek series.  In quality, it is without peer.  Bring it back.  Please.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I had very high expectations on seeing this movie.  The film did not let me down for one minute.  The special effects were wonderful and the art direction the film had was unlike any other I had ever seen in a comic book film.  It wasn't dark and gothic like the four Batman films.  The characters were really deep and it was almost like you knew them.  The setting was bold, colorful, cheery, and vibrant.  It was a really awesome film.  I reccomend this for anyone who loves comic book films, and if they are fans of the stars than this is a definate must.<BR>One of the best films of the 2000s.
0140072187|5.0|I never knew this book existed, but being an ex Army chopper pilot with the 1st Cav in Vietnam, I found this to be the most realistic book ever written on this subject.  I identified with every single word.  Not like the junk you see in the movies.<BR>Probably in the top 5 books on any subject that I've ever read
B00005NRO3|3.0|Maybe a good sequel, but Scream 2 was very mediocre.  I mean, it has good thrills but it didn't raise the bar any higher, which is expected in a sequel.  I have a few good things to say.  The suprise ending was really chilling.  The characters seemed to deepen more than in the original.  Overall the death scenes were pretty fresh and new, but they weren't as nail biting as the first.  It was predictable, and mediocre.  See it if you are a fan of the trilogy, and definately do not see it if you hate sequels.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine recently did a poll of hundreds of music luminaries,and the immortal rubber soul came in as the 5th greatest album ever.VH1 did a similar poll, with rubber soul coming in 6th.In addition,Michelle won a grammy for being the song of the year in 1966, and In my life was voted song of the century in 2000.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Easily Slayer's best release to date.  This album is as in the reveiw title an absolute poerhouse.  Reign in Blood rips into with no mercy with the opening track &quot;Angel of Death&quot; which is a ripping track and extremely dynamic.  From then on you are in for one heavy ride.  This is Slayers best work and a must for any Slayer fan.

6305754969|5.0|Paired with Robert Mitchum, El Dorado is essentially a remake of Howard Hawks' earlier Rio Bravo (with writer Leigh Brackett updating her own script). John Wayne, instead of sheriff, plays an aging gunman, who is getting too wise for the game. Robert Mitchum, as the drunken sheriff, takes over the role of the drunken Dean Martin, and James Caan is the fresh faced greenhorn last played by Ricky Nelson (thankfully, Caan doesn't sing). Hawks and Brackett take their time in setting up this story, giving Wayne and Mitchum plenty of backstory, before the stand-off in the town of El Dorado.<br />In this movie, Thornton is offered a job by land grabber Ed Asner to take out the Sheriff of El Dorado and run the rightful landowners off their land.  Thornton refuses and instead goes to El dorado to help his friend against the other gunmen Asner hired led by Nelse McCloud played by regualr Wayne Co-Star Christopher George.<br />Caan plays Mississippi a young man who cannot use a gun and is given a sawed off shotgun as his weapon.  Arthur Hunnicut plays Bull and essentially takes over the role that Walter Brennan played in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;.<br />The movie has a great deal of action as well as humor as Wayne and Caan and Hunnicutt attempt to sober up the sheriff.  Wayne and Mitchum had great chemistry together and even though the Duke was aging, still commands the screen in this movie.<br />Lots of fun.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|haven't heard the full soundtrack yet, but i'm just curious to see if that &quot;song&quot; is on there that plays whenever the bride is ready to kick some ass?  whenever the camera does a closeup on her eyes its this weird high pitched sound that i love.  if anyone can let me know if it's on there and what the name of the &quot;song&quot; is, that would be great!<br />thnx!
B00005JLYW|1.0|Jesus. <br />H. <br />Christ.<br />Am I Christian? No. No, I am not. But you know what? This movie is unquestionable evidence that God exists. God *has* to exist, because Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is so utterly soul-crushingly BAD that it can't be anything but the main torture instrument of Satan himself. Seriously. Hell couldn't possibly be anything else but a gigantic movie theater, packed to the brim with the damned, strapped into their chairs, mouths gagged to halt the screams, their eyes wired permanently open as Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle plays on infinite loop FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY, ERADICATING ANY LAST VESTIGE OF HUMANITY THAT MAY STILL DESPERATELY CLING TO LIFE WITHIN THE BROKEN AND DESICCATED HUSK OF WHAT WAS ONCE THEIR ETERNAL SOULS.<br />...but I digress, ha ha! Here's a few things you'll find in this movie! Awful acting! Horrible special effects! Boring action! Missing plot! Literally stupid charcters! Painful jokes! Nauseating editing! And perhaps the biggest offense of all, THE BOOTY-FACTOR DID NOT HELP AT ALL. LUCY LIU. NAKED. NAKED LUCY LIU. IN A NORMAL WORLD, THAT ONE THING SHOULD TECHNICALLY MAKE UP FOR ALL OTHER SHORTCOMINGS. But it did not. Not a bit. Don't get me wrong, I love booty. What I don't love is being able to feel each individual brain cell in my head screaming out in anguish before committing mass suicide under the raw unfiltered negative force that is absorbed during the viewing of this movie. I actually felt physical pain seep into my flesh, a sensation that only grew stronger with each passing minute the movie played. In all seriousness, this is the worst movie ever. EVAR. <br />I simply request you heed my advice and stay away. Even if you liked the first movie. ESPECIALLY if you liked the first movie. Trust me.
B000002WYT|5.0|I don't have every DMB album I should. Crash is, in fact, my first. Don't get me wrong! I love The Dave Matthews Band, but I just could never get around to buying one of their albums. <BR>That said, I decided to get this one because of three songs I'd heard from it: Two Step, Crash Into Me, and Too Much, which are the three best, in my opinion.<BR>The Dave Matthews Band are probably the only band like themselves in today's world of glitz, glamour, and synthetic pop. Perhaps it's because they're true originals, or perhaps they're the best of an underground movement we haven't heard of yet, but whatever the case, I consider this their masterpiece.<BR>I won't give a song-by-song rundown like so many others do in their reviews, but suffice it to say that every song is wonderfully written, has flawless musicianship, and Dave Matthews is just the right guy to lead this band. It wouldn't fit with anyone else.<BR>I will highlight the songs I mentioned earlier. <BR>Two Step: An energetic, subtly powerful song, and hands down, the loudest that DMB has ever been. <br />Crash Into Me: It's such a romantic song, even though I think it's about a kid's wet dream. It's so tender and real. It reminds me of the first girl I loved.<br />Too Much: The big hit single with those famous lyrics: &quot;I Eat Too Much, I Drink Too Much, I Want Too Much, Too Much!&quot; It has a cool, big band feel to it, especially during the chorus.<br />If you never buy another Dave Matthews Band album, buy this one. It's their Sgt. Pepper's - they can only go down from here!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is wonderful. I really mean it. I have a wide range of music likes and dislikes. I am really picky. I thought I would hate Evanescence, because people call them Goth and Rock and I am a country singer, and also enjoy Adult Contemporary music and other such stuff. I heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and was impressed. I listened to My Immortal and fell in love. I played Going Under and there was no going back. I am now a big fan of Evanescence. If you have not heard their music, do so now. And don't make your decision based soley on the music clips this site plays, their music is so much better than that. I hope you are happy in whatever decision you make. If you get the CD, I hope you enjoy it! Hi from the Nation's Capital!
B000001GPX|5.0|I originally purchased the two symphonies on this disc when they were sold seperately.  After buying the seperates (at a much higher price each than what this is selling for) DG decided to combine the two.  I love them so much that I bought this edition as well.  For the price, there's little reason not to buy this disc.<br />With all the glowing reviews of this CD I believe it would be kind of silly to try to say any more good things about it.  So let me just offer this caveat:  Yes, this is a rousing, bold, forceful, intense performance of Beethoven.  This disc never fails to impress, and the dynamics of the performance serve as a wonderful demonstration of the fidelity of your stereo.  It's a hard-hitting, attention grabbing performance.  That's the good news and the bad news.<br />The bad news being that these performances are not exactly subtle.  So, if you're seeking subtlety you may be a little overwhelmed.  Of all of Beethoven's works, it is the symphonies that have the most clear quality of spectacle and theatre.  Piano sonatas and string quartets lend themselves to a more limited and refined audience.  Kleiber really plays up the drama, the spectacle, and the theatre in these performances.  This may lead some listeners to feel it's all a bit overdone.  I recently played this disc in the office and a college-aged employee who likes heavy metal said, &quot;Wow, that kicks ass!&quot;  Some would see that as a ringing endorsement, some as a warning.<br />That being so stated there are few reasons not to own this disk.  It's a landmark performance at a bargain price.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|When I saw the preview to this movie,I have to admit I was a little skeptical.I thought to myself,\\"Are they just making one last crappy movie so they can cash their last check?\\"But,when the Oscar nods came out,I saw that Diane was nominated for Best Actress for this movie.I knew that I had to see it,because I know Diane never disappoints when she gets an Oscar nomination.So,I went with my sister to see it,and I loved almost every minute of it.Diane&Jack make an amazing team,and Diane definitely deserved her nomination,because Diane is hilarious,and Jack is as well.Diane is a successful playwright who is usually not very open and always has the attitude of a businesswoman,and Jack is an old playboy in his 50's who does not date anyone under 30-at least until he meets Diane's character.And,I have to admit,the supporting cast has some moments,too(Diane's sister in the movie is amusing in the few scenes she's in,Keanu Reeves is suprisingly good as the suave,young man fighting for Diane's affection.)<br />But,the whole \\"opposites attract\\" thing is a little used up,and some of the scenes don't go anywhere for a very long time.<br />Instead of those little flaws and 2 or 3 more,this movie is definitely watchable.Not the best movie by either of two huge stars,but still a good one.
B00004TH83|5.0|Much, much better than such unknown starlet.  Way to go, Lara!  This is a great album.
B000089RVR|2.0|Give it up, Dido...<br />It's been done before, and much better...<br />Her name is Sarah McLachlan -by the way, don't try so hard to copy her mesmerizingm haunting voice cause it just DOESNT WORK!!!
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Excited to get this, you bet I was. Even though I had anticipated great things from Michael, this is far better than I could have ever imagined !!!!!!!!<BR>The shutter style (various performances superimposed on/with each other) were seamless and the filmographers have done a remarkable job. You'll see Michael in vivid color, and then flash backed into Sinatraesque black and white. It's a visually stimulating treat, add his amazing band and his beautiful voice and VOILA - a fantastic music video.<br />My only mild criticism is that on the cd portion there are not 100 new songs - I want more!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>Michael's personality shines throughout and it's invigorating to see and hear someone so pure, so youthful, so energetic and ever so respectful of the music he obviously loves. <BR>Standing Ovation Worthy.
B000069AUI|2.0|I loved &quot;Parachutes&quot; for the very same reasons I don't love this album: reminiscing of love lost, or about to be.<BR>It was delicate, soothing, appeasable yet appealing; on the other hand, &quot;A Rush...&quot; is simply boring.<br />ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
B000088E6D|5.0|For almost a year I've enjoyed listening to Michael. I can't seem to get enough and look forward to seeing him at a venue near me soon. There's no one I could listen to more often, and no one who has left such an impression on my musical soul.<BR>Michael Bubl makes beautiful music.........
B00008S2VG|5.0|Almost everybody in the world heard the single and title track of the 'American Life' album, and for the first time in years, people had an opinion about a Madonna record. It might be a difficult single to get used to, but it serves as a good introduction to the album. Too bad the non-controversy surrounding the video marred the album’s release.<br />On 'Ray of Light' post-motherhood she was spiritual. On 'Music' she was in the throws of Guy Ritchie induced love and a newfound friend in Mirwais. On 'American Life', Madonna talks and really opens up.<br />'American Life' succeeds as an album where 'Music' failed. It sounds like an album, with an agenda of what the singer wants to say. On 'Music' the mix of Mirwais, William Orbit and Mark 'Spike' Stent all producing made it sound unresolved as a whole and a bit messy. And it had 'American Pie' on it. Here the sound is consistent and as a result it's brave and strong where 'Music' was afraid to really go for it. <br />Initially it's not an easy listen. There is a lot going on here, but it sounds fantastic and definitely an album that you want to listen to again and again. <br />With her vocals right up in the mix, this is as close as we've ever got to Madonna. More so, than the last album and also on 'Ray of Light'. <br />It's braver too - no longer does she hedge her bets and mix an album with people which she scored earlier successes with like Pat Leonard on 'Ray of Light' ('Frozen'), and William Orbit on 'Music' ('Runaway Lover', 'Amazing'). On 'American Life' it's her vision and Mirwais's production alone - and it's all the better for it. <br />However, like 'Erotica' this album could be overlooked if people judge the album by the first single. And like with 'Erotica', that would be a real shame. <br />Here is my song by song break down:<br />American Life - <BR>First single and it's the mission statement of the album. Whether you love it or hate it, as the beginning of the album it makes sense and serves as a good introduction as to what the rest of the albums' lyrics are about. It's also, in my opinion, the weakest song. <br />Hollywood - <BR>This is the second single. After the first track it's actually a huge relief - instantly catchy and fast-paced it reminds you of what Madonna is about when she's good. Great tunes, attitude. It starts with bird singing noises in the background, and soon Madonna gets into the Hollywood is not-a-very-nice-place theme of the song. <br />I’m So Stupid - <BR>A bit slower with her voice distorted at the start. It's sounds a little 60s with the synths in the background, and has more of a rock feel to it. With lyrics like 'Everybody's looking for something', it's a grower. The lyrics are a little basic for a Madonna song, but the vocals and stop-beat guitar riff is truly infectious.<br />Love Profusion - <BR>Single No.4, probably the most straightforward dance track on the album. I think this is one of those that could become a favorite and it feels like a classic upbeat Madonna song. It fuses the message behind the song 'American Life' with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well. <br />Nobody Knows Me - <BR>This song is insane. Very electronic, chaotic, fast, manic. Pounding synths. There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace. Includes one of the best Madonna lyrics ever: “No one’s telling you how to live your life, but it’s a set up until you’re fed up.”<br />Nothing Fails - <BR>A grand choice for single no.3, this is classic downbeat Madonna. It's also the first time the album drops the pace. Think 'Don't Tell Me' mixed with the low, gravelly voice on 'Live to Tell'. The London gospel choir sounds amazing when their voices take off. Strong, with beautiful strings. It really is a shame that the Nevin’s mix was used as a radio single, because more people should have had the chance to hear this far superior version.<br />Intervention - <BR>Mid-paced, it builds up to be a lovely album track. Not a single, but with its REM 80s-style guitars in the background it's a good track to follow 'Nothing Fails'. <br />X-Static Process - <BR>Rumors that this would be the big 'Impressive Instant' dance track, like that from “Music”, were wrong. It's one of the slowest tracks. It's also striking because throughout the album Madonna’s vocals feel very close and real - here she sounds bare. Intimate. <br />Mother and Father - <BR>This isn't the sad confessional track the title leads you to believe. It's stronger than previous attempts on a similar theme - 'Inside of Me', 'Promise to Try' and 'Oh Father'. The Daft Punk-esque beats and yet another rap by M herself, relegate this novelty song to album track status, as I’m sure even Madonna herself is a little embarrassed by it, now that it’s out of her hands!<br />Die Another Day - <BR>Like the 'American Life' single, this song had mixed reactions when released. But bizarrely, because the production sounds consistent throughout the whole album, it fits. Die Another Day finds itself a home here and compliments the set. The electro/organic combo is elegant, Madonna vocals are bang on and this easily ranks as the best Bond theme ever!<br />Easy Ride - <BR>Like 'Gone' at the end of “Music”, again this feels like an epitaph for the album. It sounds like she's exhausted - and no wonder - in a good way, again the strings sound amazing. A great and natural end to the album. Also rumored to be the 5th and final single, with remixes for it and Mother and Father, supposed to hit the shelves somewhere along her “re-Invention Tour”.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Master and Commander is an engaging and dramatic experience that shouldn't be missed. Russel Crowe (Gladiator) is wonderful as the captain of a ship that's trying to track down a dangerous French warship. The warship attacks his ship in an excellent battle in the beginning of the film. After that Crowe is determined to stop it. Pail Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, A Knights Tale) is also fantastic as the ships doctor and Crowe's bestfriend. The ship battles are excellent and entertaining but there's not really a lot of that. There's a lot more dialogue and scenes where we get to know the crew of the ship. Bettany surprisingly makes a lot of this movie his own. He has great scenes with Crowe and also touching scenes with a boy on ship who he takes under his wing and teaches about animals and nature. Some people will think there's not enough action but it's still an excellent film. When there is action it's very good, the scenery is very nice, directing great and Bettany gives what should've been an oscar nominated performance.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This CD has great rhythm. It's one main flaw is that the lyrics are horrible. Though they may flow well and make a good tune, lyrics are what truely make the song. <br />Best songs on the album: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10.
B000005ITX|5.0|Had to hear this after all the glowing reviews.  I was a little nonplussed at first by the trumpet parts; it sounded vaguely like the Tijuana Brass.  For a so-called psychedelic record there's not much messing around with the recording and the only bit that sounds psychedelic is a fine guitar break on &quot;House is not a Motel&quot;.  <br />On this record at least Arthur Lee was often a very strange, effete vocalist singing perhaps even stranger lyrics, usually without any rhythmic variation, like he'd been listening to baroque music or something.  And on this set he takes the prize for most alienated songwriter I've heard on record, which may explain the critical cult.  The music's rhythms resemble a lot of stuff the Moody Blues did later, perhaps under this record's influence, though I don't know that to be the case.  Seems like maybe Bowie and U2 could have cribbed some ideas as well.  The melodies are consistently counterintuitive so it takes a couple listens to digest.  Greatest pop record of the 60's or the mid-60's or even 1967?  Not for me because there's not much rock'n'roll.  I think the Beatles, the Kinks, the Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield were all doing stuff that has aged better.  But this is still worth the pittance you pay for it.
B00009L1TA|5.0|This has got to be the best Travolta film out there today, the cast is plentyful and the dark tense action thriller is worth the watch. Sam is great too, the storyline is strong and as the movie says, 'Basic'. 10/10
B000002MTU|5.0|From the Cradle represents some of Clapton's best work. Now he has a lot of great work (for me, mostly blues) over a very long period of time. Some people want to hear just the originals, and that's OK, but to hint at a complaint of covering the blues is to not understand the blues. I am a blues fan and a player of the blues. I love the blues. Yes, I have the originals too, and I can get into them for review. However, the blues (and I think most music) is to be interpreted, not copied. And here, as well in later works, Eric is interpreting the blues. As a player, I don't necessarily play with a bunch of guys to copy a song. We kind of change it around to fit our own styles and sound. I definitely think it is better to listen to, and a whole lot more fun to play. If we didn't have interpretation of music by your local bands, we wouldn't have many local bands, and to me quite honestly it is difficult to pay much attention to your average local band if there are too many originals, unless of course their originals are really exceptional. Which brings us right back to this album. This is a great interpretation, and Eric went on to keep releasing blues albums that keep sounding great. I find his interpretations inspiring, and make me want to pick up a guitar or bass and jam along with Eric, having a really good time. And that's what music is all about. Right?
0553269631|5.0|This book was originally published in 1940 and has been considered a classic ever since. Unfortunately, as Mark Twain once said, \\"A classic is a book everybody praises but nobody reads.\\" In this case, I am glad to see Oprah recommend it and thus restore its popularity. The characters are rough and sometimes ugly, but beneath all this the heroine manages to find beauty and happiness.<br />Great story for young women readers.
078681859X|3.0|I liked Bartimaeus, but didn't like the relationship between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel. . .Nathaniel is so stupid I really didn't care what happened to him and actually stopped reading the book because of him. . .but then I wanted to see what happened to Bartimaeus so started reading again.(took me a long time to go back to the book though!)  I think the author (Jonathan Stroud) should have made his little magician a little smarter.  After all, he was smart enough to bring forth Bartimaeus wasn't he? Most of the time I just wanted to slap him!(Nathaniel)  Don't know if I'll buy any more of the trilogy or not. . .
0618526412|5.0|A book that has been around since 1940 zooms to bestseller status in a heartbeat when recommended by Oprah. Usually I am skeptical about Oprah's picks, but in this case I have to agree with her. It is about time this book receive recognition for its portrayal of triumph against all odds.<br />I would especially recommend this book for young women readers, although as a male, I also enjoyed it.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Amazing movie, you would never guess its THAT good when you first go in to see it! The start of the film was just not expected! That 360-degree slow motion turn was just SUPERB! Very, very cool, the best I've ever seen in a 360 shot! The sound was just great. Then there was that bus!:--- 'AIRBOURNE!', yeah I'm talking about the bus! This movie is priceless! The cast was all-great, but I don't think Don Cheadle did too well in this film. <BR>The story was great, pushed to a great extent and it turned out believable! Truly a classic, SWORDFISH! Great Action! Great Plot! Great Cast! Stands out above many action flicks!<br />10/10! (In this case 5/5!)
B00012FXB8|3.0|This would have been a good stand-alone movie, but isn't a worthy sequel to the excellent &quot;Aliens&quot;.  There are too many plot twists and suppositions that aren't believable from the ending of &quot;Aliens&quot;.  For example, how could Ripley have been impregnated inside the ship when the queen Alien was never inside the ship?  <BR>Getting back to the suspense and thrill similar to the first film is one of the redeeming qualities to this film.  There are several instances of genuine fear in the film.  The cinematography is very good, and adds to the &quot;spookiness&quot; of the film.  The alien looks a bit different than in the first two films, also.  <BR>I don't think this is a worthy sequel to the two top-notch films that preceded it.
B000002KB8|5.0|Although this may not be the album that started it all, it certainly influenced a lot of heavy metal to come. just one look at the cover and ya know it's gonna be good. That's gotta be one of my all-time favorite album covers. The album kicks off with the sludgy, doomy title track which ends in faster doom. Then comes the harmonica-driven Wizard, but it is still as heavy as anything out there, don't be fooled by the harmonica. Then the trio Behind the Wall Of Sleep, Bassically, and NIB are probably the best songs on the album. All of them are equally heavy, sludgy and dingy. Wicked World, the next track would set the basis for what many Black Sabbath songs would be about for a long time. This song is about politics, and the stuffy suited politicians who are mean and cruel. The 15 minute-plus track Warning/Sleeping Village is a wonderful showcase for Tony Iommi's fantastic lead guitar, and Ozzy crawling vocals. I personally think this is one of the best heavy metal albums of the 70's, and I think anyone who calls themself a metalhead should NOT be without this album.
0440237688|4.0|I read this book a few years ago, and have just recently read Fahrenheit 451, a very similar book. Both are about colorless, utopian societies, and in both the hero chooses to go against this society. Thinking is no longer present in either of these simplified worlds - who needs choice, and the problems that go with it? I enjoyed both books thoroughly, and would recommend this book to people of all ages.<br />I would also like to note that the sales rank of this book is 451.
B0000634EW|5.0|I just can't believe how heavy and sludgy this is. It's like Pantera and early Black Sabbath meet and go to New Orleans. That's how it sounds. It's sludgy, dirgy, creeping crawling filth-covered southern sounding heavy metal. Lysergik Funeral Procession is one of my all time favorite songs. It's got a ballad (Learn From This Mistake), but the rest is sludgy molten 500-decibel hard rock. It can get QOTSA-ish sometimes, like on Stained Glass Cross, and that's good because QOTSA are a very good band. It was formed by Pantera members Phil Anselmo and Rex Brown and COC guitarist Pepper Keenan. If you are thinking this might sound nu, because its a new band, your'e dead wrong. They sound like an uncovered sludge-metal band from say 1975. Buy this album if you like sludgy power southern rock, Black Sabbath-esque doom, or Pantera-ish thrash like music. Believe me, you won't be let down.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Not since 'Done by the Forces of Nature' by the JB's have I enjoyed a CD in it's entirety!! Kanye, you've enhanced this rap game with actual talent! And I thank you!!
B00005UW85|2.0|I bought this by mistake.  This copy of Mclintock is terrible.  It's pan and scan and a bad transfer to boot. The colors are dull and blurry.  This movie is unwatchable.<br />Having said all this, there is another DVD in this two pack.  On it are Blue Steel and Hell Town(or Born to the west). I had never seen an early John Wayne movie.  Having watched both, I have a new respect for John Wayne as an actor.<br />The image on Blue Steel is very good.  I'd say about 95% is crisp.  For example, Wayne rides a white horse that is a vibrant white.  There are a few frames that are washed out and murky.  Overall this seems to be a good quality copy.  The sound on this copy though isn't good.  There is alot of hissing and dropout.  The story is engaging.<br />Hell Town is Blue Steel's opposite.  The image is dull and murky, but the sound does not have alot of hiss.  Again this is an engaging, interesting story(with Wayne starting as a bad seed).<br />Overall I would stay away, unless you want a good copy of Blue Steel.
B0000UMD00|5.0|P!nk has done it once again with Try This. This album yet again shows her range of talent and exactly how far she can take it. From R&B, to Pop-Rock, to Punk-Rock, P!nk has done it all and done it all successfully. People who give Try This a bad rating are only doing so because they can't wrap their little \\"pop- saturated\\" minds around her message in this album. They just wanted to hear the same music over and over again from her and that ain't gonna happen! P!nk made a quote a long time ago saying, \\"I'm gonna make the music I want to make, not music people think I should make. If you wanna come along for the ride then that's cool, but if you don't that's cool too.\\" I know I'd rather listen to someone who is truly creative and takes chances, rather than some \\"cut-out pop princesses\\" who do everything their records companies tell them too just to sell records. And I think we all know who I am talking about. Long after Buttney and Icktina are gone, P!nk will still be rockin' out!!!
B000002JS6|5.0|From the first track to the last, AC/DC shows the world that Rock N Rock is alive and well.<br />A solid rocker that shows the strength of the band and the release that they will be best known for, earning them their place in rock history.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This movie set the ultimate standard when it comes to quality in western movies. Perhaps we will never see such brilliance again. Sergio Leone has made a flawless film, accompanied by a flawless and immortal soundtrack composed by the living legend Ennio Morricone. Morricone's main theme is one of the most beautifull pieces I have heard in my life, and represents some of the best in film music.<BR>I wish that there was something that I could put my finger on, but it's just impossible! This movie is an example of pure perfection - a masterpiece!
0812550706|2.0|This was another book club selection. It was a quick, easy read - but left no real impact. A pure pleasure read - if you're into science fiction, that is. I thought the end was overly contrived...too cute. It was almost as is Card was getting as tired of the battle room as I was. Then, as if to suddenly try to redeem the book as more than just a video game fantasy, he rapidly ages his characters and gives them conscience struggles. <br />All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. It's harmless, and there are worse books to read - but there are so many better ones out there, why waste the time? I'm just glad that I didn't shell out any money for my copy!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin has created something amazing.  His vocals are pure and heavy.  Every song on this cd tells a story, stories that all of us can relate to.  DeGraw is one of the best new artists!  This is THE must have album of the year.
B000065U1N|4.0|&quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; is a hard-to-watch portrayal of recent real-life events during the U.S. humanitarian mission to Somalia in 1992.  It's hard to watch because it provides such a realistic look into a very difficult episode in American military history.  You may recall that this is the mission that opened with news teams meeting the Navy Seals with glaring camera lights as they swam in to the beach in the wee hours of the morning.  It's also the mission that saw a ragtag force of ill-trained but heavily armed thugs under the command of Mohammad Farah Aidid ambush American troops whose job it was to bring desperately needed humanitarian aid to the starving people of Mogadishu.  Aidid had a vested interest in making sure that the American mission failed and the country remained unstable -- he controlled the meager food supplies in the area, and so wielded immense political influence which he was not about to relinquish without a fight.<br />So it was that one day an American ground convoy under surveillance of several UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters wound its way into the heart of the sprawling slums of Mogadishu.  Its mission was to seize two prominent leaders in Aidid's faction.  The mission began well enough, with the &quot;targets&quot; being captured as planned.  However, Aidid's forces had been alerted to the American mission, and laid ambush positions throughout the city.  The escaping American convoy as well as their Blackhawk escorts quickly came under heavy small arms and RPG fire.  Soon two helicopters were crashed in the streets, with their surviving crew members fighting for survival against hopeless odds.  Troops were rushed to the crash sites to try to effect a rescue, but both the Rangers and special ops troopers, as well as some members of the 10th Mountain Division, found themselves battling for their lives against a seemingly limitless enemy force with vast local numerical superiority.<br />The results of the encounter were devastating.  None of us will ever forget the news images of dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets.  The news of heavy casualties took complacent, overconfident Americans by surprise.  I was serving in the 10th Mountain Division at the time, although not personally deployed to Somalia, and I remember my own shock and horror at the images of what had befallen my fellow soldiers.<br />&quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; captures this entire tale in a gritty, action-packed, suspenseful way, from the perspective of the soldiers on the ground.  It highlights the ugly side of human nature, along with ample depictions of courage and sacrifice.  Admittedly it is very sympathetic in its portrayal of the Americans, but I don't see this as detracting from the film at all given the historical realities of the situation.  Aidid and his followers were decidedly unworthy of sympathy, and are portrayed accordingly.  Watch it and decide for yourself.  I, for one, look forward to seeing this movie again.of us will ever forget the news images of dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets.

B000068QY7|5.0|Yeah yeah yeah....I know.... 5 Stars?!?!?! I must be crazy! Well, that's true but, that is NOT why I rated this album SO highly. The truth is, this is a GREAT album! The problem is that, for those who are not fans of the Gallagher Brothers and their schtick, these guys have hyped themselves beyond reality and, therefore, the measuring stick is a mile long and a centimeter wide. Certainly not enough room for mere mortals and certainly not enough room for the supposed &quot;Greatest Band In England&quot; to put out anything less than songs that make the angels weep and the choir sing.<br />But even at their most mediocre, the Gallagher Boys are still 'Head and Shoulders' better than MOST of the rest. Look...how many of the more recent albums of the Rolling Stones do you recall? Every great band eventually comes back down to earth, even if only for a short period of time. Now, that is NOT to say that this album should be discounted as just a blip in an otherwise stellar career. Nope...the music on this album, for the most part, is engaging, classic, rock and roll. Is it groundbreaking? No. Is it seminal? No. But neither were the Rolling Stones after Exile on Mainstreet and, neither were the Beatles after Sgt. Pepper's. Does that mean it isn't great? Absolutely NOT! So then, what we have is a great band taking their sound to it's pinnacle, to its absolute.<br />Someone once said that before you can evolve, you must first exhaust all other avenues available, and that is exactly what the Boys from Madchester are doing.
B0000027RL|5.0|for those interested in spreading the jam, this album is the place to start.  <br />play it loud, play it often...
B000084T18|2.0|Ok ill admit before half the world started listenin to 50 I was listenin to his old cd's like &quot;Guess Whose Back&quot; and &quot;Power Of The Dollar&quot; which were cool he was tryin to rap and he was decent then in 8-Mile when he spits in the song &quot;Places To Go&quot; I thought he was gettin better so I rushed to go comp. this album and once I really listened to it like I did my first 2Pac album I said: &quot;this man is a sell out&quot; he clearly did not have the drive to produce music and doesnt understand what REAL rap is about. This CD is made for 14 year old teenage girls and 50 cant rap. at least not anymore as for G-unit Lloyd banks can rhyme some ok metaphors but its the same old tiring bull ish. My point is this is just another Puff Daddy resembling poppy beat only album so dont go buy it if you listen to real rap like: 2pac, Biggie,Kool G Rap, Canibus, DMX, Jedi Mind Tricks, De La Soul, Pharoah Monch and so on.Hope I saved you some cash.
0393307050|5.0|Having read the entire series twice through, I am a huge fan and can not say enough about O'Brian.  <br />But before talking about the book itself, I will point all of you to the wonderful unabridged audiobook versions performed by (as opposed to simply &quot;read by&quot;) Patrick Tull and produced by Recorded Books, LLC.  They are vastly superior to any other audiobook productions of the series I have listened to (including the versions sold here on Amazon, unfortunately).  For those who have difficulty with the pacing or the language, the audiobook format brings it all to life with amazing clarity. The accents, the tones, the emotion, they are all there in Tull's masterful rendition.<br />Having said that, I will turn to the book itself. Master and Commander (and the entire series) brings the past to life with more immediacy than any other historical novel I have ever read.  After spending some time in O'Brian's world, you truly feel at home there, even those of us who know (or at least knew) very little about things nautical or the history of the Napoleonic Wars.  The characters become your friends, the ships become familiar surroundings.  You come to be in tune with the period even though it is alien to our own times in so many ways.<br />There is also a great deal of humor in these novels, something unexpected in such literate works. The action is phenomenal, the character development (within the book, but especially over the series) is engrossing.  The language is brilliant and sophisticated, but at the same time earthy and &quot;real&quot;.<br />All in all, I would have to agree with the New York Times that these are the best historical novels ever written.
0066620996|2.0|Jim Collins is trying to find the characteristics of what makes a good company a great company. His findings are supported by an extensive analysis of 1,435 companies for a period of 30 years. He uses a scientific approach to analyze his data and his results provide good information however, I have to disagree with the fundamental assumptions and definitions he used to present the idea. The Webster's dictionary defines great as \\"markedly superior in character or quality\\" and the same dictionary defines quality as \\"degree of excellence\\". The author's definition of great is only based on stock market returns to investors. The investors would probably agree with his definition of great because they want to maximize their returns but a company should not be evaluated only for the money it can produce. Abraham Lincoln summarized the idea for an institution to exist when he said, \\"Determine that the things can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.\\"     Companies are created to make money but at the same time they should provide a contribution to our society. For this reason it is very difficult for me to categorize a company such as Philip Morris as a great company. The damage caused by tobacco products is a well known fact and the use of tobacco has been linked to lung cancer and many other diseases. This means that when Philip Morris is making lots of money, many people are causing serious damage to their health.     Wells Fargo is also listed as a great company. Reading today's news I found that Wells Fargo was close to losing its mortgage license in the state of California for unfair lending practices the California Department of Corporations said occurred when 15,000 home owners were overcharged $38 million in fees. The bank claimed it had reimbursed the home owners and regretted the incident, but the state said it had to file a suit against the bank to force repayment. These type of practices could show money in the company's portfolio that was nor necessarily made using a model of excellence. Also ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) released a report charging the San Francisco-based lender with predatory lending practices. ACORN said that Wells Fargo Bank and its subsidiary, Wells Fargo Financial, which caters to sub-prime borrowers, engages in predatory lending practices in low income and minority neighborhoods. I don't think this is a characteristic of a great company.     I also found an article about another \\"great\\" company. An EPA statement released back in December of 2000 entitled, \\"U.S. REACHES ENVIRONMENTAL SETTLEMENT WITH STEEL MANUFACTURER NUCOR\\". The statement reads \\"Nucor Corporation Inc. will spend nearly $100 million to settle a environmental suit alleging that it failed to control the amount of pollution released from its steel factories in seven states, under an agreement reached today with the Justice Department and the EPA. This is the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer.\\" I consider that the performance of a company is important because companies are created to make money. However, when a company is going to be evaluated, like I mentioned before, the ability to make money should not be the only factor considered. When companies incur in illegal practices it is because it maximizes their returns and minimizes their expenses. This could help a company show impressive market performance without showing the real price that the consumer is paying.         There are other mechanisms that evaluate the performance of a company using a broader approach. For example the Malcolm Baldrige Award given by the President of the United States to businesses-manufacturing and service, small and large-and to education and health care organizations that apply and are judged to be outstanding in seven areas: leadership, strategic planning, customer and market focus, information and analysis, human resource focus, process management, and business results. It is interesting to mention that from 1990 to 1995 none of the companies identified by Jim Collins as great companies won the Baldridge Award.    In addition to disagreeing with the definition of \\"great\\", I think there are external factors that impact, in a negative or positive way, the performance of a company. These \\"business environment\\" factors that can not be controlled by companies, should be considered when analyzing the performance of a specific business. For example, after the terrorists attacks of the 11th of September significantly impact the travel industry. Airlines, hotels, car rental companies, restaurants and many others lost a significant part of their business. On the other hand companies selling chemical/biological attack protection were and probably are still making more money than before the attacks.    Many companies are highly dependent on their \\"business environment\\" to make money and the companies listed by Jim Collins are no exception. The headline of an article published last July reads, \\"Nucor's Profit Drops 86%\\". The reason for the drop according to the article are that the average cost of scrap metal per ton increased $25 from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003, and total energy costs increased around $4 per ton from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003. Also it says that the U.S. steel industry, suffering from rising health-care and pension costs, has seen more than 35 producers file for Chapter 11 since 1997. I also found an article from last July about Kimberly-Clark. The headline reads, \\"Profit Dips at Kimberly-Clark\\". The reason that the article provides for their profit slip is that pension expenses rose and energy and raw material costs increased, factors that Kimberly-Clark can not control. Companies need to be flexible in order to adapt to these changes but they can not control their business environment even if they have all the elements of a \\"great\\" company.
B00005JMEW|3.0|OK, first things first.  It's really violent.  I don't think I give anything away there.  Second, it has a few really cool visual effects.  After a while though, one gets the feeling that Tarantino has put together a pretty silly story in order to pay homage to a genre that he loves.  I guess he's entitled to do that, but I won't be running out to buy it.  There is always something much too strong for the average stomach in QT's films, and this one is no exception.  The trucker/comatose-victim 'joke' is just sick.
B0001Z363W|3.0|(...)the musicianship was good but was all misplaced....the solos were screaching while the piano was playing something mellower...sounds like Zakk was trying a bit too hard on some of the tracks...I personally think this is worst record to date...go buy Book of Shadows or Pride and Glory if you wanna check out some of his slower material cause this one dont hold a candle....
0312995423|1.0|Being a Computer Science Major, I usually stay away from technothrillers, but having reading Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I was optimistic. Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed. While Dan Brown's other books may be well researched, this one was not. The numerous technical mistakes, impossible programs, and bad jargon forced me to forget everything i had ever learned about computers just to continue to the next page. The characters flat and one dimensional: the fiercely independent hacker, the loyal workaholic, the innocent professor, the list goes on and on. Further, to force the already shaky plot forward, Brown relies on a seemingly miraculous series of well intentioned, but otherwise stupid individuals. Finally, Brown's thesis for the novel seems to center on the innate good of the NSA and their ability to spy on the communications of every person in this country. He constantly derides the EFF as a bunch of crazy liberal hackers, who are hoplessly naive.  <br />Overall, I believe this book has soured me on all of Dan Brown's work. He's lost a reader here.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|If you like low-fi garage-band antics, and if you have a sense of musical humor, you will probably like these horny rock and roll caveman boogie-ists.  Some of the lyrics provide hilarious instant singalongs, as in \\"Kiss The Devil\\" and \\"Whorehoppin'\\".  The good-timey \\"San Berdoo Sunburn\\" makes me want to go on a debauched roadtrip.  Every song seems to have at least one reprise.  The vocals aren't impressive, but they fit the music well, sometimes sounding like Neil Young might sound on strange drugs or with a hangover.  The drumbeats aren't played with much polish, but they rock in genuine gut-bucket style, often echoing John Bonham or Charlie Watts, at least in spirit.  The guitars are often raw-sounding... the solos aren't terrific, but the crunchy rhythm playing is fantastic in places.  As for the instrumentation and arrangements, I was surprised to find myself enjoying something that mainly features only vocals, drums and electric guitars (\\"What, no bass?\\"  I got over that quickly enough.)  When this formula all comes together, I find it quite enjoyable.  The CD has its ups and downs, but on the whole it's the real deal in that it really does rock me, and it makes me smile.  I wouldn't consider this a Desert Island CD, but I would certainly call it a rough diamond.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Some people may find the special effects work primitive by todays standards, but for a low-budget film as this is they are excellent and charged with a weirdly supernatural energy; something one never sees today in the big production horror films.<br />However, this review is mainly going to be about the picture format. Evil Dead was filmed in 16mm, which is a full-screen format, not widescreen. <BR>BEWARE of the so called \\"widescreen\\" versions: Book of the Dead Limited Edition, and the other editions from Anchor Bay. Nothing has been added to sides of the picture to make it wider; instead the top and bottom of the film have been cut away to make it look like a modern theatre film. Instead of more, you actually gett less. In some parts of the movie this makes an important differance; in the close-ups of faces, parts like the chins are now gone (...); other important details also disappear, like when the trap-door in the floor opens and we look down into the cellar, the lower edge of the opening is gone, so we don't see the entrance in its whole.<br />The full-screen version is still available, with excellent picture quality, in the Elite Entertainment edition.
B000002ADT|4.0|This is undeniably one of the most important albums of modern jazz. It introduced and popularized the modal approach to jazz improvisation, in which many bars were played in a single scale. The modal approach put a premium on the soloist's ability to improvise interesting melodic lines over very simple chord patterns. This was a radical departure from the previously predominant song-oriented approach that depended on frequent chord changes for harmonic interest. The albums's quintessential cut is &quot;So What&quot; which uses only two chords/scales to create a classic jam.<br />The other thing that's important about this album is the composition of the band. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans were creative geniuses of their instruments. Cannonball Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb were solid stars who helped make this one of the great bands of their time.<br />So why do I rate this album only 4 stars? In part, it's a reaction to the hype surrounding this album. This is an excellent album, but it is no way the greatest jazz album of all time, as some would have it. Substantively, I think this album is a little too cool, a bit too detached. It lacks the intensity and passion of the many other great Miles Davis albums. I think of this as the &quot;easy listening&quot; Miles. Despite this reservation, I certainly recommend this CD for all serious jazz fans.
0739308688|5.0|This book is really excellent.  Martin is the best writer in this genre I have seen.
0553345834|4.0|This book is somewhat over-rated. Some of the chapters are just common sense. But there are also some tricks in 'sales'. The book emphasizes on silence and importance of the silence in negotiation.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I don't know why i keep seeing bad reviews about this cd. Im sorry guys im against you all, because yeah this cd is short but its pure talent in my eyes. Yes &quot;some&quot; songs are longer then others but its all creative music and she makes it worth listening to. Guys, this is not an EP ok this is a CD which she made with fewer tracks but longer songs, thats all. If you like Erykah Badu and you like her creative neo-soul, hiphop style then get this cd. In my eyes this whole cd is good. Her lyrics are amazing and the beat are killer. My fav. tracks are Bump it, Back in the day, Danger, Love of my life worldwide, Woo and Think Twice ( i love Roy Hargrove). Plus, the Bonus track hollywood is amazing so please go get the cd.
B000067CPX|3.0|Good old RHCP, though a lot mellower, but the music is still good for the most part. But Kiedis, as usual, tries to rhyme 5 or 6 lines in a row, and much of it fails to make any sense. Back in their wacky funk days, nonsensical lyrics didn't really seem to matter as much, but when you're doing more poppish ballads, the focus is more on the lyrics, and passages like \\"Did you meet your fortune teller/ Get it off with no propeller/ Do it up, it's always stellar/ What a way to finally smell her\\" and \\"You've got your bit part, Mozart / Hot dart acceleration / <BR>Pop art, pistol chasin'/ Catfight intimidation\\" just don't work. <br />To be fair, there are some plenty of good lyrics on the CD too, but not enough so that too much of the album doesn't sound goofy.<br />1) By The Way-- 8.5/10. My 5th favourite song on the album, the rap-rock song. I listen to a lot of soft music (Sigur Ros, Sarah McLachlan), but RHCP sound so much better when they're not trying to do ballads (\\"Scar Tissue\\" would be a good exception.)<BR>2) Universally Speaking-- 7/10. Eh- I find it kinda boring. But that's my problem.<BR>3) This Is The Place- 9.5/10. Great song, my 3rd favourite. Blunt lyrics, about incest it seems. (\\"Can I smell your gasoline / Can I pet your wolverine? / On the day my best friend died / I could not get my copper clean... / I don't want to do it like my daddy did / I don't want to give it to my baby's kid\\" All in all just a rocking song<BR>4) Dosed- 8.5/10. Really cool California kinda laid-back song. Great guitar work.<BR>5) Don't Forget Me- 10/10. One of my 2 favourite songs on the CD. It uses really simple barre chords, surprising because John Frusciante is known for shredding some really crazy crap with his guitar-- but the minimalism works. \\"I'm the rainbow/ In your jail cell / All the memories of everything you've ever smelled\\"... Great intense chorus too.<BR>6) The Zephyr Song- 4/10. One of those songs where the lyrics just ruin it.<BR>7) Can't Stop- 9/10. Hehe-- really fun song. More like their old stuff.<BR>8) I Could Die For You- 8.5/10. Probably the slowest song on the CD. It's really pretty.<BR>9) Midnight- 2/10. Ehh I just can't stand this song. Sorry. The lyrics don't seem to make any sense at all, and the music is forgettable. Lose the cellos... they sound good in.. songs cellos should be in, but not here<BR>10) Throw Away Your Television- 5/10. Great bass line from Flea, but the song itself isn't anything special. I tend to skip it.<BR>11) Cabron- 7/10. Really cool Latin-influenced song with acoustic guitar that sounds capoed at about the 10th fret. A cool effect.<BR>12) Tear- 9/10. Probably my 4th favourite here. Some people have compared it to the Beach Boys.. I don't know about that, but it definitely has the California thing going. One of the album's few great guitar solos is here.<BR>13) On Mercury- 8/10. Fun song with the old-style sound going, to some extent. Too repetitive though.<BR>14) Minor Thing- 5/10. It's okay. Lyrics are really weak, and drag the track down.<BR>15) Warm Tape- 10/10. Oh Hell yes. Maybe my favourite Chili Peppers song now, this one is just amazing. It's not really like their normal sound, but I think it's amazing.<BR>16) Venice Queen- 7/10. Good guitar work but the song just drags and drags.<br />I guess in the end I'm kind of disappointed with the CD- many hardcore punk-funk fans seem to disown the Chili Peppers for \\"selling out,\\" but since I tend to listen to stuff more like Beck and Wilco, and slower stuff, that's not my reason. RHCP should just stick to their strongpoint, which is making fun + funky songs.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I would like to give a mental salute to all those brave men AND women who died in figting in War World II. The History Channel just gave a presentation of the ten episodes. They were extremely beautiful. As I have written before, it was not about war or \\"blood, guts, and glory.\\" It was about the relationship of the men (soldiers). Their relationships are what held them together. As repeated throughout the episodes and made famous by a Civil War captain: War is Hell. Easy Company went down the hills and through the valley of the shadow of death. <br />Tom Hanks' episode focusing on Mr. Winters and the one about Bastogne and Easy's Christmas in the forest were my favorites. They made me shed a tear, especially when a character I liked and turned on the show to see was killed or injured. One falls down. And then you realize it's the relationships of the soldiers that keep you watching. When you watch a character you really liked and loved to watch, die or get injured, it hits you in the gut. What if I had lived back then and had to fight. If I had been born at that time period and had to serve, hopefully I would serve with soldiers like these.<br />God Bless Easy Company and all the heroes of World War II.
2266079999|4.0|CONTACT is a novel about the global reception of a message from space.  Radio observatories around the world pick up the length-repeating signal and manage to piece the whole thing together.  As the code is broken the signal is revealed to be visual.  When put on a screen for the first time the scientists are treated to the image of Adolph Hitler.  The images are from the German Olympics which were the subject of the first strong television signal broadcast.<br />Underneath the picture data is more hidden data.  This is eventually deciphered to be the blueprints of a device.  As the world reacts to almost indisputable proof that we are not alone the device is built and a team is assembled to test it.<br />Upon activation the scientists find themselves traveling at unimaginable speeds to a distant location.  Each traveler is individually greeted in a form to make them comfortable.  One is greeted by a deceased father.  After glimpsing the almost miraculous peace of this civilization, the travelers return at the exact moment they departed and all of the records of the trip are blank.  Everyone refuses to believe that there actually was a trip except the travelers themselves.<br />While CONTACT starts out on a firm scientific basis that is gripping and well written, I found the novel as a whole to be disappointing.  What starts as good hard-core science fiction quickly transforms into the account of what can only be called a religious experience.  At least one bookstore actually shelved the book in the religion section.  While I personally have no problem accepting both science and religion I felt that this book did a poor job of joining or reconciling the two.  Despite my objections to the plotting I will recommend the book as it is quite well written.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I was always a Fugees fan but this really made me realize just how talented Lauryn Hill is. Every single song on this album is wonderful. Some of my favorites are &quot;To Zion&quot;, &quot;Tell Him&quot;, and &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City&quot;. This CD is just a real joy to listen to and it makes me respect Lauryn Hill so much. I would recommend this CD to anyone because yes, although it's R&amp;B/Hip-Hop people who usual don't like those genres like this CD, and that is just part of it's great appeal.
6304169558|4.0|Some time ago I had the chance to see the movie Twister.  This is a movie about some tornado chasers and the biggest storm system on record.<br />A group of tornado chasers are out to test a new device that will provide researches with enough data to give a fifteen-minute tornado warning (as opposed to the current three-minute warning).  There is a rush to succeed as an evil associate with lots of funding has stolen the idea and is out to get the data first.  Throw in some special effects tornados and the result is Twister.<br />On the side of the good guys is a researcher who has an almost-psychic link with tornados and is thus able to predict their paths better than any instruments.  But then you have the common problem of scale that occurs when special effects are added to live footage.  Half-a-mile looks pretty small in this film.  Half-a-mile is the supposed diameter of the film's final funnel cloud.  Unlike Crichton's other films of this nature, the scientific breakthrough is not lost at the end and therefore the film fails to fit the real world.  But despite these things, this is a edge-of-the-seat, white-knuckle film.  If you like action and tension then this is a film to see.  While, in my opinion, the story is very implausible, the movie succeeds in affecting the audience as planned and that is a rare thing.  So I have to recommend this movie to those who have not seen it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|world war II history ~ actually, any history post-1745 ~ is traditionally of no interest to me.  that is, until i stumbled across the last half of the episode &quot;bastogne&quot; on BBC while living in scotland.  i became instantly engrossed in the episode, even though i knew nothing of the characters, plot, or, even, the name of what i was watching.  subsequent research determined that i had missed the beginning part of the mini-serieis and would, in fact, miss the final episodes before i figured out what was going on.  imagine my thrilled surprise to see the series aired recently on the history channel!  i was addicted instantly ~ my life revolved around watching the episodes, telling everyone i knew about them and, frankly, annoying the heck out of my friends by recapping each morning in the office, generally accompanied by tears or anger ~ &quot;they killed blithe!&quot; or &quot;and then toye got hit, and guernere went to get him ... oh, lord, don't get me started on buck compton!&quot;  and so on .... finally some wonderful friends bought me this DVD version so i can watch it whenever i want!  (true friends!!)<br />i recommend this mini-series to anyone who is interested in history, heroism, or simply stories of friendship and survival.  it is brilliantly acted and the changing narration allows the viewer to witness the war through the eyes of officers, privates and medics, and to focus on the company and their relationships as whole, not to mention the soldiers as individuals.  the documentary is an excellent way to delve deeper into the series as well as to observe how the war truly affected the men who served, not to mention their children and grandchildren.<br />and props to brit actor damian lewis (lieutenant/captain/major richard lewis) for his american accent ~ took me a few minutes to recognize soames!
B000002UB6|4.0|While the earliest Beatle albums have more energy than Let It Be, this album is better than the studio enhanced results of Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Mystery Tour or Abbey Road.  The White Album has a bit of this albums raw attraction, but there are too many subpar tracks on it.<br />You can actually hear the individual instruments.  A good return to their roots. The bright spots: I've Got A Feeling, The Long &amp; Winding Road, Get Back.  The low spot: Across the Universe.  Overall, OK.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I've always loved the Digital Cable channel The-N: it shows great teenage-esque shows yet they show things in a different, more explict light. I can say &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; is one these types of shows. At first, I didn't even know a show like this excisted but, while I was searching for the next-to greatest show of all&quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;,I saw it. I was blown away by it's brilliance! Though it was only One-Season long it seems much better than certain shows that have been on much longer.<br /> The DVDs themselves aren't as bad as people say. Sure the picture quality isn't the best but it still's great. The lack of special features is fine with me because the shows are much more important. Plus, special features would kind of ruin the feel of this show: it's supposed to be the bare facts and the features prove it. The only complaint about the DVDs are that their are only a small number of episodes per disc. Friends, thouht only 20 mins long, fits 25 episodes on four-discs but this show with only 19 episodes covers five discs(?). I wonder if the number of discs has to do with the expensive price but trust me it's worth it.<br /> Comfort this show, love it, live it, and enjoy<br /> Other Recommendations: &quot;Degrassi: TNG&quot;
B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus was my favorite movie since I had first seen it in 1986. The whole affair is pretty special to me. Naturally the music, the scenery, the characters all make this one of the greatest movies of all time, only to be replaced by Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart as my favorites.<br />I went out to get the Director's Cut version and have to say, as with most deleted scenes, there is a good reason they are deleted. While it does fill in some holes in the plot, they take away from the original release's magic, and ruin the feel as it was intended. I dumped the Director's Cut and am more than happy with the original DVD release where I cannot tell any difference in picture quality, and it would seem the sound is better.<br />Five stars for this excellent movie....-5 stars for the piece of crap Director's Cut release. Save your money and enjoy the movie as it was intended.
0618526412|4.0|This wistful tale of alienation, oppression, and self-inflicted persecution, is a marvelous read.  McCullers (only in her early-20s when she wrote this) poetically weaves the sights, sounds, and even the smells of the era to recreate the zeitgeist of the Jim Crow South.  Kudos to Ms. Winfrey for reminding us about this wonderful story.<br />For a modern-day twist on these familiar themes, there's another young writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito.  His debut novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE.  He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read.  You can check him out and read the excerpt at: [...]  Don't miss it!
B000002WYT|1.0|This has to be one of the worst purchases I have ever made!! The whole CD is basically a total waste of plastic. The song &quot;crash into me&quot; is too stupid for words, and the the &quot;proudest monkey&quot;, would make a great song to get a criminal confess to anything if he was locked up in a small room and had to listen to this trash for a couple of hours. After listening to this dribble I'll stick to my Nate King Cole, Tony Bennett, who can actually sing and not have to sing about &quot;monkeys&quot;!!!!!!!!!
B0001BKAEE|1.0|The Chairman's Rating: 2/10<br />This movie is Sanctimonious Tripe!<br />Just when you hoped that Matrix: Reloaded was a fluke, you find out that it wasn't.  It was the original Matrix that was the fluke.<br />This movie is the poster child for the 'WCS' award (Would'a, Could'a, Should'a).  No, correct that.  This one earns a special WCS Lifetime Achievement Award.<br />Everything that made 'The Matrix' the phenomenon it was (such that I use the reference Pre-Matrix and Post-Matrix when describing special effects or sci-fi thereafter) was missing from this movie.  Everything important, everything meaningful to the true Matrix storyline was either glossed over or run together in horribly placed soliloquies, as if to say, 'Get the storyline over with so we can get back to spending all of our $ on the special effects, Maaaan' (spoken with 70's hippie drawl)  To me, using special effects in film is akin to matching perfect wine (special effects) with the right food (storyline) .  The food (storyline) must come first and is the most important.  If the wine (special effects) is overbearing,  the entire experience falls flat.  The Wachowski brothers had two paths to go down after The Matrix: 1) true sci-fi storyline and a mind expanding plot, spiced with special effects; or 2) special effects to impress the 13 year-old kids to buy lots of stuff.  The chose the latter, and the viewers have suffered the consequences.<br />The few pieces of good storyline were totally overshadowed.    However, kudos to an admirable job by Mary Alice as the Oracle.   With the loss of Gloria Foster, Ms. Alice was given a tough role and given no script with which to work, she managed to pull it off.<br />With the exception of Neo, anyone really doing anything was non-white, female or both.  The true beauty/genius of The Matrix was that you never noticed race or gender.  The characters were written so well and performed so brilliantly by the cast that it made no difference at all.  I loved it andwas hoping for lots more of the same in future releases, in essence eliminating stereotypes.  In Revolutions, the politically-correct stereotypes were jammed in the viewers faces constantly.<br />There were more cliches in this movie than sentinels. In the 'finest' Independence Day tradition: Tough, old grizzled <BR>Marine yelling at the 16-year old kid, the 'Give 'em hell' speech, the kid 'saves the day', 2 chicks dishin' (rockets, that <BR>is), Jada Pinkett ScreenKiller calling everything 'Baby'.  Jogging instead of running, while trying to escape pursuers?  C'mon, fake the running, at least, but jogging with flattened hands doesn't make anyone appear to be running faster.<br />And after seeing the inhabitants of Zion, all I did was arm-chair General and root for the machines.  I think the sentinels should have been outfitted with white gloves at the end of their tentacles, just so they could 'dope-slap' everyone in Zion.<br />With the choir music and doe-eyes at the mention of the name 'Neo', you can tell that they were hoping to start a belief system akin to the Jedi Knights of Star Wars, thereby propagating the series into lot$ of $ale$.<br />To top it all off, the 'Features' in the 2-CD set: <BR>Links to Web sites (to $ell $tuff)<BR>Matrix Comics (to $ell $tuff)<BR>Matrix Tunnel Game (to $ell $tuff)<BR>(BTW, the Matrix: Reloaded PC Game was rated by many as one of the worst games released in 2003.)<br />For an example of the reverse, take Tomb Raider.  Tomb Raider was a popular video game long before the movies came out.  So when the movies arrived, everyone knew to pretty much check your brain at the door, sit back and be entertained.  Both movies succeeded and were hits because we knew roughly what to expect.  Not so with The Matrix.  It was PRECISELY the LBI (Left the Brains In) Factor that so intrigued everyone in the first place.  To remove that intellectual aspect entirely was a total shock and much more of a letdown than if it were mindless to begin with<br />There is SO much wrong with this film that almost every scene deserves its own paragraph explaining the absurdity of ever putting it to film.  <br />The horrid music pretending to be awe-inspiring<BR>Castrated Morpheus<BR>Jada Pinket ScreenKiller <BR>Zion Council of Sanctimonious Do-Nothings <br />One line sums it up.  Agent Smith, after taking over the matrix and turning it dark, green and rainy, and turning all the people into replicas of himself, asks Neo: `So, how do you like what I've done with the place?'  Frankly, I loved it!<br />Just like Independence Day, this movie was Chinese food for the eyes, i.e. five minutes after watching it, you're hungry.  In fact, minutes after watching it, I was so ticked off that I immediately watched the first 35 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'.  I had to flush this Matrix: REVULSIONS out of my mind and to do it I chose to watch people REALLY fighting, for the RIGHT reasons, for people WORTH saving.<br />Let's face it, Cypher was right all along. 'Why, oh why, didn't I take the BLUE pill?'  After the first Matrix, I ask myself (and the Wachowski brothers) the same thing.
B000099T2L|4.0|Dangerously in Love is a perfect Beyonce Knowles that makes a 'Feed Good' JLO Touch, of coz! If you love to watch JLO dancing on the floor, Beyonce is just 'Terrific' with her sways that makes you fall dangerously in love with her. Crazy in love, Baby Boy, Naughty girl are my three fav songs that I never miss to listen n watch. Beyonce has the talents and she reminds of Donna summer days with her song 'Naughty girl'. Her Baby Boy with Sean Paul is fairly a cool song but let me say Missy Elliot's never been my liking somehow with the Signs though the song is good.  Be with you is a romantic song.Beyonce has a quivering vocal voice with a touch of feel in the heart that one can't resist her spell. Though not all songs great but for a collection, Dangerously in Love is definitely a Good Pick - 'Beyonce Knowles' for a great change and that's Destiny's child! Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great show!  Oh my goodness.  I can't believe how good this is.<br />Everyone should pick this DVD set up.  It's so good.  Even if you don't like sci-fi stuff, this probably has something for you.  Great characters, good writing, good acting, great plots, AWESOME over-arching story.<br />Everyone should get this.<br />~~KEITH
B00009V7RF|4.0|I just love to listen and watch them! Elephunk is a superb Album especially if you've loved 'Eminem'' Nope, I won't compare coz Black Eyed Peas has their own delightful singing sensation with the astounding spell and their Hip Hop music. They make you groove with friends or all alone even in the middle of the night. I love their all tracks but 'Shut Up' and 'Hey Mama' are my two fav numbers. B.E.P. with Fergie is more the merrier with her expressions and captures attention with her rapping. Let's get Retarded is a nice beat that gets to Party everybody! Fly Away is quite good but the one with Justin Timberlake 'Where is the Love' is an inviting change. A good Party Album for the Hip Hop dance lovers - Cool for Summer Nights! Pick them for Once and you won't regret B.E.P. - My Choice Pick, of coz.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|I loved the way that a most uncommon friendship formed between 2 most different people. Who would have thought that Sean Connery fitted into a role such as this, but it was very clever to see it all develop. I've always enjoyed the melancholy acting of F. Murray Abraham, and once again he proves that he is perfect for the role. It was the first movie where I realized that Busta Rhymes acted on the side.I thought he almost played a key role as the ideal big brother, and showed the genuine love for Jamal that some siblings never experience. Rob Brown, awesome. A talented young basketball player who learns that he is also a talented writer.<br />One thing that I love are some of the comments that Brown and Connery come out with in this. Brown: &quot;You read all these, man?&quot; Connery: &quot;No, I just have them to impress all my visitors.&quot; Another one I like is, &quot;Bolt the door... if you're coming in.&quot; But my favorite line throughout the whole film as to be one you probably would never expect from someone like Sean Connery. He booms, &quot;PUNCH THE KEYS!!!&quot; and Jamal punches the keys, and then he proceeds to say, &quot;You're the man now, dog!&quot; Who's gonna forget that! Ha!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Think this time Anastacia hitted a homerun! The best album I've ever heard! It is a real joy to listen to this music.
B000002GKT|5.0|one of the best LIVE albums ever.right next to the allman brothers fillmore live one.a must i repeat A MUST FOR ANY HARD ROCK OR HEAVY METAL HEAD.
B00000K0T8|5.0|During 1996, a lot of good CDs dropped (&quot;Hell On Earth&quot;, &quot;It Was Written&quot;, &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot;, etc.).  Somewhere lost in the shuffle, a superhero stood with a superb album &quot;Ironman&quot;.  Backed by his Wu-Gambino Raekwon, he does no wrong. My personal favorites are &quot;Assassination Day&quot;, &quot;Daytona 500&quot;, and of course, &quot;All That I Got Is You&quot;.  This album further established Wu as a force in the hip-hop game.  The thing that I liked about Wu solo albums so much was that every one of their joints was also a family affair.  Hope Wu-Tang (as a whole) can return to form and dominate the game once again.  Peace.
0440237688|1.0|I think that this book is SO boring! If you get past the first chapter and like it you are just plain ODD!
B00005JKCF|4.0|Marvel comics have brought comics into the 21st century with very exciting films that was started with the x-men. Not only do they honour the comics of old with their screen adaptations, but draw a new audience into their fantasy worlds. Two big thumbs up to the crews who have made these comics into action-packed films for all to enjoy. Top work lads.
B00005B36H|3.0|When this was first released, I was disappointed. &#34;This doesn't seem to be as good as Aenima. The songs just aren't as memorable, not as catchy, not as strong. Not as good.&#34; But I was astute enough to realize that this might have been because the album was brand new and my expectations were too high and maybe I just needed to give it some time to grow on me. Well, that was three years ago. I've listened to this album many, many times since it came out, and after much pondering and consideration, I've arrived at my final conclusion:<br /><br />It just ain't that great. Tool's weakest effort since Opium. Sounds like they felt obligated to do a new album and they forced themselves before they were ready. Here's to hoping the next one is back up to their standards.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Also I have been a Amazon costumer for more than 5 years, this is the first time I'm reviewing a DVD bought here. Firefly itself was good enough as a reason. <BR>Thanks a lot to all the positive reviews that made me buy it!!:-)<br />Being a fan of high quality scifi I have been looking for a touching, inspiring and at the same time action packed new concept for a pretty long time.<br />Firefly is a real gem in this genre. It would a true waste not to develop this fascinating and genuine story concept any further.<br />It's worth watching and buying!
B000007T1M|5.0|I'd say this is System of a Down's 3rd best album to date (behind Toxicity and Mezmerize). I'd also like to point out that this is worth about 3.5 to 4 stars, but the first time I reviewed it, I thought differently (this is an update...about 2 years later)    1. Suite-Pee 9/10 A great opener for a great album, heavy and fast.    2. Know 10/10 The second best song on the CD more fast beats and heavy guitars.    3. Sugar 9/10 Another upbeat, almost (and again I say ALMOST) rap-like song, featuring some terrific bass.    4. Suggestions 9/10 Less upbeat overall, but does have some very heavy parts. Very catchy acoustic intro.    5. Spiders 9.5/10 Slowest song on the album, but still awesome.    6. DDevil 8/10 Upbeat guitars, maniacal vocals, strange lyrics. Typical System of a Down    7. Soil 9/10 Another great, heavy song with fairly deep lyrics about losing a friend to suicide.    8. War? 10/10 Great guitars and effects. Lyrics ridiculing religious war.    9. Mind 7/10 My least favorite song on the album, but only because it is rather unfocused and a bit too long.    10. Peephole 8/10 A bit spooky...sounds rather like carnival music during the verses    11. CUBErt 10/10 Great song! At less than a two minutes, however, it is way to short.    12. Darts 8/10 Heavy, but not overly imaginative.    13. P.L.U.C.K. 15/10 I give it a 15 because it is just that good! Best song on the album and possibly SOAD's best to date (through \\"Steal This Album!\\")
B00005JMEW|5.0|Well, I actually saw this movie at the cinema in Bangkok, Thailand. It was an awesome experience I hadn't had in a long time. Uma Thurman rocks!! She was like a killing machine of justice and redemtion. Taratino was excellent. He is a very fantastic directer. Now, I have bought my favorite movie on DVD and I can't stop watching it. I'm waiting for Volume 2 to come out in Thailand and I can hardlt wait!!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|First, I have to say that I adore this move and its soundtrack. The phrase \\"feel good movie\\" is such a cliche' but it's true for this movie. With that said, I have to agree with a fellow reviewer. The porn stand-ins story line is not necessary. While it's funny on an absurd, titillating level, the graphic nature of the scenes means that I don't feel comfortable sharing this movie with friends or family and that's a shame. I initially saw the movie in a packed theater and was shocked and embarrassed when these scenes appeared.<br />It's a sweet movie otherwise and has the potential of becoming a perennial holiday favorite. I second the suggestion to make a PG-13 version of this on a subsequent DVD by deleting the unnecessary story line.
0671027344|5.0|Seriously.  I love this book oh so much.  Honestly, I just might be in love with Charlie.  We do have quite a bit in common.  It was nice to read about a boy who actually had feelings and was not afraid to talk about them, a boy with some depth... there just aren't enough of those.  In literature or otherwise.  Sorry guys, if there are any of you I haven't met you.  But anyhow, this book is very very very good and I highly recommend it.  Especially if you too have thought of yourself as a wallflower.
B00005A46T|4.0|You people have to grow up.  Slipknot is not an underground band.  They are a heavy as hell band that blew up.  They have a perfect studio sound because they have the money, and the backing.  How can you hold this against them?  The fact of the matter is that they are making extreme metal which happens to be getting large exposure.  If they were a no-name band under relapse or metalblade records, you would all be on their nuts.  Just another case of hating.  This album is just as good or better than the first; they are a talented band.
0380789035|5.0|Fantasy is not my thing -- at least, it wasn't until I read &quot;American Gods,&quot; drawn in by the excellent premise that immigrants brought their gods to America, then forgot them, leaving the gods to decline until they finally decide to do battle with Americans' new gods, such as technology.<br /><br />This gets five stars despite a somewhat naff ending, where Gaiman seems to struggle to decide exactly how he wants to end the book. In spite of that, it's worth the read. This is a book with great characters (Shadow, Wednesday, Laura), great places (especially the roadside attractions) and a surprising sense of humor that saw me laugh out loud several times. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0446677450|5.0|I really think some people miss the point of this book; it is really very simple.  The author does not under-value education, nor is he obsessed about money. He believes that if we strengthen our &quot;financial IQ&quot; we take responsibility for our finances and our wealth grows.  An increase in wealth gives us more time to enjoy the things that are really important to us, like spending more time being with the ones we love and doing the things we want to do. This was a great book.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game came out originally in Europe, so our friends discovered it a couple of years ago.  It's the only strategy game I know where a 5-year-old can play against his father and (sometimes) win.  Definitely fun, and different every time you play.
B0001Z363W|3.0|I think a lot of the reviewers are making the mistake if comparing this album to BLS' previous two original offerings. Zakk's goal was not to outdo himself in that particular style, but to go back to the so called &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; style. For fans of that style, I think this album is a moderate success. For those of us who enjoy his heavier style, then this album is what it is. On a music basis, I enjoy most of the tracks, and really like about three of them. That said, as I am a member of the latter group, to me this album is mediocre at best. I like Zakk's usual trio (more or less) of slow songs on his heavier albums, so maybe the style is more tolerable in small doses. Not to mention that it leaves room for creativity in that he isn't just trying to fill an album. Three stars.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is the very best CD I have ever purchased.  I'm in college, so people are always amazed I know every single Elton song by heart.  It's because I listen to this CD over and over again and cannot ever get sick of it.  I love how it goes from beginning to current songs.  It's great to hear his voice grow and improve with every song.  I have the bonus CD that came with 4 extra songs, and his duet with George Michael on Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me is the very best duet I have ever heard, EVER! The ONLY thing wrong with this CD is they put on here the song Little Jeanie and left out Recover Your Soul.  Other than that, this CD will be the best purchase you could ever make if your a huge Elton fan like I am! I just saw Elton John and Billy Joel perform together in concert last year, and all they need to do now is put out a CD of singing their songs together like they sang in concert, and life would be perfect!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Butterfly Effect<br />It is likely that a number of reviews are going to describe The Butterfly Effect as a \\"science fiction\\" movie. Little that occurs during the course of this film relates to science or technology, and to force The Butterfly Effect into the genre. There is a \\"Twilight Zone\\" feeling to the movie, because it's along the line between fantasy and horror.<BR>Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a college student with a bigger parcel of emotional baggage than most young adults. Since age seven, he has been experiencing blackouts at moments of high emotional stress, such as when a friend of the family molested him, or when he and some friends became involved in a prank-gone-bad. Evan learns that, by concentrating on the words in a journal he composed while growing up, he can transport himself back in time and re-live certain events. Sometimes, he can make changes; sometimes he can't. When a childhood friend, Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart), commits suicide because of something Evan does, he becomes obsessed with reworking her life. And, when he does, he learns that he might have been better off not meddling with the complex formula of cause-and-effect. The ending is a cheat, and Ashton Kutcher is perhaps not the best choice for the lead role. Nevertheless, despite these flaws, I don't hesitate to recommend the film but not recommended for childern.
0671027573|1.0|This is the first attempt at reading Linda Howard that I have ever made.  I wish I had not started with this book.  She writes well, but the plot is over the top dumb.  A few friends in a bar decide what qualities make the perfect man, and all of a sudden they are overnight celebrities?!?  Yeah, because women in bars don't talk about what they would like from a man every single day.  And the 'villian' in the story is painfully obvious from the first few chapters, before the crime even takes place.  This book was so dumb that I couldn't finish it.  I just skipped ahead to see if everything that I thought would happen did, and I was right.  I might be willing to give this author another try, but if I do, it's gonna be a library book!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye will never be greater then tupac or biggie. But Kanye is the greatest thing that has been in the rap game since Tupac-lyrically. Kanye West, next big thing. Finally some truly excellent rap.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|It's quirky.  It's weird.  It's memorable.  And it has a cool soundtrack.<br />Think \\"American Beauty\\" style satirical family commentary, throw in equal measures of teen angst, mental illness, time travel and one hilarious monologue on the sex life of the smurfs and you get the idea.  All the ingredients are there for a great film but while I would say the film is certainly Very Good, it never quite pulls all the threads together sufficiently to make it Great.<br />The film opens with our hero Donnie waking up in the middle of the road beside his bike.  We don't know if he was hit by a car or hit by lightening or quite what happened (which sets the tone for the whole movie and in particular the ending - we never quite know what happened).  But one thing is for sure, things started to get weird for Donnie from then on.  (Look out also for the fantastic opening track \\"Killing Moon\\" by Echo and the Bunnymen).<br />Donnie is a moody, troubled teen with a bit of pyromania in his past.  He takes medication for some type of mental illness, fights with his sister, uses bad language at the family dinner table and sleepwalks.  He also hears voices that tell him to come outside at night where he meets a rather sinister six foot bunny rabbit called Frank for the first time who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.  Interested yet?  And it's just as well that Frank wanted to speak with Donnie because while they were chatting about the end of the world a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into Donnie's bedroom.  You've gotta say that's original.<br />The whole mood of the film is fantastically dark and ominous and there are enough twists and turns to hold the interest right the way through.  I've found myself thinking about this movie for some time after having seen it and pondering its themes of second chances and sacrifice.  <br />Where Donnie Darko lets itself down is that it never quite brings together the various threads laid by the large supporting cast.  There is just too much going on.  There's Donnie's girlfriend (is she/isn't she, my what a strange family she has), his father (distant and juvenile), mother (earnest and caring), school teachers (too many to mention other than to say that Drew Barrymore is badly miss-cast and Carter from ER knows more about time travel than he is letting on), a creepy motivational speaker who turns out to be a child molester (Patrick Swayze), Grandma Death (no idea how she was supposed to fit in), a shrink, Donnie's school friends and acquaintances - the list goes on and on.  I'm just not sure what all these characters had to do with the story.  And because there are so many of them, they don't get developed very well and the whole thing just doesn't tie together as neatly as it could.<br />I'd sum it up by calling it an interesting and thought provoking film with interesting themes and a gloriously dark atmosphere.<br />Rent it and see for yourself.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Well First Of All i want to say WELCOME BACK Machine Head Metal has missed you i know i have. Well where to start hmm well this isnt Burn My Eyes as a matter of fact it is alot better i think. I hate that u will get reviews bashing the cd cause it dosent sound exactley like BME does face it that cd is 10 years Old now. I mean if all the MH cds sounded the same as BME it would have gotten boring by the 4th album the experimented The Burning Red had some good songs and even Supercharger had 1 or 2 moments.This cd kinda reminds me of what TBR should have sounded like and let me add one thing Ahrue Luster was a aweful guitarist. well here is a song by song review of the album 1.Imperium-KILLER song possibly the best MH has ever done. 10/102.Bite The Bullet-Melodic to Crushing in one word very versatile song. 10/103.Left Unfinished-My Fav on the cd Xtremely Personal. 10/104.Elegy-Moody Song and perfect for this cd 8/105.In My Presence Of My Enemies-Killer solo by Demmel and Fynn roaring ON YOUR GRAVE I WILL STAND! are the highpoints of song. 9/106.Days Turn Blue To Gray-Another Deep song from Flynn about his parents. 10/107.Vim-WHAT A SOLO from Demmel,Flynn 10/108-Seasons Wither-holy hell what a great addition WOW sounds like they did it with the rest of the album. 10/109.All Falls Down-just a all-out great song Chrous is great 10/1010.Wipe The Tears-Great verses well written he is 1 person in the first verse then in the second verse he is another one great. 10/1011.Descend The Shades Of Night-Great Closer not heavy like the rest of the album personally i think it is the best ending to the album. 10/10 so to conclude dont expect this to be exactley like BME cause it is not more personal and grown up it is better then BME in almost every aspect especially the Drumming Dave Mclain drums his ass off.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Unlike the Kill Bill 1 soundtrack, this one plays like a real album; it's heavy on the substance, with a lineup of full-length songs, but still carries the distinctive style of the movie. 'Goodnight Moon' and 'About Her' reflect the more sober tone of the second part, but nothing better than Johnny Cash's touching cover of 'A Satisfied Mind,' which seems like a very emblamatic song, related to Bill's statements about Pai Mei: &quot;He's a rotten old b*st*rd, and, like all rotten old b*st*rds, he gets lonely.&quot; L'Arena is a very powerful piece, from the eerie opening section to the triumphant swell near the end. 'Malaguena Salerosa' was a good selection for the closing credits, very soulful and reckless.<br />One thing that seems sparse is the dialogue. The few scenes which are selected don't seem like the strongest; where's the 'goldish flapping and not flapping' exchange, the 'you're a terrific person; you're my favorite person, but sometimes...,' or any scene with Budd or Elle? The transition from 'Truly and Utterly Bill' to 'Malaguena Salerosa' is pretty effective, though.
0425170349|1.0|first of all, i bought this book expecting for the thrills. and theres no lack of thrill obviously. but, this is the story for too machoic and selfish people for other PEOPLEs.<BR>main characters lead the story as if they are such a super-man or justice of the peace. they think describing this way is so rightful and powerful(not cool at all ever!!!!).<br />im veryvery disapointed now for buying this, not in rental.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|When I first bought this, after a couple of listens, it seemed like a novelty item without any real merit. I hadn't at the time realized how well Tarentino worked with music, and how integral a part of the film it was. After living with the soundtrack for awhile, then re-watching the movie, a lot of the tracks took on a new value. Some of them sound good to begin with - the long cover of 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,' the decadent 'Battle Without Honor or Humanity,' and the eerily perfect 'The Lonely Shepherd,' but many of them are also notable for their ability to evoke scenes from the movie. 'The Green Hornet Theme,' 'The Grand Duel' and especially 'The Flower of Carnage' are perfectly suited to their scenes, and the musical backdrop from 'Ode to O-Ren' (which is sort of an amusing track in its own right) is used to excellent effect in the hospital scene. All of this really highlights the brilliance and intricacy of Kill Bill; it's like a mediation on the movie.<br />My only complaint, aside from the fact that there are only a few songs here which are really strong on their own merit, is that one of the best pieces in the movie, the chanting that plays when the Bride chops off Sophie's arm, isn't included (it's Morricone's 'Death Rides a Horse,' according to another review here).
076790382X|2.0|This book is, by its nature, a set of disconnected essays written for a London newspaper. That in itself is not bad, except that most of the topics are mundane, trivial, and done better elsewhere. There's an essay on silly warnings on products, for example; another about how confusing tax forms are. The format works better when Bryson writes about culture clash, but too much of the time he comes off as a second-rate Andy Rooney.<br />The other problem -- and this one is more serious -- is that the tone is so tongue-in-cheek, and the humor so exaggerated, that the reader never knows if Bryson is telling us an outrageous fact or if he just made something up. For example, he says \\"in the entire history of commercial aviation no life has been saved by the provision of a life vest.\\" Extremely interesting if true ... but is it?<br />Bryson's prodigious writing talents are much more effective when applied to serious scientific and cultural matters. \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" \\"A History of Everything,\\" and \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" are all well-researched books where the information is factual, and the humor is used to get the point across. These other efforts are far better than this one.
B000000WCX|4.0|this bowie album is by far one of my favorites by him, either you love it, or you hate it. each track uses the drum and bass format and elevates it to a whole new level. bowie takes elements of the electronica he helped invent and adds analog sounds over top: loud guitars, keyboards by brian eno, crazy piano solos (looking for a satellite), etc, with catchy bowie lyrics and melodies making it quite a journey. &quot;i'm afraid of americans&quot; is the standout, blending paranoia with the downright weird (nine inch nails version highly recommended). &quot;7 years in tibet&quot; is also a great song, with an explosive chorus that can only be done by the best. the rest of the album is great, instant bowie classics. why this thing is out of print i have no idea, it's a genius of melody and sound at his best. whenever i need a break from the eddie vedder sound-alikes and mediocre crap on the radio, earthlings is the first place i turn.
0312853254|5.0|Somehow I missed Ender series and when I started to read it now, the first book, 'Ender's Game', didn't impress me so much (I am not saying it was a bad novel, it just wasn't up to the hype surrounding it).  But 'Speaker for the Dead' was totally different. It's more a phylosophical book then just sci-fi (many present sci-fi attributes notwithstanding). It covers many interesting aspects of religion, ethics, etc. The planet and aliens living there are just a background for this book. The only shortcoming for me originate in its advantage - I didn't feel good coonnection with the first book, both in the plot and novel structure and in character development. I would think that Ender in the second book is a totally different person, even taking into the account the age difference. Some plot developments looks unsubstantiated (such as travel to different planets that allowed Ender to stay young), but since that is not a main point in this book (at least for me) it didn't bother me. <BR>I am moving to the next Ender' book.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Tony Montana will get under your skin, will get into your head, and before you know it you'll be talking like him, quoting lines from the movie, and watching it over and over. As gangster movies go, it's probably number three behind The Godfather, and Godfather II. And it's no coincidence that Al Pacino is in all three. Al Pacino does so many things to bring Tony Montana to life; but his most jarring piece of acting comes during the famous chainsaw scene, in his wordless closeup. His facial expression speaks volumes as Tony is stripped of his strut to reveal naked emotion.<BR>   Of course, Al Pacino isn't the only great contributor. Brian DePalma is a terrific director, Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter (and director, but not here); Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Michelle Pfeiffer are no slouches as performers. In retrospect, it seems that it would take an awful lot to make this movie go wrong; but because everyone was at the top of their game, Scarface has become a masterpiece.
B00005ASQ1|2.0|Probably Gus Van Sant`s more mainstream (and uninspired??) movie, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; presents a couple of intriguing moments and ideas yet the result is typical and too close to cliched territory. A coming-of-age story combined with an essay about the writing process, this average melodrama starts well enough but loses its steam halfway through. There`s nothing new here, and some of the plot resembles aspects of the previous (and better) Van Sant`s picture, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Sure, the acting is very convincing and the direction shows some brilliance at parts, but the pacing is too uneven and drags in many moments. &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is also too PC and &quot;pretty&quot;, delivering another awe-inspiring Hollywood piece of fluff that doesn`t dare to challenge the viewer (and Van Sant is usually a challenging director). Overall, this cinematic experience is not a complete disaster but doesn`t manage to impress either, offering a so-so story that has been done before and with better results.<br />Good at parts, a somewhat interesting failure as a whole.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|One of the most surprising and memorable indie gems of the last years, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a gripping and intriguing cult movie and a fine addition to the coming-of-age genre. Well, to define this movie`s genre is not easy, really, since it goes into sci-fi, teen drama, thriller, suspense and black comedy territory. But the most surprising element is that it actually suceeds at combining all that genres. <br />A powerful experience about growing up, the building of personality, communication, schizophrenia and the frontiers between sanity and madness, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a superb achievement. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the confused, smart and offbeat Donnie, that spends most of his time going to school and talking to a giant rabbit. <br />Richard Kelly`s debut as a director is strong and convincing, providing captivating and absorbing cinematography with an unique mood and an ethereal, oniric and dream-like atmosphere (similar to some David Lynch, Atom Egoyan and even Tim Burton works). Delivering enough surrealistic and gothic details, Kelly truly creates a personal and identifiable style here. The haunting score also helps to keep things interesting, capturing the zeitgeist of the eighties and providing a nostalgic dark feeling (Gary Jules` song &quot;Mad World&quot;, a cover of a Tears for Fears hit, is particularly deep and compelling). <br />&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an amazing cinematic experience that wisely focuses alienation in suburbia, giving a peculiar portrait of teen depression and the coming of adulthood in an original way. This is what independent cinema does better, to offer innovative perspectives about old, been-done-to-death subjects. Richard Kelly`s directorial debut is one of the most interesting american movies of the last years that looks like nothing else. A real alien.<br />Highly Recommended.
B00005A46T|1.0|After the Slipknot debut which was treated as a \\"revelation\\" when in fact it was simply pointless noise complete with silly shock tactics (clown masks and \\"serial-killer\\" attire as if there's such a thing) but mostly sub-zero talent, you can't blame the group for going on with this recipe since they found out that, indeed, trash sells.<br />     Not only does trash sell, but Slipknot grasped that the more complicated you make trash to appear the more it becomes appealing. Example: if you were to search a garbage can in hope for something valuable in it, would you search a can which contains only one type of garbage in it, or, would you rather search one where the garbage is nicely mixed and your illusion of actually finding something worthwhile increases?<br />   In reality of course, one might indeed find something worthy in a trash can, but in Slipknot's case you sadly come away only with trash.<br />    For a band that numbers nine people the odds that noone would have any type of talent would be -one would think- small, yet this is exactly the case with this group. What you get is, a couple of screamers (and trust me on this, there's LOADS of people who can scream, watch any horror b-movie for evidence), then a coupla guitarists who spend most of their playing time butchering their guitar chords, a coupla drummers who treat drumming the way a would-be doctor with no licence would treat a patient on the operating table, a guy at the turntables who yawns his way to his paychecks since he doesnt have much to do, and well, all in all, that's about it.<br />   Oh wait. There's of course, the \\"music\\" this band produces. Actually, you could obtain the same results musically -if not better- right at the comfort of your own home, without spending busloads of $$$ at studios and media promotion (the latter was 98% of Slpiknot's budget). All you gotta do is follow my advice and if you get lucky enough to be promoted you'll be hailed as the next best thing to noise pollution:<br />-take a lawnmower, not necessarily a new one, in fact the older and more run-down the better, and get it started near a recording device.<BR>-next to that, put a blender in which you're blending all kindsa screws and nails and run it but with a stop-go approach so you can create the illusion of rhythm.<BR>-next to all that, get a coupla people to operate power-drills on a a hard metal surface,<BR>-this would be alittle more difficult, but you'd need at this point some heavy truck running its engine in full thrust so you can have some beats. If you could somehow get a bulldozer instead, all the better, <BR><BR>-one of your friends (possibly the one with the least suspicion of talent can operate the sampler, so have him play Pantera records over the whole thing but at 45 r.pm-and to reel the result in, get some of your friends to scream over all this on top of their lungs. No need to provide any lyrics since what they'll eventually scream will be directly analogous to the non-fun they will be having.<BR>-repeat the process 11 times so you can have 11 \\"songs\\". If you want, for artistic effect, repeat it once more, so you can have the chance to provide the fans with the all important \\"hidden bonus track\\". On second thought, why not repeat it 45 times so you can have an extra 30 songs which you could release in the future as \\"unreleased tracks from the vaults\\".<br />Tape the whole thing and send it to some labels. I understand that it sounds far-fetched that you'd get a record deal, but hey, Slipknot did...
B000002LR3|3.0|Hailed as one of the key dance albums of the nineties, &quot;Screamadelica&quot; is indeed an important and challenging record, even if its &quot;classic&quot; status seems a bit over the top. True, it mixes a lot of different musical styles and references and delivers an impressive combo that includes electro, gospel, pop, soul, rock, shoegazer, funk and a little of everything else. Yet, it has its share of filler moments as some of the songs sound too dated today (the ordinary dance number of &quot;Don`t Fight It, Feel It&quot; or the tedious &quot;Damaged&quot; and &quot;I`m Comin` Down&quot;). It`s a well-crafted album nonetheless, and a couple of parts truly shine (the hypnotic and dazzling &quot;Higher Than the Sun&quot;, the infectious &quot;Come Together&quot; or the urban hymn &quot;Loaded&quot;). All in all, &quot;Screamadelica&quot; still sounds somewhat fresh and appealing nowadays, even if it has some flaws, and proves the vitality of one of the most innovative bands around.<br />Impressive enough yet far from stunning.
6304140711|5.0|This is a classic.  Reese Witherspoon is so cute, and as if we didn't all know so is Mark Walberg.  Put them together and you've got a hit.  This is my favorite movie ever and I am a video freak.  I couldn't even imagine what was going to happen next.  It was scary yet romantic. I love it, however I wouldn't recommened this movie for anyone under the age of 16
6302032555|2.0|If you have ever seen the movie &quot;10&quot; and not just watched the trailer with the infamous seen of Bo Derek running down the beach with her cornrows bobbing along, then you know that Dudley Moore's fantasy of the perfect woman pops pretty much about the time that Bo's character opens her mouth. That fact pretty much serves as the model for Bo Derek's film career in the early days; she looked great but once she opened her mouth she started losing points. This was amply proven in &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man,&quot; but in case anybody missed the point we have the 1984 film, &quot;Bolero.&quot; The film was subtitled &quot;An Adventure in Ecstasy&quot; in an effort to make everyone forget the other part of the title was a take off both on Derek's first name and the music by Ravel revitalized by &quot;10&quot; (fortunately the Olympic Ice Dancing champions Torvill and Dean gave us a much better association).<br />In &quot;Bolero,&quot; Bo plays Lida MacGillivery, a little rich girl graduating from an English boarding school. Her graduation present is going to be the loss of her virginity, so she and her best friend, Catalina (Ana Obreg&oacute;n), go off to the deserts of Arabia, accompanied by her chauffer/bodyguard Cotton (George Kennedy). On the desert sands she meets a sexy sheik (Greg Bensen), who has his chance, but blows it despite all the Valentino references. When Lida has similar problems with a bullfighter in Spain named Angel (Andrea Occhipinti), we get the idea that this girl is going to have to go around the world, so to speak, to get her happy ending. Consequently, &quot;Bolero&quot; is a soft porn flick without the sex. Just think about that for a while and then it should be very clear to you why this is a bomb of major proportions that falls into the &quot;so bad you have to see it to believe it&quot; category instead of the &quot;so bad it is good&quot; column. Maybe director John Derek did this as a way of telling the adolescent males of the world to stop fantazigng about his wife (actually, Olivia d'Abo as Paloma is the sexiest woman in the film).<br />Today Bo Derek appears on &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; and she does a nice job of acting while fully dressed (plus I think she is, oh, let's say, 10 times better looking today at 44 than she was at the age of 28). There is redemption in Hollywood and it is good to know that her time in Purgatory for &quot;Bolero&quot; is a thing of the past.p fantazigng about his wife (actually, Olivia d'Abo as Paloma is the sexiest woman in the film). <br />Today Bo Derek appears on &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; and she does a nice job of acting while fully dressed (plus I think she is, oh, let's say, 10 times better looking today at 44 than she was at the age of 28).

B00005K3OT|5.0|A perfect international cast comes together for this wonderful fable that will keep you enrapt for 2 hours.  Delightful performances, thoughtfull design and sensitive direction along with a charming score make this one to view more than once.<br />The Bonus features are less than thrilling and the Producer's commentary is hardly insightful or revealing.  It might have been more fun to have some of the cast members offer their recollections and observances than the producers who seemed to be more set on espousing facts from the press release.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Experimental Icelandic band Sigur R&oacute;s reached exceptional heights with &quot;Agaetis Byrjun,&quot; a fluidly mellow album. Music both cool and beautiful is warmed by Jon Por Birgisson's falsetto vocals and some majestic instrumentation -- and the result is staggeringly lovely.<br />The peak of the album is the slow, sparkling, sweeping &quot;Svefn-G-Englar.&quot; When listening to the eerie mixture of organ, strings and chimes, think about the northern lights over a glacier. But Sigur R&oacute;s has more than just soundscapes: the orchestral majesty of &quot;Staralfur,&quot; the ethereal music-box acoustics of &quot;Agaetis Byrjun,&quot; and the gentle piano and swelling strings of &quot;Vidrar vel til loftarasa.&quot;<br />It's hardly surprising that Sigur R&oacute;s is the biggest band in Ireland -- their music is ethereal, accessible, and so atmospheric that it's hard not to be swept away. There's a certain epic quality to their songs; what's more, they can can slowly switch from spine-tinglingly eerie to angelic ethereality.<br />It takes real effort to pick apart the seamless music at times. It almost feels wrong to do so. But the sweeping strings, organ and electric piano are standouts in &quot;Agaetis Byrjun.&quot; Most uniquely, there are music-scapes created without synths. Instead, there is an electric guitar played by a cello bow -- a unique bit of brilliance.<br />Icelandic singers are going to sing in Icelandic, right? Wrong. Frontman Jon Por Birgisson sings in a sort of made-up language the band calls &quot;Hopelandic.&quot; There's no discernable meaning, but Birgisson's high-pitched, melodious crooning banishes any real need for lyrics that mean something. His voice is just another instrument, like the piano or violin.<br />Imagine a cool, starry night with a cold breeze blowing through the trees -- that's Sigur R&oacute;s. Angelic and ethereal, &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot; is a rare musical experience without a single dud song.
B0000009XP|4.0|If you prefer happy, slickly-produced blues records, I suggest you pass on this one. If, however, you don't mind things a little loose and close-to-the-edge, I suggest you make the purchase immediately. I bought this record because it was described as the only Buddy Guy studio album that captured the passion and spontaneity of his live shows, and I think that's a fair assessment. This isn't a by-the-numbers groover: it's something darker and more explosive. Buddy really loses himself on these performances, but while going very near the deep end, Buddy is able to keep it remarkably coherent and deeply groovy. Occasionally, he solos with such explosive energy that he loses the tempo, and there are certainly plenty of stock phrases here, but it doesn't really reduce the enjoyment. It's certainly not his best collection of songs, but you won't hear many of these anywhere else, and I think it's indispensable.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At the end of the 19th century a young aspiring bohemian Brit, Christian (Ewan McGregor), moves into Montmartre, a Parisian district, to begin to write about love.  Despite Christian's awareness of his lack of experiences in love he sets out to try to conquer the world with his ambitions.  However, Christian's writings are momentarily stopped as he is interrupted by his neighbor's theatrical rehearsals, which leads him into an acting career.  Christian's new career leads him into the glamorous night club Moulin Rouge where all decadent behaviors have a haven.  It also opens up the doors to love and strong affection as Christian falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman).  This love affair is the beginning of a romantic tragedy as Christian and Satine have to fight for each other and their never-ending love.<br />Moulin Rouge is visually stunning and aurally delightful as it displays one of the most ancient themes of art and theater.  The colors and music that Luhrmann uses project a feeling of desire of our inner most secrets.  These feelings are openly expressed as they are displayed on the screen with a relaxed attitude, which enhances the audience's willingness to embrace the story.  The songs that are sung in Moulin Rouge are flirtatious as they express the ideas, feelings, and values of the film.  In the end, Luhrmann creates a marvelous cinematic experience, which will be remembered for a long time.
B000003TAR|5.0|Almost three weeks ago, it was ten years since the tragic death of Kurt Cobain. As a dedication, I'm here to write a review of \\"In Utero,\\" Nirvana's greatest single musical accomplishment in their short lived career as the world's biggest and best rock band on the planet. In those ten years since Cobain committed suicide, the music scene is forever changing and Kurt's music is still as powerful and widely-received as it was in the early 1990's. Nirvana blazed fiercely as the most revolutionary and influential rock act since the Beatles, and before they knew what hit them, the band was over forever on April 5th 1994. The world came to realise this three days later.<br />\\"Nevermind\\" has made Nirvana the most famous rock band in the world. It was their second album and sold a staggering 18 million copies worldwide. Kurt was tired of the adulation and praise that he received in truckloads, and decided to go back into the studio in 1993 and make an album that would scare off all the cling-ons. Originally titled \\"I Hate Myself And I Want To Die,\\" the album was released in September 1993 and was called In Utero. It topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, and shifted some 6 million copies in America. Critics adored it and I have to agree, this is one of the finest albums of all time.<br />\\"Serve The Servants\\" opens the album in grand style with a loud and abrasive beat with a wonderful melody. The song's most striking line is, \\"I tried hard to have a father, but instead I had a dad.\\" This deep-cutting line refers to Kurt's father who deserted him when he was a child. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" builds the album's aggression up even more, in one of the hardest rocking anthems the band ever recorded. This was one of the first times the band all shared writing kudos on a song instead of just Kurt. However, Kurt completely steals the song with his tortured yelp, \\"Go away!\\" throughout the chorus. The disturbing and manic verses refer to a book that Kurt read on a murdering perfume psycho.<br />The album's lead single, \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" is up next and easily towers as one of the greatest rock songs ever recorded. The production and vocals are on to top form here, complete with a visually stunning video (based on Kurt's dreams, apparently) and some genius lyrics such as, \\"Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back.\\" Perhaps the album's most controversial song, \\"Rape Me,\\" follows. This is easily one of the best songs on the album in which Kurt sings of rape as a metaphor for his emotional torture. The violence contained within the song makes it a song you simply cannot ignore.<br />\\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" is a fantastic song with a subdued intro that just rages out into a massive and loud assault on the ears. The lyrics, the arrangement, the vocals and the instruments are all superb - hell, even the title of the song is genius. \\"Dumb\\" is the first truly tranquil song on the album. There are no harsh vocals or lyrics here, everything is laid-back, but underneath lies disturbing images which can be seen through the lyrics, \\"My heart is broke, but I have some glue. Help me inhale, and mend it with you.\\" The addition of the cello also makes this one of the most beautiful songs you are ever likely to hear, even if it was three years old at the time of this album's release.<br />\\"Very Ape\\" is perhaps the worst song on the album, but it doesn't even last two minutes so it doesn't really matter. It's still a good composition, however, but serves as more of an interlude. \\"Milk It\\" is one of the best songs on the album and has some amazing lyrics. I love the way Kurt screams his chorus, \\"Doll steak! Test meat!\\" which is then followed by \\"Look on the bright side is suicide. Lost eyesight I'm on your side. Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing. Lack of iron and/or sleeping.\\" Here so much can be deciphered about Kurt's tumultuous state of mind at the time of writing and recording.<br />\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" isan extremely heartbreaking song, not so much for the lyrical content, but in the way Kurt almost cries his chorus with so much emotion and the instrumental halfway through. A fantastic song, and an utter classic. \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, despite what others may think. I love the way it starts off, so loud and shocking, before breaking out with a twisted and head-banging beat that only gets better as the song continues. Kurt's vocals are so full of hate towards himself and the way he keep questioning \\"What is wrong with me?\\" is just almost unlistenable.<br />\\"Tourette's\\" is the funniest track on the album. The title of the song is a condition which causes people to suddenly blurt out any noise or cuss-word that comes to mind, and suddenly we have Kurt just screaming and babbling a load of nonsense, but of course, in the best way possible. And then the album finally closes with \\"All Apologies.\\" One of Nirvana's finest ever songs, it represents a man so hard on himself it makes almost unbearable listening.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />So it's 10 years since the death of one of rock's biggest icons. Kurt Cobain became a legend upon his death, and why shouldn't he? He was a true genius who didn't realise his full potential before it was too late. Maybe we didn't realise his full potential. Who knows what he'd have gone on to do if he hadn't have been so stupid to commit suicide? Nevermind was awesome, this is ever better. Buy it now to realise just why. R.I.P.

B00005JMEW|5.0|The pregnant Bride aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) was brutalized and shot in the head by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad lead by Bill during her wedding ceremony.  Everyone in the wedding party was callously murdered with professional precision.  Four years later the Bride awakens from her nightmarish comatose sleep with a revengeful mind-set.  Disturbed and vengeful the Bride sets out to find the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in order to end their lives as she attempts to find closure to her tragic loss.<br />Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a well-written and spectacular cinematic event with a kaleidoscope of martial arts and other cinematic film nostalgia.  The cinematic nostalgia of spaghetti westerns, exploitation cinema, and martial art movies are deliberately inserted as homage by Tarantino.  These scenes are meticulously organized and cared for as Tarantino wants the audience to have a superb experience while viewing the film.  An example is the sampling of the music from the Gypsy Kings set to samurai sword fights in a Japanese garden, which works like magic.  The excellent cast performs extremely well under both physically strenuous scenes and daily dialogues.  An interesting side note to the casting of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Tarantino's use of the character Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), which is a distant relative several generations from the same character in a Japanese TV-series.  Throughout the film the cinematography is breathtaking as the camera flows and pans with the characters with effortless brilliance.  It is apparent when viewing Kill Bill: Vol. 1 that this film is made by a film lover who wants to share his love and interest for movies and smoothly enlighten the audience in the magical properties of cinema.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|Do you feel you are missing films thanks to your local Cineplex, which only features the most high-profile projects, and therefore excludes independent features? Or do you ever feel that by taking a weekend or so off from the movies that you missing some great films? And then you hear you friends chatting about them, it makes the already bad situation even worse? Many can lay claim to being in that very situation, missing out on noting-worthy independent and less commercial films that eventually found their way to be acknowledged by the Motion Picture Academy at the 76th Annual Academy Awards in February 2004, while others weren't quite so lucky. Such note-worthy features that failed to receive recognition include Bad Santa, Phone Booth and The Singing Detective. This isn't to say that nominated projects such as Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and Lost in Translation aren't worthy of acknowledgment, far from it. It is to say this one thing in Hollywood has yet to change: The bigger the studio, the bigger the trophy case will be.<br />The story is based on the tenth novel, \\"The Far Side of the World\\" in the \\"Master and Commander\\" series by Patrick O'Brian, who wrote twenty installments of the high-seas adventure series until his death in January 2000. The feature starts off in 1806 - Napoleon has proclaimed himself emperor of France after a failed attempt on his life and from there wages a military campaign which conquers Italy, Genoa, Vienna, and most of Austria and Germany. The Third Coalition, which consisted of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, has all but been decimated by severe defeats on land, thus leaving Britain and its advanced naval sea power as the only thing standing in the way of Napoleon and total victory over Europe. One of Britain's most impressive ships is the HMS Surprise, captained by the ambitious and commanding Jack Aubrey, who travels the world with his friend Stephen Maturin, who is also the ship's doctor. Along the Eastern coast of South America, Aubrey and his crew are ambushed by the French frigate, the Acheron. Though they escape in relatively one piece, the ship is deeply weakened and there is talk of turning back home to England. Faced with the fate of his crew and his country in his hand, Jack Aubrey must show true leadership by putting everything on the line and making quick decisions, no matter the cost. The story for Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the few films out there that embroils itself deeply in a certain time period of history but doesn't require its audience to have such extensive knowledge of events that it alienates certain demographics. Though the film doesn't demand background knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you go in with at least some idea of the events that the story surrounds itself with.<br />Though Master & Commander contains a rather large cast, few have actually made a name for themselves that they are easily recognizable by a majority of the movie-going audience but that doesn't matter so much in that only one person requires the audience's full attention, that being Russell Crowe. Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his performance in Gladiator and was nominated for A Beautiful Mind, was certainly worthy of at least a nomination with his commanding performance as Captain Jack Aubrey, in which he combines slight humor, enduring emotions, and dignified atmosphere that envelops the audience and keeps them focused with the actions on screen. Unfortunately, despite the film itself receiving ten nominations, the academy failed to recognize Crowe's amazing performance but that is easily forgettable as long as the audiences that watch this film get their money's worth of the film, thanks mostly to Crowe's engaging Jack Aubrey. And it's not just Crowe but the character's actions within the film itself ... the fact that he darts across the deck of the ship in an attempt tobe almost everywhere at once, his ability to be charming and eloquent while playing his violin while being forceful and compelling in battle, and sticking to his guns despite certain opposition and small consequences that occur because of that decision.<br />Overall, Leadership, patriotism, and a true sense of responsibility and duty, all of which are desperately needed amongst a certain portion of the American people today, take center stage even away from Crowe's most commanding role to date. The most astonishing thing Peter Weir and his follow filmmakers have been able to do, besides elegantly and tastefully poking fun at the French, is to create a story that is slow and lumbering at times but not so much so that it results in a boring and lusterless feature, in fact Master & Commander is quite the opposite. It successfully keeps the audience members at the edge of their seats not only for the action occurring on screen but by keeping them in utter anticipation of events yet to unfold in the film as well. A beautifully mastered musical score, created by Christopher Gordon, Iva Davies and Richard Tognetti, keeps the historical time period in the context of the occurring actions in slower portions of the film while still engaging the audience with a rousing complement to the battle sequences. But the film's most powerful quality is its message of enduring leadership and dedication to one's country despite nearly impossible odds and the cost of friendship and life appearing to be worth more then the end result. The United States faces that exact challenge today but as the Jack Aubrey discovers, there is no more important value in life then a devotion to one's country and the commanding leadership that drives not only the crew but the heart and soul of one's country as well.
B0000041XX|5.0|For most opera &quot;snobs&quot; the three tenors have committed the ultimate sin: singing &quot;popular songs&quot; outside the opera house. <br />For the rest of opera lovers, this CD is a miracle. It's not a coincidence that it has been sold over 15 million copies. This CD is, to my taste, the best of all the Three tenors performances. The arias are chosen from the most loved opera repertoire. As for the following &quot;pot pourri&quot; it is just gorgeous. I'm a &quot;Three Tenors disciple&quot; as it is after hearing this CD that my passion for opera started, as I guess for many other people. Now that I am much more into &quot;real opera&quot; I cannot but find this CD compilation exquisite. Hearing three great tenors fly into the high notes all at one gives goose bumps. <br />As for the other &quot;opera fanatics&quot;, those whose ears are so sensible that they'll have an allergy if someone other than Caruso, Gigli, Corelli or Bjorling is singing, I guess they still have much to learn. They have to learn to appreciate what GREAT &quot;contemporary&quot; (not so much any more, but say for the last quarter of the 20th) opera tenors have to offer. <br />This is A MUST, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CD.
B000001GQD|5.0|of the Rachmaninov with the Prokofiev Concerto 5. That is a more worthwhile purchase. The Prokofiev 5 is a legend compared with this Tchailkovsky. I don't know what made those DG people switch the coupling.
0920668372|5.0|The first time I read this book which I just came across accidentally in the book store, I thought it was beautiful and I cried but I didn't buy it because some of the illustrations in that version struck me as creepy, and I couldn't afford it.   I felt a bit bad about not buying it because I loved it.  Then I saw it again with pictures by another illustrator and I was so glad I hadn't bought the first copy. These pictures were so cute and off set the intensity and the sad bit of the story, (which by the way my son doesn't notice)  The version shown here seems to be of an edition with pictures by yet another illustrator.  My edition is actually called \\"I'll love you forever\\" which I bought in New Zealand. In this version the boy has a dog in it that grows up with him and EVERYTHING such as the tree in his backyard and the decor in his room grows and changes with him and it's all so cute.  There is no ladder tied to the car, the mother lets herself in with a key her son gave her and rocks him back and forth. This is fantasy and for a 4-year-old it is comforting to think that Mummy will still rock him and sing to him when he is a big man and the older child will just find it humorous.   My 4-year-old son loves this book He mostly wants to hear stories about Thomas the Tank Engine, but he is just as keen to hear this book. I did worry about the hint that the boy's mother is dying but my son doesn't get that bit. That's written for the mother. He just thinks the mother is sick that day.  It was the most beautiful book I could find for my son, and as a woman with a Master Degree in English Lit, I take pleasure in the way the rhythm of the book flows off the tongue. In fairness to the critics, it is a book to be read by mothers who are intense people. Mothers who are overwhelmed with the love they feel for the child. There are some people in the world who are just too cowardly and shallow to understand that kind of intensity. That is both their good fortune and their loss.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This one makes my top 5 worst movies of all time list.  I frankly fail to see what anyone would find entertaining or funny about this movie.  Although I usually like Bill Murray's films, this one is a big loser.  Even worse is the direction.  This is a perfect example of Hollywood getting behind &quot;one of the family&quot; and hyping a movie that should have never been made.

B00006GFAB|4.0|Kiss is the band that perfected the art of breaking their guitars at the end of their concerts. Oh, and they also painted their faces and their bassist has a monstrously long tongue which he's always liked to flick out at his audience, which immediately gets them hot and excited I guess (lol). The band also likes to show off their hairy chests because that was considered sexy back in the '70s. Kiss created THE anthem of R&R, \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\"! Great tune. This compilation has their best songs. I'm not a diehard fan, I don't like all their songs, only their very best ones. This has it.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"
B000066NW0|2.0|I am not going to get up in arms about Ms. Lavigne's &quot;rocker&quot; or &quot;punk&quot; credentials.  Personally, I think she's as manufactured as Brittany, Christina, and the other pop princesses, but I see no reason to hate her for it.  She'll be gone from the spotlight soon enough so why begrudge her the time in the spotlight.<br />You see Ms. Lavigne is more about marketing towards a niche.  She was geared specifically towards a certain marketing demographic- adolescent girls who wanted an alternative to Brittany/Christina.  The marketing ploy worked and this album skyrocketed.  However, there is no more fickle fan in the world than a 12 yr old girl!  The pop music scene is littered with the short lived careers of musicians who were fervently embraced by adolescent girls and then just as quickly discarded when something newer and &quot;cooler&quot; came along.  Take a look at the careers of David Cassidy, Donnie Osmond, the Bay City Rollers, Leif Garrett, Debbie and Tiffany, the New Kids, and others for a preview of where Avril's career is heading.  I have no doubt in a few years (or maybe even right now) most of Avril's fans will be embarrassed that they listened to her.  Quite simply, Ms. Lavigne's fan base will grow up and move on.  It happens almost everytime an artist relies on little girls to sell his or her CDs.
B000050HTO|5.0|I'm very pleased with this album because I much prefer Dylan's early folksy songs to the later blues stuff, and this album has much of the older stuff of his that I love. Songs like Blowin' In The Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' etc etc--songs like that are Dylan to me. Bob Dylan was this gloomy guy who looked like a classical composer with the big messy hair, who then wrote some of the classics of modern folk rock. A real legend. His lyrics are very good too.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00003CXCT|3.0|This is the Star Wars Special Editions on DVD.  Unlike typical Director's Cuts, the Special Editions include many altered original scenes rather than merely additional footage.  In other words, these are not the original A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, although this is intentionally non-obvious from the packaging and marketing.<br />The original three Star Wars films are great.  This marketing campaign is not.  It is worth noting that aside from a few rare laserdiscs, Lucas has intentionally refused to release the original films in any permanent form.  His attempts to pass off this DVD set as the original is vile enough, but also merely assures in a few years that he will likely release an 'original' Star Wars DVD set for another round of gouging.  Be advised.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album has many of my favorite Beatles tunes, like She Loves You, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, and the list goes on. The Beatles just wrote and played the best songs, period. Back in those days there were many one or two hit wonders, but then there were the giants, like The Stones, the Doors, and especially the Beatles, and such heavyweight music giants gave us many great songs to sink our teeth (or ears) into. I wasnt around back then, but I wish I had been, to experience this amazing musical revolution. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B000002KFJ|5.0|(...Continued)<br />A brilliant intro that crunches w/ fast, heavy rhythm guitar, layered on top with a brilliant lead guitar solo, distinguishes the nearly-six-minute &quot;Thrill Of It All,&quot; before it briefly stops &amp; gives way to a rather funky groove with Ozzy doing some of his best roots-rock singing. The lyrics seem to be a bit cynical on paper, but in the context of the song can be seen as a plea for God's help. I love this particular set of lyrics:<br />&quot;Won't ya help me Mr. Jesus?<BR>Won't ya tell me if you can?<BR>When ya see this world we live in<BR>Do ya still believe in man?<BR>If my psalms become my freedom<BR>And my freedom turns to gold<BR>Then I'll ask the final question<BR>If the answer could be sold.&quot;<br />The song builds to a frenzied but very melodic crescendo before fading out. The next song (sixth on the album, for those attempting to keep track) is the ironically-titled &quot;Supertzar&quot; which begins slowly with synthesized gothic chanting, then blends in Tony Iommi's deep riffing, plus strings! That's all it is---no Ozzy singing here; it's very unique in the Black Sabbath canon, and very listenable. After that, the strangely psychedelic-sounding &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot; follows. It's kind of a nauseating track that contains lots of synthesizers and features Ozzy singing harmony with himself in a monotonous voice. It's not a bad song; it's just that it's a mystery as to why Black Sabbath chose this as the only single from SABOTAGE, and not a superior song like &quot;Hole In The Sky.&quot; Understandably, &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot; ended up barely cracking the charts. It ends with a bunch of maniacal screaming that runs right into the final track, the nearly-9-minute epic &quot;The Writ.&quot; Probably the best song on the entire album (it's an extremely close call between it, &quot;Hole In The Sky&quot; &amp; &quot;Megalomania&quot;), it begins with some very deep, creepy synthesized sounds for over half a minute and then just totally explodes with Ozzy singing:<br />&quot;The way I feel is the way I act<BR>I wished I'd walked before I started to run to you,<BR>Just to you.<br />What kind of people do you think we are?<BR>Another joker who's a rock 'n' roll star for you,<BR>Just for you.<br />The fateful image of another man,<BR>The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you,<BR>Yeah, for you.<br />Your fun trip was layin' down on the floor<BR>I wish they'd fallen into my private world with you,<BR>Yeah with you.<br />Are you metal? Are you man?<BR>You've changed a lot since you began,<BR>Yeah, began.<br />Ladies digging gold from you<BR>Will they still dig dying true,<BR>Yeah, true.&quot;<br />As you can tell, &quot;The Writ&quot; is an extremely cynical track that gets to the point, and rather quickly. I love how confident Ozzy sounds as he breaks through the cr*p in this world with his insightful and no-nonsense lyrics. (Back then, he was an especially brilliant songwriter.) At about the 3 1/2-minute mark, &quot;The Writ&quot; (in true Ozzy-era Black Sabbath fashion) suddenly changes and slows up, injecting some harpsichord into the mix. Sounding alternatively somber and optimistic, it's up to anyone's opinion as to what Ozzy really means when he sings &quot;But everything is gonna work out fine, yeah/If it don't I'll feel I'll blow my mind, yeah.&quot; The song gets heavier again with another very muscular rhythm guitar riff by Tony Iommi, which continues till the song eventually fades out. <br />Thus endeth SABOTAGE, one of Black Sabbath's greatest albums ever, and their last great one of the Ozzy era. After this, it was all downhill from here, as Ozzy became too embroiled in drug addiction, alcoholism and other excesses. The other band members grew impatient with his increasing self-absorption and destruction, and released their first &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation while waiting to get back into the studio to record what turned out to be an extremely messy and inferior record. But we'll get to that in my next review. For now, let's just enjoy the brilliant symphony of noise that is SABOTAGE.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B0000TLA9G|5.0|For a band that put out surprisingly few albums, they wrote more than a fair share of very good songs. I remember hearing and enjoying them as a kid. Guns N Roses' more ballady songs especially are excellent examples of that style of song. This compilation is no disappointment, it has practically all of the best hits. It's a pity that such a talented band with such brilliant songwriters as Axl Rose and Slash suddenly stopped playing and making music. Let's hope there will be another chapter to the life of this band.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000CABK8|1.0|Why is it so hard for Paramount to release a box set containing only all of the Special Editions they have ready so far?  Every Star Trek box set is like this -- several movies with Special Editions and several more movies that you'll end up having to repurchase seperately because they are not the Special Editions.<br />If you're looking to buy something for the Trekkie in your life, I strongly suggest looking up the Special Editions individually and buying them like that and avoid buying the movies that are not out in Special Edition yet -- save those for future gifts when they get released.  Whatever extra you end up spending by doing it like this will ultimately be saved by not having to buy the regular edition now and then the Special Edition later.<br />Perhaps the casual Trek fan will enjoy this box set but even for the casual viewer, I don't see why you'd want the regular edition of some of these movies now when you can wait a few months and get a much better edition later.
B00000K2W1|4.0|My two favorite Joplin songs are Piece of my Heart and Summertime (no surprise!). She was a blues rock genius who wooed audiences with a voice so black, it's a wonder that her skin was so white. But, as with many rock gods (or in this case, goddess), the bottle was her best friend. She died at age 27. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B000002JPA|3.0|A couple years ago, I started hearing a lot about this band through word of mouth.  I was really into prog-rock and metal when I was younger so I bought Images and Words out of curiosity.  The first time I listened to it, I was incredibly disappointed.  Songs and vocals sounded cheesy.  Instruments were wanky.  The thrash metal riffs sounded dated.  Over the years, I've listened to the album many times (mostly because I was trying to learn how to play the songs) and while I've grown more accustomed to their sound, I still don't particularly care for this album (or any of DT's other albums).  There aren't any songs that I really hate.  All of them are okay.  I can almost enjoy Pull Me Under.  Under a Glass Moon has an exciting, inventive guitar solo.  If you're into this sort of thing, you'll probably love this album like all of the other reviewers.  If you're not, Images and Words probably won't change your mind.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is my favorite or second favorite Beatles album. They were the best group in history, and remain so to this day, and then Yoko Ono broke them up I guess. And when they weren't writing their fab tunes in the studio, they were screwing with strange girls (or at least giving them autographs), getting philosophical with gurus, and downright psychedelic with mind-altering drugs. They became so popular that a strange medical condition known as beatlemania is attributed to them. Among its symptoms were: hysteria, fainting, and obsessive tendencies. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00006IRJU|5.0|Early morning, sun rising on Sidney seen through the shades of a window in a radio station transmition booth. A DJ talks to his listeners and takes a request from a female voice on the phone: \\"Can you play 'Crazy' for me?\\" This is how the video of Icehouse's \\"Crazy\\" started, back in 1987, the year Australian band put out this (in my opinion, their best) album: 'Man of Colours', and the DJ was no one else but lead singer Iva Davies.<br />The entire album is a solid collection of late eighties material from the band that is firmly entrenched in the same vein as other bands of their time, such as INXS, Midnight Oil and, to a certain extent, even U2. Though \\"Crazy\\" will always live in my mind as a song that I will always remember 1987 for, the rest of the album is packed with great works, such as \\"Electric Blue\\", the title track and \\"Kingdom\\". To complement it, this remastered edition comes packed with extra tracks of remixes of the other songs. In particular, the midnight mix of \\"Crazy\\" is the 'background' music that was playing in the beginning of the song's video, before the actual song kicked in, and it's one hell of a song to begin the day!<br />Overall: go, don't walk -run to get a copy of this album!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I gave this album to my sister for Xmas, as she's a big Sarah McLachlan fan. I also had a listen to it. I think the other album is better, but this is still a good effort that won't disappoint most fans. Also recommended: Fiona Apple or Tori Amos. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
6305373248|5.0|Demi Moore was excellent in this film. She is not only a beautiful woman, not just body wise, but within her soul.<br />Demi plays a divorced woman, Erin Grant, who looses custody of her beloved daughter to a scumbag of an ex husband. (This is typical justice in the real world. I relate to this movie because it happened to me and I haven't seen my daughter for 13 years.)<br />Anyway, she had a respectful job at the FBI and looses it because of her husband's criminal activities. Then she looses her daughter because she doesn't have a job.<br />So she becomes an exotic dancer to make the money needed to get her daughter back. It's excellent money for her but she doesn't really like what she's doing. However, she performs with class and dignity, regardless of the stigmitism of &quot;strippers.&quot; Ving Rhames, who is the bouncer Shad, has a soft spot in his heart for Erin. Anyone calling her a &quot;stripper&quot; will find a drill gun spinning at their forehead. She is a &quot;dancer.&quot;<br />Burt Reynolds plays the corrupt, twisted Congressman who finds his &quot;angel&quot; (Erin) and persues her. There is legal snaffu's, funny scenes, and Erin is witty and courages because she will not give up on her daughter. Her love for her daughter is deep and real.<br />Demi learned to dance like an exotic dancer for this film and after just having a baby at the time, she looks great.<br />This film you will either like it or not. If you're looking for a lot of skin, T&amp;A, this is not what you want. This film does have class. Demi's brief nudity in the film just proves that she is a confident woman and a great actress.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|every track in this album (cept the first :P) is worthy of being a single :)
0792844882|1.0|Even Elizabeth Berkley's nudity couldn't save this movie.<br />It was tasteless and just bad. Period!
B00000IN5G|5.0|No way on earth anyone can ever get tired of this CD.  This album has it all - every song is perfect!  The opener starts off like I've never heard, \\"Silent Night, Bodom Night\\" is classic, tracks 3 and 5 have sounds that I've never heard anywhere else AND compliment the music perfectly, and Downfall... my favorite Children of Bodom song.  Who would have imagined such strong keyboards can actually fit into a song and work?!  I didn't.  I actually watched the video clip for this song before hearing it.  That's what made me buy the album, actually.  I already had Follow the Reaper and Hate Crew Deathroll (with the bonus track that's the Slayer cover) when I bought this, and boy - why did I wait?!  <br />I don't know what to say about this album.  Its just flat out perfect.  No second of this album went to waste when this was written.  If you're the mother of a 10 year old, don't let him/her buy this.  The lyrics are pretty harsh.  Other than that, Alexi's voice is very, very strong, Janne's keyboards are beyond incredible, and the other members do their job to perfection.  <br />Also, I think this is Children of Bodom's most solid effort yet.  I don't mean that the result was great - I mean that this is written perfectly, as I said before.  This was recorded at the famous Finnvox Studios, if you didn't already know.  <br />To be honest, I don't know why any metal fan doesn't already have this album, unless you're just getting into the genre.  If you like ANY music with harsh vocals, this album will be more than satisfying.  Go get it - now.  <br />When you get the time, go read some of my other reviews and say if they were helpful or not.  Thanks for reading.
B00004TH6O|5.0|When I first heard QOTSA, I was like \\"This is is f***in' incredible!!\\"  The song was \\"The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret\\", and the riff, beat, and vocals just blew me away.  Later on, one of my good buddies played me the entire album \\"Rated R\\" and I went out and got it the next day.  Simply said, this is hands down the best album to come out of 2000.  This is a true rock album from a true rock band, who really don't give a F*** about mainstream music or fame.  <BR>The second CD in the band's catalogue, \\"Rated R\\" features a revolving cast of musicians centered around lead singer/guitarist Josh Homme, and bassist Nick Oliveri, both of whom are founding members of the legendary band, Kyuss.  It should also be noted that when these guys made the first Kyuss album, they were both 17 years old.  Upon the release of \\"Blues For The Red Sun\\", considered by many to be Kyuss's finest work, they were just 18.  True prodigies.<br />1. \\"Feel Good Hit Of The Summer\\" 10/10.  The first single.  Keeping true to QOTSA fashion, \\"Rated R\\" kicks off with one of the heavier tracks on the album, one which, because of the near constant drug references, was sensored just about everywhere.  Oh yeah, if you want to check out the video, it's on their website, QOTSA.com.  Pretty cool.<BR>2.  \\"The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret\\" 10/10.  Another single.  Totally catchy, totally cool.  I never get sick of this song.  Totally refreshing in a music scene full nu-metal and pop.<BR>3.  \\"Leg Of Lamb\\" 9/10.  Cool lyrics, cool guitars, and very cool vocals.  Joshe Homme sings like he's just sitting back chilling in a couch somewhere, but with oh so much style.  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that it can get repetitive after a time.<BR>4.  \\"AutoPilot\\" 10/10.  I've heard some people slag this song, and I really can't figure out why, as it's sooo trippy and cool.  Featuring Nick Oliveri on vocals and guitar, and Josh Homme on drums, this is one of the best songs, if not the best song on the album.  Just awesome.<BR>5.  \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" 10/10.  Another trancy song which is probably the most jamlike and unstructured song on the CD. Cool vocal effects, very cool bassline, and an unbelievable middle section, where Joshe Homme just takes it away on his guitar, soloing his ass off, while being backed by cool chants and awesome drumming by Nick Lucero.<BR>6.  \\"Monsters In The Parasol\\" 7/10.  About a first-time LSD experience.  My least favorite track on the album, as I can't stand that chorus.  Cool verse though, and just as cool vocals.<BR>7.  \\"Quick And The Pointless\\" 9/10.  Josh Homme: \\"It's about being obsessed with young girls. Sort of like 'Lolita' except more foaming at the mouth.\\"  The first song to feature Nick Oliveri doing his trademark screams.  Short, hard, and furious.<BR>8.  \\"In The Fade\\" 10/10.  The best song on the CD, without a doubt.  Anybody who listens to this should come away with a total respect for Mark Lanegan, as his vocals on this song are soooo good, especially with lyrics as good as these.  Great bass , and excellent guitars make this song the most dynamic and original track on the CD.  Should have been a single.<BR>9.  \\"Tension Head\\" 10/10.  This song represents one thing: balls.  One of the heaviest F***ing things I've ever heard, and it's pretty much from Nick Oliveri's attitude alone.  You can listen to Slayer, Korn and every other metal band, but just listening to Oliveri shred his throat out, screaming and moaning about smoking crack, makes you want to go out and do something horrible.  I've played this for kids who strictly listen to cannibal corpse and meshuggah, and they've just been like \\"WTF!!\\"  A different kind of heaviness.<BR>10.  \\"The Lightning Song\\" 10/10.  A really nice, and quite frankly, beautiful instrumental cool-down after \\"Tension Head\\".  Featuring just bongos, a 12 string guitar, and a piano, this is a genuine work of art.<BR>11.  \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" 9.5/10.  Grooved-out, laid back stoner rock, pure and simple.  Slow and heavy with Joshe Homme just doing some amazing singing.  One of the best, heaviest, and trippiest songs on here.  I didn't give it a ten, because after the song \\"ends\\", the intrumental fadeout goes on for about four minutes and gets quite annoying.<br />Notably fueled by drugs, sex, and outright craziness, \\"Rated R\\" is definitely a must own album for any real fan of rock and roll.  Totally original, meaningful and at times, psychotic, this album has something for everyone on it.  By my own opinion, this CD is probably the most melodic album in the QOTSA catalogue, though it stills rocks hard.  Cheers to a true band who's each release is notably different, yet truly their own style.
B000069HKH|3.0|Reviewer J. Hrubes of New Hampshire made the remark: \\"I hope Bruce enjoys his wealthy lifestyle with the BLOOD MONEY he made from this album. He is so concerned about sharing the wealth, why doesn't he give some of his millions to his cause.\\"    Mr. Hrubes, I suggest you do a bit more research. Bruce HAS given millions to charity, for many, many years. Most of his efforts don't get much press outside of Jersey (like all those Christmas charity concerts he's done outside his home, or the quiet but enormous donations he's given to charities in N.J. that few know about), but occasionally, he will do something high profile, like kicking off the multimillion TV telethon that aired a few weeks after 9/11/01. Yes, he lives well, but how many other multimillionaires have given or raised as much money as he has for so many years?    As for the album itself, it's not my favorite Springsteen album as the songwriting isn't as sharp as his best work, and it feels like he should've cut out the weaker tracks to make a tighter album (70+ minutes, essentially a double-Lp if vinyl was still the format of choice), but the production and arrangements are excellent, and there are still some very strong cuts: the title track which thankfully isn't overplayed anymore on the radio, \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"You're Missing,\\" the edgy, disturbing portrait of a deranged terrorist in \\"Paradise,\\" the Van Morrison-like \\"Meet Me At Mary's Place,\\" the moody, synth-laden \\"Nothing Man,\\" and \\"My City of Ruin\\" (which was given a stunning performance and a bare, acoustic arrangement for that same telethon I mentioned). Not a home-run, not a masterpiece, but still not bad. It's at least worth getting as a cheap, used copy.
B000002OOY|5.0|Hello all you Amazon.com folks, it is I -- Preston Jelmet! I have come here today to talk about the FANTASTIC score to the FANTASTIC film, Jurassic Park... composed by... yours truly, Preston Jelmet! <br />Now you may be thinking, Preston, John Williams wrote the score to Jurassic Park. NO! It was I. John Williams was busy feeding his chewy chocolate chip cookie addiction and between bites said, &quot;Preston, you MUST compose this score, I just can't focus.&quot; So of course, I was happy to step up to the plate. <br />First off, my score is pure genius. It's the best thing ever written, and I wrote it. First off, I want to talk about the instrumentation. I use a lot of strings, because strings are cool and they sound cool. Little known fact: lots of composers throughout history have used strings other than me, but I'm really the one to pioneer that Hollywood &quot;string&quot; sound, starting with Jurassic Park. Until then, strings were BORING. <br />Let's talk about my fantastic main theme a little. Okay not a little, a lottle. My main theme is great. I use brass a lot in it. It's a fanfare, because when I think dinosaurs, I think fanfare, I think of 76 Trombones, don't you? When I think of dinosaurs, I think about everything but what I should be thinking of... originally I was going to have a caveman percussion ensemble playing the instruments &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;fire&quot; but John Williams (my good friend) thought that wouldn't be a good idea. <br />So I did fanfare. <br />Let's talk about my awesome track where Nedry runs away with the embryos. I thought I would use weird percussion because Dennis Nedry was weird too. It also has a very specific tempo, because it was the only choice to represent Dennis Nedry's overweight facade. Overweight, indeed... <br />Finally, the most brilliant thing is the FLUTE STACCATO in the score at some points. Whenever I would write it and show it to my good friend John Williams, he would say &quot;Preston, the flute staccato is absolutely BRILLIANT... but I don't know if the world is ready for all this incredible flute staccato.&quot; And I suppose the world isn't. <br />The world just can't handle flute staccato.
B00005JLH2|4.0|Nothing like a percussion section to dress up a marching band--to give the band some flair and a nice touch of razzle-dazzle.  Is it any wonder percussion sections are often comprised of flamboyant, overly-confident, enthusiastic showboaters?  And there's nothing wrong with that:  after all, these guys have to strut their stuff, entertain the crowd, and hold the band together--all at the same time.<br />The movie DRUMLINE pays homage to the determined percussionists who entertain college football crowds on Saturday afternoons.  The story itself is formulaic and predictable:  young Devon (Nick Cannon), a snare drummer with buckets of talent but a serious attitude, is constantly on the outs with his no-nonsense band director, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones, forever known to me as the 7UP dude).  But the story is enhanced by the fascinating trials and tribulations of the (fictitious) Atlanta A&amp;T marching band as it progresses through a long football season.  The viewer is privy to the band's countless practices, personality clashes, section challenges, and performances.  But the performances make this movie so entertaining; director Charles Stone III and his crew really knew their stuff, as DRUMLINE vividly portrays the gritty and glittery realism of a big-time college marching band.<br />I even get a nice little workout while I watch this film--especially when Atlanta A&amp;T's percussion section must meet a challenging drumline in a &quot;face-off&quot; to determine the winner of a national marching band contest.  The drum cadences, the pounding and clashing rhythms, are so clean, crisp, and compelling that I find myself first bobbing my head to the beat, then swaying and strutting to the delightful sounds.  Finally, I'm slapping my beer belly in unison with the cadence (and I keep up pretty well, if I do say so myself).  The workout provides a fresh burst of energy, and so does DRUMLINE.<br />--D. Mikels
B000002UA5|3.0|1969's &quot;Ummagumma&quot; is a very good--but very curious--Pink Floyd album. The first half is live material recorded in 1969 in Birmingham and at Manchester College, while the second half is studio material---*solo* material from each of the four Floyds (apparently it was keyboardist Richard Wright who came up with the idea of solo material from each band member). The album's mish-mash presentation of live stuff with Floyd solo stuff is not completely successful, but at the same time, &quot;Ummagumma&quot; is certainly not without it's merits. First, the live stuff: fantastic. Just four songs, but they're all classic early Floyd---&quot;Astronomy Domine,&quot; &quot;Careful With That Axe Eugene,&quot; &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,&quot; and &quot;A Saucerful Of Secrets,&quot; each one rendered by the band with ferocious power (and &quot;Careful With That Axe,&quot; especially, sounds even better live than in it's original studio version). To date, these live recordings, along with the live &quot;Wall&quot; set, &quot;Is There Anybody Out There,&quot; released in 2000, remain the only vintage live Floyd material with Roger Waters that's available to the masses. Hopefully, the band will release more live recordings from their vaults in the years to come. Surely they must exist!As for the solo studio stuff, it's a real mixed bag. Only bassist Roger Waters really leaves an impression on the listener with his pair of tracks, the fine acoustic number &quot;Grantchester Meadows,&quot; and the bizarre sound collage with the equally bizarre name, &quot;Several Species Of Small Furry Animals....&quot;, which concludes with Waters doing an off-kilter Scottish rant. I don't know what the heck it all means, but it sure is an entertaining track, I'll give it that. Richard Wright's four-part keyboard piece, &quot;Sysyphus,&quot; is interesting in parts, but some of it just sounds like aimless noodling. Guitarist David Gilmour's solo spotlight, &quot;The Narrow Way,&quot; is no better, having some good sections along with some rather forgettable ones (even Gilmour himself says he just &quot;faked&quot; his way through the piece, as he wasn't a skilled songwriter just yet). And Nick Mason's experiment with electronically enhanced drums, &quot;The Grand Vizier's Garden Party,&quot; is listenable, but not exactly memorable.If I had to name my least favorite Pink Floyd album, it's &quot;Ummagumma,&quot; if only because it's the Floyd album I play the least. The live stuff IS outstanding but leaves you hungry for more, and only Roger Waters comes out on top with the band's various solo outings on the second half. But both the live material and Waters' pair of good tracks make &quot;Ummagumma&quot; hang together. It's definitely a Pink Floyd album worth owning. Just don't expect to play it too often!row Way,&quot; is no better, having some good sections along with some rather forgettable ones (even Gilmour himself says he just &quot;faked&quot; his way through the piece, as he wasn't a skilled songwriter just yet).

0618526412|5.0|Deeply moving story, unsettling and yet heroic as well.  Recommended for anyone who loves a great book that will stay with you for years.
0375422307|5.0|Definitely one of the most unique and interesting books i've ever read. There are a lot of ways to tell a story, and this was actually one of the most touching perspectives on the iranian revolution I've ever read. <br />As an iranian american, I always hear stories from my parents/relatives/acquaintances on what happened - events leading up to the revolution - and life in iran afterwards - but how often do you hear the story from that 12 yr old's voice? There were a lot of funny episodes that made me laugh out loud...and a lot of parts where you feel genuine empathy for her. There were some very sweet moments with marjane's uncle or grandmother where you actually feel that connection and can relate it to yourself. <br />Marjane shows the effects of the revolution on her family and day to day life...seeing friends drafted or imprisoned - and witnessing many fleeing to America. It's a story that we've all seen and heard (and is not unique to Iranians) yet it's refreshing and bittersweet at the same time. She keeps the story alive and light with her mishaps at school, with friends, and with her childhood adventures. <br />I loved this book. It's a quick read, but that comic-book format of it will actually make the story and images really stay in your mind.
B000002LCK|5.0|New Order is definitely my favourite band. Substance is their best album as it brings all their early 80's work together, which in my opinion is New Order sounding their best. The best thing about New Order and this album is that it does not sound like any other band, they had a distinct sound that nobody else could even come close to replicating. <BR>&quot;Ceremony&quot; is an excellent song. I particularly like 'Everything's Gone Green' for its drum machine beat and the guitar chords. 'Temptation' would have to be my fav song as its very melodic and hypnotic. I do prefer 'Temptation' being played live as it sounds much more like an anthem and more joyous. 'Perfect Kiss' would have to be one of the best electronic songs ever. 'Blue Monday' of course, one of the best dance songs. Bernards cold, deep vocals help make this song stand out from the rest.<BR>The second cd which are the b-sides are also very good. I must admit it took me awhile to 'get' the songs but once you do they are fantastic. My favs from the second cd are Procession, Mesh, Hurt, The Beach, Lonesome Tonight and 1963.<BR>If you like alternative music and not into the mainstream, then this album is certainly worth buying. Believe me you will be hooked!
B00005JN1L|3.0|I'll bet you that 90% of the people who saw Stephen King's \\"Secret Window\\" went for Johnny Depp.  Fresh off his \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" success, and now a mainstream movie star (and People magazines \\"Sexiest Man Alive\\"!), Johnny is fantastic.  In fact, he is the only reason to see this movie.  This is by no means a bad film, but there's just nothing here that is in the least bit fresh or innovative.  Basically, \\"Secret Window\\" fails to have that \\"special something\\" that distinguishes it from the endless line of psychological thrillers Hollywood churns out.  In addition, most movie fans will be able to see the alleged \\"twist ending\\" coming from a mile away.  If you're looking for a real twist ending or a truly suspenseful thriller, try any of M. Night Shyamalan's three films, if you haven't already.  In the end, \\"Secret Window\\" was entertaining enough for me and, along with the help of Johnny's steady stream of dry cracks and humorous facial expressions, should keep most audiences interested.<br />Johnny Depp is a true movie star.  He has such a presence onscreen, such an indescribable charm.  You can't help but sit in rapt attention as Johnny putters around his house for an hour with a perennial case of bed head.  His magnetic presence is reminiscent of that of Cary Grant's.  Though the men are obviously polar opposites, they both are hypnotizing onscreen. Johnny fans rejoice, he is onscreen in practically every frame :-)
B0000TLA9G|1.0|First of all its just songs that you can get on thier other albums like Appetite for Destruction. I dont know about any one else but on the cd i got some songs wont even play and one of them is edited... whiched pissed me off. I would give it zero stars, but I can't because the website won't let me. If you want to take my advice, I suggest you DO NOT buy this album, and if someone buys if for you... use it for target practice.
B000002KB8|5.0|Some may say that bands like Led Zepplin started heavy metal, but I disagree...I feel Black Sabbath was the first true metal band and this was the first true metal record.  Over 35 years later, this album is still astonishing; time period isn't even a factor at all.  Whenever I tell people that this CD was recorded in 1969, their feeling is of disbelief; Black Sabbath doesn't reflect what was happening in the time period one bit.  No matter what metal of today that you like, the influence of Black Sabbath's early years is always heard.  Black Sabbath's debut truly captures a feeling that was unheard of at the time.  Each song is just so powerful and raw.  Though many many years later, Tony Iommi went on to form his own versions of Black Sabbath while Ozzy went solo; nothing these members do will ever compare to Sabbath in its classic lineup.  Sure, the members went on to make great music, but its got nothing on the first few Sabbath albums.  These guys truly started dark music.  I got to see the mighty Sabbath in classic form back at Ozzfest a handful of years ago and you best believe that while on stage many of the bands took their time during their sets top pay homage to the mighty Sabbath.  Though I feel the band's sound wasn't truly perfected until &quot;Paranoid&quot;, this is quite possibly the greatest debut of all time.  If you're a metal fan and don't have this in your collection, that's a crime.  I plan on selling my copies of the Sabbath disks with Ozzy though so that I can buy the &quot;Black Box&quot; set of all of these disks which should be incredible!  I suggest anyone interested go check that out.  All I can say is that these are the pioneers baby!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't discover Joss Whedon's TV work until last fall.  I had seen the Buffy the Vampire Salyer movie a long time ago when it first came out, and while amusing, I didn't think it was very good at all.  I started seeing Buffy every now and then on the f/x channel, and I became hooked.  I have since seen all of the Buffy and Angel shows, and needing a fix, decided to throw $40 at the Firefly DVD set on the off-chance it might be good.<br />Wow! What an amazing show.  I watched the whole series and special features in two evenings (I would've watched it in one, but I had to go to work the next day).  All I can say is that if you are looking for an entertaining and moving story with compelling characters, interesting stories, and Joss Whedon's trademark experimental perspectives, then you should buy this DVD set.  You won't regret it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never saw it on TV.  Bought the DVD's and it is the best series I have ever seen.  It was recommended by a co-worker and at first I thought, ugh, space western!  But I saw it here on Amazon, bought it, and am now a confirmed Brown-Coat!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|apparently i have missed the boat on this one...i simply did not 'get it'. it wasn't arty or quirky or challenging. i came away with only two thoughts: &quot;what did i miss?&quot; and &quot;bill murray is an actor who was not born for closeups&quot;.<br />while the japanese love of karaoke is good for a giggle or two,<br />a whole movie it does not make.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've only seen 9 episodes on this DVD set so far, and I must now join the chorus of hisses and boos at FOX for cancelling this brilliant show.<br />This has Whedon doing what he did with Buffy: set up an imaginative, exciting world (magic and monsters with Buffy, the far future with Firefly) and populate it with three-dimensional characters with real-world feelings you can relate with, and set up complex, evolving, and surprising plot arcs. <br />Just saw &quot;Out of Gas&quot; and it uses a clever story structure and plays with time to simultaneously create a real sense of doom, horror, AND mystery, all while narrating the current story, describing the history of how Serenity's crew formed, deepening our sense of each member of the ship, and showing the captain's love for his ship and crew... AMAZING!<br />Like Buffy, this show is exciting to watch because it experiments, all while still remaining entertaining and staying true to its characters. This show will appeal to non-sci fi fans, and though I love other sci fi, Firefly makes other sci-fi shows relatively contrived and amateurish.<br />I will watch the movie in 2005 and join the rabid fans demanding this get picked up on TV again! FIREFLY LIVES!!
B00009P1O2|4.0|this wembly show is queen at their finest.<BR>i saw them in kansas city 1984(?) and sat in the back of kemper arena right in the center just above stage height. the best place too get the full sound affect.<BR>i also got the privlidge to sit down with roger john and brian at the crown royal hotel before sound check and chat with them for about an hour drinking whisky sours.<BR>freddy wasnt around as always (according to them).<br />after that show i was hooked because of the incredible lighting and brian mays guiter genius.<BR>i went out and bought all the albums.<BR>(the old stuff is the best).<br />this dvd concert shows queen dressed as pro-musicians and not in stupid outfits like on some of the vids theyve done before.<BR>the color selection of white and yellow with red strips clothing perfectly matched their music.<br />i did not like the interviews they spliced in the middle of the show......all it did was give me an excuse to go to the john.<BR>also i never could figure out......why john deacon just stands there...like hes not part of the band.<BR>i wish he couldve been more buddy buddy and into the music with the rest of the band. (maybe its because he didnt get to write most of the music?)<br />queen music is magically done of coarse but......is roger taylor really the best drummer in the world?...hardly not.<BR>he just seems to carry the beat.<BR>(but he does have a cool drum solo during the concert).<br />all in all this show is one of my favs and i will never get bored of it. its one of those concerts you have to watch if youve just got heavy bills to pay or you just wrecked yer car.<BR>this concert will certainly bring you out of depression right from the beginning.<BR>its a very uplifting and musically stimulating show.<br />they should have left out the song delilah.<BR>(song about freddys cat?).<BR>during the middle of the song Bohemian Rhapsody they all vanish from stage and let the tape play the chorus parts.<br />great concert!
0618526412|5.0|The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a novel that will stay with you forever. Carson McCullers (only 23 when she wrote this!) writes profoundly with usage of every human sense. I agree that it is a masterpiece. <br />The story takes place in Georgia during the Depression. There is thick racial tension but music is solace and passion is ablaze. The world is a delicate place but the characters are cetainly not caucious within it. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a perfect representation of the spiritual isolation that is the shadow of mankind. McCuller's 'gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated...' and 'gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.' Everyone becomes someone through this story. It is beautiful, timeless, influential. One grows stronger by reading it and it can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life. A modern day comparison might be Geraldi's 'Lucky Monkeys In The Sky' because the isolation and search for beauty are very dominant in both novels.
0316666343|2.0|I also learned of this book second-hand. The referral came from an English lady who indicated that the book was taking her country by storm.  I read quite a bit, mostly bestsellers, but found this novel to be somewhat different from the mainstream.  The concept of meeting the narrator, Susie, the 14 year old girl already dead and in heaven was unusual, to say the least.  In a nutshell, I found the story to be too contrived.  The characters were not at all believable.  Susie's concept of heaven, and it being whatever we want it to be was cute, and offered the only bright spot in the book.  After that, with the introduction of Susie's family, the story starts to go downhill.  Like many other reviewers, I found Susie's mom to be the least likeable.  The fact that after enjoying a &quot;quickie&quot; with the lead detective on her daughter's case, she fled from one coast to the other, abandoning her remaining daughter and 3 year old son, because she couldn't handle the death of her older daughter was totally incomprehensible.  Susie's father's obsession with capturing the person he felt to be responsible for Susie's murder is told in a manner which seems, at best, uneven and clumsy.  Susie's alcoholic grandmother (who moves in and comes to the family's rescue), the daughter Leslie, a very mature 13 who finds solace in her boyfriend's bed, and the quirky friend Ruth, helped add improbability to the story.  The fact that the story stretches over eight years is also tiresome.  In the end, all the loose ends being tied up, even the unlikely death of Susie's murderer, was pathetic.  I read the book reviews, after having read the book, to see if I had missed something in my reading of it, seeing as how so many people were singing its praises.  I personally think that people so taken by the novel should perhaps read &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; as a sequel.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|I will say that generally, it is a good entertainment. Norton is the nasty guy and he's cool in it. The plot and the acting are good and even if the end is very predictable, I will say that this movie is full of pressure and entertain perfectly. Good Job!<BR>Don't expect a masterpiece after all.
B00000E2VC|5.0|I've had this album (vinyl record) for almost 30 years, one of my first records I bought in my adolescence.  Since then it's been my treasure.  When I first listened to it, it totally blew my mind.  I have since listened to so many piano pieces by so many pianists, but no other pianists (not even Horowitz) had such effect on me.  To this date, it still possesses the same power, and I get totally captivated by it every time I listen to it.  The record is now scratchy and worn, so I need to buy a new one, a CD this time perhaps, so it'll last longer.<br />I have read some negative reviews on this album, written by some experts.  That this is the worst recordings of Michelangeli, like he didn't know how to handle Chopin.  Well, that proves that you're NOT looking at a conventional, traditional interpretation of Chopin.  This is Michelangeli's Chopin, which is so unique and true, and noble.<br />I do notice, though, that his fast passages in Ballade and Scherzo are not as smooth and seamless as some other pianists'.  But what he is presenting is so powerful that I rather enjoy the roughness in them.<br />My favorite in this album are Prelude and Ballade.  They are so nobly done; I can't imagine anything better than these.<br />His intellectual, deep, and introverted sound will take you through a soul-searching journey, as if it's just you and him alone, conversing throughout.  He's talking to himself, looking deep inside himself, and you're invited to be with him.  It is therefore intimate and personal, and serious.<br />His pianissimo is highly meditative, profound and powerful, and in it his intelligence sparks; it'll take you to a higher plane.  By then you're completely his captive--you'll forget where you are, who you are, completely absorbed in his world.  But then he starts subtly knocking on your door, and suddenly boom!  The door flies open, and he's inside of you.  Amazing, amazing experience.<br />Ballade OP.23 is such a popular piano piece, every pianist must have played it at least once in his/her life time.  But Michelangeli's Ballade is a totally different one.  NO words can explain.  You just have to listen to it.  I love the way he handles the left hand throughout, the way he brings out the hidden lines and creates totally new music out of them.<br />His forte is a great release of power that has been building up in his pianissimo with such internal intensity.<br />I think he's one of the handful pianists who had the capasity to do justice to Chopin whose music is often vulgarized by careless pianists.  With him Chopin is on a much higher plane where he truly belongs.<br />Anyway, if you have the time to waste reading my poor review, just click the &quot;add to my cart&quot; button and purchase it.  It'll change your understanding of music, and Chopin, forever.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I've read all the Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian, and this movie stays true to their style.  This is not a swashbuckler.  It is the story of the extraordinary friendship of two men set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars.  The movie, like the books, is in no rush to tell the tale.  In fact, the sometime slow pace of the movie adds to the feeling of authenticity.  This is a great movie, but the hardcore action movie buffs will probably be disappointed.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|She doesn't understand that you can't be taken seriously nor can you make an impression when dressed like a porn star. In her new everything video she is talking about reincarnation while she sits there half naked walking around getting attacked by reporters. Maybe if she was dressed in descency I could have watched that without laughing. Although now when watching it I feel just sick.<br />She can't be two things at once, and she needs to understand that. You can't go be a positive influence while your in skimpy clothing and kissing Madonna. It just doesn't work. She can't live alternate lives, and if she tries both eventually connect, and everything goes wrong like it is now. I don't think she deserves to or should make a video involving religion (reincarnation)<br />I refuse to listen to a hipicrit.
B0001NBM1C|4.0|While this is an excellent film, and if it was anything more than a pastiche of a number of of different Patrick O'brian books, I would certainly have rated this with five stars, nonetheless, I can't help but be a bit disappointed that this movie was neither 'Master And Commander,' nor 'The Far Side Of The World.'  For those who have read the books, you will see all your favorite bits compiled in this movie (the 'lesser of two weavils,' etc), plus some truly stunning filming. The battle scenes are brilliant, and extremely accurate (perhaps more so than any other nautical period piece I have ever seen).  While the part of Stephen Maturin is sadly miscast (and he never gets to show off his role as a secret agent extraordinaire), Russell Crowe makes a surprisingly believable and effective Jack Aubrey.  However, this may have been a mistake as well, since the Jack Aubrey series by Patrick O'brian spans 21 novels, and Russell Crowe is nothing if not an expensive actor, I wonder if the movie people can ever afford to do any sort of a sequel of what is admittedly, a genre of limited appeal.  It may have been better to emulate the makers of 'Lord of the Rings and hire relatively unknown actors and film several films at once!  That said, any of you that enjoy a rousing sea-adventure will be well-pleased with this offering.  Enjoy!
B00000JG41|5.0|And of course it is.  These are the kind of musicians that only get better and better.  Because it is about the music.  It is about writing music that excites them - and it takes quite alot of work to accomplish this.<br />This is Bungle's pop record although most would not consider this pop.  California is a seamless combination of styles from Klezmer to Noise to Ballinese Gamalon, but it is all held together with a Beach Boys sound that is more apparent at some points than at others. This music is spectacular.  There are no limits for Patton, Spruance, Dunn, and Heifitz.  They make this collage of styles sound unified and natural.  <br />Personal favorites inculde: <BR>None of Them Knew They Were Robots<br />Retrovertigo (as close to a pure pop song as this band will ever have.  Love the Glockenspeil)<br />Air-Conditioned Nightmare<br />Golem II: The Electronic Vapor Boy<br />The Holy Filiment<br />It's all incredible.  One of my favorite records ever.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is the movie of a life! It's the masterpiece of Orson Wells in an awesome double DVD edition. Great documentaries, great commentaries. Too bad, Orson is not of this world anymore. I would have loved to hear his own commentary. Orson Wells was a genius, a prodigy and film this incredible movie practicing what we could call for this time, avantgarde angles, lighting. editing.... If you are interested in filmmaking and golden age of the American Cinema, pick this! UN CHEF D'OEUVRE and in my opinion the best movie ever made.

While this ranking seems a little high, there are a handful of good tracks on here that can be picked up on one of the greatest hits albums to avoid the filler on Sgt. Pepper.  2 stars.
B000002LKU|5.0|Take four Brits who call themselves \\"The Notting Hillbillies\\" and you'd expect a parody of American country music or -- worse -- slavish imitation. Not so with The Notting Hillbillies; they've made a CD that's dignified and classy and country-tinged. This is a CD that is original enough to listen to over and over.<BR>  <br />I especially liked the first and last songs on the CD.  \\"Railway Worksong\\" features extraordinary bluegrass banjo, guitar, and steel guitar runs and a strong vocal.  I would assume that most of the fancy guitar work is by Mark Knopfler.  The steel guitar is played by an American, Paul Franklin, who's as good as they come.  The second great song is \\"Feels like Going Home\\" which is bluesy and sung a bit like a hybrid of Joe Cocker and Van Morrison.  The notes to the CD, unfortunately, don't identify which of the Notting Hillbillies is the lead singer of these two songs.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I really tried to like this movie.  I went in with high expectations.  I had heard so much about it.  I love Bill Murray and I thought the premise sounded interesting.  I wanted to like it so much, I tried to convince myself as I was watching it, \\"Yeah, I like this.  This is good.\\"  Well, thirty minutes later, I realized it wasn't working.    Bill Murray plays a washed up actor that has traveled to Japan to do a Bourbon ad.  Scarlett Johansson is there with her photographer husband.  They are both feeling isolated and bewildered by their surroundings and gravitate towards one another.  That is the premise and it is a good one. There is a little sexual tension and there is supposedly a profound connection made.    I don't see it.  I did not see the connection made.  To make this kind of film come across, it must be sparse and subtle, but there has to be SOMEthing there.  The scenes between the two leads are so empty; nothing is expressed or communicated.  Therefore, the intended catharsis at the end falls flat.      Like I said, I really expected to love this film.  It sounded so promising.
1400049628|5.0|Finally, a man who understands the all-too-real threat of the living dead and who posesses the eloquence to present it convincingly! Max Brooks has produced a small wonder of a book in the Zombie Survival Guide, a book which provides the average American reader (through hands-on experience, published scientific research and historical accounts) with a comprehensive guide to surviving multiple levels of zombie infestation. Stripping away popular zombie myths, Brooks cuts through the morass of media misinformation with a book based firmly in the terrible reality of the undead. Easy-to-follow chapters on recommended weaponry, small-unit tactics and defensive fortification provide an easy entrance into the frightening world of the undead for the novice zombologist, while seasoned veterans will appreciate the elaborate instructions on how to survive the dreaded &quot;Class 4&quot; infestation.

B00005MP58|4.0|Although I love the story and actors, I find it unfortunate that the DVD has been produced without an option for subtitles in English for the deaf and hard of hearing. If anyone knows of a version I can buy which has subtitles as an option, that would be wonderful. My other favorite Jane Austen, Persuasion, has subtitles and I watch it all the time.
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley's &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is one of my favorite versions of the Arthurian legend. I first read the novel in the early 1990s, right after its publication. I reread it recently and was surprised at how much I enjoyed this extraordinary novel the second time around. I turned the pages more slowly and took more time to savor Ms. Bradley's excellent narrative and fresh version of the legendary saga of the rise and fall of Camelot. Her take on the classic characters gives them new depth and dimension. She tells her tale from a feminine perspective, and while the King and knights of Camelot dwell on war, battles and keeping their golden city and realm safe, along with focusing on chivalric honor, the women have different priorities and concerns.<br /><br />The tale is told from the points of view of the much maligned Morgaine, (Morgana Le Fey), Priestess of Avalon and Gwenhwyfar, (Gwynivere), Christian princess and future queen of Camelot. Although most of the events of the traditional Arthurian legend are presented here, it is extremely interesting how the tale, told by men, changes when viewed through the eyes and experiences of a woman. This is also the important story of the political and religious conflict between the new Christianity and the &quot;old ways&quot; of goddess worship. Believers of each religion seek to control the throne, but ultimately Christianity ascends to be the organized religion of the land. Since Morgaine is a Druid High Priestess, it would explain why she received such a bad rap in Christian civilization. The reader also views other famous female characters from a different vantage point, including Igraine, Morgaine's and Arthur's mother,<br />Ms. Bradley follows Morgaine from childhood to Priestess in her home on the Isle of Avalon, the center of Druidism and goddess worship since the Roman occupation forced the religion underground, where it remained long after the Roman departure. Mists surround this mystical isle, protecting it and its inhabitants from all who do not have the psychic powers to penetrate the barrier. Morgaine has dedicated her life to preserving her ancient religion and tries to defend it against the growing numbers of her countrymen and the Camelot royalty who exchange the old ways for Christianity. She is also a very powerful person and struggles against the stereotypes which expect her to adhere to more traditional &quot;feminine,&quot; (dependent), behavior and roles.<br />Bradley also follows the lovely Gwenhwyfar from the innocence of her girlhood to her rise as King Arthur's Christian Queen. She deeply fears Druid magic and her terror causes her to miscarry a long awaited baby. King Arthur's acquiescence to his wife's pleas to turn his back on the old ways and adopt Christianity is the beginning of the cataclysmic fall of his reign.<br />This is a most unique novel and Ms. Bradley's innovative fantasy version of Camelot, Britain during the Dark Ages, and the profound changes which took place in the land and among the people during this period had me riveted until I completed the last page. If you are open to a different take on a classic tale, then I highly recommend this wonderful novel.<br />JANA, protecting it and its inhabitants from all who do not have the psychic powers to penetrate the barrier.

B000002OVJ|5.0|I purchased this album completely on a whim.  I found it used with the special packaging that looks like an LP and has some interesting documentation of the live concert.  I spent my money extremely wisely when picking up this album.  I am a huge Clapton fan and love his live material, especially &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; with Derek and the Dominos.  I can only think of a metaphor to contrast the difference.  Clapton's performance is something like a virtuoso master, I picture a ballerina carefully balanced and crafting beautiful motion.  The Who live on this album is a whole other beast altogether, something like a mustang galloping full stride crushing the rock beneath it's feet.  The first time I heard &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; 1- I couldn't believe it was written my Mose Allison, 2- I was completely blown away.  I find it hard not to listen to this song as loud as the stereo will go.  The guitar is driving, the band completely forceful.  If heavy metal began somewhere, it was on this album, for sure!!  I highly recommend you buy this album, you couldn't possibly regret it.
B00006ADFL|5.0|If you haven't noticed, this guy knows how to make a movie.  This is his best, in this reviewer's humble opinion.  It will knock you out.  The performances are wonderful, as is the direction and the art design.  Jackson really gives you something to look at.<br />Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story of two teenage girls who murder one of the girl's mother.  The two girls share a special closeness - too close for their parents who fear lesbianism and endeavor to keep the girls apart.<br />In order to depict the girls' special relationship, Jackson uses his cinematic magic to create another world where only they are real and everyone else is an animated statue.  These scenes are truly dazzling and make this film a must for true fans of great cinema.

B000006MS3|5.0|This is probably one of the most original recordings I have ever heard. I first heard this back in the 80's and songs such as &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot;, and &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; still give me chills till this day. It usually goes for cheap prices nowadays so I suggest picking it up.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I have followed Shannon Larkin's career since seeing him live in Keyser, WV in 1983!  He was awesome then and even move refined and improved now.  I saw their concert in Wheeling WV on 4/18/2004 and it was the best concert that I have seen in years.  Sully and Shannon got into a drum duel and of course, Shannon won out, Sully don't give up your vocal's job!  My best to the band, keep up the good work and buy their latest album The Other Side, even your wife or girlfriend will like the mellow stuff.  It really is excellent as is this band.<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Mark Roth

B00005JMJ4|4.0|I saw this movie with my friend and i really really liked it! Sure, its slow paced but thats what makes this movie so unusual. It's also very realistic and not soo fake, like other movies. It's like looking at a sneak peak into these people's lives. Also, its very funny too. Seeing Murray totally bewildered by these Japanese people. I thought it was a really thoughtful, in a way educated movie. Just a smart, worth watching movie. This is not a trash movie. Watch it!!!
B00005Y7L4|4.0|in the near future the Government comes up with this sick idea to try to control the (&quot;) (UN&quot;) out of control youth.each year they pick a class of teenage students rebelious or not it seems,they bring them to a deserted island and force them to kill one another till there is only one survivor.AND THE LESSON IS!!!punishment for the unlucky class that got picked and i guess a scare tactic for the rest of the youth of the country/world. there is alot more to it i just don't want to ruin it or give anything else away.the special edition dvd comes out looking great and there are a bunch of features BUT!!! on my special edition directors cut none of the special features have subtitles so you can't understand anything anyone is saying(it has subtitles for the movie but not the extra's???????)anyway all &amp; all the movie is great the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because alot of the dialog was bad and unreal for example(if i just got stabbed/shot/burned whatever my last words in my dying breath would not be telling this pretty girl holding me in her arms that&quot;I THINK YOUR COOL&quot;?????????????? no one would choose those words as there last words!!!!!!!!!!!the other thing that bothered me was the speed of the subtitles(TO FAST!!!) &amp; alot of confusing unfinished sentences in the subtitles as well,sometimes as the viewer i didn't know how to take the dialog sometimes it would feel like im watching a movie for kids &amp; then sometimes it would feel raw and real like i was watching a ARTISTIC MASTERPIECE!!! those things didn't help at all but they by no means ruined the movie either!!!! like i said all&amp; all the movie is great!!!!! SCARY SCARY CONCEPT because its not so far fetched THESE DAYS!!! GOOD ACTING/DECENT DIRECTING/GREAT PACE/MASTERFUL ARTISTIC CONCEPT!!!/AND LAST BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE LEAST PLENTY OF BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD!!!!!!!HURRY UP AND FIND THE DVD YOU WILL ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0440237688|4.0|Lois Lowry, a prolific young adult author with many titles to her name, has stepped outside of her usual lighthearted and humorous works to write a science fiction novel that may surprise many of her readers.  In The Giver, Lowry creates a safe utopian society, where the people act and look the same, where everyone abides by the same rules.  On the surface there are no problems, yet the characters in the novel are human enough to make the reader sympathetic to their fate.  Conflicts begin to arise when the main character becomes aware of many inherent problems in the society.  Jonas, the major character, is a boy who lives in this society and the plot of the novel is based in part on the transformation of Jonas from a model and very important citizen to a rebel who chooses to turn his back on his family and world.  The climax is reached when the characters are forced to find a solution to their conflict, however the ending of the novel is inconclusive and the readers must supply for themselves what happens in the end. Recommended for all school Libraries.<br />Michael J. Spencer
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Don't get me wrong.  I loved Master and Commander which I call a thinking man's swashbuckler.  It definitely is a great plot and worthy of an Oscar Nomination.  What I have gotten used to and missed here was the commentary that usually comes with DVDs.  If you want that, you have to pay for the 2CD set...:-(<br />Also, if you have a regular TV (30 inches or less) the letterbox effect of the wide screen version cuts out 50% of the viewing area, which ruins the special effects that made this movie so awesome in the theaters.<br />The Wide screen version is a good investment for the future.  If you want to see the action up close, get the regular version and if you want the commentaries and the making of the movie (which I do) buy the 2 CD set.  For 6 dollars more, you get your money's worth.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is one of my all time fave albums, love nearly every song on it. Good to blair when you're driving in traffic.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran's albums are completely filled with filler material, with only a couple of hits. But all the filler was vaporized and condensed into a hits collection that truly rocks. Perhaps, this is the only essential Duran Duran disc that you may ever need. Yet, it is almost impossible to gather all the hits of a great band and put them on one single disc. This was the mistake, since all the songs are shortened in order to fit all the 19 tracks. \\"The Reflex\\" has no digital remastering because it sounds awful. \\"Save a prayer\\" has a short introduction, not allowing you to hear the cool-sounding synth. There are remixes that are usually included in hit collections, but none are here. Still, who needs the remixes? If you do not know the titles to the songs, I'm pretty sure you've heard many on the radio already. In conclusion, \\"Greatest\\" is a true gem.
B000024A70|4.0|I wouldn't call it a complete greatest hits album, as some of the stuff on here isn't that good to my ear. I generally like oldies station and classic rock station Queen. Bicycle Race, Killer Queen, Etc. Anyway, all those songs are here and for the price it's great. However, there are other songs on here that I've never heard before and aren't too hot to my ear. Like Bijou, Now I'm Here, and Save Me. I think they could have filled these with some other hits that are in the fantastic Queen catalog instead of these songs (like Stone Cold Crazy, Spread Your Wings, I'm Coming Out). Anyway, I know this is just my complaint and that anyone that is an enthusiast is going to think I'm a retard for dismissing a song like Bijou so you should probably buy this.
0743454529|4.0|Critical reviews of this book have complained that the characterization of Sara, the mother devoted to saving her sick child no matter the cost to her other children, was poorly done, but honestly I thought this was a very true picture of a woman obsessed, and one of the truest characters in the whole book, however narrow-minded.  She has extreme tunnel vision, and her charater reflects that.  I would have liked to have read more of how that did or did not change after the 'surprise ending.'<br />The book is well-written and up until the end, a very enjoyable, just-one-more-chapter-before-bed read.  My biggest complaint about the narration was that all the characters 'read' like adults.  A nice feature of the story is that each chapter is told from a different point of view.  Each character has it's own voice, but each voice seems to come with the same life experience.  Anna, while a mature thirteen year old, often uses references and metaphors out of synch with her life experience.  There is a girlishness to her, but she often comes off sounding thirty and not thirteen.<br />My only other complaint was the ending, which might seem like a 'surprise' and and 'ingenius twist' to some, but really just struck me as a modern day 'deus ex machina' ending.  Guess what, what you thought would happen didn't and what didn't think did, and no, we're just going to skip ahead to the future and gloss over the fall out.  Maybe I just don't 'get it' but after reading such a carefully crafted book, the ending was rushed and it seemed to me that the author had this great 'twist' idea, but only after the first 98% of the book had been written.  After all the building and deep writing, the almost shallow end disappoints.<br />I will provide the disclaimer that I am the type of person who is often critical of endings in general, and some people might really enjoy it.  However, I would still recommend the book.  It's worth getting to the end, whether you like it or not.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Love this album, nearly every song is a gem
0446530891|2.0|I never got interested in the characters, they didn't seem real and the plot wasn't believable. Plus, almost everybody gets bumped off or kidnapped as soon as they are introduced. The great mystery of the &quot;elevator distraction&quot; was a big plot flop and I found it to be annoying. I couldn't understand why we had the reason for that fatal distraction withheld until so late in the book.<br />The only reason the main character (an ex-secret service agent) is a lawyer is because that's what Balducci writes about. <br />This book is a who dunnit, but I never cared who dunnit. It seems to be the result of the pressure put on successful authors to crank out more books.
0156027321|5.0|Every so often, you read a book that provides insights on a number of subjects while telling a great story.  This is one of those books.<br />It's a story of a 16-year-old boy, nicknamed Pi, in India who works at his father's zoo in India.  In a restless search of meaning and understanding which so many of us go through at that age, he becomes a Christian, Muslim, and Hindu nearly simultaneously.  The zoo moves to Canada and all the animals and his family are take a cargo ship to their new destination.  When the ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific, Pi's family is lost and he's adrift in a lifeboat with a wounded zebra, orangutan, hyena, and a tiger named Richard Parker.  In a few days, it's just Pi and Richard Parker drifting aimlessly in the Pacific.  <br />The story touches on spirituality, animal husbandry, survival instincts, religion, tiger training, and the logistics of staying alive in a lifeboat.  It is also very compelling story of a young man struggling to co-exist with a dangerous animal in a confined space, and the unspoken relationship that develops.  <br />I think you will find this one of the most unique, memorable stories you've ever read.
0316666343|4.0|I approached this book unsure if an author could pull off writing an entire novel from the perspective of a murder victim.  Alice Sebold accomplished this and more.  The Lovely Bones is a gripping and poignant book.  Although it is somewhat sentimental, after all the narrator, Susie Salmon is 14-years-old. I felt the sentimentality was a necessary part of Susie's voice and revealed her character. Author, Alice Sebold, avoided gratituous gorey detail to lure readers into the book and, relied instead on a solid, well-told story.  I had a difficult time putting The Lovely Bones down, and after I finished it, the story (or was that Susie?) haunted me for days.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I had low expectations going in to this movie but was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was.  What was more surprising was to see how many low ratings this movie has received here at Amazon.      I think part of the backlash is resentment over some overt 'borrowing' of material from other films.  Significant elements of Underworld's storyline have been recycled from Blade II.  The Matrix's influence on the visual style was unmistakeable and--in 2004--no longer looks fresh and original.  What's more, several of the action gags seemed oddly familiar (a leather-clad female diving head first through a tiny window (Matrix).  A bad guy stabbing through a roof with an arm-sword to get the good guys (T2).  Monsters who choose walls and ceilings in lieu of terra firma when traversing a hall (Aliens)).    The underdeveloped love sub-plot didn't work for me either.  In this respect, the storyline was a little too lean and mean for its own good.  If the filmmakers expected the audience to buy off on the romance between the female vampire lead and the human, they needed to lay a better foundation.  In fairness, there were other motivations for her to do some of the things she did, but they didn't justify all of her actions (or risks) absent a romantic interest in the human (which again was underdeveloped).    The creature effects for the werewolves were very good.  The one disappointment was with the hybrid vampire/werewolf.  It was supposed to have been a super monster, but it looked much less menacing than even the standard-issue werewolves.  And while it initially appeared to have physical prowess vastly superior to even the toughest vampire, that misrepresentation was quickly put to rest in the subsequent action.  After the built-up anticipation, the payoff was a bit of a letdown.    Despite the negatives I've just listed, I find myself giving Underworld a thumps-up recommendation.  A tight script yields a film that hits the ground running and pretty much never stops.  If by some chance you've not seen the earlier-referenced films (alien abduction?), you might actually be blown away by this movie.  Regardless, it's worth checking out.  While Underworld may not be ground breaking, the sum of the parts add up to a fun evening in front of the home theater system.  Three-and-a-half stars.
630280082X|4.0|Thanks, Steve from Antelope, CA United States. I was on here looking for information on the release of the movie &quot;Crossroads&quot;<BR>I hope your release date of 8/26/04 is correct, I can't wait.<BR>I saw this movie back in 86' and loved it. I play guitar, and if<BR>you play guitar,I think you'll enjoy this movie. Blues is really the foundation for rock n roll. Trust me, if your just starting out on guitar, there's nothing like learning some old blues licks<BR>to get you going.<BR>      Anyways, Great guitar dual at the end.....this is really where the movie sucks you in!!!
B000002O7C|4.0|I love Basil Poledouris. He has written some terrific movie scores and this another one.<br />The Hymn to Red October is the reason to buy this soundtrack. The russian chorus like somebody said earlier is awe inspiring. They sound absolutely terrific. You'd think they were the mormon tabernacle choir singing in Russian. It's fantastic.<br />The rest of the soundtrack is ok. No other songs really jump to you and they are very short. Some of the songs are under minute long which is very disappointing. The music was so good in the movie.<br />I was disappointed the song the russians sing on the sub was left off the soundtrack. I don't know the name of it, but I love the song. It sounded terrific in the movie and it would have been nice to hear it here.<br />Like I said earlier Basil has written another fantastic movie score. His fans will definetly want to pick this one up. Fans of the movie might want to consider it to. Fans of movie scores should also pick it up, just be expected to be disapointed by the short length.

B0000TLA9G|1.0|A true GnR fan would not support something that was against the consent of the band. Of course, these songs are great, even the covers. But go to a cd store and buy &quot;Appetite&quot; or the &quot;Use your Illusion&quot; series for the same songs AND more. I for one, am insulted because this is likley the last Guns album you will ever see (I am starting to think Chinese Democracy will NEVER be released and besides, thats like GnR2, its not the GOOD Guns, its Axl's final attempt at making himself feel special.) I hate to see a good thing end in an insulting manner. Do yourself a favor and forget the Greatest Hits album.
630469878X|5.0|I saw an interview with Susan Sarandon, and she said that \\"Thelma and Louise isn't about feminism, it's about human liberation.\\" I completely agree.<br />If you put the sexual politics aside, what you have is a story of two human beings who have spent their whole lives being oppressed and controlled by other people. Louise (Sarandon) is a waitress with a tragic past and an unreliable boyfriend. Thelma is a housewife with an arrogant, controlling husband. The two decide to embark on an impromptu vacation, but while stopping for a couple of drinks at a redneck nightclub, Thelma is almost raped by a lecherous customer, and Louise shoots and kills him in the parking lot. Instead of going to the police, the two decide to skip the country and head to Mexico, but a string of unfortunate events forces the two to commit even more crimes, turning them into bona fide fugitives and outlaws.<br />Strangely, what the two characters discover is that their new lives as outlaws are more satisfying than the stifled lives they led before. At the end of the film, the two make a choice to remain free and never surrender, despite the consequences.<br />This film asks the question: is the only way to be free in our society to be an outlaw? The answer just might be yes.
B000003TA4|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD, I wished I had bigger speakers, excessively powerful amp, two 1000W Subwoofers, and a much bigger house so I could play this thing so loud that my neighbours had to call the cops and have me sent away for life. Or maybe get the house soundproofed. Though this wasn't the first time I felt like that (that credit goes to Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; and more specifically &quot;Jeremy&quot;). Bottomline is, you'll prob never make it through the CD for a month. You'll prob have &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; in repeat mode for a week. Then you'll have &quot;In Bloom&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; alternating for another week. Hopefully, you'll make it to Polly a week later and at the end of the month, finally appreciate the Cello(What???A Cello on a Grunge Record??? Cool!!!) on &quot;Something in the Way&quot; <BR>This record can be called overproduced, stripped-down from Bleach, MTV-Friendly and all other things by Critics and &quot;hardcore nirvana fans&quot; who'll tell you this CD is nothing compared to In Utero. But the thing is, these ARE two very different records and it's entire possible some may hate one and love the other. But trust me, a lot more people would love NEVERMIND. <BR>Only question is, why hasn't an album that sold over 10 Million records and is often billed as a &quot;Best of Genre&quot; or &quot;Best of Decade&quot; not yet been released on SACD or DVD-A?

B00012QM9K|5.0|I remember waiting years to see this film on a DVD transfer, and I'm disgusted with reading the complaints about the dual-sided single DVD that requires you to flip the disc half-way through the film. Is that all you people can come up with to judge one of the most coveted releases on the DVD format?<br />Let's talk about the technical merits of the DVD presentation. The video and sound quality are superb; this is certainly the finest treatment this film has ever received and for the price of what Amazon is offering, the Collector's Gift Set cannot be beat. Because this film was so late in getting released, no doubt it has had the benefit of better restorative methods to preserve and enhance the original print. If anything, we should also thank the studios for releasing this film with the Collector's Edition the same time as the standard widescreen release, instead of trying to force the consumers to double-dip on two different versions.<br />The price of this set at Amazon clearly beats any B&M store in the country. I haven't seen a single person criticize the video and sound quality, the CD soundtrack, the book or limited senitype, and if you are a true collector only that should matter. The plexiglass case is prone to cracking (most likely due to being dropped during shipping), but is clearly a defining piece to your DVD shelf. <br />Regardless of what you think of this film, this is one of the finest (and cost-friendly) Collector Edition sets ever released, period.
0440180295|1.0|While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.<br />Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax.<br />I prefer Daniele Steele, and there's no basis for telling me I'm wrong. Vonnegut is no better or worse than Daniele Steele!
B00005JMTQ|4.0|This was a great movie.  Nicholson's character was a gigalo who ran around with very young women but was not happy as most people would think he should be with so many young, physically attractive girlfriends.  Keaton's character was a divorcee showing Nicholson she \\"\\"can do it to\\" by seeing a younger man and, contrary to stereotypical belief about older women dating younger men, she was not happy, either.  Both characters finally realize that physical fulfillment is only a temporary kind of joy.  They find their way to true contentment in each other, two much older people but close in age to one another, by pealing away their former shallow expectations and finally giving in to what truly matters.
0446677450|5.0|In my opinion this is a great book, It is easy to read and gives you a lot of things to think about.<BR>I have read the reviews and many people give this book bad ones, those people are the ones that are going to be poor for the rest of their lives.<BR>One review said: &quot;If it is so easy why isn't everyone doing it&quot;<BR>Well maybe they all think like you, Maybe you should open your mind and try new things, Don't be affraid!!<BR>What this book does is make you think, it is not going to tell you how to do things step by step, it will give you the main idea and the rest is up to you, don't foget when years go by, things change, 10 years ago the formula might have been different,it is all about the main idea and how you use it!!!<BR>I agree with people say that the writting is not the best, but don't forget he is not a writer he is an investor and he wrote this book in the way he thought it should be written, Just read it, enjoy it, try to absorb as much as you can and get motivated.<BR>I loved the book!!
0385504209|2.0|This has been on the top seller's list for a while, everyone is talking about it, and I don't understand what the big fuss is.<br />I don't really see where the controversy comes in because people with at least some education or who do even the littlest amount of research (google, anyone?) will easily pick up on how genuinely ridiculous some of Dan Brown's \\"facts\\" are and understand that it is a work of fiction. But, I don't care about the factual validity to it because it *is* a fiction book. It looks to me that because he isn't the best writer, Dan Brown had to take (very) generous license to make everything to fall into place.<br />What I care about is that it isn't even incredibly entertaining. It has an extremely formulaic approach and is filled with little \\"puzzles\\" to solve throughout. Maybe it's just me, but I grew bored with puzzle-solving before I even hit high school, which worked out well because these puzzles seemed to be at junior high level in difficulty.<br />His main character, Robert Langdon, has more knowledge of what is going on than the reader, which always feels like a cop-out on the author's part. If an author won't reveal to the reader what the character already knows, it's usually due to an attempt to keep the reader turning the page to find out the tidbits that are kept secret since the story won't retain their attention; this does work, but it never makes a good book.<br />Dan Brown seems to excel in this technique and I must admit that I found his writing so mediocre that if it wasn't for my irrational desire to figure out certain plot points that Robert already knew and wouldn't tell us, then I would have stopped reading. A good book should be able to reveal everything to the reader that the main character knows and still keep the reader hooked, because otherwise, why bother telling Robert's story if the author's not even going to tell it?<br />Also, I hate chapters that end with \\"dun, dun, dun!\\" so you have to start the next chapter to see if the person really loses his or her head or if the hero really caught the bad guy only halfway through the book. Yet again, another writing stunt I thought I had left behind when I stopped reading Nancy Drew.<br />I did like the historical sites sprinkled throughout, from museums to cathedrals to chapels; it was fascinating to learn about some places I've never heard of. Again, he took great license with the historical facts, but at least, because of my curiosity, it led me to do research on the locations and find out some interesting facts about medieval landmarks.<br />The only reason I can figure that such a poorly written book is doing so well is because of all the publicity generated over the \\"controversy.\\" The reason I picked up this book is because I bought into the \\"everyone is doing it, so it must be good\\" mentality. My recommendation? Don't bother.to see if the person really loses his or her head or if the hero really caught the bad guy only halfway through the book.

B0000640SB|4.0|The movie Men In Black was a good movie to me. It was creative and exciting. You never knew what was going to happen next. When it first came out in theaters me and my sister saw it there twice. If they made another sequel I would go and see it. The antogonists were the aliens because they wanted to see the main characters downfall. The protagonists were Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. I don't think that anyone else could have played there parts any better.
B00005KARK|4.0|I remember when I first saw this as a young child, I couldn't believe how horrible it was for him to get separated from his mother. Also, I remember being really scared during the dream sequence with the dancing clowns.<br />Watching it again, after so many years, the clowns still scare me, but the mother child separation isn't so terribly angsty for me anymore, which might have to do with growing up.<br />This is a great movie for young children because it deals so well with the parent-child bond. It also teaches children to believe in themselves and not be ashamed of their differences.
0380789035|4.0|It was difficult to not give this book 5 stars as I really enjoyed it and had trouble putting it down when I had to. The idea is a very original conception and I liked the main character and how he dealt with all the strange things that are happening. The imperfections are that its too long and wanders off story from time to time, and most importantly for me was the intimation for hundreds of pages that a big battle was brewing and then the ending instead was a pastiche of too many different elements and just kind of  petered out. All in all though, a great read.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|I had heard some truly wonderful things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it. Mona Lisa Smile tells the story of a professor (Julia Roberts) who starts teaching Art History, or Appreciation, or something at Wellesley (an all-girls school). There are several big name young actresses-I mean students in her class. And they're all know-it-alls. <br />The movie wants to be the \\"girls' version of Dead Poet's Society\\" so bad that the creators of DPS should be looking into a slander lawsuit because it is insulting what they do to what was originally a really good movie. Katherine Watson (Roberts) came to Wellesley to make a difference and she was not going to take no for an answer. So, when the actresses-I mean students outsmart her, she has to make the class more difficult. Because I guess they're not *really* learning until Watson has taught them. And Watson is not going to just teach them about Art. No. She's gonna teach them about *life* and that they don't have to get married and have babies. They can be whatever they want because they are soooo smart. And if they want to get married and have babies, then they're just in denial. Because Watson knows everything! Sadly, no one dies unlike in the original DPS. <br />There's the antagonist, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), who hates Watson, but in the end, loves her the most. The protagonist, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), who respects Watson, but in the end teaches Watson a life lesson. The morally ambivalent wanna-be, Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who wants to be Watson. And the \\"ugly, fat girl\\", Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin), who just wants to be liked by a boy. <br />Most of the acting was very cardboard. I am not sure whether to blame this on the script, the director, or the actors. Julia Roberts looked exactly the same as she has looked in her past 5 movies. Same \\"smile\\" theme, same bursting laugh, same \\"unliked-girl\\" who really is a pretty woman (ha!) deep down. She's turning into Meg Ryan by picking the same character over and over again. <br />Kirsten Dunst's character was a little too whiney and in the end, when Betty Warren does the \\"morphosis\\", it is not believable. Even if it was believable, then we wouldn't really care because the way she was portrayed would be akin to feeling sympathy for Atilla the Hun.<br />Julia Stiles was the only one whose character seemed to remain consistant. I am not sure if this is because of her acting or because the script didn't call for a \\"character evolution\\". Either way, Joan was still boring and lifeless.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal is beautiful and sexy and boy is Giselle a sexually free spirit in this movie. Hmm...Secretary, anyone? But, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that student-teacher relationship/affair thing. Maybe I fell asleep and missed it.<br />For the life of me I could not figure out why they thought Ginnifer Goodwin's character was fat or ugly so, we'll just ignore her because her character has no conflict! <br />For that matter, nothing at all anywhere in this entire movie does...<br />Oh, did I fail to point out that the title is mentioned throughout the movie at least eleventy-billion times? I bet the writers did this on purpose to encourage drinking games since that's the only way they could get anyone to willingly watch the whole movie to the end.
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott is a director among the highest caliber and I have been a fan of his for quite some time.  I love the original &quot;Alien&quot; and his fantasy film &quot;Legend.&quot;  &quot;Gladiator&quot; was another good film with a strong visual sense with rich performances (especially by Oliver Reed, in his final role) and grand production design.  For some strange reason, I hadn't seen &quot;Blade Runner&quot; until this year.  It's a film that didn't do particularly well upon its release in 1982 (especially since the director's cut is ten times better), but has had a cult following since then.  Hell, I'm a fan of cult films, too.  As you might have come across my &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; review, I love a film because the film is good, not because it won so many academy awards.<br />Anyways, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is set in the 21st century in a bleak Los Angeles.  By this time, there are several Earth colonies and mankind has ventured forth with only the poor and the helpless staying behind on Earth.  Mankind also invented &quot;replicants,&quot; machines made to look human and only have a four-year lifespan.  Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a &quot;blade runner&quot; (assigned to terminate replicants) who must battle with four replicants (played by Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassidy) who have killed an entire ship and escaped to Earth.  Rutger Hauer plays their leader and the so-called &quot;prodigal son&quot; that was meant to be the toughest replicant.  Deckard discovers another one named Rachael (Sean Young) that is VERY close to being human (in other words, she can't be detected easily.  She required 100+ tests to figure out if she was a replicant.).  Deckard does as he is ordered, but finds himself falling for Rachael, and the other replicants simply went back to Earth to increase their longevity.<br />The film has an OUTSTANDING visual style, but that is to be expected of Ridley Scott.  I loved his fantasy look for &quot;Legend&quot; and here he brings out not your every day-sunny day California.  This is bleak, dark, and very much in the film-noir fashion.  Plus, the music score by the great Vangelis (&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;) is excellent, with melodic saxophone moments and at other times in a hyperdrive electronic fashion like the end titles.  The only thing I could 'probably' degrade the film for is that you find yourself not connecting with the characters.  The best way to describe them is that they're vague.  Then again, the film's focus is not entirely on the characters.<br />At first, I found myself with a lot of people (including Leonard Maltin, who I think misses the point...) who didn't like the film because it was hard to follow.  After watching it a second time, I caught on more of what it was about.  It's a movie that'll take some growing used to (it has a brooding pace that might not be appealing to today's viewers who are used to &quot;cut, cut, cut&quot; action).<br />Do I recommend this?  While I found myself loving the film in the end, it's not one to instantly get into.  The deep philosophical notion here is that life is precious, and we humans tend to see humanity in ONLY humanity.  Here, we have a lot of people, not just replicants, who are poor, hungry, handicapped, and what the like.  Humanity's disservice to humanity, and even the replicants have humanity in them (near the end, Rutger Hauer gives a very compelling speech about his own death.).  Once I figured out the message of the film, I loved it all the more.  To the sci-fi enthusiast, I definitely recommend it.  Others might not have any desire to see it.  On the other hand, I highly recommend that a second viewing be applied, for it took me two viewings to analyze it.<br />PROS: Grand visual style, Compelling story and message, Excellent music score, Astonishing production design, Dark ending.<br />CONS: Characters are somewhat undefined, Film requires two or more viewings which might turn off the casual viewer.<br />To sum it all up, this is a great art film that must be seen to believed.  Watch with care; you might dislike it at first, but it'll grow on you the second time around.asual viewer.<br />To sum it all up, this is a great art film that must be seen to believed.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Released in Japan in 1984, Nausica explores many of the themes later visited in Princess Mononoke, and proved highly influential to modern day anime, from plot elements to even the mecha design (the \\"Evas\\" from the series Neon Genesis Evangelion, considered by many to be the best anime released to date).  This film is certainly no mecha anime; the young princess Nausica finds herself torn between her people, mankind, and nature, the brutal, ascendant force on earth after the fall of man.  Is humanity doomed to extinction, or is the equilibrium that Nausica espouses the ultimate answer?  Nausica herself is a blend of Greek heroine and nature-loving adolescent, and strongly foils the other, Machiavelian characters.  Though in a post apocalyptic future, Nausica feels little like Mad Max and more like primordial civilization as seen in Princess Mononoke.  Hayao Miyazaki goes into even more depth and creates an even more epic tale in the manga (graphic novel) Nausica, so if you cannot wait, look it up.  An incredible story, it is unfortunate that Disney has not decided upon a full theatrical release...
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I'll make this quick, excellent soundtrack..<br />I just wanted to point out that the track called &quot;Super 16&quot; is an excerpt from track of the same name by a '70s German rock band called Neu!.  I'm assuming Tarantino used it in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; because it was used in the soundtrack to &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;, a great martial arts film. It was the theme music whenever the &quot;Master&quot; appeared in the film.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: THERE ARE N-O C-O-V-E-R-S ON THIS RECORD. A cover is NOT a recording of a song you didn't write: a cover is a recording of a song intended to smother (or COVER, hence the term) another recording of the same song in concurrent release--if, that is, and only if, both are released as singles.<br />This is how the practice arose: Federal law says that once a song has been published or commercially recorded anyone may re-record it without permission as long as he pays the standard royalty fee also set by federal law. Since that royalty fee is absurdly low (if a record sells a million copies, the composer gets about $5,000), professional song writers typically negotiate a hefty one-time payment for the first recording. A cover is a sneaky way to circumvent that hefty one-time payment; you let someone else record the song first, then you COVER that recording.<br />I'm sorry if that explanation sounds complicated or involved or abstruse to you, but the term is strictly an inside industry term, and the moral is: if you aren't an inside industry person (or at least if you aren't a person who wants to trouble himself to find out how the industry works), then don't pretend to be one.<br />By the way: this is a very good record.
B0000DJZB9|1.0|Dear GunsN'Roses fans, I exchanged this DVD and the 2nd copy had the same problem as the first. The audio has these high and low points. The volume on a few of the videos went from the volume I had my television set on, then it went down to a lower volume on it's own, then back up. It's a shame because I would really like to have these videos on DVD, however I will be returning this 2nd copy and demanding a full refund. If you bought a copy of this DVD and the audio isn't messed up, hang onto it  because you're lucky. I did notice after the fact that there are some other reviews from people that had the same problem with their copy. So buy at your own risk.(...): Exchanged once again because refund was refused. Same problem with 3rd copy. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM!! Save yourself the trouble, time and money.

B00009NHC5|5.0|I love classic thrillers, and this is definitely one of my favorites. Audrey Hepburn convincingly portrays a blind woman who, unbeknownst to her, has a heroin-filled doll in her apartment. Two recently parolled con-men and one coolly sinister killer will stop at nothing to find that doll. <br />Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, and Jack Weston all perform wonderfully in their roles. Especially Arkin; his Harry Roat character is one of the best villains in cinema history. The only qualm I had with characterization was Hepburn's husband, played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. His character seemed too callous, and his reaction at the end of the film was terribly written, acted, and directed. But he plays a minor role in the film, so it doesn't affect the overall quality of the picture. <br />Although nearly every scene takes place in Hepburn's apartment, that does not diminish the film's suspense or terror. In fact, this increases the effectiveness of the climax. To reveal any more details about this film would be criminal, though. Stay \\"in the dark\\" about the details of this film until you see it, then watch it in the dark. Like other reviewers have said, it's WELL worth it.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie was amazing.  There are 8 main characters in the story, which at first  was intriguing to see how they would all tie together.  But they did, in fun easy to follow way. <br />It is a very witty movie, which effortlessly captivates the audience.  All the different love stories, the unexpected turns, made this movie unique.<br />It shows how love can arrive unexpectedly and not always wrapped neatly in a package.<br />If you are a Hugh Grant fan then you will love this movie.  His character however is not the only one you will love.  Many of the actors become very endearing to the audience by the end of the movie.<br />A must see and a must buy.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|I just bought this album the other day, and i can't believe how good it is. This band before initially becoming a band, was prone to long conversations about art. i dont know about this ablums artistic significance but it definitely is catchy. anyone who says they can listen to &quot;Take Me Out&quot; without tapping their foot, is lying. They have a kind of glossed over elegance that almost sounds obnoxious. &quot;Dark of the Matinee&quot; is one of the funkist songs i've listend to in a very long time. It's hard to find enough things you like in their music. Along with Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand anounces the second comming of intelligent rock music.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Despite what some critics say, this isn't a movie about pedophilia. Its a movie that describes one very average Joe trying to find a greater happiness. There is a counterpoint about a completely misfit and unique young man whose eyes have already been opened - and sometimes he doesn't know if he can bear all the beauty. In my opinion, the meaning of American Beauty is spelled out for the audience in the scene where Lester grabs the sofa cushion and berades Carolyn, \\"ITS... JUST... A... COUCH!\\" In the following moments, Lester sheds some light on his spiritual changes, but they're not complete. No, getting the fast-food job wasn't the answer... trading in his car wasn't the answer... and just before seducing the fantasy girl, he realizes that wouldn't be it either. That's key: he realizes it beforehand. When talking to the little blonde after their encounter, he's just an inch from enlightenment, very close, stretching, reaching... now do you see why he's smiling at the end, and why the misfit isn't upset? Far too many people misunderstood this movie because of  a knee-jerk reaction to superficials, instead of considering the underlying meaning and the director's intent.  In any event, the folks who criticized this movie were taking it way too seriously. Kevin Spacey was hilarious. He nailed the role of a disillusioned and disenchanted surburbian man caught up in a rat race he wanted out of. So he fantasized about his daughter's best friend, he ended up \\"doing the right thing\\" in the end. I loved his new car and \\"career change.\\" Just the scene in the drive-thru window when he sees his wife was worth renting the movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This short-lived series by Joss Whedon is an excellent blend of the SF and Western genres. As with all Whedon's work, the characterization is sharp, humorous and spot on. There is a large cast about whom you will care almost immediately, and the acting and FX are all first rate. Unfortunately, &quot;Firefly&quot;  was not well promoted and after being moved around was cancelled before all the episodes were even on TV.<br />However, all 14 episodes made are on this set, together with many extras including commentaries by Whedon on several episodes. Also,  a feature film, &quot;Serenity,&quot; has recently been announced for 2005. If you need another positive review to convince you to buy and watch this show, well this is it! Highly recommended.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Most people think of explosions, car chases and action/adventure films as guy movies. Well, maybe, but those are for boys. There's no car chase in this movie, no deaths and no guns. But it manages to hold your attention while telling its story of real estate salesmen. This is the quintessential guy movie. This screen adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer-winning play is incredibly stagebound, which was a stroke of genius: thus, the fast-paced dialogue and the desperate, macho facades of the characters become, and stay, the focus. This allows the amazing talents of the cast to flourish. Pacino and Lemmon are untouchable. Ed Harris is outstanding. Having just the four main characters makes the whole thing seem oddly forced at times. Baldwin's slick delivery of his ball-busting speech to the three underachieving salesmen, is a scene to remember. Highly recommended.
B00018D44U|5.0|This is the greatest record to come out this year. I mean it's sold a lot of units. You sort of wonder what it's all about. I got an early copy of her first record too and couldn't believe it sold eight million copies. Norah Jones is talented and beautiful. Unlike Britney Spears, she is having no problem connecting with that adult audience. Whereas her first record had more of a jazz vibe, it was also definitely a smooch pit record. This time she brings in more country stylings. She covers songs by heavy hitters Townes Van Zandt and Tom Waits. If those fellows were poor last year, all that has changed. You listen to this record and it slides down the hill like melted snow. As you read this, in this few minutes, this record has already sold one hundred more copies. You already own it. You know what's going on.
B000050FEN|5.0|Kevin Spacey has reached the top of the spooky scale with &quot;Seven&quot;. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play two detectives on the trail of a maniacal killer who is leaving bodies throughout the city, each with messages of the seven deadly sins of the bible. As the movie progresses, the race to catch the killer becomes more frantic and the story becomes even more thrilling. Also gracing the screen in &quot;Seven&quot; is Gwyneth Paltrow. All the actors do a great job, and make their characters very believable. &quot;Seven&quot; is a wonderfully, suspenseful movie that will have you on the edge of your seat to the end. &quot;Seven&quot; slashes it's way to five out of five stars and to the top of the must see movie list.
B000089RVR|4.0|Is it possible for honesty to be redundant? Here we have a whole album that doesn't stray too far from the previous hit \\"Here With Me.\\" Some of the TV shows that Dido was featured on aren't around anymore. Although a show about a thirty something loser who can't find a boyfriend is dying to made so it can feature the song \\"White Flag.\\" Dido, the most criminal person since Celine Dion, has a talent for the earworm. Those songs that you can't get out of your head. Life For Rent is breaking no new ground. It's doesn't make the leap from first Portishead to the second. The sad fact is that there are a bunch of Dido clones like Jem looking to crash the party. But is it only bored and homely women in their thirties who live like Bridget Jones who eat this stuff up? I guess the song \\"See You When You're 40\\" is a shout out to all her fans. Dido is someone who is not good enough looking to be a pop star. She has middling looks and you think that YOU even have a chance with her.
0156027321|4.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is the winner of the Booker Prize and was given a ridiculous amount of critical praise.  It was given so much so that I was a little unsure about reading it, that it could not possibly live up to the hype.  In one sense, I was right.  The novel did not live up the hype of the critical praise.  However, this is not to say that \\"Life of Pi\\" is not an excellent novel or that it was not a fine piece of literature.<br />This is the story of Piscine Patel, or, Pi as he comes to be called.  Pi is sixteen years old and lives in India.  His father is a zookeeper, but because of the job situation in India the family is leaving and moving to Canada.  Since their zoo is closing, they had to sell the animals to other zoos, some of which are in Canada and they are helping to transport some of the animals before settling in their new country.  Somehow the ship sinks, and Pi ends up on a lifeboat...a lifeboat that he happens to share with a tiger.<br />Can Pi survive?  How does Pi survive?  How can a novel be interesting when the majority of the pages take place with a 16 year old boy on a raft with a tiger?  Surprisingly enough, this is an interesting novel and I actually cared to find out how it all played out.  It was fascinating to see how Pi was able to survive day after day (and not get mauled by the tiger, later named Richard Parker).<br />I don't think \\"Life of Pi\\" is going to make my list of favorite books, but Yann Martel was successful in holding my attention throughout the novel and made me want to keep turning the page to find out what happens next and how it happened.  Good book.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|The film (the original I mean) is excellent and if you are a floyd fan and have not seen it, the DVD is worth buying. The reason that some people rated this dvd low is, i suppose, because of the director's cut version. To set things straight, if the dvd had not included the original version of the film, it would not be worth buying. The director's cut version is quite lame (to say the least). Anyway, as far as the original film is conserned, the video quality is superior to the VHS version and the sound quality is great though it could have been better.<br />Overall, this dvd is definitely worth owning if your are a floyd fan and you have not seen the film before. Great shots of the band just fooling around!
B00007LTIA|4.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans has got to be one of the most challenging albums I've ever heard!<br />I have never heard this album before until the Rhino remaster.<br />I've heard Ritual before from the YesYears box set, so I kinda knew what to expect.<br />At first it was a real challenge to listen to the first CD. Especially the 2nd track Remembering.  <br />Once I heard it a few times I decided it was a very good set of songs.  Not Yes' best though.  There are several moments of pure brillance and a few moments of total boredom.<br />But on the whole an excellent album.  The highlights for me are obviously Ritual and The Revealing Science of God.<br />A-
B00000JRTX|3.0|I had heard so many good things about this film that when I finally saw it, I was surprised to find it so very disappointing. The story revolves a group of people who constantly find themselves at weddings, and yet they themselves never get married. At one wedding Charles (Hugh Grant) is entranced by an American woman, Carrie (Andie MacDowell). Upon finding that they are staying at the same hotel, they end up in bed together. The following day Carrie returns to the States, leaving Charles forlorn and alone. A few months later Carrie turns up at another wedding, announcing that she's engaged to someone else. Nevertheless, she and Charles hop in the sack once more. Carrie then proceeds to marry her fiance, and Charles continues to pine for her, wondering if perhaps he should settle for any ordinary woman rather than wait for the perfect one.<br />The entire plotline is rather shaky to begin with, though it could have been done well, with some tweaking. But the main problem is that the romance between Charles and Carrie just seems utterly unrealistic. They meet for the first time, barely speak two words to each other before sleeping together, and Carrie promtly leaves the next morning, and yet Charles is madly in love with her. Why? They have nothing in common, know nothing about each other, and have known each other for one day. Carrie's idea of conversation is detailing the bedroom talents of each of her 33 lovers. And she sleeps with one man while engaged to another!<br />The movie is further dragged down by the fact that there is not a whit of chemistry between Grant and MacDowell. As I watched them, I felt... nothing. Not boredom or disdain, but just a big flat resounding nothing. Grant acted very well, and MacDowell did a passable job with a less-than-ideal role, but the two just don't work together. I know Grant can do a great romantic comedy - I've seen plenty of his other movies - but MacDowell is clearly not a good match.<br />The rest of the cast was fairly good. In fact, I enjoyed the numerous sideline romances far more than the central one. There are many funny moments (though a couple of the jokes fall horribly flat), and even a couple touching ones, just not between the main characters where they should have been. I liked many of the other characters, and found myself rooting for their romantic success rather than Charles and Carrie's. They actually interact with each other, whereas the relationship between Carrie and Charles seems to be based only on the fact that they've slept together. The movie wasn't an entire waste, and connoisseurs of Hugh Grant should see it, but it's not one I myself would watch again. I'd recommend it as a rental only.good.

B00006LLNU|5.0|WOW, that's all I have to say. This record deosn't even need a review.
B000001DYD|4.0|I think just about every reviewer here has used the words \\"raw\\", \\"abrasive\\", \\"disturbing\\", and passionate to describe this album and I can't say anything to dispute them. Picking up where DRY leaves off, RID OF ME is an anguished wail punctuated by heavy-rocking riffs of violent humor. <br />1. RID OF ME: The ultimate anthem of revenge and love that won't let go. \\"Tie yourself to me, no one else, no, you're not rid of me. This song starts out deceptively slow and quiet and just when you feel comfortable inching the volume up, the bitter refrain comes exploding into your ears, jolting you out of your complacency. One of my favorites.<br />2. MISSED: Told from the point-of-view of The Virgin Mary as she watches Her son get crucified. Polly Harvey seems almost maternal in this song as she gasps in a voice filled with pain, \\"My son, where's he been. Good Lord, he's been hit! No, I missed him.<br />3. LEGS: An anguished, obsessive wail of female hysteria. I didn't care too much for this one at first, but now I can't help but think it is one of the most disturbing tracks on the album. Beginning with the almost indistinguishable cry, \\"Oh, you're divi-ine\\" and ending with the hate-filled declaration \\"I might as well be dead... but I could kill you instead.\\"<br />4. RUB `TIL IT BLEEDS: Again, for some reason, I didn't pay attention to this one too much when I first heard it. Then, one day, I just found myself reaching for it and I've loved it ever since. The second most disturbing track on the album-I would give anything to know what she is singing about. I love the way this song is paced, it's slow monotone guitar become more frenetic, interspersed with harsh drumbeats as the song progresses. My second favorite.<br />5. HOOK: A tribute to the old Irish ballad \\"I'll take you home again, Kathleen\\" told from the heroine's sarcastic point-of-view. Reminiscent of some of the tracks on DRY.<br />6. MAN-SIZED SEXTET: I don't get this one. To me it just seems like a great song is being butchered. See my review of the standard version of MAN-SIZE for track #10.<br />7. HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED: A cover aimed as tribute to one of Polly's favorite artists. Having not yet heard the original version, I can't say how it compares. A cacophonous song that seems to be serving as a satire of some kind.<br />8. 50 FOOT QUEENIE: The biggest hit of the album. Harsh yet funny from it's opening chords. A parody of ego and arrogance, which could be applied to either a male or a female. Check out the video for this one which has Polly dressed like a deranged 1950's housewife, running loose around the studio spray-painting the walls.<br />9. YURI-G: Although you would not guess it from the title, this song is actually supposed to be about the moon. It is kind of in the same category as HOOK. There is something enticing about lyrics like, \\"I drew her down on me, I drew her with a smile... Yeah, I wish I was Yuri-G, it's just the things that she does to me.\\"<br />10.  MAN-SIZE: My favorite track on the album! For some reason, I can never get tired of this song. Sometimes, I even play it more than once. A real classic rock song which gains intensity and speed as it progresses, finally climaxing with PJ Harvey's wailing \\"Man-size, man-size, man-size...\\" and an ominous final stanza. For the most part, the lyrics to this song are great fun, the type of thing you want to belt out in your car with the windows rolled down. \\"Got my girl, she's a wow; I cast my iron knickers down... My babe lookin' cool and neat, I'm pretty sure good enough to eat.\\" I would love to find the video for this song.<br />11.  DRY: The ultimate female cry of dissatisfaction. Maybe she's talking about something more than just the literal meaning in the lyrics. Then again, maybe not... Personally, I'm not a fan of this one simply because it's kind of a slow ballad that is kind of mellow but not in a way that is bittersweet or pretty.<br />12. ME-JANE: Tarzan's story told from Jane's angle. The drumbeats in the beginning resemble the cacophonous noise of the jungle. Another song that I really like. Again, it's hard-hitting and empowering with it's command \\"Don't lord it on me!\\"<br />13. SNAKE: Polly Jean's own tribute to the plight of Eve at the hands of the serpent. Very short, includes the sound-effect of Polly Harvey seeming to choke on her own breath.<br />14. ECSTASY: This song seems to be the indicator of the metallic, theatrical direction the band is heading in on the next album \\"To Bring You My Love\\". An almost heavy-metal song, takes a format different from all of the other songs in that it doesn't really seem to be telling a story. Again, however, this is one of my favorites because its lyrics just seem to flow so naturally even though they are almost about nothing. A fitting conclusion!<br />When I first listened to this album, I was almost disappointed. I couldn't understand what all the hype was about and had trouble seeing how RID OF ME was any different than DRY. However, as I kept listening, I found gems in unexpected places. Indeed, where DRY simply aimed to make audiences blush at its references, RID OF ME makes them gasp with it's lyrics of hard-hitting poignancy that are always uncomfortably accurate. It's worth noting that after this album, the trio \\"PJ Harvey\\" split up and the band became exclusively Polly Harvey's property. Listen to this album and enjoy it as one of the many stages Polly Jean Harvey passes through as she attempts to make music that will chill us
B000089RVR|4.0|I thought this record was excellent.  Her lyrics are so real that almost anyone could identify with them.  There are some songs that are not that catchy but overall is a worth buying it!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mocking Bird is my favourite book. I think that it deserves 6 stars! <br />When Jem and Scout Finch find a small boy hidden in the cabbage patch, named Dill, they make good friends with him. But, Dill leads them into trouble, and as his thirst for knowledge increases, he leads Jem and Scout into danger. <br />But this is not the only danger the children should have to encounter. Powered by rage, when Atticus Finch, Jem and Scout's father, accepts to laywer a black man, a drunken fool flys into a rage and attacks the children<br />This book almost made me cry when I read it, but it made me laugh, too. It will always be one of my all time favourites, so if you're thinking of buying a book, this is my top reccomendation.
0425166805|1.0|Although a fun read, the basic logic of this book is that our ancestors were primatives who were incapable of achieving the kinds of accomplishments that exist, and therefore, the wonders of ancient civilizations must have been created with alien knowledge!<br />People 3,000 years ago were every bit as smart as we are, and had generations to study, to learn, and to build.  Were there alien encounters?  Maybe, but the facts presented in this book do nothing to make that case.<br />This book should be read with a critical eye.  The archaeological experts may not always be right, but they are more open minded than Mr. Von Daniken in their search for answers and explanations.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  This is a sleeper series.  Totally worth watching.<br />Get it.<br />'Nuff said.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie is hilarious!!! We could not stop laughing. Jack plays a man who dates no one over 30. He goes with his then girl friend to her mother's (Diane) beach house in the Hamptons. Unbeknownst to them, her mother and aunt are there! After a little embarrassment, they all decide to spend the weekend there. Jack has a heart attack and they rush him to the hospital. Once released he must stay nearby for a few more days and the only one available to take care of him is Diane. Thus the story begins of their fling--there are so many funny moments of trying to read the clock, mixing up their reading glasses, Jack walking in on Diane naked... the story continues with more fun. The movie is full of truths--men do like younger women, but also shows that middle aged women are still beautiful as well. Keaneu Reeves plays the doctor and he is the only bad part of the movie--he's such a terrible actor. He should only do The Matrix movies and Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure he was fine--so either a surfer dude or someone with no personality or emotion like Neo in the Matrix. Other than that, this movie is a real winner! Lots of fun!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film hits every part of your emotions - from laughter to tears and everything else in between.  I was awestruck by the way he was determined to protect his son from knowing the real reason they were taken away from their home and all they knew.  His endless strength and love to keep his child from knowing fear broke my heart.  It's an effort that, as a parent, I can realate to.

B0001DI0FI|2.0|After waiting, purchasing, and watching this movie I have no idea why it was granted the accolades it was. Peter Weir is a very good director but has little to work with as Crowe goes beyond character and tries to utter failure to not be a part of the movie but be the movie itself.<br />In Weir movies often the landscape becomes a character in and of itself - think for instance of Picnic at Hanging Rock. However here he loses this advantage and opportunity. I know that the Hollywood money men make decisions to formula but keeping Weir from creating the landscape character of the ship and sea is really inexcusable.<br />A universally poor cast and script lead this film into the depths of mediocrity which is such a shame.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is a feel good movie..in fact is a feel very good movie, one that is superbly written, but then it is not surprising coming from Richard Curtis, a man who has forever changed British Comedy back in 1979 with Not The Nine O'Clock News launching as a result the careers of Britain's most loved comedians, like Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, and Griff Rhys Jones.<BR>Curtis also co wrote with Ben Elton the classic Blackadder and showed an early talent and understanding of a highly sophisticated,satirical,intelligent as well as hilarious type of comedy. His venture into movie writing was as successful, and Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are now considered as classics.<BR>What is surprising though is Curtis's abilities as a director. He has managed to tell his own script with such ease, sympathy, and simplicity, and to direct more than twenty main characters, each to a varying degrees with a three dimensional and deep personalities.<BR>Love Actually is actually a film that combines some very funny scenes with a lot of poignancy...It is all about love as we know or experience it.Love that crosses language barriers, love that means sacrifice, love that is dedication, love that can be an instant infatuation, love that means forgiveness, love that means fantasy, love that means to just be there, love as in hope, in short love as in life..There are ten stories of different kinds of love that occasionally cross paths, colorful canvases of different people, and different relationships, and different loves.<BR>The casting could not have been better, from Liam Neeson, Laura Linney (one of the best American and most underrated actresses),Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman,Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy and two of Curtis's personal friends from the old days, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.There are also plenty of very well cast cameos, from Billy Bob Thorton as the American President, Rowan Atkinson as a salesman (although he is billed as one of the mainstars, his role is actually very small),Sienna Guillory, Claudia Schiffer, to January Jones and Denise Richards.<BR>The most hilarious dialogues and scenes come courtesy of Grant as the prime minister!! You should just hear what he says talking to the painting of Mrs Thatcher!! But every one contributes equally to make you laugh, smile, and reflect..<BR>The film starts and ends at Heathrow, with the images of people greeting, hugging and kissing each other and a very touching narrative tells us about how the message of the plane passengers of the 9/11 tragedy in their final calls was about love and forgiveness and not hate and revenge. It is ultimately the message of Curtis himself, and throughout the film until  the end you realize just how significant and true this message is.     <BR>Love Actually is a MUST SEE movie that is totally endearing, one that will make you feel so good about love and life!  <BR>DO NOT MISS!
B000002H33|5.0|Ok at first listen I was in awe, fastforward to like the thousanth time I listened to this, Im in awe! This is that damn good! Metallica's Master Of Puppets is one of the greatest albumd I have ever heard! It has to be in like the top three metal albums of all time, this is like Black Sabbaths Paranoid, Iron Maidons The Number Of The Beast, Alice In Chains Dirt, or any other legandary metal album you can think of.<br />'Battery' is a killer speed metal song and is perfect to open up the album. 'Master Of Puppets' the title track, long hailed as Metallicas all time greatest song, well not quite but almost. This has one of Kirks best guitar solos. 'Thing That Should Not Be' is fast but its slow but its heavy if you can understand what I am saying. Well for any Led Zeppelin fans out there this is Metallicas Lemon Song. 'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)' is Metallicas second best song of all time, Fade To Black being the best. But the guitar is mind blowing, and the lyrics are bad a**! 'Dispossiable Heros' is a killer song, with a great riff and cool solo. 'Leper Messiah' is one of my favorite songs on the album, its really fast, hard, and heavy, truly one of Metallicas best songs. 'Orion' is Metallicas all time best instrumental, its perfect and never boring it shows the true talent of this band. 'Damage Inc.' closes out Master Of Puppets and its fast and loud and heavy, its almost dare I say it punk? its a great end to and amazing album by a killer band!<br />Master Of Puppets is an album that no one should be with out, and yes its that good!
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Rush - Live In Rio?  Now, who's the one stuck in the 80s - or 70s for that matter.  I don't think anyone would but this CD if they weren't a fan of 80s music.  If so, this is a must have.  Not only are the hits (Rio, Hungry Like The Wolf & Save a Prayer) solid, but there really isn't a weak song on here.  My other favorites are The Chauffeur and Hold Back the Rain.<br />Anyway, I'm a Rush fan, but I consider them to be more dated than Duran Duran.  The day is coming soon when someone will remake a Duran Duran song and it will be a hit just like No Doubt with It's My Life from Talk Talk, and other similar remake hits as of late.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I must say I am a candy cane child, so any bias in this review is just natural to me. Before I write this review I want all readers to realize I have heard all of the white stripes catalouge, so I will make comparisons. First off, forget seven nation army, it's the only song of it's &quot;sort&quot; on the album. In fact the majority of the album is made up of catchy chord progressions and Jack Whites obscure slide guitar solos. This, for whatever reason, I'm completely alright with. I say this because my preference in guitar consists of maniacal riffs with insane &quot;finger&quot; solos, if you will. But White provides some of the most entertaining guitar I've heard since, well, dare I say, Kurt Cobain? Songs like Black Math, Girl...Medacine, and Hypnotyze will do just that, they'll put you under a spell! I was hoping for some more bluesy tunes but I guess thats what De Styjl is for. Thats not to say there is an absence of blues...check out Ball and a Buiscut, one of the Stripes best to date! I was very saddened by the fact that even after some major success, people still whine about Meg Whites drumming...unless your a musician at heart, you won't know the difference, trust me. I think most people who read this are probably here for a good pop album and if that's what you are looking for, you will find it in songs like, I want to be the boy to warm your mothers heart or the irresistable, You've got her in your pocket. The latter song being one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard.Period. Oh and if you don't like Megs' drumming, maybe you'll settle for a vocal performance, eh, eh? I'd buy her album any day! Over all, I'd say this is their second catchiest album, first being White Blood Cells. In all I'd put this album up against De Styjl for the number two slot of best White Stripe album since nothing beats the self titled debut. I give this album five stars since it's an album of a dying breed, thats to say, it's a good one.

B00008LDPU|5.0|Even though it isn't live action, this collection of animated shorts expresses the vision and the issues of the matrix series far more clearly than the films.  If you liked the first film, this DVD is a must.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|My only major disappointment with this is they left off one of the best performances in the film. I had never heard of Sam Brown before this,but WOW!!! Her voice on You Can Take a Horse to Water just blew me away!! Everybody else is superb as well. McCartney's emotional preamble to Something is especially touching.I love his simple ukelele take on the song. Albert Lee who I'd never heard before does a tasty sizzling guitar solo on Honey Don't.It's a really enjoyable show. You also realize as Jeff Lynne and Eric Clapton mention in the film, that these songs are so strong and musically interesting for all these artists. Almost all of them have ties to the original recordings. It's also obviuous they're all having a wonderful time.George's songs are of course the centerpiece,but Joe Brown(another unknown for me)does a beautiful rendition of I'll See You In My Dreams to close the show.It is all very touching and fun to watch.
0380789035|4.0|Whatever happened to the gods of old? Gods like Odin, Loki, Thor, Horace, Ibis etc. What happens when the civilization that worshipped them no longer exists, or no longer believes in them? What happens when the gods of old become antiquated and are replaced with the gods of today, gods of commerce, technology, and media? That is the premise of \\"American Gods\\" and yet the book is so much more than the encapsulated sentences. As immigrants came to America with their beliefs, the gods of old found America a horrible place to plant roots of spirituality. The spiritual meccas and shrines of today can be found in monuments such as Mount Rushmore.<br />So what happens if the gods of old decide to make a stand and force out the present gods?  Or is it truly a stand they want to make? And how did one ex-convict become so important to this approaching storm?<br />I found myself utterly compelled by this book. It was a novel that not only did I have a hard time putting down, but a hard time explaining. Part fiction, part fantasy, part religious treatise, \\"American Gods\\" is not an easily definable book, and for that I am glad.<br />This is the first book I have read by Neil Gaiman, and it will not be the last.

B000065V1V|4.0|I notice a lot of people are calling Heathen Bowie's first &quot;great&quot; album since 1980.  I disagree.   I like the Heathen album,  but there's something about it that keeps it from being in the same league as Reality or Earthling,  and nothing on this album IMO is as great as either Heart's Filthy Lesson off Outside and Thursday's Child off ...hours.<br />On the pro sides...  I thought it was great to see Bowie working with Visconti again.   There's some GREAT songs on this album too.   Slip Away and Slow Burn being the highlights in my opinion.<br />This is certainly a good album,  but  I don't understand why people make it out like it's the only decent album Bowie's done in the past 20 years, when I wouldn't even say it was his best in the past decade, as I think everything the man's done since 1993 has been worthy.   Now check out Reality, Bowie's most flawless album in 20 years.
0790729628|5.0|As a teacher assigned to 'teach' this film to my 17-18 year old students i am astonished at their regularly nonplussed, or otherwise indifferent reaction to this movie. The movie is truly a classic of titanic proportions. Rutger Hauer's final lines in the movie are rivalled only by Sheen's closing remarks in Platoon, pointing to the tragic transience and fragility, as well as the wonder, of life. They are an ode to or a celebration of human experience and to the beauty of nature and reveal the hidden truth of Tyrell Corporations motto, `more human than human'. He feels and cherishes life more desperately in his 4 years than humans seem to in their lifetime, lost and drifting in the spiritual ennui which defines them.  The desperate, 'film noir', atmosphere of the film is delectable. The dialogue is superb. Ah the joy...
B0001611DI|4.0|This movie is pretty good but before i bought it my brother told me that it was very gory!!!!  But when i got it it wasnt as scary and gory as i thought.  Actually at some parts in the movie were just plain boring.  I haven't seen the directors cut but it is probably better than the U.S. therical version.  At some parts of the movie were good like the part when the gang of bikers go in the mall and the zombies rip that guys stomach open that was pretty cool. But if you haven't seen this yet i suggest you should buy the directors cut.
0743454529|5.0|This book was riveting, touching and brilliantly written - I couldn't put it down! Jodi Picoult beautifully and skillfully tells the story of a close-nit family, that faces extreme tragedies and triumphs, based on the middle child's leukemia diagnosis at age 2 (the afflicted child, Kate is 16 when the story takes place). After she is diagnosed and needs a bone marrow transplant at age 2-2 1/2, her only other sibling (4 year Jesse) is not a suitable match. Her parents make a decision to conceive another baby who is genetically &quot;engineered&quot; to be a match for Kate. Most of the story takes place in the present, when the youngest sibling and donor, Anna, is now 13. She seeks legal representation when she decides (as far as the reader knows) that she wants medical emancipation from her parents, when she does not want to dontate a kidney to Kate, who is in renal failure at age 16. The story is told in flashbacks and we get to know this family as told from each of their perspectives, and get a heart-wrenching view of how devastating a child's illness is on an entire family. The legal, medical, psychological and familial aspects of genetic engineering and the moral/ethical questions that arise from it are geniously portrayed in this must read novel!!

B00000JCOV|1.0|This piece of crap is punk not metal. Seems like the guitar players only know 1 riff ( like punk ). The vocals sound like every other so called &quot;death metal&quot; ( death punk ). I agree with an ealier reviewer, 9 band memebers and this still sucks
B0001LJCMK|3.0|Imagine the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion as pot-smoking teens in the 70's, doing bong hits as they jam to old records by Crazy Horse and The Sweet, preserving it all on a beat-up 4-track recorder. A dual-guitar grind fest, with zero bass and rudimentary, almost mechanical-sounding drumbeats. Sometimes these guys get a really good groove on that makes me smile (as on Kiss the Devil, or the fantastic San Berdoo Sunburn), but a lot of this CD leaves me a bit cold. But, I get the feeling these guys might be a lot of fun in concert, and I can't wait to hear CD #2.

B003JTHWPA|5.0|\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" examines the theme of abandonment and the isolation of the artist. The protagonist, Mick (teen aged girl) is carelessly raised by parents who ignore her and are barely making it. She is left to grow up unappreciated and unnourished. She forms a friendship with John Singer, a deaf-mute, the very embodiment of isolation and misunderstanding. The deaf man takes in a troubled companion, a clerk in a grocery who is mentally ill but seems to offer the man the love and companionship his affliction has denied him. The two live in a sort of fool's paradise which, as will happen, all comes undone.<br /><br />The sketching of the characters of small Southern town life is spare and unerring. It is interesting to compare McCullers' work to that of Thomas Wolfe (\\"Of Time and the River\\", \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\"). This Southern great wrote a decade or so earlier than McCullers and his style was florid and very much rooted in the 19th Century. McCullers version of a semi-biographical tale is distinguished by 20th Century economy and precision. The sharpness of this writing is some of the best in American literature.
B000059T1G|5.0|The studio tracks are pretty much a lot of perky puffery.<BR>BUT........the live stuff is the most brilliant singing and playing of Mr. Winwood's career. This kind of stuff is the essence of what the fillmore was all about in the sixties. Great musicians freed from the confines of record companies and stardom taking listeners on a sophisticated journey through their influences and gifts to songs that are quite out of the ordinary. Winwood sings a broadway show tune and turns it into a moving musical moment. Instead of the hackneyed chord progression of Dear Mr. Fantasy (based on the most abused cliche of the 60's, the Hey Jude ending)Blindman is the essence of the blues. Does anyone know where the rest of this concert is?
B0001DI0FI|4.0|If, like me, you are considering the \\"Special Edition,\\" please know that the deleted scenes are not integrated with the rest of the movie, and are more like extra footage. Many are just topics with multiple clips on the subject, like \\"Superstitions.\\"<br />I am a big fan of the books and the movie, so it was worth the price for the other background material, but I was hoping for a longer movie.<br />Overall, a truly great movie and a great DVD to own. If you haven't, read the books! Peter Weir truly captures the spirit of the whole series.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I HATE YOU BRITNEY SPEARS. YOU CAN'T SING. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO. I SAW THE FOOTAGE OF YOU ON STAR SEARCH WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE. YOUR VOICE WAS AMAZING AND RESONANT. NOW YOU RUN AROUND WEARING....ALMOST NOTHING AND YOU SING IN YOUR THROAT. WHAT HAPPENED???? THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT SONG IS CALLED TOXIC: WHOEVER LISTENS TO IT DIES!
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|I agree with the guy that said this is one of the greatest films ever made, this is currently my favorite all time movie and this is the uncut international version, you get 24 minutes of footage not shown in the U.S., I recommend you get the Superbit version for optimal picture and sound, this is a must buy!!
B0001Z363W|5.0|Zakk Wylde has done it once again. There are so many influences in this album, each with his own touch. This album mixes so many different styles and is completely different than all his others. While so many so called &quot;artists&quot; out there are afraid to try something new, or just don't have the ability to, Zakk doesn't give a crap about trends and shows it with his new album. And the assclown that said the album wasn't good because Zakk writes all his music in the studio doesn't know what he's talking about because Zakk writes ALL his albums in the studio so that doesn't matter. Zakk is the best rock guitarist out there period.
B0001HAISG|5.0|It's much, MUCH better than ANY Peter Pan adaptation I've seen! It was heartbreaking! The director, Hogan, really captured the pain and tragedy of both Peter Pan and Captain Hook. So yes, don't expect any of that Disney stuff, because this movie is filled with emotions and deep messages. I even got teary-eyed a couple of times! <BR>For the first time, you will see Peter Pan for what he really was: a victim of his own stubborness-a young tragedy. Even Hook knew this, while Peter himself had no clue. <br />This film's got everything: Romance, comedy, drama, action, suspense-so I suggest you get the DVD. It's a truly amazing movie that would someday go down in history as an enchanting classic. It definitely deserves more attention than it's getting.
B00008ADPF|4.0|RATING: 4/6<br />This is a great rock album, more good songs than bad songs, but overall they're all ok/good songs. I'll write a rating for each song,<br />01. Flat on the Floor (GOOD SONG 5/5)<BR>02. Do This Anymore (BAD SONG 2/5)<BR>03. Someday (GOOD SONG 5/5)<BR>04. Believe It or Not (BAD SONG 3/5)<BR>05. Feelin' Way Too Damn Good (GOOD SONG 5/5)<BR>06. Because of You (GOOD SONG 4/5)<BR>07. Figured You Out (GOOD SONG 5/5)   <BR>08. Should've Listened (BAD SONG 3/5)    <BR>09. Throw Yourself Away (GOOD SONG 5/5)<br />10. Another Hole in the Head (GOOD 4/5)   <BR>11. See You at the Show (GOOD SONG 4.5/5)<BR>12. Saturday Night's Alright (GOOD SONG 5/5)<BR>13. Learn the Hard Way (GOOD SONG 5/5)  <BR>14. Yanking Out My Heart (BAD SONG 3.5/5)<br />The few stand out songs would be &quot;Figured You Out&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night's Alright&quot;, &quot;Throw Yourself Away&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Flat on the Floor&quot;, and &quot;See You at the Show&quot;. If you're a fan of rock music with a great quality sound, you'll enjoy this album.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Well...whatever this CD is worth it if you don't have the original Illmatic yet...otherwise, it's not worth getting the CD at all...just another CD with remixes on it and a small web preview.....you would spend $16 just for that if you already have the CD...not worth it.<br />But as for the actual music on the album...I had only heard clips of illmatic before I got this, I'm that sucker guy you can all bash on now for not having the album in the first place. When I bought this, I knew what I was listening to was a classic because of these reasons:<br />1. The first REAL street poet album where a story is told to you with one of the best lyrical flows the rap industry has ever witnessed.<BR>2. Original beats by Q-Tip, Large Professor, and best of all, DJ Premier<BR>3. Paved the way for the rappers you hear now, unfortunatly.<BR>4. Lyrically, an INCREDIBLY detailed album for its time and still is today.<BR>5.The first mainstream-marketed rap album I've ever heard to sound like an incredible underground production.<br />Overall, this version of the album is definitly worth every dollar if your money...but only if you don't have the original version. I rest my case.
6305513406|1.0|Ok my quick gripe here, 18.00 a vol., only two episodes a vol.<BR>NO WAY!! I just paid almost 700.00 for the entire seven seasons of TNG, Paramounts money grubbing little fists will have to do better on TOS if they want any more of my cash. <BR>  Put 3 box set's out there, 1 per season. At about the same price (or maybe less because we know you wont put jack worth of extras in it) as TNG's. Stop trying to rip-off your largest fan base Paramount!!!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this guy, so I went and bought the CD...it is incredible! I love it! I love his voice! <BR>BUY THIS CD...you will not regret it! It's my favorite right now!
B00006879E|5.0|This is by far one of the best bands out there.I'm so glad that they were able to make it into the entertainment mainstream, mind you it took one year for them to finally get noticed. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes powerful romantic  ballads. Maroon 5 is an amazing band and the songs are beautifully written. All of the songs are great but my favourites are &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;All.  All I can say is go out and get yourself your own copy of &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; and I guarantee that you will not end up being disappointed.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I have to say that yes, Jet does sort of sound like most of the other retro-Aussie-insert word here bands, but they still manage to put their own stamp on things.<br />From the get-go, you can tell what kind of stuff you're in for. The first line in &quot;Last Chance&quot; says &quot;You ain't nothing to me if you have nothing to say,&quot; which in itself says a lot. It's a great little song that I haven't got tired of yet- after pressing the play button about a trillion times.<BR>&quot;Are You Gonna be My Girl&quot; is still as thrilling as it was months ago, before everyone and his grandmother knew the words.<BR>&quot;Rollover DJ&quot; is a lot of fun, and even if you don't like it at first it grows on you, and becomes the sort of energy-creating drug that half this album is.<BR>I know that everyone from Oasis to Rufus Wainwright to the Beatles has done this sort of song, but &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; manages to be mature and innocent at the same time. I got to see Jet live recently, and this was the only slow-tempo song they chose they chose to play. Lighters abound, and everyone knew the words, even the crazy moshers who calmed down for those few minutes.<BR>(I'm skipping around the order of songs now)<BR>&quot;Cold Hard B****&quot; is yet another great-sounding rock song, and a perfect choice for their second single.<BR>&quot;Move On&quot; has a wonderful, introspective quality to it. It's great and still slightly heartbreaking.<BR>&quot;Lazy Gun&quot; is probably my pick for best track on the album, just because of the way the song's tone jumps and the wonderfully strange sound it has. It's so weird that it has to be catchy.<BR>&quot;Timothy&quot; may not have been the best way to end such a rockin' album. It's an excellent, honest, wrenching song, but it leaves you so melancholy after you got such a high from the other tracks.<br />Even though I didn't mention all of the songs on the album, they're all noteworthy. It's one of the best albums I own; Ican hardly bring myself to press the stop button. It's original but familiar, fast but emotional, fun but sad. It's great.<BR>(By the way, Jet is a great band to see live. Just remember to bring a water bottle to avoid losing your voice.)
B00005JLKB|5.0|The entire first season is such that I watch each episode with earphones on and a bowl of cereal.  I do this over and over again.  I grew up with Superboy and his superdog Krypto. By the way, what ever happened to Krypto? Anyways, the script answers many questions as to what Clark was going through growing up as a teenager in a small town.  I can sense his wanting to grow up now, attitude.  His frustration over hiding his powers, and his covering his tracks when he had to do something super to save someone.  Lex Luthor, I can now see, how he developed his totally dimented personality.  He shows us that he is not only bad, but will become totally EVIL (The apple doen't fall far from the tree).  This is a great series.
B00000255F|5.0|Born to Run is not his greatest album (that description should be reserved for &quot;The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle&quot;), but it's definitely where we see Bruce's poetry at its peak. Starting with the amazing &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, the album charts his departure from the small towns in New Jerset to seek a larger audience in New York City.<br />The album is amazing. Thunder Road is an absolute classic. That song might be his best-written work. &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot; takes him into the city where he puts together his band. &quot;Night&quot; is amazing - every working man's anthem. I must say I'm not a fan of &quot;Backstreets&quot;, but &quot;Born to Run&quot; was almost literally an anthem. Then, to close, &quot;Meeting Across The River&quot; serves as a metaphoric gathering of resources to prove his hometown detractors wrong. And finally, &quot;Jungleland&quot; takes the daunting task of taking over the NYC music scene by the short hairs and cements Bruce's standing as the king of music.<br />Can you tell I like Bruce Springsteen? I grew up with this music, but didn't buy my first Springsteen album until December 2003 at age 32. The music and poetry is staggeringly heart-felt, and this particular album makes the best use of Springsteen's empathetic narrative skills and shows his fans who's Boss.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I am more of a Batman kind of person and felt it was going to be tough to top those movies until Spiderman came along. I had high hopes on it, but the film just didn't seem to mesh well. It would take a light tone but then at the end it takes such a dark turn which doesn't make the film work well with the different drastic tones in one film. While the acting was good and story decent, the story should have been dark the whole way through which is what makes good superhero movies. <BR>Overall, the film is decent, but didn't fulfill my expectations for it.
B000066C1N|4.0|Being a huge Bryan Adams fan since mid 80s, I have mixed feelings on this masterpiece soundtrack in 2002 featuring Canne winning title track HERE I AM. How I rejoiced when I found Bryan name on Billboard when this album came out. And I am glad to encounter great composer Hans Zimmer. I WILL ALWAYS RETURN is Bryan's best style of ballad which is used in two more versions in this album, and GET OFF MY BACK ,classic style uptempo rocker ,is my #1 favorite. It is good for Bryan Adams fans since 90s who love his ballad movie hits but for me it is a bit of frustrating because I still reminisce &quot;The Summer of 69&quot; Bryan. I bet he will return with his uptempo rockers that &quot;Bang The Roof&quot;. Rick Springfield just did that in recent album why not Bryan?<br />Recommended for Bryan Adams, Hans Zimmer fans and soundtrack collectors.
B00006AW2S|5.0|With the inclusion of (I Can' Get No) Satisfaction, this CD, LP, must be considered at least one outstanding recording.<BR>There was a London\DECCA previous release in wonderful original mono.  The CD 820 049-2 'Made In Hanover, West Germany' has the exact same as the U.S. 'abkco' silver CD tracks, but the original &quot;mono&quot; really puts all the 2002 'remasters' to shame.<BR>At least the first 4 U.K. Rolling Stones LP albums were in mono.<BR>It seems that U.K. DECCA finally got it right with the late 65-66<BR>LP 'after-Math' now available again through abkco/DECCA/London.<BR>&quot;NOW&quot; has many originally mono tracks recorded at 2120 South Michigan Avenue (CHESS studios), also a Nanker-Pheldge track on the Germany only LP &quot;Around And Around&quot;, only released as an EP in the U.K., so it's good, but it's a faked-recompiled non-U.K. LP.  Also, the abkco/London 12 track LP &quot;Got Live If You Want It! is also fake.  The original mono EP DFE-8620 is the genuine EP.  As is the music business, &quot;It's Only Rock 'N ' Roll!&quot;
B00005Q4GA|2.0|Tomb Raider the movie failed to be hardly anything like Tomb Raider the video game. Lara Croft in the video game is dressed in brown and green clothes, Lara Croft in the movie is dressed in all black. <br />Also, in the video game, she's just about always in tombs. In the movie, she hardly ever was in any tombs, and that movement of manuvers she did at the beggining of the movie in the tomb to make it seem as if it's the video game come to life expect for her black clothes, that was quickly over after only a few minutes and it was only in her backyard in her mansion where she practices.<br />She is a very sexy woman, though. (...)<br />Angelina Jolie's sexieness was the only good thing about Tomb Raider the movie, and again, if they were trying to make it as resembling to the video game as possible, then like that older movie Super Mario Bros., they didn't do so good.
B0001Z363W|3.0|For me, this album was quite disappointing.  I bought it knowing that it was supposed to be a little bit mellower, but bearing the BLS name, i figured it would still be a heavy album.  Wrong.  I can't take anything away from Zakk as being an extremely talented musician today, but i agree with a previous review in that he shouldn't have called this Black Lable Society, because it's just not as heavy as the other BLS albums.  And another thing that really blew me away was the piano ballads.  You can't put two skulls on the cover of a cd with more than one piano ballad, lol.  Once again, this shows how incredibly talented Zakk Wylde really is, but it's just wrong to call it Black Label Society.  I believe a more appropriate title for the cd would be  Zakk Wylde-Not so Wylde.  If you dig heavier acoustic music, this is for you, otherwise, look elsewhere for his heavy stuff.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is superb.<BR>There is not one song on here I dislike.<BR>The album is overrated, but is still amazing.<BR>Stop crticizing this album and comparing them to huge bands and bands that no ones ever heard of. <BR>I'm not posting this to glorify the album, because the album does that itself.<BR>Overall, this album is amazing. Borrow it from someone. Buy it. Whatever. Just LISTEN TO IT. We all have our own tastes, but atleast one song should apeal to you. You don't have to like it, but to say it is terrible/drek is completely false.<BR>~<BR>One person was comparing Kurt and John Lennon and saying that Kurt had terrible lyrics. John Lennon is AMAZING and a great lyricist. Kurt and John were compared because of their amazing lyrics and impact on their generation. As a HUGE Beatles fan, its hard for me to critisize them. Sadly, some of their lyrics arent genius either. &quot;One and One and One is three&quot; - Come Together. &quot;When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide&quot; - Helter Skelter. &quot;I am he As you are he As you are me And we are all together&quot; - I Am the Walrus. &quot;If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat,<BR>If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat,If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet&quot; - Taxman.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Lots of action and drama held together by an intresting idea. The subtitles are well translated but the extras are meaningless (no translation). <br />If you like watching kids kill eachother (doesn't everyone) then just drop this in your shopping cart. It is far out and cool. (It seems that there are plenty of people selling it new if amazon doesn't restock it, so it isn't hard to get).
B00005JLKB|5.0|The title says it all.  I don't really need to say anything else.  I've been an avid fan of Smallville ever since it came out a couple years ago.  I still remember the first time I saw the commercial for it.  It was in a movie theater, but I forget what movie I was seeing at the time.  See, it's that good! LOL  Anyway, I've tried not to miss any episodes, but I know I've missed one here or there.  I was actually able to see an episode I never saw before after I bought this 1st season.  And here I thought I never missed an episode in the 1st season.  I can't wait till I get the 2nd season which is released on May 18.  I already pre-ordered it.  One more thing, I think the guy they picked to play Lex Luthor is perfect for the part.  I love his character, but I am a guy, so I don't like him that way. LOL  Also, the actress who plays Lana is HOT, and the one who plays Chloe is pretty cute.  All in all they have an awesome storyline, and it's a good wholesome family show.  The only thing I'm sad about is he hasn't been able to learn how to fly, and he hasn't created his suit yet, but the great stories they have more than make up for it.  I give Smallville an A+++++!
B00009V7RF|4.0|I've always been a fan of the BEP, but would be the first to admit that they're not the greatest rap group.  For years they've tried to stay away from quote &quot;pop artist&quot; status remain true hip hop heads.  However bills gotta be paid and screaming how more hip hop you are then the next act does get pretty old.  I believe they've finally found their place in todays music.  Plus the including of Fergie to the group was a needed addition.  Shut Up is a hot song, and she's the reason for it.  All in all not one of the best hip hop albums I've heard but I feel it's a good one to listen to none the less
B00009ATKS|5.0|--who'd buy it?--so I guess the next best thing's Happy Music for Happy People.  That way, at least, you might, serendipitously, hook all the--probably not inconsequential--optimists out there.<br />Dreamy, gorgeous soundscapes for the unfolding apocalypse.<br />Does it lack res?  Of course.  But so what?  It's MERELY ravishingly, stultifyingly dazzling.  What more do you want in these days of untethered postmodernism?<br />A master narrative?<br />Look elsewhere.
B000067J1H|5.0|This is my favorite movie. When I first saw the advertisements for this movie, I figured it was a stupid boxing movie (not to mention that I think Brad Pitt is way over-rated) so I didn't go to see it at the cinema. A couple of years later, I was up late at night and had nothing to do, so I watched it on HBO(or one of those similar channels). I'd forgotten the ads so I had no expectations. I just watched it unfold, seemingly leading nowhere in the first half hour. I've never enjoyed a non-adrenaline movie as much as I did this one. Edward Norton's performance is wonderful. The scene called &quot;Jack's Smirking Revenge&quot; on the dvd, is by itself worthy of an Oscar. Norton is believable in every second of the movie. The story is also brilliant. I read the book a while later and loved it, although I think I would be less pleased with the movie if I'd read the book first. Then I read Chuck Palahniuk's other novels. The man is a genius. Survivor, my absolute favorite novel of all time, is satire at its best. Oh yeah, the quality of the dvd is very good too.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|One word, stunning. Like the film, the score for THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is gripping and beautiful. John Debney successfully blends Middle-Eastern and Occidental musical styles to create a film score that is rich in depth and diversity. It accurately conveys the film's sorrow and beauty in a such a way as to leave one begging for more. Inserting Middle-Eastern instruments (and at points actual melodies) into the fabric of the music gave an authentic glimpse into the time and setting of the film. Immediately after seeing the film, I realized that a new height had been reached in the art of giving a film its musical soul.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Strange how Quentin's superb film-play style has improved, but the substance and dialogue he's known for has degraded. This is a classic case of style over substance, and I truly think even the biggest fans of this movie will first talk about how great the scenes looked and how the camera work was dashing. No one can doubt this movie has pinache! But when it comes to interesting plot and well-written dialogue, this movie comes up short. Seems there's a big &quot;hate it or love it&quot; thing going on with this film. But I didn't hate it, but I surely didn't love it. I'm giving it 3 stars because at first I was genuinely interested in what was happening, and I really DID love the style and variations in visuals. But when the movie was about half over, I realized we weren't going to get any more depth, and the movie turned into just one big mess of fights after fights. And I thought the &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot; fights were boring! Once Uma confronted another enemy, I groaned: &quot;Not again!&quot; Fight, punch, kick, slice, move and swirl, exaggerated blood gushing, and...repeat! Well, glad I watched it, and I'll watch the 2nd Volume (I hear it's better), but it's not good enough to watch again.
1400031524|2.0|Henning Mankell is the author of a number of police procedurals set in Sweden with a hero called Inspector Kurt Wallender. Most of the books are slow moving with most of the interest arising from the sub plots related to Wallenders life. Generally unexciting stuff, his conflicts with his irritating father, and the general problems and anxieties of a middle aged man. The strength of the books is the sense of their Swedishness and the realism of police matters.<br />This book is odd in that instead of the usual rather dull plot the hero heads of to Latvia, enters the country illegally on a false passport, steals car, assaults the local Lativian police, falls for a local damsel in distress and we have the plot elements which would normally be associated with an American film starring Tom Cruise. In the rest of the books the most action one would expect is for Wallender to be slightly overcharged for some herrings.<br />The feeling after reading the book is rather like buying the New York Review of Books and finding that it has suddenly got pictures of page three girls from one of Rupert Murchoch's publications through it. Quite disconcerting. <br />Never the less like any mystery thriller, one is looking at entertainment rather than emerging with a new vision of the world so that such things matter not. Still probably not as good as his other books which one reads with a sort of solid comfort.
B00005JMEW|4.0|As many know, Quentin Tarantino's lovingly crafted \\"Kill Bill\\" was originally filmed as a single movie.  This review deals with its first half, volume one of two.<br />The movie starts off with a blast...  a gunshot to Uma Thuman's head, to be precise.  Tarantino doesn't waste any time in showing you that this movie is going to be grossly gory, but fortunately, this first shot is the most realistic depiction of violence and gore within the entirety of this first volume.<br />As the credits roll, we're treated to Tarantino's as-always stellar ability to match music with a film--\\"Bang bang, my baby shot me down\\" plays over the opening credits.  This excellent taste in music pervades the entire film, and every selection works alongside the visuals on the screen to give a very specific impression.<br />For, evident as always, Tarantino knows exactly what he's doing when crafting visual and aural sensations within his films.  He's masterful director when it comes to this, and \\"Kill Bill\\" shows this off remarkably, its looser reality, roving story, and larger budget giving Tarantino the freedom to really wow us with some great visuals.<br />Many have stated that this movie is an elaborate homage to Tarantino's old grindhouse loves, and this is so.  The very style of the film reeks with it, and this isn't a bad thing--it gives the movie a very fresh atmosphere, apperance, and feel and only serves to enhance the story.<br />Unfortunately, the dialogue in \\"Kill Bill\\", while competent, doesn't even approach the mastery of Tarantino's previous pictures.  But the movie doesn't rest on this as much as, say, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" did, so it's not a serious flaw in this case.<br />The film climaxes with a huge fight scene, so long and over-the-top gory that you're numb by its conclusion.  Nevertheless, Tarantino did an excellent job of directing the action.<br />\\"Kill Bill\\" is a thrill ride from start to finish, and while it shows the same artistic love of filth that Tarantino has alwayswallowed in, it's well worth the time of a less than squeamish viewer.  Action fans, those who love the films Tarantino did, or those who simply love *his* films would all get loads of enjoyment from this picture.<br />The DVD itself is sparse, though its featurette on the making of the movie is interesting and entertaining.  For casual viewers, this edition is probably a rental, but die-hard Tarantino fans should definitely pick this up.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is by far the best action movie of all time. The plot is a bride (Uma Thurman) is shot in the head at her wedding in a small chapel in El Paso, Texas. The bride was pregnant at the time. She wakes up from a four year coma and wants revenge. She has a kill list and has 5 people on it the last being Bill. This movie is great and i can not wait to see the sequel. I praise this movie and recommend it very highly. Not only does Uma Thurman have a great performance but so does Lucy Liu who plays the leader of a underworld gang from Tokyo. Although this movie is excellent it is very gory and sometimes disgusting so close your eyes when they happen (especially the Buck part). I promise If you watch this youll want to see the next one. This is one fight she didnt start but is determined to finish!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|this album has not left my cd player since i bought it!!! i was lucky enough to see gavin degraw perform live in san francisco and i cannot say enough about how talented he is and how his music makes me feel.  i recommend this album to everyone!!!!
0618526412|5.0|I bought this book in first edition when I worked at Houghton Mifflin 25 years ago because I totally fell in love with it.  The characters are as rich as any who have ever been imagined, and the story is just breathtaking.  I hope the new-found success of this book will also drag along Carson McCullers' other masterpiece, &quot;The Member of the Wedding,&quot; which has had such an impact in my own life.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The best movie I've seen in a long time. I understand why the average american Joe would not find it as good as others would. It had to do mainly with the fact this movie wasn't targeted for the typical hollywoodian audience.  It covers a human dimension that doesn't necessarily exist in a north american civilisation accustomed to cliches and lacking true travel experience. Actually one would probably have to have lived abroad to understand this movie and the characters, as well as the whole atmosphere that being in Tokyo brings to the picture. But it's defnitely not necessary, provided one has an imagination.<br />  For my part I have lived in Japan for 7 years, 6months of which in Tokyo, and to my surprise, the first dance club they visited in the film was also the first one I was invited too.. very funky place with funky people. Good choice on Coppola!<br />   The choices of actors is excellent and Scarlett definitely shines and makes one nostalgic of those days in Tokyo.  As for Bill Murray, he is the perfect choice to play the role of a family man bored in Tokyo, but experiencing something entirely new and refreshing. He doesn't bring with him the pretence that Japan is a stupid place, even though like most new foreigners in Japan would, he enjoys goofing around with the people.<br />  All in all, a refeshing and long overdue movie dealing with Japan, with true to life situations and characters.  The only thing missing are the japanese women, but then again, who would care in the presence of the lovely and sexy Scarlett.
630289915X|5.0|This uplifting film directed by Frank Capra was released in 1947; still being watched years later, It's a Wonderful Life is a true classic.  Starring James Stewart and Donna Reed it was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  The message this story portrays is timeless; not only that no one is poor who has friends, but also that you reap what you sow.  When George Bailey (Stewart) was a young man he was driven by his dreams and desires to explore the world and build great things.  Unfortunately, George's dreams were repeatedly put on hold by his sense of obligation to his deceased father, the struggling family business, and his friends in Bedford Falls.  After years of living in the small town that he always longed to escape and doing a job he never really wanted, impending bankruptcy causes George to hit an all time low.  Contemplating suicide, it takes a guardian angel to make him see all the good things that he accomplished in his life and how many lives around him that he touched beginning when he was just a boy.  James Stewart gives an emotional performance; whether he is praising his father's morals and decency as a human being, praying to God for guidance, or celebrating his new outlook on life the viewer can relate to his passion, desperation, or joy.  Throughout his life George Bailey sowed and nurtured many friendships and in the end he reaped the rewards of each and every one.  I give it five stars.
B00005JMKI|5.0|I finally got the opportunity to see \\"Dogville\\" today. I have been wanting to see it for some time now. I am not really a big Nicole Kidman fan but I do think she is a good actress to say the very least. I just never been really into some of her films (didn't like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" but loved \\"The Others\\", \\"Dead Calm\\", \\"The Hours\\"). I can now add \\"Dogville\\" to my brief list of films that I enjoyed her in. \\"Dogville\\" simply took my breath away. This was a film that solely relied on the actors and their performances than on the settings and scenery. Director Lars Von Trier picked a stunning cast of actors to play the entire town of Dogville. It took me awhile to recognize Patricia Clarkson (of \\"The Station Agent\\") as Vera, the wife of the local apple orchard man. The story revolves around Dogville and its residents when Grace (Nicole Kidman) enters the town and is befriended by Tom (Paul Bettany). The residents are at first reluctant to allow Grace to reside in their small, desolate town but eventually they decide to give her two weeks to prove herself. Everything starts off on the right foot for Grace but eventually the towns people begins to show their true colors when missing/wanted posters of Grace are hung up, and it isn't a pretty sight. Despite the lengthiness of the film, I was engaged in the film completely. This was my first Lars Von Trier film I have seen so I can't really compare \\"Dogville\\" to any of his other movies. If I thought \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"21 Grams\\" were dark films, \\"Dogville\\" would make them look like an Adam Sandler movie. I thought \\"Dogville\\" was a very compelling look into the dark side of human nature and how manipulative and cruel we as an entire race can be towards our fellow human being. I also liked the feel of the film. It felt like watching a play in a movie theater. In some bizarre way, \\"Dogville\\" was a messed up version of \\"Our Town\\". Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, and the rest of the cast put in excellent performances. I loved \\"Dogville\\" despite how dark the mood got.despite how dark the mood got.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion's &quot;Falling Into You&quot; was one of the first CD's that I've ever owned back in the year of 1996, and it is still one the best and first CD's that I've ever owned, today! Each song on this fantastic album is beautifully sung by the wonderful Celine Dion, and what more can I say about it? It's just absolutely fantastic and spectacular! I can't believe that this was actually an album that I started off with and I'm so glad to have done so! This was the CD that started it all for me, and each and every song on this splendid album is magnificent!
0920668364|5.0|I have to wonder how the detractors of this book can turn such a sweet, simple story of a mother's unconditional love into something so [misinterpreting].  Perhaps they were never loved the way the son and baby in this book are.<br />I've been reading this book to my kids since they were babies and even now at the ages of eight and six they still choose it occasionally.  My daughter is especially fond of it.  They have not been \\"psychologically scarred\\" by the story, as some reviewers have suggested would happen.  Instead my children see the story for exactly what it is: a beautiful portrayal of parental love passed down from generation to generation.<br />I recommend this book to all parents and children who are able to feel love.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After viewing so many different styles of sci-fi shows, this one takes the slice of cake in being completly different.  Who knew that the western style would end up moving from earth, to outer space and still thrive the young and old alike.  I would have to recommend this movie to all alike, because in a way everyone has one type of personality trait from each of the characters.
B000002WPI|5.0|They dont make it like this anymore . This went through stories of struggle . Hip Hop tells a story and this tells the truth about so much in life when you live in a very tough area . being from where these guys are from , makes it all sureal. its worth to buy . i ofcourse did when i was much younger , bought it when it came out .
B000002NC4|5.0|I heard Velvet Waltz and it was probably the most amazing thing I'd ever heard. I haven't even got the album (yet) but from what I've read the rest is just as good. Buy this just for Velvet Waltz. What a song.
B000001DVD|5.0|This is without a doubt def leppards finest album , if you are  are true 8o's fan of the hair band glam type rockers, minus the glamour, these guys were hungry , and they kicked it out. Right from the heart rock..
B00009P1O0|5.0|Neil vents his anger on this one-anger at the music industry, fans, the movie industry, himself, and all the senseless drug deaths of his friends.  It's barely produced, in fact it almost has the sound of a live recording-ragged and rough playing and singing.  The lyrics are excellent, and convey a sense of anger and an urgency to let it all out.  This is not party music, folks.  It's for late nights alone, when you need a soul cleansing.  Oddly enough, there is almost a sense of relief, and maybe even hopefullness by the time you get to the end.  Despite all the angry and dark lyrics, there is a complete lack of bitterness, and a feeling that he said what he had to say in song, and can now move on.  A MUST for all of Neil Young fans, and anyone who appreciates well written lyrics.  Highly Recommended!

0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic England, centering around a teenage gang.  Their leader, Alex, is our narrator, as he lets us join in on the gang's adventures, which mostly center around &quot;ultraviolence&quot; such as rape, beatings, very sick jokes where someone ends up severly damaged, etc.  On one of these outings they make their way into a middle-aged woman's house and Alex ends up killing her and is caught by police.  If I say anymore I will give away the book, so I will stop now.<br />This is definitly my favorite book ever.  I read it for the first time while at Camden Military Academy.  It was the original American edition, plain orange cover, no special design, only 20 chapters (the American publisher didn't seem to really like it, telling Burgess he should be lucky to have even 20).  It was a torn, forgotten book lying beneath one of the shelves at the school's library.  Burgess, as usual, plays around with language in this book, creating the &quot;Nadsat&quot; language, a combination of German and something else, which is the slang language of teens and the lower class in the times of the future in England.<br />This book also, I think, satires government control, because they &quot;reform&quot; Alex in some sick way, but if I explain it I will give it away...<br />I truly reccommend this book to anyone that likes to think, and isn't offended by horrible violence taking place while someone sings &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot;<br />This was a hard review to write... you just have to read the book to get it.
B000002TQV|5.0|I've been going in the opposite direction with Radiohead's albums, going from the newest on backward, but this album truly exceeded my expectations.  You seriously can't go wrong with this album, it's great.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|I got this CD few days ago and I just cannot stop listening to it. It's overwhealming! Fantastic oriental atmosphere (melodies, choirs) fantastic concept, fantastic lyrics. The emotions are so authentic. This CD is an unique expirience. 8 years of waiting definitely paid off. The first pressing comes with the bonus disc with their unplugged show. It's the icing on the cake. If you're familiar with Orphaned Land's old stuff, you just cannot afford not to have it.<br />I've been listening to metal for 15 years, I've listened to more than 2500 albums. I'm very critical toward everything I hear, but this one left me speachless. Not just me, but all of my friends, too. After just 3 listenings I was absolutely certain that this album will be one of the few of my all time favorites. Words of praise!<br />JUST GET IT!
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvanas last album , was no surprise. A reserved classic. But It is so much more darker and must I say a little scarier than &quot;Nevermind&quot;, nevertheless, the lyrics are so well done and the vocals are shocking and painful (in a good way!), I swear &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; is on &quot;Nevermind&quot;!!!. Also There is a bonus track, which is by far the scariest so far, hearing him laugh and talking randomly like &quot;You should be the one responsible for&quot; scrwaming then going in to a low talk. Its pretty freaky!. &quot;Heart shaped-box&quot; is amazing!. &quot;Frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle&quot; rocks too, and the over 1 min 20 song &quot;Tourettes&quot; is amazing, just really good and the little thing he sez at the start of it gets me everytime too, &quot;Moderate rock&quot;&quot; LOL<br />Overall &quot;In Utero&quot; is a much darker scarier album. With painful lyrics and I have just found out the last track which is uncredited here or not releasedin the U.S is  7.30 long!.<br />So yes. A very painful album, and very scary to think this was months before he did what he did.<br />In Utero = Classicly Dark
0618526412|5.0|Jesse Wright, amateur reviewer<BR>I can totally understand why this is an 'Oprah Pick'. It is a magnificent piece of work, masterfully written (though it was originally published in the '40's). I applaud this pick as a hard to put down wonderfully written book.<BR>It is a wonderful memoir and very memorable in the prolific pages. I rank it up there with \\"Nightmares Echo\\", \\"Running With Scissors\\" and \\"A Child Called It\\" for it's integrity to the story. <BR>Thank you Oprah!!
B000003TA4|5.0|Ive only got 3 words,&quot;Damn Classic Album&quot;.<br />ALSO, Kurts vocals are painfully amazing, and the lyrics are amazing.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is an amazing action movie set on the high seas, and I especially mean high when they are rounding cape horn.  I had watched the movie through once and felt I had missed a lot because much of the dialog seemed gibberish.  I immediately watched it a second time with closed captioning on and it helped a lot.<br />This movie has humor action and a certain reality of sea warfare.  Imagine a 12 year old officer, son of a lord commanding a group of low born navel sailor.  If you had a hard time imagining Luke Skywalker leading Rogue Squadron at age 16 and Princess Leia leading the rebels at age 19, how about age 12.  This was the royal navy in 1805.  A 16 year old was a third Lt. ranking high enough to join the officers mess and lead men into a battle.  And the navy men followed.<br />The movie is PG13 but the violence was not gory.  There is no nudity or cursing that we recall so we judge this movie to be family friendly.  More evidence that a director can make a great movie with a superior script, great acting and outstanding cinematography and special effects.  The opening battle with the sound of projectiles flying by makes you feel you are right there.. Makes you want to duck down.<br />Russell Crowe is incredible as the extremely bright, creative naval tactician and captian of the HMS Surprise who leads his men with a positive, confident swagger.  The men have nicknamed him Lucky Jack Aubrey.<br />So many things make this an outstanding movie that I must give it a, rare for me, 5 star rating.  The one annoyance of the unclear dialog, actually helps the viewer feel like they are in 1805 British times.
B00003CX95|4.0|viewer from England.  Sure, this movie may not be based on fact.  In fact, it may have very little in common with the true history of England and Scotland.  But let's just be honest here.  England has to take its share of responsibility for many years of rape, murder, burning and the spreading of terror.  You don't gain power over a great deal of the world by being peaceable and friendly.  Just ask India.<br />If you don't like this film because it depicts the English as the bad guys.  I don't have a problem with that.  But, let's face it, the English weren't saints.  No people are.  Every side usually has committed some unspeakable act or another.  <br />I myself enjoyed this film not because the Scots stuck it to the English.  I enjoyed this film because it's a fairytale.  One man with great honor standing up to an unfair and brutal ruler.  And though he didn't win the war, he had the courage to fight for his convictions and his people.  Forget the nationalities involved.  It's a story almost any downtrodden people can relate to and love.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What can I say... This is an over-the-top piece of cinema that is so much fun to watch!<br />Very well cast and directed.  The sets, lighting, camera work, and editing are all top notch and keep the story moving at a breakneck pace, in a very entertaining fashion.<br />What a great way to bring the musical back to the forefront!
B0000028M7|5.0|The early 90's was a great time for music, no matter what type of music you were into; If you liked hip hop, you had Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube. If you liked R&amp;B you had Mary J. Blige, Jodeci and R. Kelly. If you liked hard rock and metal, you have Metallica, Pantera, Faith No More,the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Megadeth and Anthrax to name a few, But they are all dwarfed by the beautiful new style of rock knows as &quot;grunge&quot;. And all of those bands had their own niche about them; Nirvana was about angst and alienation, Pearl Jam was the socially conscious ones, Stone Temple Pilots was the performance art band and Soundgarden was the beligerent version of Led Zeppelin. But of all of the prominent bands to come out of that era, nobody really harnessed their potental and abilities, in my opinion, than Alice In Chains. Many bands have taken on Black Sabbath's dark undertone, but few have harnessed itand made it beliveable like AIC did. It all starts with Layne Staley(R.I.P), who's vocals sould like a mixture of gospel wailing and gothic chants;he's no Chris Cornell, but he's certanly no amateur. But Mr. Staley's voice would be a tree falling into the forest without the fabulous rhythm section he was blessed to team up with. Guitarist Jerry Cantrell takes from Kirk Hammett as he does Tommy Iommi; though he's not as breathtaking as Kirk or innovative as say, Tom Morello or Dimebag Darrell, the lead parts are amazing. Staley and Cantrell are an intresting pair; no bands of recent memory have used harmony as they've used melody; you might call them the Lennon and McCartney of grunge. Bassist Mike Inez,<BR>always said, was the second best bass player of the 90's , right behind Flea(Flea's my boy!) and one over Jason Newsted(Metallica's gonna miss him). Drummer Sean Kinney is<BR>also great, though he's no Chad Smith or Vinnie Paul. They balance each other out perfectly, which is evident on &quot;Dirt&quot;. It starts with the somewhat playful &quot;Them Bones&quot;, and takes a more serious tone with &quot;Down In A Hole&quot;(which could have well been a gospel or R&amp;B song), &quot;Rain When I Die&quot;, &quot;Junkhead&quot;, &quot;Damn That River&quot; and &quot;Sickman&quot;. There's &quot;Rooster&quot;, which is a recounting of Jerry Cantrell's father's tour of duty in Vietnam; it ranks with Black Sabbath's &quot;War Pigs&quot;, Guns N'Roses&quot; Civil War&quot; and Metallica's &quot;One&quot; with songs dealing with that subject. &quot;Angry Chair&quot; and &quot;Godsmack&quot;(which created a second rate band of the same name, as you know) serve as the warmup for my favorite song...<BR>&quot;Would&quot;, which was on the soundtrack for the the movie &quot;Singles&quot;(mediocre movie,KILLER soundtrack) is one of my favorite songs of ANY musical genre; while Guns N'Roses &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; is best album opener in recent rock history, &quot;Would&quot; is the best album closer. &quot;Dirt&quot; is the ultimate creative testament to a band at its peak, and that should still be making music today. Get up a big ol' pile of them bones!
006092988X|5.0|How I wish I could have been a child like Francie Nolan!  Yes, her family was poor and grief striken, but she enjoyed every day of her life!  She made the good times seem magnificent and had a wonderful way of perceiving the bad times!  The simpleness of her eating jello with whipped topping for the first time and the way she described that experience brought me to tears!  How she craved education and new experiences!  I hope from now on that when I encounter a new day that I look upon them the way Francie did!  I believe that everyone experiences this book differently and that's what makes it such a jewel of literature!
B00003CXPJ|1.0|this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen save you maoney and rent or buy something better. ben stillers worst movie. its hard to really say how bad it is
B0001Z53CY|3.0|I find myself just listening for the verses featuring the lead singer of their 'Band', but it is still a good effort on d12's part.  Buy if u r a fan of Shady/Aftermath.  Anyway, I give it my support.  Oh yeah, check out the track 'Bitch', it's tight.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Diane Keaton is one of the best actors working.  She's very much a throwback to Hollywood's Golden Era, in that her style and look and talent are her own.  She's sort of a Katharine Hepburn/Claudette Colbert mix -- sweet, funny, and very much her own woman.  I had the honor, when I lived in Los Angeles, of running into her at Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard, and she's also a very nice, gracious lady.<br />She was the main reason I saw \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" -- although I am a Jack Nicholson fan, as well -- and is the main reason I gave the film 4 stars here.  Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry, a successful Broadway playwright who seemingly has it all:  wealth, beauty, career success, a charming home in the country, and a beautiful daughter named Marin (Amanda Peet).  She's even managed to maintain a decent working relationship with her ex-husband (welcome back Paul Michael Glaser!), a director who works with her on her plays.<br />In fact, the one thing Erica doesn't seem to have is a man.  And she's okay with this, until a getaway to the country with her sister Zoe (the under-utilized Frances McDormand) finds Erica sharing her beach house with her daughter Marin -- and Marin's new boyfriend, 63-year-old music mogul Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson).  When Harry has a mild heart attack and has to recuperate at the beach house, he sets about making Erica NUTS with his attitudes about women (he only dates young ones -- ONLY), and in general disrupts her peaceful, bland existence when she finds herself attracted to him, as well.  <br />Add to this the fact that Harry's doctor (played by the bland-as-butter Keanu Reeves, who's supposed to be 36 years old here - ??) has the super-mega-hots for Erica, having seen all her plays, and you have the beginnings of a romantic triangle that (on some levels) is kind of hard to believe, yet somehow works.<br />The performances in this film are good all the way 'round, with Keaton and Nicholson standing out, and it's FANTASTIC to see a romantic comedy that features main players who are middle-aged, instead of Hollywood's usual demographic of having characters only in their 20's or 30's.  Whenever Keaton and Nicholson are together on the screen the movie is DYNAMITE -- these two have great chemistry -- and even Amanda Peet holds her own well in her scenes with each of the stars (especially Nicholson).<br />I just feel the movie sort of faded out in its second half.  Keanu Reeves got on my nerves; that whole younger-man subplot would have been MUCH more believable with a better actor in the role.  And though Keaton's \\"sobbing\\" was a bit much for me after awhile, I understood it; unlike another reviewer here who blasted it as unreal after her charater only went through a \\"one-night stand,\\" I understood that Eric didn't see it as a one-night stand -- and Harry had been living in her home for over a week when it happened, so it was NOT a one-night stand, just sex that happened only one time between two people who had come to know each other a little.  <br />The ending was a bit too cutesy, but overall I loved the movie, just for the performances.  Somehow, I wish Frances McDormand had been given more to do -- and Keanu Reeves less to do -- but the film was a very real look at the age-old curiosity that older men dating young women is okay ... while older women dating young men is still seen as a bit more \\"dirty\\" --<BR>and it's played with class by all, particularly Keaton and Nicholson, who need to do another film together; their chemistry is THAT strong.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesday's With Morrie was an excellent book.  It was an easy read even for those people who might be considered reluctant readers.  Mitch Albom is an excellent author, and he did a wonderful job telling this story.  He does a terrific job keeping the reader at the edge of their seat and making you want to turn the pages.   When you are reading Tuesday's With Morrie you feel like you have become one of the many people in the book who grow attached to this man, Morrie who is suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).  After I was through reading this book I recommended it to everyone.  When I returned the book, my local librarian told me she had several people on a waiting list for a copy of Tuesday's With Morrie.  Again, I would recommend this book to even the most reluctant reader.  It will touch your heart just as it did mine.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I missed &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; in theaters because in some ways it just didn't interest me.  I wasn't a particular fan of anyone in the cast, nor of Tarantino the director (though, as an actor, I thought he was one of the best things about &quot;From Dusk to Dawn&quot;).  By the time the DVD came out, I was curious about all the hype, and had made 2 new friends who were absolutely nuts about the movie.  They brought it over for me to see.<br />It now ranks as one of my favorite films ever - and, along with &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 2&quot; (which I saw the day it was released), is not so much a movie as an &quot;experience&quot; that I can't forget --<br />I am a Tarantino Turnaround - now a HUGE fan.<br />Uma Thurman (who I am now also a huge fan of) plays The Bride, basically a hired assassin formerly known as Black Mamba who decides to leave her gang of hired killers and get married, after discovering she's pregnant.  Bill, the leader of the gang, has other ideas ... and in a dusty wedding chapel in the deserts of El Paso, Bill and his little band of murderers simply walk in on the wedding rehearsal, and shoot everyone dead ... eight corpses plus The Bride, who Bill finishes off himself with a bullet to the head.<br />And that's only the beginning!  Four years later, The Bride wakes up from a coma; she's survived the slaughter!  But there's no baby, no life -- and no mercy.  She decides to exact a huge and bloody revenge on all members of the gang -- ending with Bill, whom she is most determined to kill.<br />The movie is briliant eye-candy, also a great tribute to martial arts films, of the 1970's especially.  The action/fight scenes are impeccably shot -- when The Bride goes up against the Crazy 88 gang, you will NOT move from your seat for even a second -- and even an animated sequence chronicling the backstory of killer O-Ren Ishii is nothing short of phenomenal.  For those nay-sayers who complain of this film being all style over substance, all I can say is 1) what do you expect from a revenge flick? - and 2) when you see part 2, you will see how wrong you are.  <br />One of the most brilliant, bloody, funny, and engrossing films I have ever seen, &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; is Tarantino showing many of his more famous counterparts how a director can make a film so much his own, give it so much his own signature.  I can't explain it, really, but it's just the feel of the movie - with this one, it's NOT a movie, it's more an EXPERIENCE that stays with you a long time; a director's vision so fully realized, it's startling to watch.  Brilliant movie, and if you've seen it and haven't seen the sequel ... you haven't seen the whole story.
B000002IOW|5.0|Lyricism or overarching beauty has rarely been amongst Rush's creative goals and their oeuvre reflects this.  But this album abandons that stricture almost completely.<br />The title track nears splendor.  Listening to it on airplane that was taking off, I was nearly blown away.  Geddy's voice is clear, ringing.  Alex's guitar is shimmering and bright (to borrow a phrase from another Anglo-Saxon band).  The fantastic interweaving of bass and drums is still there.  <br />The polyphony that so marked &quot;Signals,&quot; &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; is backburnered.  While in  now way &quot;add-ons&quot; to the &quot;orginial&quot; music (whatever thatis supposed to mean), the synthesizers are more complementary than integral.  The music would have been just as beautiful if done acoustically.<br />Oddly enough, this was the last tour I went to.  With Alex up on felony charges, we haven't bought tickets this time.  I'm afraid if I do and he's unable to make the shows, the promoters and management will say, hey, &quot;You bought 'em knowing the risk; no refund!&quot;  And here in the Vegas Valley, we have the highest ticket prices in the world! Hopefully, the whole mess'll straigthen out and we'll get to see them.<br />This album represents the last excellent studio efforts on my favorite band's part these last fifteen years.  Obviously Neil's tragedies clearly impacted the band's quality as well as quantity.<br />&quot;Roll the Bones&quot; had a few bright spots, &quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;Test for Echo&quot; were simply forgettable.  Only with &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; has their aesthetic moved closer to something I can identify with--tho' I find the live performances on RIR to be better than the studio versions--still too muddy (the musical flavor of color these last ten years or so)for me, &quot;...Trails&quot; at least shows they've come back to life.  The magnificent &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; should have put any rumors of Rush's demises firmly to rest (at least from creative exhaustion).<br />But the boys have always said they make music for themselves; if no one else likes it, the hell with it.  And that attitude is the reason Rush has, with two and a half exceptions, remained one of the most creative and most popular arena acts in North America.<br />BTW: the reviewer's grammar indicates a Brit.  Apparently, Ms. Williams is unaware of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;  This is the subject that Neil was sp brilliantly satirizing in tje marvelously clear, easily understood &quot;Trees&quot; (one of their many masterpieces).  A case of cultural ignorance we can forgive her for.  (Though we probably shouldn't; everywhere it's been tried racial quotas--the Left's euphemism is &quot;affirmative action&quot; have utterly failed from India to Indiana).<br />But the album is as focused and tight as &quot;Power Windows&quot; and avoids the, at times, meandering musically and lyrically of &quot;Hold Your Fire.&quot;<br />If you're just being introduced to Rush, this would be an excellent work.
B000021YQV|5.0|I love this shhhtuff!!!! They are Queen of this generation...anthem songs...creative and sound humrous at times...mixed with good ole hard core...need 2 buy this folks...
B00008CLOA|5.0|...there's little to nothing any review can add to this legendary release.  Along with Sgt Peppers, Zep 4 &amp; Physical Graffiti, Rush's 2112, the Who's Who's Next, this album represents the pinnacle of a band, indeed, a genre's musical ambition and accomplishment.<br />Produced by Alan Parson's (yes THAT Alan Parson's) the technical precision is simply amazing considering they were working with the most primitive of ANALOG synths (without the financing of Led Zeppelin it should be remembered when thinking of the synthetic strings on &quot;Kashmir&quot;) and sequencers and 8 track recorders.  Technically it is every bit as stunning as Sgt Pepper and Jimmy Page's legendary production work on Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti.<br />This album has been on the charts the longest in history (it passed up Carol King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; when the latter fell off the charts, finally, about ten years ago).<br />Listen to the music and you'll realize why this LP has been on story shelves--thru every format change, if you're old enough you'll recall the horror of 8-tracks and I recall my Dad's joy when he got one of the first car units--for four decades.<br />One word of warning: Don't play &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; too loud.  It's the only track on the album capable of annoying the neighbors.
B000002BFZ|4.0|I think this is just a good ole' rock n' roll record. I am not going to over critique this. I really respect Pearl Jam. Some songs on this album are slower and interesting,and others just plug in and rock. Thats what Pearl Jam were meant to do.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I dare anyone, Superman fan or not, to watch the Pilot episode of Smallville and not want to see more. The Pilot is so well crafted that it sets the rest of the season up for success. The casting, chemistry, writing, and acting are all superb. The entire first season unwraps to put a fresh spin on a story decades old. The tale goes beyond comic book heroes and delves into father/son dynamics and coming of age angst. The first season puts Smallville on the map as one of the best television shows out there.
B00005JMEW|3.0|'Kill Bill' is a difficult film to review.  It has many elements simply copied from other, older genres (martial arts films, westerns), has music from 60's/70's TV shows, and buckets of surrealistic blood (gushing like fountains from amputated limbs/heads).  Inject Tarentino's bizarre sense of humor, and you have one oddball of a movie!<br />Tarentino's penchant for time frame manipulation (ala Pulp Fiction) can make things a little confusing for those not familiar with his approach, but it all comes together if one has patience.  His cinematography is simply superb, especially in the fight sequences, which are the real stars of the film.  The final battle in the Japanese bar is awesome, in spite of the extreme gore.  Tarentino has a way of making dismemberment a humorous event: witness the Lucy Liu 'Yakuza' meeting.<br />I'm not sure I like Tarentino's flippancy toward bloodletting-it's all a sort of cartoon to him.  When one thinks about the real blood being shed in Iraq and Afghanistan (which the US government goes to great lengths to PREVENT the American public from seeing), this stuff feels awfully petty.  Nevertheless, Quentin makes it all seem like no big deal, and creates a near-poetic way to present it to us.  Think about it: if you saw this amount of human devastation on CNN, how would you react?  We snicker because we know it's Tarentino, and 'It's Just a Movie'...
0345350499|3.0|When I started this 800+ page book, I loved it. It captured my imagination and gave me a new perspective of the females in the Arthurian legend. Learning more about Morgaine's childhood and what shaped her was interesting.  Around page 750 or so, it became somewhat of a chore to continue reading though.  While I had to know what became of the characters, it became harder and harder to care, which disappointed me, as I really wanted to LOVE this book.  While I recommend this book as an interesting slant on Arthur, Lancelet, Gwenhwyfar et al...I do so with the caution that it's a long drawn out read.
0679428895|5.0|I picked this up &quot;for an hour&quot; and fininshed at ten thirty at night. Having been to Pompeeii I could just see the action, .<br />For a great summer read, you can't go wrong.
B000002513|5.0|this recording makes me shiver its so good......what a gigantic accomplisment this is.........the strings on New York City....the tuba on circus story....its quite a joy to listen to many many people have asked me what they're listening to when they hear this for the first time....this is Springsteen??????? this is pretty good...even my daughter's punk ass boyfriend has a copy of this ....GIVE IT A LISTEN.....at least once......you gotta be impressed .......seen him a few times and the '75 tour when he did this stuff is etched..i'll never forget that night...remastering would be nice....
B00005JMCW|5.0|Entertaining movie for the entire family. Jamie Lee Curtis was fabulous as the &quot;teenage&quot; mom. Five stars and two thumbs up!<BR>Debbie Farmer, parenting author, 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'
B0000DD7LC|1.0|This is a weak follow up album.  The songs are just not as strong as the first album.
B00005O5CM|5.0|The movie to prove to anyone that blondes, too can be intellegent humans.  Here comes Elle Woods decked out in an all pink outfit with her long glorious blonde hair, president of her uber cool soriority.  She has it all; a 4.0 GPA, a handsome droolworthy boyfriend, and the best friends any girl could have.  One night, she swarms around her soriority estatic, for tonight is the night her boyfriend Warner will propose.  She fantasizes over his proposal, accepting the ring, and dreaming of how the ring will look.<br />She arrives at dinner with Warner, and things don't go as expected.  Warner tells her he needs to find a &quot;more intellegent&quot; women to meet up with his parents standards.  Elle starts panicking in the resteraunt and her mascara drips from her blue eyes as she's faced with the worse nightmare ever!<br />Despite Elle's straight A's and major in Polka Dots, she applies to Harvard, passing a standarized test, and sending in a lengthy video.  She moves to a new area, befriends a manicurist, and tries to find Warner. <br />Shockingly, Warner has found a chick of his own; someone totally opposite of Elle.  Watch the rest of the movie to laugh over Elle and her very brilliant mind at court cases and in classrooms. <br />A truly &quot;Barbie&quot; girl movie.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|if u like d12 u will love this cd bc i think that this is the best cd out this year. i don't care what anyone says this is better then usher's weak a$$ cd conffesions.So that means that this will be number one on the bill board charts next week. so what i am sayin is when this comes out everyone better go and buy this (...).
B00005QW5X|5.0|First of all, thanks to the bloggers at fametracker.com for introducing me to this movie.  It has never been released in NZ (for shame!) and I am so glad I checked it out.  However, it is definitely one of those films you have to watch more than once.  I was at first somewhat mystified by the last 20 mins, but now I find them the most moving and satisfying section of the film.  HEDWIG just gets better and better the more you watch it, and the music is just fantastic.  The DVD is one of the best packages ever - the documentary is fascinating.  A total masterpiece that everyone needs to own.
B00003CXA6|5.0|GETTYSBURG is an EXCELLENT film and a worthwhile use of time and money.  One can sit down with one's family and actually enjoy a film that was made with true morally appropriate goals in mind.  The man that wrote the book, the men who worked to get this film made over a period of 10 years and the re-enactors are worthy of the highest praise for a truly memorable piece of work which United States citizens of today can be proud.  The usual fair from Hollywood makes us ashamed and sickened at the garbage they turn out.  Thankfully, GETTYSBURG is a masterpiece where truth, honor, valor, history, hard work, devotion, bravery, morality and patriotism are shown for the way it really was not as our history books present the history of the War Between the States!
B000002A3T|3.0|Man, i miss the angry floyd of the wall, and final cut, yeah I miss roger.  However that doesn't stop High hopes great day for democracy and Wearing the inside out from shining through.  Those are the three stars, the rest seems a little dull for me, marooned is predictable.  It is nice to hear the boys singing hopefully though.<br />Also the production is weird, reverbed to the point of being muddy.  However if I had to compare the production values to Radio Kaos, I'd go with the reverb over the synthesizers and nonsence, because the reverb doesn't ruin the songs.<br />In my opinion Pros and cons of hitch hiking is better, and so is the majority of Amused to death, but it is better than Radio Kaos and some songs on Amused to death.  Also, when it come to Pink Floyd all &quot;classic&quot; era floyd (1973-1979) is better, and so is meddle.  In my opinion this is a little better than Piper and Saucer full of secrets (damn this album is good though) but better than all else in the catolog.
0446530891|5.0|This is the first novel of David Baldacci's that I have read.  As such, it was surprising captivating.<br />Usually, when a novel says &quot;You won't put it down&quot;, I have little to no problem doing just that.  &quot;Split Second&quot; kept me reading and reading, feeling a need to find just who was behind what I was reading about.<br />It was also refreshing to have a book where the killer isn't revealed right away, and you know all of their motives, etc.  I figured out who, maybe 2/3 of the way through, but still didn't know why, or how it would play out in the end.<br />I will definitely be reading more by Baldacci.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is proper music, this is Pearl Jams second best album after Ten, and although it is kind of spoilt a bit with slightly experimental tracks of guitars and drums that are'nt actually proper songs, it still makes for a fantastic CD. Its better than &quot;Vs&quot; becuase its more straight forward but Vs is an album excellent of course and I spose it is actually just as good as Vitolagy. After this record Pearl Jam started experimenting on their next two CDs, but Binural was when they got back on form &quot;solid album wise&quot;, but I don't like Binural that much. Riot Act (thier latest realease) sounds alot like Vitolagy so get that too!<BR>Great CD with great songs from a great band.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When I was young, I saw Disney's Peter Pan and didn't take with it. I knew I was taking a chance going to see this version but the trailor looked so good I had to at least see it. OH...MY...GOOD! Love at first sight...and nine subsequent times after. The most I've ever seen a movie was 5 times, and that was LOTR:Fellowship. I bleed this movie for all it was worth and am just as eager to see it again as I was the second time. The acting is superb! I usually don't like kids in movies, but the kids in this were wonderful and endearing. Jason Isaacs is the man! This is the first movie I came to recognize him in. He is a brilliant actor. The way he did both Hook and Mr. Darling is to be put among the greats. After seeing this film I went back and saw Disney's Peter Pan. Whole new perspective, whole new respect. (...)
0743455967|5.0|To be honest, Mr. King has been an author I studiously avoided my whole life. I snorted like an elitist when I heard he was working on this book. How can a man who writes so much really CARE about his craft, I wondered.<br />Boy, was I wrong. I have looked at myriads of books about writing and this is, by all odds, the best ever done. A blurb on the back of the book said, &quot;This is the best book on writing. Ever.&quot; <br />I find it hard to disagree with that. King speaks to the reader his enthusiasm and care for the language. He also uses superb examples of writing both positive and negative to wonderful effect.<br />If you desire to write fiction (regardless of genre) then this book should be mandatory. It's clear, fun and highly motivational. If this doesn't make you want to pick up a pen or run to your word processor, then there's something wrong with you!<br />Oh, by the way, this is the first book of Mr. King that I ever read. I intend on reading others.<br />Enjoy.
B00012QM86|5.0|I can't not explain how well this movie was done. Though the horrors of the Holocaust are not something that is taken lightly I can still say that this is one of my favorite movies of all times. The story that this movie tells is not only sad, but very powerful and gives a great account of what people had to go through during the Holocaust. I believe that this movie should be viewed by all high school students in history classes so they can get a semi-real feeling of what people went through during this awful reign of Hitler. I'm glad a DVD version finally came out.
B000002BSV|4.0|You can get a pretty good sense of what this album is like by taking a look at the cover. An anemic shirtless guy, a bored woman whose body seems to be partly made of plasma, and a young man on fire, all lounging on a ratty mattress - yeah, it's something like that.<br />Alternatively, it's loud and feverish with a somewhat tinny quality, first-rate musical decadence with a lot of great chords and choruses, its only fault being an occasional lack of substance. 'Trash' sets the mood perfectly; a very simple lyric carried by the energy of the music and the vocal. 'Film Start' is very stylish, but starts the pattern of songs which don't linger in your mind very long after you've heard them. Although it describes the plight of, well, a film star, it doesn't really give you a sense of a character or situation (&quot;What to believe in when they / change your name, wash your brain, play the game again, yeah yeah yeah&quot;). Compare it to some of Suede's other 'character' songs like 'Animal Nitrate:' (&quot;In your broken home / he broke all your bones / now you're taking it time after time.&quot;) Also, to digress, compare it to Morrissey's much more powerful description of a similiar situation in 'Paint a Vulgar Picture.' Filmstar does sound good, though; ditto for 'Lazy,' 'She' and 'Saturday Night,' all suffering from a similiar disorder. 'The Beuatiful Ones' and 'Picnic by the Motorway' are superior, with greater resonance, and 'The Chemistry Between Us' is so exultant and energetic that a somewhat weak lyric is forgivable.<br />This is all to say nothing of 'By The Sea,' a song so good it deserves a seperate five stars. An oasis of humanity in the middle of this superficial, glammy album, but not quite clashing with the rest of the material, it's heartbreaking. It really might have done better as the closing track.<br />The only real loser is 'Starcrazy,' a song that seems somewhat formulaic and doesn't sound all that good; I usually skip it, even though the title ofthis review was taken from the lyric.
0345448898|5.0|I'd like to dispell the notion that many have in thinking that His Dark Materials are children books. They are not. If anyone under the age of 11 was to read them, not only would the themes be too dark and too anti-Christian, but they probably wouldn't understand much of what is happening.<BR>That said, Philip Pullman has written a wonderful series that I have read three times now. Despite his \\"anti-Christian\\" messages, the story is beautifully and imaginatively written. The first book is the tamest of all three but that doesn't mean there is no controversy. Prepubescent children are in danger from the Church who wants to separate their daemons (physical forms of the people's souls) from their body so as to prevent Dust (a physical representation of Sin) from settling onto their bodies. Through the second book the Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, has started to gather an army to make war on God, or the Authority, and the Church's true side is shown as they try to murder Lyra for being prophesized as the new Eve.<BR>Where in the beginning Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter were seen as the bad, God-hating, side that Lyra was supposed to defeat, she, and the reader, turns so that we are actually rooting for Lord Asriel's war.<BR>The Christian religion is displayed very differently than how churches truly teach it. There isn't any Creator, that is a lie, there is only an angel that came first and named himself the Authority. He has become so old and decrepit that he can't rule for himself and the angel left in control, Metatron, is ready to send angels into everyday human affairs to root out the unfaithful. It would be an Inquisition.<BR>The simple fact that Lyra is an accomplished liar does not prove the story has bad themes, it shows her creativity and her imagination. In fact it saves her life many times, and gets her in trouble at one point that she understands the negative side to lying too much. The books are often compared to Harry Potter and as someone who has read both series there are nearly no similiarities I can see other than the main characters being around the same ages and the themes are fantasy. His Dark Materials have much darker themes and shouldn't be read by the same age group of 9-12, as many sites state the reading age is.<BR>This is a series that I plan to keep for my children should they wish to read it, and I will have no qualms about it
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing when Bill talks to Budd at his trailer, when Budd says &quot;That woman deserves her revenge.&quot; The song isn't on the soundtrack and I don't believe it has been listed under the songs that weren't on it yet. Any help is appreciated.
0060977493|3.0|The God of Small Things could have been a truly great novel, but, like an artist who can't leave a masterpiece alone, Arundhati Roy simply didn't know when to stop.  The characters are vividly drawn, and the language is beautiful.  Roy displays a penchant for descriptive language that is wonderfully arresting, but becomes repetitve and annoying.  The reader gets the picture well before the novel ends, making the last several chapters anticlimactic.  Still, I enjoyed the story of a truly dysfunctional family that suffered the after-effects of British Colonialism and an intractable caste system.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Im a new Nirvana fan, ive always liked their songs i heard on the radio so i picked this up, and it rocks! Nirvana is definately not overrated! With songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Dumb, All Apologies, and the new You Know You're Right, how could Nirvana not be one of the best rock bands ever?
B00005CC9P|5.0|I don't have too much to say except that there is a healthy selection of Priest and Fight classics, as well as a good bit of Halford's newer stuff from.  All in all, it makes for a remarkable mix of Heavy Metal, and over my 100+ CDs, this is easily one of my top ten, and is my #1 Live album.  A common misconception, however, is that Halford did not play any songs from Two on this disc.  &quot;Silent Screams&quot; is actually originally a song he wrote while in Two, and then later remade with his band, Halford.  Two's music before Reznor mixed it was a lot heavier than what you hear on the Voyeurs CD.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|My friend and I were granted by our husbands a night out while they watched the kids. So we went to see this. It is truly one of the better films of 2003. I thought the plot twists and turns were great, and weren't predictable. Ashton did a wonderful job in this movie and was finally able to show that he's not just a comedic actor. If he continues to get rolls like this he could be a top contender of dramatic actors in the future.
B00003BDXG|5.0|One day as i was sitting at home scrolling through ondemand, i noticed the movie &quot;Natural Born Killers.&quot; Immediately I jumped for joy because i was not interested in movies of my age group. And had always wanted to see this film because of one word:CONTROVERSIAL. Three words to described this film when i finally saw it: EDGY,DARK, and a little COMEDIC. While sitting in my living room i felt like i was on a roun-trip to rangoon that i couldnt control. The relationship between Mickey, and Mallory, moved me. And not because they were to serial killers, but because these two people generally loved each other. And would do anything to stay together. Props for Juliette Lewis and Woody Harrelson for pulling off one of the best movies of the 90's. And props to Oliver Stone and Quentin Taratino for pulling off a movie about serial killing and how people can be affected by it through the media.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This film was outrageous and i think much of the credit goes to Will Ferrell. The man is a comic genius! MY favorite Ferrell lines are:<BR>&quot;Were going streakin!&quot;<BR>&quot;Hey honey, is KFC still open?&quot;<BR>Hey honey its me, i was wonderin if you wanted to get yogurt or maybe an entire meal of food, call me back!&quot;<BR>there are so many more. Ferrell is king is this one!
B00005MNP8|5.0|This is their best cd ever! The lyrics are catchy and it has a great beat. The music is fun, profanity free, and all age groups can enjoy it. My 2 year old and 4 year old sister enjoy it, I enjoy it (I'm 13 years old), My 17 year old sister enjoys it, even my mom enjoys it! So if your looking for music that you can all agree on, this is your choice!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|The key word to this release is REMASTERED!!!!  Why talk about the songs, I'm sure by the year 2004 you have purchased Appetite, Illusion, etc.  It would have been nice to have the original album remastered and released, but if you own a hi-fi system over 5K, get this disc and enjoy the new sonics of the songs you already own. So, stop your useless gibberish and buy this album for 12 bucks.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|There's barely an original moment in Underworld, and sadly those parts that are derived from elsewhere in motion picture history (that is, all of it), are derived without wit or feeling for their antecedents or the genre.<br />I have a feeling this film would never have been made were it not for the Matrix. It basically is the Matrix, only with werewolves and vamps, and a blue wash over all the cinematography rather than a green one. So we have a hard-arsed chick in a tight patent-leather cat suit toting a sub-machine gun in each hand in a subway station, driving performance sports cars absurdly fast, performing aerial flips and other acrobatics. Only she's a vampire. With a laptop. We have perpetual rain: we have the trademark Wachowski straight-down shot of rain falling away from the camera onto parked cars in a narrow alley. There's a big final punch-up between two indestructible foes in a great big puddle.<br />But while it rips off the Matrix's visuals, Underworld has neither the wit - the tongue-in-cheek film noir; the fairly well spec'd cod philosophy - nor any of the style: Kate Beckinsale is no Carrie Anne Moss, having about as much sex appeal as a Tupperware lunchbox, and I'm afraid to say the all-important fight choreography *really* blows.<br />The bits that are original, sadly, tend to foul up the rest of the picture. To wit: pitting the \\"lycans\\" (nice try, by the way, to make werewolves sound hip. Didn't work) against vampires misses the fundamental point of both genres, which is the need-to-sleep-with-the-light-on-afterwards factor: they're supposed to GET US. And DRINK OUR BLOOD. In Underworld they're knocking six shades of hell out of each other (with guns... GUNS?? VAMPIRES WITH GUNS? What the hell is going on?), so rather than being terrifying, it plays out more like a moodily lit feature-length episode of the World Wrestling Federation. You don't really care who wins as long as there is damn good fight. But, as noted, the fight choreography is Woe Ful than Wo Ping.<br />There's zero chemistry between any of Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy or the other one and Kate - it's understandable, fellahs; it's hard to love an airtight plastic container.<br />Sophia Myles plays a decidedly plot-functional blonde vamp-girl who pops up at critical moments to push the narrative along, but doesn't end up having much to do with anything. I think she's rather petulantly sent to her room just before the climax, and you never see her again. Since she was about the most interesting part of the picture, that's a pity. For my money, Myles would have been a better female lead than Beckinsale.<br />A special \\"opportunity knocks\\" award should go to Bill Nighy, who's been underachieving in British TV dramas since 1979 or so, never showing up in anything of note, who finally snags a peach of a part in Love Actually, and now you can't get the old buzzard off your screen - a fading rock star there; a sleazy Tory MP in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet; a lecherous 19th Colonel in He Knew He Was Right and a now a thousand year old vampire uber-lord in Underworld, and ALL of them portrayed as exactly the same character! Even Kevin Costner would be impressed with that!<br />Not sure what he would have made of the rest of the film, however.<br />Olly BuxtonWoe Ful than Wo Ping. <br />There's zero chemistry between any of Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy or the other one and Kate - it's understandable, fellahs; it's hard to love an airtight plastic container. <br />Sophia Myles plays a decidedly plot-functional blonde vamp-girl who pops up at critical moments to push the narrative along, but doesn't end up having much to do with anything.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I went through 2 of these. Both were very nice before they blew out. They last me a little less than a year. They deliver a nice loud crisp sound especially for their small package but they don't last their lifetime which does not work for me.
0345452577|2.0|As tired as I've gotten of Alex and Robin's love trials, I couldn't help but miss that dysfunctional and self-important duo while reading \\"Conspiracy Club.\\" This book's main character, Jeremy Carrier, never comes to life and his adventures sound like Kellerman is phoning it in. . On the plus side, Kellerman's writing is as always a cut above the usual and he has good control over detail and pacing. Unfortunately, the women in this book make even stick figures like Robin seem complex. The scenes in the conspiracy club are  cartoonish and about as menacing as an afternoon in a nursing home rec room. Bring back Alex and his rich boy, can't commit melodramas! As much as he gets on my nerves, at least he got a bit more to him than a \\"tragic secret.\\"
B000002KDX|5.0|Sure, there are inevitable comparisons to Crosby, Stills and Nash. They are unavoidable because anyone playing acoustic guitars and singing harmonies will bring them to mind.<br />Comparisons aside, this is one great album. Every time I listen to it, it's like another acoustic guitar lesson. The interplay and blending of the guitars is very inspiring. The songs are good and the singing is right on the mark. I didn't realize what a big influence these guys were until I picked this up on CD and started listening to it again on a regular basis.<br />If you like acoustic guitars this is a must have disc.
B00004T9UF|5.0|the whole cd is AWESOME!!!!the only song i dont like is 'Remember Me'this cd is by far his best!!!
B0000042MY|5.0|I must confess I am a avid collector of soundtracks.  Many times I buy the soundtrack before seeing the movie.  I saw this movie about 10 times before buying the soundtrack.  I like the music and when playing the CD I relax and close my eyes.  The music pulls you in and the feeling is unique.  Buy the CD and when you play it the first time turn up the volumn slightly higher than you normally do.  The music is unique and timeless.
B0002234LS|3.0|Personally, I disagree with the person above on \\"how bad\\" this movie is. If you're into bone-chilling sequences, then obviously this isn't for you, but if you're wanting a suspensful/mildy humorous in spots movie to watch with your friends or family... this is one you should have in your collection. I know some people don't like it that much, but if you are a true fan of Johnny Depp.. you'll know why he did it. It's a good flick...
B00000AFGM|3.0|After the acclaimed &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, Marilyn Manson released this effort that shows a new and perhaps more interesting direction. Not as goth/metal oriented as previous records, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; delivers a meld of glam rock and electronica, presenting a couple of surprinsingly effective &quot;ballads&quot; along the way. Besides the convincing hits &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, &quot;Rock id Dead&quot; and &quot;Coma White&quot;, this album includes strong songs like the opener &quot;Great Big White World&quot;, the addictive &quot;User Friendly&quot; or the superb and haunting &quot;The Last Day on Earth&quot;. &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is a worthwile rock record, offering futuristic soundscapes mixed with some retro moments (there are some 80`s influences at parts). It is also one of Marilyn Manson`s more solid achievements, much more interesting than the band`s most recent efforts.<br />A keeper.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is indeed the defining role for Murray. I am looking forward to watching Sofia Copola's career develop and will watch anything she makes because of this movie. <br />For anyone who has traveled internationally, you will identify with it immeidately! <br />The wit is dry and provincial twits won't get it, but it is one of the funniest movies of the decade.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I was a bit nervous about seeing this as one of my close friends was so freaked out by it she had to leave the cinema, but after seeing this last night, I offer a round of applause to all who were involved in the film.<BR>An intriguing plot with a chilling theme compliments fantastically the superb acting seen from all in the movie, and definitely a film I will want to see again and again.<br />Well done guys!
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta has made a practically flawless album with De-loused....a concept album only matched by Coheed and Cambria's two masterpieces.  The lyrics are very confusing but masterful none the less, and to make an album over an hour long with really only 8 songs is pretty unreal.  All the track are great but my favorites are 2,3,6,7,10. It is hard to single any tracks out though, you have to listen to this all the way through for the best experience.  There is so many amazing moments all over this cd. ie. Eriatarka:'evaporate the fur/it covers them/if you only knew the plans they had for us.' Televators has its moments too, but Roulettes... and Take the Veil.... definetely have the best 'chorusus' if you will.<br />Definetely pick this one up, they were only charging 8.99CAN at one store, and thats only about 6 bucks american (the best bargain you'll find.)
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Seriously, folks, Clapton is never going to have the creative cajones required to take Johnson's material to the so-called \\"next\\" level, as Keb Mo' did with his version of \\"Love in Vain.\\"  The source material in this case is too sacred to him.  So:  Does EC play it safe?  YES.  Does he push the boundaries of what a blues record should be?  NO.  BUT!  Aside from \\"Love in Vain\\" he does put together a concise, easily-accessible library of Johnson interpretations that will stand up against most other reinterpretations.  While being fairly standard, it's also modest, both in it's packaging and it's promotion.  This is one of Clapton's \\"no big deal\\" in-betweeners.  If you don't expect the final word on Johnson's music, and you love the blues, this record is for you.   Also, if you want to get someone into the blues, this one's a good starting point.  Just don't expect too much.  EC obviously didn't.  Go see the concerts.  As everyone knows, this is where he's really going to cook anyway.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|The least that Geffen could have done is released a 2 disc Greatest Hits.  They left off so much other great songs such as &quot;Estranged&quot; &quot;The Garden&quot; &quot;Coma&quot; &quot;You Could Mine&quot; plus plenty of others off of GN'R Lies and Appetite for Destruction.  And I too think that we will never see this new GN'R cd &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;.  Either Axel is scared that the new Guns n Roses wont be as great as the original or he is hiding from the rest of the original GN'R line up.<br />Don't get me wrong Guns n Roses is a great band.  Instead of buying this cd though I think you should just get the full albums of &quot;Appetite&quot; &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; set &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;.

B00000055E|5.0|This album is prime Pac, his best. It's a perfect blend of true gangtsa rap and spiritualism. Most of these songs have the most punch and bang straight than any other rap EVER.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is one of the most amazing bands in the world.  This a CD that everyone should own.  I just saw them last night at the Metro and it was the best show I've ever seen in my life.  They are so dynamic and exciting live.  They rock out like no other.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|It is only fitting that the soundtracks to Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films be as diverse and strangely attractive as the epic masterpiece he's splashed on the screen. The soundtrack to &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 2&quot; has everything from Ennio Morricone compositions to flamenco to a cover of &quot;About Her.&quot; The opening track is an entertaining monologue lifted from the film's opening where The Bride (Uma Thurman) rides in a car and explains to the audience her mission and destination (which is to kill Bill of course). What follows is a rich, entertaining mish-mash of styles and sounds. We get a few Ennio Morricone melodies that give the film a wonderful Sergio Leone type western feel. There's some great flamenco by Lole Y Manuel and even Johnny Cash pops in with &quot;A Satisfied Mind.&quot; One of the pleasant discoveries for many will be the band Shivaree with their moody, almost jazzy &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; which is probably already known by those of us who have scrambled in the music underground looking for a good jam, but for the more mainstream listener this will be a pleasant surprise. Chingon (I can already sense the Spanish speakers grinning at the title) give us an exciting, romantic &quot;Malaguena Salerosa&quot; which is a great contemporary update on the original. The dialogue tracks are interesting in themselves and flesh out the story. The best dialogue track is &quot;The Legend Of Pai Mei&quot; where Bill (David Carradine) tells the story of an old martial arts master while playing his flute. All in all this is a fulfilling, entertaining sonic escape for Tarantino fans and fanatics of &quot;Kill Bill.&quot; A must for fans of both mentioned titles.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|I enjoy Cannibal Corpse as much as the next person, but people do have to admit that they have been fairly repetitious for the last 4-5 albums.  The Wretched Spawn has some really great songs, and it is far better than 2002's Gore Obsessed, but overall it is missing something.<br />The guitar/bass work on this album is very technical and flat-out phenomenal, just as Alex Webster says on the companion making-of DVD, but the drums continue to be the drab old school death metal drums that harm and lessen the great guitar/bass work.  Unlike most other music, drums really do determine the feel and sound of a death metal band, and a bad drummer will make a band sound horrible, no matter how good the guitarists are.  CC seriously needs to get a better drummer, someone who can inject a little variety and technicality into the songs, as well as some better fills.  CC could be putting all death metal bands to shame, but instead they insist on sticking to the old school drum style which any drummer (me included) that has an inkling of focus and dedication can develop in a few months.  It's not hard -- you just need the endurance.  Paul Mazurkiewicz should listen to drummers like Gene Hoglan, Sean Reinert &amp; Mike Portnoy and learn some new chops.<br />As for the album content, I particularly liked &quot;Frantic Disembowelment&quot; and &quot;Festering in the Crypt&quot;, but I found the album to be too long.  Most death metal albums nowadays are much too long - they generally work best when limited to around 35 minutes.  With 13 songs, CC drags this album a bit too much.  11 songs would probably have been perfect.  The lyrics are nothing special, of course - it's the same stuff we've heard from them for years.<br />The best part of this album, though, is the companion DVD that comes with it.  Having been in a few bands myself, I found it particularly enlightening to see how to they write and record an album.  It was also nice to see the guys being themselves and learning about their interests, etc.  Even if you're tired of CC's musical non-progression, but still like their older albums, I would suggest getting this for the DVD alone.  That, and the artwork, which is very nice.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|And its a big one. This film was conceived original to be aired on JAL (Japan Air Lines). Mr. Miyazaki intended this film to appeal to the tired japanese businessmen coming home. It is also something of a personal project. He has always loved airplanes and this film was a way including it in one of his works.<br />I find no fault with any of the other reviews here. But you should remember that his other films were intended for a broader group of veiwers, Kiki's delevery service for example. If you liked or loved any or all of Miyazaki san's films then get this one. Its well worth it.
B000066NW0|4.0|So many people have criticized and reprimanded Avril Lavigne for being a supposed \\"poser\\" and have failed to look at the substance in her debut album. While it is an album geared for a younger audience, it is an interesting album with a mix of musical genres. At the opening you hear the guitar driven \\"Losing Grip\\". Which sadly is one of the only two rock-style songs (the other being \\"Unwanted\\"). You are then carried into a pop-rock style with songs like: \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8ter Boi\\", and \\"Mobile\\". Other album highlights are Lavigne's ballads. They are sweet and very relatable. \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Naked\\", and \\"Tomorrow\\" are songs that drive this album to four stars instead of three. Through out this album you can literally hear the producers experimenting trying to discover Lavigne's sound. Her voice has a definite change in style in \\"My World\\" and your left unsure of how to digest Avril with her pop-rap style in \\"Nobody's Fool\\". This album is also a little quirky when it comes to the lyrics. Lavigne is trying to hard at points of the album to stick to her rhyme scheme. I'd say this album is a successful debut, but I am looking forward to hearing a more substantial progressed Lavigne in the future.
0671578642|4.0|Thus is the 2nd volume of the lengthy Honor Harrington sage, now up to 10 volumes and still far from complete.  Honor is a Captain (later Admiral) in the space Navy of the Star Kingdom of Manticore, which is under attack by the larger Republic of Haven.  The series is based to a large extent on the popular Horatio Hornblower novels, and the background history accordingly based on the Napoleonic wars.<br />This installation finds Honor sent to protect Grayson, a relatively weak world allied to Manticore.  Grayson was founded by religious reactionaries; its traditional enemy Masada by even more extreme conservatives of the same sect.  So it's a society where women are expected to be subservient.  There is also little tradition of technological innovation, so the Grayson fleet is backwards and of limited value when Haven sends a fleet of modern ships to ally with Masada.  But Honor is assigned to hold the situation in check with, as usual, a grossly inadequate force.  The story builds to a concusion where Honor will be forced to fight a battle against a hugely superior enemy, something of a stock plot for the Harrington series, especially the early entrants.  The subplots focus on Grayson domestic politics and a conspiracy to assassinate the Protector, the Grayson head of state.<br />Both the strengths and weaknesses of the book are those of the series.  Honor is an attractive character and the Grayson society is interesting.  The story is suspenseful and exciting, making for a good read.  On the negative side, Weber has worked out in detail all the technical aspects of the ships and weaponry he is describing, and he doesn't let any of that work go to waste.  I once heard an experienced SF editor advise would-be writers to work out the background for their stories in detail and then not directly use most of it.  The fact that you have thought it out will give it a realistic feel, while you avoid boring the reader with excessive exposition.  Good advice, which Weber fails to use.  He goes into ship sizes, throw weights, and relative velocities with such loving detail that some passages read almost like a parody of the excesses of hard SF.<br />The political preaching in this novel is also unnecessary.  In Weber's universe, welfare is almost literally the root of all evil.  The generous welfare system of Haven is portrayed as having wrecked the economy; the military aggressiveness is seen as a direct result of the weak economy, forcing Haven to conquer more productive worlds in order to generate the wealth needed to keep up the dole payemnts for the Haven core worlds.  This is explained in almost identical expository sermons in each of the first several Honor Harrington novels.  The identical fervor of the same speech repeating in several volumes left Weber at monemts in danger of turning into the John Norman of the hard SF fraternity.  Fortunately, Weber ultimately avoided that temptation and no longer gives the same set sppech in each novel.  And, of course, he can write better than the execrably leaden prose of Norman.<br />The flaws give the book some moments of awkwardness, but Weber is smart enough to get back to the story before things get too boring.  So I can give this book a solid recommendation in spite of the faults.  It can be read without having read the prior volume, &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot;.
6305897786|4.0|The Ninth Gate is a very good psychological thriller/horror movie with an excellent cast.  Dean Corso is a rare book dealer who hunts down and authenticates rare and antique books for clients.  A rich collector, Boris Balkan, hires Corso to hunt down two copies of a book that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer himself.  Corso embarks on a journey that takes him to Spain, Portugal, and France in order to find the other two copies of &quot;The Ninth Gate.&quot;  Almost immediately, Corso begins to notice strange things happening all around him once he takes possession of Balkan's copy.  This was a very enjoyable movie that was billed as your typical horror movie, but is really anything but that.  The movie is beautifully shot with plenty of Gothic themed settings.  The ending of the movie is up for your own interpretation so I won't go into what I thought.  For a very good movie that keeps you guessing throughout, check out The Ninth Gate.<br />  Johnny Depp is very good as Dean Corso, the rare book dealer who is only interested in himself and how much money he can earn.  Frank Langella is also very good as Boris Balkan, the rich collector who hires Corso to find the remaining two copies of The Ninth Gate.  Emmanuelle Seigner plays the Girl, a woman who mysteriously follows Corso as he travels across Europe.  The movie also stars Lena Olin, Barbara Jefford, Jack Taylor, and James Russo.  The DVD offers commentary from director Roman Polanski, a making of documentary, production stills/information, and widescreen presentation.  For a good psychological/thriller with a good performance by Johnny Depp, check out The Ninth Gate!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|...and I'm happily not alone in sharing that opinion, judging from the many, many other reviewers here-thank goodness!<br />I owned an edition with many of these extras in the laserdisc format, and it's terrific that it's now been released on DVD with even more fun goodies...although it could be simply the film itself, nothing else on this DVD-and believe me, you'd be more than satisfied.<br />This is one of those &quot;classic&quot; films that are so famous you might feel you know it already-even if you haven't seen it.  And, you may dismiss it out of hand if you HAVEN'T seen it as &quot;corny&quot; or kitchy-DON'T!<br />I've been lucky enough to see this in a theatre recently with an audience which included lots of pretty jaded kids-exactly the demographic you'd expect to be embarrassed at the thought of sitting through an &quot;old&quot; movie like this...and they cheered along with the diehard film buffs and old-timers.  In fact, I defy anyone to dislike this film...it's just got everything, as has been pointed out elsewhere here:  a terrific script, brilliant Technicolor(literally eye-popping!), beautiful scenery and costumes, one of the very greatest of film scores by an acknowledged master-and especially, crucially, the cast:  Errol Flynn is funny, athletic, gorgeous, and witty in a role that-well, how can it have been easy to attempt playing?  Even in 1937 &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was a fairy tale of a story...but Flynn pulls it off brilliantly.  Every single actor in the cast, in fact, is spot-on perfect casting.  And it mightn't have been that way:  listen to Rudy Behlmer's peerless commentary(the standard to which all other golden age commentaries should be held)and discover a primer in filmmaking, studio politics, the history of the legend of Robin Hood, and more...amazing!<br />This is definitely one of those &quot;satisfied or your money back!&quot; experiences; Warner Bros. could risk it, because no one would want a refund.  Have a ball!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Just about everyone on here is complaining about how these are the special editions and thus won't buy it. how they want the original versons. how greedy lucas is. how other directors are able to release different versions of their films on DVD. how he's trying to get people to buy the DVD set using deceptive package labelling. yada yada yada, blah blah blah, wah wah wah. oh, stop already. it's like a bottomless pit of complaining. i tried looking for one rational review about the trilogy, but it was hopeless, so why not start one on my own.<br />Most people don't understand why lucas is doing what he's doing and thus settle for simple assumptions that he's doing it for the money on top of other reasons. if this were the case, would he not pack in both versions of each film into the dvd set and thus double the price of it? so-called \\"fans\\" these days are too quick to judge. i'm not saying that money isn't an issue at all, because it always comes into consideration, but there are also more decisive factors.<br />The reason Lucas is not releasing the original versions is because the Special Edition versions are the films he \\"originally intended to make.\\" he's said this countless times in interviews. he wasn't able to accomplish these versions during the late 70's early 80's because the technology wasn't there. that is the whole reason he created Industrial Light and Magic. somebody mentioned that da vinci didn't re-touch his paintings, but hey, da vinci had all the paint he needed, whereas Lucas didn't have all his \\"paint\\" until the mid 90's.<br />It's been done before many times where two different versions of the same film are released on DVD. for example, Spielberg released both versions of ET on DVD and Peter Jackson released Theatrical and Extended Editions of each Lord of the Rings part, but the arguement here is that neither of those versions are \\"unfinished\\" films. the state of being \\"unfinished\\" is of course determend by the filmmaker and those directors don't apply the term to their versions. they are happy with the original versions. on the other hand, Lucas isn't content with the original versions of Episode IV-VI. they're like  unfinished pieces of artwork to him. they were not as he envisioned them. he doesn't want people to see those anymore, he wants them to see his \\"finished\\" product, as most artists would agree.<br />The reason the packaging is not labeled with the words \\"Special Edition\\" is because for some time now, this has been his only edition, his finished piece, his final cut. It is not meant to \\"trick\\" consumers, for he's mentioned this countless times years ago up until the present, that these will be the only versions of these Star Wars films.<br />I'm defending lucas, sure, because there's reason to. don't get me wrong, i'd rejoice in the event lucas was to change his mind about not releasing the originals, but that's only something that should be wished for, not demanded. i don't even like the guy all that much... met him once and he wasn't very pleasant, but the final cut is his decision because he is the filmmaker after all, not us.  <br />now those purists who still don't understand it and continue to nag, still have their low resolution VIDEO TAPES that they can  watch (until their VCRs eat them up at least). and those purists who complain, but still give in to the DVD set... one word: Hypocrites.<br />If you liked the original versions, there's no reason that you shouldn't like the Special Editions. You may \\"prefer\\" the original versions, but that's no reason to \\"despise\\" the Special Editions because nothing Lucas added changed the movies all that much. <br />These films are timeless masterpieces. Highly recommeneded. ...and i haven't even mentioned Bonus Material. =b
B000002J1O|5.0|i was initally given this cd by my guitar teacher after asking aboout genesis, who got into the band off this cd too.  genesis isnt that phil collins and super pop? placing the cd in my stero i was blown away...i had never heard anything like this.  at first this album scared me a lot, the changing time signatures, different surreal layered sounds- i was quick to layer it freaky.  however after later listens, something happened- the songs begain to get stuck in my head, the melodies and awesome gabriel lyrics caught on to me. each time i listen to this cd, i find a new layer or something cool i hadnt noticed before i.e. steve hackett pioneering the two finger tapping on dancing with the moonlight knight.<BR>i strongly encourage this album (i prefer it over lamb lies down...my other fav is and then there were three-the mix of prog/pop) please listen with and open mind and opne ears, i almost dismissed this wonderful album, id hate for anyone out there to miss or judge it wrong
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette is a former Canadian pop-princess that was ordained \\"Angry White Female\\" by Rolling Stone Magazine in 1995. After releasing two pop albums (in Canada) Morissette was feeling disillusioned with her musical direction. So she packed her bags and moved to L.A. Once in L.A. she met Glen Ballard and her music was changed forever. In the summer of 1995 Maverick Records released her debut album, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". An album that is full of emotional extremes. Morissette's angry, sarcastic, and vengeful voice is apparent on songs \\"All I Really Want\\", \\"You Oughta Know\\", and \\"Right Through You\\". However, this album is not just the confessions of an \\"angry white female\\". Other songs like \\"Perfect\\", \\"You Learn\\", \\"Head Over Feet\\", &amp; \\"Mary Jane\\" reveal an emotionally distraught and saddened Morissette.  This album is expressive and truly a work of art. Morissette's writing styles are unconventional and true to what she is  thinking and feeling. This is one of those rare albums that you can put on and listen through without interruption. When you hear this album you'll understand why it was the most successful album by a female ever.
0780626966|5.0|Freddy Kruger has got to be the scariest character in any movie Ive ever seen.Some way and somehow he always manages to pop up into your dreams.I love horror and the Nightmare On Elm Street Series has some movies that are pure horror.Out of all the movies the original Nightmare On Elm Street and New Nightmare are the scariest.Have you ever seen anything quite as scary as the beginning of Nightmare On Elm Street where he brutally kills Tina?I havent.That scene is the best scene in the movie it manages to be cartoonish and realistic.And New Nightmare is just plain scary.I also like Dream Master and Dream Warriors almost as much.Those 4 movies are the reasons why you should own this set even though the other movies are pretty decent too and give you a chance to be a critic.
6305558167|5.0|The plot is King Arthur, but the Theme is about the one God and Christianity.  The symbolism and metaphors are everywhere in this film.  My favorite is the Grail on the breastplate(s) in Arthur and Gwennivere's wedding - very subtly done - a primeval if not primordial scene in which the motifs of Early Christianity and the sun/nature worshippers of the day were very much in a symbiotic and coexistent relationship.  The magnificence of this film is in the intertwining of the Arthur legend, the inverted crucifix of St. Peter as sword and the land.
B000003TAW|5.0|You can call Weezer whatever you want to. What they are is a great rock n roll band. <br />This album has a lot of good songs on it. THe best song on the album is Buddy Holly. It's got some great and catchy guitar rifts. Rivers won't blow you away with his vocals on this track, but you will find yourself singing along with him or whistling. It's a great written song and one of the best songs of the 90's. You have to check out the music video for it also. Simply awesome.<br />I love In the Garage. The band really does tell a lot about themselves in this song. These guys don't care if you call them dorks. In the song they talk about how they love D&amp;D and there favorite band is Kiss. They don't care what people think of them. They just want to stay in the garage and play there songs. It's a beautiful song where the guys really embrace who they are.<br />The sweater song is one of the more famous songs off the album. It's kind of a creepy song, but is very catchy. You will find yourself singing along and it's a song that sticks with you.<br />All of the songs on the album are great. This is one of the few albums made anymore where you will put it on and listen to every song. Weezer is the best geek rock band since REM. They are an amazing band with the talent to back it up. No rock collection is complete without this album. It's one of the 10 best made in the 90's and is a must own.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden actually made three outstanding albums: The Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave. I often refer to them as the &quot;Maiden Trilogy.&quot; This just happens to be my personal favorite because, as an awkward preteen it was the first real metal album I ever bought. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; begins pounding you with its memorable opening riff the moment you push play. Other killer tracks (and Maiden classics) include the mythology-inspired &quot;Flight Of Icarus,&quot; the stark and beautiful &quot;Still Life,&quot; and the pulsating and apocalyptic riffage of &quot;Revelation.&quot; &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; are also great songs. &quot;Sun And Steel&quot; and &quot;Quest For Fire&quot; seem a little weak next to the other powerhouse tracks, but are still better than a lot of the later Maiden stuff. No hair band posturing, no speed metal flash, just awesome vocals, musicianship and pure leather and studs heavy metal at its finest.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Normally I don't give 5 stars unless I enjoy almost all the songs. But despite some songs that I don't like as much, most of the songs are pretty good and a few are amazing. My favorite songs are Porcelain, Inside (the name is very indicative of the sound), the two acoustic songs Everloving and Guitar, Flute &amp; String, and My Weakness. My Weakness is a powerful song that makes me think I've died and I'm drifting towards the bright light. These songs make this a great album, and because my least favorite songs aren't that bad, it deserves 5 stars.
0739313126|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is like a gleaming used car whose odometer has been altered and its documents falsified-a nice-looking lemon. Buyer beware.<br />The Da Vinci Code is too crowded with errors to begin to cover all of them.<br />Is The Da Vinci Code thesis supported, as it claims, by well-accepted historical and art authorities?<br />Just the opposite. Brown, not a scholar or historian, cites no accepted historians or New Testament scholars to back him up. But a long line of scholars - Christian and non-Christian, conservative and liberal - has dismissed the book's allegations.<br />Further, The Da Vinci Code bungles elementary facts, raising serious doubts about its overall reliability:<br />· The famous Dead Sea Scrolls are said to have been discovered in the 1950s. They weren't.<br />. Ottawa the capital of Canada just had the scrolls on exibition for all the world to see with the right dates.<br />· Brown says the Dead Sea Scrolls contained outlawed gospels that have shed new light on \\"the truth\\" about Jesus. In fact, it is well-known that the Scrolls contain no material about Jesus. Most date to about 200 years before Jesus lived, and their main significance is that they include Old Testament documents.<br />· Brown claims the vote on Christ's deity at the Council of Nicea was \\"relatively close.\\" The actual count was 298-2!<br />Although this book is fiction, the fact that Mr. Brown states so many &quot;facts&quot; that are not true, It is a book a person should be very careful of.<br />Read the Bible.......
B00005JKGZ|4.0|First off I will say this DVD is great, however it is not without its flaws.  The problem is not that this restoration does not give great detail.  In fact its detail is amazing.  The problem is with the supposed Technicolor and a picture that is too dark.  Look at Judy as she sings &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;.  She is wearing a lovely period dress that has blue stripes.  Unlike previous versions, this version the stripes are so dark that you can hardly tell that they are blue.  Other scenes have similar problems of darkness.  Otherwise this edition is spectacular with lots of extra features to feast on.  The sound is a revelation in surround sound.  Regarding the image, I know that I am sounding a little picky but Technicolor is what attracts people to films like this and I am disappointed when the colors do not pop out like they should.  I would love to hear other opinions of anyone who feels the same way about this color and darkness issue of this new edition. Enough said.  Feel free to email.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List tells the story of one man's defying struggle to help the suffering Jewish during the Nazi reign of WWII. Widely considered to be Spielberg's greatest film ever, this doesn't go without a reason. Every frame of Schindler's List is breathtaking, beautiful, and sometimes horrific. But if there is a perfect film out there, this would be it. This epic features amazing performances from every cast member, and unbelievable performances from from Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley. (...)<BR>The best part of Schindler's List is how you feel as if you fit into the film. It's not just a story about Schindler, but a story that actually makes the viewer feel as if they are a part of the (...)Nazi world. You feel pity for the Jewish, feel hatred for the Germans, and feel sadness for Oskar Schindler. <BR>Spielberg obviously took time to make every frame feel as important as the next one, and they are all terrific. From witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, to the horror of the gas chambers, every part of the film is an epic. If only every film would follow Schindler's List's lead, the world would have a perfect cinematic experience. But a movie such as Schindler's List is so rare and few between, that you shouldn't expect to feel this moved ever again. A moviemaking masterpiece!
6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead 2 is not just another low budget horror movie.  It is a singular experience.  There is no other movie like it.  If it were not for Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, a very different movie of the same genre, I would say that it is, by far, the best horror/comedy ever made.  I hate saying horror/comedy, but I guess it fits.  <br />The story is simple:  Ashe and his girlfriend Linda take a trip out to, what he has assessed To be an abandoned cottage in the woods.  After a little cagey chit chat, Ashe discovers a tape recorder and decides to play the tape.  On the tape are ancient incantations from the &quot;Sumerian Book of the Dead&quot; that, once again, awaken a demon inhabiting the very woods surrounding them.  The demon possesses Linda and the fun is underway.  The movie never lets up from here on out.<br />The production is amazing.  One of the best aspects of the movie is the combined use of sound effects, cinematography, and editing in such a way that they compliment each other and become, in effect, one effect (excuse the silly redundancy.)  The jarring sounds, mixed with the equally jarring angles and lens usage, together with the tight editing makes for a movie that moves along like wildfire.  Add to this the impossibly charismatic character of Ashe, portrayed perfectly by Bruce Campbell (I swear he was born specifically to make this movie) and you have the best movie of the genre, and, come to think of it, the best movie Sam Raimi has ever made.
B00001NFCY|4.0|I'd always heard that Creed was a &quot;pretty boy god band&quot; and that they effectively sucked on all levels.   Then I heard a snippet of &quot;What If&quot; in Scream 3 and I just had to know who did it.  When I found out it was Creed, I really didn't care what the lyrics were about.   It's just a slamming good song.  I'm a dyed-in-the-wool agnostic, a big fan of the Deftones and any other band capable of delivering fat guitar riffs and good tunes.  Human Clay does that from the first track to the last.  Who cares if Scott Stapp sounds like Eddie Vedder?  Since when was that a crime?  Ignore the nay-sayers and just dig the music.
B000001DQI|5.0|The 1973 classic, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is Elton John's masterpiece. It is a monumental, two-disc opus (now a remastered disc), which has a wide-array of styles from classical to rock. On this album, Elton experiments with the ARP synthesizer and keyboards. His band, guitarist Davey Johnstone, bassist Dee Murray, and drummer Nigel Olsson are energetic as even. Bernie Tapuin wrote great lyrics and themes on here. So, what's the problem? The whole album itself, is a little uneven. It should've been cut into a single album. Ok, let's get to some of the songs. \\"Funeral for a Friend/ Love Lies Bleeding\\" is an eleven-minute prog-rock classic. I think it's an ode to Elton's music. \\"Candle in the Wind\\" is one of Elton's best-known classics. It's really sad because it's dedicated to Marilyn Monroe. Davey Johnstones's guitar work is great and Nigel's drumming is powerful.\\"Bennie & the Jets\\" is a Bowie-like, glam rock classic. It actually sounds like a R&B flavored track. It's one of my favorite songs by Elton. The next song, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is a ballad that is still EJ's best ballads. The next 3 songs, \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\", \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\", and \\"This Song Has No Title\\" are entertaining, but they are somewhat throwaways. \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" is a gentle song with Elton singing about a seaside hooker. It's one of my personal favorites on this album.  Another hit, \\"All The Girls Love Alice\\" is about a girl who is a lesbian that dies. It's probably the most self-indulgent song on here. \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" is one of Elton's well-known tracks. It is a hard-rock tune that has Davey playing his best guitar hooks. The ending, \\"Harmony\\" is a great, but depressing ballad. Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is a milestone in pop music. Though, it excessively has filler, it still stands as his masterpiece. All of Elton's best work is here. It is a worthy addition to your collection. A-
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Even as a straight female, I found the opening shots, scanning a variety of STUNNING women, engaged in their NYC lives, quite erotic, especially as choreographed to \\"Butterfly, by Crazy Town.  <br />The rest of the film is  \\"watch-able\\" - but highly unbelievable. Neither Diane Keaton, nor Jack Nicholson impressed me much.  They're charming and quirky in the ways we're familiar with - watching them over so many years.  This isn't a sexy film - and doesn't do much to negate stereotypes of aging men and women. <br />For me, Frances McDormund (spelling?) was the revelation of the film.  She's the one who defies streotypes.  She's cast as the no make-up, dressed like a boy, Women's Studie's Prof.  She delivers a feminist rant one minute , and laughs at herself the next.  Most surprsing, in going against stereotypes of the hot chick (like those at the beginning of the film), she is actually really sexy.  She does a slightly lewd dance to Marvin Gaye's \\"Let's Get It On\\"  - she's hot, funny, ostensibly single - yet happy.  Now there's a woman I can identify with!
B000088E6D|5.0|Buble is here at the right time with the right voice for those of us who remember the great male and female standard singers of days gone by, he will be loved by the followers of Sinatra, Darin, Damone, Julie london and all the rest and I believe he has already been discovered by the young people interested in good music and outstanding young musicians, good job, five stars
B000001DV2|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Pyromania and Hysteria. They are both amazing albums that epitomized the 80's in every way. However, Adrenalize is not only my favorite album they ever produced, it is my favorite cd EVER by anyone, hands down. From &quot;Lets get rocked&quot; to &quot;Have you ever needed someone so bad&quot; this album had everything you could want on it. It's a lot of fun to listen to, and the ballads are just incredible. Todays music is either so stupid that you can't bear to listen to it or too depressing. This album is neither. Just plain awesome, and the lyrics are phenominal. I may only be 21 but I know great rock and no one to this day has topped their efforts on this one. Just buy it and you'll see what I mean.
B00005JME0|4.0|The trailer for this film made it look like a mess. Giving us far too much information in a few seconds and turning me completely off it. I only saw it at the cinema because there was nothing else on and I'm glad I gave it a tiny chance.<br />The concept is intriguing and the execution is brilliantly done. Set at three different stages in the lives of the four main characters we are quickly familiar with the sometimes curious, sometimes devastating events that shape their lives. The relationships between Evan, Kalley, Lenny and Tommy are very well developed and it's very interesting to watch them twist and change as Evan suffers from constant black-outs, Tommy goes totally insane and Kalley and Lenny even insaner. Almost all of them end up in the nut-house at some point.<br />It's at this point that the older Evan (a horrifically bearded, pre-packaged and homogenised 'pretty boy' Ashton Kutcher) decides to time travel back to his childhood, thanks to his incredible memory (how this is achieved is never explained!!!) and put right what once went wrong. Only each time he tries he just makes things worse and worse.<br />The storylines involving the younger quartet are truly the best bits of the film. The young Tommy is one of the most evil and depraved characters I have ever seen and the younger Evan is far more interesting than his future counterpart. Whenever the film flashes forward to the college years I found it extremely lagging and wished for another time travel scene. Ashton Kutcher was far less expressive than his younger actors.<br />And am I the only one noticing several nods to Se7en? Not only do they go see the movie as kids (how they got in is never explained either but I'm assuming they got tickets for Dumb and Dumber and sneaked in) but Evan's journals (his method of time travel!) are exactly the same as John Doe's and are written in the same manner. A curious bit of trivia indeed.<br />For a film with a great story, a few scares and wonderfully (if not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out. Tho I have one thing to ask the older Evan. What do you think is going to happen to your body if you stand in front of a mailbox being exploded by a lethal stick of dynamite???not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out.

B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is beautiful and moving. Highly reccommended, although I suggest you wait to purchase this movie until it comes out on special edition DVD in late 2004!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie DOES require a specific mind-set.  Most films hit you so hard over the head that they require nothing of the viewer.  This film asks a lot of the viewer, the characters don't share every though and feeling in long, overly scripted monologues.  Two disenfranchised people find solace in one another's company.  It's so simple a premise, yet there is so much going on, on an emotional level.  If I don't get this film for my birthday I'm going to hugely disappointed.<br />I'm not going to try and generalize.  I'm not going to say all people who like this film are this, and all people who hate this film are that.  Things affect people differently.<br />oh, yeah... ee cummings is dead.  please use the shift key.  no caps = annoying to read.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The CLASH were one of the best (if not the best) punk bands of the 70-80's, and this is their 'Sistine Chapel'.  It combines the urgency, angst, and passion of the band without putting you through the 'punk' sound througout (you can get that with their awesome debut 'The Clash'), however the message is loud and clear.  No GUTS are lost on LONDON CALLING, as this CD portrays the extensive talents of the band (especially on the reggae end), but does not *bury* their punk sound or roots.  It is the perfect extension of a 'sound' that was not to last forever, so the Clash decided to add a bit more - but at the same time not loose their EDGE.  Is this just another punk CD - HARDLY.  It is one that took the genre - one that was to change the landscape of lame music all about - and DID IT.  Heck, they are Hall of Famers, and this big punk fan from forever ago (I am 45 now) HAIL the Clash!!!!!  The only band that matters...<br />This CD is a perfect bookend to their first CD (just called The Clash), as you can hear in their early days that some reggae is OK to mix in with the punk-thrash we all know and love.  As far as what they did after this one, I got it all...and I still think this was really their best stuff...SANDINISTA had it's moments, and COMBAT ROCK was their commercial thing (with a few great numbers, mind you).  LONDON CALLING - 'well, some of it was true'...I'd say ALL of it, and this CD is simply essential for anyone who wants a piece of that punk movement, however I would qualify it further to say that this one is a great addition to any rock and roll collection that 'accepts' anything before 1970.
0618526412|5.0|If William Faulkner and the modernists are believed to be literary Cubists, then I think it's fair to say that Carson McCullers is a bit of a literary Surrealist. Apparently French publishers LGF (Le Livre de Poche) had similar thoughts when they put a painting inspired by the surrealist painter Magritte on the cover of the French translation of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. <br />Much like surrealist art, Hunter juxtaposes opposites, delves into the freakish, and poses unnatural combinations. McCullers' writes about a die-hard Marxist trying to convince a community of Southern Christian African-Americans to rise and take action against oppression and follow the ways of the atheist Karl Marx, and he does this during a Christmas party. Seem a bit surreal? <br />If not then what about an alcoholic drifter who comments on the hypocrisies of the Daughter's of the American Revolution? If that doesn't seem surrealistic enough for you then how about a deaf man being the one person a group of misfits seek to talk to, or the only person said deaf man feels he can communicate with is an overweight, insane, Greek immigrant? <br />McCullers uses Hunter to show that in the sluggish, reluctant to change South there are those who \\"know,\\" those who see something askew. McCullers shows how \\"those in the know\\" struggle to deal with a reality they can neither understand nor change.  <br />The Heart is a Lonely Hunter gives an extraordinary point of view to seemingly ordinary lives, and deals with issues such as loneliness, racism, and self-discovery. McCullers is an often overlooked writer who lived a life more interesting than most fiction written by her peers, and certainly on par with such famous \\"hard lived\\" authors as Hemmingway. Hunter is her first and most beautiful work of art. A masterpiece worthy of a place upon your shelf and in your heart.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Really Clapton need an other life to understand the blues (he had the money in that one). Listen to Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton , Blind Blake or the fat possum Label and let Clapton with his admiration for the very conservative and racist british politician Enoch Powell .
0618526412|5.0|The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a moving story that is written in a spare and elegant voice. Carson McCullers explores abandonment, loneliness and loss in great depth.  I read this book years ago in high school.  As a teenager who didn't fit in and who felt no one understood her, I felt that The Heart is a Lonely Hunter spoke to my own heart.  The fact that a 22-year-old had written such a luminous novel offered me hope that there was a way out of my own isolation. Not only did the story stick with me, the book shaped my life. It impelled me to spend my adult life as a writer.
B00005JMEW|5.0|There is no such thing as an original thought, unless it is taking stuff that's already been done and turning into something else, and to me, Tarantino is a master at this.  To me, this movie was so original(it is true that I have not seen the source material).  I thought the originality never flagged, and that I was truly watching the work of a person who knows and loves films.  This is high praise from me as I normally am not the hugest fan of hype, and Tarantino carries his hype around with him. I am also not a fan of gratuitous violence. I loved this movie.<br />As For the movie<br />I once saw Tarantino in the Burbank airport.  I got in a conversation with him and he was&quot;flying to Mexico to shoot his movie&quot;. The movie was called Kill Bill, and then he and I got on the same airplane.  He came across affably, a charming, funny guy.  I guess I might've been scared being on the airplane with the maker of Kill Bill if I had seen it.  This is a film of unadulterated revenge.  A woman is so set on revenge that she must fight armies of people to get to her goal.  Uma Thurman turns in such a wonderfully focused performance.  The other thing is that her intensity really motivates the gallons of blood.  She is a greek tragic figure whose horrifying acts are justified by her loss.  This is Medea, Titus Andronicus, and Switchblade Sisters all in one.<br /> and the work of everyone is so fantastic.(I am waiting to see Darryl Hannah get hers).  But the blood flows almost ridiculously.  Ultimately this is shakespearean, greek, grand opera, and 70's exploitation all in one.<br />And for all those of you who are complaining that this is not original,  I am not sure what you want.  To me, this is a hybrid of anime,(which I am not a fan of, but I thought it was beautiful and disgusting)pop culture, westerns, samurai movies and the value systems of those with no morals.  And you can never peg it.  Just when you think it is going a certain way, it shifts on you...sending you swirling into another style.<br />I really expected that I would not like this film, and I cannot wait to see part 2.  I can't wait to see what Tarantino has up his sleeve for usswirling into another style.<br />I really expected that I would not like this film, and I cannot wait to see part 2.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD edition of &quot;the greatest movie ever.&quot; It has 2 great commentaries, one by director Peter Bogdonavich &amp; the other by film critic Roger Ebert.<br />Also the DVD has the AMAZING 2 hour documantary, &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane.&quot; I basically spent an entire day watching citizen Kane: the movie twice (w/ and w/out Ebert's commentary) then the doc.<br />I think what makes this film the &quot;greatest movie&quot; is not only the film itself, but the history around it's release and the subject matter of the titular character and how the movie portrayed not only the real life media-mogul Kane was based on, William Randolph Hearst, but also the filmaker and star, Orson Welles. <br />The film was nominated for 9 Oscars but only won the best orig. screenplay. The short version of the story is: <br />Hearst was born a rich boy and became a SUPER rich boy w/ his newspaper empire in the early 1900s. Welles came to Hollywood from NYC after his famed WAR OF THE WORLDS radio broadcast in 1940. Welles was touted as a &quot;Genius&quot; by some papers and got &quot;the best studio deal in the history of Hollywood.&quot; Him getting all this attention and creative control and not having made 1 film pissed off a lot of people. After Welles tried to get his 1st 2 films made and they fell through he started making CITIZEN KANE based on the life of Hearst. <br />It was leaked Welles was making the film and Hearst used his many papers to destroy the credability of Welles during the filming. His papers made up stories Welles was a Communist. This and Welles' own egomania (he believed the 'genius' title) &amp; bad temper drove his reputation into the ground. CITIZEN KANE opened to limited release due to Hearst. After Heasrt died in 1950 the film started showing up on critics &quot;10 best films&quot; lists, eventually becoming the legend it is today. Welles never again got the kind of creative control or funding he got on KANE, his first andgreatest film.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Yep, Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;. The best selling album of all time. So what's the point of writing a review anyway? And it's worth more than 5 stars, I'll tell you that much.
B00014NE62|5.0|The various reviewers have said it all. So this is not so much a review as a personal testimony. I would just like to say how much I love this film. The first time I saw it was back in 1987, when it was released. Then, I didn't have the opportunity to see it again until recently, as a result of its being released in DVD, and I must say I was overwhelmed; even more so than in 1987, when I first saw it.I was particularly enthralled by the Cambridge scenes, but the film as a whole is flawless. The acting, the photography, the direction, the music are all excellent: the achievement of a team working in a state of grace.<BR>For those who wish to prolong the atmosphere of &quot;Maurice&quot;, I've just noticed that the soundtrack of the film (music composed by Richard Robbins) is available from Amazon (together with the soundtracks of &quot;Room with a View&quot; and &quot;Howards End&quot;) at a very reasonable price. It is to be found in the &quot;classical music&quot; section.<BR>The soundtrack is certainly optional, but the film isn't! Do yourself a favour, and add it to your collection!
B0000A36J5|5.0|Like the &quot;Fellowship of The Ring&quot;, this gift set edition of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; completely trashes the theatrical edition of this movie right into the ocean because of it's greater scope.<br /> In this movie, the remainder of the fellowship have gone their separate ways due to unfortunate circumstances. Two of them were lost. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee have now gone on their way towards Mordor and the Ring has gotten more powerful and Frodo has found it harder to resist it's dangerous power. However they have encountered the dangly creature named Gollum who once carried the Ring for over 500 years and has now aims to take back the Ring but Frodo and Sam who doesn't trust Gollum, have to trust him and Gollum guides them towards Mt. Doom. <br /> Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have now gones towards Isengard to rescue Merry and Pippin but are now find themselves towards the kingdom of Rohan where it's king has been withered by Saruman's power using the palantir. Saruman's army of Uruk Hai has grown massive and now numbers thousands of Uruk Hai and have been unleashed on Rohan. <br /> This gift set edition of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; completely trashes the theatrical edition right out of the water and into the recycling bin because this edition has over 43 minutes of new footage that was not in the regular edition. <br /> The third and fourth discs are absolutely amazing and contain unbelievable amounts of making of, story behind and all the stunning sets and all the work that was done to create them!<br /> This also comes with a statue of Gollum which is really cool and I love the packaging too and don't want to throw it away because it is so beautiful!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an exercise in character presentation and development.  As you probably know, there is little plot to follow, and no hair raising twists to shock you.  What you do have are two characters you have never seen before, yet you can probably identify with both of them a lot of the time.  Their platonic friendship is refreshing; it's so common these days for strangers to meet, feel attraction, and jump into bed for no reason except that it's in the script.  Because this movie chooses not to go that route, the characters are forced to show us their personalities on the screen, and that turns out to be much more entertaining than I expected it to be.<br />Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a series of ads for a whiskey.  He finds Japan strange; the opening scenes of the movie show him landing on his plane and looking at the culture shock before him.  He has a lot of down time.  We only see him working a few scenes.  The rest of the time, he is wandering through Tokyo with no direction whatsoever.  It is here that Murray's comic ability comes through.  He has done so many comedies that require a large amount of physical acting, here, the looks on his face are all it takes.  When he is in an elevator and he is a foot taller than every other man in there, he has a look on his face that evokes a chuckle.<br />Scarlett Johannsen plays a young newlywed whose husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer on assignment.  He is always working, leaving her alone to do nothing.  She wanders around, just like Murray.  Eventually they meet in a bar (which they both frequent often).  They strike up a friendship and spend lots of time together doing various things.  Murray is in his 50's and Johannsen is supposedly in her early 20's (although she is really only 18), which in recent cinema has meant a May-December romance.  But not here.  Both are married (Murray's wife calls and sends faxes asking him which color carpet he wants in the house) and there is a great scene where Murray tells Johannsen why marriage is tough, especially once you have kids.<br />It's not so much about the characters being &quot;real&quot; as I have seen from reviewers here.  It's about being able to identify with them.  I was able to see myself and alot of what I feel from the characters on the screen.  Kudos to Murray.  I found him funnier and more entertaining here than I have in a dozen of his comedies before.  Movies are not about special effects, or about shocking moments.  They have always been, and will always be about characters.  I found these two very interesting.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This Greatest Hits album is great.  It was great for me because it was the first Nirvana album I ever bought, and all the songs are great except for \\"About a Girl.\\"  This album wasn't just for money either despite what people may say, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl had been battling Courtney Love(...) for the rights to release this album with Nirvana's last recorded song \\"You Know Your Right.\\"  I don't reccomend this album to Nirvana fans with their albums already, but I do reccomend it to the newer Nirvana fans who just want to hear some great songs.
B000006OAM|5.0|If you prefer bubble gum pop this album is not for you.  The lyrics are powerful in both meaning and emotion and, as even her detractors must admit, her voice is beautiful. This Album may bother those that prefer thoughtless or silly lyrics but,if you enjoy thinking,then I strongly recommend Natalie Merchant's Ophelia! <br />   For those that find intelligent lyrics irritating, I suggest that you buy Bobby Mcferrin's &quot;Don't worry be happy&quot; song.  It's not bogged down with all that thought provoking stuff and it might make you happy.

B00005JKNC|5.0|This movie always makes me weep when Carrey gives his speech to the McCarthy-era committee. It speaks so much to what we're going through now with the Patriot Act, etc. At a time when I was feeling very upset with my government, it reminded me of just how patriotic I am and how much I love democracy and don't want to see it squandered. I think Carrey is wonderful in this film - his acting during the speech is filled with the proper subtleties of a man who is finding himself in the very moment he speaks his true mind for the first time. I love this film a lot! I would rather see a movie with flaws (although I don't think it has many) that has a message that moves me rather than a slick film with nothing human in it.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|All I have to say is, if you want a movie to put you to sleep, this is definitely IT! This film is perfect for the insomniac looking for a way to sleep without the aid of sleeping pills!  One of THE most boring movies in the past 10 years which somehow was able to receive quite a few academy award nominations. I don't recommend this movie.  It's sad because I think Bill Murray is such a talented comedic actor.   He has been so entertaining in most of his other films, just not this one.  There is only 1 laughable scene, where he is in the midst of making a commercial.  The dialogue between Bill and his Japanese director is priceless.  However, that scene alone is not worth the time it takes to filter through this boring story line.  Save your time and energy and see any number of his other movies instead.  You'll be happy that you didn't waste your time sitting through lost in the doldrums.

B00005JMEW|2.0|Like Pulp Fiction, the story is told out of sequence, but lack any of the witty dialog that made Pulp Fiction good. Tarantino film making is \\"borrowing\\" scenes from other directors/films and blending them into his own vision. His films are also usually interesting, and always sport quick and interesting dialogues. But they're basically popcorn movies, without any real depth of plot or complexity to the characters. <br />Tarantino delivers a film that struggles so hard to call attention to itself, and to its lack of originality. He has borrowed from an international grab bag of amusements, kung fu movies, spaghetti westerns, comic books, to build his B movie, and then drenched it in a bucket of blood. You almost expect their lips to move out of sync with the dialogue. <br />They should change the title to Kill Quentin. This movie simply did not ever need to be four-plus-hours long. By the time the last enemy is crossed off The Bride's list, you simply don't care all that much anymore. It's just Tarantino is paying homage to himself. Many scenes from would be far more interesting as filler on a Kill Bill extended cut with Tarantino commenting that \\"here's a scene I really liked but just couldn't use. Kill Bill is like a school paper were your the spacing and the font size turning a lousy 5 page paper into a lousy 10 page one.

This is especially hard to find in American films, foreign directors such as Federico Fellini or Akiria Kurosawa had the ability to do many times over.<br /> When \\"Master and Commander\\" was first released I didn't want to see it. It's not that I thought it was good to be a bad film, but it just simply didn't appeal to my senses. I wasn't until I noticed both of the critics for our papers here in Chicago placed the movie on their \\"top ten\\" lists that I decided to see it.<br /> \\"Master and Commander\\" is just a visual feast for the eyes. This is one of the few times I completely agree with the Academy. This movie deserved every nomination it received, well maybe except \\"best picture\\". But still, this is really an enetertaining film from beginning to end. The cinamatography, the sets, the production designs, visual effects, and the music, these are the real stars of the film. Without these things I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the movie as much as I do. All of these things come into place. They all add to the mood the film is trying to create. Almost everything here seems believeable.<br /> The plot in a movie like this really doesn't matter. The important thing to do is just sit back and relax. In fact I'm disappointed I didn't see this movie on the big screen. That must have been an experience.<br /> Russell Crowe plays Capt. Jack Audrey, a likeable captain who has the respect of his men. They soon find themselves under attack from a French ship. One that is bigger and has more men. That is a vague over view of this film. As I said the plot doesn't matter, I don't want to spend too much time discussing it.<br /> All of the acting is convicing. I found the relationship between Crowe and Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) to be very interesting. They are old friends and to me seem to be fighting for the other's respect. The doctor has no command on the ship but sometimes Aubrey listens to him.<br /> I've heard people say this is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far. But, this is a good old-fashion piece of Hollywood storytelling. Director Peter Weir has really accomplished something here.<br /> Bottom-line: Nominated for 10 Oscar, the film almost deserved every nomination. A perfect marriage for style and substance. Wonderful to look, but it also has a story. Believeable characters and situations mixed with visual eye candy make this a must see.the ship but sometimes Aubrey listens to him.<br /> I've heard people say this is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films they've ever seen.

B0001611DI|2.0|This is an absolute CLASSIC of the genre. What is it about zombies and the End of the World that fires the human imagination so? Is it the desire to strip modern life of all the detritus that encumbers it? (Phone bills, parking tickets, dead-end jobs, spam e-mail, etc. etc.) Or is it just the testosterone-fueled desire to blast away at anything that moves without consequences?<BR>      Unfortunately, while the film is great, this DVD version is seriously lacking. Odd omissions show it to be a rush job. Example: There are no subtitles. How are deaf people to enjoy the cannibalistic orgy of flesh-eating fun without subtitles? More heinous example: I COULD NOT find a copy of the disk that was not defective! I tried five copies. NONE would play without major skipping and data errors. (It's not my player either. I have a top-of-the-line machine and over 100 other disks that play perfectly. Also, the DotD DVD's wouldn't play on my computer drive either!) My complaints to Anchor Bay were ignored.
1592400876|4.0|This was a great book, but I'm not going to write too much in this review. I'm too worried about my punctuation. I read it last week and I've already forgotten half the misuses of which I'm guilty. Now, whenever I write something, I find myself feeling insecure about my punctuation all the time! 'Nuff said.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I stumbled on this dvd while looking for another movie. What an incredible story &amp; movie.  I watched it twice in one weekend &amp; have just purchased a copy so I can watch it again.  I'm not into &quot;horse&quot; movies, but the story and the characters just touched your heart.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALL TIME MOVIES!!  I hope to now read the book.  If you're tired of all the phony Hollywood junk ... check out this movie for the real thing.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|I love this album. It is a modern classic, it sounds like those great Paul Simon albums before he took up with the whole world music stuff. I have the greatest respect for someone who is making music like this today. He is a real song writer. This album has it all. t is also a very well paced album and it sounds like a whole package not just a bunch of songs. It is a stronger outing then Under the Cold Blue Sky but it is also very different in the ideas that it is projecting. Under The Cold Blue Sky still had the remains of the undercurrent of his roots and while there are songs on this album that hark back to his first outing (Dressed up Like...) here is the album where every song is gold. I love that someone is making songs that we can sing along to. It is not the kind of music that will challange you it will definately win your heart after one listen. It is one of those few albums that you will love the first time you hear it and it only gets better.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|It is hard to describe this film.  To do so would leave the other person somewhat bewildered as to why you would be suggesting they spend an hour or two of their life watching other people just hang out.  In fact, that just about does describe the film.  Set in Tokyo, a famous actor is being paid well to shoot commercials about whiskey, while being shouted at in Japanese.  In the same hotel is a young wife who is traveling with her photographer husband, and is left to wander around while he works all the time.<br />And?  Well that's about it.  Half the time while watching the film I thought to myself, \\"something did get lost in translation\\", because how in the world did this film get nominated for best picture?  Yet, the rest of the time I did get drawn in to the wonderful mood.  Life sometimes finds us in moments which create a whole lifetime by themselves. We find ourselves somewhere we do not really want to be, but when connections are made, we may not want to leave. Once back in our routine these moments may fade away, but while in them, we lived briefly another life altogether. This is the way the film \\"worked\\" for me.  I did not want the film to end, but yet I did not want anything \\"big\\" to happen either as that would have spoiled the reality.<br />Is the acting as good as people say it is?  Who knows?  I guess I really did buy into these people, as if it really was Bill Murray, stuck in a hotel and surrounded by glad-handling Japanese people, and connecting with this young woman in a friendship that is full of sexual tension which is thankfully never acted on.  So I guess the acting is sound in that regard.<br />Overall, I think this is a film that a person will either be drawn in to, or bored to death.  But for what it is, it does capture the emotions and mood of the moment well.  Like the characters it depicts, the audience may also get to live a another short lifetime in a Tokyo hotel.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|With his Pirates score, Klaus Badelt has impressed even his long time fans and surpassed his earlier works.  I've been a fan of his since his very early work (Extreme Days, K-19) and this is by far his best.  The music is as fun as music can be-thrilling, pulsating, and relentless in it's action packed score.  Every track is worth listening to because each one has a life on its own, but the last track is probably the best and most amazing, even if it is short (it would've been stronger if it had been a seven minute long suite to end the CD, but that's a minor quibble). People are saying that this is a rip off of Gladiator, but I can't agree with that.  I love Zimmer's score for that overrated movie, but this one is more action packed, more enjoyable, and all around a more fun score to listen to.  Even if you're not a fan of movie scores, you'll like listening to this soundtrack (which I feel was the only really smart element of the movie actually).  So go out and buy this score, believe me you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Imagine the television show batman, with the dynamic duo using swords instead punches. Well that sums up the last third of this movie. Kill Bill is a shallow patchwork quilt of campy gimmicks involving a lot of violence and even more redundant dialogue. Basically quentin takes the foxforce 5 idea thrown out by mia in pulp fiction and makes a whole movie about it, although the names are different and the characters are more sinister.  Uma is somehow supposed to be this Yank who's a superior sword wielder/killer, and manages to hack 88 or so Japanese men into pieces who have swords too, apparently because she has the great Hanzo's sword, specifically tailored for the mission she's trying to accomplish.  In reality of course, Uma wouldn't  manage to kill a single yakuza before getting chopped to pieces, but whatever the writer wants he gets, right?<BR>So anyhow, this movie manages to shock and appall with its quentin-esque violence, yet not have any depth whatsoever.  Probably good enough for the Anime nerds, but nothing that will be remembered in a year's time. Incidentally, I thought he did a really poor representation of Japanese culture, despite what Q's fanboys report. One saving grace is that he wasn't in the movie. THANK GOD
B00005O5CM|4.0|The title tells it how it is. I, myself, not being the 'Oh my God I broke a nail!' kind of girl, found it good to a certain extent. I think that Legally Blonde 2 is better, but don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend this movie!!
B00007LTIA|4.0|I think the real problem fans and non-fans have with this album (besides the obvious gripe about long-form songs from some listeners) is that this Yes is a much slower machine. Gone is much of the high energy, frenetic drumming that Bill Bruford laid down. Wakeman is also more low-key on this release. Using his boisterously arpeggiated patterns only minimally. <br />That said, I really do love this album. I always listen to it in it's entirety. I think you have to.<br />As long as you're not expecting Fragile or Close to the Edge you should at least enjoy it.
6305781427|5.0|If possible, choose the surround sound option to get the whole effects of this delightful music.  The DVD is the only place you will hear 'ARIA' which is FANTASTIC!!  Don't miss this.
B0001UZZWW|1.0|If this was in FS it would be a must buy for me. I have all the official DVDs made for the format and would have to buy this one, but red & Green? That was old before it was even invented, I can't sit for 5 minutes watching an Anaglyph format 3D film. Why can't they release both versions on the disc? IT'S A 15 MINUTE FILM!<br />I advise everyone to try out The Ultimate 3D Experience to see how good FS 3D is, and to boycott Red Green/Non 3D versions of films, unless they have an FS compatible version.
B00005JKJA|1.0|This was by far the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen.  I know a lot of people will try to justify the pretense of this movie by saying it's film noir and therefore quite artsy and above the average joe's comprehension.  Really, it's just a piece of crap trying to disguise itself as art. However, the movie did have some redeeming values.  Naomi Watts played her duel roles quite excellently considering the material she was given.   Also, the cinematography during the last phase of the movie was quite an enjoyable juxtaposition from the first half. Come on though!  Aren't you tired of being told to like something because it is abstract when you really feel like you got ripped off ?  &quot;Abstract&quot;  is an exploited term usually thrown on any piece of garbage not good enough to stand on it's own as a valid piece of art.  Frankly, I'm tired of it being used as an excuse for lack of quality.  This film reminds me of standing in a museum trying to figure out how a piece of string taped to a canvas is supposed to move me.  When you have to try this hard to make a movie seem good....well, do I really need to finish the sentence?
B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino broke out with Pulp Fiction because of it's innovative scene sequences and intermingling sub-plots. In other words, he tried something different and it worked. He tries it again with Kill Bill, inter-mingling storylines, and different scene sequence orientation. It's not as strong as an effect as with Pulp Fiction, but it works well.<br /><br />Kill Bill centers around a bride-to-be who was killed off by her co-workers for whatever reason (I'm hoping it's revealed in the sequel). But they fail, and essentially let her live. So her main motive of living at this point becomes 'revenge'. She attempts to track down all those responsible for her attempted death, and make them pay.<br /><br />True Tarantino style action and lots of blood. Tarantino pays homage to some of the old kung-fu films, as well as dips his hand into the japanese animation for a brief stint. It works, and seems to flow with the stroyline well. I highly recommend this film to any fan of his previous films, but keep in mind that it's not Pulp Fiction.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is great.  Her songs are very catchy and very interesting and I couldn't believe that she actually had a hand in writing this album.  Well, now, her voice may not that great and she probably wouldn't even be accepted by the American Idol judges (they're too random in their choices anyways) but she knows all the right connections to the songwriters.  Her voice is much better than most of the singers out there (especially the rappers and the screaming rock bands such as Linkin Park but I love them too.  I hate Christina Aguilera.  Her voice reminds me of a screaming diva.)  I really don't like Britney Spears personality but face it, a seventeen year old might like singing to children but I'm not sure a twenty one year old would.  I really don't may attention to what the lyrics are (what does Baby Hit Me One More Time mean anyways?).  I've heard worse.  Sometimes it sounds like people are just trying to jam words together.  Anyways,<br />1. Me Against the Music - I hated this song at first but now I like it. (10/10)<br />2. (I don't like this title)  Good use of onomatopoeia and good choice on the rappers. Very catchy.  (10/10)<br />3.  Showdown - The secong weakest song.  The chorus is too short but is still very catchy. (7/10)<br />4.  Breathe on Me - Good but not too great.  Good chorus but I forget how the rest of the song goes.  (8/10)<br />5. Early Morning - Why do they have her yawning in the middle of the song?  Hmm?  Why?  And how come she's not singing?  Good backup singers though. Uh... (6/10)<br />6. Toxic - It's sad how the radio can kill a song.  This is why the rock bands change every year.  They rely on being &quot;unknown&quot; to stay popular unless they are really good.  (10/10)<br />7. Outrageous - This song is outrageous.  It sounds like she's insulting herself... or R. Kelly was insulting her... (8/10)<br />8. Touch of my Hand - Why did they have to make such a good song for a nasty topic... I like the Asian instruments.  (I'm Asianand the sad thing is that she sings better than most Asians and if you say that's because Asians can't sing, I'll be hypocritical and call you a racist.) (9/10)<br />9. Shadow - I hate the body on this song but love the chorus.  Perhaps the song with the best lyrics.  (10/10)<br />10. Brave New Girl - It would be sad to see the bubble gum burst. (10/10)<br />11. Everytime - Good but I hope the radio doesn't overplay it. (10/10)<br />Oh yeah, I bet if she were black, people wouldn't be complaining about her.  America is racist!  They don't allow a white girl to try to be cool.  And if she were in a band either... not too many people complain about No Doubt.  No doubt Britney is better.

B0001I55OC|1.0|int he movie things happen almost randomly.  Subjects are explained in a matter of seconds leaving viewers completely and utterly confused.  If you like this type of movie you should read the book timeline.  it is so much better.  it explains everything.  for example it takes about 50 pages to perfectly explain how the time travel works.  in the movie things are also inaccurate.  some of the guys in the movie were really girls in the book.  events happened differently and it sucked.  i repeat this movie sucked.
B0001HLVSC|2.0|My husband and I bought this and eagerly sat down to enjoy it.  We found the noise level in the movie coupled with the heavy British accents made it impossible to understand what they were saying.  We are not old or hard of hearing, either!  This definitely detracted from our enjoyment to the point that we were glad when it finally ended.  The cinematography is exceptional.  The story was hard to follow (mostly because we couldn't understand the dialog).  If there had been subtitles it would have helped!  Maybe we are the only people reviewing this who had this problem, but I am reporting honestly our reaction.
0385043805|5.0|I had heard so much about rebecca but never really considered reading it .Finally irritated by all that i heard ,i picked it up and couldnt put it down ( it's true.. my sister even yelled at me)<br />This is a reallly awesome book as it stresses on characters really well.The name of the protagonist ( caroline) is given just once in the whole book( which is kind of exasperating) but adds to the period drama the best part is that the characters are entirely convincing.They are extremely well drawn especially those of Maxim deWinter , Frank  and of course, Rebecca.Even Small characters such as Ben, Bee and Favell do great justice to the intense plot.Most of all, the transformation of  the new Mrs.de Winter is truly reviving.This  book will keep you in susppense because it will take turns when you least expect it to and leave you yearning for more. Dont miss it! i recommend Jane Eyre and Pride and prejudice too!
B00000JCOV|3.0|one word can describe this guys. crazy. oh yeah and angry. so i guess theyre crazily angry. or angrily crazy. but how ever you look at it its the same. i would do a song by song review but they all kinda are the same with a few exceptions. theyre incredibly heavy and have so much more musical potential. joey is one of the best drummers ive ever heard, corey has an awesome voice and mick can play sweep arpeggios and play songs in harmonics and stuff but none of them can live up to their potential in slipknot. slipknot is driven by heavy percussion with exceptions like liberate. i think they need to turn up the guitars and down the screaming. this is one of the cds you scream to, not one that you like memorize all the songs and stuff. its alright.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Who are the people writing these reviews? Boring, follows the melody too much, diet-jazz.... This is what passes for listening in the USA? No wonder George W. Bush got elected!! This is without debate one of the finest jazz/bop/saxophone records ever committed to vinyl (now plastic in CD format). If you cannot hear the greatness in this music then you are either deaf or in spiritual denial. &quot;Cheese Cake&quot; alone is worth the price of admission. &quot;Love for Sale&quot; is equally wonderful. In fact every track is a classic. Dexter can burn like a super nova or glow like a coal fire. Who among the modern players has that ability? Perhaps Sanborn, perhaps Brecker but Dexter stands as a giant among sax players and this record is one of his supreme moments. Hear it and weep...then buy it without reservation.
B000001GMH|1.0|One thing is for certain:  the engineering of the chorus is far too recessed in this Previn re-recording.  That is NOT a minor issue to me.  It also sounds fairly &quot;slack&quot; and uncommitted.  Hardly jubilant where it needs to be.  Nor did I find the recording that wide-ranging either.  I didn't even care for the soloists who were largely uninspired as everything else.  Junk!  Better keep the earlier Previn, which was altogether a more sensual performance.  But my nod goes to Levine, overall...
0679441018|5.0|This isn't a stereotypical vampire novel, nor is it even similar to the 4 that come before it. Memnoch takes Lestat on a fascinating and thought-provoking journey through all of creation. This and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" are the best of the 5 original Vampire Chronicles - after \\"Memnoch\\", they start going downhill.
B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is a extraordinarily odd movie, which has very little in common with the earlier film, Night of the Living Dead.  However, simply recreating the oppressive atmosphere and dread of the original would likely have been near impossible and a bit redundant even if he had succeeded, so it's good that he moved it in a new direction.  Fortunately, despite the many differences, NotLD and DotD are similarly excellent.<br />Although they are very different, the basic plots to the first 2 films of Romero's trilogy are more or less the same: there's a zombie apocalypse, which forces small group of survivors to hideout in and barricade a building in hopes of simply waiting it out.  Now, however, the small farmhouse is replaced with a huge mall, and we are given an even smaller group of 4 survivors.  Overall the acting is pretty good, especially considering the budget it had.  The characters are generally fairly appealing, so long as they are intended to be, and they have a realistic ordinariness to them, much like they did in NotLD.  Despite the emphasis on violence and action through out the film they're some fairly powerful scenes just between the main characters.  There's a great scene of them hanging out in their nicely furnished apartment, listening to some sad Spanish/classical sounding guitar while they kill time by gambling with their worthless money.  It gives a great sense of desolation.  There's also an even somewhat touching scene involving the one character visiting someone's grave.(In fact, I think pretty much all the scenes involving that characters death are very effective, though I won't go into that so as not to give too much away.)  It's effective, as are pretty much all the best conventionally dramatic scenes in the film, because it's so simple and un-theatrical.<br />In my review of NotLD I urged new viewers to discard their expectations form modern horror films.  This is perhaps even more necessary for Dawn of the Dead.  Frankly, it mainly classifies as a horror film out of convenience, as it blends and shifts from horror to action to adventure to satire to straight drama.(It's rather reminiscent of the much newer and equally excellent 28 Days Later in this way.)  As for the classic complaint to all horror films, \\"It's not scary.\\" well, this one isn't even trying to be scary, for the most part. (And if you doubt this assertion, just listen to the commentary.  Romero pretty much says this is the case.) Still, it does have a few remarkably powerful and eerie scenes.  The raid on the projects is genuinely horrific, (if not scary in the conventional sense), particularly the slow extermination of the zombies in the basement.  There are some good scenes in the mall too, particularly when the guys go off to clear it out, and one zombie just stares at Fran through the glass and later, when the mall has been cleared out, but they all still hear the zombies rubbing and scratching against the glass, trying to get in.  These scenes are particularly effective as they come towards the middle, where it becomes more action/adventure/satire oriented, so they provide good contrast.<br />Much is made of the violence in this film,(done by gore legend Tom Savini) and not without good reason.  Despite the fact that it was released about 25 years ago, the sheer volume of gore shown in this film outdoes anything I've seen released by a major studio up to this day.(Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the only one that comes close that I've seen) Admittedly most of it is fairly dated, largely because of the blood (which is too orange and the texture doesn't seem right) but it still has a pretty strong impact a lot of the time.  There are something like 70 graphically portrayed gunshot wounds in the film along with plenty of melee violence and the requisite cannibalism.  The scenes of flesh eating are always pretty gross, particularly the zombie-man taking chunks out of his still living wife and the montage of mutilation and gut-eating towardsthe end.  It's also got a very nice and very sudden shotgun-induced head explosion. (If you really want gore, though, you need to check out the sequel, Day of the Dead. Actually, you should check that out either way)<br />Obviously, if you are disturbed or offended by graphic violence you oughta pass this up, though you probably already knew that.<br />Much is made of the satire in humor in this film, and while it is pretty effective, it isn't the emphasis of the film the some people would like to pretend it is.  That is to say, the film isn't simply a vehicle for Romero's thoughts on modern society and consumerism and whatnot.  That element certainly is there, but as a whole he mostly wanted to make an enjoyable film. (Once again, if you doubt this listen to Romero in the commentary.) Still, the satire is very important in that it provides a great contrast to the other elements of the picture.  This matters because these bizarre tone changes are one of the main things that make the film so good.<br />There seem to be some conflicting opinions about the conclusion where the film kinda tears apart, with an invasion of weird bikers and particularly graphic violence mixed with some odd physical comedy.  Personally, I think it works, and the humor and violence aren't just mixed randomly; it starts out more weird and lighthearted and steadily becomes more dark and gruesome.<br />This is a pretty bare-bones DVD, but it looks and sounds excellent.  Apparently there's gonna be a special addition later this year with a different cut (which is NOT a directors cut, by the way, just an earlier, formative one.) as well, and it'll presumably have more extra features.

B0000C8AQM|5.0|This soundtrack was awesome, but I wish they had included more songs from the movie instead of little clips of scenes from the movie. For example, \\"Back In Black\\" AC/DC, \\"The Wait\\" Metallica, \\"Smoke On The Water\\" Deep Purple, just a few. But the best tracks on this CD are...  Immigrant Song - It's a classic song, so how can you not love it. Also, Jack Black should make a cover of this song.  Touch Me - Jack Black singing this song is extremely hilarious, but this song is actually OK.  Set Me Free - A lot of people didn't like this song but I thought it was pretty good.    Well, if you burn this CD, you can add the tracks that the real CD is missing. That's what I did, and it just makes the cd... BETTER.
B000002B7U|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne is a legend not just in the metal world, but also in the entire music industry. Very few artists have managed to have the staying power which he has had. All the work he has ever done should be evidence of this as they are all great material. But, as with everybody, he has had an album which will be regarded as the best of his career and an album which will be regarded as his worst. Despite that I think all his albums kick ass I can understand why the Ultimate Sin is generally regrded as his least liked album. For two main reasons:<br />1. He decided to do the glam rock look and I believe he did it better than all the other glam rock bands, such as Motley Crue, Poison and Kiss.<br />2. Of all the albums he has ever done the Ultimate Sin has a number of tracks which sound the same as each other. Even Ozzy himself has admitted this and claims it is the reason why he won't re-release it. <br />A great album that is very underated. The Ultimate Sin is the best album featuring Jake E. Lee as the guitarist before Zakk Wilde took over. Not Ozzy's best, but neither is it his worst. I don't think Ozzy even has a worst.

I own all of her albums,and I must admit that none of the first could compare in the level of maturity and strength to this one. I am not saying that the previous albums were bad, they were great and I still like listening to them, but this one: track after track, they are inspirational, addictive, powerful and uplifting. One can sense and detect her anger, her passion, her sadness, her sassyness with each song on this magnificant album. \\"Heavy on my Heart\\" and \\"Welcome to my Truth\\" are especially essential, as they stress and bring to life her battle with breast cancer...Songs like \\"I Do\\" and \\"Where Do I Belong\\" as well as \\"Time\\" define her anger with some of the events that have touched her life in recent months as well as events that have touched and shook the world. The rhythm on these songs penetrates the skin and rides the waves of the blood in one's skin. They are truly captivating and stimulating. \\"Left Outside Alone\\" is truly the wisest choice for a first single, in its capacity and force it makes a more powerful single than previous picks such as \\"I'm Outta Love\\" or \\"One Day In Your Life\\". One of my favorites is \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum\\" - very clever and witty song as well as \\"Sexy Single\\", makes one wanna dance and sing....as I did, many times since I bought the record (in the shower) lol. Other songs? \\"Sick and Tired\\" is just unremarkable with the ethnic sounds that can be heard on the song, it adds diversity and versatility to the song. \\"Seasons Change\\" is a great opener for the album while \\"Maybe Today\\" stands as a very optimistic ballad, ending the album on a relatively positive note. Conclusion? DEFINITELY buy this album!!!!! This is Anastacia at her strongest, and trust me....once you start listening to it, you will not be able to stop!!! ENJOY!
B00012L786|3.0|Excellent old time detective thriller.  You never have a doubt as to what's going to happen, but getting to go along for the ride, makes it worth all the while.  Just the right bit of humour too...well worth adding to any collection.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I have to dig my way through this muddle of a movie. What is there to say about it? It's terrible, it tries to force chronological inconsitencies on us so that we can marvel at the sheer brilliance of the writers and the director, the writing is lazy, it tries to hard so hard to be cerebral that whatever plot there was is lost in an ocean of weak plot twists and bad acting. The concept is quite good, but the execution is disgustingly bad. I'm a fan of That 70's Show and I have nothing against Ashton Kutcher. It's just a BAD movie.
B0001Z363W|4.0|Some of these reviews are asinine. It would have been better if it wasn't titled BLS? Either way it is still freakin Zakk. How much more of the heavy BLS stuff do you want? It started to become repetitive with not a lot of new creativity. I have to give Zakk a sh*&amp; load of credit going back to the acoustic stuff because I think thats where he really shines and I hate it when fans try to pigeon hole an artist. Like &quot;your not allowed to do any other type of music because your last five albums were the same style&quot;. This cd really shows Zakk's talent,I kind of like BoS a little better because it has a bit of that southern sound but I'm heavily digging Hangover Music, sort of has a bit of a 70's feel to it. The only reason why I'm giving this four stars and not five is because I still think that Zakk has not created his five star CD yet. This guy just has so much talent which he hasn't unleashed as of yet. One of these days he's gonna nail it all on one CD.
B000002WPI|5.0|This cd is mos def one of the greatest hip-hop cds out there. These guys paved the way for all of the hip-hop artists out there today. You gotta cop it if your a real Wu fan. Tracks to look out for are &quot;Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothin' to F' Wit&quot;, C.R.E.A.M.,Method Man,da mystery of chessboxin', and &quot;Sham on a N****&quot;. All I can say iz cop this disc if you like real hip-hop.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I am not going to some the movie b/c everyone considering buying has seen it! In my work I get to advance screen DVDs (I have to give them back tho') so I can check out the extras and that's what I'm reviewing here. <br />Lots of deleted scenes!! Almost 45 minutes worth! No extra Hugh or Colin but the Liam Neeson father-son plotline is expanded and it becomes better understood about the Claudia Schiffer comment. Also, the installation at the art gallery is funny when you see how it came about. And egads! More naked people! <br />Also commentaries with Hugh and Richard and videos and such round it out. definitely wrap this one up and put it under someone's tree!
0920668372|4.0|This is a good book but the ending- you had better get a box of tissues- this is about the real \\"Circle of life\\" and how we take care of our children, and then how our children take \\"care\\" of us.<br />Very moving and emotional.
0064409422|5.0|The classic that started the Narnia ball rolling, \\"Wardrobe\\" is a rather simple story about four children (Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan) who find their way into a world where animals speak and mythical creatures are real. Once there, they help overthrow an evil witch who brought an eternal winter upon the world. Oh, and they meet a lion.<br />Lewis' writing here is geared strongly towards young children. He seems to delight in breaking the barrier between narrator and reader, telling the story as a storyteller would a gathering of kids. The style is effective in that it FEELS like a children's book, and in a good way; it's a great pleasure to read this out loud. While there are moments, however rare, when you almost feel talked down to reading as an adult, by and large Lewis succeeds in crafting a story that reads like a timeless fairy tale suitable for any reader who likes adventure, of any age. This also means \\"Wardrobe\\" may be the book in this series toughest to read for adults, if only because it has the most overly childlike-nature of the seven Narnia books.<br />The plot itself is simple, with few (if any) complexities and a fast resolution. The entire thing can easily be read in one lazy afternoon.<br />And then there is Aslan, the lion named in the title. This beast is at the center of the entire series, even moreso than the children who find themselves entering Narnia. What stands out as an adult (but is easily missed as a child) is the strong, overt Christian allegory. It is here in spades, right down to a faux crucifixion.<br />For many readers tuned into today's sensitivity to religion, or even offended by overt displays of religion, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" will simply be too heavy-handed in its religious allegory for adult readers. Not simply because of the Christian-influenced themes, but because Lewis simply beats you over the head with it. Every mention of Aslan and every scene with the lion gushes with an almost ferocious (and oftenuncomfortable) feeling that screams to the reader, \\"Rejoice!\\"<br />But to suggest that this detracts from the fun and wonder of the tale would be unfair. It DOESN'T. Only those sensitive to religion and the fervently anti-religious will have a problem with these aspects of the story. Others will just enjoy the ride.<br />As a children's tale \\"Wardrobe\\" is a fun romp through a mythic land, just the kind of wish fulfillment fantasy-loving children enjoy. And for that, I admire this book. Kids will love it - and so will adults. It's not the best of the Narnia works by any means, but it IS the first that should be read because it's the one that started it all. And as a classic of the genre this should be read by all, no matter one's religious beliefs.
B00000JCB2|5.0|If you're a relatively new fan of Limp Bizkit's, you'll find this to be a much different sound from what you're accustomed to. It's much more musical than anything else of theirs, and I really enjoy it a lot. <br />Melodic, well-written and at times beautiful, Significant Other proves to the world that Limp Bizkit is actually a pretty talented band when it wants to be. Anyone with a halfway decent ear for quality music can see, or at least acknowledge, that it takes ability to make some of these songs. Limp Bizkit isn't just a bunch of no-talent white guys trying to be thuggish, as evidenced by songs like \\"Re-Arranged\\" and \\"A Lesson Learned.\\" Yes, \\"Nookie\\" was a disaster, but just ignore that song and listen to the rest; nothing else on it sounds remotely close.<br />And believe me, I call a spade a spade. I think Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit are irritating these days. It's almost as if Significant Other was experimental, and they ended up not liking the sound of it or something. I'm not sure. Whatever the case is, I really wish they would drop the lame facade they've had going at times recently, and go back to making a more melodic brand of music like this album. It really is a great album that I think a lot of people can appreciate if they can get over their bias and just look at it as music. Hell, I don't really like anything else that Limp Bizkit has put out, and I wouldn't even consider myself a fan of theirs, just a huge fan of this album.
