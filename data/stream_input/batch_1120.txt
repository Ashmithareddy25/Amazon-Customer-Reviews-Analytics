1932907009|1.0|This is the cheesiest screenwriting cookbook out there, filled with \\"rules\\" that are nowhere to be found in countless great films but you can spot them very clearly in Hollywood's February releases.  It offers a very shallow understanding of how dramatic stories work.  For example, the opening image is apparently something REALLY IMPORTANT.  What was the opening image in The Godfather?  I forget.  Who cares?  What was important was the characters.  Then pages 30-55 are \\"Fun and Games\\".  Yeah, okay.  Then there's the \\"bad guys close in\\" section - I suppose you can rent The Graduate and find this section followed to a T.  FACE FACTS: The top screenwriters in Hollywood don't follow this formula any more than an NBA player practices his jump shot on one of those little baskets you hang over the door in your bedroom.  If you want to write a first script, try his method.  If nothing else, it's one way to try and write.  But as you get better, you will realize this is grade school stuff.
B0029LHWFO|3.0|The book arrived in a good time and is in very good shape.  I am just beginning to read it.
075640407X|5.0|I think this book is brilliant. Already on the first pages i immediately got a good feel of the characters and the environment. The language is great, the humor is subtle and the story progresses at a good pace. I can't wait to plow through the next books in this series.    I must add though, that i just finished wheel of time, book 10, a slow paced snail as there ever was, so my judgment might be somewhat of. But i still stand by the stars I've given, this is a good book.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|Patrick O'Brian writes like a 19th century author, and director Peter Weir catches an authentic sense of the time in this big-budget film.  Lovely photography, great costuming by Wendy Stites, production design is fabulous and very authentic.  Love this movie, which combines storylines from several of the O'Brian books.
0307454541|5.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO WAS A GREAT READ. I WAS NOT SURE IF I WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK BUT ONCE I GOT INTO IT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK BE PATIENT WITH THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS BUT BY THE THIRD IT MOVED FAST. I CAN NOT WAIT TO READ STIEG LARSSON'S  NEXT TWO BOOKS IN THE SERIES. I FINISHED THE BOOK SO FAST THAT I WISHED I HAD THE NEXT TWO BOOKS ON HAND TO START RIGHT AWAY.
0670022411|5.0|I am amused by the many reviews critiquing this book as if it is a fine piece of literature (particularly all the blather about whether Diana is a Mary Sue).  This is about vampires and witches.  It has some interesting historical aspects.  If one wants to complain about the pace or the lack of action, I can understand that (although I don't agree).      Even if this is not a great piece of literature, it is, in my opinion, very fun to read and pretty well written.  The parts in Oxford and France are particularly engaging and the scenery deliciously vivid.  I admit this is also the first vampire/witch book I've read so I have no basis for comparison, but I'd recommend it to anyone who is ordinarily turned off by the idea of this genre and who likes reading about history but isn't in the mood for a heavy period piece.  I look forward to the sequel!  Well done Ms. Harkness.
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|There is not much I can say about the Moshi MiniDsplay Port to HDMI Adapter. It works very well and was simple to connect my Macbook Pro to a HDTV for video out put. It says \\"with Audio\\" but did not get Audio via the TV speakers but only thru my laptop. So that is a bit deceiving in the title. I suspect they mean you can also connect your macbook pro to a AV receiver independently. That I have yet to try.
B002ZG99TK|3.0|This movie does indeed roll along like a freight train. Predictable but great action. Predictable but great acting from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. And the best part: the movie ran at just over 90 minutes breaking from what seems to be Hollywood's latest unwritten law that says movies need to run past the 2-hour mark. Thanks, Tony Scott.<br /><br />Scott likes the train business I guess and he brought Denzel with him again after they rode [[ASIN:B002LMV7Q6 Pelham 1 2 3]] together back in 2009. And it's funny....Either a major coincidence has occurred or Tony Scott said to Denzel, \\"Could you just play the same character that you played in our last movie?\\" Come to think of it, I think Denzel has played the same character in his last 20-something movies. Clearly the guy has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Unstoppable was all the way back in 1992's [[ASIN:B0045D3N3O Malcolm X]] (he played Malcolm X).<br /><br />I was definitely entertained by Unstoppable. Simple story: A careless accident causes a freight train to go on a runaway path unmanned and at full throttle. Washington and Pine are respectively engineer and conductor in the field who take it upon themselves to come up with a plan to stop the out of control train. And of course Denzel's corporate superiors, government emergency forces and the cops are all idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts). Director Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action as the mild mannered combination of Denzel and Chris Pine attempt to save the day.<br /><br />All in all, excellent rental but far from worthy of purchase for your collection. At minimum check it out when it comes out on cable or satellite.

It is one of courage, commitment, love and respect for values taught by a loving father to an amazing and determined daughter who, in turn, taught these values to her own children.

0061726826|4.0|This is a book that could easily be worth reading only for the premise. The dystopian concept that Lauren Oliver came up with is beyond fascinating. Every single time she describes the disease I felt my mind was blown a bit. I kept wondering if one can really miss love if you've never known it? Would you really live a dull-full life for fear of pain? As much as I think I couldn't, I think people who've been really hurt would say yes. Anyway, my point is that the world-building in Delirium was fantastic.    The writing, oh, the writing. Lauren Oliver has a gift with words. Such beautiful prose that this might be one of the most quotable books I've read. It's like a story made of poetry, absolutely stunning.    With that said, those who read my reviews know that pace is very important to me. I get easily bored. Specially if I'm reading dystopia, I like it quick. So the pace in this one was not my favorite. The ending was a very heart-pumping fast pace, but the rest of the book was slow to me. It could be due to the fact that I was not really feeling the characters either. They didn't stand out or do anything other than think. There's not much character action in the book, so there was little character depth. Neither Lena nor Alex have any personality traits that I can think of. These things were a little disappointing.    Overall, I enjoyed Delirium and if you are a hopeless romantic and enjoy beautiful prose this is the book for you.
0882709194|1.0|Ray Comfort's contribution to this edition is a 50 page Darwin smear that he pasted in to the beginning.<br /><br />Here is my summary of Comfort's introduction: Darwin was a jerk.  He must have been buddies with Hitler.  Therefore evolution is false, the world is 6000 years old, god created all species as-is, then destroyed most of them in a flood, and he loves you and wants you to believe in him so that he doesn't send you to hell.<br /><br />I recommend against buying this edition unless you want to help fund a knowledge vandalism campaign.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|I made the decision of buying this boxed set, despite reading the customer reviews on here about how much everyone hates the boxed set. And you know what, I bought it and I think everyone needs to get over the 'there is no individual packaging' part. This is a collector's edition. Personally, if it had separate dvd cases I don't think I would take the measures to keep it in as good condition. This is a great boxed set with all three movies with the blue-ray, dvd, and digital copise, plus a bonus features dvd. The box itself pays homage to the toybox that Andy has, and they're placed neatly inside.     If the lack of cases is truly something that bothers you, I'd suggest buying the jewel-cases for CDs, which fit quite nicely inside the box. Overall, buying this was a good investment and very inexpensive in the broad spectrum.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Two Americans and their Icelandic traveling partner take a trip through Eastern Europe to party it up in a remote hostel in Slovakia, where they are drugged and kidnapped only to be sold off to an elite hunting organization that specialized in human torture. After a mediocre debut with CABIN FEVER, Eli Roth burst onto the scene in his sophomore effort HOSTEL, a filthy throwback to the Exploitation films of the 1970's that solidified his name in Horror.<br /><br />HOSTEL, along with other so-called 'torture porn' titles like SAW or THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, has uniformly split Horror audiences based on its use of torture as a main form of entertainment. To say that Roth simply looks to shock and disgust is to grossly misread the entire film in the same way that many critics have dismissed TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE for being too violent. HOSTEL is far more reserved than any of the films that it is most often compared to, and Roth uses implied violence and terror much more often than he does gratuitous gore. Most of the torture sequences are shot off-camera or in cut-aways, leaving the viewer with the victim's twisted facial expressions or screams of anguish. That isn't to say that there isn't gore, because there is, but the gore is only used to accentuate the scenes, and not to define them. True horror always falls secondary to terror in HOSTEL, though this fact is commonly overlooked.<br /><br />The characters of HOSTEL are another brilliant selling point. These are teens that anyone can relate to, and by working outside of the studio system, Roth is able to write his own fluid and naturalistic dialog without the fear of self-censoring himself for political-correctness. This may lead to some questionable vocabulary, but it lends credibility to his characters. In an interesting twist, Roth has given his male leads distinctly effeminate qualities while he victimizes them in the same ways that most female characters are typically treated in this type of picture. People who appear on the side seem inconspicuous and harmless, which allows the audience to let their guard down along with Paxton, Josh, and Oli as they are lured deeper into the lion's den. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are two fun, energetic, and utterly believable characters that draw out a purely empathetic response from viewers that have fully invested in them from early on in the film.<br /><br />Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the mystery behind the sinister organization, itself. Virtually no information is ever revealed about the group or the men that support it, which makes the entire situation that much more intriguing and terrifying. In a genius move, Roth would go back and fully expose the Elite Hunting Group in the film's sequel, even if the attempt was unable to recapture the success of the original.<br /><br />On top of everything else, HOSTEL is a huge crowd-pleasure. Roth caters to a very specific audience, one that revels in gorgeous naked girls and bloody set-pieces. He delivers on every intended level, with a script that is both hilarious at times and painfully excruciating at others. The greatest payoff comes during the revenge sequences, where Roth creates genuinely out-of-your-seat excitement as his characters get their payback against the people that betrayed them.<br /><br />Eli Roth is a Horror fan at heart, and it shows. Though he may have trouble topping this second film, it is obvious that he has a clear control over the genre, and that he has the potential to become one of the next generation Masters of Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesseem inconspicuous and harmless, which allows the audience to let their guard down along with Paxton, Josh, and Oli as they are lured deeper into the lion's den.

0756404738|5.0|It's hard to write a review after reading a book like this. It's like reviewing a sunset after a spring storm. Yes, that's a poetic image, and that's what Rothfuss does to your brain. I plan on selling all my worldly possessions soon and devoting my life to chasing the wind...<br /><br />But meanwhile, I'll try to do this book justice. It starts much as Name of the Wind ended, with Kvothe still a 15 year old at the University. It spends about 300 pages in this mode. Kvothe has a handful of new adventures at the university and tells us much about his classes and his never ending pining over Denna.<br /><br />At this point it's good to make a, um, point. The Kingkiller Chronicles are not about the main storyline, i.e. Kvothe discovering who killed his parents, why, hunting the killers down, and avenging them. Many readers will no doubt be impatient at the amount of time Rothfuss spends describing seemingly unimportant side adventures of Kvothe's. The book is about how a man becomes a legend. What would seem to be the main storyline is just as incidental as all the rest. It's nice to have that main plot line running through the many hundreds of pages of his adventures, and it does give Kvothe's life a bit of a forward thrust. But that is not what the book is about. So if you read this series hoping to get a page turner as he chases down the Chandrian, then you may be disappointed. (Though it is still a page turner).<br /><br />This reminds me of when Kvothe tells a story to his two friends. At the end of the story they're a little confused because the story didn't follow the familiar pattern they expected. Then Kvothe explained that he had told them a story that his people would tell each other, not a story meant for a general audience.<br /><br />I wonder if there is a message from Pat in this.<br /><br />Instead what we have is a man at the end of his life, or what he hopes is the end of his life, recounting how his legend was born. And that legend is built of pieces. This book gives us some of those pieces.<br /><br />He eventually leaves the University for most of a year. Rothfuss deftly skips over some of the more irrelevant side adventures, a trial and a shipwreck, and stays focused on those things which begin to build Kvothe as a person - his training, battles, moral decisions, role as a leader.<br /><br />Kvothe is a bit of a contradiction. On the one hand, no matter where he goes, he's always a fish out of water. He's always the different one, the outcast, the landless, lowborn Edema. On the other hand, he's able to adapt wherever he goes, no matter who he is with. He can find a place anywhere. This contradiction is brilliantly balanced by Rothfuss, and we see that perhaps they're different sides of the same coin. His freedom gives him nothing to lose.<br /><br />The strength of the book, though, is probably the sheer poetry of its prose. I don't think I've ever believed magic was as real since maybe watching Star Wars and the force for the first time as a 5 year old. I've often had difficult conversations with friends who were of a very strict, scientific and rational mindset. Trying to get them to accept the truth of other ways of seeing the world has been futile. I think from now own I'll simply recommend this book to them. If they can understand how Kvothe sees the wind, then they'll finally know what I've been telling them. Rothfuss does a better job of describing the worldview of the slightly mad artist/poet and making it magic than anything I've ever read.<br /><br />This book, and the entire series, is destined to be a classic.<br /><br />I somehow survived the four year wait between books one and two. I have no idea how I'll last until book three.. This book gives us some of those pieces.<br /><br />He eventually leaves the University for most of a year.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|Barbra Streisand has always been the best at what she does. This collection of concerts was amazing. The Fort Lauderdale concert was so well done and so reflective of her magical voice. For those who have never heard her sing, it shows what a phenom really is. For those of us who grew up with her work, it can bring a tear to your eye as you go down memory lane. She takes time to talk to laugh with the audience between songs. It's a nice way of letting new and old listeners get to know her. This could be the best and last \\"Barbara\\" concert ever recorded so I recommend getting this collection. I liked it so much I bought one for my mother. It's a great gift for those hearts you wish to touch.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Despite his best efforts, Ed Wood's name has become synonymous with terrible filmmaking, but now, Tim Burton gives the quirky and ambitious director his moment in the spotlight! ED WOOD is both sad and uplifting, and shows the best and worst sides that Hollywood and stardom have to offer. The comedic tale follows poor Ed as he struggles endlessly to live out his dreams of directing movies that are filled with action and imagination. His biggest failings lead him to chance encounters with genre legends Bela Lugosi and Orson Welles, who continue to inspire him even when all hope seems lost. On top of everything else, his love for angora sweaters and cross-dressing continue to set him back both professionally and personally. If enthusiasm had only equaled talent, Ed Wood may have become the world's greatest director, and Tim Burton is sure to show it throughout this heartwarming tragedy.<br /><br />Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood in a stylized but highly entertaining exaggeration of the character. He delivers many subtle nuances to the role that make him pitifully naive and endearing at the same time. Depp is joined by a talented cast, including Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as his two love interests, Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray as his kooky cohorts, and Martin Landau in an Academy Award-winning performance as the tattered old Bela Lugosi, with whom Wood would share a close friendship throughout his final years. Landau is fully deserving of all critical praise, as he is impeccable in the role and completely indistinguishable from the real-life Lugosi. Wood and Lugosi have many common bonds that draw them together, particularly in that they have strong motivations and inspiration, but that they are each critically flawed in numerous ways.<br /><br />The characters are drawn together in a colorful story as Wood brainlessly cons investors into supporting his artless productions. Their adventures lead them into unbelievably funny situations where they are run out of studios and left out to film in the dark without sound or working props. Burton capitalizes on the most outrageous moments of Wood's career, but equally balances the silly humor with dramatic lulls to link the film with reality. The uncanny reproductions from films like GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, and (of course) PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE are pulled off flawlessly, as are the casting decisions for side characters like Vampira and Tor Johnson.<br /><br />ED WOOD is essential viewing for all movie fans whether they are familiar with the character or not. It encapsulates the entrepreneurial spirit of the independent filmmaker and the inherent difficulties in following the golden road to Hollywood with more than a hint of satire. One cannot help but be drawn back to Wood's terrible films after watching this loving tribute!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesd left out to film in the dark without sound or working props.

B00151HZME|5.0|Shamefully unaware of the existence of the coded \\"m83\\" artist/band, I powered-on my Pandora station seeded upon the glorious Tears for Fears \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World.\\" I am certain, reader, you know where this is going. Following the usual lovely 80's-fare, a song dripping with synth-seagulls and muffled-esque vocals wandered along the player. I failed to look up instantly, continuing to focus upon my grad school reading at the time. Initially, \\"I don't know this 80's song,\\" was the only fleeting thought across my mind. As the unsuspecting chorus engaged, however, I could no longer ignore the calling. \\"What IS this?,\\" I strongly inquired to an empty room. I was almost angry that I did not recognize a genuine new-wave classic (PS - Yes, New Wave is a very real genre. End the debate). In viewing the little Pandora player, I was inundated by 3 lines of nonsense: \\"Kim & Jessie\\"; \\"m83\\"; \\"Saturdays=Youth.\\" Research ensued, uncovering the jarring reality that this was, indeed, a CURRENT band.<br /><br />Following a brief MySpace listen, the purchase was on it's way. Subsequent to receipt of tangible CD (yes, I believe in those, too), the tunes nary left the headphones or space of my experiences. Do any of you recall those formative albums, where the listen ushers in instant transportation of nostalgic times? Akin to the the way the scent of apple-cinnamon takes one back to grandma's house as a child, certain albums were crafted with such heart and thoughtfulness that they capture the spirit of one's life transition of the time. Remember those? Think: Songs from the Big Chair for my childhood,  Vitalogy  for my tweens and high school, Dashboard for college, and Copeland's Eat Sleep Repeat for the post-college years. While I could go on, the instance remains rare. Well, at 27 years of age, it occurred again. The reminiscent synth and verb of yesteryears came to color and shape the years of current. Consequently, m83 (along with the Album Leaf) captured my grad school years.<br /><br />If for some reason you have not heard this album, know little of this 'band,' fear not, I urge you. Careening through nostalgic keys and dream-wave melodies, this is NOT reminiscent of the 80's in a power-cheese manner. On the contrary, the album's return to the past teems with such heartfelt emotion, passion, and I-am-reliving-it-again memories that it works. Scratch that, it does not 'work,' it stirs the soul. New wave stirs the soul? Undoubtedly. While initially odd, the title of the album resounds well with the spirit of the album. Saturday WAS once the freedom of existence. The songs whisper to the heart's longings to the lost innocence of past. The album is, really, a lament..

0439023491|5.0|Like my review for The Hunger Games, I give this book 5 stars even though this is something I never do. I attempted to drag out reading this one as much as possible, simply to keep myself reading it. But it turned out pacing myself was difficult. This book is fast-paced and right on target with the first one (although I will say, I enjoyed the first one better for some reason). I loved the development of the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, and how it parallels the progress of the rebellion throughout the book. How, unlike in the first book, Katniss became willing to sacrifice herself for someone else (other than Prim), and was bent on saving Peeta no matter the personal cost to her. I liked that we got to see more of her friendship with Gale, and how her life changed since the Hunger Games. Even the new characters like Finnick were so easily accessible that you immediately have an interest in them and find comfort in their presence, even in the most grim of settings. And of course, the end just leaves you wanting more. READ.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Item received quickly and in pristine condition.  Was a birthday gift for my daughter!  Thank you very, very much!
0316077054|3.0|I guess lets start with the good things.  The story itself is a good one.  I love the Caster world that was created in the first book and having it take place in the south is brilliant.  It seems that the south itself is a character!  And in this book we also get to learn of more Caster characters.  Incubus, Keepers, Amma and the Greats.  Even a Wayward and Ethan's mom.  Her presence was wonderfully written.  The characters of Ethan and Link are fantastic!  They are best friends and play very well off of each other.    I guess my main dislike is the writing style.  The whole book seemed very choppy and a bit hard to follow.  I found myself having to go back and reread sections to make sense of them.  There were characters that would just happen to show up out of the blue in some time of dire need.  I know that can happen but it just felt forced and out of place.  In some parts there was just too much information and detail that didn't really enhance the story, it just added pages.  And then there's Lena.  I don't know of a character that's bothered me more.  Well maybe Bella Swan but anyways....  In the first book I really liked her but in this book she came off as whiney and selfish.  She's left her home to be with Ridley and this John character because she has to protect the people she loves but then just whines and complains and acts like a dark caster even though she was never claimed.  Ugh!  Let's hope for a better Lena in the next book and maybe a little bit more in the romance department.  But like I said initially, I love the story itself and will read the next book.

0439023521|5.0|I never give 5-star book reviews. Ever. Yet I'm contradicting that by giving one for this book, because this book is nearly flawless. I don't understand why it's labeled \\"for grades 7+\\" on some websites, because it is definitely NOT for people that young. Yes, it is gory, but the gore does not detract from the plot or the depth of characters. I am always looking for books like this, where the characters are all so well-written and unique and even the least relatable character makes sense. I know a lot of people have said they find Katniss cold and unrelatable, but that is so not the case. My only explanation for that is that those people didn't understand her. While reading all three of the books, I found myself actually thinking I have never identified with a character as much as I do with her. Maybe that makes me cold, but I don't care. Because I love her. I love Peeta. I love all of the main characters in these books (yes, even Haymitch, for anyone reading this who has already read the books).  And the plot is so unique and developed that I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book for weeks. It stays with you. I have even made the most random comparisons between real life and the world in The Hunger Games, the Capitol, and Panem itself. It's really hard to explain, but in a good way. I just finished the third book today and already want to start reading the whole series over again. Needless to say, I'm slightly obsessed. READ IT; don't just wait for the movies.

It should have won more awards at the Oscars...just came in too late in the year to have the chance for proving greatness. Had a lot of compitition and should have been given more recognition. I would give this movie 2 thumbs up and great for kids to watch. The only negative was using God's name in vain during the beginning of the show. I believe all movies should remove that from their choice of swaring.
0439023513|5.0|Again, 5 star review from someone who doesn't give those. I don't know why people are so upset about the end of the book. You absolutely cannot go into this book expecting a perfect happily-ever-after ending, because that has never been what these books are about. If you read the first and the second ones, you have to know that people are going to die and things are going to change and nothing is ever going to be perfect. But the conclusion of this series could not have been better, in my opinion. The depth of the parallels between the Capitol and the rebellion against it, from the capturing of innocent lives to use them as game pieces, to the literal idea of the \\"one last Hunger Games.\\" It shows just how far people can go to get what they want, even if it means doing exactly what they're rebelling against. I feel that the younger readers of these books may not have caught all that, so their focus was on the very end, with Katniss's relationships with Peeta and Gale. I'm not going to give anything away, but I was extremely happy with her choice. If you thought she should have chosen the other person, you need to read the whole series again. She explains exactly why she knew this person was the right person-- how it HAD to be him, no matter what happened. Yes, the relationship with the other person could have been salvaged a little better, but it could never be the same after Katniss realized what he may have done. Like he said, she will always be thinking about that. Other parts toward the end were sad as well, but who doesn't expect sad from a series of books about children being forced to fight to the death for the amusement of people in power? It's not a light subject matter. Nobody's death was in vain, and that was kind of the whole point.  Don't get me wrong, I do view it as a happy ending. I just think people are exaggerating the extend to which it should be happier. Read it, but expect some things to turn out differently than you imagine; it wasn't written byyou or me. It was written by the same person who wrote the other books with which we fell in love.

0316098337|5.0|\\"Room\\" is a novel of tremendous originality and poignancy. As a boy of five who has lived his entire life in captivity with his kidnapped mother, Jack's life in Room is his \\"normal.\\"  His Ma uses her considerable creativity to devise games to teach him and encourage him creatively, without letting on that the things they read about and see on TV are real and just waiting outside Room's metal door. Room is his entire world, and Ma does everything in her ability to enrich his life there, while shielding him at all costs from \\"Old Nick,\\" her captor who comes to visit most nights after 9:00, after Jack is put to bed in Wardrobe. As time goes on, though, Jack's curiosity and questions remind Ma that she can't keep shielding him from reality forever, and their life in Room cannot continue on indefinitely. She and Jack must combine their knowledge and creativity to come up with a plan.    I found this book fascinating all the way through. An adult novel from a little boy's perspective? High-concept, but it is brilliantly done. Although Jack is overall a happy boy, he is confused by the disturbing things he hears in Room when he is shut in Wardrobe after dark. Readers are gradually made aware of the frightening things that mostly fly over Jack's head because he thinks they're either normal or part of a dream.     Although the turning point of the novel occurs about halfway through, I don't agree that it loses steam thereafter. After this point in the book, one wonders what could possibly happen next, but it turns out that the major event midway through the book creates many additional challenges for both of the main characters, making the whole thing a riveting read. As for the criticism that \\"Old Nick\\" is an underdeveloped character--that is just not what this book is about. It's not about the backstory of a predator, it's about Ma's love for her son (and vice versa) and the challenges that Room imposes on both their lives. Jack is telling the story and he'll tell you allyou want to know about the pictures on their walls, their craft-friends Eggsnake, Labyrinth, etc., but since Ma protects him from having to see or speak to \\"Old Nick,\\" Jack only describes the bits and pieces he sees and hears at night.   You won't be able to put it down. Read \\"Room!\\"
B0049OSQ18|4.0|I bought this album after seeing the band being advertised on xbox live and did not think much of the band at the time. Well, a few days later i was on Itunes and previewed all the songs multiple times and knew i just had to have it. I ordered the album and within a week it arrived and lo and behold the sound quality was just as good as it was on itunes, if not better. From the ringing acoustics to the harmonicas and various other instruments this album truly stood out for me acoustic wise. Colin's voice on this album sounds superb and truly delivers in this collection of songs. A few of the key tracks that stood out for me were Rox In The Box, Calamity Song, and Dear Avery. But that is not to say that the rest of the album is bad. It is far from that, with every song bringing a different theme to the album, it all blends together nicely creating one of my favorite acoustic albums thus far. If you are in the mood for a new fresh acoustic album i would personally recommend this one to acoustic lovers.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I have only used a couple of these batteries and so far they work fine.  When I purchased them I was suspicious that there might be something wrong because they were so inexpensive (5 for less than the price of 1 most places).  The date on the batteries is 2015.  So, based on my experience so far they are great.
B000UR9T82|4.0|The movies were transferred to blu-ray well. The movies are enjoyable as everyone knows except for the third movie. The third movie did not feel as cool as the first two. Whatever happened to all the special features on Spiderman 1 & 2?
B003L77GG0|5.0|To me the show went from slow to fast and great, been waiting for this season to come out, I have now all of the seasons and i cant wait for this one to come out, I am tired of commercials and not being able to see the whole show. I get so into it and then bang a commercial boo. I think if you want all the shows you have do some shopping because sometimes you can find the show for cheaper if you know which store to shop at and if it  goes on sale get it, great show and it will be missed, I hope the stars do well when she go off the air  good luck and hope it comes soon

B004A8ZWSS|2.0|A few disclaimers:<br />1.SPOILER ALERT--this review includes spoilers, especially the most important one that the plot revolves around.<br />2.I don't care for action movies, especially the ones that are strictly for the sake of blowing things up to sell tickets, etc.--mindless action movies with little plot, in other words. So the lack of that, or sex, or profanity, is not why I didn't like this film. It's fine if a well-done, quality film has contextual action in it, though.<br />3.I adore Johnny Depp and think he's the greatest actor around today, or ever, actually. He was born to act. I loved him in this movie--yes, I'm also somewhat biased when it comes to him, I admit--but I'm totally objective when it comes to his movies. There are a few I don't like at all, some that are good or just OK, and some I dearly love. But this movie isn't one of those, unfortunately:<br />I give it a 5/10. When I first heard Johnny was going to do this, I had two immediate reactions: 1) YAY, he's finally doing a movie with AJ--who I firmly believe is his female counterpart in the looks department. And 2) This movie doesn't seem like his usual style, and it seems kinda....beneath him.<br />So I was curious to see if it would stand out above the usual formula chase 'em/plot twists and turns/who's really the criminal and who's not suspense thriller genre flicks, of which To Catch a Thief seems to be the standard by which all the subsequent ones go by, and of which some are awful and some--like North By Northwest--are great.<br />This was lacking in atmosphere, continuity, dialogue, plot...I could go on. It was way too slow and draggy in places, and the lack of ANY sizzling or even halfway interesting dialogue between Johnny and AJ truly astounded me, except for the very end, which seemed to be a very clever and funny 'inside joke' that probably only the Depp fans who right-click-save their fingers off to try to capture and own every picture of him they possibly can off the internet,because of his true beauty, would understand.<br />I was disappointed after seeing this movie--the plot was contrived and skewed, like the confusing train scene, for one example---DID she know or just suspect (or neither) that he was Alexander, or had they had that set up from before so that it was only the audience that was fooled? Because something she said then led me to believe that she did know--when she said she didn't like the name Frank, and that they would find him another. That could've been code to him for 'Why would you pick THAT horrid name?' in case any of Shaw's thugs or the police could hear them talking or had their booth bugged. But whether she knew it then or not is something the audience will never know, since it wasn't ever explained or answered in the movie.<br />Some of it was blatantly contrived, like when she showed up from out of nowhere in the canal in the middle of the night to rescue him--like the knight in shining armor on a white horse. The question that immediately came to mind was 'How did she know he was there, in danger?' Unless she'd been watching him from the moment he was taken to jail earlier that day, which was unlikely.<br />Paul Bettany did his usual stellar job, even though his part was less meaty than Johnny's or AJ's was. And the scenery was authentic, which is a nice change from CGI and green screen, etc., and gorgeous, like it's male lead.<br />This movie was akin to going into a banquet room expecting a feast, and coming back out 2 hours later still hungry. I'm still wondering why Johnny did this movie, and also wondering if the low quality and dialogue was what all the laughing was about that the cast did during the making of it, because some of the corniness in it actually embarrassed me.<br />But of course, die-hard Depp fans like me will have to own the DVD.
0670022411|2.0|Duped and Disappointed    I liked many aspects of this book.  There were vampires, witches, gay witches, daemons, history, science and some romance - overall, it had everything to make this a great read, but it wasn't.  Sadly, it lacked two important components - editing and an end.       At times this novel went on, and on, and on about things that didn't add to the story line.  You could have probably skipped entire chapters and still not missed much.  The main character's romantic interest gets boring - I don't think a book needs to have graphic sex scenes, but they are \\"soul mates,\\" married, crazy in love and don't have sex - I don't even get that.    As the book slowly moved along, the plot started to be defined and I became engaged and anxious to see how everything ended.  Guess what?  It didn't; it was like someone said: \\"O.K. we have enough pages, stop there.\\"  Nothing was resolved; all the plot lines remain in limbo awaiting her sequel.    Sorry, I'm not getting duped twice.  After putting that much time into a novel I want resolution - it's O.K. to have some hanging threads to incorporate into another novel, but for goodness sakes, end the book. I don't think I will buy another novel by Ms. Harkness; I work full time, have a family and my spare time to read is precious - I feel like the author let me down for the sole purpose of selling her next book.
0385737955|2.0|Okay, first off, I would like to mention that I am a teenage reader, who usually enjoys dystopian science fiction.  However, I did not enjoy this book.  First off, I couldn't find one character I liked. I know they all had their memory wiped, but none of the characters showed a hint of personality, exept for the \\"bad\\" characters, who were just plain mean. I disliked Thomas, the man character, for being to passive or impulsive at times, and pretty much wanted to slap him everytime he opened his mouth. I also didn't like the other characters, mostly for them being so indecisive (one minute they hate Thomas and the next minute they risk their lives for his idea? not very likely).  The second reason that I didn't like the book is that the plot, however interesting moved vvveeerrrrryyyyy sssssllllooooowwwwwllllllyyyyyy.   The only part I truly liked about this book were the last 50 or so pages.  I give it two stars and a 3% chance of reading book 2.
B004A8ZWTW|4.0|I once saw that quote attributed to Jonathan Winters and it works for me and Jane Eyre.  Raise your hands all you guys who aren't English lit majors or otherwise had the book assigned and have actually read Charlotte Bronte's novel.  Me either, so although I've heard of Rochester for most of my sentient life, this very good movie was my first exposure to the whole tale.  And quite the tale it is.  Spoiler alert -- in the 19th century, people get their just rewards.  It sometimes takes longer than expected, is often not exactly as first promised, and is always, always circuitous.  But you get what you deserve.  And so with Jane.  Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the movie is making its star Mia Wasikowska, who I didn't realize was the daughter in The Kids Are All Right,  look plain.  She is a beauty and Jane's plainness is only accomplished through indirect camera angles and oblique lighting.  Hats off to the cinematographer for that and for the numerous scenes of the moors' beauty.  Director Fukunaga tells his tale with fluid, occasionally confusing flashbacks.  He has Judi Dench on board as Rochester's housekeeper, always a welcome if sometimes hammy development.  It takes the better part of an hour for Jane Eyre to launch, but once it does, in a scene where Jane causes Rochester's horse to start, throwing him, all the rest is very entertaining.  And enables me to continue to miss the book.
B003P2WO5E|2.0|I tried to like it. But it just isn't what I had hoped it would be, or, what it is touted to be.<br />To compare this to anything written by Robert Jordan is misleading. You cared about Jordan's characters as he slowly let them develop. Sanderson jumbles them in, mixes them up. Toss in a world that is just as confusing and you get a miss-mash of short stories thrown into a giant volume that is to be ten books long.<br />As much as I liked Jordan's series, it was just too long, and Sanderson should have learned at least that lesson from him.
1592220045|4.0|Please note that the Meisha Merlin hardcover edition (2003) has interior illustrations by Janet Aulisio, worth the extra money. Each story has at least 2 or more illustrations, some full page.    -- Seattle
B004H4XI5O|2.0|Don't get me wrong because of my rating's more if you understand that this is not a self help book, intending to improve your memory. Joshua Foer himself confessed in the interview that he still forgets where he kept his keys or where is his car parked. Those of you who are buying this book out of talk show must be aware that these memory technique might help you if you plan to take some 'memory championship' or show amazing feat of memorizing cards in front of your friends. It was disappointing to see mere fleeting glimpses and references to memory techniques. The only memory techniques which it references are the 'Major System' & 'The Memory Palace', these are in fact covered in too many journals and studies and deserved to be accounted in detail. These technique require a lot of practice to pay off and are only advised to advanced audiences moreover they are based on easier techniques like individual orientation (like imaginary friends), mnemonic and pegging and an individual uses their own variations. Some where it makes sense too because firstly, it cannot be written in any book, you need to be fortunate enough to have an experienced instructor and secondly, it would have made book uninteresting to begin with.    I regret giving two stars and would still acknowledge the fact that this is still fun to read and has lot of interesting historic references, author did went beyond mere researching & instead dedicated over an year to practice them. However the book does not have original insight into the subject but author's account of interviewing various 'memory championship aspirants, memory fraternities & savants' that didn't made to the print. So be warned, especially if you are buying out of a talk show review, it is neither going to improve your memory nor go into any memory technique detail. You would do better by googling 'Major System' & 'Memory Palace' instead. The book does provide detailed and interesting account of how the author accomplished the amazingfeat in one year and may be worth reading for that alone.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This cartoon was great - funny, heartwarming, great dialog and voice cast was cool.  I enjoyed it almost as much as \\"Despicable Me\\". Would definitely recommend to both kids and adults alike.
B001NHNG64|5.0|What a great book. I would put Jack Reacher up against Jack Ryan, Dirk Pitt, or Scott Horvath any day. If you like them, jump into this series.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|If you liked the old Bruce Willis actions flicks, you will love this movie.  The dialog is funny, the cast is fantastic, the storyline is bearable, and the result is worth the rental.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is incredible.  I looked at bags that cost 3 times as much and they are not any better.  The bag is fully padded and durable.  I can easily store my DSLR camera, two other lenses, a point and shoot camera, chargers, cords, etc,etc.  There are lots of pockets for accessories.  I can use it as a bag or backpack.  It fits easily in the overhead compartment on an airplane.  I can't say enough about this bag.

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|After all these years, what more can one say about Psycho?  It is simply the scariest movie ever made.  I saw it in the movies when I was ten years old and now, 50 years later, it is still terrifying.  I previously bought it on DVD.  However, now with the 5.1 sound and improved blu-ray picture, I've purchased it again.  And it was worth the price.  The picture is great and the 5.1 audio tremendous.  You can really hear that water coming down during the shower sequence and the rainstorm that brings Janet Leigh to the Bates Motel.  There are numerous special features including a long Making of Psycho retrospective (on the DVD as well. )  There are two new extras: a short entitled \\"In the Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy.\\"  This is excellent.  There is also a special feature on the creation of the 5.1 sound heard on this blu-ray.  I also listened to the audio commentary by Stephen Rubello, author of \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho.\\"  The commentary is excellent.  It is such a pleasure to hear an audio commentary by someone who knows what they are talking about.  I particularly enjoyed his little anecdote about how overjoyed Hitchcock was with the performance of Simon Oakland as the Psychiatrist who explains what has been happening, near the end of the film.  I thought Oakland was great and have always enjoyed that scene.  Apparently Hitchcock got up from his chair after the sequence was completed and shook Oakland's hand, telling him that he had saved his (Hitchcock's) film.  I always find anecdotes like that interesting.<br />If you have never purchased Psycho before or never seen it (if thats possible,) then this blu-ray version is the one to get.  It is one of the most famous, frequently discussed and debated and most freightening films ever made.  It still holds up today and will probably hold up forever.  I heartily recommend it.  And remember to watch it with the lights out.
0823004325|4.0|I saw this book some years ago and finally broke down and ordered a copy March 2011. It seems to me that the printing quality has gone down. The tonal range of the b&w reproductions is really murky. Like they took a copy of a copy and printed it on really cheap paper. It's still a useful book and you can try to get better reproductions of the the famous art work elsewhere. If your in a used bookstore and run across the old hardbound earlier edition, get it instead. Whoever was in charge of quality control needs a kick in the butt.    September 2011 - I just wanted to add that in spite of the above criticisms this is a valuable addition my art book library. No one book seems to do it all.
B004P02OJ6|1.0|Thought Russel being a Roman and all that this would be a good movie. Boy was I wrong. This movie OFFICIALLY sucks!
0061537969|5.0|I don't write reviews anymore - but this book demanded it. Don't have much to add that's not already been said, so I'll keep it short: read it! Youll enjoy it, share it, treasure it, gift it to kindred spirits!
B003UESJHY|2.0|I watched The Fighter last night. I believe the \\"white trash\\" family was so oversimplified/caricatured that it made them all look like their IQ's hovered somewhere around 70, just above the cut off for intellectual disability and definitely bordering on emotional/developmental disability. Anyway, Christian Bale's performance was outstanding... the only well written/played character in the movie. I had a difficult time keeping Mark Walberg's \\"Boogie Nights\\" character separated from his performance in this movie! Except for Bale, the movie was a disappointment.
B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|This is the first Motorhead album I have ever listened to.  I just bought it on a whim because I'm a huge metal fan and, for some reason, never heard Motorhead outside of Metallica's cover of 'Overkill.'  I have read some reviews saying it's the same as everything else they've done, but to me that means nothing because I haven't heard the other stuff.  Based on this album, though, I'm going to get some of their other stuff because this is a very good, hard rocking album from start to finish.  These guys don't mess around at all.  Lemmy's singing is very gruff and, quite honestly, not that great, but that actually ADDS to the quality of the music.  If his singing were more melodic, the songs wouldn't be as raw and gritty as they are...and make no mistake, these songs are raw and gritty...and GOOD.  No wonder this group has been around for close to 40 years and are a favorite of many other heavy metal bands.  Standout tracks for me are: Born to Lose, Brotherhood of Man, and Outlaw.
B002GJU54E|4.0|This pretty much follows Evanovich's usual formula, but it kept me entertained while I was confined to the couch with a sprained back. The only thing wrong was that there wasn't enough Grandma! The plot was a little thin, but that is par for the course. The farther into this series you go, the weaker the plot lines get. I miss the style of the earlier books in the series, where there was more character development and way more plot.
B004KB4RL8|5.0|Seriously, this album is great.  It is easily their best since Bill left the band.  Most critics' reviews land in the \\"B\\" area, and that's probably right on.  It's not \\"Automatic\\" or \\"Murmur\\" or \\"Fables\\", but it's pretty great.  Most of the haters say it sounds like they're treading old ground, which to me is not a bad thing at all.  A few critics noted that it \\"sounds like a greatest hits collection without their actual hits\\" - which is a great way to describe it, except I mean that in a positive way.  I felt like Accelerate sounded forced even though it was hailed as their big comeback.  This album sounds natural, flows well as an album, and shows the band neither afraid to rock out again nor afraid to play softer songs (despite all the Around The Sun criticism).  Well worth it.

0060558121|5.0|American Gods was such a gripping story that I started and completed the novel in a single night!  Afterwards I insisted that a friend read it, then she spread it along.  Of course I had to buy another copy, read it again, and spread it on to someone else.  I've since purchased this book 3 times and bought the audiobook.

B003LSTK8G|3.0|I learned more about CDO's and Credit Default swaps then I had from other books, but the editing was sloppy with may errors. If this review is suspect I will list the errors.  One reviewer called the participants greedy opportunists. I can't disagree with that. What I do disagree with is his contention that they should have alerted the government about what was going on and tried to stop the coming collapse, yet the  book details their failures to get anyone in the system to believe them. The collapse would have happened even if no one went short. Credit default swaps were not foisted on the firms, they invented them. Brooksly  Born tried at the government level to warn of the impending doom, and was mocked and ridiculed by Larry Summers: the \\"Legend in his own Mind\\". As of today he is still in denial that he was wrong. How could anyone convince him when he was in a position to prevent it. Tim Geitner rewarded the failures by giving them 100% on  the dollar. He wouldn't negotiate down to only covering %50 of their losses, maybe even 75%, 100% gave them all the signals they needed to carry on as  usual.    A better book would have included  the failure of the government to see the coming crash and do something about it, with the exception of the already mentioned  Brooksly Born. I also would have liked a better and indepth of who lost money in the end, those that the government did not bail out.    The rich get richer and everyone else gets screwed. It has always been that way and will always be that way. H.L. Mencken said that Americans get the best government money can buy. These people have enough money to buy several governments. We got a taste of how big these crisis will get in the future, though many other countries (no cheers for Canada)suffered from the same mistakes it will be nothing when economies and financial companies become more global and locked in international ownership and or agreements. The more they do business together the more the next balloonwill affect more people.    The genius of the rich and their ownership of one of the major political parties will ensure that the next crisis will be paid by someone other than themsleves
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Outstanding value is what Seiko offers and the SKX007 is no exception. Fit and finish is unmatched at this price point. I've been wearing this watch for about a month and the movement has settled in at about +5 seconds a day, well within specs for this movement. Solid end links would be nice with the jubilee bracelet but again for the money, I'm not complaining.<br />If a solid, reliable classically styled divers watch is what you're in the market for, this is definitely one to seriously consider.

1439102724|3.0|I'm one of Jodi's biggest fans.  I love her books and can't wait to read them.  This was just okay though.  I didn't like the way the \\"Christians\\" were depicted in the book.  It felt slanted towards the lesbian main character.  It also felt like she was going a little overboard to preach tolerance and that all family types are okay and it's all just about love.  There weren't the exciting twists or the edge of your seat drama like in her other books.  It seemed kind of predictable.  I just didn't fall in love with the characters.  I didn't really feel the chemistry between Zoe and Max or Zoe and Vanessa.  I also felt like the relationship between Zoe and Vanessa was very rushed.  After one month they were moving in with each other?  Then married?  then trying to use the embryos?  it was too rushed and just didn't flow logically.  The ending was predictable.  I would have liked way more details about what happened after the case.  More about Liddy and Max.  More about the Lucy situation.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Updated review 5/12/2011: 5 Stars to Artist and for the music.  NO stars for the particular $9.99 CD I received from Amazon/MusicStore2000!!    On March 15, 2011 I purchased the $9.99 Audio CD from MusicStore2000 thru Amazon Prime.  WARNING, This CD will ONLY play properly on a regular CD player.  When I just try to play it on my computer (a must) the sound is distorted and scratchy even with headphones.  Ripped tracks has the same defective sound.  I love the CD but the one Amazon (or was it MusicStore2000?) sent me is from Argentina, maybe that is the problem?  I suspect this 2004 CD was deliberately encoded to prevent computer usage as I know some were a few years ago, although there was no indication on the Amazon web page nor the CD jewel box text.  I like having a CD as backup to my MP3's, plus on rare ocasions I like to listen to original full quality CDs on my home stereo equipment.    I have returned the CD, if anyone knows of a CD version that will play on computers, please let me know?

0920668364|5.0|I don't get the negative reviews on this book. The book demonstrates the deep love a mother and son have for eachother. It's the most touching childrens book I have ever read.  Everytime my kids and I read the book we both cry. You might find that strange but the book  reminds us both of the great love we have for eachother and to charish every moment we spend together. The people that are criticzing the book keep on mentioning the part of the book were the mother holds her son as a teen, well remember this is a childrens book. The book is an overall symbol of love not to be scrutinized.

1416596097|5.0|After the \\"Horse Who Came in from the Wild\\", \\"A most wanted man\\" is yet another excellent spy novel, which makes one wonder how and if at all the British Intelligence ever dealt with the heritage of the Cambridge Five and Roger Hollis, codenamed \\"Elli\\". On a story of an illegal immigrant from Chechnya Issa Karpov, le Carr&eacute; explains methods of work of British and German Intelligence Services, which generally stay out of sight and attention of the general public.<br /><br />The main character, 23-year-old Issa Karpov, or Ivan Grigorevich Karpov, was born and grew up in Chechnya, to a woman who had been raped by a Red Army officer Grigori Borisovich Karpov. By the time Issa smuggled himself to Hamburg, Germany, he had already endured several years in Russian and Turkish gaols, and his only hope how to get freedom and a new life was to claim inheritance after his disowned father, Colonel Karpov.<br /><br />At first, Issa Karpov found refuge at Turkish immigrant family of local heavyweight boxing champion Melik and his mother Leyla. As an internationally wanted terror suspect, Issa soon became burden for the family, and the family eventually paid dearly for providing this hungry and ill stranger safe haven.<br /><br /> Issa Karpov's asylum case was taken care of by Annabel Richter, a 32-year-old lawyer from a prominent German family of lawyers and diplomats. When all other options how to hide Issa away from the authorities until his case gets resolved failed, Annabel Richter eventually accommodated him in her own apartment.<br /><br />Mr Brue, owner of private banking house Brue Fr&eacute;res plc, met Annabel Richer and her client Issa Karpov in a house of Turkish immigrants. This unusual setting was necessary because of the nature of Karpov's claim. Issa Karpov, alias Ivan Grigorevich Karpov, a son of Red Army Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov, was just about to make a claim for 12.5 mil USD loot deposited by his father in the Brue Fr&eacute;res bank at on of the so called Lipizzaner accounts.<br /><br />Lipizzaner accounts were set up in Vienna for Soviet crooks right before the collapse of the Evil Empire, with the sole purpose to transfer their loot to the West and settle down for retirement. As described in this novel, British Intelligence was directly involved in money laundering for ex-Soviet high ranking defectors. The \\"evil genius\\" behind the Lipizzaner accounts at Brue Fr&eacute;res plc was Mr Teddy Findley, who introduced himself as \\"some kind of informal British diplomat\\". According to the witness statement of the bank secretary Frau Ellenberger, the British Embassy in Vienna was directly involved in the creation of the money laundering accounts for Russian crooks.<br /><br />Stateless illegal immigrant Issa Karpov, with his face on literally every police webpage, was by the time he got to the negotiation table from legal point of view virtually beyond salvation, and was under imminent threat of arrest and deportation to either Russia or Turkey. Following threats of serious adverse consequences for \\"harbouring a terrorist\\", Issa's lawyer Annabel Richter eventually started cooperating with the German intelligence. Mr Brue, to save his bank from legal consequences of the money laundering accounts, agreed to cooperation with the British.<br /><br />The plan created by the British and German Intelligence Services was wonderfully simple: Annabel Richter and Mr Brue will persuade Issa Karpov to claim his inheritance, which he otherwise would prefer to avoid, as he considered his father's loot from Chechnya \\"filthy money\\". The entire sum will then be donated to Dr Abdullah, codenamed Signpost, and transferred to various Islamic charities, and Issa will be its first beneficiary. In addition, Issa would get his status in Germany legalized and would be provided by a German passport.<br /><br />The only small hiccup in the deal occurred, when the Joint Committee stopped the project because of concerns that Dr Abdullah finances terrorism through some of his charities. Issa Karpov and Dr Abdulah were abducted right after the meeting and handed over to the Americans and let them to do the dirty work.<br /><br />In short, British and German Intelligence Services masterminded the deal, manipulated the target into it under combination of promises and threats, and eventually got him arrested for acting exactly as directed. One would love to believe that this story is a fiction and has nothing to do with the real methods of work of all sorts of various agencies. A most wanted man is a great book, a must read for everyone who ever had anything to do with intelligence work, no matter how officially and no matter on which side.bducted right after the meeting and handed over to the Americans and let them to do the dirty work.

B002VWNIAY|5.0|This movie is a classic.  The DVD was an excellent quality DVD recording, streaming from Amazon got the same high quality image (stand def in B&W which is how I wanted to see it).  Exactly what I wanted in a copy of this classic movie.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Wow---a non-stop action thriller with no guns, no drugs and no one trying to heist something.  The acting and character development are great.  The interaction of the old veteran and the newbe between Washington and Pine, may have been done before, but they bring a great chemistry to the relationship.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I loved Accelerate and so glad REM made another CD.  This CD just grows on you.  Just great music and melodies.  So far I love at least eight of the songs.  Does remind me of some of the older REM songs, which is good.  I wish Bill would at least co-write some of the music with the guys, just tell him he doesnt have to tour. I hope they continue to make great music for many years to come.  Also, I cant believe the low price of this CD.  I was also shocked that REM would give out free songs (who does that nowadays?).  Just goes to show the fans that they are not just in it for the money.  Thank you REM.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is a must-see for any person wanting to know how corrupt the relationship between Wall Street, regulators, and the government has gotten.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the graphs, pie charts and animations that help explain complex ideas. I don't think this is a political documentary at all, mostly just revealing facts that seem to be under the surface but apparent when you look at the evidence over time.<br /><br />A required viewing for those involved in politics, economics, and the financial industries. Or if you're an American.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|The indie rock scene to quietly becoming the standard bearers for musical innovation. The album is just one example of the creative things that are being down with the blending of instruments and technology and creative song writing. One example of their genius is \\"Crystalised,\\" where the male and female vocals sing the same melody but different lyrics, so it creates the paradox of concordant discordance.

Seasons 1 and about half of Season 2 aren't the greatest, but from Season 3 onward, Star Trek: TNG is amazing. With plotlines that are morality plays as much as adventure stories, I just love TNG. Philosophical entertainment done right. My thanks to all involved in its creation over the years!

1563894696|5.0|If you're turned off by the art as much as I was at first please put that notion aside. It somehow grows onto you and it seems that somewhere in the middle of the book it seems to get better. Tim Sale artfully crafts Jeph Loeb's story so well that you have no option but to enjoy the piece as a whole.<br /><br />I hate comics that have crappy art because a comic is supposed to tell a story not only through words, but through visuals, and this is really achieved throughout the entire comic. Tim Sale has a way with contrast, strong ink lines, appropriate colors, and fantastic compositions, the graphic novel is actually stylistic in an excellent way.<br /><br />The story is compelling and I was always the edge of my proverbial seat. Don't hesitate to pick this fine graphic novel up today.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|This is Norah Jone's best album.  Unquestionably she possesses a great, unique voice.  It is, however, limited in both its technical and emotional range.  That causes her vocals to wear thin after a while, both over the course of an album and over the course of her career.  CD sales seem to back that up.  That's why this is such a brilliant idea.  If her voice, while fantastic, has little variation, vary the styles and the performers, and have her sing harmonies and duets.  It has often been said of Emmylou Harris, who has an equally great voice, that she was born to sing harmony and duets.  I think, based on this CD, the same can be said of Norah Jones.

Rush has always chosen evolution over stagnation; Following there collective hearts instead of following trends.  They continue to entertain and grow and share with all of us there passion for the thing they do.  There was a time where Rush was known as the LAST OF THE '70' POWER TRIOS....I suppose that's true but....what band, after all these years...has displayed the kind of honesty, integrity, creativity, virtuosity, and love for there craft that Geddy, Alex, and Neil (the new guy) bring to the recording studio and most of all the stage.  My life is sort of a road map...dotted with moments punctuated with there music.  Not a bad sound track to live by...not too bad at all.  I have seen them on stage many times. Highlights of which were back in the day when they toured with \\"Max Webster\\" as their opening act....WOW, those were the days but, it was the \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" tour about three years ago when I had the best seat in the house.....I'm a stagehand (in Detroit) by trade and my show call assignment was (down stage right) Truss-spot operator; and my assigned target was Neil in the drum kit!!!!  That was a moment....That was special....to watch and be a part of the performance...for these three extraordinary human beings, who's career I have followed for so long.  Here's to 40 more years of being \\"true to ones self\\".  I felt it back when I was 16 years old....I know and praise it now, 38 years later as something that is all to rare in the world we live in today.  Open hearts.  Open minds.

If you do have enough room in the back of your car or truck and your child can't kick at it, maybe this is for you but for me, it seemed like cheap Chinese junk.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Got this watch as training tool for Marathon runs and it absolution does the job.    Pros:  - GPS and HR monitor are fully integrated.  - Its a watch not a running computer. Very comfortable on the wrist. Light weight. Cool design.   - Its is partially water resistant IP7 and this is much better than no resistance. Wouldn't go swimming with it unless Garmin clearly say it is good to swim with it.  - GPS detection is fast and accuracy is relatively good.  - The connection with USB antenna are easy.  - Connection with HR monitor is easy.  - Data on the Gramin Connect web service is amazingly integrated. It is clear and easy to use.  - Bought it on Amazon so customer service is great.    Cons:  - I received a faulty HR monitor with the Kit.   - Battery is very short and need to have it re-chard almost every other day. It won't give you signal before dying and It would be nice if it did.  - Manual is missing some functionality description such as setting the training manuals and troubleshooting HR monitor connection. The watch is amazingly rich with functions.  - Missing information on the partial Water resistance. Had to dig for info on the web... not something you usually do with such equipment.
B001E75S8C|4.0|This is a great source of understanding piano technique and will be helpful to pianists and teachers at all skill levels.<br /><br />I would have given this video 5 stars had he not hurried through a few of his ideas which needed further development and explanation.<br /><br />Having said that, if you buy his book, \\"Honing the Pianist Self Image\\" to go with it, you've got close to a home run.<br /><br />I personally didn't care for the study guide that you can buy for this video, but I do highly recommend this DVD ~~if you also get the \\"...Self Image\\" book.<br /><br />Get both, you won't regret it. One without the other won't work either- the book is a little dry without the video and the video lacks much of the detail that is necessary that you will get from the book.<br /><br />In my opinion, your next step should be to get the Seymour Fink DVD, \\"Mastering Piano Technique.\\" My review of it is 5 stars, it gives you virtuoso building techniques, thoughtfully presented step by step by step and well explained.<br /><br />...Having said that, watching this first will give you an EVEN BETTER understanding of Fink's techniques.<br /><br />I would also add that Fraser's video and books do give a much better explanation of the hand and what you need to know about it, but Fink's gives you far more detailed actual \\"go and do it\\" piano technique and practical exercises.<br /><br />Another suggestion-<br /><br />I also read \\"Famous Pianists and Their Technique\\" (about 500+ pages of the history of piano technique, with its thoroughly detailed explanations of the various \\"schools of thought\\").<br /><br />That book gave me an understanding of how the so-called \\"Finger Action School,\\" \\"Arm Weight School,\\" and \\"Relaxation School\\" came about and then explains in excellent detail how these ideas evolved into the more modern and more rational and even science based methods that we have today.<br /><br />Reading that book made all of the Fraser and Fink technique and information make much more sense. For example, right of the bat, Fraser talks about the finger action school and how it fails you and then the arm weight school and how that can fail you, so having read the \\"Famous Pianists..\\" book, I now know what he's talking about, which I didn't quite get before.  For those of us that didn't get formal music education and college level music history, the \\"Famous Pianists...\\" book is quite helpful.<br /><br />To wrap it up, get this video, buy his \\"Self Image\\" book and then to really make progress once you've fully understood what Fraser has presented here, get the Fink video.ction school and how it fails you and then the arm weight school and how that can fail you, so having read the \\"Famous Pianists..\\" book, I now know what he's talking about, which I didn't quite get before.

B0049U4INC|5.0|\\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions\\", by Guy Kawasaki, is about influence and persuasion. The author defines \\"enchantment\\" as the process of delighting people with a product, service, organization, or idea. The outcome of enchantment is voluntary and long-lasting support that is mutually beneficial.<br />The greater your goals, the more you'll need to change people's hearts, minds, and actions. This is especially true if you have few resources and big competitors. Enchantment is a process, not an event. You want your efforts to endure, and this requires that people internalize your cause, reciprocate, and fulfill their commitments. Enchantment transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility. It changes skeptics and cynics into believers. When you enchant people, your goal is not to make money from them or to get them to do what you want, but to fill them with delight. This book is about touching hearts, building relationships and changing the world.<br /><br />Guy Kawasaki stated that he studied twenty books on the subjects of influence and persuasion before he wrote \\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions\\". He listed these books in a bibliography at the end of this book. I believe the research that Mr. Kawasaki did for this book was outstanding. He gleaned the best information from these books and then added many stories from personal experiences that prove his research true. The following chapters are included in the book;<br /><br />Why Enchantment?<br />How To Achieve Likability<br />How To Achieve Trustworthiness<br />How To Prepare<br />How To Launch<br />How To Overcome Resistance<br />How To Make Enchantment Endure<br />How To Use Push Technology<br />How To Use Pull Technology<br />How To Enchant Your Employees<br />How To Enchant Your Boss<br />How To Resist Enchantment<br /><br />As you can see, most of the chapter headings begin with the words \\"How To\\". This book provides specific instructions and real-life stories about how to use \\"enchantment\\" to improve your business and your life. The principles in this book can be applied to all aspects of your life. It is time to change our focus from \\"what can I get from this?\\" to \\"how can I fill you with delight?\\" I believe this is one of the hottest books on the market today.

B0031R5K68|3.0|An enjoyable read for those who like Dan Brown novels. Perhaps not as exotic and The Da Vinci Code but none the less contain similar elements that make you want to read the next chapter.<br /><br />Set in Washington D.C. with the conspiratorial back drop of the Masons the story follows a similar line to previous Brown books. IT gets straight into the action and then follows a familiar path as the story unfolds and characters search for clues to a seemingly never ending number of puzzles.<br /><br />There are plenty of interest conspiratorial topics mentioned in the book that add flavour. Unfortunately some of the location seems a bit synthetic, even though they aren't, but this is where the novel perhaps lacks the exoticness of The Da Vinci Code with is grand European locations. These still create an intriguing backdrop that does make you want to read more and reveal the secrets of the plot line.<br /><br />The book is easy to read if not a little long. It is very much in the style and plot of Brown's previous work, especially The Da Vinci Code. This however, does not detract from its enjoyment. An entertaining and enticing read but perhaps the plot line is now becoming a little worn.
030745455X|3.0|I read the first book, although it was slow to start, it turned out to be a good story. This book was a lot darker, showing more about Lisbeth's dark past and a topic of sex trafficking that really is tough to read. this book shows why Lisbeth is the way she is, what happened to her when she was younger, but really sad and morbid. I was more sad for her than excited to find out who did it. Not my best book. Didn't really get the fascination.
0446563048|5.0|This was an amazing book!  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  What I really loved about this book was that it was different.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I didn't really think much of Adele's first album, \\"19\\".  I like her voice but I didn't hear anything spectacular on that album.    \\"21\\" on the other hand...well, this is an album.  And I mean that in the best possible way: it's not just a collection of songs thrown together, it's a journey, a story...told by a master storyteller.    There really isn't a weak song on the album.  \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" and \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Don't You Remember\\" and \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" are all slightly more outstanding than the rest but the whole thing is very, very strong.    In my opinion, two songs stand apart: \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\".  Hard to say which I like more.  The energy of \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" is amazing...as is the emotion of \\"Someone Like You\\".  If you have no interest in the whole album, at least get these two songs.  No, I mean right now, go get them.  I'll wait.    Okay, got them?  Good.  Go listen to them.  And when you're done, come back and get the whole album.  And when you've listened to that, come back and write a review, because we need to let the world know about this.  In a musical landscape where empty noise usually wins the day (Lady Gaga? Justin Bieber?), Adele's \\"21\\" stands as a throwback to the days when artists actually cared about the product they put out, rather than simply trying to \\"cash in\\" on whatever the popular fad of the day happens to be.

I get 7.6 on Windows 7 \\"Processor\\" experience index. I'm currently overclocking it at 4.0 gig without any issues.  The ASUS motherboard is the best value for this processor. It comes with so many options I could never list them all. The best feature is the Turbo EVO software that allows novice overclockers to find that sweet spot. I used it and got 4.0 gig without ever entering the BIOS.  The two Corsair products (Power supply and sealed liquid processor cooler) worked as expected. After all they are Corsair. I wish Corsair would do a video for AMD processors, their only instructional video is all about Intel. BTW my CPU runs between 29 degrees C and 36 degrees C, depending on load. Thanks Corsair!  The WD hard drive worked fine. No problems that some of the one star raters (haters) posted.  The Cooler Master Scout case is a dream. Lots of room to work and I really like the handle and 4 USB ports up front.  The ADATA memory is very stable and I have had no problems running it at rates higher than 1600. Simply had to tell the BIOS to do it. I get 7.6 on Windows 7 \\"Memory\\" experience index.  The DVD drive works fine. What can you say? It's a DVD drive.  The Viewsonic 24\\" LCD display is one of the best values of this entire build. At $169.99 you just can't beat it. The speakers are crap but the display is crisp.    Now for my only gripe... the two Cooler Master 120mm Red LED Case Fan's are TOO LOUD. I liked the idea that I could add these fans to the Scout case's see through panel. What a waste of $20. I'll use them somewhere, sometime... but for now they sit on my bench.

It also has the potential to make your Doctor Who fan friends jealous! The only trouble that I've had with the screwdriver is that the ink nib comes loose easily, and the screw in the sonic screwdriver that releases the UV light(at least on my sonic screwdriver), has come loose easily.  The only other problem I have with the screwdrvier is the fact that it did not come with Psychic Paper although one can't have everything! Apart from these minor issues, the Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver is one excellent item to purchase!!    (Authored by Bronte Fan's 15-YO son!  Guess I'm raising another Anglophile!)
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Only on occasion do I listen to rap music but I graduated from a College University of music/art and know a thing or two about good talent This album is excellent...period. Not only does it tell a story about life, one that many of us can relate to, it's inspiring and lets us know that we are not alone during the many trials of life that we face. The combination of singer/songwriter meets rap is brilliant and it meshes well in this particular album. I would highly recommend this album to anyone.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Alright kiddies, time to grow up. Take your Twilight DVDs and throw them into the garbage where they belong. Time to graduate from grade school and move right in with the upper class. Let Me In is the vampire movie that real vampire movie fans have been wanting for years. (Before I continue I just want to apologize to the fans of Twilight. I mean no offense. I'm only saying, in a humorous way, that Let Me In is in no way Twilight.)<br /><br />Some of you may already know this but Let Me In is a remake of a Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In.\\" For those of you who may have seen this I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Let Me In. With the exception of a few scenes, Let Me In stays true to the original. The few scenes that were changed were mostly do to cultural difference or confusing segments. Let Me In is neither better nor worse, it's just an Americanized version of a very good movie.<br /><br />For those who didn't know of or see the original, you're in for a treat. I wouldn't call this a horror film, but more of a dramatic thriller. It follows a young boy named Owen, a skinny, shy, socially awkward twelve year old. His young life is in shambles: his parents are divorcing, he doesn't have any friends, and he's being bullied in school. The only thing in his life that makes him happy are Now & Laters. But then Abby moves in next door, a mysterious young girl who finds Owen just as curious as he finds her. They slowly strike up a friendship, and through her Owen starts to take a little bit of control in his life. Yet something doesn't seem right about Abby, and Owen must decide if he wants to let that get in the way of his friendship with the young girl Abby.<br /><br />Let Me In doesn't pull many punches in terms of content. It is brutal and bloody. It has quite a few mature situations. And it carries with every scene a brooding and dark atmosphere. I guess that's to be expected though when it comes to real vampire films.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie to any fan of quality horror or thriller films. It's a solid addition to a very small line of movies (that being good, mature vampire films). And, if you're sick of those sparkling-chested, sun-walking, baseball-playing, emo-vampires from \\"other\\" movies then you'll love Let Me In.... (Again, Twilight fans, I'm sorry....)or or thriller films. It's a solid addition to a very small line of movies (that being good, mature vampire films). And, if you're sick of those sparkling-chested, sun-walking, baseball-playing, emo-vampires from \\"other\\" movies then you'll love Let Me In.... (Again, Twilight fans, I'm sorry....)

B0013N7AD8|5.0|i would rate this 8 out of 5 stars if i could. the picture quality is only that of a DVD but hey what can ya say it wasnt exactly filmed in high definition
B002KFPMBA|5.0|Its funny and appealing to a certain type of personalities. If you like very sarcastic-pop culture reference type of humor you will like Glee

B0043ISH6O|5.0|After listening to this soundtrack following a viewing of the movie, I could not help but be reminded of my Tangerine Dream collection. Quite a few reviewers here compare this soundtrack to other works by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and others contributing to this genre of music in recent years, but I was surprised to read only one review that even mentioned German electronic pioneer Tangerine Dream. In my opinion, track #3 \\"A Familiar Taste\\" and track #5 \\"Intriguing Possibilities\\" (originally \\"In Evidence\\") are especially reminiscent of earlier Tangerine Dream works, earlier as in \\"Optical Race\\" (1988) and \\"Melrose\\" (1990) from the \\"Melrose Years\\" rather than \\"Electronic Meditation\\" (1970) from the \\"Pink Years\\", although the spirit of the group can be heard throughout the entire soundtrack. It so happens that in an interview with \\"Social Network\\" sound editor Ren Klyce, it was commented that director David Fincher's goal was to \\"reinvent the film-going experience that we had back in the 80's, back when films were scored electronically. He wanted to have that feeling in the audience of getting the sensation of, 'Wow, this is a very unusual soundtrack. I've never heard Tangerine Dream before.' But he wanted to do it in a modern way with a modern twist.\\" Exactly. And track #2 \\"In Motion\\" (originally \\"Let the Hacking Begin\\") is even danceable, one of the best since Skinny Puppy's \\"Who's Laughing Now\\" on the \\"Bad Influence\\" soundtrack that can also be found on \\"VIVIsectVI\\" (1988). Sure Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were influenced by their predecessors. So what? This soundtrack is one of the few that can be listened to quietly while in a reflective mode or in deep concentration during a work project, on long car drives on winding roads, or even turned up to a volume of 11. The best praise I can offer such an album since my review of Autechre's \\"Incunubula\\" (1993), albeit \\"Social Network\\" is electronic music for the masses.

0515141429|1.0|This book was recommended to me by my housemate who RAVES about the entire series. I started this book with high hopes as she and I have about the same taste in books and movies. I can't tell you how hard I had to work to make myself read this book. I was beyond bored. He's over descriptive to the max. He'll take 3 paragraphs to describe a park bench that has no bearing on the story. Don't get me started on the unrealistic story line. It's a bit like \\"24\\". A too long, boring \\"24\\". This could have been a short story and should have.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|I tried to enjoy this book, I really did. i enjoy paranormal romance, but this one was a bit too far fetched even for me. There weren't any believable aspects to this story.
B0041B4H1M|5.0|I dont know what people are talking about this was a very entertaining movie, its like a jaws only better.  The  blu-ray quality was great the sound was great along with the price.  What more can i say,  I am waiting for deep rising to come out on blu-ray which is my other favorite next to this one.  GET THIS MOVIE ITS WORTH IT :)
0061997811|5.0|When I first saw this book online I wanted it immediately. I instantly fell in love with it and I had never even touched it! So when I finally ordered it I became I bit afraid because, for one: the price is not so low and two: I'm such a huge Harry Potter fan and was already expecting this book to be amazing, I did NOT want to be dissapointed. Once my book finally arrived, all those thoughts went away. The packaging itself thrilled me! Of course, probably like any other person that has this book, the first thing I did after tearing out the plastic that sealed the book, I went straight to the facsimiles. From Harry's 1st Hogwarts letter, and Potion stickers to the 422nd Quiditch World Cup Programme and (my favorite) the Marauder's map. Discovering every one of these products inside the book was the best eperience as a Harry Potter fan. Once I was done with all my excitement, I began reading it. I was absolutely amazed. The book was so fun, detailed and impressive that I finished reading it that same night. As a true Harry Potter fan, you won't be dissapointed with this book.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This blu-ray is a steal.  YOU get all these great movies for 40 dollars in great picture and sound.  All the rocky movies made you feel everything he was going through.  I just hate it after getting out of the ghetto makin it big, he ends up the same way at the end also losing his wife.  Its like the movie went forward and back to reverse.  All in all great !!!!!!!
B003UESJ9M|2.0|The four main performers in this movie can all sing AND act...and needed those talents in this depressing, two-dimensional, dreadful flat-footed film.   I don't think I laughed once...even the tiniest bit.  I didn't cry at the sad parts because they were just too contrived.  We splurged on \\"first day\\" tickets before reading any reviews; last time for that!  And while Gwyneth CAN sing..and Tim CAN act; they are both MUCH better at their day jobs.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|Seriously, could the studios screw something up just a little bit more. Here's a hint. Fire anyone who put this together. The first one had me on edge the whole time. I was freaked for ever. I was on edge on this one for most of it but nothing happened...? Finaly I decided to not base my expectations from the first one and I just sat back and relaxed....and continued to relax....and relaxed some more. Excuse me, this is paranormal activity? Everything that happened felt so....obvious and staged as well. Honestly, you could skip at least half the movie and not miss anything. Well, except the hispanic nanny who is a ghostbuster in hiding. Everyone knows that hispanics are only good for basic jobs for the white man and also that they are all super religious and know about spirits! White man is to advanced to acknowledge the spirit realm anymore. Bring in the brown and red people! They are backward enough to understand. What garbage. I hope Paramount lost lots and lots of money on this. Losers.
0698118308|4.0|We've been reading this to our 28 month old for over a year now.  She still enjoys it.  Admittedly, I was a little disappointed when I first read it as it didn't seem to have the same magic as the other Carle books.  Evidently, my daughter disagrees!  What is so great about the book is that it can appeal on many levels. At first, she began to notice and point out clouds to us.  Now she focuses on the imaginative aspect of the book - she sees shapes in clouds, pieces of cheese, etc.  We have several Eric Carle books, and it seems to be a perennial favorite.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|What a shame that someone convinced this talented writer to spend so much time in a school for wizards (original idea!). Pedestrian plodding and plotting which cut by 60% might be something special.
0891040234|5.0|I picked this out after falling in love with the sherlock holmes movie. This is one of the best book i have read even though i was never a mystery fan. (I even stayed up all night just to finish it) I got me so into it. I can't ever imagine someone being so brilliant! im sure you will enjoy it as much as i did.
0670022411|4.0|Do you like witches, vampires and deamons? Do you like history, science and chemistry? If you answered yes than this book is for you. The author has created memorable characters that bring you inside their very thoughts. She has placed them in landmark locations and made their presence known throughout time. The number of literary references are astounding. It is rare to read a fictional book that adds Newton, Einstein, Plato, Aristotle and Shakespeare to the mix.     My only complaint about this book is I want to know what happens next. I hope there is a sequel in the works.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this controller for my boyfriend as a replacement for the one I formerly bought. The one I bought prior to this one ended up being a fake ps3 controller which was a total let down. However, I thought a little weary about this one as well because I was sold on the price. However, this has been a legit ps3 dualshock controller and my boyfriend and myself have been very pleased with it! We have not had any problems with it and we are very pleased with how things turned out. Thanks to Amazon we were able to get what we were looking for at a reasonable price. Thanks!
B00005NB0H|3.0|I am a Who fan, but not a fanatic. I have always liked the original (vinyl) Live at Leeds. Great live stuff when a band was at its peak. I expected a bit more from this expanded version.<br />Getting to hear the entire Tommy project live is interesting, and it shows some great guitarwork from Pete. I almost forgot how emotional his playing his. But Roger's voice is seriously weak here. He cannot hit the high notes at all. I wonder how he hits them in the studio, because they are clearly beyond him live. Pete should always be the vocalist because he is on key and sounds great. John and Keith sound great, as usual.<br />Overall, an okay purchase because I love the Who. But most casual fans should stick to the original Live at Leeds.

1400052181|5.0|So much has been written about this book, and there is really nothing new that I could add at this point, except to put another check mark for it in the 5 star category of ratings.  It was really the most incredibly rich, textured and moving story that I have read in a long, long time.  I actually finished it several weeks ago and I am still thinking about it and mulling it over in my mind.  It ranks among one of the best books I have ever read.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've used only one of the 3 levels on this dvd, but so far, I'm impressed. The workout is tough, but doable, and I can do it without getting an asthma attack. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quck, but effective workout routine.
B004J88SGC|4.0|Well the quality is superb, however as someone who went to the Final Night I know that there was some major editing done. First off the track order is totally out of whack, and at times it seems as if Billy's voice is in a different key than what I remember and have heard via the bootlegs. Overall it is a great recording, all be it edited recording, of this historic event with perhaps the best american singer/songwriter of the last 30 years.
1573300403|5.0|You will enjoy this History Vol.2  As always you can count on M.J. giving his great performance of singing and dancing. I truly can,t get enough. I will keep collecting his music and books. Thank you Amazon...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a bit upset when I realized, after downloading to my Kindle, that this book is classified as \\"young adult.\\" Blast!  I'm 35 years old and just paid for a kids book?!  I have never returned a single online purchase, it just seems like such a hassle (although I hear it's rather painless).  The description seemed compelling enough for me to select the book, so I decided to just read it.  I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />I do NOT think this should be classified as a teen read.  The only reasons I can think of is the age of the lead characters and the lack of sex.  This book is incredibly violent.  I would not want my kid to read it.  That being said, I would have certainly read it as a child.  I read Silence of the Lambs before the theatrical release while in junior high school.<br /><br />I don't want to delve into the plot developments; I hate spoilers.  All I can say is:  I devoured this book and the two sequels with fervor.  I frequent mockingjay.net on a regular basis.  I scour YouTube for videos on the series.  I am obsessed and will be first in line for the planned movie.  Based on my recommendation, I have introduced Panem to many friends.  It is a series that stays in your head long after the last page is read.

0375429743|4.0|This book is excellent for basic strategies for all standardized tests, and great iBT specific strategies.  I used this book to teach a TOEFL preparation class.  I used this book for the first portion on how to use strategies to conquor the exam, but I wish it had more examples.  I had to use a separate book to provide my students with more examples.      Another thing that is not as great, is that the CDs, while nice, aren't timed, so you need a stopwatch to help you out to make sure you are preparing only in the time alloted.  Overall, I really like the book and the method they used.   You will need to have a relativley good level of English in order to succeed at this exam.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a terrific video series!  The HD footage and imagery is just amazing!  Wonderful tool to use for social studies teachers, parents or babysitters who want to have something meaningful on TV, or home-schoolers... seriously wonderful presentation.  If you can get the series for around $35 (brand new cost around $75-$80), I think its well worth it.
1400079144|3.0|This is a great book to read on planes and in airports waiting for connecting flights. The 'twists' were obvious, I'd figured them all out in the beginning and the characters were a bit stereotypical. However, although a little unbelievable as all of this happened in one night (how many hours in a night do they have in DC?)it was still a sort-of-a page-turner that kept you from being bored on a day where you had to catch three flights.<br />Dan Brown is sticking to his recipe which saw him achieve great success with the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. He knows what makes him money and you can't criticize him for that. Many people complain about his poor writing, but that isn't what stopped me from really liking this book. Honestly, his writing isn't too different from that of many other authors out there. It was the improbability of his plot which killed it for me. But that said, it was still an entertaining airport read, and better than sitting watching all the people walk past.
B004HWR406|2.0|I didn't care for this movie.  I kept asking myself why I should care about a bunch of greedy upstarts and their legal squabbles between themselves.

B002F6FQGK|4.0|I've been meaning to listen to this band,after I heard rave reviews from their MTV AWARDS performance. I did think it was alittle strange that MTV decided to put on a no name band since every big performer wants to be on the VMAS. I really liked the performance and thought it was creative. I downloaded this album a few days later, and recently just listened to it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I was expecting to hear the the same kind of rock that you normally hear, but I found that this album has alot of soul to it. Alot of the tracks remind me of Eurythmics In the Garden album. Alot of their stuff sounds light rock mixed in with instrumental synthesizers. Dogs Days Are Over are just one of the many songs that are great on this album. If your a fan of Pop music then I would defiantly buy this album!

B001EO748M|5.0|\\"The Tudors\\" is a wonderful version of the story of Henry VIII.  Everything about it is top notch: writing, art direction, cinematography, sets, costumes, acting, editing.  I don't know how much it deviates from the actual events that took place, but who cares?  Warning:  if you get through the first couple of episodes, you will be hooked.
0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" was recommended to me by my niece, a high school librarian. While I appreciate the recommendation because this is one of the best books I've ever read, I am clueless as to why it is categorized as \\"young adult.\\" As others have written, it concerns me that that has limited its audience.  I'm 65 and thought it amazing and my sister and a friend have also read it recently and feel the same. The writing is some of the most magnificient I've ever encountered, although it took me a little while to get with his style. I even considered not continuing with it, but am so glad that I didn't give into that. The characters stay with you long after you've finished the last page. What an achievement. As a writer, I'm jealous!  As a reader, I'm grateful!

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Darker than Disney's \\"Cinderella\\" and less gruesome than the Grimm version, \\"Ever After\\" is a delightful, highly romantic version of the tale. Danielle (Barrymore) is not your classic Cinderella---yes, she is persecuted by her step-mother and one of her step-sisters, but she doesn't take it lying down. She is a strong woman who speaks her mind and stands up for those in need---and the prince doesn't rescue her; she rescues herself. Scott and Barrymore have great chemistry, Huston makes an excellent villain, and there are plenty of comical moments to lighten the heaviness of the drama. (Watch for the wedding scene with the sobbing bride. Cracks me up every time!) I highly recommend this film!
0061020710|4.0|The Color of Magic is the first book in the Discworld series, and while it is not necessary to start from the beginning, I think it serves as an excellent starting point. This book marks the beginning of the Rincewind story line. The protagonist of this novel, Rincewind, is a incompetent wizard and likely the worlds largest coward. However, he continually finds himself in positions where heros would be much more comfortable and must deal with these as they come.<br /><br />The book has some very solid fantasy elements and the world itself is very full of magic, but the story goes much further than that. It is told a really funny at satirical way that raises the level of enjoyment. The book is more of a spoof of the fantasy genere than it is a fantasy novel in itself. However, at the same time, the world is very well developed in a meaningful and interesting way. Additionally, the characters are all very interesting and developed fairly well (for example, a suitcase with a real personality).<br /><br />There is a lot to enjoy here for not only the fantasy fan, but also for those just looking for a well told story.
0439023521|5.0|First, I have to say I LOVED these books.  I am an avid reader and especially love books geared to younger readers, even though I am in my 20's.  Now, for the books.    The story line was fantastic.  Original, but not too far out there.  It was set up well and the characters were very easy to attach to.    My main complaint is that the author was slightly hard to read.  She would phrase things in different ways that I thought was confusing and I would have to reread a few times to comprehend fully.  Also, during some parts I had a hard time visualizing the settings the characters were in.    But overall, I still have to give these books 5 out of 5 stars!

1591396190|1.0|UPDATE 2012: Check out their website. The same case studies and that they have had for almost a decade. No research to back the model and ideas up. But the book is a bestseller. Sad state of the world. Read an insightful book instead. Like [[ASIN:0307886239 Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters]]. It makes you think.<br /><br />I continue to be amazed by the popularity of this book. I read it a couple of years ago and it has enough material for a very nice HBR article. The book is written by two INSEAD professors, but don't let that fool you. It is not at all based on academic research and it lacks rigor. The core model \\"value curve\\" is similar to perception curves used by marketing research for several decades. There is nothing wrong with borrowing ideas as long as their origin is acknowledged. I think the authors have taken most of ideas from marketing and then pass them on as novel ideas in strategic management. The book really reads like its been written by management consultants.<br /><br />The authors are certainly skilled in repackaging old material using fancy terminology. The idea of creating new markets is naturally important (but hardly novel). Only suckers will consider \\"blue ocean\\" different to \\"new market\\" or \\"new product category\\". If you like books with lots of frameworks with very catchy descriptions, you will probably like this book. If you think that the authors' INSEAD affiliation will mean that the work is built on serious academic research you will be sorely disappointed. I think the business school should at least force the authors to be a bit more honest were the ideas are coming from. But, hey, money talks and this is probably a money spinner for INSEAD.<br /><br />The authors' idea is called value innovation. We might just as well call it business model innovation or strategic innovation. A book that covers similar themes but with much more rigor is Markides's [[ASIN:0875848338 All the Right Moves ,A Guide to Crafting Breakthrough Strategy 1999 publication]]. That book is written without any buzzword in a pretty straightforward way, but behind the surface is actually quite a lot of structured thinking. I can recommend that book for anyone who is interested in finding/creating new markets.<br /><br />My advice is to read their HBR article. Most of their ideas you'll find condensed in ten pages.y 1999 publication]].

B000PC0U1W|5.0|Since the ascendancy of Obama, I have used the title above to describe the vision of Obama and the totalitarian wing of the Democratic Party.  The ultimate expression of this vision is their rhetoric of Republicans as enemies of society, and the transformation of individuals from people into wasteful consumers of social resources in the form of healthcare, when such resources can be used to \\"better\\" society, a waste that the government must control.  (Betterment of society is a truth only the state can know).  The Obama vision of healthcare is well expressed publicly in Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's graph of an individual's worth to society and corresponding worth for medical services.  Both babies and the elderly in Obama's vision will receive the least amount of healthcare due to their least value status to society.  To maintain infant mortality statistics, an infant will not be considered born for 24 hours and not contribute to mortality statistics unless dead after living into the second day.<br /><br />The movie V for Vendetta is an amazing replication of the Obama, Pelosi and Reid vision for America.  Unbridled power by the state and the party that controls the state (explaining Obama, Pelosi and Reid's most violent opposition to justices and judges who do not believe in the Democratic Party totalitarian vision). The movie describes the sycophantic support of Obama, Pelosi and Reid by the mainstream media.  The movie makers anticipated  the future turn in American politics in the election of Obama and the control of the American federal government by the totalitarian Democratic Party.<br /><br />Yet all is not lost, the movie also anticipated the Tea Party the grassroots up rising of ordinary people against the totalitarian vision of the Democratic Party.  Most amazing a movie.<br /><br />The motto now will be Orwell, Obama & 1984:  A Common Vision; Ripe for V for Vendetta.
0545123283|4.0|Linger by Maggie Stiefvater is the second novel after Shiver. After Sam is cured he now has to learn how to just be Sam in live completely in the human world and what this may mean for the rest of the wolves. Grace is coming down the wolf type symptoms. Symptoms one only gets when they are getting ready to turn. We are also introduced to a new character Cole who is a new werewolf in town. This sequel answers some questions from the last book but also opens up a whole new can of questions which just leaves readers coming back for more when the third book comes out. I liked this book a lot. There was more internal problems in the story than external. Yeah the people in town were still trying to get rid of the wolves but it was more of an after thought in the plot. Sam was busy with his struggle to find a balance of being himself and trying to help out his family the wolves. Grace was struggling in what she was becoming, Isabel was trying to come to terms with the guilt she felt over her brother's death, and Cole was just trying to disappear from his life so he didn't have to end up like his father. I like the new additional view points, but I really did not like Cole's character at all until the end. His complete turn about happened too fast I thought, but if he stays on track like this then I think I can like him that much more in the next book. The ending of the book, I couldn't not believe. I saw it coming of course but I guess I was just hoping that they would be able to stop it from happening and I was very surprised by Sam's choice. Grace was his number one priority and to not go with her and to live his human life, because he new she would understand I thought it was kind of a cop out considering she risked killing him so he can stay with her. I think once I see how this plays out I will feel differently about his decision. Good book 4 stars.
B003S0IJWA|4.0|Bernstein recorded the Beethoven symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic for DG during the late 1970s to much acclaim.  Those performances quickly overshadowed Bernstein's earlier set with the NYPO recorded for Columbia in the 1960s.  There is much to recommend in this earlier survey of the symphonies however, collected by Sony Classical here along with a set of overtures and a great performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with Isaac Stern as soloist.  These performances have an exuberance, energy, and scrappy, rough-hewn quality that is missing in the more refined and sometimes stodgy Vienna set.  For example, the recording of the Eroica symphony in this NY collection has a fire and verve missing from the often stately, overly monumental foray with Vienna.  Of particular worth in this set are the performances of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th symphonies.  I feel the one disappointment is the performance of the 9th Symphony, which lacks the drama that characterized his later Vienna recording of the 9th (and the other performances in this collection for that matter).<br /><br />In short, fans of Bernstein and Beethoven will be well served by this collection and should find much to enjoy.
0545123275|4.0|I was very surprised to like shiver as much as I did. It is told from the points of view of Grace and Sam. Sam is a werewolf and Grace is the girl who loves him. Ever since she was young Grace has had a fascination with the wolves that live in the woods behind her house. When she was young she was bitten by one but was saved by Sam, the wolf with yellow eyes. They finally meet when she is 17 and he 18 under unfortunate circumstances. Throughout the novel Sam has to fight his will to change so he does not leave Grace and Grace has to fight to find a cure for the one she loves. In the backdrop are a colorful bunch of characters that are helpful to the plot and character development. I especially liked getting to know the rest of the wolf pack from Sam's memories of them. He loved them so much despite how much he hated being a wolf. They were his family. Grace's character is the independent sort who pretty much raised herself. I think she needs Sam in a way that she never needed another person before. I give it 4 stars, there are a lot of unanswered questions that are explained more in the sequel, but it was a great opening and I can tell it will only get better.
1591843790|5.0|I have always enjoyed Guy Kawasaki's insight and experience and this book did not disappoint. This book is another must read to help break open how we have been molded and start thinking in a more creative positive way and put your spell on those around you to enchant them!!!
B004PA50JM|5.0|I loveeeddd ittt!!! Great songs! Beautiful! I enjoyed it very very much!!! Especially Überlin, Me Marlon Brando,Marlon Brando and I... Blue sounds very nostalgic to me.
B001974DG0|5.0|I've decided to 5 star all my favorite books as i feel they deserve the bump and will increase the chances someone else may read a fantastic book.
0812550706|5.0|A number of years ago while in a book store a friend of mine asked me if I like science fiction books and I said \\"NO!\\". I felt that all science fiction books were lame and spoke only to people who like going to Star Trek conventions. Plus I had this thought that since the book was written in the 80's that it would be prone to being dated for it's time. My friend then dared me to read the book and even went as far as saying \\"You're going to be blown away\\"......I took him up on his dare and I read it and I was blown away. I ended up eating up every word I said before.      The way the author portrays battle tactics in Ender's Game alone is sincerely awesome!! and before you know it you are wrapped up in each character plus The ending is stunning. In short you will lose yourself into the world of Ender's game and from there you will want to continue and follow the series.     I have highly recommended this book to male and female friends of various ages and as well as teenagers. Each person came back saying that they couldnt help themselves and ended up reading the book in a day. My favorite was a friend of mine who couldn't get into any book and would never read and after he got the book he told me that he ended up reading 5 chapters in one sitting.....I was shocked. He's about to finish the book and has ordered Speaker For The Dead.
0061537969|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Although I am a dog lover, I was not sure I would enjoy the idea of a novel from a dogs perspective.  I'm so glad I read the reviews and took a chance.  One of my favorites!  I could not put it down, and finished in about a day and a half. It touched my heart, and I highly recommend this book!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Since purchasing this movie a little over a month ago, I have watched it many times. The storyline is realistic, emotional and well produced, however, it is the chemistry between the lead actors that truly makes this movie. The sparks fly between the two characters, Peyton and Elena. A great watch and well-worth the purchase.
B0038ZITIE|4.0|I must agree with the reviewer who wondered where the bass response had gone. I tried boosting the level of my subwoofer to the point where normally it's so overpowering that there's actually distortion. Result: no appreciable difference.  Having said that, I found the audio to be clear and undistorted; the video, very good.  At Amazon's price this a VERY good deal.  Grab it while you can.
1439148953|4.0|I got this book as a gift from my boyfriend's parents (after only knowing them three months). I'm generally wary of gift books, so it was with a little hesitation that I started this while on vacation recently.    The book, as the other reviewers have noted, is slow-moving. I noted that as I read it but found myself not minding too much. Honestly, this book reminds me a little of the later Little House on the Prairie books, where you're told a lot about daily goings-on alongside the protagonist's feelings and thoughts. This is not an action-packed book by any account. It is, however, an interesting look at Brooklyn in the post-WWII years, as well as an authentic-feeling account of the Irish immigrant experience (obviously, not having been an Irish immigrant, I can't speak to whether it is actually authentic).     At the same time that it isn't a particularly flashy book, it does have a fair amount of drama--just subtle drama. For example, there's a homoerotic scene between Eilis and her coworker, a secret marriage, racial tensions, and more.    Overall, I enjoyed this book and want to explore Coibin's other works. If you're in the market for a leisurely piece of historical fiction, check _Brooklyn_ out.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|the title may sound a little exaggerated but it isn't what machine head did with this album is truly amazing. if you don't believe go give halo a listen and if your not in love then u are either not a metal head or have a serious problem.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|Same as the others, never saw mention anywhere that mirroring only works on iPad 2.   Even worse, you actually get mirrored sound so I spent 20 min on the phone with Apple thinking it was defective.   The package has no instructions, no warnings except for fine print on the back that says \\"mirroring supported by iPad 2.\\"   So, I just paid 40 bucks for something that's more awkward and less useful than AirPlay.  Thanks Apple
B000002OPP|5.0|Another iconic production by Hendrix and actually a small group of musicians and engineers: without synthesizers and computer-driven effects they delivered a masterpiece. Occasional general incoherence; muddiness on the voices, but overall, a true Classic.<br /><br />The most \\"pop\\" sounds here are Crosstown traffic, Little Miss Strange (B-side business but not bad), Gypsy Eyes, Burning of the Midnight Lamp (a good remix pushing the voices forward would work), House Burning Down, All Along the Watchtower (it didn't take long for \\"Jimi [to] take over\\" this Dylan gem, and Voodoo Child (Slight Return), with perhaps *the* signature riff of J.H.<br /><br />Would appreciate any Hendrix-ologists opinion on my opinion that some of the guitar work on Little Miss Strange and Long Hot Summer Night is very similiar to the break on a 1964 Little Richard recording of Money Honey. The historians on the side that Jimi only cut one or two things with Richard is more demonstrative than the other, which claims he is heard on six tunes from 1964 and several from 1965.<br /><br />Nice notes by Michael Fairchild: a 22 page esay, and a page of Jimi stamps!<br /><br />[Note: \\"Track 12: \\"Moon turn the tides...gently gently away\\", listed at 1:01 is actually 8:52].
0515141429|3.0|As noted by others, some of the events require a suspension of disbelief. I almost stopped reading midway through. But having nothing else to read I finished it and found the last half better than the first. I enjoyed the counterfeiting discussions and found the characters interesting.
0321356683|5.0|The book is better than I thought at first sight. Joshua Bloch is certainly a great programmer and has lots of experiences to share in this book.
1594488843|5.0|I wish there were a young teen's version of this book ... sort of like what Chew on this! did for Fast Food Nation.  Pink makes so many interesting points. A shorter version to help parents motivate kids would be great. Intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards discussion was insightful. Other reviewers have said so many of my other positive thoughts about this book.
B000009EAD|4.0|This is another very good album i recommend anyone who likes classic heavy metal to buy. If you like previous albums of Iced Earth you would like this album too. This is not so good as Dark Saga but it has some of their best songs ever ( Blessed are you - Consequences - Disciples of the lie - Melancholy (which is their best song here)).
B004NOH9LW|1.0|This movie was so boring I wanted to kill myself and go to the hereafter just to stop watching it. Seriously one of the most boring movies about life after death that was ever made. The only semi-interesting thing (and only because she was so over the top in her \\"acting\\") was Opie Taylor's daughter acting all sexy. I laughed out loud.
0316098337|5.0|This is one of the first book that I read on the Kindle and I flew through it. Everything from the main character to the events that transpire throughout the book are great.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|Having never got a chance to watch this show when it initially aired, I have to say I found it to be really engaging, in addition to the beautiful scenery, the show is very family oriented & heartfelt, & like others have said, sadly shows like this are a thing of the past on network T.V., there is a lot of history with this show, Jane Seymour is one of the few women in Hollywood who has aged very well, no plastic surgery there, I always thought she was beautiful, & here she even more so, many historical events run parallel with this one, General Custard's war against the native indians, President Grant's attempted assassination, the women's movement, Quinn's struggle to be accepted as a woman doctor, the plagues that killed many in the 1800's, the advancing of Colorado Springs with it's first railroad, it's first bank run by Preston Lodge, the J.R. Ewing of this show, & many walks of life, with character's like Hank(the bartender/pimp), Jake(barber/mayor), Loren(store owner), characters I didn't like at first, but who grew on me, Larry Sellers was great as Cloud Dancing, Joe Lando as Sully, the show's heart & passion, Erika Flores as Colleen who I think outgrew the role of Colleen by being replaced by Jessica Bowman, even Chad Allen who later comes into his own as sherriff, many country music guest stars here as well (Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, Willie Nelson) & John Schneider, it was nice to see him in a role other than Bo Duke(Dukes of Hazzard), this role fit him perfectly as Sully's best friend later sherriff in the 5th & 6th Seasons....whether historically accurate or not, this show gives us the early western life of this nation in a more simpler time & watching the characters you realize that we as a nation have become slaves to our own prosperity & yet you can see the seeds being planted of the challenges now facing our nation today, this show for me was a good history lesson on our never ending need to make money even at the expense of others, all & all a goodshow, money well spent.
0060531053|4.0|Very good read if you are getting into the sport of homebrewing.  Has a number of recipes for all-grain and extracts, and good all around solid advice.  Would recommend.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Lisa Gardner does it again.  i loved every twist..every turn..and every moment of this great novel.  no one does it better than Lisa Gardner.  If only she could write faster.  Ill wait..as always.. for her next great effort.  Keep them coming please!
0143038419|5.0|I can not express enough gratitude for Elizabeth Gilbert. I was going through a little bit of a rough patch in my life and ordered this book on a whim. I never got around to reading it a couple of years back when there was all the hype around it.. it was actually the movie that convinced me to give it a go.     If you are looking for a rigorous bible of sorts of 'how to live a healthy life and love yourself while doing it', then maybe this book isn't for you. Rather more of a casual read, she takes you through her journey of a healthy life. It has been some time since she was utterly at peace with herself, so rather than dwelling on the negative, Elizabeth picks up and flies across the country! Her narrating of this time honestly nearly made me buy a plane ticket to Italy. I fell in love with her ability to describe so realistically, the people and scenes she was experiencing around her. It is a beautiful book, with a beautiful message that is really hard to ignore.    I wouldn't normally re-read books, but I probably will re-read this one. It is like a personal picker-upper, and the feelings you have within once you finish it are very fulfilling. I read this with the lowest of expectations, and maybe that is why I managed to come away with an amazing experience. My advice for you is to treat this like any other book, and enjoy the little gifts of surprise when you come across them.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I bought this film after becoming a backer on KickStarter for the next project these talented ladies are doing, \\"A Perfect Ending.\\" I watched it alone first, and found it honest, romantic and beautiful. Then, in a turn of fate I could not have anticipated, I found myself living it and finding my own \\"twin flame.\\" We watched it together twice, and I can say from my own experience that this film captures what it feels like when love hits you between the eyes from a direction you'd have never expected. My beloved says as well that it shows perfectly how it feels to be a straight Christian woman and suddenly find yourself head over heels in love with another woman.<br /><br />Nicole Conn and Marina Rice Bader have a talent for writing, casting and filming that conveys powerful emotions with veracity, compassion and chemistry. I can't wait for \\"A Perfect Ending.\\"
0061537969|4.0|I am a huge dog lover, so the cover alone almost sold me! But I am a cautious buyer (for the most part) and decided to check the plot line because ordering. Well, turns out I had nothing to worry about. This story is great for any pet lover. It is different from the rest of the dog books (think Marley and Me) because it is told more from the dogs point of view and less the people around it. Have no fear though! It is a very articulate dog. We travel through his life with him, almost step for step, and are there when he is chosen by his owner, and also when it is finally time for him to make the trip to dog heaven. It is a very witty book, with a sort of realism about it. You can't help but take the dog very seriously. The author has done an amazing job at creating a bond between a dog and his family of humans, whom he is completely centered around. It is a very good read, and one I would recommend... but maybe not to your 13 year old! There are a few scenes that may be too explicit. See for yousrelf!
0756665949|4.0|First of all, I obviously didn't read the details, because I was amazed how large the book is.  It definitely is chock full of grammos (\\"while a fugitive for murder in LA, Ana Lucia appeared to Hurley\\" - I kept trying to work out when Ana Lucia was a fugitive for murder), but it's still lots of fun.  I just finished reading about Apollo Bars.  Nobody has mentioned that section (p. 25). Read the ingredients. I laughed out loud.  I gave it 4 stars because of the grammos.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album. Its soulful, its mature, its emotional, its really well composed and Adele's voice is simply amazing. I have a lot of favs on this album for e.g Someone Like you, He Wont Go, Set Fire to the Rain and Rumor Has It. They are all songs that gave me the chills when I listened to the lyrics and the music.<br /><br />My one downside is that Adele can be a little more creative when choosing the names of her album. From my research, it started with 17 (her debut album), then 19 and now 21.
0547338023|3.0|In this modernized, oddly imaginative graphic novel adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince, we meet a pilot stranded in the desert who liked to draw when he was little.  He is soon joined by a little boy who wants him to draw a sheep.  They become friends, and we hear the tale of the small planet the little prince comes from, the unique flower he left behind, and the planets he visits on his way to earth.  Written for the 10 and up crowd, this seems like a great book to get a reluctant boy reader interested, and includes it's own special moral lesson.
0061122092|5.0|Super love story. Super narrative.  I rate it as one of his best two because it is about love and as the Beatles would say  All you need is love, love is all you need.  If you were ever to read this great writer's work I recommend this book or   Veronika Decides to Die as the works to read, even over the Alchemist.
B0049OSQ18|1.0|This is a true story. I heard the song \\"Why We Fight\\" in a restaurant this weekend. I had no idea who was performing the tune. But, recognizing the lame, indie, half wannabe Southern California, half wannabe Irish vocalist, I knew it was that guy from the Decemberists. I thought to myself, \\"I didn't know that guy had another band in the mid 90's along the same genre of the Gin Blossoms.\\" The song sounds so completely outdated. I read a defense of this album that stated they were shooting for Americana; try again boys. You'd do better sticking to the pretentious folk-progressive rock sounding stuff than attempting songs with political/social messages. Her comes the blasting from the fanbase: and begin...
0060832819|4.0|Book has been the topic of much discussion  with my friends. On the one side it is about obsession  on the other it may be a cover for one's actions.    Another great read by this greatwriter.
B004SSCWYC|5.0|Anna really deserves an Emmy this year. Playing three different roles, switching back and forth, truly an amazing woman. The Fringe team is looking stronger than every too. looking forward to seeing Astrid's character development as well.
0060589280|5.0|In addition to being a great story teller,  Mr. Coehlo's knowledge and portrayal of the  subject is very correct and real.  You get to walk more than a mile in someone else's shoes.  You end up a richer person for it.
B003Y5H50G|5.0|A blocked writer (played by Bradley Cooper) with average intelligence and a very low drive for success comes into possession of an unreleased drug that makes him a super genius. The movie's premise is that we only use a very small percentage of our brains, and the drug gets the body to use 100% of the brain.<br /><br />In the movie, the writer only has a limited supply of the drug with no way to get more. The plot thickens since the drug has side effects and others are after his supply.<br /><br />If I could give half stars, I'd give this movie a 4 1/2. It was very good, and definitely worth seeing, but there have been some movies more deserving of the full 5 stars. Still, this movie has a lot going for it. Here what's good:<br /><br />1. The premise of this movie is unique. It's a great fantasy. Who wouldn't want that level of smarts. He's able to protect himself, make a killing on Wall Street and even impress women by ordering dinner speaking Italian. Just pop a pill and you're able to pretty much conquer the world. Great concept.<br /><br />2. I like movies with smart heroes. This movie has that - well sometimes. The trouble with our hero is that without the drug he's an average guy who's sincere but not all that interesting, smart or even very likable. And when he's on the drug he's almost all about making money and having fun.<br /><br />In the characters favor, he does sincerely love a woman, and he honestly wants to be the better man she needs and deserves. Or at least to appear that way.<br /><br />Regardless of his flaws, the movie pulls you in, and you'll care about Bradley's character. This is usually essential for a movie to be good, and this movie succeeds in that. Cooper does an excellent job portraying the character in all his states.<br /><br />3. This is not a special effects movie, but the cinematography and special effects were really well done. They were a major part of moving the story along, helping you understand what was happening to Bradley Cooper's character, and helping you get inside his head.<br /><br />4. There was some suspense, action and danger that made the story exciting. The fact that the drug was going to run out and had dangerous side effects worked similar to a ticking bomb, always in the back of your mind. The movie kept to a good pace. It was almost always interesting and sometimes exciting. There were interesting plot twists. You don't always know what's coming next.<br /><br />Here's what's not quite as good:<br /><br />1. I wanted to like the lead character even more. I didn't quite identify with him personally. However others might.<br /><br />2. I would have liked the love story to have been more developed. I think it would resulted in pulling the audience into the story in a more intense way.<br /><br />3. Of course De Niro is an amazing actor, however his role was kind of small and not particularly high impact. I don't think the role was a great fit for him.<br /><br />Regardless, I'd definitely recommend this movie. It's exciting and interesting, and I'd watch it again. Anyone who likes sci-fi, thrillers and suspense will want to check this movie out.e his head.     4. There was some suspense, action and danger that made the story exciting.

0061124265|5.0|Coehlo's best. Book about life and love.  Difficult to put down, much discussed with friends.  Uplifting, if you had to give a book to someone who was down this is the book.  I have given this book to many people. ALL have really enjoyed it.  There is someone like us in the characters.   Must read for romantics too!

B0000AM6LY|5.0|Sadly, such a little known collection of great works from a sensitive song writer/fine soul singer so unknown in this country.  This is fantastic, sophisticated blue-eyed soul music with depth, sincerity, and rhythm.<br /><br />The opening cut \\"Home\\" is a very heart-felt vocal.  Not one throw-away song, Mick's vocals are inspired and so is the entire \\"unit\\" of Simply Red.<br /><br />The arrangements cook and the background singers' vocal range match perfectly with Mick in \\"Home Loan Blues\\".<br /><br />\\"Money In My Pocket\\" makes me want to dance.  It's just pure fun and joy accompanied with inspiration.<br /><br />Mick's vocal in that old song by the Stylistics, \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" will take the top of your head off.<br /><br />The \\"Sunrise\\" arrangement taken with the permission of Hall & Oates (\\"I Can't Go For That\\") made new with Mick's lyrics gives chills and makes me misty.<br /><br />I've been playing this album for years.  If I leave it for a week, I come back to it right away again.  I love this album!
0446563048|1.0|With all the publicity Zappos gets, I was excited to buy this book (Sad, want my money back). This book had very little substance.  It reads like a high school girls diary.  Contrary to what people may think... or used to think about him, he's got very little knowledge to share with us.  I learned absolutely nothing other than good publicity and pay off the right people and you'll get good reviews anywhere.  Or maybe it was his \\"Delivering Happiness\\" bus at SXSW last year.  I'm reading some of the other reviews here and makes me wonder if we've read the same book.  He never gives credit to where it's due... nothing he's doing here is original.  I was actually a fan.. ahahah.. a fan of his until reading this trash.  I actually took a picture with him at SXSW 2010.    Only discernible reason for publishing this seems to be self-aggrandizement.  Very disappointing indeed.  Please do not write any more books.
0439023521|5.0|This book was fantastic- kept me up late into the night- not being able to put it down. I had to know what would happen to Katniss next. Loved it!
0670022411|4.0|I couldnt put this book down and i cant wait for the next one!  The plot is cool, and i found many intersections with my own life - no i dont have witches and vampires in my life (sigh), but many things in this book are relevant to me,  its strange!  One criticism i have is that the main character, Diana, seems to be is eating and sleeping all the time.

B003N7WLSG|5.0|Along with the first episode of this set, this Doctor Who is among our family's favorites. The story is haunting, the masked characters just scary enough, and the line, \\"Are you my mummy?\\" has become a family inside joke. We thought Christopher Eccleston was the best Doctor until David Tennant. By the time he left the show we couldn't imagine any one taking his place but Matt Smith brings his own brand of eccentricity and talent to the role. What can I say? Doctor Who is BBC at it's absolute finest!
6304712936|5.0|I already had this movie, but on VHS.  When I found it on DVD on Amazon, I ordered it immediately.  It arrived a lot quicker than I expected.  The movie was of great quality.  I would order an DVD again from this company.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|Quite simply, the best animated DC movie out there. Although it's a cartoon, it has a dark and mature setting. I applaud the makers on a fine job!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  A definite thumbs up for the continuation of Toy Story!!  I think my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the kids!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This is a great album.  Every song on it is listen-worthy!  I can't wait to see it performed live in a month!  The harmonies are beautiful.  I think many people who wouldn't normally listen to this genre would enjoy this music.  Look at what Mumford did for bluegrass and the Avetts, too!
160059672X|5.0|\\"Sensational Bead Embroidery\\" is a great starting point for jewelry makers wanting to learn how to work with bead embroidery. We have recently begun making jewelry for my wife's small shop and have tried our hands at several different styles, but hadn't really considered bead embroidery before receiving a review copy from the publisher.<br /><br />This excellent book is good for crafters of all skill levels. It starts by covering the \\"Basic Materials And Tools\\" and \\"Stitches And General Techniques\\", which gave me confidence that this is an affordable and even enjoyable method of jewelry making. It also helps that most crafters will already own many of the required tools.<br /><br />The \\"Project\\" section includes 25 projects that vary from simplistic to extremely complicated. The instructions are very good and include details on the stitch types, bead types, and patterns required, as well as being accompanied by helpful diagrams and photos. Also, while some of the projects really aren't \\"my style\\", there is still much to be learned from trying out the different techniques.<br /><br />The \\"Gallery\\" section is filled with a beautiful and inspiring selection of photos showing a range of bead embroidered jewelry styles. I am very impressed with the quality and artistry displayed throughout the book.<br /><br />This is a great addition to my jewelry making book collection!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
030746363X|5.0|Found out about this book on Gizmodo blog posting in Nov/Dec 2010. I pre-ordered it and looked through it amusingly when I got it. I went back and read a slew of 5 star reviews on Amazon, and saw an ongoing emerging conversation... the author was a self promoting, infomercial type, and this book was a joke. I think I even saw a similar NY times review that concurred with that opinion.  I decided to give it 90 days and try just the diet as I was just edging into the \\"obese\\" range according to my BMI.  well it's been about 78 days, I lost 23 pounds, no longer take anti inflammatory meds for my knees, found the energy to exercise (furthest thing from my mind ever), and I have multiple friends who can't believe it and bought the book.  I'm sure you'll see a lot of similar comments, I have just over 15 pounds to go, and I won't even be considered overweight.  My only issue now is that I need all new clothes, even shoes, cause I don't have to wear the wider ones!  It's not so much a diet, as my hunger, my cravings and just about everything I knew about food have changed.
0061726826|4.0|Seeing the actual cover of Delirium face-to-face really surprised me - it's a lot glossier and not as electric blue as I had expected. I just thought I'd throw this thought out there first thing :P Delirium reminded me a lot like The Forest of Hands and Teeth except with a noticeable lack of zombies. But I think the amor deliria nervosa presents a BIGGER problems. I mean, how can you love zombies if there is no love to begin with? That said, it also has hints of 1984 with the whole watchful Big Brother and bad things happen to those who become self-aware and ask too many questions! I thought Lauren Oliver did an admirable job with building a world where love becomes a dirty word and all who profess it are immediately removed from society. She includes excerpts from \\"noteworthy\\" references that have been de-loved and all old stories such as Romeo & Juliet become a \\"cautionary tale\\" to those who are tempted to love. The most interesting thing was that the \\"cure\\" from amor deliria cannot be safely administered to anyone under 18 yet. Which poses a problem, obviously, since raging hormones and whatnots. Yet the system tries to squeeze the love out of everyone young - you go to school (segregated by gender), you take your exams, you get evaluated for matches, you get cured, you live thereafter devoid of any true happiness, but man, your mind is totally at peace and unperturbed. Lena gets raised this way, but she cannot help but remember her mother - now long-gone - who loved and sang and stayed uncured even though she went through the procedure three times. She doesn't want to be like her mother, even though she can remember being happier. Delirium is pretty fascinating - especially since the main characters are teenagers who are known to be on emotional rollercoasters, still in their rebellious phase, but must abide by societal restrictions eventually. Ms. Oliver presents us with Lena's case, but the other characters that surround her also fleshed out what a world without love might mean. Even the cured don't seem happy - even the cured can remember what it had been like uncured, at least in the beginning. I must warn you that the ending is shocking, and I'm more than curious to find out how the sequel plays out. Frankly I'm quite surprised to learn that Delirium is to be part of a trilogy! While this makes me glad since the ending leaves you completely slack-jawed, I was left in a pretty acceptable place with Delirium albeit cliff-hangerish.<br /><br />[...]ut love might mean.

0156027321|4.0|This took me forever to get into. I probably started this book a dozen times but was having a really hard time getting past the first few pages. But then I'd hear people say it was one of their favorite books EVER. So I thought - no matter what I have to read at least 20 pages and then see how I feel about continuing it. Well, by page 8 I was hooked. I could not put it down and I felt totally immersed into Pi's world.    What a fascinating story. He covers it all -- animals, religion, zoos, family, death, will to live, and facing your own beast inside.    I found the first half of the book to be my favorite. I loved his thoughts about zoos in general (feel the same way actually), his quest for finding God in relgion -- laugh out loud funny at times and how people relate to animals. Very interesting.    The second half was also interesting, but less so for me. I found it a bit long on the boat. I found myself reading ahead to see how much longer until he gets rescued. That said, however, I did find his relationship with the animals very curious and intriguing. I feel like I learned a lot about wild animals and their behaviors.    The third half was a complete surprise to me. Shocker ending! I'm still thinking about it and wishing that I had finished this book in time to discuss with my book club (years ago). It wasn't until after I finished that I remembered part of our discussion.    I can't stop thinking about this story. Highly recommend this book.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Now don't get me wrong, I like a good, escapist and even formulaic book just as much as the next guy.  But this book was the limit!    If you've read anything else by Dan Brown, then you've read this book.  Robert Langdon gets caught up in a whirlwind of adventure with all of the EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES as before: a smart and edgy female of interest, a fanatical madman who takes his devotion one step too far, a wise older friend, and a no-nonsense police force who both work for and against Landgon.  It's all the same.  Oh, and Langdon almost dies.   Oh, and there are puzzles to be solved that no one has solved before.  Oh, and there's a time limit.    What's worse is the payoff: whereas Da Vinci Code left me with tangible results, the ending of Lost Symbol is such a masturbatory imagining of nonsense, that you cannot help but feel completely let down for having spent time out of your precious life trudging through to the end of the book.    Dan Brown, you got cocky.  I will seriously have to consider ever buying one of your books again.
0756405890|5.0|This is the first book of The Kingkiller series, and I will warn you that it is quite a hefty book. I had been worried that I'd have no time to read this, but right from the start, I was sucked into Kvothe's story. Before I could say no, I found myself unable to put the book down without great reluctance, but I suppose my mind & body thanked me because I got through work semi-consciously the next few days.<br /><br />Kvothe is the title character, and we first see him as the owner of Waystone Inn. No one in town knows much about him, but he has stayed long enough to prove harmless. Then something happens - something strange and evil, something that should only exist in legends and nursery rhymes, something that should not be lurking about small towns. And only Kvothe recognizes this something and knows how to get rid of it. Clearly, there is more to Kvothe than he lets on.<br /><br />A traveler stumbles across Kvothe and the Waystone Inn by chance, though it turns out that he had been looking for Kvothe after hearing rumors. Chronicler had been searching for Kvothe to see if the tales were true, if Kvothe was truly Bloodless, if he was as terrible and great as they say he was.<br /><br />Hence, we arrive to the start of Kvothe's story. He was born Edema Ruh, people well-versed in all things theater and music, people who lived to travel the roads and perform to their hearts' content. An arcanist joined his traveling troupe family, and Kvothe became his student and learned about magic known as sympathy. Tragedy struck his life unexpectedly and left him an orphan, but Kvothe survived on his wits and stubbornness and a good ounce of luck. He makes way to the University to learn more about his family's murderers and to find the name of the wind.<br /><br />And I will leave you with that nutshell, though it does not come close to doing Rothfuss any justice - there was so much packed into this book, and this is only 1/3 of the story! Rothfuss is a born storyteller - the way he tells Kvothe's story is breathtaking, mesmerizing, awe-inspiring. He weaves a story with such depth and detail that I swear Kvothe must have been real.<br /><br />The only thing I am disappointed with (and it isn't really a disappointment) is how little this book revealed after one reads the jacket summary about Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe the Kingkiller - enough to entice the reader to pick up this book to find out more, yet The Name of the Wind never comes close to revealing how Kvothe ends up at Waystone Inn. Good thing this is a trilogy!<br /><br />This book lived up to the hype, and I look forward to the rest to come whenever it does come! Rothfuss is a born storyteller, and his mastery with words is clear from page 1. Anyone who enjoyed Hogwarts will find the Arcanum ten times better than that! Anyone who enjoys or plays music will appreciate how Rothfuss incorporates that into the story. I found it extremely hard to close the book and go to bed.<br /><br />[...]athtaking, mesmerizing, awe-inspiring.

B0000B1OE7|5.0|Hi, the person whom wrote the buyer beware review is a bit misleading...this print of the 10th Anniversary Edition also includes a full screen print (which is better I might add) then the cropped and often grainy widescreen conversion (which I do agree with the other post on being poor). However the updated and remixed/mastered audio tracks are worth this upgrade and truly make the difference in editions. I would opt for this one, although the specials/extras are a bit short, this is usually the case with most Manga series releases, although with that being said, the remastered picture quality in full screen and the Japanese 6.1 Track is well worth this edition.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|The boarding school children in this film appear to have been cloned; they have no families.  They are brought up -- cultivated like greenhouse plants, really -- in isolation to be proud of their mission in life, which is to donate their organs so that \\"real people\\" may live long lives.<br />It seems perfectly natural to dehumanize other people and to anthropomorphize our pets.  We want without guilt to perceive others as sinful or alien, or to exploit them as servants or workers.  We also wish for the pure affection that curdles so easily among people, but that seems forever innocent between owner and animal.  (Good doggie!)<br />It is easy for a Westerner to feel reassured that this sci-fi story of self-sacrificial, social engineering comes out of japan, the nation that invented the suicide-bomber (remember the kamikazes?), and in which workers seem willing to sacrifice themselves to shut down a nuclear power plant.  And yet, those with power in the West as well as in the East can still treat annoying or useful other classes or races as sub-human, and still breed young people to risk noble, self-sacrifice in military service.<br />The very Western twist in this tale is that the doomed children come to believe that if couples truly love each other, they can prove that they have souls, and induce the parent-figures at the school to grant them a few extra years of life.  Cannot love conquer all, or at least fight reality to a draw?  Cannot their true love for each other prove that even clones can have souls?<br />This movie moves beautifully, slowly, and gracefully across the decades, unfolding like Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\".  There are no explosions, just sublime movie-making and story-telling.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**    Let Me In is the American adaptation of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, Let The Right One In (which I haven't seen for any basis of comparison, although I have heard awesome things about it). Rated at 89% on the Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer, Let Me In did not disappoint on either the horror front or the romance front. It's not your typical vampire film, nor is it your typical boy meets girl love story. Instead, it is an amazing combination of the two, producing a compelling movie experience that is dark and terrible as it is sweet.    Owen (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee from The Road) is a young boy who gets bullied at school and spends his time entertaining himself alone in the courtyard of his apartment building. One evening, two mysterious people show up in at night and move into the building - a young girl and her father. But Abby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz from KickAss) is no ordinary twelve-year-old girl, she is a centuries year old vampire. Despite her warning to Owen that they can't be friends, they are drawn together by a shared loneliness and a relationship starts to form. The core of this film really centers around these two young people - their dialogue, their shared silent glances, their emotions, and their budding feelings for each other. Their relationship is dark and sweet because you can't help becoming invested in them and what will essentially be a doomed romance, because Abby is what she is. On that note, I thought it was incredibly poignant when we learn exactly who Abby's father is, and know that that will also be Owen's fate, should he choose to stay with Abby.    Sweetness aside, this film also has enough horror and shocking moments to have had me covering my eyes. Abby is terrifying as a quick-moving, evil-eyed vampire with her snarling blood-drenched mouth, leaving you in no doubt of the creature that she is. She rips into flesh like nobody's business, snapping necks and tearing bloody chunks out with her teeth. Even Abby's father who garbs himself from head to toe in a black garbage bag is creepy and frightening when he goes hunting for Abby. The scarier parts of this movie only add dimension to the sweeter parts, like Abby and Owen's interaction, and it just makes you feel for them more because there's no \\"happy ever after\\" for them. He'll kill for her, protect her, feed her, and she'll leave him behind when he gets too old ... just like the boy-turned-old-man before him. It's so tragic.    I thought Abby was a complex and fascinating character. She drew me in because she's doomed to be a child forever trapped in the life of this monstrous vampire, and a lot of how she is comes across as very childlike. For me, she was as good as Kirsten Dunst in Interview With A Vampire. Like Kirsten, she played the vampire versus the child amazingly well - the violent growling at her father for not getting any blood versus the sweetness of her normal girl voice is incredible. Her ability to be both monster and innocent was phenomenal. I don't think she's manipulative and scheming as suggested by other reviewers in terms of looking for someone else to take care of her. She tried to leave Owen for his own good, and ends up coming back to save his life. So that for me, erased the whole thought that her actions were contrived to make Owen fall in love with her. I think she also fell in love with him, and she knows that he protected her, too.    Owen was also a complex character, although in a different way, almost an opposite way to Abby. He's a powerless bullied kid who wants to awaken the monster inside of him - he wants to punish his tormenters. This is evident when he's stabbing the tree with a penknife, hissing \\"you scared, little girl?\\" It's interesting because he's afraid of a few kids, but yet he's able to face and even love the utter terror of a creature like a vampire.    I especially loved the juxtaposition of Let Me In with Romeo and Juliet, which Owen was reading in school,in terms of highlighting the beauty and tragedy of their relationship. Let Me In is a beautiful and terrifying film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours after I'd seen it, especially about Owen's eventual choice and the cost of such a choice. It was both bittersweet and chilling.    Superbly acted and one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen, I would rate Let Me In 5 out of 5 stars.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|Adele is way over rated. Average songs and voice. Are other artists so bad that you fall for an average at best hyped singer?
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Almost, but not quite. This lies squarely between [[ASIN:B0000640VO Amelie]] and [[ASIN:B00000K3TS The City of Lost Children]] in a number of ways: in warmth, in contact with reality, in believable characters. But, with fantasy of this calibre, you just have to take it in its own terms, whatever the heck those are.    This starts with gritty urban credibility. As a boy, Bazil's father is killed by a weapon from one dealer. As an adult, he's nearly killed by a weapon from another. Brain-injured but capable, he finds a new home among an urban salon de refusees - the people refused by the rest of society. The take him in as one of their own and with him, his mission for revenge. From there, Micmacs creates a beautiful assemblage of slapstick, political commentary, personal warmth, and intellectual goofing. Each character (and they are characters) contributes in his or her own way. Early on, though, I glommed onto the contortionist. Really, she has a central spot in all the good scenes.     Fun, fantasical, and fairly flaky, I wish this for everyone with a taste for the quirky.    -- wiredweird
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Placing my order was really easy, and the first season arrived very fast.  I'm still waiting for the second season, but amazon has been great about sending me e-mails just letting me know that they haven't forgotten about my order, they just don't have it yet.  The show is so hilarious & entertaining & was a perfect birthday gift for my boyfriend who turned me on to the show in the first place.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who appreciates humor & family dysfunction.
B00005ABX0|2.0|Maybe it would be best to just pretend 1967 never even happened for The Beach Boys.  It SHOULD have been the year they placed themselves in the \\"album as art\\" league with the rest of the heavyweights (they already had, or Brian had, with \\"Pet Sounds\\" in '66 but 1967 was the year of technicolor explosion for every major band).  It should have been the year that Brian and the Boys released their masterpiece \\"SMiLE\\" and then performed it in it's entirety at The Monterey International Pop Festival that June.  It should have been, but it wasn't.  Instead it was the year Brian finally broke down, The Beach Boys pulled out of their scheduled appearance at Monterey, and then released two hastily recorded albums only three months apart that were night and day in comparison!  And neither of them made up for the disappointment that the rock world felt when they took the place of \\"SMiLE.\\"  After 1967, The Beach Boys would be viewed in an entirely different light and not a very good one at that.  The band's September 1967 release \\"Smiley Smile\\" is a train wreck of an album, unfocused and under produced (and you thought \\"Mardi Gras\\" by CCR was bad).  The bands next release that followed in December of 1967, \\"Wild Honey,\\" is an attempt at a soul infused album but, despite a few good tracks, falls flat.  It might have saved The Beach Boys a bit of critical backlash if they had just released \\"Wild Honey\\" and skipped \\"Smiley Smile\\" altogether.  \\"Smiley Smile\\" is akin to a dinner party you've spent weeks preparing for, and when it all goes to pot at the very last minute you're forced to whip up something quick an hour or two before the guests arrive!  And it's nowhere near the masterpiece you had in mind!  \\"SMiLE\\" was going to take The Beach Boys to the next level and Brian held the key to getting them through that door.  The problem with \\"Smiley Smile\\" is that it's production lapse doesn't sound intentional, it just sounds like a band who at this point, doesn't care WHAT they're doing.  Capitol Records included \\"Good Vibrations\\" on the album in order to save it, and that song (along with \\"Heroes And Villains\\") are the only two slightly redeeming factors to the whole record.  I know there are fans out there of both of these records, and that's all fine and dandy.  But for most of us, it's too hard to separate these albums from what could have been but ultimately WASN'T.    However, I'm not going to tell Beach Boys fans NOT to buy this two-fer, just be prepared for what you might be in for.  So here's a run down of \\"The Good, The Average, and The Awful\\" for both albums:  SMILEY SMILE - THE GOOD:  \\"Heroes And Villains\\" and \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  THE AVERAGE:  \\"She's Goin' Bald,\\" \\"With Me Tonight,\\" \\"Wind Chimes,\\" \\" Gettin' Hungry,\\" and \\"Wonderful.\\"  THE AWFUL:  \\"Vegetables,\\" \\"Fall Breaks And Back To Winter,\\" \\"Little Pad,\\" and \\"Whistle In.\\"  WILD HONEY - THE GOOD:  \\"Wild Honey,\\" \\"Aren't You Glad,\\" \\"Darlin',\\" \\"I'd Love Just Once To See You,\\" \\"Let The Wind Blow,\\" \\"How She Boogalooed It,\\" and \\"Mama Says.\\"  THE AVERAGE:  \\"Country Air,\\" \\"A Thing Or Two,\\" and \\"Here Comes The Night.\\"  THE AWFUL:  \\"I Was Made To Love Her.\\"    EPILOGUE - As you know (and if you don't, well, you will now), the original \\"SMiLE,\\" put together as best as humanly possible by Mark Linett, is coming out on Nov. 1st of this year!  Five tracks have been leaked in various ways, both by You Tube and The Beach Boys Facebook page, and all five sound amazing.  The new mix of \\"Vega-Tables\\" blows the \\"Smiley Smile\\" version out of the water and across the landscape!  The new mixes of \\"Heroes And Villians,\\" \\"Cabinessence,\\" and \\"Wonderful\\" sound as they should have back in 1967.  \\"Good Vibrations\\" is even better too!  The 11-1-11 release of \\"SMiLE\\" is either going to do one of two things with fans perception of \\"Smiley Smile.\\"  It will either A) completely turn fans off of the record to where they'll never be able to listen to it again or B) make them accept \\"Smiley Smile\\" and think of it as a sort of loose, give-away album that The Beach Boys threw together in wake of releasing their masterpiece in the summer of '67.  Had The Beach Boys released \\"SMiLE\\" back in '67, \\"Wild Honey\\" could have followed it honestly as many major bands then were scaling down after reaching their psychedelic zenith.  But instead of climbing to the top of the mountain as The Beatles did, The Beach Boys chose to go around it, and back then it didn't work that way.  Hopefully Nov. 1st will restore fans who kinda let go of the band when \\"Smiley Smile\\" came out decades ago.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|Just what I was promised in a timely manner. Very fun movie. I keep watching it over and over. Not bluray, but still very good quality.
B000001FTA|5.0|This album when it hit the scene summed up where the band was heading. It is my favorite Thin Lizzy recording and the guitars just soar on the harder rock tunes but the ballads are solid too. Everything on this recording fits nice and snug and it is a testament to the era it came from. I wore out my vinyl copy so I bought the CD and play it when Im on a road trip these days.
B0034G4OY0|4.0|A beautiful, thoughtful, and sobering human drama. Cécile de France (High Tension) is simply wonderful. I was captivated whenever she was on the screen. Young actors Frankie and George McLaren give terrific performances as Marcus/Jason. I was also won over by Matt Damon and Bryce Dallas Howard. There's really no weak link here among the main players.    It's no surprise audiences are mixed on the film. I have a feeling most are expecting a more eerie, supernatural thriller type of movie, ala The Sixth Sense. I personally prefer the more intimate picture Eastwood has crafted. It's all rather low-key, but this is a very \\"nice\\" film that I enjoyed a lot.
B003UESJF6|5.0|...Try being a Super Villain. That is what the film 'Megamind' is all about. Dreamworks took the classic good vs. evil battle and gave all of us the answer to that burning question. So, what exactly does happen when evil finally triumphs? Megamind is Metro City's most notorious villain and all he wants to do is finally thwart Metroman or as he prefers to call him...Mr. Goody Two-shoes. After years and years of planning and plotting he finally did it! Then suddenly, something unusual happens...Megamind has nothing to do! He then realizes...there is only one thing left to do, create a new hero. Now, he has that accomplished it looks like the new hero has plans of his own and they are not for the good of mankind.<br /><br />This film was such a great comedy. While Pixar gave us 'The Incredible', 'Megamind' is a completely different story that plays on the fan boy fantasies. Throw a great comedic cast together and some of the best CGI Dreamworks has given us in years and you get a classic. Will Ferrel, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt give us a great combination of laughs and heart. It brings us into the minds of heroes and villains and shows us that they actually are more than just crazy gadgets and cheesy monologues. They are people and when the action takes a back seat in this film you see it and it is done quite well. Probably the biggest surprise in this film is David Cross as the voice of Minion. He always runs hot and cold with the average movie goers, but this time he shines and gives us such awesome moments in the film. It's the smart comedy and the timing of the jokes that makes this movie a real winner.<br /><br />If you are a parent looking for a movie for your young ones or if you are a classic comic book geek 'Megamind' delivers a one two punch. It was one of the most overlooked films of last year and a great ride from beginning to end.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Love this musical with Judy Garland! If you are new to watching older movies this is a great one to start with. One of my favs.
B003SLE4DW|5.0|There were a few spots that dragged, but the action set-pieces in this book were GREAT. Especially the prison scene, and a scene that takes place during a rain storm. The opening scene, too. Just go read the opening scene, where he gets arrested. It's a pretty good example of what the book has to offer. This is the best sort of discovery for me, finding a book that is this exciting and learning that there are tons more by the same author, about the same character!<br /><br />The good points:<br /><br />- Interesting hero. Not a perfect super-hero type. Has his flaws, and messes up.<br />- A really great sense of action. The writer was a TV writer, I guess? That may explain why his action scenes are so visual and exciting. I really enjoyed them.<br />- interesting bad guy plot. Won't spoil it.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />- female characters are just there to be hostages or killed. hopefully this improves in later books.<br />- a few eye roll moments. especially the fate of the blues singer 'blind blake'<br />- based around a fairly ridiculous coincidence.<br />- the kindle edition costs a lot more than buying this at any used bookstore would. An older mass market book like this would be very easy to find. I really do prefer to buy it in a way where the author gets money, but wish it were more reasonably priced. Especially if I'm going to be buying a bunch of these Reacher books.<br /><br />But the good far outweighed the bad, for my tastes.

B000A32KJQ|5.0|Great music from grat musicians. Manu Catche plays great every time on every record. Neighbourhood was made with a group of jazz players like Marcin Wasilewski, Jan Garbarek, Tomasz Stanko and many others who add their unique touch to every note on this record. I would also recommend watching Number One video, not only pop stars can make a great picture ; )
B001GCUNYO|4.0|ust actually got around to watching this and it turned out to be a pretty good soild action film. For fans who like Bourne Indentity and \\"24\\" this will fit in just fine. The central character is played by a great actor Liam Nelson whose past involves \\"The Goverment\\" using his \\"special skills\\". He's given that up since his world revolves his daughter which is now living the life of the rich & famous thanks to her mom. The daughter has no clue what dear Dad use to do.    Daughter decides a trip to \\"France\\" is needed and from there it's one pissed off Dad (Liam Nelson) becoming  one-man wrecking crew in order to save his daughter who has been kidnapped for selling on the human market. In a race against time (96 hrs before she's gone off the grid) Nelson enacts a \\"24\\" tempo and lets nothing get in his way. At each turn it seems the world of Human Slavery and underworld prostituion becomes more evil and dark. For anyone who is a \\"Dad\\", you want to cheer Nelson on to just \\"kick-the-crap\\" out of every single one of them which he gladly does.    The film is visually solid with a nice DTS track to it. The fight scenes (which are plenty of) actually does produce some nice low end along with some gun battles. It's not say Rambo sound but the hand-to-hand combat scenes really do sound and look good. I'm giving it 4 of 5 Stars but on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 8.8. Good story, good action and good actor in Nelson.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|This season was simply brilliant.  I can't understand why some people felt the need to have every single question answered.  The show ended with a focus on the characters which is what the show was always about at its core.  Nobody would have continued to watch the show to find out what was going on on the island if we didn't like the characters.  For me personally, the show ended the right way.  The end of the show made us all remember that these people went through a traumatic experience together and that in coming together again in the sideways world they were able to acknowledge the importance of the fellow castaways in the most difficult period of their lives.
0756404738|5.0|I have seen many 3 star reviews from people who all agreed that Mr. Rothfuss' writing is beyond measure, but how they were disappointed in what was included in this book. Frankly, I think these people had just worked up their expectations too high for this second book during the quite average four year wait, wondering why more wasn't included and how it will all be suitably wrapped up in book 3.  This seems ridiculous, as we only have a very few ambiguous hints as to whats upcoming, just like after the first book, and as I'm sure most here will realize once the hype has died down, this book is just as great as the first.  While I understand some people felt the storyline plodded along a bit, I personally didn't feel this, perhaps because I was in no rush to get to the end and just enjoyed Pat's storytelling.  So if you really need these reviews to tell you anything, or help you make a decision on whether to read this second one, then ask yourself these two questions:  1) Did you enjoy the first book? If you haven't read it, go do that now. If you didn't enjoy it, and there are people out there who didn't, then this definitely won't appease you.  2) Are your expectations for this book so high that it's unlikely to satisfy you? If so, go read something else and come back to this when you're ready.  Trust us, it's worth it. No matter whether we put 3 or 4 or 5 stars down, we all really loved it, we'll probably reread it, and we'll certainly be there for the third book with hyped up expectations once more.
B00062RCBW|5.0|The product was described accurately and was received promptly.  This is the original release of the complete series, seasons 1-7.  It was received unopened, unused, undamaged and in the factory-sealed, plastic wrappings for each year as well as the larger containing box.    High-quality cardboard boxes protect each of the individual packages.  Inside each of the packages there is a separate good-quality container for the DVDs which folds out to reveal the DVDs which are snapped securely in place.    My only complaint is minor and it is that it can be difficult to remove the folding DVD packages from the main DVD boxes.

0061989142|4.0|As a young adult, I think is a good book for anyone trying to update their wardrobe. The book has many helpful tips on how to shop for jewelry, makeup and purses, and also where to wear this bag, or when to wear a certain make up look. I wish that this book was more focused on girls in high school, since Conrad does have an audience appeal with the teens of America. She does include a paragraph for teenagers but it is limited in information and could be better. Lauren's book does include great style tips, and great tips for cleaning out her closet. I do recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find their own style or maybe looking to just improve their fashion taste. I think that this book does deserve the praise, and I feel I will be rereading it for years to come.
B00368PSN2|4.0|A displaced warrior type outlander from another world is in pursuit of his nemesis, a dragon type creature called a Moorwen. The outlander is captured and later befriended by local Vikings after proving himself. The Vikings are confronted by the same creature. So Vikings and outlander team combine resources to squelch the dragon before becoming dragon-chow.<br /><br />As viewers we have fun saying stay in the car or fort. Kibitzing is allowed.<br /><br />Of course we have the standard upstart pretender to the throne rivaled by a stranger of unknown origins both interacting with the king's daughter. So a sort of watered down love story parallels the fighting action.<br /><br />This is a crossover genre of Beowulf and aliens. Each doing a fair job of integration. For other viewers it is still tolerable. Defiantly worth a viewing.
B00006J9OT|2.0|Does this woman have any vocal range or vibrato at ALL?  Or does she sing every single song in the same key, tempo and way?  If she is the standard that other Jazz \\"divas\\" (Pardon the cliche.) are expected to live up to nowdays, then Jazz is seriously slipping.  Jaimee Paul can outsing Krall ANY day of the week and with 20x more flava!  She (Krall) may be an adroit pianist, but her voice leaves a LOT to be desired.  Vocally, she chops the ends of every word/note short and in a live setting, I can't imagine her showing any more (or less) personality than she shows in her music already.<br /><br />With Shirley Horn, one feels warm all over.  However, with Krall, there is no warmth; just cold, gray, lifeless and dull EVERYTHING.  Granted, her voice is sexy with its raspiness, but by NO MEANS is it enough to tow the line for years to come.  She could use a Red Bull and some vocal coaching in MY opinion.<br />A personality wouldn't hurt either.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|James (this time Daniel Craig) is pretending not to be upset by the demise of his girl by an unscrupulous person, finds that that person is a part of a cabal of unknown origin or purpose. Now he must get revenge and dismantle the cabal before it dismantles the British secret service. On the way he comes across a girl, Camille (Olga Kurylenko) that may or may not be on his side but may also hold a secret of her own.<br /><br />The film as all the reasons one watches Bond movies. There is action and story and girls and global plots. Yet this film harkens back to the original Bond's where we had more acting and personal interaction. Not the snide attitude and out of this world gadgets taking front stage.  There are no gimmicks or weird bad guys, just a mystery with a twist and people just trying to do their job.  Most of the cast may be different from the other Bond movies, but you will recognize the characters.  When it is over you feel that you watched a real Bond movie, and you have.
B0041VT6HW|1.0|This movie had alot of potential - an excellent cast, some excellent themes, and an original story, albeit a comic book movie.  Think of this as a Western-version of Batman.  That's all there is to it.<br /><br />Jonah is a former Confederate Soldier whose family is brutally murdered by his former commander who blames him for the death of his son and Jonah's best friend.  In a very The Crow meets Spawn meets The Lone Ranger mstory line, Jonah is saved by Indians who give him, get this, MYSTICAL POWERS!!!!  Sounds amazing?  It's not.  In fact, my capitalization is more compelling than the actual movie.<br /><br />Let's see, Jonah's Mystical Powers are (1) he can regenerate from being injured, (2) he can touch dead people and bring them back to life, (3) he can use his bird vision to see through the eyes of a raven and (4) he can force you to not want to watch the movie.  Its almost as if Josh Brolin speaks to us beyond the third wall, begging us to watch one of his better movies.  Oh and Megan Fox gets thrown in for Boobs, but not much else.<br /><br />So anyway, Jonah is recruited by the President of the United States to find out what his former commander is up to - some dastardly awesome weapon of mass destruction, before it can be used against Washington DC.  I swear, they ripped most of the story off from Wild Wild West.<br /><br />Yada yada yada, Jonah prevents the destruction of Washington DC, saving the American way of life while conveniently and painfully paving the way for sequels...<br /><br />I found many aspects of the story intriguing, but it did not hold on to the intrigue.<br /><br />If you were unlucky enough to recieve this as a gift, I would suggest burying it in the backyard if you can't exchange it or sell it.  Regift it.<br /><br />This movie is not worth seeing.  Wait for it to hit cable.  Or don't.
0811870413|4.0|I agree with others - somewhat verbose and a little difficult to parse the recipes from the story telling, but that said, the techniques work and they result in wonderful bread. I really like \\"turning\\" instead of kneading. I only wish there were more recipes and suggested variations and less chatter and more bold print and headings so I can find the recipes amongst the chatter. I would recommend this book to anyone who has gotten the \\"bread baking bug\\" as I have but it shouldn't be the only book in your library.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This was one of the most disturbing, thought provoking and inspirational movies that I have seen in a very long time.  It has developed my faith in God, intensified my study of the word of God and has solidified my relationship with my Heavenly Father.  This is definitely one of my favorite serious movies of all times!  Denzel Washington is phenomenal as an actor and producer of this chef d'oeuvre! He never ceases to amaze me with his knowledge, creativity and humanness! Every time I look at this movie that I purchased for my personal library, I see and learn more than before.  Thanks for teaching me and strengthening me to see and endure the journeys of life through my spiritual eyes!  This is a must have dvd in ones great movies archives!  Some parts of the movie are very graphic and violent but essential to comprehend the story line.  Again, Denzel is brillant as Eli!!!!! I love this movie!  In fact, I will watch it again this weekend!  I so believe in the word and the message of the word of God, more than ever before.  Thanks for all of the revelations!!!!!  A must see movie...several times!!!!!  That's why I purchased it!
031261246X|5.0|I write technology and network security books, articles, newsletters and white papers for a living. Reading for fun is one of my guilty pleasures. But lately I've been disappointed in the deteriorating quality of the fiction books that I read. Even many of my long-time favorite novelists seem to have gotten sloppy, and most of the new books are badly written from a technical point of view, fail to bring anything fresh to overused plotlines, and/or aren't able to keep the story moving, make me care about the characters or wrap up the plot elements into a coherent whole.<br /><br />There are, however, a few folks who can still tell a story. The two books I read immediately preceding Zero Day were by Neal Stephenson and Orson Scott Card, old standbys who never let me down. Those guys are tough acts to follow, and as I opened up Mark's book (in the Kindle app on my Galaxy Tab, if anyone cares), I felt a mixture of eager anticipation and a smidgen of worry.  Mostly, I was excited to embark on reading a novel written by someone I actually knew personally; that doesn't happen every day.<br /><br />If you don't know who Mark Russinovich is, check out his bio on Wikipedia. Pretty impressive technical creds, huh? I knew that Mark really knows his stuff when it comes to computers, so I was looking forward to (finally!) reading a novel about technology that wouldn't have me stopping every few pages to shake my head and say \\"no, no, no - it doesn't work that way.\\" (Dan Brown's Digital Fortress is just one example of a technothriller that, despite the author's storytelling skills, I couldn't enjoy because I wasn't able to get past the technical mistakes).<br /><br />The worry? I knew it was a first novel, and I know very well that being very, very smart doesn't necessarily ensure that a person can write in a compelling way. Writing fiction is very different from writing technical papers. And in fact, some of the smartest people I know write some of the most boring material. And I also knew, from my own efforts, that writing a novel is hard work. Writing a novel well is even harder. Would he be able to pull it off?<br /><br />I'm going to be brutally honest here: The opening scene didn't exactly impress me and make me want to read more.  Oh, I know starting things off with some gratuitous sex is supposed to be a sure-fire technique for grabbing readers' attention and it probably works just fine with the young male geeks who are likely to make up a large part of this book's audience. But if you aren't a member of that group and you don't really particularly like that sort of thing, hang in there. It's all over in a page and a half and once we get that out of the way, the story starts to take off into the wild blue yonder. Literally. Of course, John Nance is one of my favorite novelists and aviation is one of my special interests so I'm always a sucker for a good barely-averted-air-disaster scene. Scene 2, played out in the cockpit of British Airways Flight 188, had me hooked by the third paragraph. And from there on out, it was a wild and wooly ride.<br /><br />As I made my way through the book, it only got better and better. Many years ago, I devoured all the popular novels written by Arthur Hailey, whose Airport and Runway Zero-Eight were my favorites (aviation buff, remember).  His other titles, such as Hotel (about the hospitality industry), Wheels (about the automobile industry), The Moneychangers (about the banking industry), and Strong Medicine (about the pharmaceutical industry) also kept me up late for many nights in the 70s and 80s. Zero Day is written in the same format as Hailey's books, shuffling the scene back and forth between many different localities and characters, with one strong protagonist tying it all together.  Great literature? No - but highly entertaining and also informative, thanks to all the research that went into them. Is it a formulaic style? Maybe so, but it's an effective one. It can also be a maddening one ifit's not handled just right - I've read more than one book written in this style that fell apart completely because the author couldn't seem to juggle the plethora of subplots or keep all those characters' personalities consistent. I'm happy to report that Mark did a great job of managing this shifting landscape.<br /><br />The plot is built around a rapidly evolving set of incidents involving computer system failures that result in serious situations, some of which are only costly in monetary terms, but many of which are life-threatening. Our emergent hero is Jeff Aiken, mild-mannered computer expert who left the frustrations and bureaucratic red tape of his government job (in the CIA, no less) for the private sector, where he makes lots of money doing damage control and clean-up after corporate security breaches, somewhat akin to the way Red Adair sweeps into town to put things right after an oilwell fire. Jeff and his former government colleague, Dr. Daryl Haugen (the somewhat stereotypical beautiful blonde computer genius who wants to be admired for her brains instead of her body) come to realize that the incidents - ranging from the decimation of a law firm's network to the failure of a 787 jetliner's computerized systems to a \\"glitch\\" in a hospital's records system that causes several patient deaths from improper medication - are all related and part of a cyberterrorist attack.  The race to track down the bad guys and prevent the worst from happening is on.<br /><br />The story is deadly serious, and it will keep you awake, turning the pages late into the night, as you worry over what's going to happen in the book (and may also keep you awake nights after you've finished it, worrying about just how close we are to a real-life version of these events). There are also moments of comic relief. As the male chauvinist DHS bureaucrat - who's involved in some clandestine activities of his own - watches  Daryl walk away, he ruminates over how \\"these computer types were always getting worked up over nothing\\" - and how \\"the few attractive women among them were the worst.\\"  As a woman in the male-dominated computer security field, I can't help grinning and thinking I've met this guy before - a few times over.<br /><br />When I read a novel, especially a first novel, and more especially a first novel about computer-related matters written by a computer expert, I can't help wondering how much of himself the author put into his main character.  Jeff taught at Carnegie-Mellon; Mark got his Ph.D. from the same university. Jeff is an entrepreneur who has built a successful business tracking down malware; Mark co-founded Winternals Software. They say every first novel is autobiographical to some extent, so it's hard not to see Jeff as a fictionalized version of Mark. But that only adds to the mystique.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great read. If you want to get nit-picky, there are enough typos to be annoying - as is the case with almost every novel I read these days, including those by big name authors such as Stephen King and John Grisham.  These are little things, such as \\"then\\" when it should have been \\"than\\" or missing punctuation.  Some are the types of mistakes that get introduced in the editing process. Darn, how I wish these publishers would let me proofread these books before they go to print (hint, hint).<br /><br />I noticed that one reviewer complained about getting bogged down in the technical details. Maybe it's because I'm in the tech industry and already have an understanding of these things, but I thought the technical issues were explained very well, translating the techno jargon to mainstream terms and using analogies that should be easy for anyone, tech savvy or not, to understand. If you're an IT pro, you'll get into it on several different levels - but don't be afraid to recommend it to your friends and relatives who aren't computer professionals (Do, however, be prepared to answer their concerned questions aboutwhether all this could really happen when they find themselves scared to death by what takes place in the novel).<br /><br />At $14.08 for the hardcover or $11.99 for the electronic edition (on Amazon), this book is a bargain, for both its entertainment and its educational value. Don't just buy one; buy a second one for a friend.\\"the few attractive women among them were the worst.\\"  As a woman in the male-dominated computer security field, I can't help grinning and thinking I've met this guy before - a few times over.

B003UESJHO|5.0|The idea that a life that is truely average can make a film so outstanding is what movie making is all about. The story is there, beginning to end, and offers the highs and lows any good story should produce. The ending was inspiring and the acting supurb. I was enthralled from the get go. The family dynamics, dynasty and the end result of hard living and hard work really pays off in the end. I can't say enough about the film. Congratulatoins to everyone involved.
B004P9FAK2|1.0|Ultimate Edtion? It should be called the Ultimate Ripoff edition!! I guess all you have to do to be the Ultimate Edition is add a couple of minutes of behind the scenes footage and a fancy card. Sorry WB your not ngetting anymore of my money for the same movie I alredy have. You got me to buy movies 3 and 4 thinking they were the extended cuts. After all when you released movies 1 and 2 you said all the Ultimate Editions would have extended cuts of all the movies. My fault for not doing any reseach on line first. I just never though you would release a Ultimate Edition with the same movie I already have. I guess I under estamated WB,s greed.
0307716988|4.0|My daughter is enjoying the book very much.  It has helped her to see Michael Jackson as he really was.
1400049628|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a light read, but not so light that you won't learn something.  Oh sure, you'll be amused by the author's descriptions of appropriate weapon choice and survival tactics in different terrain, but the humor helps you effectively learn what to do, and what not to do, in the event of a zombie apocalypse.  For instance, I learned that a crow bar makes a great weapon and can also double as a tool for when you need to pry open things, let's say locked doors to gun and ammo shops, and a shotgun is NOT the best weapon in the event of an attack.  However, I did learn that my theory about holing up in the local Costco during a zombie apocalypse isn't such a bad idea (but there are better places).  Also, the historical attacks referenced in the back of the book can be used as case studies so you know your plan for escape and survival is a good one.<br /><br />And, as any good zombie piece of art must include, social commentary can be found as well.  Recommendations like \\"get into shape\\" and \\"learn to let go of your cherished possessions\\" are wry comments on the state of Americans and mirror the constant barrage of media messaging to the same tune.<br /><br />So, if you love zombies and love some good tongue-in-cheek humor, then you'll love this book.
030745455X|3.0|The second book in the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" is not nearly as engaging as it's predecessor.  I am not a particular fan of mystery novels, but the first book had me enthralled. This book, however, has a plot that is slower, and an enigma that is not as worthwhile. Do not even venture near the movie, since it is twice as disappointing.
0205313426|5.0|This book is worth reading several times. Reading advice on style has caused me to think explicitly about style when writing, even if I am not thinking about exactly what Strunk and White said. This is like how after carefully reading a book on manners one might not remember every rule in the book, but might then think more about manners and thus be more courteous.<br /><br />The opinions of authors who have thought long and deeply about a topic are worth reading, even if one doesn't agree with all the opinions.<br /><br />The only rule that could cause problems is Rule 17, \\"Omit needless words\\". I think it takes experience to apply this rule well, and I recommend that a beginning writer have someone whose style they respect check their work to see what should be cut down and where more explanation or elaboration is needed.<br /><br />This is not a book of grammar. For that I like Otto Jespersen's \\"Essentials of English Grammar\\".<br /><br />White's essay \\"An approach to style\\" itself makes the entire book worth buying. \\"The language is perpetually in flux: it is a living stream, shifting, changing, receiving new strength from a thousand tributaries, losing old forms in the backwaters of time. To suggest that a young writer not swim in the main stream of this turbulence would be foolish indeed, and such is not the intent of these cautionary remarks. The intent is to suggest that in choosing between the formal and the informal, the regular and the offbeat, the general and the special, the orthodox and the heretical, the beginner err on the side of conservatism, on the side of established usage. No idiom is taboo, no accent forbidden; there is simply a better chance of doing well if the writer holds a steady course, enters the stream of English quietly, and does not thrash about.\\"
B004NOH9LW|4.0|I was somewhat anxious about watching this movie.  What could Clint Eastwood possibly bring to this genre?  But going from his past treatment of dramatic stories I went ahead.  I was not disappointed.  This is a very interesting story of three lives and how they come together.  Two by tragedy (Marie Lelay, the twins-Marcus/Jason, and one by a gift-George Lonegan.  This movie takes twists and turns but Eastwood never loses the viewer.  My only distant complain is that as good as Matt Damon is as an actor, I feel this story deserved a different kind of actor to totally fulfill it.  If the right lead actor was picked for this movie I would have given it a solid five stars.  This is a totally enjoyable and entertaining movie.
B004FGMV0W|3.0|With the decline in modern-rock music, and 'digital pop music' on the rise, Avril Lavigne is cornered. Leaving her with no choice other than to revert to the sound of her earlier work, but still wrestling with herself to be distinguished as 'the new Avril'. The dark, and moody girl she was not so long ago hardly represents who she is at this point in her career. As a result, reverting back completely is not an option. It also Iis not a sound that will be commercially successful in our current world of... music [???]<br /><br />'Goodbye Lullaby' is basic, simple, plain, dated, repetative, and boring. The songs have very little substance. The album is 'one topic', from beginning to end. During these rockless times, Avril Lavigne is struggling to be creative. Her songwriting is unimaginative, and comes off as forced. The lyrics on this album are about the simplest, or most predictable things. 'I love You', a three syllable song title with a narriw concept. Considering how far she's come in hers career (26 years old/4th album), she should be ashamed. There are richer things to sing about now that she's 'becoming of age', songs to inspire, the state of the world, empowerment, righteousnes, VENGEANCE (to a lesser degree) and so forth. Of course, with a few 'ridiculous' songs thrown in to balance the mood. Although Avril Lavignes first 2 albums had a bit more structure, there were still subjects he hasn't touched on. There are no excuses for this type of work from her. The music on this release is more fit for a 15 yearold girl who's demoing, and working to get her music out. Not a grown woman approaching 30, who's established in the music industry, who's been through divorce and a considerable amount of life's highs and lows.<br /><br />Let's talk vocals. She sounds like a 7th grader. She's high pitched, kiddie sounding, and whiney. Even more so than when she actually was 'in' school. The songs here don't help with this issue at all. I also want to touch on the music itself, It's not a concentrated sound. The music does not sound wholsome or BIG, the sound is not rich, It's very flat and ONE dimensional. I notice this with many other artists today aswell, Not just Avril. There are so many things I want to elaborate on but it's just too much.<br /><br />On a positive note, I \\"would\\" like to say that, I prefer this album over (The Best Damn Thing). It's far more listenable in my opinion. I find that both albums go hand and hand. There's no balance in either one, One os \\"OverTheTop\\" and the other is sort of bland. So to create that balance, You need the mellowness of this one, with the hyperness of the other. Fuse them together. I'm disappointed in this release but there's nothing I can do. I can either wait for the follow-up or just accept this for everything it's not. There's so much more I want to touch on but it's not that deep. I gave the album 3 stars because the album is listenable and easy to sing along to. I also like a few songs on here \\"Push\\" \\"When You Were Here\\" \\"What The Hell\\" and the chorus in \\"Smile\\". If you have a chance, check out \\"Everybody Does\\" from Martina McBride's 2005 release (Waking Up Laughing). You'll notice Avril Lavigne's \\"Everybody Hurts\\" sounds exactly the same.<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br />Pocha Dotoncentrated sound.

B0007PLLQ0|5.0|This movie is spectacular! I absolutely love it. First there are 2 versions the Director's Cut and the Tangerine Dream. Personally I loved the Director's Cut because it gave more dialogue between the Villain and the Damsel (Lili). Sure the Tangerine version had some good parts like the introduction,when Darkness seeks guidance and when he has the last laugh. But what I love most is Jerry Goldsmith's musical score which is essentially beautiful. With the Tangerine version it seems that the movie is rushed and that the dialogue is short and misses important parts. I was obsessed with the movie for a while...But it has the good vs evil and heaven and hell theme to it for those who love a good fantasy.   You will not be disappointed with this magical filled tale of heavenly beings as well as demonic creatures. Tom Cruise, Tim Curry and Mia Sarah did a wonderful job! The makeup is superb and the scenery is outstanding. I highly recommend :) Enjoy

B003XQ2VOG|4.0|I happen to own seven of these Fox quad sets.Most I have purchased for $10 at Target which is a good value for any classic movie fan. Keep 'em coming Fox! Each movie has its own disc (no flippers). The theme on this set seems to be Action/adveture. One of the greatest sci-fi classics is found here in Fantastic Voyage. The special effects are quite remarkable considering there was no CGI then. Having a great cast including screen goddess Racquel Welch doesn't hurt either. The only weak entry in the bunch is The Lost World. The presence of Claude Raines is the only saving grace in this one. Kind of disappointing also is the inclusion of the non anamorphic disc of Towering Inferno. They could have easily used the disc that is part of the Special Edition instead. It is anamorphic which means that it has the proper ratio but fills up more of a widescreen TV.
B004MPJZ1O|5.0|I know one thing this movie should be shown to men who have the tendencies of a rapist...Especially those who are in prison and about to be released. It would make them think twice about raping again. The scene where she killed the sheriff, I would have left him alive and taunted him so much that he'd wish he was dead. After all he had more to lose then those other idiots, his family and job. It was obvious he used his position to do dirt and get away with it. Oh I would have still stuck the rifle where the sun don't shine so that he couldn't sit for a month or twelve. But keeping him so scared of his family and job finding out what he did would be the icing on the cake (Hey maybe another remake with this story line could be good. The title should be \\"In Deep Spit\\").
B000LC55F2|3.0|I have a very mixed opinion of Christopher Nolan's movies. I loved his first indie-film 'Following' as well as 'Batman Begins' but 'The Prestige' marked a turning point in Nolan's career. While there's clever writing and plot-twists abound, gone is the fun and sense of wonder both from the world of magic as well as Nolan's filmmaking.<br /><br />The Prestige concerns two rival magicians: Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) who used to be friends and worked together as ringers for another magician until a personal tragedy sparks a feud between them. What follows is a series of elaborate illusions, sabotages, seductions, and finally murder as each magician tries to ruin the other while seeking to discover the secrets behind the other's illusions. This sounds like a promising story and at first it's quite engaging with great period detail (of turn-of-the-century England and America) and some clever behind-the-scenes insights to the magic tricks of it's era. However as the movie goes on, the plot (adapted by Christopher and Jonathon Nolan from Christopher Priest's novel) starts getting twisted and bizarre as illusions are revealed and the film's credibility starts to crumble. Some people thought the big reveal at the end was clever. I thought both magicians' \\"reveals\\" unconvincing (even in a movie sense) and the experience as a whole feels fake.<br /><br />The one thing Christopher Nolan excells at in all his films is his casting. Both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are well cast and convincing as the two (unlikeable) magicians. Michael Caine is a welcome presence as Cutter, an engineer who knew both men but works mostly for Angier. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Olivia, Angier's assistant who falls for Borden. Surprisingly, David Bowie and Andy Serkis give the best performances in the movie as Nikola Tesla and his assistant Mr. Alley.<br /><br />As usual I'm in the minority with my low opinion of 'The Prestige'. I like the idea of using stage magic as a movie theme and this film started out really strong. However, too much revealed too early, no one to relate to and an unconvincing finale make for a bitter movie experience.and this film started out really strong.

B003YV64OI|5.0|Pretty much exactly what you'd expect.  Runs great and cool.  Comes with a fan that automatically adjusts speeds and is working incredibly well so far.  Seems to be in incredibly good buy, not really top end but not very expensive either.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I have seen the White Stripes live 5 times in person.  They were a great live show.  So I was so happy to get this DVD.  It shows them raw and amazing. I love this DVD.  The crowd is great and Jack and Meg are simply killing it.  Although they got better musically on there later tours.  The energy at this show is second to non.  I can watch it over and over again.  This is a band that will be missed.  But thank God this period was captured on film.  A must see.  *****
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a real horror film...and it's all true. Charles Ferguson does a masterful job explaining how government complicity since Reagan's presidency and the rapacity of Wall Street destroyed the world's economies. No has spent a day in jail or paid a cent, as Ferguson said when the won the Academy Award for Best Documentary this year. The average person may not understand the ins and outs of how Wall Street ripped us off, but you'll get a really good look at how they pulled off the biggest financial scam in the world's history. This is an absolute must-see.
0312370849|5.0|I tend to avoid Holocaust literature because I find the stories to be too horrifying.  However, I was able to read and finish this book because the brutal Holocaust details are broken up by the main character's narration of her quest for the history behind a family who once inhabited an apartment and her personal transformation as she learns about Sarah's life.<br /><br />I am writing this review a few months after reading the book and am amazed that its story still vividly comes back to my memory.  The author did a beautiful job conveying the plight of the French Jewish children during WWII, a population whose stories receive little press.  Sarah's Key also described the heroic acts of the non-Jews who sacrificed their lives to save the Jews.  Moreover, Sarah's story left me with appreciation that \\"survivors\\" of the Holocaust often survived only in body and not in soul.

B00333NCTM|5.0|If you are thinking about getting this book, think no more and just buy it. This book is worth the money, I do not write reviews but this book was great. The book is told by Ozzy himself and you can hear his voice as you read every word in the book. This book will make you laugh, send you into shock that he is still alive, and show you a side of The Prince of Darkness you did not know existed. I have been a fan of Ozzy since I was 11 and I have read a lot of books by Rock Stars, but this book was more than just crazy stories about a Drunk and Drugged out rock star. Even if you are not a fan you will love the truth and pure rawness of this book. I read the book in 5 days I could not put it down, you will find yourself laughing your arse at so many different spots in this book. Ozzy sets all the rumors straight in this book, so think no more and start reading this book today, you will not be sorry I swear. By far the best book I have read this year! If you have ever had any issues with addiction Ozzy's life shows you that it is never to late to get clean and a great inspiration to stay clean, no matter what the addiction is. I can not say it enough, GREAT GREAT BOOK.

B002QKZLZ6|3.0|This case does just why it is meant to do. It protects the headset while not in use and has a clip to wear on your belt. However, it does not have a hole in the bottom so the headset cannot be charged while in the case. If the headset could be charged while being protected I would have given it 4 stars or more.

1401307787|5.0|A wonderful guide to meditation for the beginner, as well as the \\"experienced\\". In this 10th anniversary edition of his book, Jon Kabat-Zinn explains in his insightful way, how mindfulness in everyday life can lead to greater peace, joy, and happiness in each and everyone who is willing to practice.<br />Meditation does not mean burning candles and incense; chanting or even making a \\"great connection with a higher power\\". It is much more simple than that;as the author makes clear in his in depth look at slowing down, finding time to \\"go within\\", being aware of your own breath and your surroundings. His writing style reminds me of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Zen Buddhist monk. With saying that, I must clarify that this book is not recommending becoming a Buddhist, or any direct correlation with any religious sect. It does however, recommend slowing down in this life's hectic pace, going within, finding oneself, and experiencing life, in full consciousness. This is not a book, meant to rush through reading either. I would say to anyone, just give it a try.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|One of the very WORST films in years!...music and background noise took over the dialog...the soundtrack was just terrible...how this film won awards and acclaim is beyond me. Mark, the leading character in this film talked so fast his speech sounded like a foreign language...There were so many flashbacks it made it difficult to follow at times...a long boring film that we could not wait for it to end...so glad it cost me only a $1.00 to rent at REDBOX. I gave it one star because of the photography of Harvard and Cambridge...other than that it would have gotten a -0. In fact the movie gave my girlfriend a headache. As for FACEBOOK...pick up the phone and TALK to those you care about...turn of the computer! There is more to life than Facebook/Myspace/Texting...social skills are being lost. SAD!

0756404738|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear was one of the most frustrating books I've read in a long time - some of the best stuff and some of the most boring one in a package that I still do not know how to evaluate; one thing though I am very curious about is how Mr. Rothfuss will finish the story in one more book even of 1000 pages considering that he advanced Kvothe a little more than a year here and only very few of his advertised exploits in The Name of Wind have been covered.     The next book will have to be really fast moving or the series will go more books; cutting all the university stuff and maybe another 1/3 of the rest and expanding Kvothe's adventures would have made this pure awesomeness, this way it is a combination between self-indulgence of the worst sort - editors where are you when needed? - and awesomeness....
0439023513|4.0|it was a big disappointment considering the thrill of the 1st two books... although, i cant say that im not glad that i finished the series.... so it was okayyy... but not really good in comparison to the other 2...

B001TLNI08|5.0|This is a fascinating book! As an educator of more than 35 years, who hasn't done brain research but has worked with children and adults all these years, I absolutely concurred with Daniel Pink. I read the book first and then purchased this CD so I could review what I read more than a year ago and I wanted to loan it to friends who love books on CD. If you have an inkling that there is something to this idea of right brain-left brain theory----you will love this book!!! And if you are an educator, you really need to read this book.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|After YEARS of my brother nagging me to watch this flick i scored it on blu for $10....Judging by his taste i figured i'd be in for a die hard movie as those are the \\"action\\" flicks he enjoys....

This is how more movies should be made....
B00005N6KG|5.0|My wife and I use these for running. We like them better than ear buds because they are comfortable, and you can still hear some of the surrounding noise. IE they are safer than ear buds when running along side roads and crossing at intersections. Your eyes and ears work together, and if your ears don't hear a something, your eyes may not see it if you are at all distracted, etc.
B003EYVXT6|5.0|This movie is disturbing, so disturbing that it raises all kinds of issues. It is so controversial that if you are insecure about your sexuality it might make you angry.  There's sex change in this one, theirs violence and mutant lab experiments, their sex and other things with animal person. Yes, this one inspires alot of violent reactions from some people. They say the acting is poor even! but it's not , the acting is fine, well done even. It's just that they can't handle this movie. So ignore the one star reviews that harp on acting, the fact is that the acting is fine here. THe effects are great here the morality of these scientists is not so good perhaps but this is a sci fi movie so just sit back and enjoy the ride. Anyways the blu ray looks stunning and this being a modern movie should be no less than that. It's worth getting on blu ray so grab this one while you can before the angry reviews burn all the copies! after all calling this the worst movie ever is silly! They should watch the many truly bad no budget movies I have seen! that are one star affairs to most reviewers but you can't judge them on a regular scale , this one you can , it's a big budget movie and a good sci fi film that will disturb many viewers and is not suitable for kids at all.  But it is for sci fi fans like me.

1416550550|5.0|I had this book on my Kindle for months before I finally read it. I don't know why I waited so long as I absolutely loved The House at Riverton.<br /><br />Nell is a 4 year old little girl, found wandering the docks in an Australian town after being left on a ship. She can't even remember her own name, much less who she was supposed to wait for. She is taken in by Hugh and Lil and raised as their own after no one comes looking for her. But Hugh tells Nell the truth on her twenty-first birthday. Nell feels as if she has been leading a fake life and searches for her birth parents, her only memory of the ship being of a woman called The Authoress. But Nell's search is eventually put on hold as she faces a new responsibility.<br /><br />Cassie, her granddaughter, finds out Nell's secret after Nell's death and upon finding out she has inherited a property in Cornwall, England and Cassie takes up the search for the truth.<br />This book was long but beautifully told, a great Gothic tale, with plenty of mystery and intrigue. Morton leads us through this labyrinth of a story moving back and forth from the past to the present, with different points of view, through several generations without losing the reader.<br /><br />I loved the settings, I loved the characters, the mystery, and I loved the different stories that made up this amazing novel. It kept me hooked until the end. This is a must-read! Once I finally started this book, it didn't take me long to finish.<br />I am now reading Morton's newest work, The Distant Hours and so far, it doesn't fail to deliver.<br /><br />my rating 5/5
B000F9RB8K|5.0|I can say enough about the beauty, cinematography, and great family saga on screen.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
1573229725|5.0|Sue Trinder is an orphan who was raised in a den of thieves by Mrs Sucksby, a baby farmer who takes in infants and sells them. But not Sue. Sue is raised as if she were her own daughter. Peter, a man known in Mrs. Sucksby's home as \\"Gentleman\\" pays a visit with an idea for a scam. He has entrenched himself in the home of a rich man with a young, unattached niece who can not come into her inheritance until she is twenty-one or married. Gentleman proposes to instill Sue in the household as Maud's personal maid and assist him with wooing her and then running off to marry him. Once Gentleman has married Maud, he and Sue will convince doctors that she is mad and have her admitted to an asylum. Gentleman will get her money and Sue will get a large fee. Sue agrees to this but once she gets to know Maud, she falls in love with her. But she goes ahead with the plan anyway. But then- the plot twist!<br /><br />That is actually one of many plot twists. This story is told in three parts. The first narrated by Sue, the second by Maud, and then the third by Sue again.<br />I love Sarah Waters' writing and her fantastic setting of Victorian London with characters from a Dickens' novel. Evil uncles, madhouses, prisons, pickpockets,orphans, deception, betrayal: it is all in there and Waters writes about it with perfect prose.<br /><br />However, I think there was one plot twist too many that made me not enjoy this as much as I enjoyed Affinity. I'm still a bit confused as it were. Also, when we get to Maud's point of view, the story back tracks and tells the first part over but through her eyes. This was a little much though necessary. But I hate re-telling of stories. It just didn't have the smooth flow of Affinity. But it was still a worthwhile read, just not a five star read.<br />my rating 4/5

1573228737|5.0|After her father's death, Margaret Prior becomes despondent. Before he died, she was to have gone to Italy with him and her friend, Helen, with whom Margaret was in love with. Now Helen is married to Margaret's brother and their sister, Priscilla is also getting married. Her physician suggests that Margaret become a Lady Visitor at Millbank Prison, to be a comfort and example to the women. Margaret meets several of the prisoners and becomes obsessed with one, Selina Dawes, a spiritualist imprisoned for fraud.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more about the plot for fear of giving something away. But let me say that I loved this book. It takes place in Victorian London, it has a Dickensian prison and wardens. It has psychics and mediums. Margaret is a lonely character. She does not want to marry or have children. She is haunted by her love for Helen and desperately sad over the loss of her intellectual father, the only one who understood her.<br />Margaret's story alternates with that of Selina's and we see how she ended up in prison.<br /><br />Though I was not a fan of Waters' The Little Stranger which everyone else raved about, I thought Affinity was incredibly well-written, with fleshed out characters and a brilliant plot. Her descriptions of Millbank Prison, the matrons in charge of the women prisoners, and the prisoners themselves are very well researched, as are stories of the spiritualist community.<br /><br />This book is a must, must read! It is very atmospheric and Gothic-like. In case I didn't mention it, I loved it.<br /><br />my rating 5/5
B002ZG99G8|4.0|People who don't like this film say that the movie has plot holes or that it's simple.  That's sort of the point.  It's a good, old-fashioned action film.  It has good looking studs, hot women, cool weapons, a bad-ass villain and numerous explosions.  It's meant to be a ride, not an Oscar-worthy, mind-bending drama.  Enjoy it for what it is - fun.
1439152780|5.0|3 sisters live in a castle in England, where they have lived their whole lives. There is mystery, secrets, a Gothic castle, hidden passageways, murder, suicide, lost loves, dark and stormy nights, and a famous scary children's book.<br /><br />Are you hooked yet? I was.<br /><br />The Blythe sisters, twins Saffy and Percy, and the younger Juniper live in Milderhurst Castle. Edie Burchill is a young editor in London, who discovers that her mother briefly lived with the sisters Blythe, during WWII when London children were evacuated out to the country, and that the writer of her favorite childhood book, The True History of the Mud Men, the book that made Edie a bibliophile, was the father of these sisters.<br /><br />Edie becomes fascinated: why did her mother not talk about this? What secrets do the sisters hold? What happened to Juniper's lover, Thomas Cavill? Why is Juniper forever trapped in the past, waiting for her lover? Why did Percy and Saffy never marry? What horrible secret did their father tell Juniper? Does The True History of the Mud Men have it's origins in a real story?<br /><br />Morton does finally answer these questions and more, answers I mostly did not see coming. It does take 576 pages to get there, though. While I love Kate Morton's work and I loved this as well, there was a lot of back story that could have been tweaked a little. But the writing lives up to her usual standards, very atmospheric, great character development. As usual, she weaves between past and present, creating questions and building suspense. But it was well-worth the wait. This book is perfect for this time of year, with the dark coming so early, all those long hours to fill until bed, while the cold nips at your door...I'm getting carried away. But I definitely recommend this. Fans of Kate Morton won't be disappointed and this is perfect for those new to her work.<br /><br />my rating 4.5/5
B002ZG994U|4.0|This review has two parts - the film and the actual DVD product I received from Amazon.    First, the film: the characters are classic and they are true to form for the original versions put on television in the 1980s.  Sharlto Copley's performance as H.M. Murdock was particularly enjoyable.  The film has the same sense of energy and fun that the series had while upping the ante a bit with the body count.  In the original series, it was almost a point of pride that there were only 2 on-screen deaths during 5 seasons.  I guess it's a sign of the times that a modern version had to actually kill some of the bad guys.    Some people don't like the film because they say it has plot holes and doesn't follow the \\"laws of physics.\\"  Well, duh!  It's an action movie.  More than that, it's an action movie based on a cheesy action TV series from the 1980s.  That's part of the fun of the film.  You don't watch guys fall to earth in a tank because it's real - you watch them fall because it's funny as hell to see them interact.  If we watched films for \\"reality,\\" well, films would be pretty boring.  There's a reason films say \\"based\\" on true events instead of \\"here's everything exactly as it happened\\"...     I recommend the extended version of the film.  Not only does it have the 2 extra scenes with Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz that appeared at the end of the credits when the film was in theaters, but it has some other scenes that really build the team rapport.  I think it's a better version of the film.    Now, as for the actual product.  My DVD (regular disc, not BluRay) has some issues.  It skips or gets hung up on occasion, and at the same point in every viewing, the closed captioning will appear on the screen and hang two words there until I stop the DVD and start it up again.  I don't know if this is a mass production problem, but it happens no matter what player I try it in, so... I'm in the process of trying to get a new disc.

0670022411|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  Magic, Paranormalcy, Romance, Vampires, Witches, Daemons, History, Beautiful Locales & more!  It's an adult Harry Potter/Twilight.  I can hardly wait for the sequel! Thank you, Deborah, for such a captivating story!
B002MXA7TC|3.0|Sweet Disposition was the album's hit, and the reason why I bought the CD. It turns out that Sweet Disposition is the best song on the album. I expected more, since this song rocks so much. There are a couple other good songs, but overall I was disappointed by the album. I'll still pop it in the CD player now and again, but it won't stay in there for long.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|Not that there has to be a clear-cut resolution for everything, but I would have liked a bit more of the story told explicitly, especially since there are high emotional stakes for the three main characters:  Matt Damon, the reluctant psychic who can communicate with the dead; a young English boy who wants to talk to his dead twin brother; and a French woman who survives a tsunami while on vacation.      All three come together towards the end in England, yet there does not seem to be any kind of payoff overall.    Good performances, however, make it good enough to watch.
B00005QZH2|5.0|Love this cd. It always puts me in a great mood. I liked this so much I decided to get another of their cds. The other one is ok but this is by far the best of the two. You will not regret getting this.
B00006SFLV|4.0|This was a pretty good show about the emotional conflicts experienced by a group of teenagers and their family members in the 1990s.  The cast is great at conveying the confusion and angst of high schoolers, their parents' consternation, and the younger sister's forebearance.    Two quibbles:  it is very irritating to hear the word  \\"like\\" used in almost every sentence; nobody could have worn that much ugly plaid clothing.
0061537934|5.0|I read a lot of books and most of them I forget soon after I have finished them but this book I will always remember and it will find a place among the few books that I chose to keep instead of sending them on to the library.  I loved Enzo and after reading his story, I will forever look at my own canine companion in a new light.  What do you suppose she is thinking?!?!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|This album is so incredibly underrated,just because of the bad production and the trolls which rate this intentionally down.  So I had to compensate for the bad reviews.The drumming here is definitely better than the drumming of the first 5 albums.There are a lot of blast beats,too,the ones in public display of dismemberment aren't the only ones.Overall this isn't as good as the first 5 albums,but it's very close and far better than anything after seasons in the abyss.   The best song here is Beauty through order.At first it is slow ,but it gets fast and agressive at the end.(The lyrics are great as well)
B001TOD92C|5.0|This movie rocks. One of Mickey Rourke's best acting in many years. It shows us how hard a wrestler's life is when they are past thier prime,lose thier family,thier body badly beaten up and just trying to make ends meet. It's also one of the the saddest movies in years. I wish The Nostalgia Critic would have added this film to his Top 11 Saddest Moments Countdown. The rest of the cast are also good actors. It's also very bloody too like the footage of Rourke jamming his thump into the meat slicer and his fight against The Necro Butcher. The ending is confusing. I mean what the heck happened to him when he jumped off the top rope and the film fades to black? Explain movie Explain! Overall,it's great film for any wrestling fan. I give this film a 10 out of 10.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Ever since I was a child, I have been in love with the Toy Story series. We owned the laser disk for Toy Story (one) and went on to buy the two-pack DVD set when Toy Story 2 was released. As a devoted fan, I felt that I was obligated to get this movie. I was surprised by how quickly it got to my door. I ordered it one night and literally received it the next morning. :) I'm very satisfied with the product and the service.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|Simply replace almost the entirety of AFFC with the phrase \\"time passes\\". I'm disgusted with how this book was done. Worse is that Martin has locked himself into this split format for the next book.  Don't waste your time on this book. Wikipedia the plot points and pray the next book is better.
B003QCCS36|4.0|A friend gave me this c.d. as a Saint Patrick's Day present.  He said, \\"Ray LaMontaigne is an artist.\\" Later retiring to my parlor, I hit the \\"play\\" button and for a moment, I heard the Allman Brothers \\"One-Way Out\\" and \\"Southbound\\" coming at me with a smokier, different but similar voice than that of Greg Allman. NOT an artist, I do not understand why \\"Repo Man\\" was chosen to begin this beautiful album, but the song is definitely something an aged Forest Gump might appreciate after being dumped so often by his childhood hippie love.      Then came the wonderful \\"New York City's Killing Me\\" which no doubt will not be Rudy Giuliani's campaign theme song 2012, and directly afterward, Ray's pretty escape \\"God Willin & the Creek don't Rise\\" into refreshing Carolina hills.  (Off -topic, I am hopeful Steve Earle listens to LaM's \\"NYCs killing me\\" and returns to Copperhead Road)    In the album's song 3 - 6, the Pariah Dogs UNFORTUNATELY seem to take a no-flyzone backseat, but LaMontaigne's voice & lyrics charmed my earspace, until the lively twang-return in \\"Old before your time,\\" and the end \\"Devil's in the jukebox\\" I moved to turn-up the volume, and marvel at what I heard.  Not yet hitting his \\"Harvest\\" I give this work a bright 4-star light.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I discovered Mumford and Sons via 'Little Lion Man'.  A friend linked it on Facebook and I was hooked.  Beautiful lyrical music and excellent musicians with a unique blend of instruments with nothing more than a bass drum that the lead singer/guitarist stomps on.<br /><br />Great stuff, has been used in several movies/tv shows as the sad music at the end, Stargate Universe used 'Awake my Soul' when a character died at the beginning of season 2.
067182449X|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I don't know why there are negative reviews, unless they had defective items. (Understandable then of course) Some reviews said there are too many separate areas to fill with air...REALLY? It literally took me 10 minutes from opening the box and blowing the whole thing up and all the little floaty toys that come with it...with my 11 month old running around \\"helping\\" me! I have the pump of course...would never recommend getting this pool with out the pump! THIS THING ROCKS! Of course we only opening it today and I'll have to come back and review again after a few months of use - but this thing is soooo great! my son is crazy about it! I feel like it's so much toy for the money! Highly recommend. At this point, I feel like even if it did break in a few months - it's worth it to get another one! It's that fun. We have a huge regular pool in our yard but our little guy is not allowed to go near it or in it until he's completed his swim lessons. So this is an amazing way for him to enjoy the hot days and the pool atmosphere with friends and cousins - safely!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This wonderful movie came to life even more with this Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition Blu-ray.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The X41 headphones are definitely worth the investment. At first  I was a little unsure about surround sound from a headphone but after a few weeks of use now I can say, without a doubt, they are amazing. You can determine directionality from these headphone with ease. Playing games (especially FPS) with these gives you an advantage.<br /><br />These headphones work with Xbox Live flawlessly. The separate volume control for chat is extremely helpful as well.<br /><br />The only downside that I've experienced is some cracking of sounds every now and then. It seems that when the batteries are getting older the more it happens. Usually switching batteries fixes this or even just sitting a few feet closer to the receiver. This one con that I've experienced would NOT stop me from buying these again- these headphones are great!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're thinking about getting these- do it. You will be very satisfied.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/27/13<br />I have had these headphones for 2 years now. I still use them every time I play. I have resolved the cracking that I hear (it was interference with other wifi devices, baby monitor, cordless phones, etc). The sound, at two years old, is still phenomenal. The headphones are sturdy enough to last this long with some mild beatings (I have a two year old). To this day I do not regret the investment I made in these- I still recommend to anyone looking for high-quality, sturdy, surround sound headphones.
0446195529|4.0|Reading Baldacci is a bit like reading Robert Ludlum for me. The books are consistently fast paced with equal portions of character development so that I enjoy the read but can't always remember which books I've read. Having read a quarter of Baldacci's books this was particularly enjoyable with the twists and turns taken by our government agencies, scary technology, rock solid character of Oliver Stone and the return of the Camel Club. I was particularly intrigued by his evil counterpart that emerges at one point (don't want to give it away). Slightly unbelievable but that's what makes it interesting.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|After hearing a friend of mine talk about the show I borrowed the first 5 episodes from Netflix and became hooked. It was between borrowing the rest from Netflix and paying the fee or outright buying the whole season in order to catch up to the present season 2. After searching Amazon and finding it on sale for $18.99 at the time I decided to just own it. The price was amazing for such a popular show and the episodes are so entertaining myself and my father almost sat and watched this the entire weekend we received it. Great look, great quality, great price, and best of all it was bought new didn't have to buy second hand!
B004GNYGTI|5.0|Now, I am the first to admit that I am a big Jason Bourne fan. Matt delivers every single time.  But I relunctly rented Salt because I was thinking what harm could be done watching this movie on a gloomy Saturday afternoon.  Well imagine my shock when I realized anyone who wasn't working with Comrade Evelyn Salt was done serious harm.  The movie proved that SALT is a force to be reckoned with. I was on the edge of my chair from the moment Orlov was seated in the interrogation room until the very end of the movie.  I love suspense movies; and because I have seen enough of them; many are so predictable.  Well as another poster mentioned, you didn't have to know what side Salt was working for (Russia or America) to be pulled into the action and rooting for her to find her husband. It wasn't until you see her husband killed, that you realize she really loved him and her adopted country.  So except for the fact that I did sense Ted Winter might be the other assassin, especially when he was riding in the elevator with the President, that was fairly obvious.  Otherwise, I thought the movie was brilliantly directly.  Hope to see Miss Jolie in Tomb Raider next year. This actress got skills.
0670022411|2.0|What started out as a promising novel of witches, daemons and vampires turned into a feeble love story between a witch and a vampire halfway through the book.  A taboo in the \\"creature\\" world, there were too many threats and very little action. Much conversation about nothing.
0670022411|4.0|I just finished the book and enjoyed it very much.  I wish the next book was already available because I certainly would buy it.  I enjoyed the new twists on the familiar characteristics of vampires, witches, and daemons (seriously, though, what are daemons supposed to be?) The vivid descriptions of locales, food, and wine were lovely, but I agree with the opinions of some reviewers that the descriptions of alchemy texts and symbolism were a bit dry.  Hopefully, Ms. Harkness will continue to focus on the characters and not become lost in the dusty \\"mythology\\" of alchemy.  As with most books, there were a few \\"slow\\" points, but those lags were definitely offset by the more intense action sequences in the book.  Ms. Harkness has a wonderful knowledge base of historical events and people which enables her to develop a wonderful backdrop for the characters.  I do think, however, that Matthew and Diana fell in love with eachother a tad too early in the book, but I did appreciate the deepening of their feelings as their story unfolds.  I really enjoyed the many quirky, interesting, and even creepy characters in the book.  Ms. Harkness certainly is a smart, creative writer with a wonderful future ahead of her.  She found a fan in me!
B00000J048|1.0|I bought this for my 4 yr old grandson and I am very, very disappointed in this item.  The parts are very difficult for an adult to assemble and virtually impossible for a child to enjoy alone.  The box did not contain any instructions to help in the management of the activity.  By the time an adult gets any of the parts together so the child can see the gears interact, any child will have lost interest.
0143038095|3.0|Very engaging and dwells on your mind even after you have finished that last page.   It straddles between rustic and conservative China in the 20th century where the mothers grew up and how they passed their life experiences and wisdom to their daughters in modern day California.
0545123275|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Shiver. The story has a very sweet romance between the two main characters, Grace and Sam, and moves along at a good pace (it doesn't drag but it's not fast-paced either). It was an enjoyable read, and I flew through it in a few days.      The writing was very beautiful, and done in a romantic style that fit the book perfectly. It was descriptive in a way that moved the story along but didn't drag it down. The story is told in first-person narrative, switching back and forth between Grace and Sam's point of view. However, one of the problems I had with this book was that I felt that these character's voices were not developed enough. A few times I would be reading and forget whose point of view it was, Sam's or Grace's, because both character's voices sounded the same to me.       In the book the werewolves transformation is caused by cold weather, which is a unique take on it but never really made sense to me. But I went with it anyway. For a good part of the book I wondered \\"Why don't they just move somewhere hot if the cold makes them change?\\" Grace, who is supposed to be a very smart straight A student never asks Sam about this, (which to me would have been a blaringly obvious question), when she talks to him about a cure. This issue isn't addressed until much later in the book, when another character finally asks Sam about it. He says that some of the wolves had tried it before but it hadn't worked; they had only become very sensitive to subtle temperature changes. This didn't make much sense to me either. But the thing that I really didn't understand, was the theory Grace came up with for a 'cure'--that inducing a fever while in human form would kill the wolf inside.       I went with all of this anyways because I liked the characters and I was enjoying the story, but this is why I can only give this book 4 stars. In my opinion the plot needed a clearer sense of direction, and all of the werewolf transformation/cure stuff (which is really the backbone of the whole story) should have been better explained or the theories better developed and strengthened so that they were more solid.       Despite the flaws I still very much enjoyed Shiver, and I would recommend it to others. I eagerly started Linger the moment I finished Shiver, and I'm already anticipating the third book, Forever, due out in July. With its likeable characters, sweet romance, and deliciously beautiful writing, Shiver is definitely a book worth reading.
030745455X|4.0|Here is a sequel that doesn't suffer in the least from being one.

Waiting to finish the trilogy.<br />I lament the fact that there can be no more to read after this.
B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Vogue's September Issue is the most important issue of the year. Anna Wintour may have inspired the Devil Wears Prada character Miranda Priestly (played deliciously by the phenomenal Meryl Streep in an Oscar nominated performance) but she's not the devil. In fact, she's quite a modern day example of what a woman should be aiming for not only successful in professional but personal as well. We know Anna is a divorced mother and we meet her daughter, Bee Shaffer, in the documentary. While Anna makes the final decision and her influence is powerful juggernaut in the industry, she maintains a shyness, a need for perfection, a coolness, and style to be envied and imitated by others.    Anna lives quite well between her New York City townhouse and her Long Island country home. The documentary talks about the making of the September Issue months in advance and the process. Anna's not alone in this endeavor of running fashion's top magazine. Anna's sunglassed face is usually spotted at the must see fashion shows.    Anna's team includes the wonderful Grace Coddington who has heart and soul that comes through in this documentary. As the fashion creative editor, Grace is passionate about her work even disagreeing with Anna at times. Despite their bickering, they mutually respect and understand each other in this all-consuming career. Both Anna and Grace came to Vogue in the 1960s and have stayed. Grace's story was more interesting to me about how she came from North Wales, her modeling days, and a tragic car accident. Even though she had plastic surgery from the accident, she returned to Vogue. Anna and Grace have Vogue in their blood.    Then there is Andre Leon Talley, a flamboyant editor at large, who has been with Anna and Grace for years at Vogue. Andre is often seen around New York City and even in reality shows like \\"Kell on Earth\\" and Tyra Banks' \\"America's Next Top Model.\\" He works day and night but not at the office rather on the road in New York City from designerto designer.    Anna, Andre, and Grace are only three of the editors at Vogue to mention here in this documentary. Each of them are worthy of a documentary. They work as a team and are often seen at the fashion shows beside the runway.    When Anna recommends a fashion designer to a major fashion house, it's a huge honor and blessing. She becomes Mother Anna. Her influence isn't just to the magazine but to help aspiring fashion designers get opportunities otherwise not afford them.    The documentary fails to have a French subtitles on them but I'm not complaining that much. My only problem was that it was too short in my opinion. I think they could have done 2 hours easily. The extras were fine.    I hope that Grace Coddington's name is on the Queen's Honours List for her services to the Fashion Industry. She deserves the same recognition as Anna does. The two women make an excellent team with Andre. It's amazing to see strong, independent, intelligent women like Anna and Grace to be friends without animosity like in reality shows. They are friends, colleagues, and fashion icons. It's not just Anna's show. She couldn't do Vogue without Grace's genius and Andre's outgoing nature.
1416562605|3.0|This book is real, intense and carries a social message delivered in a very subtle form..you have to think about it a little to realize it..it comes in parts overridden by the character's desires/ambitions. I didn't find it funny but it was intelligently written.

0385533829|3.0|read his other books years ago in the standard paperback versions before they were turned into movies.  part of the char<br /> is using your imagination. with the illustrated version i find that my imagination is shut down because nothing is left for me to figure out. and i hear tom hanks' voice instead of what my imagination proposes. also, brown has become formulaic. same story, different city.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Movies, like The Goonies, I think should be seen as a kid.  Another good example would be The Princess Bride.  I am not sure why I feel that way.  The Goonies is a great blend of action, adventure, comedy, romance, swashbuckling, and sprinkled on top is a some great 80's music.  I mentioned seeing this type of movie as a kid because I just do not think an adult could enjoy it as much unless they had the experience of watching it as a kid.  Brings you back to your childhood I guess is a good way to put it.
193413712X|1.0|Knowing that this was a Pulitzer Prize winner, and that it was a short book, our book club was looking forward to reading it and discussiong it.  Our club has been meeting for almost a decade, has twelve members, about half male and half female, all middle-aged or so, and all avid readers.    Typically, we do not all agree on our opinions, but in this case we were unanimous.  Using the Amazon ratings, we all rated it one star.  There were moments of startlingly brilliant prose, and many pages of turgid slop.  No plot to speak of, no character development, no sense of time or place, and felt like it had been re-worked and re-re-worked way too much.  The plot seemed to have been concocted using a Mixmaster.  Jerky, discontinuous, and confusing.  It was theoretically about George, but mostly about Howard (go figure).      How (and why) the Pulitzer jurors nominated this first work was impossible to discren.  How (and why) the Pulitzer Board selected this piece as the best fiction of 2009 is utterly incomprehensible.
1400052173|5.0|Excellent book.  Well written but disturbing.  Fortunately we have progressed somewhat in our thinking and practices but there is a great deal more to be done.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|[[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]]    They had a great series (Firefly) which the rising cult following shows how big of a mistake  they made by canceling it. After much screaming, they made this movie which shows that the cast  was still rising to better things. Didn't anyone learn anything from Star Trek??? This is a   franchise that has still to take flight. Maybe they need to throw the studio executives overboard  and go independent. Let me put it in plain language -We want more!!!

B00005N6KG|4.0|The headset was purchased to replace a headset for a a dictation machine.  It works great.  I had to turn the volume down on the machine because the sound was so much better than the old headset.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|As with \\"Reveal,\\" \\"Around the Sun,\\" and \\"Accelerate,\\" I approached the release of \\"Collapse Into Now\\" with apprehension, doubt, and a sliver of hope. Hope that this would be the record I would enjoy from start to finish. Hope that this record would sound like the R.E.M. I knew from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Hope that this would be an album I'd still be enthusiastic about after a few listens and a few weeks or even months.    When I first heard \\"Discoverer\\" a few months ago, I prepared myself for disappointment. However, for me the album as a whole works better than any of R.E.M.'s efforts since \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi.\\" \\"Up\\" and \\"Reveal\\" seemed like experimental efforts by the \\"three-legged dog\\" version of R.E.M. To my ears those records seem like the work of a band trying to discover its identity and dealing with the emotional aftermath from losing integral fourth member, Bill Berry, who retired. There's good music on both records, but, as a long-time fan, I'm not big on R.E.M. songs without guitars and drums. I don't know what \\"Around the Sun\\" was other than a cud that served as a wake-up call to the bandmembers. There are a couple of good songs on that record, but for the most part it's forgettable. I don't think I've ever been as doubtful about the band as I was after that effort. I almost gave up on them.    With \\"Accelerate\\" came promises of a \\"return to form.\\" I refused to buy into the hype until I spent some quality time with the record. Though it \\"rocked\\" and included more guitar and drums, I got bored with it quickly. The rockers seemed nearly identical, the lyrics were awful, and the whole thing seemed like the work of a band that was trying to hard. I probably haven't listened to \\"Accelerate\\" in its entirety in a year and a half. So when I heard similar \\"return to form\\" assurances in advance of \\"Collapse Into Now,\\" I refused to get excited.     Then I heard the entire record and fell in love. Even \\"Discoverer,\\" as the lead track, grew on mequickly. Think of all the things that make R.E.M. what it is - jangly guitars, beautiful Stipe/Mills harmonies, mandolin, lush ballads, guitar-driven rockers, silly punk/pop songs dripping with attitude and lyrics bordering on jibberish, and spoken word stream of consciousness poetry. Several guest appearances - though subdued - add to the songs. Peaches really makes \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter,\\" reminding the listener of Kate Pierson on \\"Shiny Happy People\\" and \\"Me in Honey.\\"     I've read a few reviews accusing R.E.M. of sounding too much like R.E.M. on this record. I wonder how many of those critics bashed R.E.M. for not sounding like R.E.M. on \\"Up,\\" \\"Reveal,\\" and \\"Around the Sun.\\" I've been waiting since 1996 for another R.E.M. record on which R.E.M. sounds like R.E.M. When a band's back catalog is as strong as R.E.M.'s, I see no sin in borrowing some of the highlights from its own history in creating new music. For a band, after 30 years and 15 records, to make a record this consistently good is something for which Messrs. Stipe, Buck, and Mills should be proud.       If you enjoyed \\"Green,\\" \\"Out of Time,\\" \\"Automatic for the People,\\" \\"Monster,\\" or \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi,\\" then there's something for you on this album.    Favorite tracks: \\"Discoverer,\\" \\"Uberlin,\\" \\"It Happened Today,\\" \\"Walk It Back,\\" \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter,\\" & \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I.\\"
B004B8DH98|2.0|Very slow.  We almost turned it off in mid movie but hoped it would take a turn for the better; but found out we should have followed our first inclination and turned it off without further wasting our time.  Beyond being a depressing film, some sections are subtitled (poorly).  Half the time the subtitles were up, we couldn't read them because they were very small, white letters against a light colored background.  You can get the gist of what they say but it is irritating nonetheless.  I feel like I need to watch another movie just to lift my spirits.

I read \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" and while an engrossing read, the ending left me flat...I had figured it out in the begining and kept thinking there had to be something more. Anyway, that was not the case in the Distant Hours. I found myself second guessing myself throughout and then being genuinely surprised with it's ending. A wonderful book. Perfect for stormy nights or clear spring days. If you like gothic novels with large estates, captivating scenery and an intricate mystery, you'll love The Distant Hours.
B003L77GVK|5.0|There's not a lot I can add to the two other most recent reviews. SGU has been excellent from the beginning. From Season 2.5, the episodes \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Twin Destinies\\" (all that's been aired as I write) - those two alone have raised the bar again for sci-fi programs. SGU has demonstrated consistently that sci-fi and superb mainstream drama can, in fact, coexist to the point where they really can't be separated. If every two episodes were consolidated into one feature-length film, I'd gladly pay the admission fee at a movie theater. (What better place to get the full effect?)<br /><br />While it's outrageous that this fine programming will be off the air after eight more episodes, I feel about that the same way I still think of Firefly: I'm sad about both series coming to a premature end, but I'm incredibly glad that they were made, and aired for any time at all. -- SGU has caused me to grow both as a \\"What if...?\\" intellectually curious fan, and emotionally as well: the main characters at this point have all been superbly filled out by a fantastic team of writers, and wonderfully realized through excellent acting and direction. Nor have the technical aspects been neglected, as the consistently top-notch VFX, photography, and musical scoring have amply demonstrated.<br /><br />All those superlatives have been well-earned. While SGU is definitely more grown-up than the previous two Stargate series (as already stated by a previous reviewer), still, I find that watching it renews the child-like sense of wonder and amazement that so many of us strive to keep going within ourselves.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Cinematic perfection! No doubt a great movie with more imagination than just about anything you will see.

0312600844|4.0|This is a story about family - about the presence and absence of relationships (both functional and dysfunctional) - set in modern America, and told from a number of different perspectives.  The novel opens with an historic view of the Berglund family seen from the perspective of their neighbours in St Paul, Minnesota. The Berglunds (husband Walter, wife Patty, and children Jessica and Joey), are a liberal middle-class family who were part of the gentrification of urban St Paul.  Patty was a homemaker, and an ideal neighbour, Walter was an environmentally conscious lawyer.  On the face of it, an ideal family but a closer look at the Berglund's lives reveals that all is not as it seems.  Patty's much loved son Joey becomes involved with a neighbour's daughter, Connie, and moves in with Connie and her mother.  Why has this happened? Who are the Berglunds, really, and where do they come from and what do they stand for? What are they seeking?  Why do the family relocate to Washington DC, and leave the home that they have worked on for years?<br /><br />`Then again, there had always been something not quite right about the Berglunds.'<br /><br />The next part of the story is an unpublished autobiography composed by Patty Berglund at the suggestion of her therapist.  In this, we learn of Patty's youth as a star basketball player and of events in her past.  Of how she meets an attractive musician named Richard Katz, and his room-mate Walter Berglund, and of the events that follow in her life.<br />The novel then moves to New York in 2004 and is seen through the rotating third-person perspectives of Richard, Joey and Walter. Their overlapping narratives take us through much of the novel, until an addendum to Patty's autobiography brings us to 2010 and almost to the end of the story.<br /><br />The structure of the novel works well to convey the themes of the novel, but summarising the story in more detail would diminish the impact of reading it.  An element of surprise is needed in order to appreciate the story as it unfolds. Experiencing some of the same scenes form different perspectives enables us to see varying levels of significance, especially where one character's story is interrupted at a critical point, and another character's story begins.<br /><br />And the characters?  While the major characters are well-defined and generally consistent with the stereotypes they represent (I especially enjoyed Joey) I found Patty, frustrating and not particularly likeable or interesting. And because so much of the book is about Patty, this impacted on my overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I admired the writing in this novel.  I appreciated the focus on both the way in which the nature of American society is evolving, as well as the way in which changing (self-perpetuating but frequently circular) relationships in families define relative constructs of freedom.  But the major theme is about freedom: how do we define it, and how will we recognise it?  Is it tangible or intangible; relative or absolute; singular or collective?  What is freedom, if we don't (or can't) use it? What is the purpose of being free if we can't enjoy it?<br /><br />It's possible to just read and enjoy this book, but there's plenty of food for further thought for those so inclined.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithe the story as it unfolds.

But the major theme is about freedom: how do we define it, and how will we recognise it?  Is it tangible or intangible; relative or absolute; singular or collective?  What is freedom, if we don't (or can't) use it? What is the purpose of being free if we can't enjoy it?      It's possible to just read and enjoy this book, but there's plenty of food for further thought for those so inclined.    Jennifer Cameron-Smith

I'm still not sure this isn't a little too restrictive for me, I haven't tried it yet.

0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo started out so slow and boring I caught myself daydreaming while I was skimming the pages. I had to go back and re-read what I missed. I almost gave up on the book several times but because of all the hype I pushed through it. Boy was I rewarded! Although it may drag at times throughout the book, this book will keep you at the edge of your seat not wanting to put it down. I will continue the series and am really looking forward to it!!
B002436WJE|4.0|Fueled by Pierre Morel's vigorous direction, Liam Neeson is the whole show in a preposterously entertaining action-thriller. \\"Taken\\" (2008) starts slowly, but once the kidnapped-daughter plot takes over, it's full speed ahead with plenty of gunplay and fisticuffs along the way. Neeson acquits himself impressively as a no-nonsense action hero. The unrated director's cut remains preferable to the studio-imposed PG-13 edit. Produced and co-written by Luc Besson, who will reunite with Neeson for more bone-crunching mayhem.
B004IOP18A|5.0|This review is for the limited to 1000 180G vinyl version released in March 2011.    I recently got into spinning vinyl at home.  I enjoy it very much.  This album has been played in full twice now and it sounds great.  It is my first 180G record and it really does sound better than the other records I own, though I can't really comment on the difference between 180G and 120 for this same record.   The record I got seemed to be very good in quality.  I noticed no popping or crackle throughout the entire album.      On the music itself:  If you have never heard of The Black Keys this is a good start, and or any other album by them.   Its rock, its jazz its soul its everything all balled up into one.  The way Dan plays the guitar reminds me so much of so many people, not the least of which is Jimmy Page.  Its not studio sounding at all.  Its just good music.

B0000069CT|5.0|I concur with the other reviews in general.  I would like to add a couple of comments.    1.  The 1st Concerto is justly famous and every violinist seems to record it.    2.  The 2nd Concerto has been recorded by Heifetz and Menuhin, among others, but it is not such a strong work.      3.  The Concerto No. 3 shocked me when I first heard this recording on LP when it came out around 1980.  I am a violinist and pretty familiar with the standard repertoire, and I was startled that such a fine work was played by nobody.   Accardo's recording was the first.      The first movement is heroic, if a bit bombastic in places.  The Adagio second movement is lovely, noble and romantic.  The soloist leads with an introduction before the orchestra announces the main theme, which the soloist elaborates on. The soft horn calls near the end of the movement are something to hear.  The finale is a lively tarantella that is, to me, more exciting and more interesting than the finale of the Concerto No. 1.      4. One reviewer mentioned that the violin sounds better than in Accardo's other records.  That's true, for two reasons.  First, the recording engineers outdid themselves on this set.  The sound is rich, well balanced and has a beautiful sheen to it.  The other reason is the violin.  Accardo owned a 1733 Guarneri del Gesù violin for a while  (he has owned several Stradivaris).  The LP album covers of these recordings show him holding the Guarneri.  From the timbre it certainly sounds like he was using it for this set.  Anyway, it sounds extraordinary on these recordings--rich, brilliant and bit husky on a few low notes.  You won't find many recordings of solo violin music that will match this for beauty of sound.
B000QGEB12|5.0|Just as Blazing Saddles was a parody of every western ever made, so is Hustle a parody of every martial arts film ever made.  It's brilliantly done and very witty.  I love the deadpan humor and snappy one-liners.  This movie exceeded my expectations.  I've watched it several times and each viewing reveals another hidden jewel: a subtle joke, double entendre, or a line from some classic film.  And the film isn't just all axe-kicking; there is a good story line, at times exhilarating, hilarious, thoughtful and  poignant.
B004A8ZX14|5.0|Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are completely adorable in this movie. I would watch it over and over again.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  Very cute movie with this situation of 'no strings attached' theory.  I highly recommend for a girls night out movie!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|James cameron tried to be preachy as well as give us a kick ass movie and it just didn't mesh well.<br /><br />There is no mistaking what this movie is really about. In our own past The Native Americans were done some of the same way as reflected in this movie and it seemed like the message was one of, we must remember the past or we are doomed to repeat it...type of thing. Also it seemed to be preaching how we are destroying our environment like the non-natives did in the movie.<br /><br />While the visual effects were pretty cool, were they astonishing, wonderous, stellar or worth in excess of 300 million dollars? No, in my opinon they were not.<br /><br />When I watch a movie I don't want to be preached at so loudly by the storyline that I have a headache after watching it. If I want to be preached at, I'll go to church where I didn't pluck down $10.00 for a movie ticket.<br /><br />I don't like being lied to or having a preachy message shoved down my throat while I'm not looking. I have been told that people like their movies to have a message, that most movies have a message. Really? Did Nightmare on Elm Street have a message? If so I missed it. I thought we liked to sit down to watch a movie purely for fun, or to escape our own lives for 2 hours. Am I wrong?<br /><br />I can't be the only one who watched the movie and was irritated by the preachy, I'm gonna shove this message down yourt throat whether you like it or not, tactics. They are right there for everyone to see.<br /><br />The plot as I see it: Humans find an alien planet that has a mineral they need and a large deposit of the mineral in under a huge tree the aliens call home and they won't let the humans get near it. The humans send in a few people using a remote controlled alien body (The Avatar) which they use to get to know the aliens. One of the men using an Avatar see's that what his people are doing is wrong and decides to fight his people and side with the aliens and falls in love in the process.<br /><br />The message being: People colonizing America found Native Americans and after a while of getting to know them wanted their land and so they pushed them out and took what they wanted, killing many in the process. Now if we don't stop raping the earth our resources are going to be gone and we are going to regret what we have done.<br /><br />But I've come to the conclusion that this is what James Cameron does, he makes preachy movies. So the next time I see James cameron's name on a movie, I think I'll just give it a pass.ng America found Native Americans and after a while of getting to know them wanted their land and so they pushed them out and took what they wanted, killing many in the process.

B004529NLG|5.0|I got this movie together with a new 3DTV I bought.  I got it thinking that will be cool to watch dances in 3D and I was completely right.  After watching this movie in 3D I was amazed.  I think this movie is perfect to show the 3D capabilities to people that haven't seen the 3D in action.  I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to enjoy the 3D feature and have a real and fantastic 3D experience.<br /><br />Finally, Step up 3D went beyond my expectations for as a 3D movie.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|This album feels like a mix-tape of really good bands.  One song has me comparing them to Passion Pit or Temper Trap, but then the next song has me thinking M83.  Then another suggests Stars, and then another suggests Radiohead.  In this case, I really like the range.  High energy stuff.  Fun album.
1847879071|5.0|There are many, many books out there about statistics. Some are based more on the mathematics of statistics and some are based more on applied methods; this book strikes a perfect balance. Andy Field does an excellent job presenting what is often a difficult topic for students to grasp. Topics are presented in a systematic manner with practical examples and applications that one can test using SPSS. If you need a good balance between understanding mathematical principles and applied methods, this text is for you. It is especially helpful to nursing students doing graduate or doctoral level work. Andy Field has a unique teaching ability, which he nicely conveys through this colorful and useful text! Anyone who needs to learn statistics and SPSS (basic through advanced topics) will benefit from this book.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is an amazing visual spectacle. Christina is one of the best singers and dancers I've ever seen and her acting isn't bad either. What a voice!!! The production numbers are absolutely flawless and dazzling. This would make a GREAT Broadway show! Cher was absolutely FANTASTIC. I loved the old fashioned songs and costumes. It also  seemed that the backup dancers worked together without jealously. Burlesque is a work of art and I adored it!!!

Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I had been wanting to try this workout for some time.  I've never seen Biggest Loser, but had heard about Jillian Michaels and how intense her workouts can be.  Looking to improve the shape I was in, I ordered this DVD hoping to be able to stay motivated to complete the 30-day, 20-minute workout challenge.  Unfortunately, since I've purchased it, I had gotten sick and had been unable to go past day 8.  However, I will say I definitely started to notice a difference in endurance and could see that this workout would improve muscle tone over time.  I made it to level 2 before I needed to take a break.  I've since started up again and am on day 5 - hoping to move up to level 2 again in the next day or so.  I am motivated by the concept of a 30-day challenge and love that it can be done in 20 minutes - hard to make excuses and generally, by the time I am wishing for a workout to be over, this one is.  I look forward to completing it and would definitely consider purchasing some of her other DVDs.
1401309666|4.0|When I started reading The Long Tail by Chris Anderson, I did not fully understand the concept of the book.  The cover reads, \\"The Long Tail - Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More\\".  Call me simple-minded, but I did not truly comprehend the point he was trying to make in that statement alone.  However after reading the book, it all makes perfect sense!     In this book, Anderson explores the evolution of a new kind of economics, where people have unlimited choices as production and distribution costs have decreased drastically because of the internet and related technologies.  He discusses the historical models and practices, and then walks us through to the creation of new types of markets that we see today.  In the past, companies, marketers and advertisers were looking for the biggest \\"hits\\", the product or service that would appeal to the masses, and therefore, would great the most revenue and be the most profitable.  This model was based on the concept that there was limited \\"shelf\\" space and there were costs associated with carrying such items. In order to maximize profits, they sought to appeal to the masses.  This was exemplified in radio, tv, grocery stores, retailers, etc.  However, that principle focused only on the \\"head\\" of the curve (those that were perceived to be the biggest hits).  As you look further down the curve, the demand for more products tapers off, but in fact, never gets to zero! This is what is known as the Long Tail.  Essentially, there is some kind of demand for all products/services, no matter how niche and obscure they may seem.  The true shape is revealed when customers have infinite options.  As Anderson describes, the twentieth century was focused on the hits and in the twenty-first century, we are now focused on the niches.  He found that between a quarter and half of total revenues were from products that were not offered in the traditional brick-and-mortar store.  Information aggregators such as Google, Ebay and Amazon have played (and continue to play) a huge part in this revolution, and have made it possibly to find almost anything under the sun.     This has had major implications on our society, on the whole.  We now are accustomed to being able to find anything we want, whenever we want it.  We have hundreds of television stations, as compared to a few that were offered a few decades ago.  We have satellite radio. We have the internet, YouTube and millions of online sites that have \\"fragmented\\" our attention.  He also discusses that controversial idea of whether or not we, as consumers, do well with unlimited choices.  Anderson argues that consumers enjoy choices when they are able to seek out help about what to buy, look at recommendations, and have access to additional information.  In the online world, filters help us parse through the wanted and the unwanted, the relevant and the irrelevant, according to our individual wants and needs.     I thoroughly enjoyed this book and learning about his view of the Long Tail.  I like that his thoughts and theories were well supported and documented via years of research with executives and industry insiders.  It was great that he was given proprietary data from many of these cooperative companies to support this project. I would like to continue to read more from Anderson, and will seek out additional books and Wired articles he has authored.
B000002GYW|5.0|The one reviewer was right it is their best album by far.I like the early eagles up to 1976  never cared for joe walsh in the group.'Desperado' and 'one of these nights' were the albums the eagles really had something to say.After that it was all about money!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|This is an okay movie.  The prime minister has a relationship with the girl who brings the tea and she is 15 years younger than him (reminiscient of President Clinton who was 26 years older than Monica Lewinsky).  There are some good moments and a few funny ones. I get the impression that public performances of the nativity are more acceptable in England as compared to here. The film features a lot of famous British actors: Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Alan Rickman, and Kris Marshall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Reading this series made me want to go back to the history books and read about how Rome rose and fell.  I for one am glad that it wasn't all tied up in a nice package with a pretty bow. My personal experience is that the people close to me who went off to the various wars of the past years did not, if they survived, come back the same as when they left.  And only one in a million goes on to be elected President (for eg., Eisenhower). The others just found a way to make a life and cope with the rest of us who were spared the experience. I thought that this book did a fine job of telling that tale.  Though billed as a series for 7th grade and up, I think this is a read for all ages. If you are accustomed to reading more complicated prose and plots, you might find it reads faster than usual, but no problem - go back and re-read certain chapters (as I did) and you'll discover new things.  Since the book is entirely told in the first person (Katniss), the reader will inevitably learn more about her thought processes and sides of dark and light than any other character's. The other characters will be drawn with her hand as well. The fact that there is such vigorous debate about her character's actions and the direction of the plot tells me at least that the author is very gifted. Even when she's unlikable, the reader can identify with Katniss deeply enough to start thinking they know what she should have done differently and begin trying to boss her around!!!
B00007GZQZ|2.0|This is a moderate movie co-produced by Steven Spielberg. I'm surprised the house hadn't been destroyed already if it was so weak. Some of the people brought in to do maintenance were charging excessively high prices.  It really sucked when Walter (Tom Hanks) managed to knock over the scaffolding while the construction crew was trying to rebuild the house. Why was the couple pretending to be married when they weren't? In the end, Walter's dad buys a house in Brazil from the same con artist who sold to Walter.

B00003CXFV|4.0|This was a solid movie. It is sad that there are single mothers who are trying to balance work with caring for their children. At least Erin had some help from the neighbor. Unfortunately her job didn't allow her to be with her children for very much over about a year's time.<br /><br />It is good that there are people who try to prevent companies from poisoning our water, but there is speculation that the chemicals put into the water by Pacific Gas & Electric were not harmful enough to cause cancers and other health problems.
0439023483|5.0|This book was one of the first ones in a long time that I could not put down!  As soon as I started reading I had to devour every word as soon as I could!  I haven't felt this way about a book series since Harry Potter.  The writing style of Suzanne Collins is very easy to follow, yet she puts in the right amount of details for me.  Closing your eyes, you could see the people and action that was taking place.  But, alas, you have to open you eyes to be able to finish!<br /><br />At certain points of the book I could feel my heart beating, actually scared for the characters.  I laughed, I cried, I hungered for more after the first book of the series was over.  I NEEDED to know how it ended.  I felt tense for the next two days until the next in the series arrived.  I have loaned out my copy to 5 people, all ages, that have loved it just as much as me.  This book will be loved by everyone from 13 to 100!<br /><br />Love!!
6304711905|5.0|I am not normally a fan of westerns, but in my opinion, this is the best one ever made. I can watch this over and over and never get tired of it. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor that year and it is a shame he did not win. Great movie, great cast, great score....enough said.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie is great entertainment for the whole family. My husband and I busted up over Will Ferrell's one liners and our 9 year old got quite the kick out of it as well. We watched it 3 times in 2 days and will most likely be adding it to our permanent collection.
0307595579|1.0|Because of all the reviews I bought the hardcover trilogy for my 18 yr old daughter.  She suffered up until page 107 when she finally gave up.  I only made it up until page 55 before I gave up.  What are we missing?  It doesn't make any sense.  We were looking forward to a great escape and are very disappointed.  Reading this first book is not enjoyable or entertaining.<br />I want you to see what I mean so here's a paragraph on page 53:<br />  Blomkvist had never heard of Lisbeth Salander and was happily innocent of her report delivered earlier that day, but had he listened to it he would have nodded in agreement when she spoke of his loathing for bean counters, saying that it was not a manifestation of his left-wing political radicalism.  Mikael was not interested in politics, but he was extremely sceptical of political \\"isms\\".  He had voted only once in a parliamentary election-in 1982-and then he had hesitantly plumped for the Social Democrats, there being nothing in his imagination worse than three years more with Gosta Bohman as finance minister and Thorbjorn Falldin (or possibly Ola Ullsten) as prime minister.  So he had voted for Olof Palme, and got instead the assassination of his prime minister plus the Bofors scandal and Ebbe Carlsson.<br />The whole book is like that.  It makes no sense.  I struggled and I suffered and now I've given up.

0399250395|1.0|With \\"a Very Hungry Caterpillar\\", I was expecting something alot more grand given all the raving reviews and positive aggregate.   What I got instead was a book that failed to satisfy any of the senses or tastes of the refined individual.  The plot was much too simplistic, and offered nothing to those looking forward to a daring plot on metamorphic themes and evolution between various stages of life. instead, the writing style was atrocious, most likely to appeal to a sophomoric audience, and the novel began as soon as it ended.    As far as the illustrations, they seem to be little more than paper mache and have no real skill or artistic merit. I have seen better drawings from a child, and drawings that carried more of a better synthesis between plot and picture.     If you are a more mature reader and are actually looking for a decent work of fiction, I highly recommend Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis.
B003LXSY60|1.0|One word: Garbage. There is nothing original, technically impresive, or desirable about these guys in any way. Why are people lauding them? So many bands out there are redifining music daily and we award these goofs for re-hashing a simple form. Crap. There are so many curtains of safety to hide behind on this album. So lets inspire our young ones to reach for the stars by digging through the trash for an old, rotten dirty diaper and framing it for dumb-mass consumption.
B004J713JW|5.0|Oh man. I was so pumped when I saw this at Best Buy for $20. I couldn't believe it. I snapped it up immediately and watched it with my dad right when we got home. Other than the small disappointment of not having \\"Uptown Girl\\" or \\"Big Shot\\" on there, it was freaking awesome. The mixing is pretty tight with the exception of Joel's mix being a bit too loud sometimes, or like on \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" where the backup singers' mix was a bit too light. But overall, it was beautiful.     Highlight: 57,000 people singing the lyrics to \\"Piano Man\\". Wow. Mind blowing.    Also, Roger Daltrey, Paul McCartney, Steven Tyler, John Mellencamp, and Tony Bennett show up. Holy crap. My mind exploded.     Definitely buy this. Billy Joel plays with such enthusiasm and his band is absolutely amazing. Modern musicians can't hold a candle to these guys when it comes to live music. No autotune here, baby.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|I discovered AWOLNATION purely by accident a few months ago and downloaded the EP, Back From Earth, straight away. It blew my mind. It was the first album I had downloaded in ages that I could listen to again and again without stopping. This album is simply amazing. AWOLNATION has to be one of the most creative artists that I've discovered in years. The songs aren't necessarily complex. They certainly won't compete with Beethoven, Stravinsky, or Coltrane in that sense, but the songs have a way of capturing your attention unlike most music today.     There's really something here for just about anyone; it defies genre. What drew me in was the classic soul/funk influence you hear in a lot of the songs. You can't help but tap your foot to a song like Guilty Filthy Soul!
B003EYVXUU|3.0|I remember I was very excited to see that there was an American version of \\"Let The Right One In\\" being made and thought that the casting of Chloe Grace Moretz in the role of the young vampire was perfect. But having seen the original and liked it very much, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with the remake. Specifically, I was unable to connect with the character of Owen, the young boy, as I did with Oskar in the original. I think this is because a better job was done in the original on establishing Oskar's lonliness and insecurity. So in turn we're more able to relate to his connection with the child-vampire. Also, I think the New Mexico setting did not lend to the feeling of desolation that adds so much to the \\"feel\\" of the original (set in rural Sweden).    Admittedly, I'm comparing this with the original and that may not be fair. So I'll say, as a stand alone vampire flick, \\"Let Me In\\" is a slick production that is well-paced and entertaining. Chloe Grace Moretz indeed does an excellent job as the young vampire but there's no real connection with the other characters or their situations for me and as a result I think this is a decent remake but does not come up to the level of film-making of the original.
0738711500|3.0|After reading some rave reviews about this deck, I decided to give it a try.  The book by Ellershaw is clear and to the point.  It would be a good first book by beginners to get introduced to the tarot.  The book is illustrated with and discusses the Gilded Tarot deck.  Now, deck choices are very personal and purely a matter of taste.  This deck simply did not appeal to me.  I found the colors to be too bright and the images too gaudy.  I much prefer the subtlety of the Pamela Colman Smith images and the complexity and beauty of the Thoth deck.  In addition, the artist seems to have stripped the Rider-Waite cards of essential details while adding extraneous tidbits which seem to be there for the sake of being cute.  For example, there are lots of cute fuzzy little animals running around on these cards but the Queen of Wands has lost her cat!  The King of Cups has the planet Saturn dangling over his head, which is odd because Saturn is the least watery and emotionally coldest planet in astrology whereas Cups are supposed to represent love, feeling, and emotion. It creates the impression that the artist has just thrown symbols in for appearance sake without regard to their cultural significance or their typical meanings in the tarot.  As a result, I find these cards confusing and cannot connect with them in a reading.  In summary, I liked the book but found the deck wanting.  On the other hand, these cards clearly appeal to many readers, so if they \\"grab\\" you emotionally and you are able to find meaning in the images, by all means use them.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is an awesome movie, unstoppable action and true to form on terms and processes in a rail yard. From start to finish, you will be on the edge of your seat.  There are very few movies that I will watch repeatedly, but this is one that I will continue to watch more than once.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|In my opinion, the first Paranormal Activity is one the 5 best horror movies ever (yes, that's right--ever!). I watched it with my girlfriend who was not nearly as freaked out as I was. When I went home the next night and went to bed, I locked my bedroom door!! That's how freaked out I was. So I was VERY interested in the sequel even though, I know, the sequels are rarely as good as the first. This is the case with PA 2. The only time I jumped was when Kristi was in the kitchen and all the cupboard doors opened up. It was interesting to see doors move, shadows, the baby's mobile move, etc. but otherwise this wasn't very scary and very disappointing. Please, don't make PA 3!! I'd recommend it to fans of the first, but don't expect much.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Just darn funny, is all. Great plot, lots of zombies, hilarious from beginning to end. I really like the lead dude. He is very good in everything I have seen him in. Now, if you are looking for a scary zombie movie, this is not it. There are scary and tense moments but for the most part, it is a hilarious romp. Quirky and funny, good tense moments and lots of eaten people.

0802473156|5.0|My love tank had been empty for so long, it was so wonderful to see why. I thought for the longest time something was wrong with me. My husband is words of acclamation. I always complimented him and said positive things about him, and he would do the same for me but for some reason I never remembered what he had said! It just wasn't as important to me as quality time was. We still struggle with the quality time as my love language because he's deployed on a boat and is so busy. He doesn't have time or the capability really to adhere to my specific love language. I know when he's home we'll go back to working on things, but after we read these books he made an effort and I was soooo happy and all \\"puffed up\\" from all this attention, which in turn made me a much happier person to be around. I hope when he comes home we can go back to having things work so wonderfully. I can't believe how much this changed in just a short amount of time when we desperately needed it.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The greatest and most romantic band ever released this masterpiece in 1965 that still sounds good today, in 2011. Even the worst Beatle song or album is way better than anyone else's worst song or album, and in this case, there isn't a lousy tune. Sure, the band released other CDs as well, but this... there's just something about this one. It's bright, happy, and just right. Did anyone else get the undercurrent of this piece of work? Some songs - Norwegian Wood, You Won't See Me, Run For Your Life, What Goes On, I'm Looking Through You, and Think For Yourself - deal with breaking up or lovers disappearing or somewhat cheating. Break-ups. Who hasn't gone through that? This CD speaks for us all. My favorite CD ever. I can play this anytime and I'll enjoy it. I remember really getting into while playing this in the mid-80s in my grandfather's room, in the car, etc. It's even now in my iPod. It's as good as gold. Get it.
0143038419|5.0|I had high expectations for the movie, based on this book--all of which were not met (as is the case with most films).  I am thankful that I watched the movie before I read the book, however.  It made me love the book even more.  I have found so many things to live by and carry with me through life in this read.  Gilbert has such a wonderful way to say such insightful things.  Everyone will not love every bit of it, but everyone can certainly find \\"something\\" here that they can love!!

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love this movie.  I had seen an earlier version a few years ago, but love this one more.
B00005V9HH|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Incredible writing, directing and acting.  STRONGLY recommend just not for youngsters as it is quite violent and has a plethora of vulgarity.  Need to pay close attention to this movie's dialogue and the actions of the characters so make sure you watch when you can give it your full attention.

B004M6BQ9W|5.0|I am one of those people that reads reviews but never comments.  This is my first review.  I am doing so because I am so completely pleased with the movie \\"Burlesque\\"!  Have you ever witnessed something so pure, so clean, so perfect that your hair on your scalp stands up and tingles?  Been awhile for me...I grew up loving the musicals such as Oklahoma, Music Man, Yentl, Funny Girl and so on...I have to say without a doubt this movie tops all of the the very best.  The critics?  Gimme a break!  This is exactly the perfect example why people cannot depend on the critics!  Rent it, Buy it and watch it...it may compell you to write about it like I did!!  I guarantee you won't be displeased!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Let me start by saying this is THE BEST SHOW ON TV period but dont just take my word for it. Entertainment Weekly Magazine claimed it so also. Why is it such a good show? The way the show enwraps you around every character to the point where you start caring about them. Forget the geeks that claim it is not sticking to the Comic book version. Who cares? It's no longer a comic book, it is a TV show now. Sure it's a zombie show and zombie movies are a dime a dozen but is NOT about the zombies but rather how the humans cope to survive and the struggles they go through in other to do so. Every week this show would leave you with a cliffhanger that would leave you wanting more and screaming at the tv for ending lol. Sure there are gory scenes ( those with weak stomachs will have to turn away ), I mean we are talking about a zombie show and zombies must be dealt with the only way there is. However the gore is pretty much limited to a couple of scenes per episode. This show is produced by Gale Ann Hurd former wife and colaborator of James Cameron which speaks volumes. Not because of her ties with him but her own credentials ( Original Terminator, Aliens ). In a tv world filled with crap reality shows about bitching, rich spoiled wives, fighting drunk bimbos and competition shows we have lost the Tv we once knew of well written scripts and cliffhangers. Well The Walking Dead has answered our prayers. I cant stress enough what a good and addictive show this is. In fact, so much so that many of my co-workers whom I have told to check it out have come back telling me \\" I cant believe Ive been missing out on this! \\" and you will too. Do yourself a favor and get this. IT MUST BE PART OF YOUR VIDEO LIBRARY.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I found this movie to be an amazing kinda whirlwind musical, historical tour through the mid to late sixties.  As I am a child of the sixties it was like taking this magical, snapshot tour through my own life that opened up memories, experiences and feelings I had long forgotten.  I bought the movie because I wanted it in my collection forever.  The music, the performances, the direction, cinematography, and story blew me away.  I will say that it probably makes more sense to people that grew up during that time, but my 21 year old daughter actually introduced it to me.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|Such a great 80s classic this movie really is. For me, one of the best Brooks' films ever and the most remarkable thing about this product is its condition of Region Free with multiple languages including Castilian Spanish. This is even more exciting, since this movie hasn't been released on Blu-Ray in Spain yet.<br /><br />Thank you, Mel and thank you Amazon!
0670022411|3.0|After reading many reviews I understand and sympathize with the two star and one star ones. I have a hard time truly rating this book. it was entertaining and I loved it but is not for everyone; there are parts that it dragged on forever and there were parts that were just a little too similar to twilight for my liking. I have to say that I agree with what people have said about this book being Dan brown meets Stephenie Meyer. Except for it lacks the sexual tension that SM can inject in to her books without being smutty or the excitement of chasing a mystery that Dan brown's books are known for. Not much happen in the book in all honesty, a few action parts but for the most part it was a lot of sitting around talking and planning. I pushed through the boring parts hoping for the action to finally pick up once the characters were all done planning, but a las the book ended tragically too soon.<br />I say read it but wait for the sequel to be out before diving into this series,  keep in mind that absolutely nothing gets resolved in this book and that (if you've read twilight) you won't be able to stop drawing parallels between the two.
B003UESJHY|4.0|This is great movie. The story is really impressive and the acting of Christian Bale and supporting actors is fantastic. Mark Wahlberg is well... Mark Wahlberg. He is not a great actor. But he does his best. And he is adequate for this movie. However Christian Bale pulls off a excellent performance. This a movie not about boxing but a family. In fact there is only a total of about a few minutes of actual fighting in the ring. But I think that why this movie is so successful. If there was more fighting it would seem hokey and boring. The boxing in this movie does seem authentic.

B004289ZW0|1.0|I'll make it brief- I use this in-flight with an iPad and ForeFlight. It works. One of the annoying things is that I don't know the state of the battery at any given point. Wouldn't it have been useful to have a battery meter? And the complaints about the finger slide on/off are pretty much correct- it's a temperamental interface that works... sometimes. A little better UI design would have made this a great 5 start product. As it stands, it works, but you have to be concerned not only about the iPad battery but the GPS battery too, which makes it a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Update 4/14/2011 - I now can officially say I HATE this device. I can't ever turn it off when I don't want it to be on, and many times I find it on in my bag or pocket. When I really need it, I don't know the state of the battery. Ugh, I wish I didn't buy this unit!<br /><br />Update 9/14/2011 - as of today, it finally won't even turn on anymore. It let me down right in the middle of an approach in the rain. Lucky it was just a backup to a REAL GPS. The company has the most draconian non-service policies you can imagine. This thing is a complete waste of money.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood.  I had high hopes from this movie,<br />but it was a miss-fire.<br /><br />There are three separate plot lines that eventually merge together.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is in the beginning when a tsunami hits,<br />but it lasts no more then a few minutes. French journalist Marie<br />has a near death experience which makes her curious with the afterlife.<br /><br />When she comes back to France, she changes her mind about writing a<br />political book, and instead wants to write about afterlife.  Her<br />manager thinks that a book on that topic would not sell in France<br />and gives her a list of publishers in the USA.  This makes me think that<br />people in the USA are either a) more open-minded, or b) easily duped.<br />Your pick.<br /><br />The second plot line is that Matt Damon had an operation in the past<br />that made him connect with the other side.  If this were a super-hero<br />movie, I would buy that idea no questions asked.  However, if this is<br />a realistic movie, then you have to ask the question why nobody else<br />who had a similar operation did not become gifted as he was.  Of course,<br />it is easy to create a 'WHOOSH' sound in the movie to force us think<br />that things like this can happen.<br /><br />The third story line is about a shoolboy Marcus who has a twin brother.<br />After his twin brother dies in an accident, he tries to find a way to<br />communicate with him through psychics, but they are all fakes.  But<br />then he meets Matt Damon and things change.  Somehow, just because<br />Matt Damon is the star of this movie, he can communicate with his<br />brother.  I just did not buy it.  I would put Matt Damon in the category of<br />fakes as well.  Because there is not a single thing that separates<br />him from the rest of the psychics, other than the fact that he is<br />the star of the movie.  Assuming of course that this is not a super-hero movie.<br /><br />I am rating this movie 1 star based only on its subject matter.  Acting,<br />directing etc may be good but it was very slow going for me.
1591843790|5.0|THE CHANT: Enchantment by Guy Kawasaki    From the start up, kick start maestro, a new book.     I've studied the strategies of Guy Kawasaki for a couple of decades. Working at Apple, during the early years as a design consultant, Guy swung into play just after my efforts designing for Steve Jobs and the product development team on Macintosh.     But in the emerging years, Guy had a way of channeling the spectacular creative energy of the organization to build insanely great, filtered and channeled examination of what really worked, during the heyday years into a kind of epistle of evangelism. Guy's real enthusiasm is perhaps the most infectious -- it's the drive of magnetic leadership and teams that are committed, equally passionate and on fire that will mobilize the continued links to the vitality of brand evolution. And the building of community.     The notion of community -- and enchantment -- is the heart fire of Kawasaki's principles. Not only has he formulated the right audience engagement methodology in the launching of his book concept, which has surged to the top of the chain of bestseller weeks in the opening sales of his first boost into the market. In a note, he offers in his typically ebullient manner, \\"I had a very happy moment this week because Enchantment made it to the New York Times bestseller list in the category of Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous. This happened in the first week that the book was available to the public.\\" This is an achievement.     More so, it points to how well he knows how to make it work. There's something to be said for the proverbial strategist that has plenty of theories, but rarely seems to mobilize them in actuality. Kawasaki's theories of conceptual innovation and audience embracement. Guy's search reveals a lot of giving (try Google, his name, to see what pops) -- which is at the heart of the strategy: (create) and give something thoughtfully amazing; people will be captivated (captured) and sing the chant of connection, spreading the word (and the world).     The idea of enchantment is really about that -- creating something remarkable, but then more importantly, building the internal teams, the motivations and connectedness, and finally how to  get that proposition out there in a manner that people listen, respond, engage and respond. Significantly, it's a lot more complicated than planners often think. \\"Sure, it's a great idea, people will buy it.\\" But where is, as Apple puts it, the magic. That idea of magic is surely part of the equation -- these days, we all need magic to be enchanted. Chanting is about magic and focused attention. Attention, as we all know from grade school, is where it's at. The more attention and commitment (by a guest, consumer, customer, experiencer) the more attention the originator can lavish on the teams that are supporting the brand, the story, and how that gets out to the rippling communities.     In Guy's worldly visioning, the drop of one pebble can be a beautiful gesture -- perhaps Zen-like in character, the contemplative sensation of total engagement -- and the vibration of that rippling, rolling out, like the watered movement of that expansion, sound waves, energy spreading the epiphany of surprise, amazement, wonderment and enchantment to the wild, wide and beautiful world.     Kawasaki's choice - enchantment, it's a long legacy back, perhaps 4,000 years to the seed sounds of ancient languages. To etymology? I go back:   chant: the last bridge to the present era, from the late 14th century, from Old French chanter \\"to sing, celebrate\\" (12c.), from there, the Latin cantare, frequentative of canere \\"sing,\\" from the ancient linguistic vortex, the Proto Indo European base *kan- \\"to sing\\" (cf. Greek: eikanos \\"cock,\\" Old English hana \\"cock,\\" both lit. \\"bird who sings for sunrise;\\" Old Irish caniaid \\"sings,\\" and the Welsh canu \\"sing\\"). The frequentative quality of the word was no longer felt in Latin, and by the time French emerged the word hadentirely displaced canere. Related words?  Chanted; chanting. The noun is recorded from 1670s, from French, derived from Latin cantus, from past participle stem of canere.    Enchantment -- surely, do you sing the song? Guy's book is a detailed orchestration of that principle -- it's not a superficial personal branded marketing enterprise, it's a tool book to make it happen.     Sing, now, the chant and be enchanted.   Buy it, here.     t i m   ---  CREATING BRANDS THAT ARE LOVED:  [...]

I just finished my first workout with this video and absolutely love it. It will definitely work your muscles if you do it right.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies I have seen in years.  When I can find a historical drama which my husband also enjoys a.e. no special effects, no animation, no \\"fights to the death\\", etc., I know we have a 5 star movie.  I was so pleased to see Colin Firth get the best actor Oscar, which is long overdue in my opinion, and The Kings Speach get the Best Picture Oscar.  This is one movie that certainly deserved awards.
0740748475|5.0|Wow I have to say, this is a beautifully designed collection. It met all my expectations and more! It was lovingly shipped to my tiny residence in a tiny island all the way from the US to the pacific. The book was beautifully coloured, illustrated and we enjoyed reading every minute of the author's note in the beginning.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|Only Clooney could have pulled this off. He left you with so many unanswered questions!!!!  This is up there with Frantic, and I loved it. Clooney certainly delivers the most mysterious thriller of a lifetime.   Buy it. Sure there is going to be action buffs disappointed with this film only because there is not an ongoing shooting fest a tevery corner.  That is not what this about.  This is about instinctive survival. He delivers a knock out punch in that dept.     I won't spoil the ending.
B000000W6F|3.0|It's good for first album I guess. My thing is, I've walked backward through the Pumpkins' albums, so Gish seems lack-luster to me. It was interesting to hear Corgan shred like that though. It's definitely not the case nowadays. The music is a little pretentious but definitely has the Pumpkins ring to it. There's nothing special about this album. I'd say it's a once a year listen album.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second in his series of three books with Salander as his main character and I didn't think it possible, but this just might be better than the first book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.

0060090383|5.0|Rachel's Holiday is the third book in Keyes' four-part series on Dublin's Walsh sisters (hopefully we'll get fifth sister Helen's story someday).  Rachel is the middle sister, living in New York and happily hitting the bars every night.  In Rachel's mind, she's living \\"Sex and the City.\\"  In reality, she's closer to \\"Trainspotting.\\"  She ignores her chronic drug and alcohol problems, and even when her super-sexy boyfriend Luke (also an Irish transplant) gives her an ultimatum, she won't get clean.<br /><br />Rachel's family forces her into rehab, and she can't wait to hit the spa.  Rehab is just a place where Hollywood stars go to dry out while they get massages, right?  At The Cloisters, however, Rachel is forced to confront her addictions and the damage she's done to her friends and family.  Rachel's Holiday can be depressing at times, and I cried more than once, but the resolution is believable and satisfying.<br /><br />Marian Keyes talks at length on her website about her struggles with depression, and all we can do is hope that she gets better so that she can start writing once again.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Say what you will, but the classic Universal Monsters had style, grace and class. Often considered outrageously lurid and shocking in their own time, they now function as models of restraint compared to their contemporary successors. Heck, even Frankenstein's monster has the good manners to wear a suit whilst conducting his murderous rampage throughout the countryside!<br /><br />Having grown up watching Universal's [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS Dracula]] (1931), I came pretty late to the party when developing a similar affinity for this film. I'd always preferred \\"Dracula\\"'s stately, mannered, gothic atmosphere, so it took me many years -- and the perspective of adulthood -- to appreciate this film's more aggressive, darkly humourous tone.<br /><br />While less flamboyant (read: camp) than its somewhat more comedic sequel, the 1931 Universal \\"Frankenstein\\" adapts Mary Shelley's original 1818 novel as a straight up, tightly wound little horror film, infused with a gleefully grotesque sense of wit. Karloff's portrayal of the monster is an accomplished pantomime; a combination of pathos, innocence and rage that favourably compares to some of the greatest silent film performances from films like [[ASIN:B0000AINLS Sunrise]] and [[ASIN:0780022343 The Passion of Joan of Arc]]. The film itself is an intriguing stylistic amalgam of theatrical histrionics, shadowy German Expressionism and technical showmanship that, in these DVD restorations, is truly wondrous to behold.<br /><br />As of this writing, Universal have released no fewer than three separate DVD editions of \\"Frankenstein.\\" The original 1999 edition, which I personally own, is still widely available on Amazon. The newer [[ASIN:B0001CNRLQ Legacy Collection]] and [[ASIN:B000GPIPT2 75th Anniversary]] editions contain similarly excellent film transfers and many of the same special features, with the addition of sequels in the former release and additional documentary material in the latter. Whichever version you choose is, therefore, entirely a matter of pricing, convenience and desired extras.<br /><br />Given its importance to the development of early horror cinema, any horror fan worth their salt should see Universal's \\"Frankenstein\\" at least once during their lifetime. Any serious collector should consider adding it to their library, if they haven't done so already. In any event, spending a candlelit evening with such an entertaining classic is a no-lose proposition.ore, entirely a matter of pricing, convenience and desired extras.<br /><br />Given its importance to the development of early horror cinema, any horror fan worth their salt should see Universal's \\"Frankenstein\\" at least once during their lifetime.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|First, I admire Clint Eastwood's films. They are made with talent and are usually interesting. Second, he dropped the ball here. Yes, he did a professional job with fine actors but they were in the service of a boring, slow drunk hippo of a movie. It starts out well enough with a good SFX sections and then gets slower and slower and slower. There are 3 stories (at least) going on here. One of the stories could easily have been left out to shorten this film so we could get to the sappy ending. I wonder if Clint made this film so he could get a studio-paid trip to Europe?
B004NOH9LW|4.0|The movie is not so much about death or dying. It is more about how the mind and body are connected in efforts to survive, and how we connect with other people in those efforts as well. It illustrates that the brain releases the functioning of the senses so that the body can do what it does to survive, while the mind takes us on a trip to never never land.    The movie talks about social groups and individuals who gravitate about the subject. It talks about people who deeply miss loved ones, or are trying to understand their own experiences. It talks about pubic conversations on the subject.    The results of the struggle for the characters are that the boy becomes calmer about his brother, and the man and woman find a transition to a new beginning once they have the information they need to go forward with their lives. Truth be told, we go forward even without the information, but having it loosens the grip of the trauma.    It is a good thing that the artists did for us. They did it well enough. It is for us to study the movie if need be, and learn the lessons it teaches. Thankfully, it can be watched by most people. I'm certain the movie will help novices approach the subject from a healthy perspective, and because of that the movie will have longevity in the public eye.
B003L77G06|5.0|I knew my wife loved Modern Family, but I also knew she didn't really start watching until near the end of the first season.  Amazon had the whole first season on DVD, and I thought, why not see if she likes this as a birthday gift?  Probably one of the best gift decisions I've ever made.  Except even though she watches the show religiously on TV, I also know she's going to EXPECT to get Season 2 on DVD as soon as it comes out.  Amazon, please keep me in mind when it does!
0439023513|5.0|I am just so impressed with this entire series, and this book in particular. Like the Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games trilogy shows how \\"young adult fiction\\" has become something of an anachronism, perhaps doing a disservice to the books themselves and the complexity of the content in them.    I couldn't stop reading this book; I was hooked and saddened and fascinated by the events that unfold in it and its predecessors. In some ways the series reminded me of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV show, where the characters face making decisions where there are no right answers. Katniss Everdeen is a fascinating character, a young woman placed into a series of horrible situations and forever changed by them. The series is a great study of the evils and realities of war and rebellion and also the complexities of love.    Collins also has the rare ability to conjure a rich world with pleasingly stark prose; she doesn't spend much time on describing the world of Panem in insane detail, and yet she still manages to convey an incredibly clear vision of the dystopian future world. I also usually hate first-person perspective; I usually find it somewhat annoying to read, but Collins manages to use it to her advantage in all of the books.    The ending of Mockingjay is not fairy-tale-perfect by any means, but the subject matter with which it deals is not the sort of thing that lends itself to such endings. Not to be trite, but like many things in life, I think this series is a lot about the journey as opposed to the destination, and it very much succeeds on that front. Even though the ending isn't all wrapped up in a neat little package, taken as a whole it is immensely satisfying. I think if Collins had ended the series on a shiny-happy note that it would have downplayed the seriousness of the subject matter and the experience of the characters, and that the lessons that the books contain would be lessened as a result.    In any case, this is really one of the most enjoyable series of books I have ever read, and I will be thinking about them for a long time. Really great stuff.
B000GIXE4K|5.0|well..after first seeing nightwish on a dvd on a surround sound and high def tv i was blown away with this band and tarja as the lead singer...ive seen everyone live..have been going to live shows since the sixties..and i think this last show with tarja was the most awsome concert that i have ever seen in my life..WOW...tarja could only be compared to maybe sara brightman.and each member of the nightwish band was awsome. I REALLY think that if tarja had stayed with them they were on their way to being the greatest band since the beatles.almost cried when i found out about her leaving and not to put anyone down...who could ever take her place???..the dvd...as i said is absolutely incredible ...and the louder the better.loved their phantom of the opera..however the cd audio sounded to me like it was recorded on a tape recorder by someone sitting in the back when compared to the dvd..my advice..is get the dvd.. the quality is by far the best,besides..seeing the show is way better than just hearing it.I was left with the impression that this cd is of a low sound quality..however i may order another dvd just in case my present one gets scratched because im NOT going without this conccert in my collection.I watch it over and over.ONE INCREDIBLE SHOW.
0756405890|5.0|I'll just repost from my Goodreads review:    Reviewing this book has proven difficult, as I'm having trouble heaping upon it the praise it deserves without sounding ridiculously maudlin or fanboyish.     So, listen: this is a perfect example of skill and tone and form making ordinary ingredients into something extraordinary. I've read some tepid and negative reviews, and they all focus on either not liking the character or finding specific narrative elements trite or overdone (e.g., \\"The university setting was better in Harry Potter!\\" or \\"Oh, this is just another poor-boy-becomes-hero wish fulfillment fantasy\\").     To some extent, this is correct: it is about a poor boy that becomes a hero. But it's really about the sometimes-terrible price of notoriety; about the loneliness of the great; about the arrogance of the elite and the double-edged blessing of pride. It's about the curse of getting what you wish for and the ordeal of living in interesting times.     And it's written with such unrepentant enthusiasm and wit and self-awareness and *heart* that I just can't not like it. I suspect that when SkyNet takes over and we are hunted by the Machines, we will use dogs as the primary method of detecting Terminators and the suspect's opinion on \\"The Name of the Wind\\" as secondary verification of their humanity.     I try to remain mindful of the subjectivity of fiction and other people's tastes, but for this book, I cannot even feign evenhandedness or maturity: loving \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is the only Correct response.
B00260HH3K|1.0|The movie sucks so bad it couldn't pay me $3.99 to watch.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|Sadly, there are very few films that are capable of eliciting a visceral reaction out of me. However, Mike Nichol's 1966 debut film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is such a powerful film on so many levels that I cannot imagine anybody watching it without being significantly moved. The film is based on Edward Albee's Tony Award winning play and covers the events of one very long and alcohol induced night. It follows the plight of an aging couple George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). When friends Nick (George Segal)  and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over for a nightcap, they become caught in the middle of a series of games in which George and Martha take their pain and attempt to push each other to the breaking point. Albee's dialogue is explosive, both in terms of being emotionally charged and how it is projected, and is adeptly handled by the entire cast.. There is a brilliant mix of temperamental humor and anguish which includes one of my favorite lines, \\"There isn't an abomination award going that you haven't won.\\"   While Albee's superb script provides a well-built chassis for the film, it is Nichol's direction mixed with Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography that makes this film really take off. Often times the camera will capture the scene as if it were merely a fly on the wall. However, Nichols really knows the material and will zoom in to the point of intrusion when a character feels emotionally isolated or verbally backed into a corner. In one particularly distinguished scene that deviates from the play, Nichols captures George walking into the back of the house when the Martha and the guests are still conversing in the living room. Even though George is out of ear shot of the others, Nichols keeps the audio of their conversation going while he follows George. This illuminates the extent of Martha's deviance as George can still knows that Martha will be speaking ill of him even when he is not in her company. Also, in the same vein as a noir, Nichols uses mirrors to show how these characters never take a good hard look at themselves and what they have become. One is even shoved in the face of George at one point, yet he is too steeped in his own misery to even see the man on the other side.   The performances here are simply astounding by all players involved. Although Taylor would nab the Oscar for best actress, I really feel as though Burton was snubbed. While his character could have just been watered down to nothing more than a dispensary of caustic wit, Burton injects a sense of humanity into the character that is present in the smallest of gestures.    Historically, this film is bold as it was produced in some of the most impassioned years of the civil rights movement.  These years saw a mass movement to finally put an end to the anti-miscegenation laws that had previously prevented interracial marriages in America. This film shows that even white upper-middleclass marriages, which were seen as a bulwark against the decay of the human race, had their blemishes.   In the end, it is a beautiful film about a volatile relationship. It is about pain and the fiction that we manufacture in order to deal with it. The film isn't easy to watch, but if you do you will find that this is an absolutely astounding film.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|Let me start off by saying the show is 5 stars, the review is for the packaging. I can't say enough good things about the writing, the cast or the gritty realism of the show (especially as a long-time pan-geek from an early age). Unfortunately, content is only pleasant if it's viewable.     It's been said before, the big Cylon head version is terrible. The discs slide around in the cardboard sleeves and arrive damaged. That's old news at this point. New information is that Universal has decided (as of May 31, 2010) to stop replacing their defective packaging. Without recalling their shoddy workmanship, which is a nice touch.     They will replace damaged discs if you get them the disc number and chapter and timecode when it skipped. So be prepared to watch the whole series in 30 days to make sure it works at all. Universal, of course will replace the defective discs in 2-4 weeks, so they're not nearly as rigid about their own timelines as they are about the customer's. :) I haven't yet, but take my advice, buy the new version. It can't be any worse. It's not defective, and you won't have to deal with Universal's questionable customer service practices (unless something goes wrong-in which case best of luck).

B004FGMV0W|5.0|The best work Avril Lavigne has ever done. When I first listened to it, I thought it was okay, but when listened to it for the second and third time, I started realizing how amazing the songs are. Don't be a quick judge. Listen to Smile, and I Love You; they are the best songs !
0891419063|5.0|Sledge's description of what he and his fellow Marines experience in the Pacific fighting the Japanese is one of the best autobiographies I have ever read.  This is the real story and horror of war, not the dressed up versions you see in the usual Hollywood movies.  This book gave me a new appreciation for men and women who fight our wars.  I couldn't put it down.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Besides loving all the material included in this CD, I have to praise the seller for the promptness in sending this item in a very short time.  The CD arrived at my address in perfect conditions and the only problem that I am facing is to be able to stop listening to it.  This makes me wonder why all the Old CDs by The Beatles are not remastered to this format (DVD-Audio-DTS) because in this way, you are able to catch new sounds in every track they have recorded, something that is simply impossible when you listen to the normal stereo(2-channel) versions.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|My kids love these films.  They have good characters and slapsticky jokes, complicated plots (OK formulas), and plenty of opportunites for bonding.  After seeing them once or twice, they pretty much become background noise for us parents, but that is fine.<br /><br />Recommended as throwaway entertainment with good themes about teamwork amidst diversity.
B001KQEA5E|5.0|Seriously, rarely have I ever heard an album where every song is fantastic. This album is one of those rare albums. There was nothing like it back then in 1993. Dr. Dre's production is mindblowing and outstanding and Snoop's never had better flow than this album. Also, every other artist featured in this album like Warren G., Nate Dogg, Lady of Rage and Kurrupt totally add to this album. In rap it's often the case that too many featuring artists ruin the stew but not on this album. This album is solidly great from start to finish. A true gem and milestone of gangsta rap. No serious rap/hip-hop fan should go another day without listening to this album from start to finish at least once in their lifetime.

0802798225|5.0|Wow. This was such an awesomely amazing book. I love everything about Perfect Chemistry. The main characters are fleshed out and through the first person point of view, I was able to make a deep connection with them. The side characters have their own stories to tell and they weren't just glanced upon but added to the complexity of the novel. I also enjoyed the realness of the story. Elkeles doesn't shy away from the realities of being a teenager and that includes sex. Perfect Chemistry is a highly addictive read that I will remember for years to come.<br /><br />I really felt for Brittany. She puts up the facade of perfection for others around her to see so they won't see the problems in her life. Her parents are overly concerned with outward appearances and that influences their interactions with each other. Brittany adores her sister Shelley, who had cerebral palsy. She keeps up the perfect act so her parents have more time for Shelley and so they won't send her away. Brittany is a very complex character who goes through so much and her interactions with Alex changes her for the better. Their romance is forbidden which makes for an even crazier ride! There is so much chemistry between these two that I can practically feel the smoke coming from the pages! Their bantering with each other adds to their complicated relationship and makes for a wild romance.<br /><br />Alex is as deep and complicated as Brittany. He puts on the tough gang member act so he can protect his family. He doesn't want his younger brothers to get involved in the Blood so he gets involved for them. Alex cares deeply for his family and will do anything for them. When he is assigned to be partners with Brittany in chemistry, he is upset that he has to work with Miss Perfect but takes advantage of it to tease her. Through their times together, Alex begins to see thaat Brittany isn't so perfect after all and even shows a little of who he really is to her. Though their relationship is not an easy one, they find that they cannot be without each other.<br /><br />Through the character building, Elkeles weaves a fantasticly complex story. I enjoyed every moment of the novel and wish that I could have savored it more. I wasn't even 100 pages in when I had to go out and buy the sequel, Rules of Attraction! Elkeles is a superb author whose work is breathtaking! I can't believe it took me this long to try Perfect Chemistry but i'm glad that I finally did. If you're like me and have waited this long to read Perfect Chemistry, don't wait any longer. You won't be disappointed and will find yourself craving her other novels!at they cannot be without each other.    Through the character building, Elkeles weaves a fantasticly complex story.

0763644765|3.0|Bought this for my 18m old.  She enjoys seeing the baby and the animals.    I found it lacking. It spent so much time addressing if the kid wanted to use the potty that it doesn't really talk about what happens afterward (wiping, hand washing). It also bothered me how many times it shows the kid getting off the potty. My daughter looks at the pics and gets up to imitate him which is not the part I want her to emulate!    Honestly though, I haven't really found many potty books I am altogether happy with. This is probably one of the better ones, but I still am not thrilled about it. It lacks educationally. Guess you can't win them all.

044661758X|5.0|I've been working my way through the Bosch series that Connelly has written and this, the third book in the series, was by far the best. There is no room for blonde jokes or getting ones feet stuck in concrete as this is one novel whose pace is steady and is never at any point dumbed down for the reader.     Finally in this novel we get to see Harry in a more intimate light. He's still having major trust issues with his job, he is in a relationship he wants to make work, all while being in court for a reckless kill. Did he shoot the wrong man? Would he do it again? His life is in the hands of other people for the most part... except that's never the case with Mr Bosch. He's not one to sit by and let life float away.    New kills, tackling lawyers, trying to make a relationship work, whose the inside rat... not to mention he's been called in, in secret no less, to help track down this copycat. Or is it a copycat? Did he make a mistake?     No spoilers from this review!    [[ASIN:044661758X The Concrete Blonde (Harry Bosch)]] was a book you could submerge yourself into. I'm looking forward to book four and hope the pace continues! I highly recommend this book. Best in the series so far!
0060775858|5.0|My children love the rhyme-like feel of this book's passages.  By saying \\"goodnight\\", the child puts everything in its proper place and is finally ready for a night's sleep.  My only criticism is that I wish the book was a little longer.  My daughter is sometimes sad because the story ends, so I have to start from the beginning; but that is the sign of a good book.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|Excellent movie. Watch it on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for better cerebral appreciation, when you are possibly not drunk!    Ignore the juvenile comments of people who have given it lesser ratings.  If you can appreciate smart movies, you'll feel good about having watched this one.  It's like that graceful lady you dated but couldn't marry...you'll feel good that you at least fell for a good one like that!    George Clooney and Matt Damon both have done an excellent job.  Yes, you have to follow the movie closely and things will become clearer halfway through. If that is tough for you, read the wikipedia commentary of the plot and then watch it.  It's not a suspense thriller, so knowing the plot won't kill the enjoyment of watching the movie
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|My kids and I love this show! The relationship between Merlin and Arthur is humorous and yet full of depth and magic in itself. The special effects are very good for a television show, but more importantly this is a character driven adventure that is well written and FUN!

B004M1MHMM|5.0|Because it's not very pretty and doesn't contain a lot of bells and whistles, I doubt that the Numark PT-01USB will score well with music purists. But if you're looking for an inexpensive way to get your record collection digitized, this is the USB turntable you're looking for.    It's not automatic, if that's important to you -- you have to do your own cueing and moving the arm after a side is played. The built-in speaker makes it easy to have it next to your computer and monitor the recording. If you're not in a position to listen, just plug in some headphones -- there are jacks for plugs both big and small.     The PT-01USB can handle all three record speeds, 33, 45 (look sharp, or you'll miss the adapter) and 78. While I was quite pleased with the overall sound quality, my first recording attempt was too low in volume. I found the solution in the user manual -- adjusting the turntable's gain control.    Though the PT-01USB works with both Mac and Windows, I suggest you ditch the software supplied in favor of a download of the free audio editing software Audacity -- the Mac version is outdated anyway. But that's the nastiest thing I can say about this product.    During its \\"down time,\\" the PT-01USB can be hooked up to \\"normal\\" speakers via its RCA plugs, and it's portable to boot! The dust cover doubles as a lid and there's a built-in handle -- add six D batteries, and you're mobile!    As an inexpensive replacement turntable that can digitize my vinyl, I say that the Numark PT-01USB fills the bill and already paid for itself.

B002ZG98UA|4.0|Resident Evil:Afterlife(released Sept/10)is the fourth live action movie of the franchise and from my point of view it is a step up from its' predecessor \\"Apocalypse\\".The action is hot and heavy,the S/FX are excellent and Milla Jovovich keeps the proceedings well grounded;her character fits her like a glove.<br />The plot in Afterlife continues where Apocalypse left off.Alice(Jovovich) and her clones from the Umbrella facility in the desert in the U.S. are in Tokyo,Japan and on a mission to destroy the main facility led by Albert Wesker(Shawn Roberts).The clones do most of the dirty work,many getting taken out in the process.Wesker manages to escape in a Black Ops VTOL craft but the original Alice is aboard.Wesker nukes the Tokyo facility from the air but Alice and he duke it out on the aircraft.Alice gets injected with a serum that neutralizes the T-Virus and she becomes human once more.However before either of them can do anything,the aircraft,unpiloted during this time,plunges into the side of a Japanese mountain.Alice is the only one who seemingly walks away from the crash alive.<br />The scene now switches to Alice who has commandeered an aircraft.She has flown across the Pacific and is heading for Arcadia,Alaska,the place mentioned from Apocalypse that was supposedly infection free.She lands in a field chock full of abandoned aircraft of all types and no one is around.She wanders to a beach but before long is attacked.It turns out to be Claire(Ali Larter) who has a strange metal spider-like device attached to her chest.Alice removes it but Claire,obviously heavily drugged,cannot remember Alice or much else.Alice loads Claire into the two seater plane and both head south along the Pacific coast.In L.A. they encounter a small group on a rooftop who are signaling for help.They cannot land below as it is surrounded by the undead.It's a nail biting sequence but she manages to land successfully on the roof top.<br />This is the \\"Citadel\\" prison but they cannot stay too long here as the undead are slowly starting to find ways into the supposedly impregnable facility.In the facility the group is holding one prisoner,a military man,Chris(Wentworth Miller),who got caught up in the exodus of his long gone comrades.He has a way out and,realizing they don't have many options left,the group finally releases him.Upon release Chris looks at Claire and introduces himself as her brother.He tries to hug her but Claire not recognizing him,puts him in a back hand lock.She releases him at Alice's insistence and Alice tells Chris she cannot remember much due to her past ordeal in Arcadia.<br />Things are going from bad wot worse in the facility.\\"Knocking\\" at the main gate is a huge brute wielding a king sized axe and many of the undead have now mutated into new forms.The newest are now tunneling their way into the Citadel through the walls as they have tentacles that emanate out of their mouths.Not only great for digging but it's how they grasp their victims.The group heads downwards to the sewers,which will lead them to the ocean.Off the coast lies their destination.It is a ship called the Arcadia.This seems to be the source of the transmissions for safe refuge that Alice and the others have been receiving all along,not in Alaska.<br />They get a boat and board the ship;it seems deserted.Below decks lies huge long containers which contain the answers to some of their questions.It seems the Umbrella corporation has been snatching survivors and putting them in cryogenic freezing for further experimentation.A little farther along they run into none other than Wesker who has been waiting for Alice and her compatriots.Wesker has been monitoring Alice all along and he has now infected himself with the T-virus and hopes with an infusion of the blood Alice carries he can successfully control the bad side of the virus.Alice of course has other plans.First she dispatches his two \\"dogs\\";also mutants whose heads split open to reveal the creature inside.After their demise she,Claire and her brother finally \\"subdue\\" Wesker.They release the rest of the cryo-frozen cargo of uninfected but Wesker,thought dead,escapes in a VTOL.He has the same plans to destroy the ship as he did the facility in Japan but this time Alice is one step ahead of him.She has planted a nuclear device on his aircraft which sends Wesker to meet his maker.Alice sends out a radio broadcast to all survivors who may out there offering now a true refuge for them aboard the Arcadia.The movie ends with a slew of VTOL black ops aircraft heading towards the boat as Alice says:\\"Here comes trouble\\".<br />With that ending we can see another sequel on the horizon,that is for sure.If the producers can keep up their sure fire and imaginative stories for this ever-burgeoning franchise,there is no where to go but up.After life is a definite improvement in story construction and plot evolvement over Apocalypse.The movie moves along at a more brisk pace and doesn't get bogged down in trivials like some its predecessors.Jovovich continues to be the glue that grounds this franchise.She is firmly ensconced in her Alice character and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the great job she has done so far.This movie also has a plethora of special effects in it and the stunt work is amazing.The film certainly and more than once,references the ground breaking work of the Matrix but Afterlife still stands on its own.<br />Technically the film has been transferred wonderfully to DVD and is clear and crisp.It appears in its' original a/r of 2:35:1 but is NOT in 3-D,as originally shot.However this lack of 3-D is no deterrent to the films enjoyability.As an aside I cannot wait until this 3-D craze runs its course and disappears from the scene once more.Wearing glasses at a theatre is one thing but at home constantly?......C'mon!!! .Extras include: commentary,trailer,previews,a two featurettes on the action and the cast.<br />Afterlife is a very good sequel in the Resident Evil franchise,a better turn than its predecessor.The

B0034G4ORC|4.0|First of all, this is not an Original Movie like the name of the production company \\"Original Films\\" would lead you to believe.  The plot is the same as we have seen, Alien Invasion for our resources.  In a bit of an original twist, they are after our WATER instead of oil or metals.    They come in a typical manner, as meteorites and they invade large coastal towns.  The US Marines are the focus of the military operation in this film as usual.  By the time the World realizes they are being colonized, the only major city left to defend is LA.    AWSOME CGI and AMAZING battle scenes make this film worth seeing...
1594202842|5.0|This thin books is an honest attempt to lets others see what it takes to be a Chinese Mother. Amy Chua is also honest enough to tell us these methods do not always work with American Chinese - Jewish children. I found the book funny and revealing. I teach Asian - American students and am always amazed that an A- is a tragedy. Perfect SAT scores are expected. Perfect grades and oh, yes perfect dogs. This type of parenting is not limited to the Chua household. This is also the story of the death of a beloved grandmother and the cancer and recovery of a beloved sister. Chua had a lot on her plate although she is far from a perfect Mother she tries.  Her love and devotion to her daughters comes out on every page. You will be yelling \\"enough already\\" after the first chapter but so were her daughters. Only Chua is hones enough to tell the entire story without trying to make herself the perfect Mom.
0385333846|2.0|This book is very easy to read, but not very gripping.  I heard its supposed to be an antiwar book and funny it was neither.  Its about a weak man with no volition.

Words do not do justice to his portrayal of the classics whether it be \\"Put a Spell on You\\" or \\"Over the Rainbow\\".

I noticed in the third program that the primers were missing from cartridges for a machine gun belt that was going to be used.  The cartridege heads looked like wood plugs that someone tried to pass off as bullets.  Don't waist your money.

The printed installation instructions are unreadable, they refer to files names that are not in the Mac subdirectory of  the driver CD they included,  There are multiple driver or ??? files on the CD in the Mac folder on the CD they  provide but nothing to tell you what they are.   It is just not clear what is what.

That is a file which does not seem to exist on my Mac, and  then they offer  instructions to install various files.   I did find one person advising installation of a file that actually matched a file name on the CD in the BU-353  Box.   By that point,  I had no confidence in the sources of the information I was reading on line, I had no idea what to do about the missing ( or was it just renamed?) file they were telling me to delete.     I just put everything back in the box and put the box on a shelf  in my den and decided this was yet another software product that is too hard to install, and rendered useless  by instructions.

0060527986|3.0|Whittling 15 down to 5...I propose that the top 5 quotes from this book are:<br /><br />  5. \\"A Warrior never picks fruit while it is still green.\\" (p.40)<br /><br />  4. \\"[A Warrior of the Light] rarely discusses his plans [for] he knows that whenever he talks about a dream, he uses a little bit of the energy from that dream in order to do so...A Warrior of the Light knows the power of words.\\" (p.98)<br /><br />  3. \\"[A Warrior of the Light's] soul is as free as the clouds in the sky, but he is committed to his dream. On his freely chosen path, he often has to get up earlier than he would like, speak to people from whom he learns nothing, make certain sacrifices...[but] he knows that an open oven bakes no bread.\\" (p.47)<br /><br />  2. \\"The great victory, which appears so simple today, was the result of a series of small victories that went unnoticed.\\" (p.123)<br /><br />...and my pick for the No.1 quote is...<br /><br />  1. \\" `I've been through all this before,' he says to his heart.<br />  \\" `Yes, you have been through all this before,' replies his heart. `But you have never been beyond it.' \\" (p.10)<br /><br />From The Uncustomary Book Review.
B003Q6D27S|2.0|The Saw series has had it's up and downs... Mostly it has retained enough entertainment to keep viewers coming back.  The weakest of them being Saw V.  Saw Vi came back with a great amount of steam...So I anticipated the end of the story to be just as good.  But no a dissapointing full circle plot.  This film was condensed from two films and rushed.  Jigsaw has a minor role in the film though his cameo is a pleasant one, it does not feel like a Saw movie.  It feels like a watered down version of a flashy slasher flick.  I hope they do make 8 just to make up for how uncreative this installment is..
0061537969|2.0|I am shocked by the number of 5 star reviews for this book - it's the cheesiest, least interestesting book I've read in ages.  The first chapter is intentionally tear jerking (it took me a few days to pull myself together enough to finish it), and is followed by pages and pages of unbelievably ridiculous narration from a dog with above human level intelligence.  Couple that with the fact that the story revolves around car racing and you have yourself a book that I couldn't even bring myself to read on a 5 hour plane ride.  The author is clearly trying to appeal to every dog owner's love of their dog, but it is so gimmicky and far fetched that it just comes off as insincere.  It's like Garth Stein found a formula for a best seller and spewed it out without much thought onto 200 pages.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I've been a big fan of the original series NCIS from the beginning. As the spin off aired I also started to watch this and as I've so far all 7 seasons of NCIS, I also wanted NCIS:L.A. Until now I don't regret having bought this DvDs. NCIS:L.A. is a good series with interesting characters! I love Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J. A must have!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Summer Wars is an awesome friggin' movie--it's got a rich blend of sci-fi, fantasy, humor, romance, action, etc. with great characters and a fun setting. The only real problem I had with the movie itself was the vague anti-american vibe you get.    Unfortunately, I bought it on Blu Ray by accident. I can still watch it on my PS3, but I can't bring it over to my friends' houses and show it to them! I friggin' hate blu-ray because it's generally more expensive (not in this case), requires a separate player, and just isn't really any better than a DVD! Plus, all blu-ray disks come in a garish blue plastic case that is a different size than DVD's and video games, so they really stand out in your collection. If you like blu-rays, however, knock yourself out.
1594202842|5.0|The negative reviews show a gut opposition to the author's method of child-rearing. The reasons these reviewers give (those who do give reasons) aren't persuasive. The indisputable fact is that children raised with more discipline become better adults.

B000003CM9|5.0|Great tracks.  Like to make my own with the car running down the road.  Packaged and quality music.
0307474712|3.0|A generous three stars for the interesting premise of telling the story of a relationship by dipping into a couples lives on the same day each year.   I'm sure it'll make an entertaining romantic comedy movie but hopefully Dexter won't be such a pathetic loser and Emma will have a spine. Otherwise who would care what happens to these people? And what will Hollywood do about that ending?
B001UFQNF0|3.0|This is probably the best toy Delorian made to date and I put the emphasis on TOY.<br />If you are buying this for a child, they will probably love it.<br />It's big enough to fit 3 3/4 inch action figures.<br />It has various sound and light effects.<br />The dash along with the flux capasitor inside the car light up which I think is a really good feature.<br />The Mr Fusion comes with the car but not in it. You have to install it.<br />Quite easy but also quite unnecessary.<br />There is no point in making it removable.<br />The movable wheels and opening doors give this car the charecter of the original.<br />A child could play with this for a while before getting bored.<br /><br />As a Collectors item DON'T CONSIDER THIS OVERSIZED CHEAP SUNSTAR RIPOFF.<br />At 1/15 scale this could be nothing but a childs toy.<br />Made of plastic<br />Poorly constructed, the hood or bonnet does not set in flush.<br />The lights only come on when you push the button.<br />It does not have a display lighting mode.<br />You cannot mute the sound and enjoy the light effects alone.<br />The detail in this model is So So,<br />There no Delorian name plate or logo found anywhere on the car which make it even more of a \\"bootleg\\" product.<br />This car feels light and flimsy.<br />The door panel and seats can and will pop out.<br />The wheel movement is sloppy.<br />The paint job is off, It does not look like steel.<br />Anything below 1/18 is toy territory so don't expect a model car collector to be able to appreciate this gigantic 1/15 size plastic toy delorian.<br />If Diamond Select had put display lights on a properly detailed standard 1:18 size diecast model without the annoying sound effects, They would have had a winner, but as it is, they made this \\"thing\\".<br />Sunstar and Welly are the model brands to have.<br />Diamond Select should stick with figure design and Entertainment Earth should find another product to put their \\"Exclusive\\" logo on.
B001KEGRCA|2.0|The title of this feature is somewhat disingenuous, smacking of \\"bait and switch\\". A more accurate title might read something like: \\"Colorado River Conservation Propaganda and Why the Glen Canyon Dam is BAAAD (and with some majestic fly-over scenes of the Grand Canyon thrown in here and there)\\". While all or at least most of such IMAX productions have obligatory (often insipid) story lines, this production is so insistent on flooding the viewer with conservation messages (many of which appear to be anecdotal and/ or trite) that it becomes annoying. It is as if this feature was produced by a group of idealistic, and very naïve, junior high school students, and aimed at a similar audience . Yes, the photography is often remarkable, with filming done on bright sunny days, resulting in bright, brilliant images. Unfortunately, there seems to be more footage of people sharing their thoughts/ personal opinions about this and that than footage involving fly-over scenes of the grand/ majestic canyon.
B003UESJHO|3.0|This is a poorly done film, quite a step down because of the other better made movies about fighting.  Christian Bale...he will do anything to make his character believable, losing so much weight and looking like a crackhead.  I admire him tremendously.  Mark Wahlberg, he was not allowed to break out that magnificent performance he always gives, as well as his girlfried, Amy Adams.  The whole trashy family thing, with the ridiculous sisters....yak.  But, it was based on a true story so I guess all that fried hair was necessary LOL.  Overall, I was disappointed.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Credibility:   The movie was in immediate \\"credibility\\" trouble when one of our stars is hanging onto a tree in the midst of a raging mountainous raging river of a tsunami and   (a.) as someone who has rafted the Snake River in Hell's Canyon I'll tell you right now that was not possible; she would have sucked in water and been dragged under.  (b.) while clinging to the tree she is hit by a car floating at a high rate down stream and ends up with a bruise -  should have been crushed.  (c.) the amount of time she's under with no control - she should have drowned.  (d.) but, somehow she's suddenly appears on a roof top being resuscitated.   I know, picky but that sets the tone for how the movie is being produced. One hour and fifteen minutes of  tedium as to knowing obviously where the movie is heading, i.e. that the three character subplots who are in three different countries will magically come together at the end and live happily ever after. End of story - except, of course, the hereafter.    Incorrect portrayals:  (a.) Portraying science quotes:  \\"scientists minds are closed to such things as hereafter myths\\"; \\"evidence is irrefutable\\"; \\"others that disagree are enemies\\". First, scientists welcome all possibilities -  witness quantum, chaos, singularities and GUTs. Second, nothing is irrefutable in scientific process - everything is refutable. Third, disagreement is welcome. That is part of the process of how science advances. No one has an investment in being right, just in advancing the discussion.   (b.) The hereafter is shown as little statue people surrounded by a light is portrayed as real because \\"when unconscious no fresh images can be produced\\"; \\"there is no sense of time/space and you feel weightless\\". All are offered as proof of a hereafter. WRONG! Whether dead or unconscious the brain continues to function with cellular stores of oxygen and glucose for minute(s) and as they are depleted the normal white light effect becomes tunneled. Not surprisingly the one image you want to create when dying is someone important to you. The other evidences are normal for anyone who has ever had night time dreams.     Producer bias:  It is not coincidental that Eastwood would make such a movie because there is nothing more desirable for a person approaching the end to not want it to end. Even more so if your life has been an accumulation of idolatry and materialism. The more you have the harder it is to lose it.  Preserving and passing on wealth to your descendants has been common fare for thousands of years - Egyptians!. It's just an additional pathway to immortality.  Sorry Clint - it just ends.
1577314808|4.0|Overall, It is a good book. I like the message of this book. But here is my only critique: As I was reading the book, the author constantly kept reminding me of the historic figures such as the Buddha and Jesus, who obviously are figures in the collective human past.     There is no doubt that past and future are illusory and Now is real. It is made very clear in \\" the Power of Now.\\" Many people know this basic Truth. But they continue to live in the past and future. Why? For years I have been asking this and many similar questions.For example, why humans have such a busy mind? Why are humans so divided? Why are humans so fearful, anxious, angry, hateful, jealous, greedy, egocentric, self-righteous, and insecure, despite the arrival of so many great religious, social and political philosophies? Can technology solve human problems or does it create them? What is the basis of human psyche and human nature? Can it be changed? Can stress be transmitted thru genes?      In my long pursuit of these questions, for the first time, I have finally found real, original, and logical answers in a newly released book, \\" Stress Cure Now\\" by Dr. Sarfraz Zaidi. And my search has come to an end. Truth is so obvious.
B000JIHP88|5.0|The Rainforest Mobile was a gift to us and our LO loves it. I put it up when she was a few weeks old, and before I knew it she was completely entertained and would even fall asleep to it. She is now 8 months old and we still haven't had to change the batteries yet with every day use (several times a day).    I wonder about the people who say it isn't loud enough, because sometimes I wish it had a lower setting and feel that sometimes it is too loud. The light is just enough to illuminate her crib (guess I'm also not understanding the people that say the night light isn't bright enough, turn on a lamp if you need more light).     I especially love the remote. Never thought it would come in handy but it really does.
B00454U1NS|5.0|All the best all rolled into one.  Pink is at her best for sure.  Please be aware this CD is the uncut, unsensored version of her songs.  Rock on!!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Tarantino's best days are far behind him with reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He hasn't made anything I like since. He needs to stay out of the horror genre, the crouching tiger genre and whatever you call this latest moronic blitzkrieg of talentless crap.<br /><br />If Tarantino's point was to \\"kill Hitler\\", then he didn't do it well enough. There should've been more emphasis on his death than just a few bullets in the face. After forcing my eyes open throughout the endless dialogue, the mindless action builds toward the end and just about everyone dies in this movie... so there's nothing I took away from it except the thought - why did I buy this piece of crap?
1401225756|1.0|The author dwells in a world of silly feelings that a healthy individual will not be able to relate to. This whole series is nothing but immaturity disguised as intellectual deep stuff. Stay away from it.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|If you're an Eva fan, you don't want to miss this one. Check out a different review for a plot synopsis.    The packaging is really nice, the orange slipcover opens up to reveal Unit 02 and it has a very nice texture. However, the slipcover edges are prone to chipping, so handle with care.    As for the film itself, the Blu-ray picture and audio quality is on par with 1.11, so it's a real treat for the eyes and ears.    It's up to personal taste, but if you like English dubs, chances are you won't be disappointed by this one. There are a few creative liberties taken, but they help to enhance the dub experience. The actors are in top form, especially the main returning cast, which says a lot because I never liked the dub of the original show.    The majority of the extras in this set are nice, but the 2.22 trailers and TV spots really aren't all that interesting and seem like they were added for the extra bulk. The 2.02 featurette is pretty neat and the for deleted scenes are definitely worth a look. The commentary track bored me to death, but I'm really not a fan of commentaries to begin with, so if you are, you might find something there.    All in all, this is a near-perfect release of a really awesome movie, so do yourself a favor and buy it.
B004NOH9LW|1.0|Seriously?  I kept on waiting for this movie to pick up.  But it never did.  Poor Matt Damon.  He did some great acting.  Whenever the long, drawn out pans stopped. Was this an art film or something?  It was sooooooo bad.  I always thought Clint could do no wrong.      What happened with the cute redhead?  Yeah, I get it.  But seriously?    \\"I'm not looking out for you anymore, marcus\\" Really?!?!  So - a dead 10 year old is a kermudgeony old man?    I missed going out to watch LIMITLESS to stay in and watch this.  Ill never get the two hours back.
1439107955|5.0|I cannot remember having read a book that has left me so emotionally exhausted as this.  It wasn't an easy read because the subject matter is not an easy one for a lay person -- though I suppose it isn't all that easy for a medical practitioner either.  An uneasy read it may have been but I found that I couldn't put it down.  And now that I have read it through to the end I am completely drained.  Some writing makes me laugh out loud; other pieces drive me to anger or frustration expressed audibly.  The Emperor of All Maladies is the only one I can remember in recent years that has brought me to tears aloud.    I can't pretend that I have understood or can remember all the science, all the treatments or the names of all the many people who appear in the book but the general message transmitted have been absorbed -- the flashes of brilliance among the scientists, the stubbornness of many of the medical practitioners, and so forth.  But it is Dr. Mukherjee's ability to remind his readers, sometimes at the most unexpected moments, that the story is a human story and that there are real people out there.  This is what makes this book so remarkable.  You are reading about scientists stuck in ruts and then someone has a spark of genius that ignites others or about surgeons and physicians locked into this procedure or that treatment regime -- and then suddenly a real human story is presented, usually no more than a page or two but enough to stop you dead in your tracks and realize that this isn't labs and hospitals but ordinary people.    This biography of an ever-changing disease is SO well written, SO readable, that in addition to its intrinsic interest it should stand an exemplar to other authors on how to convey ideas and knowledge on a difficult topic to a lay reradership.    This a highly engaging and extremely enlightening read. It is simply a wonderful book.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We are in our fifties and decided to order the game based on the ratings.  Easy to learn, fast to play, no excessive brain power required.  We have invited friends over to play and have also given it as a gift.  If you like Chinese checkers, you will like this game.  You simply can't go wrong buying it.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I've been infatuated with Robin Hood since the Disney days (and I don't mean the cartoon) and Errol Flynn.  While I know that Ridley Scott took liberties with history, I'm not bothered by it.  Let go of historical accuracies, if there can be such a thing in a fable, and forget all past versions.  This is an incomparable story of knighthood, chivalry, and romance.  Robin has never looked better; Marion is a feminist gem.  The settings are gorgeous; the music is sublime. What's not to love?
1401309666|4.0|The \\"Long Tail\\" by Chris Anderson began as an article in Wired magazine in 2004.  Anderson then expanded the ideas in his article into his book, which became a New York Times bestseller.          Anderson's theory of the long tail can be summarized as this:  Our current culture and economy are both increasingly shifting away from focusing on a relatively small number of hits (mainstream products, markets, songs, movies, etc) at the \\"head \\"of the demand curve.  Instead, we are moving toward a huge number of niches found in the tail of the curve.  Additionally, in this era without the constraints of physical shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution, these \\"niche\\" type goods can be as economically attractive as the \\"hits\\" of mainstream fare.   However, simply offering as much choice as possible is not enough.  Anderson explains that in order for these \\"niche\\" items to be successful, and for the phenomenon of the \\"long tail\\" to work, there must be a significant demand for this new supply.  If not, the \\"long tail\\" will wither.  Anderson explains that this is due to the fact that the tail is not only measured by the \\"amount of variety available\\", but also the \\"number of people who gravitate towards these numerous choices\\".  As Anderson explains numerous times in this book, \\"the true shape of demand is revealed only when consumers are offered infinite choice.\\"   The section of the book that I particularly enjoyed was when Anderson explained the importance of \\"filters\\".  With so much choice now available over the web through services such as iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon, it can potentially be a challenge for a consumer something that satisfies their demand.  Anderson explains that the role of filters in today's long tail markets is shifting from \\"gatekeeper\\" to \\"advisor\\".  Instead of trying to predict tastes of the consumer, filters such as Google are measuring it.  Filters such as Netflix's customer recommendations help consumers reveal their likes and dislikes through their behavior.  Filters help create markets for things that are already available by stimulating demand for them.  While reading this section I couldn't help but think how much I rely on filters in today's world.  If there is a particular item that I want, I used massive filters such as Google to search for it.  Without filters, I do not feel that \\"long tail markets' could exist, because it would be too hard for the consumer to find the niche markets they are looking for.   Overall, I enjoyed the concept of this book.  I found it to be particularly relevant to today's marketplace and would recommend this to MBA students.  The only criticism I have of this book would be it could have been a little more concise.  I felt that Anderson repeated many of his points numerous times throughout the book.  However, I felt that many of these points were ahead of their time since they are still relevant 5 years after the book was originally published.  This impressed me since technology and the way we communicate has dramatically changed in that time period, which has further increased the \\"length of the tail\\".
1604443499|1.0|The book is, of course, a classic.  But the published edition sent to me by the seller was absolutely terrible. It must have been printed by a child under 12, or a person who could barely read English. Numerous spelling errors just about every page, truncated sentences, and all in all barely readable at points.  I will never order from this seller again - I feel ripped off.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|There's a reason why Glenn Hughes is referred to as the voice of rock and this disc once again shows us why. As a lifelong guitarist myself, Joe Bonamassa shreds with intensity and delight. The opening track comes out with a force to be reckoned with. An all-star cast with Bonham and Sherinian. I cannot wait to hear their next outing and this is what rock n roll is all about. Raw, intense, and soul stirring. Thanks guys for rocking the way it should be done. Buy this cd, you won't be disappointed and if you are, you just don't like good ol' raw rock n roll...
0060765380|5.0|From beginning to end this book was filled with adventure and left you wanting more after every page.  It was set up perfectly with the tale of Marco Polo.  James Rollins creates a wide variety of and numerous characters and does a great job of bringing them all to life.  More importantly he keeps each one relevant and connects everyone to the same story in their own way.    Having never read James Rollins before, my only regret was not starting from book #1 of the Sigma Force Novels.  I enjoyed this read so much that I bought the rest in the series (all from Amazon of course for an amazing deal) and can't wait to start from the beginning of this series.    Whether your reading about the hijacked cruise ship, following the team deep into the jungle, or exploring through ancient ruins, The Judas Strain will make you want to become part of the story.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Unstoppable turned out to be an unexpectedly engaging movie.  The ever consistent Denzel Washington plays the veteran but helpful taskmaster to a perfectly cast Chris Pine.  Pine blends a slightly arrogant streak with the realization that he can learn a lot from the cagey veteran.  The film incorporates the \\"up yours\\" attitude towards management that audiences will relate to.  Rosario Dawson plays the part of the go-between between management and labor perfectly.   The sustained \\"action\\" of the train is surprisingly well-maintained throughout the movie.  Kudos to Tony Scott, the director, for another well directed movie and to the editors.  I saw this movie in the theatre and bought it for my wife because I thought she would like this action movie...and she does.  I recommend it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I watched the entire season beginning to end in one night.  It is more than just a vampire drama.  It contains shape shifters, ancient gods, telepaths, and more.  It is sexy and fun to watch.  It leaves you with a cliff hanger at the end of each episode, enticing you to watch the next episode.  I highly recommend this show to fans of romance, vampires, supernatural, or murder mysteries.
0345505387|3.0|Our absolute most favorite author, but our least favorite of her output. Too hard to distinguish one male from another, with this illustration style. Not too sure we could have followed the story line, if we weren't already aware of it, as it seemed a bit short and \\"choppy\\". Others - younger than our age - would possibly like the style. That said, we bought an extra copy as a surprise gift for the friend who first turned us on to Diana. It will be interesting to hear her opinion of this. Comic books are no longer our thing, but we are eagerly awaiting the next \\"Outlander\\" adventure. Also, nothing ventured, nothing gained - we admire the attempt! And, we both think that \\"unknowns\\" would probably be the best choices for any movie versions.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Have to say i enjoyed this movie for it's true to life story line.  The casting was excellent as well.
B004OZZ624|4.0|This was a good movie. Don't feel like going into detail, but wanted to chime in. It was good. It's Russell Crowe so...you don't expect anything less than good.
1574216988|5.0|Sandy's book is rich with wonderful tangles, easy to follow instructions as well as beautifully presented. She includes great examples of her own work and interesting ideas to inspire your own creations.  I am a CZT and recommend this book to all of my students.  For avid Zentanglers this is a must have!  This book is a bit more advanced so for beginners I would say the \\"Totally Tangled\\" book is the place to start. That is also a fabulous book with lots of tangles and examples of where patterns come from and where to look. Sandy is not only a talented artist she is a fantastic author/teacher.  Definitely buy this book!  Wendy, Westford MA
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Oh man, I loved this cartoon! Steve Carrell was perfect for the role of Gru, and the dialog was funny, and the storyline was nice.  Basically reminds you why you ever fell in love with cartoons.  Kind of similar to Megamind.  Definitely recopmmend as a rental, for both kids and adults.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|this movie is with out a doubt the greatest war film i had ever seen:). it was intense,action-packed from start to  its epic final. screw the critics this film was what id4 should have been. lead by a great cast, decent amount of drama and honor/ bravery to the end. I give thise a 9 out of 10 stars this movie is kickass  hoo raa:)
1600595871|4.0|Only got this book a week or two ago but was surprised at how much it covers. As the title suggests, it is quite a heavy volumn and contains a lot of very helpful and clear instructions - the illustrations are very good too. Many of the types of bindings are shown with other artists work as examples.  If you're just starting out with this fascinating hobby then this is the ideal book.
0811870413|5.0|Really for KTdid who is the bread baker in the family, but doesn't have a separate account and therefore pens  this under my name:  This is a book that shows you how to make your own style of bread.  You custom it to your lifestyle, kitchen and climate.  Love using the Lodge Combo Cooker.  Lame your own bread designs into the loaf before baking.  This is a book about bread and the love of it.  It is a book to have for those who see bread as the  staff of life.  Chad Robertson loves bread and it is a great book...it sets you on your own baking path.  Like Ed Wood on Sourdough and Emily Buehler on Bread Science, this book took me to a new level.  I have a sourdough starter which I have nurtured for over 35 years. Baked all my own bread.  Was introduced to him by an article and bread recipe I tried in  Food & Wine.  It intrigued me.  Did not see this coming until I got his book. Crust.  Open Crumb.  Stretching and Folding, not kneading.  It is \\"kind of like living with your bread.\\"  For those who want a faster way of making bread, there are more than enough books and gadgets out their to satisfy you.  This is not a fast-bread book.  It is a book about a journey to make breads that have your signature and imprint upon them.  It takes a deep dive into a world I thought I understood.  It brought me a wonderful realization that I was just now beginning and learning anew.  Breads with a texture, chew, taste and crust that had eluded me...I have come closer to making that  bread than I had ever thought I would get.  A terrific book for those who understand the joy of tearing, not just slicing, a piece of their bread and pushing it onto the plate.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions.  This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period!  This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original.  As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment!  From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \\"Tommy\\" by the Who and \\"White\\" album as it's called by the Beatles.<br /><br />Although never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \\"British Invasion\\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc.  This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \\"statement\\" album.  The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving.  The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.<br /><br />Barry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon/McCartney or Townshend/Entwhistle and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be.  The epic title track shows their strong ability to \\"story tell\\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean.  Then you have songs with a country fell such as \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" to the folk sounding \\"Melody Fair\\" to the bouncy \\"Suddenly\\" amongst others.  Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.<br /><br />This album really showed that the \\"boys\\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19.  Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him.  Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers.  That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" reveals the struggle of one man to bring slavery to an end.  It is beautifully filmed and historically correct.  The acting is good, the story is exciting and it shows the power of determination in spite of political and financial pitfalls endured.  Slavery was a stain on our history and we still feel the negative effects in the mindless prejudice around us.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|Everything on this CD is good, after a few times listening to it, it has become one of my favorites CD's.  I hope there is another one coming out soon.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This was an amazing written peice of work and thought out intricatly.  The actors very well done!!! I really didn't realize I would be crying when he saw his children at the end but I did!  For the neigh sayers I don't think you have been part of writing or the acting before because it was completly not what I expected it to be in its complexity and creation by the writers the technical aspect and actors!
B0041VB8BO|5.0|Nate Ruess from The Format has such a unique voice.  It always sounds like he's just about to cry or scream, but he has such joyous passion in his voice and the music is so happy, that you can't imagine why he would be sad.  But there is a layer of melancholy that pervades, that makes his joyful tirades beautiful and, yes, fun!  I would recommend getting the Deluxe version , if only just for the song \\"Stitch Me Up\\" and a great slowed up remix on \\"Walking The Dog II\\".  The songs are orchestrated ferris wheel tales of hopeful woe.  This is the album I would've wanted The Format to come out with after [[ASIN:B000FVBLGQ Dog Problems]]!  It's a great complement to The Format catalogue, and a great direction for Nate Ruess.
B003UESJFG|5.0|With a family of 5, being able to see movies when they're first released is not in our budget.  With Amazon offering a discount for pre-ordering to be released movies, or even buying them already released our family saves money.  We received a Blu-ray player from my parents for Christmas 2 years ago, but our girls still have their portable DVD players (bought by my in-laws) and a DVD player in our van.  I love that the movies come out with the multiple copies so those that are not fortunate enough to receive upgraded electronics are not forced to buy them or miss out.
B004GHYCKW|3.0|PJ Harvey's 'Let England Shake' has been recently released to overwhelming critical acclaim but to my mind it is not a great album. It's easy enough on the ear. Too easy in fact. There's some Bj&ouml;rk, some U2 (from the Joshua Tree days) and just a snuf of good old angry PJ. The poppyness, however, jars with the solemn overall theme for this album: war. She sings about how England has been haunted by the spectre of the bloody Gallipolli debacle. But the lyrics are none too subtle ('big guns shooting', 'orphaned children', 'limbs pointing upwards' ...). And they miss the biting irony that another war-obsessed brings to the theme. In Roger Waters' 'The Wall', 'The Final Cut' and 'Amused to Death', the pain and waste of war, and also its paradoxical, perverse beauty are brought into relief much more poignantly. PJ's musings on the whole leave me pretty cold. They are pedestrian, derivative and occasionally veer into unpalatable bombast (one might say that of Waters as well, of course). And yet she has shown in the past, with albums such as 'To Bring You My Love', 'Is This Desire' and 'White Chalk' that she is able to conjure visions of epic, biblical anger and mystery. Here it didn't happen. There are two or three songs which have the fingerprints of a PJ in great form. 'The Last Living Rose' is short but refreshingly direct and unadorned. Despite the simplicity it encapsulates a complex mix of emotions. It's likely the best of the whole album. I also like 'Bitter Branches', which is a fairly unpretentious rock song that goes straight to the quick. 'England' has those Bj&ouml;rk overtones, with PJ singing in that unnaturally high tessitura and weird accent, but it sort of works. Not a 'beautiful' song but one that certainly bears repeated listening. 'Battleship Hill' starts chillingly awful - I first thought it was a splash of Enya - but then the song unfolds beautifully, with very effective layered vocals. 'The Glorious Land' comes quite close to being memorable but I'm really unsettled by that gimmicky bugled theme. Also PJ intoning that campy 'Oh America' is a real downer here. There is a lot where my attention starts to drift and a few things that really make me grab for the remote. The final song is one of them: a monotonous, incongruous children song that speaks about an ex-soldier that can't get his friend dying on the battlefield out of his mind. Listen to 'The Ballad of Bill Hubbard' on Waters' Amused to Death and you know what I mean.lly unsettled by that gimmicky bugled theme. Also PJ intoning that campy 'Oh America' is a real downer here.

B004EPYZPI|5.0|\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Mickey Haller is a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back of his Lincoln sedan. Haller has spent most of his career defending garden-variety criminals, until he lands the case of his career: defending Louis Roulet, a Beverly Hills playboy accused of rape and attempted murder. But the seemingly straightforward case suddenly develops into a deadly game of survival for Haller.    The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (excellent as Mickey Haller) is excellent.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have enjoyed this series so much.  Ms. Moning led us on a gripping fantastic journey of fantasy & mystery, love & angst. This is a keeper.  I bought this last book in audiobook version, and the two readers are amazing.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Gotta hand it to these guys, they have given me a lot of joy over the years and Mark Farner is one of the reasons I began to plat guitar. While I prefer the \\"rough and hungry\\" Grand Funk, this LP is a documentation of an experienced and well polished band. Something we became accustomed to later on in the 1980's. Grand Funk was already in on the ground floor of what was next to come. Listening to bands like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, I can hear the influence of early Grand Funk. As a true Grand Funk Fan, I can appreciate the conglomeration of styles, career phases and tributes to their roots and influences that make up this LP. This is all wrapped up into a documentation of what Grand Funk does best...perform live! There are those that will complain that the band sounds \\"too polished\\" or \\"it ain't Grand Funk because they sold out commercially\\". Bunk. There were those that said the same things about the Beatles when they strayed from the \\"Mersey Sound\\" and started to experiment. You can't tell me that Abbey Road is not a polished production, and it remains one of the Beatles greatest gems. Grand Funk also did not remain the same, as they grew in form and experience. This LP is a landmark for GFR.
1591843790|5.0|by D Warner (under spouse account)  Disclosure (pg 30) Guy and I play on the same hockey team. He is the only player that I have seen take a ricocheted pass off a low ceiling and fire the puck into the net. (pg20) We share the same passion, hockey, and I have no intention to pitch him on a new business venture.    Guy has taken the principles of being a good human being and applied them to the social and business world. Everyone can be a baker! (pg33)    Three age groups will have similar thoughts about this book. But these three age groups will also see, experience, take away and use the material differently.    Age 18-30....  \\"Enchantment\\" is a must read for this group. This is your time. Guy talks about all the wonderful things that the digital age has presented. Chapters eight and nine detail on how to use the push and pull technology. \\"Enchantment\\" is the blueprint to start your career.    Age 30-50....Time to review your life path? Tweak the career? \\"Enchantment\\" will do it!    Age 50+.....Growing up in this age group, there was no book like \\"Enchantment\\" to read. There was only trial and error, hopefully less in the error part, particularity the catastrophic ones. There was no global technology, no Macs, no Windows 95, no tweets, no emails. It's a wonder we survived! As you read Guy's words and if you fit into this age group, there will be a great deal of \\"aha moments\\". They will either be \\"that's how I did it? revelation\\" or \\"I should have done it that way\\".    No matter your age, gender, social or economic background, reading \\"Enchantment\\" is just that, enchanting! Thanks Guy for letting me hold the Kawasaki Swallowtail, I'll pass you the puck again!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|which is a good thing. The actors hit their spots and this feels great. All characters are less than perfect. Some are evil. Real lawyers can say it feels real. Can't ask for more from a movie like this. Good actors in even the small parts, which is a testament to their belief in the movie. Liked it a lot.
1439102724|3.0|To say that I love Jodi Picoult's books would be an understatement. Before I got my Kindle, I had purchased all of her books after reading 19 Minutes. I went online and ordered everyone of her other books. I thought her last book \\"House Rules\\" was the best thus far and was so excited to get this new one.  I was so disappointed. I enjoy that she tackles controversial issues and usually does them with such research and seems to know exactly what she is talking about. The characters are always so real and appealing. I wanted to love them or hate them.  I did not like the characters in Sing You Home. They weren't real. There interactions were strained and sometimes unbelievable. I like that I can usually predict her books and how they will end. Yes, there are always twists and turns, but she is still predictable. This book was too predictable. Once I sensed how it was going to end, I really lost interest. I like Zoe's mother...her quirkiness was definitely a comic relief in what I felt was a boring read. The characters were stereotyped. I didn't like how the book ended without telling us what happened to Lucy. I do look forward to her next book and I will buy it, but every once in a while she just misses the mark and to me, this was one of those times.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|I've admired this band since leaving home for military service in the mid 80's.  It took my independence to find an independent band who seemed to blaze their own trail, not being swayed by what others were doing.  That's an honest band.    I bought this release by listening to the samples here.  There's something to be said when you hear a good 4 or 5 songs in those samples.  REM can be very proud of Uberlin, It Happened Today, Walk it Back along with Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I.  Oh, and if Oh My Heart doesn't pull at your strings a little bit, you might want to check yourself for a pulse.    Regardless of REM's advanced career, they can be extremely proud of this release and people like myself thank you guys very much for it.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|The four stars are actually because of the bonus material.  Three Jean Valjean singing \\"Bring Him Home\\" including Colm Wilkinson was a thrill to see. The original London cast performing \\"One Day More\\" was spectacular.  If only the rest of the concert was that thrilling and exciting.  For some reason, the perfomrances just seemed good, but not great.  Let's face it, any performance of Les Miserables cannot be terrible because of the wonderful score.  However, there are some recordings and concerts that are better than others.  After watching hte original London Cast perform \\"One Day More\\", I would have rather have seen them perform the concert.  The 10th Anniversary Concert cast was far better.  Even Lea, the original Kim from Miss Saigon, was better 15 years ago as Eponine than she was as Fantine.  Ncik Jonas gave the best performance he could as Marius, but no one can do it better than Michael Ball.  Jenny Galloway appeared in both the 10th and 25th concert, but she seemed far better and more enthusiastic in the 10th concert.  So, while this was very entertaining, the 10th anniversary concert was better in terms of casting and performance.  The one thing I like about this concert is the camera angles, closeups, and shots.  But, get the 10th Anniversary concert instead.
055357342X|5.0|I am throughly enjoying this series of books. They are thrilling and original. I had not hoped to like them so much. I am addicted to them, and I can't put them down. I am 36 and I have to say they are not books for just teens or a younger crowd. I am loving them. I haven't read anything as good in ages (save for The Wheel of Time series and a few others).
B000002IO1|5.0|This CD brings back very fond memories. When this was popular back during 1990. I remember listening to \\"Black Velvet\\" played, while I watched, Dancing Girls, dance at a club down in Mobile, Alabama, during Mardi Gras. Mobile celebrates Mardi Gras just like New Orleans does. The song \\"Black Velvet\\", was played over & over again, and the girls, loved to dance to it, plus it was a crowd favorite. \\"Black Velvet\\" is as pure of a \\"Southern Rock\\" song as they come. It mentions \\"Mississippi in the Middle of a Dry Spell, White Lighting Bound to Drive You Wild\\". Also, it mentions Jimmy Rodgers, the legendary roots music man, from Meridian, Mississippi. And also, it mentions \\"Love Me Tender, Keeps them Crying for Hours\\", and it also includes other \\"Southern\\" themes & lyrics. I like the part with the lyrics \\"Black Velvet in that little boy's eyes, Black Velvet if you please\\". I felt like that \\"little boy\\", while I was watching the girls dance & \\"strut their stuff\\" It is one \\"Awesome\\" Song. It will always be special to me. The rest of the album \\"Rocks\\" also. I know Alannah is not a native \\"Southerner\\", but she sure sings like one, on this great CD.    This CD is still just as great now, as it was back then, and I highly recommend this one, \\"If you please\\". Thanks!!!!

B003NWS5AO|3.0|But the initial reaction is -  Five Stars? Really? Silver Rider and Monkey sound great. The country songs would have made more impact with Alison Krauss duetting. Other songs sound more like Mighty Rearranger. Nothing terribly original going on here. Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell have been doing this kind of music for years.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I love everything Brandon does, but this... this is different. This book is probably his best work, and when I finished it, it easily took its place among my all-time favorites. It's interesting, with a great plot, good dialogue, a majestic world full of amazing lore, and excellent characters and backstories. This book deserves every 5-star review it gets, and the series in itself is fast on its way to be the next Wheel of Time. I look forwards to reading the novels of The Stormlight Archive over the next decade, and will eagerly await their release each time.

0596007124|5.0|I bought this book after using the Head First Java book.  It follows the same style of the previous book.<br />This book does what it promises.  Using humor, wit, and a friendly writing style, the authors implant the most useful design patterns in your brain.  The code examples are relevant and fun to do, as are the exercises.  I noticed one negative reviewer stated that the codes in the book were not functional.  He apparently did not read the \\"Read Me\\" section of the book which clearly states that the examples are tailored to focus your attention on key points.  The authors clearly indicate in the example code which parts were left out by inserting comment lines for the missing code.  I found the exercise of actually writing the missing code a great aid to learning, which is what these books are all about.  This is not a reference book.  It is a learning guide.  The book uses repetition to drive the points home, but not in a boring over-and-over-the-same-thing manner.  They do an excellent job of presenting the information from several different angles and reviewing previous material in a new application. If all you want is a compilation of patterns, look for a pattern catalog.  If you want to UNDERSTAND and apply patterns, grab this book.
031261246X|5.0|As a long-time Windows sysadmin and cyber security professional, I have been following Mark Russinovich's endeavors for quite a while.  When I learned he was writing a novel, I was very interested in its result.  I purchased this book about a week ago for my Kindle, and I had a very hard time putting it down.  Mark does a great job with Zero Day of accurately portraying the issues plaguing the information security industry today, all the while using literary freedom to thrill the reader in to an idea of a potential post-apocalyptic stone age, brought about through the mass distribution of malware (i.e viruses, trojans, worms, etc) by technical jihadists.  Some of the disparate manufacturing and industrial infections were a little harder to believe, but in a world of Stuxnet worms and Project Aurora breaches, the once thought,  purely fictitious scenarios, are becoming true.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and look forward to the possibility of Mark writing another novel.  Give this great story a chance folks, you will not be disappointed!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I've seen this once in the theatres, and 4-5 times from friends' copies.  I figured it was time to own a hardcopy myself.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the movie.  The characters other than Ellen Paige are believable.  All of the actors do a good job, including EP.  99% of the effects are very well done, with only the exception of 2 falling scenes in level 4.  The motivations are well thought out.  The movie itself is emotional, and ultimately, as with all good sci fi, the science is there purely as a way to look into human nature.  This aspect of the movie is very good.<br /><br />As for this package, it is a good design.  It's the Blu-Ray disk, the DV Disk, and a coupon inside for an MP4 or WMV format digital download.  Also, Amazon gives you a Digital Download 48-Hour Rental you can use if you have to see the movie before it shows up in the mail.  The packaging is compact and well designed.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|If you travel and ever throw your Voyager in your briefcase, get this case. I had a Voyager Pro and it took a beating in my briefcase. I just bought a Voyager Pro Plus and decided to protect it better. Worth the $11.

B001OQCV2O|5.0|When I finally decided to give this movie a chance last night, I was blown away.  First, know that yours truly does NOT believe in the 2012 theory.  In my opinion, December 21, 2012 will be here and it'll be a normal day.  Then we'll roll into December 22nd and everything will STILL be okay.  In my opinion, our world will end soon... just not in this generation and/or lifetime.  But, I digress.<br /><br />Putting the science and theories aside, this movie is superbly entertaining.  There isn't much to the story, basically the story of multiple people--including an author and his family, a newly-appointed Geologist, and leaders of government--as they brace for the impending disaster.  What follows is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride with a surprising amount of good ideas.  As the disaster is happening, the author must help guide his family to safety.  There, friendships are made and then broken, trust is betrayed, and hearts are put to the test.  However, the movie has one strong underlying theme--that is, the theme of hope and perseverance, no matter the struggle.<br /><br />However, the movie suffers in one common way between all of these disaster movies:  Once the epic, in-the-previews disaster moments happen, the movies does its best to stall... instead, it goes in circles for a little bit, but once it picks up again the circling stops.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, is it just me or does John Cusack wear the same sunglasses in every movie?<br /><br />Anyway, if you're not too sure about this movie or you're just in the mood for some mindless action, 2012 is the way to go.  At least rent it or borrow from a friend first--then, if you're like me and loved it, get it on Blu-ray.  Your HDTV will thank you.
B000067IZ3|1.0|I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and hated it.  It jumps around and did nothing but confuse me.
0060775858|3.0|It is so bad that I periodically hide it from my son so that I am not forced to endure it.  When he finds it, I sometimes make up my own words to amuse myself and my husband.  Boring pictures, no story line, poorly written text (ex. rhyming moon with moon...the author couldn't come up with anything else?).  I dread seeing my son coming towards me with this book.      That being said, the tot loves this book.  I take no credit for his bad taste.  However, since it is HIS book, it gets 3 stars to reflect our combined feelings about this piece of literature.
B00275EGWY|3.0|From an average housewife's point of view, the movie was just ok for me.  I appreciate the fact that it wasn't as gory as Full Metal Jacket or Black Hawk Down and it had some tender moments and a decent storyline.  I can't even think of anything special to write about it.  I certainly don't think it deserved picture of the year...
0698116496|4.0|This is a great book for children who can't read yet, but want to.  An amusing story line, even without many words.  This is one of my son's go-to books, and he gets a different version of the story every night.  There is plenty of stuff going on in the pictures to discuss and add to the story each time.    The only down side is that some nights I'm so tired I just want to read the night time books on auto-pilot because I'm wiped out.  This isn't a book that you can read while thinking about the grocery list.  But you probably shouldn't be doing that anyway...
B000M341QE|1.0|I got this movie for free when I bought my DVD player and finally sat down to watch it.  My husband and I turned it off after about 20 minutes because the language was so horrible.  I am not kidding when I say that every other word in this movie is the f word.  I have watched so many movies without foul language and they can be just as powerful and entertaining to watch as the the movies with foul language.  So why ruin a good story with this language?  I wish Hollywood would realize that not everyone speaks this way and that it is offensive.
B003Y5H55Q|4.0|If you liked Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz but were hoping for a little less of the British influence, Paul is your movie. It may not be as consistently funny as those two and it does start off rather slow, but there are some big laughs to be had along the way. The story is about two nerds from England who are visiting all the UFO hot spots in America. They happen to encounter a real alien who not only loves to curse, but is being hunted down by the very government he has spent the last 60 plus years helping. It's up to these two chaps to get him to his ship and on his way home.<br /><br />Our favorite best buds are back and the chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost remains intact. Seth Rogen was the perfect voice choice for the rude and crude alien, Paul, and the CGI brought the character to life so much that I forgot he wasn't a real living being. Paul has a filthy mouth, gets stoned, walks around naked, but becomes more endearing with each passing minute. He's like E.T.'s crazy uncle. There are also a number of big stars in small roles, Sigourney Weaver being one of them, and tons of references to Sci-Fi films of the past.<br /><br />If an alien race happens to find our planet and they are anything like Paul, well...let the invasion begin.
B000002ITW|5.0|I first heard this album on its release 40 years ago and I still feel that it is one of the very best live albums by any band. I don't want to spend time analyzing tracks as many reviewers have already done that but I just want to say that for those who may not have heard this album, the guitar dual between Neil Young and Stephen Stills on Southern Man is probably the greatest I have ever heard. I still believe that this version of Southern Man is the greatest live track I have ever heard. Play it loud and let Stephen Stills on the left and Neil Young on the right transport you to rock nirvana. Southern Man here is CSNY kicking serious a$$ and it is simply wonderful.
B000GCFD72|2.0|The content of this book is phenomenal.  It's profound and obvious at the same time.  But this translation to ebook format for the Kindle is insulting and lazy.  This book is filled with citations and references, as any book of this nature should be (but often isn't).  Unfortunately, all of these occur in the form of endnotes rather than footnotes.  That's not so bad in the print version, since it's easy enough to just flip back and forth between the text and the notes, but in the Kindle version the notes are more or less inaccessible.<br /><br />The irony here is that the Kindle version should SOLVE the inconvenience of endnotes, not exacerbate it.  The Kindle allows for hyperlinking.  I should be able to just tap the notation number to jump to the associated note and then tap a \\"back to text\\" link to go back to where I was.  This is how most publishers handle endnotes.  Obviously Amazon designed the software publishers use to convert their books to Kindle format in such a way that hyperlinking is easy.  In fact, Atria provides a hyperlinked table of contents, so they clearly know how it works.<br /><br />Especially for such a successful title, it is mind boggling that such a corner would be cut.  It would take one person less than a day to hyperlink every single note in this book.<br /><br />If an updated version including hyperlinks is released, I would update my review to five stars.  Until then I recommend not buying it, or buying the print version.  As-is, the Kindle version is extremely frustrating.

0439023521|5.0|I can't review this without spoilers (because here at Kathryn's Book Nook, we believe in honesty and sharing our try feelings - no I don't have multiple personality disorder). Anyway, a short preview before I spoiler (don't worry, there will be a warning).<br /><br />To start off with, I felt intense apprehension about reading this book. Everyone I talked to who read it said that they loved it. People who didn't love Young Adult or Science Fiction loved this book. Now, I don't really know why this worried me - if anything it should have reassured me that I would love this book - but I just couldn't force myself to read it. I would pick it up in the book store to go to read it and I couldn't. It isn't that I am one of those people who can't read popular books, when I found out that Twilight was popular, I read it. The problem was that I just didn't think I could like this particular book. So two days ago, I picked up the book and started reading it (like a chore). I couldn't get into it... the first 12 pages were so boring. I had gotten that far before and then abandoned it. But I pushed through this time, and I am glad I did. All I can say is that if you haven't read this book, read it.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />/~/<br /><br />Okay, now lets get down to the nitty gritty feelings left because of the book... The first thing I want to address is Rue. I was devastated by her death. I cried (just a little bit) and I mourned her death. I know that it was inevitable, given the nature of the games, but I didn't think it would come so soon. I loved Rue. She reminds me of my younger sisters(when they were younger). I wanted to protect her from everything, including death. I love how her death was written, but I wanted more of her. I wanted there to be some way for her to be able to come out of it. Hearing that she was the oldest of six children only made her death more tragic.<br /><br />Next to talked about is the proverbial elephant in the room... Peeta. I love Peeta. I wasn't so sure of him at the beginning, but through Katniss' distrust, i actually came to trust him. I could see what she could not see from the very beginning, he meant it when he said he liked her. When she explained his looks at her through their school years, I knew that he liked her. My real frustration is with Katniss at the end of the novel. How could she do that? I thought that she had really grown to love him. Some of the things that she did and said only seemed to indicate how much she loved him. The fact that she said that if she was the one who lived she would never really leave the arena... the fact she risked her life to get the medicine at the feast... everything seemed to indicate that she loved him. And Gale, please, she had chance with him and she didn't take it. He has been in the friend zone too long. She shouldn't even be thinking about him in any way except \\"I can't wait to see my best friend again\\" way. My heart broke for Peeta as he was walking away from her on the platform of the train station. I hope that she gets her act together (and quickly) and realizes that he is the one for her~<br /><br />Perhaps that thing I can identify with the most is the love Katniss has for her younger sister, Primrose. I am the oldest of four girls and I know that I would do anything for my sisters. I would die for them, if that is what was called for. I try to picture myself in Katniss' shoes, when she hears her sisters name be called, and all I can think is that I would have done the exact same thing. In my case, it would have meant certain death (I have no outdoor skills at all) but I would have rather died then spend the rest of my life knowing that I could have saved my sister and I didn't. The protective love that an older sibling feels for a younger one is expertly portrayed here.<br /><br />I can't imaginewhat it must have been like to be the parents of any of these characters. To be forced to watch on television while your child gets hunted down and killed. I can't imagine what it must be like to want your child to win, even then realizing that means that they must murder someone else's child. You want your child home safely, but when you are celebrating their continued life, some other mother is crying over the death of their child.<br /><br />Another question I have is why did the guy from District 11 (I can't remember his name) take the bag belonging to District 2 and why didn't he kill the C guy (gosh I am forgetting names) while he had the chance? It seems to me, and I could be totally wrong about this, that he wanted to draw the guy from District 2 to fight him. He must have known that he would be the target for him after that. My theory, which is probably totally off-base, is that he didn't favor killing and that he had some feeling in his heart for Katniss. I am not saying that he had a crush or anything like that. But he seems to not really favor killing people. He didn't go for the goods in the beginning (obvious because he had no weapon except for the huge rock) and he hid out in the area that no one went into. He did kill Clover, but that seemed to be more because he was getting revenge for the death of little Rue, and even before he let Katniss go, he seemed to be hesitating about killing her. Others probably have far more accurate theories, but that is what I think.<br /><br />Now another thing I observed about these books is the food colors. Off the top of my head there is the purple melon and the blue grapes. that just seems odd to me. I don't really understand the point of changing the color of common things. Maybe that will come up in the next book.child gets hunted down and killed.

B00006LPER|5.0|She lives with her mother. It is an oppressive relationship. They sleep in the same bedroom. The mother is very suspicious of her behaviour; rummaging for evidence of things sexually illicit.  She is a piano teacher; a strict one and slightly bored. However, she plays beautifully. That is what inspires an already fine young player to seek her tuition, to elevate his skills further. He plays after her superb recital. She feigns indifference. The film proceeds with his pursuit of her tuition skills. What transpires between them becomes electrifying.  In one scene, she walks into a sex shop and is `eyed' with suspicion by men doing the same thing, as she waits for a viewing kiosk. She enjoys hard-core porn'. A man who does this is just that but a woman? Judgements abound! Why?  The film oscillates between these extremes; exquisite culture and hard-core interests. It is fascinating on both counts.

0439023491|5.0|If you haven't read THE HUNGER GAMES or CATCHING FIRE, do not read this review... insead go and read the book!<br /><br />Very rarely do we see books where the sequel is as good as the first book... the same is true with movies. However, CATCHING FIRE was just as good as the HUNGER GAMES. The series was amazing. I can't review it without spoilers, so I won't even try.<br /><br />I will just start by saying that I am Team Peeta... some of the time I don't even like Gale. Now, I understand that Gale is more of the type that some people go for, but I am a diehard romantic, and Petta's sacrificial love fore Katniss is so amazing, that I can't helping loving them. My personal theory is that Katniss wants to love Gale, because he represents freedom and he was there when she was going through a hard time, but in reality she actually loves Peeta. She just can't admit it because everything about her love for Petta started out from the Games, and that was/is a horrible memory. However, her reaction when she finds out that Petta was taken by the capital just shows me that she loves him, as well as when they both argued about who would live. I felt my heart squeeze when she said that she realized that she would she would be damaged forever if Petta were to die.<br /><br />But more about Petta later... Let's start with the games. I have to say that I was not expecting them to have to go back into the arena to have to fight other victors again. The Quarter Quells seem so harsh. I mean, obviously, anything surrounding the hunger games is harsh... I think one of the sad moments for me was when I found out about the death of Cecelia. It wouldn't have been bad if Suzanne Collins hadn't described the three children being pealed off of her when her name was called. I can't imagine being the president when all of the people of the Capital became distressed over the games.<br /><br />Speaking of the Quarter Quells, I bet the president didn't really think that one through all of the way (I believe that he made this reaping in an attempt to have Petta and Katniss killed). It might seem like a good idea for the immediate, but when you think about the fact that you are putting the people who started the rebelion (however unknowingly) in front of cameras again. What I don't understand is why Katniss never thought of keeping both her and Petta alive the whole game. She was so focussed on keeping Petta alive, but how long would the Capital have allowed her and Petta to stay alive by themselves. They would have sent in things to try to kill one of them..<br /><br />I loved the arena in this book. I thought that the idea of the clock was so ingenious! I wish that we had been told what all of the times had in store. Seeing Katniss and Finnick's anguish with the jatterjays was painful. I can't even imagine how insane I would go if I thought that someone was hurting my sisters. I couldn't bare to hear there screams of anguish and then think that someone was torturing them to get those sounds. It would all be too painful to be bourn. If I thought that someone was hurting my sisters in that way, I would probably want to die... or kill the person hurting them, which again makes me think that the Capital doesn't realize how counterproductive these games are.I believe that he made this reaping in an attempt to have Petta and Katniss killed).

0393078299|5.0|The practical success of quantum mechanics has enabled today's information-based economy in much the same way as the harnessing of steam did for the industrial revolution. The pioneers for both were few in number and whose long shadows were quickly covered by practitioners' incremental improvements accumulated to far reaching and long lasting impact on society's material culture. But quantum mechanics contains a paradox that is profoundly intellectual and with disturbing metaphysical aspects that are still not resolved to this day. This well written book details quantum mechanic's early history and background, from Max Plank's almost accidental discovery of an analytical method that explained what were then considered minor details in physics, including the birth of theoretical physics that coincided with the collapse of classical physic's explanation of the material universe as then understood, and, not least, the clash of two giants, Einstein and Bohr and their differing worldviews, as the paradox appeared and deepened when evolving analytical and manipulative skills became more powerful. Fast paced and much like a mystery with several levels of narrative. One of the most notable is the fact that the cast of characters and their work was extremely small, unknown and unheralded until Einstein became an international celebrity. Another is the power of imagination, long before science was spelled with a capital S, through the famous thought experiments made famous by Einstein, that brought understanding based on mathematical reasoning and without needing experimental proof. The players' egos, foibles, follies and insightful flashes also are part of the story, and how they sorted themselves into two camps reflecting the two opposing world views that provide the crux of the paradox. Einstein profoundly and deeply believed in the independent existence of the material universe, while Bohr held just as profoundly and deeply that there is no absolute reality beyond what can be conjured by observation. This highly readable book covers not just some physicists' quibbles, but the vista to our understanding of the universe as we comprehend it, from the unimaginably physically small realm of quantum mechanics to the seemingly limitless vastness of the cosmos.n be conjured by observation.

1400079144|4.0|I have had several thoughts on this book. This book was put-down-able. The other Dan Brown books were fast paced and I had to read it all. It was impossible to tear me away from The Digital Fortress or Angels & Demons or the Da Vinci Code or Deception Point. However, with this novel, I was able to put it down and walk away from it without coming back for several days. I wish that it wasn't this way, because I love Dan Brown's novels, but alas, I feel like he is losing his touch.<br /><br />I think that this happens to a lot of author's once they become well known and popular. Lets look at J.K. Rowlings. After the first several books came out, she became well known. Hence she came out with book number five, which was one of the most painful books I have ever read in my life. It took me two - three months to get through it. Luckily I am such a faithful follower that I returned, and book six redeemed it. But even book seven, you were left wondering how much better it would have been if there hadn't been pressure from publishers and expectations from adoring fans. Another example of this can be seen in Stephanie Meyer. The first book of twilight was amazing... the second two were okay, but the forth book, when she became a megastar, was horrible. It took twists that made me vomit in my mouth. I stopped reading it at page 400 because, even considering it was about vampires and warewolves, it had crossed a line so unbelievable for the world she had created, that I couldn't accept it anymore. So Dan Brown is in good company... lets just hope that he his next novel is better.<br /><br />Now, all of that said and done, I still give the book a 3.5/5 stars. Lets face it, it was a Dan Brown, so it still had the mystery and scandal and conspiracy theories that make all of his novels so wonderful to read. I found myself wanting to know more and more about the Freemasons and the world that they live in. I wanted to somehow sneak into their secret meetings and find out their secrets. I know, I know, it is like they are a cult or something else horrible, but what can I say... I am human and I when I hear about secrets, I just have to know what it is all about.<br /><br />Another positive side about The Lost Symbol is that, for once, Robert Langdon's female counterpart was significantly older and she was portrayed more as a friend then as a lover. I for one was starting to get tired of Landon always hooking up with the lady at the end of the novel.<br /><br />Now, lets talk about what went wrong... Is it possible that Robert Langdon got stupider??? I mean in the other novels, he seemed to figure things out fairly easily, but in this one, someone was always guiding his hand and having to explain things to him. I was very frustrated with him. There were times when I was figuratively screaming at him telling him to wise up! And could he get any more stubborn? It seems like he had all of this evidence put before him throughout the entire novel, and he refused to budge, or even to reevaluate his stance on the Free Masons. It was annoying.<br /><br />Now another problem that was in this novel was the last 50-75 pages. It was so anti-climatic. Why did they have to go to the secret location? There was no point in it. Everything could have been explained to Langdon without going there. And upon finding out what the great secret word was, I was left wondering why was it so secret? What was so important about that secret that it was worth risking everything to protect. It was a huge let down. And I was also left wondering how Peter Solomon seemed to know everything about it, when no one had decoded the pyramid before.<br /><br />Overall, this novel was a huge let down that I am still trying to recover from. But I guess that with all the hype surrounding it, I shouldn't have expected as much as I did... It wasn't really fair to Dan Brown. So the question is, if Dan Brown puts out another novel, will I rush to the bookstore and pick it up and read it??? Answer: In a heartbeat!
B000W91RUG|5.0|My husband and I both love this show.  I still have yet to make it ten minutes into an episode without something making me laugh so hard I'm nearly on the floor with laughter.  It's very geeky.  A lot of inside jokes and it's funnier if you understand humor is involved, but there's still plenty of jokes that are entertaining to non-geeky people.  The acting in this show is AMAZING.  The man that plays Sheldon pulls off the intellectual with no social skills flawlessly.  There's some romance and drama, but mostly it's just a really funny show.  A must see for any humor fan.

Cary Grant and Grace Kelley are a perfect match and Jessie Royce Landis who plays the mother of Grace's character is hilarious.  John Williams plays a very worried and doubtful insurance agent for the jewels in danger of being stolen, a perfect foil to Cary's \\"Cat Burglar\\" character. It's full of unexpected plot twists and turns and comedy the fashions of Edith Head add that touch of class to a very classy film. The locations are breathtaking and the high speed chase on those twisty roads with the steep drop-offs are suspenseful, aided by the helicopter shots that were the earliest used in the filming; Alfred Hitchcock at his best.  This set comes with such extras as an interview with his daughter who was present during the filming, some background on Edith Head, and background on the making of this highly enjoyable film.  Be sure not to miss this one!
B0016K40KY|5.0|One of my favorite movies from a young age.  Peter O'Toole is the great star of the film and Omar Sharif became a major star with this movie.  Lawrence of Arabia is a true character.  A man who in World War I was able to gather Arab tribes to bring down much of the Ottoman Empire while the rest of the British effort on the Eastern Front seemed to fail and die on the vine.  Becoming one with the Arabs and learning to survive in their environment and enjoy the life of the desert allowed him to be much more able to achieve British goals.  He also attempted to defy the British government by pushing for Arab independence rather than British Imperialism.  Wonderful movie and a great acheivement by David Lean.
B003UESJH4|4.0|A troubled childhood leaves the prince a stutterer, but nothing worse. He grows up to be a normal adult, a loving husband and father, and what is more, an intelligent royal with adequate understanding of the role of royalty in politics.<br /><br />As a child the prince was being pinched by the nanny when presented before his parents, the King and the Queen of England, to show him in bad light. He also experienced his younger brother's long illness and subsequent death, and was made to undergo excruciating pain on account of the steel braces he had to wear to set right his knock knees. A very dominating father and a bully of an elder brother completed the picture of the young prince's growing up woes and erosion of self confidence.<br /><br />It takes someone with a deep understanding of human nature to bring to the surface these early life episodes and to show them as the contributing factors for the Prince's speech impairment. The plot of the movie revolves around the lively tussle between the so called speech therapist, Dr Logue (Geoffrey Rush), without a formal medical education and the blue blood (Colin Firth), who finds it very difficult to shed his royal pomposity to accept the therapist as an equal. These moments of vacillation by the prince on the face of contrived provocation by the therapist, gives the movie its high points. Logue shows remarkable sangfroid in his moments of dejection and humiliation. The scene at Westminster Abbey on the eve of the coronation of the Prince as King George VI brings out the best in both Firth and Rush, who play out a protracted duel as vexation, anger and snobbery get a free flow. In the end the duel turns out to be the personal triumph for both the contestants, as both of them overcome great challenges.<br /><br />I had started watching the movie with great hesitation, as I thought stammer is too insignificant a subject to knit a story around. But my fear was short lived because soon I discovered that stammer was just a peg on which hangs a great tale of trust, friendship, and of psychological triumph.<br /><br />As to whether these factors are good enough to bring the movie all the Oscars it won, in the face of stiff competition from other good movies of the year, I have my own doubts.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|Alien invasions have been a tried and tested theme in Hollywood ever since its B-movie inception back in the 40s, but with the advancement in technology and film-making techniques, making a movie of this genre believable and credible should not be a difficult task for the new generation of directors. Unfortunately this particular area of disaster movies has been seldom explored ever since the boom in the VFX industry. Battle : LA promises to bring realism to the alien world invasion backdrop and it succeeds to a certain point. Except, mashing up of two different genres--war movie and alien disaster movie--renders it a rather confused pile of yesterday's pasta.<br /><br />Taking obvious cues from much superior movies like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, Jonathan Liebesman tried to do what directors seldom reflect on in disaster movies--the psychology of the combatants and the relationship dynamics within the squad. But the little thought and reflection that went into developing personalities of the soldiers as depicted in the movie is painfully obvious. The director decided to base the entire movie on a particular squad that rose up to impossible odds against a faceless (literally) enemy, an enemy that could easily have been anything--another invading superpower or just some deranged superheroes holed up underground. The enemy was only vaguely introduced, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, but this movie had a way of making that work to its disadvantage.<br /><br />Performances of various actors seem fit for stock characters that are obligatory fares in a war movie, but a big shout out to Aaron Eckhart, who really brings his superior acting skills to a hodgepodge mess of bad actors. The action sequences are well-executed but could have done with some more realism and better editing. Visual effects and creature design was sub-par, explosions were not that frequent to distract people from the lacklustre storyline and the gunfights lacked a certain intensity for a movie dealing with realism.<br /><br />All in all, the movie should be recommended to only those people who get a kick out of realism in their sci-fi movies, and who really needed something better to watch after the horrendous pile of rubbish that was the earlier release \\"Skyline\\".<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of 'Hits and Misses'dealing with realism.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Good Book. This book made it clear this is not $%&#ing Harry Potter. I never got that vibe, but it appears from many of the reviews I read that a number of people did. I always wondered at the parallels being drawn since the only thing similar I ever noticed was a wizard school. lol.. I'm glad Mr. Rothfuss went ahead and made it a bit more clear for some of you. (IMO)       There are some things I wish had happened that didn't, there are some things that were explained I wasn't overly interested in. But, at times that's the nature of a story.. all will become clear at some point, all of it is spun into place by the Author for a reason. Foreshadowing! It is just for us to enjoy the story (if we enjoy it) and be left wondering in many instances. Sure I WANT ALL THE ANSWERS NOW TOO, but enjoy the journey to them with this wonderfully crafted tale. So, with that said once I started reading it pretty much owned my free time for the next two days until I finished it. To the detriment of work, women, and sometimes eating. Great story which I will recommend here and to my friends in person. I would urge anyone who feels compelled to to post a negative review to read Mr. Rothfuss's blog, if nothing else he seems a fairly impressive human being who is in no way milking us for money. Anything we read in his books has been edited planned and thought about more times than we can imagine. Unless maybe you're a writer reading this.. in which case I'm sure you know!    TLDR: Good book, read it, check out the blog.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|The second and third time through this album, it became infectuous.  Now I've listened to the darn thing about 10 times.  My 14yo daughter, who rebelled against Avril a couple of years ago, loves it.  Great to have that to share together.  The only issue is Avril's propensity for foul language, which runs strongly through many tracks, including a major part of the chorus of two songs.  OTOH, profanity seems to be becoming less of an issue in society, or at least in pop music, as it is so commonplace today that perhaps it is losing its shock value and status.    \\"Push\\" is a very catchy song about working to make a relationship work.  \\"Smile\\" is maybe my favorite song on the album, a tremendous raucous chorus and just plain fun song.  \\"What the Hell\\" is more pure fun, a song that many can identify with at certain times in their lives.  \\"I Love You\\" is a really moving song, again with a catchy pop hook.  \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is yet another moving song with a catchy hook.  There is great doubletracking of Avril's voice in some spots on this album.  It is just simply a very fun, catchy pop album.      On to round 11.
B003BKF696|5.0|Love this group. Very original and melodic. Love the lead singers deep voice and timing. Takes awhile to hear all the words. Wish they'd included words.
0061726826|5.0|I could not put it down.  Read the book in a day!!!! Ready for the next book, hope i don't have to wait too long.
1591843790|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. There was so much actionable advice that I was constantly writing notes as I was reading. This is a must-read for anyone who owns a business. I'm even going to read it again, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
1400052181|4.0|I did enjoy the book but it was perhaps titled incorrectly.  It was not about Henrietta Lacks per se.  She was the begining, going to Johns Hopkins for her cervical cancer but the rest of the book was about the state of her family.  They become important as our disgrace.  We Americans suffer from constant guilt about the portion of our society that began as slaves.  Black people imported into our country became a \\"sinful burden\\" hanging onto us for a couple of hundred years.  And so Rebecca Skloots tells us a tale of Henrietta's descendants and their struggles, their struggles and failures, to integrate into our system (financially).  I learned from Skloot that there is a sense of possession about our cells that I had never considered.  We have biopsies, extractions and snips to our bodies, thinking it serves us well, not thinking that there is an ethic involved.  Perhaps that is a part of the future which we are becoming aware of, thanks to Skloot
1591843790|5.0|This book drew me to it, even before I read it.  I happened upon the slides about Enchantment that Kawasaki shared from a presentation he did at CES 2011.  I simply liked the title.  When you say it out loud, it's soothing, it's magical - at least it is to me.    After reading the book, highlighting and taking notes as I moved from chapter to chapter, I still had a magical feeling.  My beliefs were reinforced - that the simple, common sense things could make all the difference.  Being interesting, being engaging, being kind, dressing appropriately, being well read and well spoken and having the magical ability to build relationships and connect people will make you successful.  At least, it will go a long way towards enabling you to spread enchantment.  As Kawasaki says, \\"Jerks seldom enchant people\\".    I am recommending this book very highly to the followers of my blog - CPAs and people who work for them.  Business leaders often fail to take the time to learn what people are thinking, feeling and believing in order to enchant them.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|I just recently received this blu ray and was a little hesitate about watching it being such a fan of the show and seeing it in it's initial run on broadway...I have seen the other anniversary edition and enjoyed that alot...I have to say this version is very good as well, with the exception of the Jonas kid...He is out of his league...The vocals are top notch except for him...he has a mediocre voice to compete with the cast around him.I do recommend purchasing it and just closing your eyes and imaging Michael Ball in the role of Marius and you will enjoy it...
B004G5VFOU|4.0|Originally started as Steve Winwood's first solo album \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" quickly became a Traffic reunion (minus on and off again member Dave Mason)with the late Jim Capaldi and late Chris Wood. Winwood who supervised this reissue (remastered by Paschal Byrne)elected to drop the two bonus tracks included on the last remaster [[ASIN:B000059T1E John Barleycorn Must Die]] \\"Sittin Here Thinkin' Of My Love\\" and and the song/fragment \\"I Just Want To Know\\" the latter one was strangely put RIGHT in the middle of the album. The original album deserves five stars and this set because it isn't quite as definitive as I would have hoped gets docked a star for not including the two bonus tracks from the previous release and for not including more of the live show on disc two.<br /><br />Winwood did chose to include three alternate mixes for songs included on the original album \\"Strange To Himself\\" (an alternate mix), \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" (the first mix)and \\"Every Mother's Son\\" (an alternate mix). Three live tracks here were on the British edition of \\"JBMD\\"  (which suffered from the overuse of noise reduction)--the introduction, \\"Who Knows What Tomorrow Brings\\" while it appears as if \\"Glad\\" is a different performance of the song (and it is a longer medley with \\"Freedom Rider\\") perhaps from a different night of the same run the band did at the Fillmore. Rich Grech had joined at this point making the band a quartet and helping to fill out their sound as he plays bass and guitar as needed.<br /><br />While I appreciate that Winwood didn't like the two songs included as bonus tracks on the previous edition, since they were previously released it would have made sense to include them with this edition making it the ultimate reissue of the album. Completists might want to hold on to the previous U.S. single disc reissue from a couple of years back as a result.<br /><br />There are also additional live performances from the same show NOT included here and I'm a bit disappointed that the alternate mixes, two tracks from the previous edition weren't included on the first disc with a 10 or 15 second gap much as they used to do with bonus tracks AND included more live material on the second disc.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty good if a bit brighter than the previous CD release remastered by Jeff Willens. The booklet included has a good, solid history of the band and there are some nice pictures included that I hadn't seen before.<br /><br />Over all this is a fine reissue just not the ultimate two disc edition many fans (this one included)were waiting for but the inclusion of the live tracks and the alternate mixes are welcome.inted that the alternate mixes, two tracks from the previous edition weren't included on the first disc with a 10 or 15 second gap much as they used to do with bonus tracks AND included more live material on the second disc.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty good if a bit brighter than the previous CD release remastered by Jeff Willens.

B000069HJL|5.0|Much like \\"Songs in the Attic\\", by Billy Joel, or \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", \\"Paris\\" represents the essential work of the artist, both in terms of performance and material.  The recording was stellar, the performances perfectly honed, and the audience wildly receptive and responsive.  The songs only gain from their live performance, easily outstripping their studio versions, both in pace and production.  If you only own one Supertramp album (like me), this is the one to have.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|My husband and I seldom have time to go to the movies, so I was glad for the opportunity to buy this one and watch it at home.  It is terrific! We were spellbound  by the intensity and action-packed drama of this film.  My husband has watched it two or three times since we both  watched it. It doesn't hurt if you have a facination with trains, as we do, but anybody who likes action will love this film.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|The story of Secretariat is inspiring in the same way to all of the great athlete horse stories are.  Perhaps not as astounding as Seabiscuit or Phar Lap but still a charmer for horse lovers.    The transfer is clean and sharp.  The sound is clear and concentrated mostly in the front channels with little additional environmental sound for the venues where the action takes place.
1400159598|5.0|I have read several of Alastair Reynolds books so far.  His stories reflect his imagination and science background.  Century Rain is off the scale and made my top ten list!  I purchased the audio book and was drawn in to the story line immediately.  A great story from start to finish.  I believe he is getting better with the passage of time and this story is one of his best.  I would highly recommend it.  For me it was a tour de force!
B001LF347E|2.0|If you enjoy stories corrupted by political correctness this is for you. Nothing about it resembles what the original legend portrayed. In it, Arthur is a medieval space cadet focused on occasional sword practice and being lead by the nose by a different woman all the time.  Merlin is a servant of Arthur that lives in the castle and basically does whatever he wishes to do and for a while even hung out with a Dragon in the basement... as silly as that explanation seems, it's basically a fairly honest description. If you can believe that early England was populated in the same way as Great Briton is today, and everyone was equal in medieval society you won't have trouble enjoying this convoluted mess. On the other hand, if you prefer some honesty to the cultural make-up of the people living in England back then and the real lifestyles they led, don't waste your money buying it or for that matter waste your time viewing it.  It's more than fantasy... it's absolute BS.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|I dont know about this movie the first one was great this one should have been left alone. Wasnt really all that into this one.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I read alot of mysteries and bought this number one of the Jack Reacher series with the expectation of finding a new series for me. My hopes started to dim when I realized that could not wait to finish it. The chacters were hollow. The plot  far fetched and the detailed violence unnecessary. I will skip the rest of the series but give it three stars because others will like it.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I love most of the songs on this cd - there were a couple that were meh, but on the whole great music.
B001C48EGK|5.0|Great movie and one that will keep you guessing. I found myself at the edge of my seat with heart pounding.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Mars is an appropriate last name for this singer, as he indeed out of this world. This CD is one-of-a-kind, a rare bird. It raises the bar for the music industry, and is a must-have for any gender, any age. The music is certainly modern but there is a classic quality, a sense of longevity, as well. The lyrics are awesome, poetic, sometimes haunting and definitely worth listening to. The songs cover a wide range of topics and includes a wide range/mix of musical genres. I bought the CD for \\"Grenade,\\" but I was unexpectedly and happily impressed by the entire CD, which rarely happens. Above all, the gracious voice of and empathetically artistic delivery by Bruno Mars are what makes this CD so great! Dare I say it. Bruno Mars may be one of the best singers/song-writers/musicians ever - period.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|All Of Avril's albums are wonderful. This cd is her best album yet. The songs, \\"Push, I Love You, Everybody Hurts, and Not Enough\\" are all amazing. Amazing album!
B001UV4XWY|3.0|The Box is one of those movies which I wish I had read the original from which it is based.  Based on Richard Matheson's story, \\"Button Button,\\" the story starts with a philosophical question - For a million dollars, would you be willing to have the knowledge that your decision causes the death of another person whom you don't know.<br /><br />Norma and Arthur Lewis (played by Cameron Diaz and James Marsden) find a box on their doorstep.  When Arthur has left, a mysterious man (Frank Langella) appears and explains how the box works.  If Norma presses the button, she would recieve a million dollars, but someone she does not know would die because of it.  The one condition is that they cannot tell anybody or do any research regarding this matter.<br /><br />Regardless of whether they pressed the button or not, the couple soon realizes that they are being targeted because of other actions they take not related to pressing the button.  The viewer is then taken through a series of surreal logic and visions explaining the purpose of the box experiment.<br /><br />In the end, the couple must make another decision. And regardless of believable the circumstances are, this last situation is the product of all the events that took place up to that point.<br /><br />This movie took me on a wild ride where at times I didn't know where it was going or why.  The ending left some questions, but the ride did end, and there was no uncessary detours on the route.<br /><br />The acting itself was okay, and I guess that's what bring it down to three stars.  Frank Langella, however, does a really good job as the mystery man.  Although normally, I separate the movie from the written originals, in this case, I am curious to see how much of the essence of the original this movie contained.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This is an awesome album. My favorite song is \\"Talking to the Moon.\\" Very catchy, cute, and wonderful songs. Great debut album. 5/5
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I received this dvd on 3/19/11 in the mail, even though it isn't even on store shelves yet! Beautiful movie that leaves you wanting more! Even better than the series. I can't wait for part 3.<br /><br /> The dvd came in an awesome orange slipcover with a rough texture. On the actual dvd cover is the new female 05th Eva pilot.<br /><br />The special features on disc 2 are pretty worthless.<br /><br />The dvd is only 10 dollars on amazon right now, and that's an epic steal. I paid about 18 on rightstuf.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|the rambo trilogy is a great set. i just bought it and watched all 3 in one week! all are action packed and never get boring.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I'm not usually a big indie flick kind of person, but this move was SO well done, and the acting--holy crap, the acting.  I've never seen a movie with so little dialogue b/c it's not even needed--Spader and Gyllenhall's eyes, the very rare contact between them--says so much. There's this one scene where you can literally see Spader's character pull into himself and there's not a word said.  I mean, seriously, this movie has flaky layers of movie awesomeness.  I love the way it shows how a relationship--no matter the style--has to grow organically; too often relationships are defined and compared to what is actually their caricature:  from classic 50's hetero to BDSM harnesses and ball-gags to gay cowboys eating pudding--none of these represent the natural relationships that arise between two people.  What's relatable for anyone who's been in love is the same across the board: there's something in one that calls and the other answers (and vice versa).      Beautifully done; I just wish there were some guide besides the commentary to help out with all that symbolism and meaning there.  This movie should've won tons of awards.  Wish iTunes carried it.
0060589280|5.0|From the title i was not expecting to find what i found inside the pages of this book. But i'm glad i decided to read it. I think every man shoud read this book to understand women better, and women shoud read it to understand themselves better, like i did. Thank you Paolo Coelho! You're awesome!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Must have for shooter games - perfect design, stay attached to remote without issue. I have bought 3 sets, one for each remote. Not much to them, they provide great leverage and comfort during game play. Recommend to anyone with a PS3.
0061124265|5.0|Once again i'm impressed and i'm falling in love with Paulo Coelho. A book that makes you think, opens your eyes.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I expected a supernatural tale somewhere along the lines of white noise, instead a got a look at different relationships that had been touched in different ways by death. Good enough just not what I expected.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|The Book of Eli is an entertaining action film.  It's about a man who has invincible (or rather, nearly invincible) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.      He also contains super human strengths apparently, whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- I don't necessarily know which one it is.    Anyway, he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he's travelling west, until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he's carrying it.      The entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who don't know how to handle its power.    I really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie.  It's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly.  The grey clouds, the eerie silence, the emptiness... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.    The acting is pretty good for the most part, however my only complaint is that the storyline wasn't strong enough to keep me attached.  There's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.    However some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good, my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart.  I loved this part.      Overall, the Book of Eli is a pretty good film.  It's easy to follow, and the action segments are pretty strong.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|at first I thought this was going to be a very low budget film with poor acting<br />boy was I wrong, the acting is very good and believable.<br />the plot is quite strong and keeps you guessing until the end.<br />the acting and few special effects are on par with other films of this type though<br />this angle is quite refreshing. I wasn't quite sure how they would pull off<br />an entire film in an elevator and keep my interest, well they did and did it well. the suspense is well played here and gets more suspenseful throughout the film and by no means a perfect blockbuster hit I believe this will become a \\"cult classic\\" over time and it's worth a rental at minium! a solid Four Star Title!<br /><br />*****************SPOILERS AHEAD*******************<br />*****************Spoiler Warning******************<br />a diverse group of people are trapped in an elevator and the elevator seems to want<br />to keep the people it has inside. after efforts begin to retrieve the trapped people in the elevator someone gets a mysterious injury and another passenger<br />of the elevator gets the blame. one after another incidents happen and others<br />recieve blame. the film isn't really what I would call \\"action packed\\" but as a suspense horror film it works well. the final scene with the old lady telling the last survivor how \\"lucky\\" he was and how close \\"she\\" was.<br />I really enjoyed this film and it quite reminded me of good horror/suspense films of the 80's with far better acting/effects (what few there are)<br />overall a great film for a dark and spooky night<br />with M Night!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I saw this film, which I have pre-ordered on Amazon, three times already; and I daresay I shall watch it many more times. \\"The King's Speech\\" is adult entertainment in the most noble sense of the expression. The script is outstanding in its intelligence, and if there were an award for the best use of profanity in context without giving offence, I would definitely give it to \\"The King's Speech.\\" The film is simply splendid! Without benefit of car chases, explosions, or overly-spectacular CGI, the audience is riveted--indeed, held spellbound--for 119 minutes by a simple scenario: a wife seeks professional help for her husband's speech impediment; he undergoes therapy and with persistent practice, he overcomes--if not conquers--his problem despite the low expectations of the public and, most of all, of himself. That the wife is the Duchess of York and the husband is the future King of England is irrelevant and at the same time empowering: the story contains a universal truth; the future king, like the kings of Greek tragedy, represents every man as he learns through suffering.<br /><br />Since the actors have been deservedly praised to the skies, I shall comment only upon a few points that impressed me. Colin Firth's portrayal of Bertie is so believable, because he conveys the unimaginable physical tension of a man whose thoughts are entrapped within his body; and paradoxically, Firth does so with ease; there is nothing forced about his portrayal. Geoffrey Rush, who plays his therapist Lionel Logue with sensitivity and humour, is certainly Firth's equal. It is a shame that a double Oscar could not have been awarded. Both Firth and Rush provide an equilibrium that would certainly be upset if either one were taken away (or if one were one replaced by another actor). I was especially struck by Rush's ability to portray a not-very-good amateur, when he tries out for the part of Richard III; he suggests an ever-so slight hamminess without actually hamming it up. A difficult challenge for any actor, much less one of his stature! I also thought that Helena Bonham Carter, who exhibits a combination of privilege and propriety tempered by kindness, was a perfect foil for Jennifer Ehle (Rush's wife), who exhibits similar characteristics and also understands the boundaries of decorum: a wonderful moment comes when a surprised Ehle politely asks the royal couple if they will be staying for dinner, and the Duchess graciously thanks her and cites a previous engagement as if it were a necessary annoyance.<br /><br />One of the things that British filmmakers do so well is to cast supporting roles with top-drawer actors, disguising them thoroughly. I found myself reading the credits the first time around and exclaiming to my friend: \\"Good Heavens! Anthony Andrews was playing Stanley Baldwin. I certainly didn't recognise him!\\" Claire Bloom also inhabited the persona of Queen Mary so thoroughly that I didn't know it was she until the end credits. It took a few minutes for me to recognise Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, and I recognised Michael Gambon as George V only by his voice, and a certain look in his eyes. Each submerges his own personality into his respective role. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Timothy Spall, who provides what I consider the only false note, giving me the impression that he is no other than Timothy Spall, pouting, and acting Churchillian. I found it most expedient to avert my eyes whenever he came on the screen and focus on all the other things to love about this movie.<br /><br />This film combines pathos with humour. My friend and I were blubbering (as silently as possible) and laughing (out loud) all the way through it. And because of the skills of Colin Firth and Jeffrey Rush in conveying the feelings of Bertie and Lionel, our emotional responses were spontaneous and not prised out of us, as happens too often in films nowadays. I was especially moved as the film reached its climax, knowing the tragedy that was about to strike Europe, the people of England, and indeed the world. I therefore found the Allegretto movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony to be especially appropriate as King George reads his speech. The music acts as a funeral march and it emphasises the gravity of the situation and the gravity of the actual words which King George VI, via the radio, delivered so eloquently to the world, giving it the courage to persist in one of its darkest hours.<br /><br />The King's speech remains emblematic of one man's courage.

B002ZG994U|2.0|My wife & I watched this last night and just laughed at how bad the lines and plot were.  There are some nice action sequences but some of the scenes are just TOO fake to be believable.  It's maybe worth a rent, but I regret purchasing it b/c I know we will never want to watch it again.  If you are okay with bad lines and totally impossible action sequences, then you might like this one.  My wife would be mad that I actually gave this 2 stars instead of 1.
030726999X|5.0|This book along with the other two of the series was one you could not<br />put down.  there are parts that get very long, but read it all,  there<br />is so much information for the story line.<br />I loved this series
0525423273|5.0|My thoughts before reading Anna and the French Kiss were centered around the cover, title, and the hype. The cover looks fun, the title sounds flirty, and the hype had me weary.    When I began reading, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it. Anna was whiney, and annoyed me a bit. I can understand her being upset, because despite the fact that she was going to Paris (PARIS!), she was being shipped off to another country during her final year in high school, when everything in her life seems to be going well. I'd be homesick before I ever left my city, let alone the country. Still, the way she handled it and her thought process just made me want to tell her to shut the hell up.     I got over that quickly. Most likely the moment St. Clair entered the picture. Um, hottie with an English accent? Yes please! (Yeah, I totally fit into that 'American girls love English accents' stereotype) But it was more than that. It was every character. They all had depth, and I was surprised at this. I don't know what I went in expecting, but it wasn't what I got. Fascinating, memorable characters? Check. Engaging setting? Check.  Chemistry?? Double check. Like, dripping off the pages, chemistry. Realistic dialogue? Check. GREAT love story? CHECK.    My one complaint (well, two) is the cover and the title. I liked them at first. Both make it look like a fun read. But I felt like the novel was more than a fun read. The girl on the cover isn't at all what I imagined, and she can't possibly be eighteen. As for the title, I think it makes the story seem cheap and shallow. Anna and the French Kiss is definitely not cheap or shallow. It was fantastic!!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I gotta be honest.  I'm 43.  I'm a mom to two teenagers.  I work full time....  I'm TIRED.  Not a LOT makes me feel like I'm 19 again.  But dang y'all - this album is un-frikkin-believable.  These boys make music that is solid, tight, and AMAZING.  I haven't been THIS excited about an album (see, there I go, dating myself by using words like \\"album\\") since \\"Icky Thump\\".<br /><br />Go out and get yourself a copy of \\"Brothers\\".  (Heck, get 2 copies and give one away.  Share the love.)<br />Gives me HOPE for the American music scene when we have incredible young musicians like The Black Keys at the helm.<br /><br />Rock on, boys...
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Perhaps others have different opinions about the greatest film ever to come out of the United States.  But this classic, set in Casablanca in the last few days before the raid on Pearl Harbor and the German declaration of war brought the country into the global war, has everything.  If you have not seen this one, get it.
B00433TO52|1.0|I really don't see how anybody can give this half-finished junk more than one star. However, I must confess I haven't read it all. In fact, I have only looked up the end of Julius Caesar to compare with a recent production I went to. I was appalled to see several instances where a stage comment appeared as part of Shakespeare's glorious lines. For example, where Brutus commits suicide:<br /><br />BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato. Runs on his sword<br />Caesar, now be still;<br />.....<br /><br />Even the stupidest, laziest proof reader should have spotted this and at least introduced bracketed italics for the stage instruction - something to make it clear that it is not part of the prose. This type of thing occurs so often with ebooks based on source that is out of copyright that one can only conclude that proof-reading is regarded as an extra. In addition to this type of error, this Shakespeare is very poorly and amateurishly formatted. They don't even bother to ensure that each play begins on a new page!<br /><br />In short, unless you have no aesthetic appreciation for the greatest of literature, avoid this product - it is utterly without merit. It's time the producers of ebooks realised that it is essential to minimise errors in books - they are regularly used as references in course work, for example, and have to be reliable. Anything less is a confidence trick and should invite legal action.
0307704610|4.0|This book has some very interesting information and ideas, however the way it is written makes it difficult to follow.   If you are looking for a specific fitness program or detailed meal plan this book is not the one for you.
B004RL9T50|4.0|I'll keep this short, but my family really enjoyed Megamind. The characters were pretty cool, the story pretty funny, and the concept fairly novel. Your kids will enjoy it, and so will your adults. If anything was out of place or subpar, it was Jonah Hill's character, but i think that was an intentional decision by the producers.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|The Knife are an amazing group with truly interesting and compelling music. Silent Shout is one of my favorite albums of all time and the live DVD is hands down the best concert DVD out there (yes, better than Stop Making Sense). The live album offers interesting re-imaginings of some of their best tracks across all of their albums. I can't put into words exactly how awesome this live concert is, it changed my life.    I love this so much I bought two, just in case one gets lost/stolen/broken or if none of that happens so I have one to pass down to my children so they can see a truly amazing moment in music history.
076115678X|5.0|Being a curly girl most of my live this book has helped me out so much.  I have much better hair days and I can say Lorraine Massey knows what she is talking about.  I love how she put stories of other curly girls and their stories from their past.
0312370830|5.0|This book tells a horrifying story of a terrible time in history.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
B0000584V3|5.0|No it isn't their best, in my opinion. I prefer their earlier stuff, they don't have a bad album though. Orchid is their worst and it was their first, they were just getting started. Blackwater Park is still 100% essential to an Opeth fan and I'd recommend it. It takes their heavy side from My Arms, Your Hearse and their melodic side from Still Life. It covers a lot of ground and it shows their signature sound. It doesn't seem like they put as much effort into it though and it's more accessible. It includes The Drapery Falls, the album and the song got Opeth more popular. I still really enjoy it but it isn't flawless.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie... imo Bruce's best since Pulp Fiction.  What starts off slow becomes an action-packed thriller, stylish and fast-paced high octane movie well worth watching.<br /><br />The entire supporting cast was brilliant, the pacing, dp work on cuts/video edits and writing was outstanding - this is one of the better movies I've seen in recent years.  Bravo, everyone.  It's fun, it's fast-paced with action sequences and plot turns, and overall an outstanding movie.  I hope there's a sequel or two.  Bruce you were great in Pulp Fiction, Die Hard and Fifth Element, this is your best work in addition to those. This one clicked.  Thanks!<br /><br />-ken
044024157X|4.0|This novel is NOT the typical John Grisham legal thriller/murder mystery (though it contains elements of both), so the back cover description is deceptive.  What it is is a look at a small town in Mississippi in the 1970s, seen through the eyes of a young man who finds himself running the town's weekly newspaper.  It reminded me of some of Dickens' works, which were \\"incidents in the life of ______\\"--type novels.  TLJ is well-written, has good character development, and enough of a plot to pull you along.  The reason there are so many negative reviews is that readers were expecting something else, and are expressing their disappointment.  But if you know what you are getting when you start I think you will find this a good read.      I must take issue with one of the reviews here.  In the novel Grisham takes shots at Wal-mart/K-mart type stores [under a different name, of course] for wreaking havoc on the economic and social lives of small towns.  Being opposed to this is called by a reviewer \\"liberal\\".  Well, I am more conservative than Reagan, and I deplore what these big-box stores have done to rural America, turning the downtown areas of so many towns, which used to be alive, vibrant places, into ghost-towns.   Sure, people can get some things cheaper than before, but can we truly say life is better, more worth living, in such places?
B003W5C0VM|5.0|The Rolling Stones, the greatest rock-roll band in the world, bar none !!!!! Their name should be included in the dictionary next to the definition of rock-roll. Their mid-period (1968-1973) musical vision of the American south seen through British sensibilities is phenomenal. Their high water mark was the year 1972, and this film captures their onslaught of rawness and attitude during this period. No band touring during 1972 could touch them, including led Zeppelin. This is rock-roll the way it should be played, and the way it should look. Rock on !!!!!!!!
1594202842|2.0|This writer goes back and forth telling the story.  I was expecting great things, but am disappointed, not about the content, but about the manner in which the story is told.  If I hadn't really wanted to read the story, I would have quit by the second chapter. Of course, the mother is unwaveringly strict and the girls fight with her, to no avail.  All in all I was disappointed by the book.
B0041KKYCY|1.0|The first movie was better.  The acting in this movie is atrocious.  It seemed like the actors were reading their lines from Q cards.  The violence in the rape scene was laughable.  You don't feel sad for the woman.  Most of the time remakes are never as good as the original.  That is the case with this one.  The original was made over twenty years ago is way better.  This might be worth a watch just to see for your self, but it is  not worth buying.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This was a great film, humor definitely geared for adult appreciation! I haven't laughed this hard in a movie for a long time.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Started out a little slow but as the movie went on it picked up steam and led to a pretty exciting climax. Denzel Washington is the most underrated actor in Hollywood and Chris Pine was good as well. i recommend it.
1559210400|3.0|The disappointment is not in her writing. Having been on a reading sprint of her wonderful novels, I had looked forward to more of her great storytelling. This book is different, though. It's more about a sharp transitional period in China's history. Although the history is good to know, a historical explanation wasn't what I was looking for. So this is my least favorite of her books.
B002ZG98C8|2.0|If you like blood, this is the movie for you. The fight / blood scenes were way over the top and not that realistic looking but it was action packed. Not sure why he gets as many women as he does but this is hollywood. Not sure Steven Seagal makes for a good \\"bad\\" guy. Could have been better.
0811869261|5.0|We love MOUK and we are so happy that this title is now available in English! Here is a suggestion, if you love MOUK: you will be madly in love with another French character 'Barbapapa'!  Barbapapa (meaning Cotton Candy in French) is both the title character, and name of the \\"species\\" of said character, of a series of children's books written in the 1970s by Annette Tison and Talus Taylor, who resided in Paris, France. You can still purchase the books and DVD's in Europe (or through Amazon.fr - available in French or Amazon.co.jp with DVD's available in French/English/Japanese, make sure to get a multi-region DVD player). The story is always educational and there is always a message: to protect the earth, the animals, nature. One of the most positive books for children ever created! Barbapapa was and still is a huge hit in France, Belgium and Japan. Unfortunately, Barbapapa was never really distributed in the USA. If you want to bring up your children with a positive and peaceful message, you should give Barbapapa a try! One of the most undiscovered gems in children's literature. Barbapapa is the best!
0446691437|5.0|Rarely will a nonfiction book get me so engrossed that time stands still as I read it.  But The War of Art was that rare book.  Only 192 pages, I read it on a Sunday morning over a cup of coffee (or two).  Pressfield wrote this book for me, the procrastinator. And he spelled out in plain language what makes me procrastinate:  Resistance.    Resistance is that thing that keeps us from doing anything we want to do, pursue any creative project (including writing), diet or exercise, making a commitment to overcome a bad habit or addiction.  Any pursuit, really, that doesn't give immediate gratification. Leave it to Resistance to make sure there are plenty of other things we find to do instead.    My favorite quote from the book is this:  \\"Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it's the easiest to rationalize. We don't tell ourselves, `I'm never going to write my symphony.'  Instead we say, `I am going to write my symphony; I'm just going to start tomorrow.'\\"  Wow!  Me in a nutshell.    Part practicality and part spirituality, The War of Art spells out what Resistance is and how it lures us into battle and kicks our butts if we let it.  Part Two delves into how to battle Resistance by turning from amateur to Pro (which is all about attitude, not cash flow).    The third part of the book wasn't as interesting to me, as it was where the \\"spiritual\\" came in, but it gives a peek into Pressfield's early writing career through his first big success, the writing of the book, The Legend of Bagger Vance, which later became a movie starring Will Smith, which is quite inspirational.  Some readers might be interested in his talk of Muses and angels, Self and Ego, but I started to drift about this time.  A few sections of Part Three held my attention, especially the part about fear.    However, the first two thirds of the book were well worth the money.  I would recommend this to any writer (any creative person, really), who wants to know what causes the procrastination that keeps them from doing what they really long to do.  I'll be rereading  The War of Art more than once, I know.

B002VJ0576|4.0|Mousey? Oh, I get it. Holmes should be played by Hulk Hogan, Brian Blessed, or Tor Johnson. So what if this film was made to capitalize on the Downey flick? Ben Snyder is a thousand times better as Holmes than Downey's Iron Man/Bruce Lee/rock star travesty. Sure, I admit the movie had a thousand faults (for example, mercury poisoning from seafood was unknown in 1882), but it was fun. At least I was going \\"ha ha\\" (or \\"yawn\\") every few minutes rather than \\"Eccch!\\"
B00000K3UU|1.0|I was handed a bucnh of vhs tapes that someone did not want anymore and I only saw as much as I could take of this one and I thru it in the trash Here's a movie that has it all, acceptance of homosexuality, cussing at a child, sex before marriage or outside of marriage, and a lowest of human beings has been given the integrity to be a Dad. Lord help us!
1452101248|5.0|Definitely worth it if you are looking for new/inventive ways to eat! Not like any other book out there.  I am only not in love the puffy cover on the new American edition.  Not sure who thought that was a great idea, nonetheless a great find!!!    FYI: I noticed many previous comments note that measurements are in metric, which must be for the previously published British edition.  This is the newly published American edition and is in standard American measurements.     Cheers!
0060936223|1.0|Most uninteresting and amazingly (for an adult) self-centered text. A string of boring little details which read like a phone book. No analysis of the characters. No philosophical thoughts about the meaning of the events from the perspective of years past. Name dropping. That's all.     It seems to me that S. and M. (Smith's life-long friend) are typical examples of self-proclaimed \\"artists\\" who may lack talent but are desperate to make it (financially!) in NY, of all places. What does one do when he or she cannot offer beautiful substance? Shock the public with an ugly form. Just create a splash to attract attention. Then call it \\"art\\". Is punk anything but a footnote in world's music? Can we even compare Smith's \\"music\\" with that of Janis Joplin or Jim Morrison? In addition, as a gay man, I find M.'s \\"work\\" hardly artistic. Some of it is unnecessarily repulsive. This book seems like a excellent reflection of the superficiality and primitiveness that emanated the lives of its main characters.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|Not many people I talk with remember Street Hawk. I thought it was a great show back when it began and it's still just as fun to watch.<br />I would love to see a remake movie/TV series. The problem with a remake is that they always fail to capture what made the show a hit. An example is Team Knight Rider, Knight Rider 2010.  KR 2010, and Team Knight Rider are good ford commercials but KITT Was not a ford and the original show was actually watchable. When they change all the characters/hero's, theme music, and general design they create an entirely different entity. The new creation is usually a shocking mutilation of the original work. I'm not sure who makes these decisions but its a very consistent problem. Airwolf is another show that is deserving of some positive recognition.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|After reading an internet review of different 3D movies currently available, I bought this movie because it had highly rated effects.  The visuals are stunning and even more so with live actors vs animation.  The only downside is the movie has almost too much violence and blood but aside from that, very good.
0446605409|5.0|I'm thinking if I keep reading Mr DeMille's superb books. I may NEVER get any sleep.  :) This is another can't put down book, which I enjoyed from cover to cover. Keep them coming, Mr. DeMille I really don't mind yawning so much,in the morning. I can always make more coffee, but keep me up all night good books are hard to find.  :)
142311339X|5.0|I love that Rick keeps coming up with new ideas to augment his world based on the very old but much used Greek Mythology (or in this case, Roman Mythology). I also liked that he expanded on the universe of Percy Jackson without repeating himself. All in all, this was a very entertaining and intriguing read. I can't wait to see what happens in the next one. Keep them coming, Riordan!
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|I saw Bruno Mars perform on the Soul Train awards. He sung the song Grenade.I was amazed by his voice. I heard him on the B.O.B. hit song. He sound wonderful. But he is such a pleasure to listen to solo. I really like this album. HE will be very successful.!
006112429X|1.0|What can I say? This book was wordy, unbelieveably so. Because of the wordiness and the sheer pretentiousness of the words, I found it incredible hard to believe or relate to Eva. I oscillated between feeling flat out disgust at the things that this mother said and thought about her own son, to understanding some of her thought process and feeling frustration with the husband of the story. While I'm glad that I did decide to go ahead and finish the book (simply because the ending through me), I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book at all. I think that this story would have been told so much better if the Eva, the main narrator through these letters, was more personable, lovable, grief stricken, something.
B0042816YK|3.0|didn't think I would, but I did like this movie. I tend not to care too much for melodramatic movies about the rich and their little problems, but...<br /><br />If you aren't sick of movies about very wealthy people having spiritual crises and going off to find themselves (and extremely handsome lovers), it's worth a watch.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|As the grandmother of an 11 year old grandson diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, I completely understood and related to this movie and to what Temple went through. Clare Danes who played the part of Temple did an incredible job.  The expressions of pain on her face was the same pain I have seen in my grandson, when he cannot process what is going on. These parts made me cry.  It is also a movie of incredible hope for what the outcome can be with people who love, support and understand this syndrome. I had moments of utter heartbreak, and moments of fun and joy while watching this. If you have contact with anyone with Asperbers Syndrome, this is a must see.
B002T9H2LK|2.0|As the DVD package it is excellent. But, as a movie weak! A warm'd over \\"Dirty Dozen\\"! And this is coning from a person who love's both the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" & all of Quentin Tarantino's work (so far). I guess I was expecting more form this than it is...Only buy if you must...
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This is a great case for the money. It is basically a hard side case, there are plastic inserts in the leather walls on all sides of the case (except the top which has to be flexible), so it protects the headset quite well. The interior is lined with a soft fabric. I love the magnetic latch on the closure flap. Well designed, it works great to protect the Voyager Pro + bluetooth, I don't have to worry about it getting crushed in my backpack with this. It's rare these days to get something with this kind of quality for this little money.
B001Q2RXJC|5.0|Saxon's second album is one of the best examples of the greatness that was the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.  While not as technically proficient as Iron Maiden or as heavy as Judas Priest, Saxon were one of the top metal bands of the early `80s with their brand of blue collar metal. This album is all about believing in yourself and band's love of transportation, especially motorcycles. \\"Motorcycle Man\\" starts out with the Harley racing down the highway before launching into a fierce attack led by Biff Byford's powerful vocals. Their zeal and passion never let up as one great anthem blends into another only slowing down a bit on the excellent mid-tempo \\"747 (Strangers in the Night)\\" and the melodic \\"Suze Hold On\\" and even those songs rock. Otherwise, \\"Street Fighting Gang\\", \\"Freeway Mad\\", \\"Machine Gun\\", \\"See the Light Shining\\", and \\"Stand Up and Be Counted\\" are all wicked tracks with awesome riffs from Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver and strong performances from the rhythm section of Steve Dawson and Pete Gill. The title track is their signature song, their \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Walk This Way\\" if you will, and is one of the all-time great metal anthems. This is Saxon's best album (Strong Arm of the Law is close) and if you love heavy metal, this is a must have.
0061564893|1.0|Were this marketed as alternative history, I'd give this four stars.  But instead, it's asserted to be accurate.  To write a complete debunking of every claim in the book would be longer than the book itself, and I'm simply more interested in other projects.    Instead, I will merely use one example of a fundamental error: the Chinese character for 10,000.    Menzies takes that to mean exactly that - 10,000.  Unfortunately for his analysis, the Chinese used that character to also mean \\"a lot\\".  Proof of this can be found in money from the era which included a gold figurine no larger than a redskin potato labeled \\"10,000 ounces\\".      If he cannot bother to get a basic translation correct (as opposed to relying on transliteration) without bothering to question why China would have ships and fleets way out of proportion to what one would expect, what does it say about the rest of his analysis?
B000002TQV|5.0|Talk about a leap forward. When Radiohead were riding the charts with \\"Creep\\" in 1993, the band appeared destined to be one of the many one-hit wonders of the grunge era. The fact that the album from which it came from, Pablo Honey, was mostly competent grunge rock seemed to confirm that suspicion. And then came The Bends. It was here where the band found both beauty and drama and you can argue that this is their best album. Thom Yorke really came into his own as both a songwriter and singer. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is simply one of the most beautiful songs of the last 20 years, mainly because of both Yorke's outstanding vocals and the band's dramatic performance. The single \\"High and Dry\\" was similar in scope with its acoustic verses and Yorke's falsetto vocals but was a bit more understated. While the harder guitar sound of the debut is still present, the songs are way better and the band really sound confident as \\"Bones\\" and \\"Just\\" rocked with a certain swagger that you didn't hear often during this time. \\"Black Star\\" and the title track are even better and are downright majestic in their use of drama and their loud guitars. The rest of the songs are all top notch and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" ends the album on a very somber note. Radiohead is one of the few bands around that you can accurately call artists and The Bends is the first of several masterpieces.
0060765488|5.0|The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.<br /><br />Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus. Her brothers and sister make fun of her. Edmund will be second and he meets the Witch, Queen Jadis, who has taken over the country.

He will have there the strongest and most interesting surprise in his life.<br /><br />That leads to the confrontation of Aslan and his human and Narnian supporters on one hand, and Queen Jadis and her own supporters on the other hand. The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.<br /><br />He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief.

That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend.

The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.<br /><br />Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them.

Unscrupulous people supplying bootleg copies must be rubbing their hands with glee, and in any case it's a bad business ploy to leave the release so long that your main fan base has died off!

It was a terrific read and from a person who has been exposed to many signs of late, reading this book has given me the courage to continue on what my heart feels right. Thanks for an excellent read.

She turns into Bella, basically.     At least Gale lives. Good for you, Gale, Katniss was always kind of annoying.

0307473708|2.0|This book opened really well for me :<br /><br />Moon. Glorious moon. Full, fat, reddish moon, the night as light as day, the moon light flooding down across the land and bringing joy, joy, joy. Bringing, too, the full-throated call of the tropical night, the soft and wild voice of the wind roaring through the hairs on your arm, the hollow wail of starlight, the teeth-grinding bellow of the moonlight off the water.<br /><br />All calling to the Need.<br /><br />Ok, so he's no poet but you can see that he has an awareness of how the beats should pound in and out of a story to give if proper rhythm, and while he's still experimenting and hasn't got it you can see it's a pretty good try. So this book might be pretty good, right? Wrong. Maybe it has to do with the fact that he'd married into Steinbeck's family. Must be a lot of pressure tied up there and you can see that sometimes in the text he's sweating bullets to try and make it work, to try and get it to all pull together. But in seeking to imitate other's work he comes off less like the contemporary of those who's work he often admires and more like a thin imitation of Kerouac, Harlan Ellison and Bret Easton Ellis at their worse. If only he had concentrated a little less on filling other people's shoes and more on crafting a pair of his own.<br /><br />Oh, it's not all bad. There are some good parts in here. I love the slightly incestuous relationship between Dexter and his brother that somehow manages to be completely devoid of all sexuality, the odd bits of humor, and the ties between his need to kill and the stages of the moon were also something neat to ponder when you think about possible the possible connotations and connections to menstruation but that's about it. Mostly the bad far out weighs the good.<br /><br />Pacing? Completely unbalanced. The characters? Woefully under developed and unlikeable. Another point against it is Lindsay's shyness about showing the actual crimes Dexter commits. Why? In the TV series it's excusable since we are dealing with a medium that needs to be accessible to a larger audience but does it really work for the books? No. Why be so coy? Is it really an attempt to shield the reader? Does Lindsay not have the imagination or the guts to go into detail? Even the plot its self seemed to fall apart the closer you got to it. Step away and you can kind of make out the lady with the pet monkey taking a walk in the park. But get closer and all you see is random, unconnected bits taking up space.<br /><br />I might continue reading these to see if they get better, there are worse ways to spend one's time, but I'll certainly be in no great rush to go out and get the others any time soon.dealing with a medium that needs to be accessible to a larger audience but does it really work for the books?

B0010OIN90|1.0|My son loved getting this.  Too bad the band broke within the firt 5 minutes of him getting it.  The quality is terrible.  The watch band is adjustable, but the links fall apart when he is wearing it.  The attachments for the links are made of plastic.  They are not durable and easily break.  Even worse the pins that hold the band onto the watch are not removable - thus you cannot buy a different band for the watch.

B004P9FAK2|1.0|I along with many other people bought year 3&4 expecting the deleted scenes to be added to the movies since year 1&2 had them. I was disappointed as most were that WB chose do not offer this option on further releases with out making their decision clear in the press release. If you offer something on the initial launch of a product you should make it clear if you remove a major selling feature of that product. It was not false advertising as WB never stated their would be extended cut of the movie on 3&4... but it is misleading.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Clint Eastwood is always throwing his films in the crowd of onlookers as if it were a bomb or a good uppercut or some kind of blackmailing session of arm twisting. And this Hereafter trip into dead territory and death's kingdom is one more provocation right in our faces.<br /><br />What is there beyond death? A beyond or hereafter that no one knows except a few who have been able to come back but who are regarded by people as some kind of zombies or crazy ranting and raving extra-terrestrials. He takes a little of Dead Zone by Stephen King and he turns his film into a journey across the world from San Francisco to London and Paris where we meet three exceptional beings. A twin brother who has lost his twin in some ugly road accident. A TV anchorwoman who has died in a tsunami and managed to come back. And a medium who suffered some health problem in his youth and died a couple of times or more on the operating table.<br /><br />The whole film will aim at bringing the three together one way or another and make them discover there is something, even some life beyond those deadly and fatal events. At the same time he settles some long deserved accounts with a few people, among others French publishers who are as frigid as for publishing kinky things as old spinsters who have dedicated their whole lives to looking at the tip of their shoes. Jean Yves Berteloot in that role is cruel and so realistic that he is truer than truth itself. And we can think of absolutely all French publishers as being some rancid loveless and heartless old crumbs lost under a pile of rotting wood.<br /><br />But the film is also a good fist blow right into the noses of the audience. Terrifying pictures of a tsunami, we used to say tidal wave in the old days, all the more frightening because of the recent Japanese tsunami. Horrifying pictures of death: death in the hands of that natural cataclysm; death in the hands of an underground catastrophe in London; death in the hands of some bullies against a younger child causing his deadly fate in the middle of the street; death in the hands of heroin, the famous horse that stampedes and gallops more often and longer than we can imagine.<br /><br />And yet Clint Eastwood wants us to believe there is some bright side in that story. The medium who cannot have a normal life since he can't touch anyone without being transported into their hereafter and there-before, will be saved by love. The forlorn twin will find solace in his own dead brother who will know more about life than the living now he is dead. The TV anchorwoman who will find love and hope in someone who can see beyond the surface. Even the horrid horse will find its master in the hands of some good doctors.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's realism is the main power and force in this film. He whips you around with pictures so true that they become divine with truth and life together. And you better say thank you to the old man who is there to show the future in the past and the present in the visionary ranting and raving of the insane, and we are all insane somewhere, so we are all aware of the present, the past and the future, but 99.99% of these people are 200% sure death is the final end of life. Well, I am ready to bet it is not, though when I know I won't be able to cash my bet.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUusing his deadly fate in the middle of the street; death in the hands of heroin, the famous horse that stampedes and gallops more often and longer than we can imagine.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|It's slow going at the beginning and then picks up as it goes along.  I loved the first one but I really hate prequels.  Guess I wasn't paying enough attention to connect the two movies but each one stands alone. AFter reading reviews here I'm even more confused since there was no child in the first movie which is theoretically the sequel which follows the events in this movie.    It's a mess; better just to watch them back to back instead of watching one a while ago and then watching the prequel or watch the second first and the first second.    The way they arranged it was a mess.

1435107683|5.0|Owl reminds me a bit of Winnie-the-Pooh as far as brains and personality go. I find him utterly delightful, despite not being very bright. This book actually contains five short stories, but my toddler never wants to stop at one, so we always read the whole thing. They include The Guest, which is the winter wind, that Owl thought might like to come in and warm up, but he thinks it is rather rude making a mess of his house and blowing snow everywhere. Strange Bumps are two mysterious bumps that appear beneath his blankets (from his feet) but disappear when he tries to look for them. Tear-Water Tea is Owl's way of venting his emotions, I suppose: He thinks about sad things like pencils that are too short to write with or books that cannot be read because pages have been torn out. He catches all his tears into a teapot and makes tea with them. Upstairs and Downstairs is a story where Owl is trying to check on his upstairs and downstairs at the same time and ends exhausted in the middle of his staircase (this one makes me think Owl has spent too much time alone at home). Owl and the Moon is a sweet story about how the moon is following Owl home and he insists she cannot come home with him because she will not fit through the door and he has no supper to offer her. But when the moon goes behind a cloud, Owl starts to miss her. Then she shines her light through his bedroom window, and he feels much better. I highly recommend.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Outstanding animated film; the script and the actor's dialog is superb. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and the rest of the cast are first rate.  Great film for children and adults.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|For all its considerable flaws, Universal's \\"Dracula\\" (1931) marks the birth of modern horror cinema. Technically, the famous Universal horror canon starts with early silent chillers like \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" (1925) and \\"The Cat and the Canary\\" (1927) -- both films are in the public domain and freely available on the Internet Archive, for anyone interested. \\"Dracula\\" represents a refinement of these earlier films' techniques, showcasing the unique European flavour inherent in all subsequent Universal horror productions. It also builds upon these earlier successes by adding sound as an integral part of the experience.<br /><br />Indeed, sound is a crucial element of \\"Dracula\\"'s success; imagine how diminished its impact would be without the exotic chill of Bela Lugosi's voice. Other, better \\"Dracula\\" adaptations exist, but they all lack the gravity of Lugosi's elegant, cadaverous performance. Here, the bats are on strings, opossums have taken over the crypts and the table lamps are shaded with ragged swatches of cardboard. You can either fall asleep or laugh at these flaws, but odds are good you'll never forget Lugosi's sonorous voice and piercing eyes.<br /><br />Despite stories of a troubled production, the first half hour of \\"Dracula\\" is faithful to the spirit, if not the letter, of Bram Stoker's original 1897 novel. Creepy, shadowy, filled with ominous skies and crumbling piles of ancient stone, this portion of the film generates a menace that is purely cinematic. It's once the film hits London that the measured pacing slows to a trot while the film takes on the trappings of a stage-bound parlour drama, occasionally assuaged by Lugosi's vampiric presence. Only at the conclusion does the film finally return to its other strengths: really big, spooky stone staircases and crypts.<br /><br />As with most Universal Monsters films, there are no fewer than three separate DVD editions available. Therefore, it's a buyer's market in judging which version you want to own. The [[ASIN:B000035Z3K 1999 DVD edition]] presents the film with fairly clean sound while the more recent [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS 75th Anniversary Edition]] and [[ASIN:B0001CNRLG Legacy Collection]] editions deliver improved picture quality and sequels, respectively. All editions enhance the viewing experience with documentaries, trailers and photo/poster galleries.<br /><br />For those of us who grew up with this version of \\"Dracula,\\" acquiring one of these sets is a no-brainer.

031261246X|3.0|I was very excited about Zero Day and purchased it the day it came out.  I respect and admire Mr Russinovich's work in the IT space.  He makes a point and sticks to it - we are exposed more every day as we progress towards a completely digital foundation in our personal life, work, and government.  However, I can't give this book more than three stars - it was unique and original at first, but within maybe 90-100 pages it quickly nose-dived into pulp even Dan Brown wouldn't write.    The first half of the book dives into techno chaos, IT administration, and hacker chatrooms that is brilliantly laid out and translated by the author and his protagonist, almost like a modern day Sherlock Holmes.  In other words, you don't need to be a technology admin to understand the flaw or the ramifications of exploiting the flaw - the possibilities almost seem endless, nerve-racking, and exciting all at the same time.  It really gets you thinking, mostly about checking bank statements to the penny :)  I'm thinking, this is really going somewhere...    ...and then, the second half of the book if where my suspension of disbelief plummeted and disappointment set in.  I don't want to ruin the story for the other readers, but to explain myself, I will say I was half-bored and half annoyed by the choice of villain(s), what they stood for.  I am not ignorant to the hatred against America in other parts of the world, nor the likelihood of another terrorist attack on our soil, but the theme and religious overtones were all too familiar - more like beating a dead horse.  And yes, I get it - these particular kind of terrorists could step up their game and take out their assaults in such a way that would be more devastating.  But I mean really - you couldn't come up with a more creative cast of villains with a different background and agenda, Mr. Russinovich?  When the the most wanted terrorist appeared for a cameo, I shut the light off and decided to pick the story up in the morning.  Thereare plenty of countries and organizations that hate Americans - tell us something we don't know.    All in all, I am happy I read Zero Day and would happily pass the book along to someone else looking for a light-entertaining vacation read.  I still consider the first half of the book to be solid and with that in mind, I look forward to Mr. Russinovich's next novel if he chooses to write another.
1400062071|4.0|I enjoyed Abide With Me.  It has a beautiful pace and took me back in time.  I would read other books by Elizabeth Strout.
1594202842|2.0|This book is not, as the author keeps repeatedly stating, about Chinese parenting, but about the Amy Chua style of parenting. It appears to consist of bullying to the nth degree. The author herself even describes her style as being \\"mean,\\" \\"a drill sergeant,\\" and using \\"coercion.\\" It involves getting into vociferously loud shouting matches in public, including one that caught the attention and mild intervention of a police officer (\\"Is everything all right here?\\").     Though I've often seen the follies of overly lax parenting, her book describes the follies of overly strict parenting.     Inexplicably enough, the author keeps up the steady stream of haranguing and verbal aggression and abuse, despite her own parents disagreeing with her, having a father who is a prime example of the follies of overly strict parenting (said father became estranged from his own parents and is a  successful professional), having a husband who is a prime example of the benefits of a more nurturing and positive style of parenting, having friends who ask her \\"Are you sure this isn't for yourself?,\\" and having a younger daughter who ultimately rebels so much that the author is forced to give up and let the daughter have her own choice and not play the violin, an instrument chosen by the mother without any input from the daughter, almost 24-7 to the exclusion of all else (which both daughters should have had in the first place in any case).     The author should investigate counseling sessions, perhaps including some for anger management and some therapy to figure out why she feels the need to keep playing the tyrant with her daughters (and even at one point with dogs that her family adopts). And perhaps the family would benefit from a year's worth of sessions with the Nanny of T.V. fame. All of this might not be enough, though, as she maintains a stubborn blindness to the folly of her parental style.     In sum, a readable book by a supremely misguided person. I'd recommend reading a library copy, but not buying one (good sales may well serve to further reinforce the author in believing that her way of parenting is right).
B000EQHHJW|5.0|I bought this DVD over all others because of the fine reviews. The reviewers were correct. An incredible cast and story absolutely shocking with great location scenary which I always prefer over most staged performances. The whole show is Ingvar Wixell with a couple great famous arias by the then young Pavarotti. My only complaint as always is not enough subtitles. This is a keeper.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I must have missed TSTM when they first appeared on the scene. Hearing this stuff for the first time recently...I am a huge fan. Great music with a spiritually uplifting tone. I recommend this and their previous album. Not a big fan of the freshman project but this is phenomenal.
B000050X31|5.0|I bought this for only one reason...to have an opera with Ms. Battle in it when she was in her prime. Very difficult to choose one Magic Flute over all the fine versions out there. But I found this thoroughly enjoyable and the sets by Hockney OK. I have never seen the Magic Flute and it is quite different from other operas and in fact does not even feel like an opera. More like a children's fairy tale musical with some fine arias. Yes worth it....but I will not watch it as many times as I do Don Giovanni or the Marriage of Figaro.
B00023B1LC|5.0|It was great! The DVD played well and we enjoyed the movie. We had purchased the set last year and the first movie had gotten damaged. We just wanted to replace it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is a great ensemble comedy, with well-defined characters and a healthy love of sending up just about every film & tv trope there is. The DVD set includes lots of great extras.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|I don't really understand why this film has received so much acclaim and almost won an Oscar. Technically, it is well crafted and edited. The film has a lean, cold look to it which perhaps is a perfect fit to the callous, unsympathetic characters that inhabit it. In the end (and during the whole film for that matter), I could care less for these people and it is hard to like a movie when you don't have anyone to root for or admire. If anything, it might provoke you to cancel your Facebook account.
B003FSTN52|5.0|This is one of the best shows out there.  I love the fact that this show deals with contemporary issues and lots of moral dilemmas.

Im happy with season 1 and cant wait for season 2...

B00475AYJQ|2.0|Man, I waited 4 years for this?  I loved the first book.  I though it was one of the most promising new fantasy series I had happened upon in years.  Mature, thoughtful, great writing yet totally entertaining.  This book, on the other hand, was wildly tedious.  The whole episode with the fairy was unbelievably boring.  The story became rambling and pointless.  No doubt the next book will be seriously awesome: if the next book turns out not to be the end I am dropping this series.  There was not one holy-**** moment to make the slog worthwhile.  Blah.

B0000262QW|5.0|It had been a good 25 years since I last heard this album in it's entirety, and how I let this happen is beyond comprehension. Every track is rich with an seamless interplay between the musicians. Sure, Chick Corea stands in front on most tracks, but there is no question that Stanley Clarke and Airto provide a perfect backbone, while Flora Purim and Joe Farrell move in and out, up and down, around and through the melodies laid down by Corea. There's not a weak track to be found.  If you don't own this album, buy it now, and if you do but made the mistake of forgetting about it( like me), pull it out and listen to it again. This is jazz at it's best---transcendent stuff.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|The movie follows the lives of multiple protagonists who all resort to violence to get what is necessary done. It's a cool flick. Really.

0756404738|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I was highly anticipating the release of The Wise Man's Fear after reading The Name of the Wind.     I am not a big reader, but I enjoy a good story in all forms - spoken, film, comics, books. This is a good story. The story revolves around the main character, Kvothe, and it helps that he is such a clever, interesting, believable character. I especially love how his flaws are fleshed out in the story. I personally hate it when characters come out angsty, or with flaws too blatant or unbelievable, or too stupid. It's very difficult creating character that drives the plot so well, and Rothfuss has created a characters and a world that you want to find out more about.     In response to some other reviewers, I do not believe there are any fillers or frustrating parts of the book at all. Quite the opposite, I think both The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear both excel in creating a world without superfluous description while continuing the plot at a good pace. A previous reviewer says it better than I.     \\"Many readers will no doubt be impatient at the amount of time Rothfuss spends describing seemingly unimportant side adventures of Kvothe's. The book is about how a man becomes a legend. What would seem to be the main storyline is just as incidental as all the rest. It's nice to have that main plot line running through the many hundreds of pages of his adventures, and it does give Kvothe's life a bit of a forward thrust. But that is not what the book is about. So if you read this series hoping to get a page turner as he chases down the Chandrian, then you may be disappointed.\\"    If you enjoyed the first book, then you will enjoy this one. If you didn't like the first one, then chances are you won't enjoy this one because it's more of the same great stuff. For those that enjoyed The Name of the Wind and did not enjoy this book may not have liked where the plot lead them. All I can claim is that I was not disappointed.    After finishing this second book in the supposed trilogy of the Kingkiller Chronicle, it makes me wonder how Rothfuss will wrap everything up in the third book. There's much left to be told. It almost seems like it would need a 4th book. I wouldn't mind if there was.     Highly anticipating The Door's of Stone.

B003Y5H50G|3.0|Have you ever been really intrigued by the concept of a film, but pretty much knew deep down that the movie would probably suck? That was my initial thought process going into Limitless. The concept of a drug (NZT) actually being able to unlock the maximum capacity of a person's brain with unlimited potential is extremely fascinating to me. Maybe it's because Bradley Cooper has mostly been in subpar films or the fact that Robert De Niro has been giving us \\"okay\\" to \\"what the hell happened to De Niro?\\" performances for over a decade, but trailers for Limitless just left you feeling empty like you knew ahead of time that they were going to blow it somehow. Surprisingly enough, Limitless isn't half as bad as expected and may be slightly better than you think.<br /><br />The camera work is probably the first thing you'll notice as the opening credits use a unique zoom-in technique that mostly has us traveling through the back windshield of a countless number of cars in the type of traffic you'd expect in New York. This zoom-in technique is used several times throughout the film and, to be honest, makes you a little nauseous. As intriguing as it was, it actually wound up making me feel like I was just trapped on a carousel stuck on full speed. The use of color was a nice touch, as well. Whenever somebody first used NZT, the world became brighter. It was like they were seeing the world through a new set of eyes. The choreography went on to stand out a few more times throughout the film, as well. When Eddie (Cooper) finally sits down to write his novel, letters begin to rain down from his ceiling. When he first starts the stock market game, he glances up at his ceiling at one point and the tiles begin flipping around as Eddie sees the stock market play out on his ceiling. Things like that were a nice touch to make what would otherwise be an ordinary scene more memorable.<br /><br />The cast seemed rather lukewarm though. Bradley Cooper seemed to give the strongest performance of the bunch, but that's probably because we spend the most time with his Eddie Morra character. Hearing Eddie's narrative throughout the film managed to add a bit more depth though. Hearing his thought process and him voicing how he felt helped add a little to the film and his character. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro were really disappointing though. Cornish was able to display fear in one scene and basically came off as indecisive the rest of the time while seemingly just going through the motions. Robert De Niro has one scene that's fairly memorable; the scene where his character, Carl Van Loon, gives his \\"don't make me your competition\\" speech. It honestly just seemed like De Niro was grossly misused the entire film while Van Loon felt like a watered down version of De Niro's Senator McLaughlin character in Machete without any sort of ridiculous fun injected into him.<br /><br />The film did seem a little slow to get the ball rolling, but is pretty decent once it picks up around the halfway point. Any film that gets the wheels turning in your head because of its concept or makes you think about what you'd do in their shoes while using this fictitious product isn't all bad, in my book. Films that make you think can be a good thing even if it's something entirely different from what's taking place on-screen. There is one scene involving blood that'll probably make you want to puke. If you were in Eddie's situation, you'd probably do the same thing. But in the meantime, it's really...REALLY disgusting.<br /><br />The biggest downfall for Limitless is that its concept is almost bigger than the rest of the film. The film is centered around this fantastic idea that doesn't seem to be fleshed out to its maximum potential. The final product though isn't all bad. With an intriguing storyline, a strong performance from Bradley Cooper, and some fairly captivating cinematography, Limitless comes off as an above average thriller that you won't feel entirely cheated onseeing that rainy day you decide to see it since nothing else looks good.e to see it since nothing else looks good.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book reads like a documentary with short vignettes that tell the tale of ruination and hope that are the main staple of zombie survival novels.  It wasn't about gore, but similar to popular Walking Dead show on AMC, this focused more on the human element of a worldwide zombie takeover.  Kudos to the author for coming up with something fresh!
142311339X|2.0|OK, well at least Rick Riordan has a good sense of humor in this book.  But... I'm not a fan.  While the plot is new, Riordan's style of constant, fast-paced adventure is not as new as the plot. However, it's not terribly awful.  The plot of this one itself still provides a good, fun read.  The biggest problem is the main characters- they're a bit weak.  Piper is almost like a Mary Sue (a writer's term for near-perfect, flawless characters).  Sure, she's a \\"klepto\\", but that doesn't really have a negative effect on her overall character. She's beautiful, powerful, etc etc etc.  Jason is a distant, underdeveloped character, also a bit too perfect.  Leo's not as bad as the former two, though, nearly likable - though he's an extremely cliché character type.    Overall, four stars for the plot.  Minus two for the characters.   I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series by the same author, but this one is nowhere near as good! A bit disappointing, but maybe still enjoyable.
B0012KVWRW|4.0|Ah, seemingly everyone's favorite space cowboys ...  It's amazing how many reviews are out there on this album.   So here's my two cents worth.    Released in 1972, the George Chkiantz produced \\"In Search of Space\\" (they clearly located inner space ...), found Hawkwind having undergone a series of personnel change with bassist John Crimble replaced by Amon Duul II alumni Dave Anderson and the band's former sound engineer Del Dettmar stepping in to replace guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton who had gone out on extended medical leave after a bad tab of acid found him during a performance at the Isle of Wight Festival.  The album also marked the start of the band's collaboration with poet Robert Calvert, sci-fi writer Michael Moorcraft, and the debut of 'interpretive' dancer Stacia whose significant contributions graced the album's back cover.  Beyond the personnel shakeups, the album itself had a troubled beginning.  Original recorded sessions took place at George Martin's AIR Studios, but were moved after the band's recording habits brought them into conflict with the studio staff (they reportedly tried to spike the studio staffs' drinks with LSD).   The album also brought the band into contact with poet and future band member Robert Calvert who contributed to the 24 page The Hawkwind Log insert found in the original album package.  Calvert's contributions made about as much sense as the rest of the album:  \\"The spacecraft Hawkwind was found by Captain RN Calvert of the Société Astronomæ (an international guild of creative artists dedicated in eternity to the discovery and demonstration of extra-terrestrial intelligence) on 8 July 1971 in the vicinity of Mare Librium near the South Pole.  The discovery of the Hawkwind has led to more wild speculation than any of the mysteries of space that we have so far encountered. The facts surrounding the discovery of this drifting two-dimensional spaceship have been so distorted by guesswork and rumour that any further attempts at assessment would only increase the density of the fog.\\"  So what to make of the results ?  Well, given the turmoil surrounding the band and their acid soaked existence, it was amazing they managed to actually record an album.  Similarly, the fact that some of these songs managed to incorporate moderately recognizable musical concepts such as rhythm and melody was equally impressive (anyone who didn't believe that need only check out the acoustic ballad 'We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago').  Still, Hawkwind fans seem on the fence with respect to this one with some holding it the highest esteem, others less impressed.  To my ears it was certainly better than the debut, but didn't reach the mythological heights hardcore fans hold it in.  I guess I'm trying to say it featured a mixture of hits and misses.      - Opening up with an ominous array of synthesizer and oscillator burps and belches, over the next 15 minutes 'You Shouldn't Do That' proved an Hawkwind oddity that somehow managed to combined some of the trippiest sounds you've ever heard (courtesy of Dik Mik and newcomer Del Dettmar) with a surprisingly funky beat (courtesy of new bassist Anderson and drummer Terry Ollis).  Even Turner's extended discordant sax wailing couldn't derail this one once it got going.  The bizarre refrain which seemed to be saying ''chip du lay\\" was almost hypnotic.   Picture an aural train wreck ...  this had the same kind of  fascination.  It's also a song you'll either love, or hate with a true passion.  No exceptions to the rule.   rating: ***** stars  - 'You Know You're Only Dreaming' started out with some surprisingly smooth harmony vocals, morphing into an ominous ballad full of squealing guitar feedback and synthesizer burps and then degenerating into an acid-fueled discordant jazz-rock jam session.  Hawkwind fans seem to adore this one, but it just doesn't do much for me.  rating: ** stars  - In spite of the goofy, sci-fi tinged lyrics and cheesy synthesizer sounds, 'Master of the Universe' showed these guys could actually play something akin to conventional hard rock.  Mind you, there was no way you'd mistake these guys for Deep Purple, Sabbath, or Zeppelin, but this was still a ballsy slice of hard rock.  Once again Turner's sax was a mild distraction (you kind of wondered if he actually knew how to play it, or was simply filling up space with a quirky array of sound effects), but given the song's pounding refrain Turner's contributions were't a big deal one way or the other.  A major surprise and quite enjoyable.    rating: **** stars  - Talk about an abrupt gear shift.  Out of the blue 'We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago' found the band shifting from one of their heaviest rock numbers to one of their prettiest folk-rock numbers.  Showcasing a beautiful and poignant lyric, shimmering acoustic twelve string guitars (with Dettmar's electronic sound effects scattered in the background), this was simply a showstopper.  Besides, how often can you use the adjective 'beautiful' with a Hawkwind tune ?   The album's biggest surprise and one of my favorite tracks.    rating: **** stars  - 'Adjust Me' found the band wasting vinyl grooves with needless and mindless improvised experimentation.  Imagine the soundtrack for a third rate stalker film and you know what to expect on this one.  Okay, I'll admit the speeded up vocal track repeating the title track 'adjust me' over and over again made me giggle.   I'm guessing in a live setting Stacia would have been in the spotlight while the band plugged away on this one.    rating: ** stars  - 'Children of the Sun' found Hawkwind returning to an acoustic folk mode.  With a strong, almost martial melody, once again, the results were surprisingly impressive and enjoyable; to my ears the song baring a modest resemblance to some of Pink Floyd's more melodic output.  By the way, that was meant as a compliment.  For cryin' out loud, as lead singer Brock seldom sounded as good and even Turner's flute sounded decent on this one.    rating: **** stars    As you can tell, I'm not a mega-Hawkwind fan, but this one was good enough to warrant further investigation into the band's extensive recording catalog.    \\"In Search of Space\\" track listing:  (side 1)  1.) You Shouldn't Do That   (Nik Turner - Dave Brock) - 15:42  2.) You Know You're Only Dreaming   (Dave Brock) - 6:38    (side 2)  1.) Master of the Universe   (Nik Turner - Dave Brock) - 6:17  2.) We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago - (Dave Brock) - 4:50  3.) Adjust Me   (Hawkwind) - 5:45  4.) Children of the Sun   (Nik Turner - Dave Anderson) - 3:21    No matter what you may think of the album itself, the Barney Bubbles designed die cut album cover was certainly cool.  In case anyone was interested, the blurred naked woman on the back cover was band 'dancer' Stacia.    For what it's worth, the album was re-mastered before being re-released in 1996.  Nothing wrong with that, except some of the original tracks were re-recorded with new vocals added.  The reissue also included three 'additional' tracks that weren't found on the original:    1.) 'Seven By Seven'   2.) 'Silver Machine'   3.) 'Born To Go' (live)    So ...  if you want to hear the original version you're stuck looking for a vinyl copy.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I wanted to get a headset for my husband to use with our PS3 which is in the living room, hooked up to a TV that is nearby our main TV.  I can now enjoy watching TV in that room at any volume while he can play any of his games at his own volume without either of us disturbing the other.<br /><br />I had been looking at about 3 different headsets, this being the only \\"corded\\" headset since most of those seemed too short in length for the normal viewing/sitting distance of a 55\\" tv and our couch.  I read on several reviews that the cord on this headset was 16' long which was ultimately my deciding factor as I'd rather get a well-reviewed and higher end corded headset than buying the lowest end of a wireless set.  I am not disappointed in this at all!  I hooked this up in less than 2 minutes and although instructions are listed to do so, I did not need to change any settings in the PS3 menu for the audio output.<br /><br />My husband has been raving about the quality of sound and the little nuances and extras he never heard while playing several of his games.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is the packaging which is that shape-conformed, heat sealed plastic that you need to use a box cutter or some seriously strong scissors to open.  I'm a huge fan of the \\"Frustration-Free\\" packaging that Amazon offers on some products!<br /><br />All in all, a good quality product that was easy to hook up, set up and use within minutes!
B002V091IO|4.0|This is a terribly funny, well written, well paced book.  Despite the humour, and the curious counterpoise of the earnest, gauche Emma against the confident, middle class, slacker Dexter, it feels authentic, and I'm not sure if it is just because it is as I remember the eighties and the nineties in London and Europe at a similar age.  The \\"will they -won't they\\" tension between the two characters is a bit contrived in a \\"sliding doors\\" kind of way, but it provides an excellent medium for the awkwardness and angst that so often accompanies persisting, but unfulfilled, love for someone who just isn't quite right.  Well worth the read.
006082543X|4.0|Neil Gaiman, Coraline: The Graphic Novel (HarperCollins, 2008)<br /><br />My main reaction to this book was utter confusion. Not because of the book itself, which I quite liked, but it's been a few years since I read Coraline, and Henry Selick's film version is a great deal fresher in my memory than Gaiman's novel. And so I got to the graphic novel, dug into it, and started wondering where all the little touches Selick had added to the film (which I must say I enjoyed just as much as the novel upon which it is based) had gone. Which probably says a lot more about Selick than it does about Gaiman, and a lot more about me than about Selick. Just be aware that Selick did add things to the movie, and those things aren't here (along with, understandably, a good deal of the original novel; this is a 186-page graphic adaptation, it's not going to be complete).<br /><br />I'm going to make an assumption here I probably shouldn't: that you have either read the original novel or seen the Henry Selick movie based upon it. If you haven't, go do so now. I'll wait.<br /><br />Okay, while we're waiting for the slowpokes, I do think you'll get more out of this if you've read (preferably) or seen (or both) the fuller version of the story. Not to say this isn't good, but let's face it, this is Neil Gaiman. There can never be too much Neil Gaiman, and given that, a fuller story is better. When you've read it, then, the draw of the graphic novel is Russell's illustrations, and my review is based not on the story itself (one can find out what I think about the story in my April 2004 review of the novel or my June 2009 review of the film, both of which also got four stars), but Russell's work here, which is of course the new bit. (Not to take anything away from Dave McKean, whose illustrations in the original novel were fantastic; McKean is one of my favorite illustrators, viz. my gushing review of Cages.)<br /><br />Every time I review some version of this, I come back to Gaiman's hypothesis in the novel's afterword that children will see it as an adventure novel, while adults will think of it as a horror story. The film version of it was unambiguous in that regard; it was horror all the way. Russell, I think, took Gaiman's idea more to heart, and while there's no doubt the illustrations in here are creepy, they're not the full-on horror assault Selick went for (and succeeded in achieving). There's more of the feel of the adventure tale in the graphic novel, and that's a good thing; Russell figured out how to correctly strike the balance. There was some streamlining done, of course, and you have to expect that something like this is going to be focusing primarily on the high points, and that's where Russell all the sudden gets interesting. Yes, there's the high-point focus, but instead of the usual \\"let's strip this down to the moralization\\", Russell's version of \\"high points\\" focuses on some of the murkier moral questions to be found in the tale, and I like that. I like it a great deal. (Though of course the moralization high point must win through at the end, or you'd have a fundamentally different product. But my point is that that's not ALL that's left of Coraline's moral quandary, as might have been the case with a lesser adaptation.) A more slapdash effort would have landed on someone's desk and been sent back with the dictum \\"more talking cat!\\" or something silly like that, but the adventure/horror nexus is not the only place Russell achieved balance. Bravo.<br /><br />This is good stuff indeed. Again, I'd tell you to read the book or see the film first and use this more as a companion piece, but a good one it is. ****that children will see it as an adventure novel, while adults will think of it as a horror story.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I distinctly remember thinking after seeing Empire, that Lucas was an exceptional movie-maker with very high standards.  This started to unravel with Return of the Jedi, when literally at the time of reading the synopsis going up the screen when I first saw the movie after release; I read that there was (alas) another death star being built. I remember thinking, \\"oh no, we've seen this before, why do we have to see this same thing again?\\". I remember feeling unsatisfied by return of the jedi, how cheap it felt compared to the first two amazing films. Then Lucas comes out with special editions that add CGI, which look ridiculous, like watching a video game. We then see in episode 1 that Lucas in order to avoid real human conflict, introduces droid armies to avoid having to make his movie like a real war. He then further ruins the franchise by making the clones CGI too as opposed to making the costume and having to deal with the hard-work of live action scenes.  More video game. I was a young lad when Star Wars came out, and I watched in the theatre when Han shot first and remembered thinking he was bad dude, but by the end of the movie he had changed. Watching Han shoot first, and watching Ben Kenobi cut the arm off of someone in the bar, did not make me crazy, nor any of my school friends. I knew the movie was make-believe, but it was fun to pretend.    In the end the sad truth is that George Lucas reached his pinnacle with Empire, and was never the same again. But why he has to completely ignore the brilliance of the first two movies by ignoring their proper restoration is puzzling. He is who he is today, a different man than he was when he made those first two films.  Maybe it's the divorce he went through back then has deeply effected him. Whatever the reason, we'll probably never get to see those first two movies in their original glory restored and that truly is a shame. Rev the video game up!
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Yes, yes, yes, we all know that Bush & Blair are war criminals, that the film industry has a leftist political agenda, and that Roman Polanski is a scoundrel.  Now that we've got the obvious out of the way you'll enjoy Polanski's clever thriller THE GHOST WRITER--a film with several twists and turns, some of them predictable, some of them not so predictable.  What totally delighted and surprised me were the performances of Pierce Brosnan as former Prime Minister Adam Lang and Ewan McGregor as the ghost writer assigned to help Lang pen his memoirs; I must confess I'm not much of a fan of either actor, but here Polanski brings out these guys' A games, with Brosnan as a petulant politician accused of war crimes, McGregor as a hack writer suddenly in way over his head.<br /><br />THE GHOST WRITER takes place primarily on a cold, windswept, and dreary island off of Martha's Vineyard, where Lang has established his own secure compound.  (Of course, we all know this isn't really Martha's Vineyard being filmed, as Polanski won't set foot in the States, which adds to my amusement, but I digress.)  The miserable conditions outside set the somber and surreal tone for the film, as McGregor's unnamed character starts to uncover the ugly truth about the ex-PM--which inevitably leads to personal danger for the ghost writer.  Throw in an affair with Lang's wife (a stimulating Olivia Williams) and now we've got a complex and multi-layered plot, culminating in an ending that had me envious of its cleverness.<br /><br />To be sure, THE GHOST WRITER meanders, and the google epiphany is just silly, but overall this is a taut, satisfying political thriller.  Kudos to Kim Cattrall, sporting an unreliabel Brit accent, as Lang's personal assistant.  Watching her I kept asking myself, \\"Is this the 'Sex In the City' MILF?\\"  To which I answered (as I talk to myself alot), \\"Can't be.  Performance is too solid.\\"  Cattrall is cultivated and uber sensuous, which further enhances this fun film.  Politics aside, this is a real treat for political thriller buffs.<br />--D.

Middle books/movies in a trilogy almost never live up to expectations.

B000TTRGUE|4.0|Okay, I have been using these mics for almost a year now, and wanted to wait until I had sufficient time to use and abuse them.  I play in a rowdy Irish folk/rock pub band, and these things have seen it all.  They have had drunks knock into them, they have been banged around loading and unloading them, they have had impact and have been jarred by guitar heastocks knocking into them, and I have to say they are a great, low-budget vocal performance mic.  They do great with low end and mid translation (perfect for Irish folk vocals), and they couldn't be built more sturdy!  These things are freakin' tanks!!!  On some songs I play low/tin whistles, and when we add a bit of reverb and chorus, it sounds like the whistle is being played in the grand canyon!!!!  No problem with loud shrill highs.  When we use them for micing bagpipes, they leave a lot to be desired, but hey, that's not why we bought them!  If you are a small time college band, or a solo performer on the cheap, and dont want to pay for a SM58 or 57, these are good to go.  Once you get out of the bar and into concert halls or amiptheators, then you can upgrade!!  Everything else is gravy!  Great mics, great price, especially around drunks!
1401309666|4.0|The Long Tail by Chris Anderson demonstrated how the market place is changing with regards to the infinite amount of products that can be purchased through online sources.  It has been a long standing rule that 80 percent of a company's profits come from 20 percent its products.  However, based on the research referenced in The Long Tail, online market places make the majority of their profit from 98 percent of their products.  Consumers are looking for specialty products and the only place to find them is online.  Many online market places are increasing their inventory to include niche products only to find more people selecting the niche product offerings.  Because online market places do not have to hold tangible inventory or rent self space, such as large retailers like Wal-Mart, they have the ability to expand their inventory selection to an indefinite amount.  Coincidently, online retailers are finding that there is large market for niche products.  The phenomena of the long tail occurs as consumers continue to purchase items in the online market where the drop off would normally occur if the products were sold through traditional outlets.      Anderson presented an interesting concept that is directly related to how the consumer market is changing.   He links the new concepts of marketing with some more traditional, \\"word of mouth\\" approaches.   As Anderson pointed out, there are consumers for almost anything that is offered online, however, the marketing and promotion of new products still needs to be directed toward the right demographics.      I thought this book was very applicable to the current market place and really illustrates how consumer markets are changing.  This rapid change has occurred over the last couple of years and only leads the reader to wonder how it is going to continue to change.  At times I thought the concepts were repetitive and lost interest, but overall I think it puts the current market place into perspective.

1591843790|4.0|At 'The Art of Marketing' Conference in Toronto, Guy Kawasaki enchanted his audience with charm and humorous anecdotes. Guy's easy-going nature and kernels of wisdom engaged me enough to pick up his book.    The symbolism behind the Kawasaki Swallowtail on the front cover initially left me wondering, 'Great; another author on Alchemy!' It started to feel like yet another book on sales manipulation techniques.     Reading further, I listened to Kawasaki explain that Enchantment entails winning people's Hearts, in an ethical manner, with transparency, openness, and trust -- similar to Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' being about the Golden Rule.    Aside from the jewels on marketing, persuasion, and trust, I valued Guy's suggestions on:  1. The need for 'Salient points' in marketing and sales  2. Digital etiquette with Push-Pull Social Media strategies  3. Actionable, relevant, timely, and usable outcomes   4. How to Resist Enchantment (the most important chapter, in my opinion).    While 'Enchantment' is my first Guy Kawasaki book, it has peaked my curiosity enough to read his 'Reality Check'.    If you're looking for a book with entertaining, short stories that teach and enchan...*ahem*... ENGAGE you ;), then, I'd highly recommend Guy's book for a fun read.

B0049P1VHS|3.0|I too, like many of the other reviewers have read the comics from issue 1 to 82 and own the 6 hardcover books. I also watched each episode as they aired in HD. As far as the show itself, I really like what they have done. I will never be one of these people who think that a graphic novel or book should be anything like what is made into tv/movies. This part of my review is for people who love the comics but have never seen the show. Look at this tv show as an alternate telling of the story. Kirkman himself wanted this show to be something that reading fans could watch and not know everything that is going to happen. Yes, there are only six episodes in the first season. This is all that AMC would green-light for the series' premiere season as it was not known at the time that the show would be as big a hit as it has turned out to be. I thought I was lucky and picked this season up for only 20 bucks so I felt that it was a good deal, price-wise, for a week one purchase.    However, now that I have gotten to watch it, I am horribly bummed... The production quality of these dvd's is beyond crap. I watched it on my pc monitor, 28\\" lcd, and the picture quality is beyond unacceptable. Out of the 250+ dvd's I own, this one takes the cake as the absolute worst picture quality of them all. Very pixelated and at times, people's hair looks fake as it was so blurry during motion, it looked as if it were a plastic wig. As a test, I downloaded the first episode in non-HD format and it was like night and day with what I am looking at with these dvd's. I have a couple friends who are waiting for the mail to deliver their copies and am hoping that this is a specific issue to my set that I can return and get one that isn't so bad.     As far as the extras go, that has made up some for the episode quality. There are a lot of neat behind the scenes featurettes and a decent interview with the cast and writers about what they were hoping to do with the show.     Overall I have to give this one 3 stars. This rating is for the total package. Five stars on the show/extras, one star for the quality of what I received.
0385339100|3.0|John Grisham is the master of lawyer/law firm related drama.  I don't like givng spoilers, so I will be very general.  This particular book does a great job keeping the reader on-edge because the main character, Patrick, is caught up in such a dilemma after embezzling a large sum of money from the Law Firm which previously employed him.  What strikes me as the most interesting aspect of this novel, is how Patrick is not your \\"model citizen,\\" he is a shady character, but you find yourself as the reader voting for him because he's likeable while being kniving.  What's more is how the people out to capture and reprimand Patrick are even worse, they are despicable!  So it's one of those \\"lesser of two evils\\" situations that Patrick is the hero because he's less bad than the others.  If you enjoy a main character who has a ruff edge to him, but still comes off as mostly benevolent, you will love this story.  Like all Josh Grisham novels, it's an easy read, and you will probably finish it inside 2 weeks.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Received quickly and in great condition.  Love this movie, we like alot of Bruce Willis movies and this was not a disappointment.  Although, we found that John Malkovich and his character was our absolute favorite.  We've already watched this movie a couple of times and we still love it and still laugh at the same parts.  If you are thinking of getting it, you won't be disapponted.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I've read a lot of fantasy books the past few years and have generally found that my favorite authors are dead or largely retired and I've had the luxury of plowing through series that others had to wait for with baited breath for each part to come out.  With Brian Sanderson's 'The Way of Kings' and Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller series, I'm in the waiting game now.  Both authors have the kind of thoughtful pacing, lyrical writing, and intelligent and beautiful world-building with complicated characters that I appreciate in a fantasy author.  Patrick's series is worth the wait.  Even though I love having a whole series ready to read before me, I'd rather wait a few years between books, if that's what it takes, for this author to write a trilogy this good.
B000002O1P|5.0|On he and the Heartbreakers previous venture [[ASIN:B00005ABKB Long After Dark]] we found the band beginning to add new elements into their sound this follow up,which took several years to finally get out to the public finds a total spin off into new directions for the band. With the Eurythmics now famed producer/musician Dave Stewart and veteran Robbie Robertson on tow for various co-production duties this album explores the maverick spirit of a young southerner in the mid 1980's-with the usual tales of girls,cars and good times but also some more personal commentary mixed in. The music takes on a similar approch with a largely sleek,new wave inflected soul/funk sound with strong horn puncuations and tight grooves along with the usual inventive and well crafted songwriting. Other elements of Southern styled pop music figures into the mix as well but in order to deal with that it's best to go song by song.<br /><br />  This particular album was released the same hear as Tom and the Heartbreakers provided session work for Dylan's [[ASIN:B0012GMYLY Empire Burlesque]] album and some of the rockier numbers on this album actually showcase that influence such as \\"Rebels\\",\\"Dogs On The Run\\" and of course the crawling countrified blues of \\"Spike\\". Even so these songs all have a certain kind of sleek flow to them and none of them have a very hard rhythmic and lead guitar punch to them. And that perfectly matches some of the other excellent songs on this album that have quite a different approch. \\"It Ain't Nothin' To Me\\" and \\"Mary's New Car\\" both emphasize a horn fueled,at times almost dissonant and jazzy (especially on the former) disco/funk sound which the Heartbreakers hadn't fully explored before. Many might try to tread lightly on that and call them 80's dance-rock tunes but..hey they are what they are and they groove so hard there's no shame for me to say it. \\"Make It Better (Forget About Me)\\" gives a go at a very South African pop sort of tune,a little before Paul Simon got in on this tip and a strong reminder of how similar that style is to many forms of Cajun/Zydeco music common in Southern American states. The country ballad title track explores abley the assumption many people have of people with Souther drawls being lower class and uneducated but how the character where's it proudly as a statement of individuality. The album ends with the more pychedelic styled piano ballad \\"The Best Of Everything\\" rounding out this powerful album.<br /><br />  For those who prefer the Heartbreakers in more of a rockier motif as opposed to a soulfunk,funkier groove based type of sound this album may take some getting used to. But generally speaking even for those highly phobic of 80's production values (and there seem to be all too many out there) this is one of those albums that has the ability to work very well in it's time as well as today. Because Tom Petty was reaching something of a musical peak that would culminate later in the decade as the caliber of his talents began to attract a wider and wider audience. And perhaps in anticipation of the direction of what's known as blue eyed soul or \\"rock n soul\\" during this time-a move generally towards a warmer and less coldly electronic sound this album is really very forward thinking in how it anticipates that,even if that wasn't quite the intention. Overall it's musically and lyrically one of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers finest and most creative releases and would add a lot to anyone with a strong collection of either 80's pop/rock,soul or heartland rock.uth African pop sort of tune,a little before Paul Simon got in on this tip and a strong reminder of how similar that style is to many forms of Cajun/Zydeco music common in Southern American states.

B000001AJO|5.0|This is one of the strongest CDs from Stevie Wonder.  It does not get the love it should, but he hit the bullseye on almost every song on this one.  Take a listen, and you will see!!!  A must have for fans of classic soul.
0670022411|5.0|This book was so hard to put down! It is like a more adult version of Twilight and Harry Potter weaved in with history.  It is a great read and I can't wait for the next one.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a fantastic cooler for the price.  To put it short, my i5 2500k was getting ~75C on load using prime95 and the stock cooler.  With this heat sink and 1 fan I am now getting temps of ~45C on load with prime95.  Amazing!  I should also mention that I did not use the included thermal paste because I had a tube of antec formula 5 lying around.  Seriously, you can't go wrong for ~$25.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|I love to listen to this on the way to work and on my drive home.  It helps to keep my thoughts positive before and after an often not so positive work day.  Highly recommend.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|This may not be their best, but after reading some of the reviews here, I went back and listened to all the cds on my IPOD.  I am not sure what people think REM does sound like or should sound like, but they have always been an eclectic bunch and this cd continues many of the sounds that they have previously explored, some better and some worse, but if you love or like or hate REM, this CD will probaly not move you from one category or another, but Stipe can make me cry or laugh and Buck makes me want to jangle along.

0393324818|5.0|In the present-day American society, we love to root for the underdog.  Whether it's movies (Slumdog Millionaire), sports (Butler's run in March Madness last year), or just everyday life, the American people tend to root for the little guy.  Michael Lewis' book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game is one of the greatest underdog stories of modern day.  Lewis directs the novel with remarkably charismatic prose and keeps the reader turning pages whilst a story of unheralded proportions leaks onto the pages.  From this book, I enjoyed the sections dealing with the history of statistics in baseball.  It really gave me, who, although I enjoy baseball, does not know the finer points of the statistics, a good basis on which Michael Lewis was trying to build the book.  However, this could be a problem for some, as if you do not enjoy sports in the slightest, might find this book dull.  With that said, I would still recommend this book to you because, if one steps back and ponders what is really being said, it applies to more than just sports.  Although technically a baseball book, Moneyball is a wonderful and insightful book.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|It's hard for me not to like anything that Springsteen does, but this CD set was a little Orbison-y for me.  If you're into that sound and you like Bruce, this would be an awesome CD for you.  I'm a little more into the Sprits, Backstreets, etc. type of sound (which I had convinced myself that this CD set was all about before I bought it), so I found that I was not that enamoured by many of the songs.  I do like the song The Promise and some of the other alternate takes of already-released songs though.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This processor is simply astounding.  Period.  I've run several benchmarks with it and have been totally satsified with the results.  Forget i7 950's or even the ridiculous 980X; this processor shreds them all in most apps.  It is also fairly energy efficient and is the OC champion of the day.  Seriously, overclocking this processor is as easy as changing the multiplier in the bios to whatever you want (mine is set at x44 giving me 4533MHz).  Add a decent cpu HSF and you can easily see 4.5-5.2 GHz on air!!  These 32Nm chips are seriously quick and the Ivy Bridge processors of later this year will fit in the 1155 socket.  Now is the time to get in on the Sandy Bridge bandwagon for sure!    Pors:  Amazing stock speeds with incredibly simple overclock ability/Energy efficient/Low temps/Next generation architecture/AMD who???    Cons:  None that I can think of...    Other notes:  Buy the less expensive i5 2500k if you do not plan on heavy video encoding etc.  The 2600k's feature set is pretty much useless for pure-gaming performance....
0061726826|5.0|I was debating on whether to read this book or not in the beginning but I bought it anyway for my Kindle & started reading it. Oh my god, I got hooked! This book is so interesting & different. It's really one of a kind reading experience! It's kind of like the books Matched by Ally Condie & the Ugly series by Scott Westerfeld in a similar sort of ways. I just finished reading the book, and I can not wait for the next book in the trilogy series to come out! The ending left me wanting to read more!!     I hardly leave any feed back on books (I do read a lot! & love most of my books I read..) but this book is worth the buy! Once you start reading it, you can't take your eyes off of it!     -Loyal Teen Fiction Reader! :)

B0007Y08QA|1.0|This movie is absolutely dreadful. My wife and I wanted to turn it off after 15 minutes, but I hung in there because of the stellar reviews on Amazon.     The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. This movie is a mystery with really bad awful clues to advance the story. The \\"twist\\" is such a let-down. I actually said, \\"Really?\\" when it was over.    Wow, so Christian Bale was grotesquely skinny. Big deal. Not worth buying just for that... we've seen him do this a few times, and word is that he's getting freakishly thin YET again for another movie, Concrete Island. Maybe that one will be better.

B003R0MF1C|5.0|Like so many others, I have watched Medium since day one and never missed a single episode.  It really was one of the best series ever to air on TV. I loved it. The cast was superb, the acting excellent and one of the most believable families ever portrayed.  You actually felt as though you were watching and getting to know a real family. I do miss them all. I experienced some of the most unexpectedly moving moments of all my many years of television watching during the run of this show.  For me there will not be another like it.  It's hard to find just the right combination of attraction and talent to relate to very often.  It's just too bad the average TV audience cannot appreciate something so wonderful.  I look forward to purchasing the final season.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a classic in my opinion. I am 69 years old and this is among my top 5 all time favorites! I will watch it over and over.    I couldn't find this movie any place else. Amazon came through and got it to me without delay.
1401309666|4.0|The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More was authored by Chris Anderson.  The book's overall purpose is that products that are not in high demand or that have a very low sales volume can together as group, compose of an entire market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, if the store or distribution channel is large enough.  Anderson uses specific examples, such as Google and Netflix, to show how his theory has already taken place and is able to illustrate how consumers purchasing habits have been shaped by the economics of big business and the blockbuster culture and ultimately this is because of the Internet since it allowed consumers to be more specific about what they wanted or look around further than they could have in the past.    Anderson's theory of the Long Tail in more detail is that the consumer's culture and economy is more and more shifting away from a focus on a small number of mainstream products and markets at the head of the demand curve and more towards a much larger number of specific niches in the tail.  Anderson argues that because the costs of production and distribution have dropped, mainly due to online capabilities, there is now less of a need to put consumers and products into the same grouping.  Anderson goes on to explain different aspects of Internet culture and business on the Internet and how it led to niche markets being exposed.  Anderson explains that by consumers having the ability to find specific things that interest them, large manufacturers and retailers no longer had the control over consumers like they used to for many years in the past.   I believe that Anderson is trying to say that the overall culture of buying is changing with the Internet.  Since consumers are no longer under control of the big business economics and the blockbuster culture, the consumer or buyer is able to look further into niches that he or she never knew existed previously.  With that said, I do think that the book is very well written and Anderson does provide good, solid examples to back up his theory.  However, I do think this book is one that became very repetitive by the end.  I can also see how some people would want to argue against Anderson, because in the book he is constantly telling the reader that things have changed and how consumers no longer have the same buying habits.  But this is true for other aspects of consumer's lives.  Additionally, Anderson just uses the examples of online information, and does not go into how his theory would apply to other industries so it probably would have been beneficial to use different example types.     With all this said, overall, I believe Anderson does do a good job in making his argument and getting his point across.  It is clear to see how his theory relates to the economy today.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this topic.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|My ABSOLUTE FAV since \\"Car Wheels...\\"  (and I own ALL her recordings [FYI: wasn't a big fan of \\"West\\"]).    It doesn't \\"rock out\\" like Car Wheels CD, but BLESSED (for me) is more profound + insightful.  Maybe the most profound group of songs I've EVER heard.  Lucinda continues to grow as a songwriter and a person; and we've all gotten older.  Thank God she's an artist who doesn't chase her past success \\"formulas.\\"    Some songs on BLESSED will shake you to the core or bring you to tears (E.G. \\"Soldier's Song\\" and \\"Kiss Like Your Kiss\\").  \\"BLESSED\\"  knocks my socks off, shatters me, and makes me want to write songs just as insightful: (in my book) Lucinda is a songwriter like no other.    I suggest getting the deluxe CD (The Kitchen tapes are worth it.)  I like both: studio versions AND the recordings she made in the kitchen.  I WANT BOTH!  Would I want a world with Neil Young recording \\"acoustic only\\" CDs ---or electric only?  Nah.  I like Neil doing both.  If you're a fan of Lucinda Williams I don't see how you can go wrong getting the deluxe.   And finally, a DELUXE CD that is actually worth it (not a deluxe CD where I pay 5 x-tra bucks for some silly fold out--I won't mention any band names.)  CONGRATULATIONS LUCINDA!  YOU DID IT!
B001V7WC1Q|4.0|I just watched this through Amazon's streaming video (for free!) and was pleasantly surprised. I read the book about a month ago, and immediately watched the American version - Let Me In. While I enjoyed the movie, I was disappointed that so much of the book was changed or left out. This adaptation really was much better. I thought it captured the tone of the book, and expanded on several of the secondary characters much more than the American adaptation.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews that the dubbing was not very good, but heck, it's what I expected. The actors are not speaking English, so it's not going to be perfect.

0385737955|2.0|1.  I didn't find the Grievers frightening at all.  They aren't smart, and they aren't fast ...    2.  Why didn't the 50 or so Gladers fight the Grievers early on, especially considering how many weapons they have, how easily Thomas kills one in the end, and how smart these kids are supposed to be?    3.  Why are kids the final hope for the world?  And why is this kind of asinine experiment necessary to try and find the best?  SO unbelievable.    4.  Why would the runners continue to run miles and miles each and every day when they know the walls' movements are just repeating???  That seems incredibly unrealistic.    5.  Some of the writing in the first couple chapters is ridiculously bad.  I'm not even going to waste more time on this book by going back to find examples for you.  Corny.  The best way I can describe it is as \\"socially awkward\\" writing.  It lacks finesse.  Some of the corniness continues throughout the book ... the kids make choices that don't fit.  They say things I can't imagine teens making.      6.  Why are there only boys?  Is there a Glade somewhere with just females?    As a high school teacher who spends most days with teens, this is not something I'd recommend, as I don't think it will ring true to my students.  They will find the flaws just as I did.  The more I think about it, the more I dislike the book.  The plot just doesn't make sense.  I love the premise.  I was totally excited for it.  I just don't think it works.  I'm greatly disappointed.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I first saw parts of this on tv one night as husband was flipping channels. I bought the book for my Kindle and loved that so much that I came back and bought this movie. I was very into the movie! I think the actors did a wonderful job. I am pretty sure that the author veered off the historical path a bit but, all in all, it was pretty accurate. If you love anything to do with King Henry VIII and that time period, you'll like this movie.
B004FEFZU2|2.0|First of all I'm not a fan of the series, I just bought this movie because it is one of the first ones to come out in bluray 3d format and I wanted to test my 3d compatible laptop.    My review is based on the 3d experience that I got out of this movie. This is not the first 3d movie I've played on my computer so I have other experiences that I can compare this one to. Now I gave it 2 stars because it seems like there is something wrong with the movie, it stutters. Not all the time, but in almost all the scenes when there is a camera (or angle) change, then I can notice like a flicker or a 1 sec lag (during the transition) and it is really annoying. Like I said I have tested other 3d movies (Alice in wonderland 3d, Imax Grand Canyon adventure) already and this is the only one that I have experienced this issue with. The 3d effect is not very impressive either, not a lot of pop out effect and even in some scenes not much depth effect.    Good thing is that you can play this title in 3d bluray, normal bluray, dvd and it also comes with access to an online digital version.    If you're a fan of the series you might definitely want to pick this one up (add it to your collection) and watch it in any of the preferred formats provided. If you're looking at it only for the 3d effect (like I was) then I would recommend skipping it and look for another one with better reviews (as far as the 3d effect goes).

0393338827|5.0|Micahel Lewis's \\"The Big Short\\" is a vast improvement on the roman a clef \\"Liar's Poker\\" that made him famous.<br />This recounting of the 2007 to 2008 sub-prime mortgage meltdown is packed with excellent detail and telling character portraits. Both the narrative and the research are solid.<br />But the biggest player in the big short, Paulson, is only a bit player in \\"The Big Short.\\" Perhaps because Paulson's story was being recounted in detail in Zuckerman's \\"The Greatest Trade Ever.\\"<br />Lewis's journalistic standards and writing have vastly improved. In addition his understanding of complex (read purposefully obfuscating) derivative contracts is evident, and his descriptions and explanations are fair and comprehensible. His self-editing and his editor's hand are evident in an improved product.<br />This is a gripping retrospective on the players of the meltdown. One caveat: it would have been nice if Lewis had included a closer chapter on Hank Greenberg and the meltdown of AIG, but perhaps the dopes who lost the game were too embarrassed to give him any interviews. Needless to say, the sucker's side of the story is only outlined and referred to here. Because the chump shut up.

0385732554|4.0|Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy, one the most influence personalities of the sixties, wanted to dictate what the public's memories of her husband were going to be. To do this she had to deviate from the truth. In an interview with Life magazine, Mrs. Kennedy used the term \\"Camelot\\" to describe her husband's Presidency. She did not want society to remember the true turmoil of his presidency, their relationships or the uncertainty of everyday life. She wanted to protect society from the untold pains, frustrations and disappointments they had experienced. She wanted President Kennedy to be remembered as a great leader over this utopian type of society. Maybe this is where LBJ coined his ideas of the \\"Great Society\\" but I will leave that for another paper. My point of this paper is to present the lies, oppression, and the unattainable and fictitious ideas of a perfect society. Lois Lowery's The Giver is an example of a Camelot-like society, an abstraction. Society based on ideas, that disregards and suppresses the natural events, truth.<br /><br />We wash the dirt, germs other things that are associated with an infection away, we do our best to isolate ourselves from receiving an infection. We associate infection with pain and disease. To prevent this pain and disease we do our best to sterilize our surroundings. This is what Lois Lowey has done with the setting in her story The Giver. She created a community that did not suffer the pains or diseases of daily life; the residents of this community did not experience hunger, sickness or desire. She had created a sterile society, free from pain, well almost free of pain. The only time pain occurred was when one fell from their bicycle. While there were other pains that were identified in the story, they were covered up, those pains were denied, they where not to be seen or discussed. This is evident when Lowery gives the reader a vivid description of the release process of an undesirable defenseless baby. They just washed the baby from their memory, they dispose of the perceived infection, the potential pain it could present if they chose to let the baby survive.<br /><br />What separates us from the other animals on this planet is our ability to reason, to think in the abstract. In this community that Lowery has depicted the population as having lost, or rather been prevented from, exercising their ability to think critically and analytically. The characters in the story show no emotion; they have planned ceremonies, instead of celebrations. These ceremonies are theatrically planned right down to when members of the community are supposed to clap. Nothing is emotional or spontaneous; every aspect of this community is scripted and staged. There was one group of people who were different, the ones who saw color. They were selected to be the holders of memories, the people who could reference the past and experience emotion, make decisions and be spontaneous. We see this several times throughout the story.  The character Rosemary shows the reader that there were members who do not follow the expectation of society. She was selected and expected to become the holder of memories however she decided that it was not for her and she exited the community. She actually committed suicide over the memories the Giver was training her with. This caused great turmoil in the community and the community was said to have suffered when she left, but there was no description of how it suffered or how anyone reacted. I would venture to say they experienced sadness, disappointment and felt betrayed. Since this was a sterile community that was not exposed to pain, suffering or even deviation from the proscribed path they were directed to take. When Rosemary left, everyone knew she killed herself, and the teachings she had been given were released into the society. It's not clear what that means, if the thoughts were telepathically rained down into the collective minds of the population but I think it means that they were then exposed to something unexpected.

The name was simple and given the time, when the musical was at the height of it's popularity, was the perfect name to use to give the people a name for a time period. The musical, a love story, portrays a perfect yet slightly flawed and tragic time.  Given Jacqueline Kennedy's background and education, she undoubtedly was keenly aware of the truth she was telling in using the phrase. Camelot, in the story that is not in the musical, is a place where wars were ended and peace reigned, where knights and nobleman sat together without fear. But the true story, one she would have studied, that was not in the popular conscience, was that the peace of Camelot was destructive and lead to death, debauchery, pain and suffering beyond compare. The trained knights were stuck at home with nothing to do. The infrastructure of the city nearly collapsed with having to support so many \\"happy\\" people. In the end, an adventure had to be created to give people something to do, something to look forward to; the people needed a goal, a dream to work towards, because without such a thing there is no hope and no reason to work hard and strive to be better. There's no reason to exist. The story of the legend of King Arthur's Camelot gives the knights the purpose in the search for the Holy Grail. They are then free to leave on their quest, freed from their life of perfect existence. Mrs. Kennedy's husband, and I'd argue her whole family, was given freedom from the pain, suffering and debauchery upon his death.

0385335997|5.0|we all knew it was a romance and adventure....so why be so critical of it ....her story still moves well and is punc. with surprises.  i found it just as fullfilling as the first two books.. with all the junk out these days its nice to travel in time with a little romance and intrigue.   what are books for?  its called FICTION!

B002N8A14M|5.0|I love my new iPod case!  The fact that it's clear is great because I can actually see that my iPod is purple.  So many others covered the color I chose!  It also seems to be pretty sturdy.  I've used both the case and the armband in a few distance running races and haven't had any problems.  The fact that the wheel is uncovered is a great asset because I can change the volume without taking it out of the case like I did with my last cover.  Others have mentioned having a problem with various headphones.  I haven't noticed this and I've used both the iPod headphones and a pair of Sony ones.
1439181780|5.0|When I first heard of this book, what crossed my mind was \\"what the hell is this really going to tell me?\\"  To my surprise, it really woke me up with my life.  I stop feeling any kind of Love for anything or anyone.  I have been searching for any kind of Love, through books, cd's, shows, etc... It was not till I sat down and started reading this book, did I realized that I do have Love, it was just that there was so much negativity in my life, that just overwhelmed my Love.  This book showed me how to replace it with Love and  not try to change it or fight it, but to just replace it with love.  I really recommand this book to everyone.  And I mean EVERYONE.  I feel they should make this book part of the school teaching.  Start teaching kids to put love in there life.
0316098337|1.0|I really shouldn't have wasted my time but I had a hard time believing it could be that bad if it made the MB shortlist.  I was wrong.  This book is so unbelievable and almost laughable when you read the diaglogue.  What was the author thinking?  Has she ever been around a five-year-old?  Are we to believe he didn't notice an airplane in the skylight until he was 5?!?  And that he is hyper-articulate at one moment and babbling in incomplete sentences like a two-year-old the next?  I just found the whole story unbelievable and boring.
B001MS7IBS|2.0|I'd love for this review to be a recommendation for an amazing show, because I really do count Fringe as one of my favorites. However, the horrible, shoddy work done by Warner Home Video for this release all but ruins that for me.<br /><br />Some things have become fairly standard for TV show DVD releases -- access to different episodes, settings and extras through a centralized menu. Often, it is possible to access different scenes and chapters through a sub-menu for each episode. None of this is present. The discs auto-play the first episode and to select another, you must use the \\"Pop Up Menu,\\" notably not available on all models of Blu Ray player (or often called something different if it is). The \\"Top Menu\\" option only shows the \\"extras\\" for the disc. Even the Pop Up menu access is limited, granting access to episodes, but not individual chapters. Worse yet, several of the \\"extras\\" fail to play, often depending on how you accessed that particular menu (through the Pop Up, or by selecting the Top Menu.)<br /><br />I realize that it is expensive for Warner Home Video to recall discs, but this sort of work is shamefully bad. I am going to seriously re-think purchasing anything from their television line at this point, unless I can verify that it has been handled with more care.
B001EN71CW|5.0|We stumbled across this series on Netflix, and after just 2 episodes decided we needed to own it! We absolutely love this series (and wish it had gone beyond one season). It takes a unique perspective on the future of space travel and what it is like to be struggling to make ends meet as odd-jobs outsiders that are almost always on the run and willing to do anything (legal or otherwise) to make ends meet! It is unique, it combines drama with humor with a bit of sci-fi and some really great characters! If you enjoy the series you need to check out \\"Serenity\\" the feature film created at the completion of the series, which is now one of my top 5 movies! It wraps things in the series up, and has some awesome action mixed with surprising twists! Must see!!
B003UESJHO|4.0|This is not just a boxer movie.  It is a story about two brothers, one of whom is a drug addict and a failed fighter, and the other, who has much more promise but must overcome his family's interference and opposition, especially as regards the woman he falls in love with and later marries.      There is a lot of profanity as well as a lot of bloody fighting which will put off some viewers.  However, the main storyline is compelling and it is based on a real family from Lowell, Massachusetts.      Mark Wahlberg, Melissa Leo, and Christian Bale are great in their roles here, as is Jack McGee.
B0047BXRB2|5.0|Forbidden Planet is a classic science fiction story and the DVD belongs in any collection which boasts a large portion of this genre. The foundation for series like \\"Star Trek\\" becomes obvious once the movie concludes and the viewer spends time thinking about the story line and the subtle message it conveys. I remembered this movie from when it first debuted and it has not lost any of its fascination. Highly recommended.
B001F6TXME|5.0|The only problem I've found w/ this product is, it's the wrong one. I searched for a remote for a Nikon D3000, and this is one of the products it showed in the search results, but it's not the correct plug type. Otherwise, I'm guessing it's a great product!
B001G9FFIQ|2.0|Just purchased a copy of this album (my favorite Metallica album) in vinyl, and I just have to say that is has been a big disappointment.  Of course, I mean the way the vinyl itself has been mastered/cut, not the actual Metallica compositions (again, is my favorite album of Metallica).      The vinyl has a LOT of surface noise.  Since the needle drops it is VERY noticeable, and ruins the listening experience.  The record itself has been mastered at a very LOW volume, which will need to pump up the amplifier in order to hear at a reasonable volume.  That would not be bad by itself if it would allow for some dynamic range (highs vs. lows)  but what actually happens is that every time the music goes to a silence (like between songs) the surface noise is heard vividly, and therefore I would NOT recommend purchasing it in this format.    I compared it to the original CD version, and it is way better to listen this way as the already-lacking bass sounds are  way more pronounced on the CD. In my opinion, the CD suffers from some minor clipping (specially on the bass drum), that I did not detect on the vinyl, but that's about the only \\"advantage\\" the LP provides.  Well, that and that you get the cover album (which I love) in a bigger format and the liner includes the same group photo shown on the CD but in color.  That's it.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|When Oasis spilt up in 2009 and Liam Gallagher decided to carry on without older brother and primary songwriter, Noel, many assumed his new project would be a disaster with second rate music.  Liam chose the band name Beady Eye and the lineup includes former Oasis members Andy Bell and Gem Archer with Chris Sharrock on drums.      Different Gear, Still Speeding is not only much better than any critic thought it would be, it's a strong debut album.  Liam and Co. aren't going to reinvent the wheel or come up with any new ground breaking musical style but they stick with what they are good at.  The album includes tracks with a 60's vibe as well as sounds of the earlier, better Oasis albums.  Different Gear, Still Speeding kicks off with \\"Four Letter Word\\" where Liam sings \\"nothing lasts forever.\\"  This isn't the only reference to the Oasis split or his relationship with Noel.      The album is written cohesively by Gallagher, Bell and Archer and the group sounds reenergized and focused on writing as a band and not all dictated by one person.  \\"Bring the Light\\" and \\"The Roller,\\" the first two singles, are straight forward, feel good rock `n' roll.  Liam's vocals are highlighted on the album and he seems to be taking things more seriously this time around.  \\"Millionaire\\" and \\"For Anyone\\" have a folk ballad vibe.  Liam has never been shy on his love and obsession for The Beatles and these themes echo throughout the entire record.  The album is a good mix of rock anthems and ballads and there are few, if any filler tracks.      The album closes strong with \\"The Beat Goes On\\" and \\"The Morning Son\\" which both discuss things coming to and end and then being reborn again.  Beady Eye deserve some credit for taking some risks but not straying too far what made them popular with Oasis in the first place.  It's an exciting debut album from a band that everyone assumed would be a joke and it ends up being a refreshing and complete British rock album.      -Tim Roberts
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Loved it. Was suggested to me by a man friend who read it when he was younger and was worried the material might be either to juvenile or boy-focused (he had not revisited the material in some time, and I think we can all agree that many times something that was amazing at 14 doesn't always retain its charm at 24). I can attest that it was neither. Very nicely written and produced a lot of emotions.
0525951652|5.0|Though most of the characters are not factual, Fall of Giants provides an insight into the causes of WWI and the introduction of Lennin and Hitler prior to WWII.  I really enjoyed it. As in other Follett books (Pillars of the Earth) it provides a look at what life was like in the time period of the book.  I am looking forward to the second book in the Century Trilogy.
B000YABYLA|1.0|Upon receiving my DVD (I already knew I liked this movie a lot, so that's not the problem), I discovered that the DVD wouldn't play in my Xbox.  I haven't been able to try it in any other devices yet but this is pretty disappointing since I typically use the Xbox to watch movies at home.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Marketed as an indie documentary about a mysterious facebook relationship, \\"Catfish\\" is actually a profound meditation on loneliness in the age of computer-assisted social networking. Nev (pronounced NEEV), the focus of this documentary, is a young, attractive photographer who is contacted via facebook by an 8 year-old girl who has painted a rendition of a photo of his that has appeared on the cover of a magazine. In rapid succession, Nev befriends, via facebook, the girl, her mother, her sister, and a group of their friends, all of whom live somewhere in Michigan. While in Colorado on a filming assignment, Nev, his brother and their friend (who are filming this documentary as well) begin to question the veracity of the emails and phone calls Nev has been receiving from this family. They rashly decide to go to Michigan to meet the family and get to the bottom of the mysterious facebook friendship that has blossomed. What they find is more poignant than shocking, and it will force you to confront the ways in which technology in the 21st century is ultimately powerless against genuine loneliness.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this unit to take long exposure photographs helding my camera still on a tripod. It will only work on bulb mode. You do not need to have the MC-DC2 shutter pressed all the time, just push it to hold mode, and go get beer and come back when you want (for as long as 30 min max I guess) and push it back, and you are set.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|A feudal Japanese warlord finds a lowly bandit who looks just like him, and rather than have him executed for his thieving presses him into service as a body double. However, when the warlord dies, the bandit has to take over the spot full-time lest their little mini-empire get invaded and collapse. Intrigue ensues...<br /><br />This is a fantastic historical piece, with great costumes and sets. The performances are also top-notch. Of course, one of the great features of any Kurosawa flick is his masterful cinematography, and it's abundantly on display here. This film is a treat for the brain and the eye.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|I passed this up because the description seemed just BORING.  Fortunately it was recommended to me and I took a chance on it.  I am really glad I watched it.  Great acting (except maybe by the wife), the cast was wonderful and it had lots of plot twists.  Best movie I have seen in a long time.
B004JAUCQE|2.0|Now- Not So Much. Just Plain Boring And Out Dated Sounding. The Record Sounds Fake And Pathetic- And Not in A Good Way Either!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|It has been over 20 years since I saw this movie and still find it fun to watch! Completely immersed in 80's wardrobe and styles, but the story is timeless!  The main characters come across as everyday people and the story line seems reasonable. Still love the ending allowing the viewer to decide where things go after the tournament. Too bad sequels were made ... this movie easily does well on its own.
B002GHHHPQ|2.0|I loved this movie when I watch it before but for some reason someone cut out some of the best parts. I guess I will just keep on the shelf.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|A quality DVD presentation enhanced by blue-ray technology makes this a very special video. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who may have been considering purchasing this extremely entertaining PBS special.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|After watching some really great crime dramas over the past few years, e.g. The Sopranos, The Shield, The Wire, I can say that Breaking Bad builds on the tradition of the shows that came before, and exceeds them in many ways. This is a cinematic show with visibly high production value, creative camera angles, and beautiful cinematography (the cactus and sand of the New Mexico desert are palpable in 1080p) rarely seen on TV. Cranston and Paul as the two leads are spectacularly talented professionals (3 consecutive Emmys for Cranston, 1 for Paul) that make one of the most memorable odd couple partners in crime in TV/film history, taking the \\"fish out of water\\" motif to shocking new levels of intensity. Great photography and stellar acting aside, the story lines in Breaking Bad are spellbinding, and Gilligan really excels at putting his characters in impossible situations and making the audience squirm as we wonder how things could have gone so horribly wrong. Complex, dark, intelligent, and beautifully shot, Breaking Bad is the best show on TV right now.
B000001EXR|5.0|As a 48-year-old KISS fan who's been listening since I was 13, I've always been somewhat frustrated by the band's musical insecurity - at their worst, they can't seem to stop second-guessing what the music-buying public wants to hear.  Their very best albums - \\"KISS,\\" \\"Alive!,\\" \\"Destroyer,\\" \\"Creatures of the Night,\\" \\"Revenge,\\" \\"Unplugged,\\" and \\"Carnival of Souls\\" - all seem to come from times in their career, where all they wanted to accomplish on vinyl was To Be Great.  When they put aside their desire to Be Popular, they really can do that.    \\"Carnival of Souls\\" was one of the great ones.  It's \\"the Other KISS,\\" the one we never quite got before and wouldn't hear from again, but it's a great album.  Sadly, Paul and Gene have sort-of disowned the album in recent years, describing it as a musical misstep, but in the book \\"KISS: Behind the Mask\\" (which you really should read BTW), Gene is probably more honest when he says, \\"At that point.... we went... forget everything. Let's try to make a home for Eric (Singer) and Bruce (Kulick). To me it was a very brave record and I have no regrets.\\"    And I think that's the honest core of this album.  It is musically the most well-crafted, and lyrically the most mature album they have EVER produced.  No lyrics about groupie sex this time around - for once we really get to hear something of what these men have been thinking about!  The musical arrangements are challenging (in a good way) and there really are no fillers in here - how often can you say THAT about a KISS album?  How many KISS albums embarrass you (even just slightly) with a Gene Simmons track that you just KNOW popped into his head because he thought of a \\"cool title\\" and then he slammed three chords together until it reached the 3-minute mark?  None of that here.    \\"Tell me what you want me to be - I can't stand myself anymore.  Tell me what you want me to see - I  can't find my way off the floor.  Truth is like a hurricane.  I think it's gonna rain.....\\"    When was the last time you heard words like that from the Starchild?  But it absolutely kills.    This was the KISS album I had waited half my life for, in a way - not necessarily for the pseudo-grungy edge it had, but for the musical chops and lyrical sincerity that was so often lacking in their other offerings.  And I have to admit, I was just a little bummed when they went back and did the makeup reunion thing - don't get me wrong, we all had a GREAT time of it while it lasted - but I was a little sorry they didn't stay the course musically.    I was just getting to know them as grown artists, and then we were back to leering at Christine.  It was great and all, I get it - but \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a real testament to what these four talented men can do when they stop caring whether or not it will sell.    Give it shot.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|If you are checking this out you probably know who & what Calexico is.  If you don't check this out [...]  This along with \\"Feast of Wire\\" are my favorite albums they have created.  Unforgetable lyrics & great music.  Wow!
0345410025|5.0|My grandfather used methods like this.  When my father was in school, these methods were falling out of fashion.  A pity, as they work.  In the time of Shakespeare- 200 years before encyclopedias, or dictionaries, 50 foreign languages were taught, in London.  How?  Trained memories.  There were people who could listen to a 3 hour play, go home, and write it out word for word from memory.  Once since WW II have books been relatively cheap.  Traditionally, books were memorized.  Buddhist priests were expected to memorize quite a bit.  Take the book, [[ASIN:145648320X The Rhyming Tao Te Ching, and other Oriental wisdom in rhyme: Over 70 ways to easily access peace of mind, wisdom, and awareness]].  I love the Tao Te Ching, but most translations have no meter, they are hard to memorize.  Put a little meter in, and some rhyme, and you have ...  song lyrics.  Many people can memorize songs.  I have memorized passages of foreign languages, using Lorayne's methods.  The meat of this book is about 20 pages, the rest is all application.  I learned the method in one night, in desperation, when I was 4 units behind in a language class.  I caught up, and stayed 3-5 lessons ahead, from then on.  Lorayne's book on how to be a good student is even better, though it came out after I graduates.  This is a classic book, one to give to any college student.  Easy to read.  And if you master the method, you start getting flashes of photographic memory.  I memorized all my notes, and notes from readings, in college.  I could easily have gone another hour writing, after exam time ended, and would have enjoyed it.  I gave out 10 copies of this book, to friends, in college, once I had mastered it.
0780622650|1.0|This movie stinks like a 400 year old hot dog in a dump. The story is just as dumb as the WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 PPV. The writing is just as bad as the writing from TNA Impact. The Acting is just as bad as the acting from Ready to Rumble. The effects are ok. The movie is also even boring like William Hurt's acting. It's not very imaginative at all. One of the worst films of the 1990's I give this film a 1 out of 10.
B003UESJHY|4.0|Very solid film. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't absolutely blow me away as a film but Christian Bale was phenomenal and Mark Wahlberg/Rachel Adams gave a very solid performance as well. Could watch this one a few times.
0756404738|3.0|For those of us that read the first book in this series, the wait for the second one seemed to take forever.  Partially because the release date kept getting pushed back, but mostly because The Name of the Wind had been SOO good it was tough to wait.  I got Wise Man's Fear and attacked it hungrily.  I was actually happy when I got the book and saw that it contained about 1,000 pages.  Unfortunately, it almost seems like all of that would've easily fit into 100 pages with room to spare.      I think the whole book only covered about one term in the University for young Kvothe and a pretty uneventful one at that.  Not sure what happened with this story.  (Spoiler here) Between the romp with the fairy godmother, the long and unsuccessful fight training and the seemingly pointless trip, I was left rather deflated and unsatisfied.  I won't say that I've given up on this series. I'll probably pick up a paperback version of the last entry and give it another go, but this one left me with a sour taste in my mouth since it should have been so much more.
B00005221M|3.0|Director's ext. cut 3 stars - When this first came out in '92,I was appalled at the changes to the novel but over the years, I learned to love the film despite its' rewrite. This was on AMC a few weeks ago and I caught it at its' end so I thought, what the hey, why not buy it. It's a rich, lush movie with a wonderful romance. Except I was wrong in my memory, having purchased the VHS copy to get the original release. I hadn't realized how little interaction there is between Alice and Uncas. It's so lacking that motivation of certain actions are left up in the air for the viewer to figure out and really, if you aren't familiar with the novel (which still isn't right), it isn't easy to get. It just seems that it was clearer in the theatrical version why Alice did what Alice. I hadn't realized what a weak simpleton her character is. There is little to show the attraction between she and Uncas. Hawkeye and Cora, on the other hand, have it going on and it would be great love story were it not, well, no spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen another version or read the book. Another issue I have is the age of Madeleine Stowe.  I love Stowe, she's so naturally beautiful but she was also too old for this role. In 1757, a 34 yr old woman would not only be married with many bairns but might be a grandmother.    1992 theatrical version - 4 stars, due to it not being true to the novel. Not that it has to be exact but the changes are significant. Still a good movie and if you can overlook the changes better than I could, a 5 star movie, especially if you are unfamiliar with the novel.
B00364K6YW|4.0|The film quality is definitely better in this restored edition, most noticeably in the color.  However, in at least two places, the video has some sounds that are a defect, sort of like a high-pitched squeal.  The mistaken sounds don't last long, but certainly reveal a flaw in the recording process. I need to return the videos and request new ones.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Love it love it love it!!! Such an eclectic mix of music. In a time where all new music sounds the SAME to me, this was definitely the touch our music scene of 2011 needed. I will be buying all Mumford and Sons albums from here on out.  This album is great if you want to just relax and chill out, have something sentimental to listen to if the need strikes, or to just jump around and pretend like you play the fiddle if thats what floats your boat also. Something to have playing in the background to set that perfect mood.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No spoilers here! :) The author does a wonderful job of enveloping you into her world. There's a little more than a hint of sci-fi to it, and you can really believe and picture what's going on around the characters. If you love strong female protagonists and a bit of sci-fi, you will LOVE this book!! The best part? There are 2 more to follow. Buy this book, you'll love it!!
0307454541|3.0|It begins with a bang setting the tone for a very interesting political novel due to firm views of the author, a Swedish anti-nazi, anti-racist liberal, then it progresses as a crime novel with a whodunnit frame and ends closing a loop with the beginning. Although it is well written, has good character development and the plot exhibits some interesting twist and turns some events have been grossly contrived in a a way far fetched and full of fantasy to fit the plot snugly with the ending the author had in mind, employing hackneyed tricks of the trade abused by many average crime novel authors. The setting of the novel goes a little in urban Stockholm but most of the events unfold in the Swedish countryside. It carries an outstading translation from the Swedish language into English featuring a neat polished prose. This book is the first of a set of three called the milennium series and I am willing to read the other two.
B002HMHROQ|5.0|The Blue Mask from 1982 has passed the test of time with flying hues of blue. The varied material takes the listener from domestic bliss on My House which is also a tribute to the poet [[ASIN:0811206807 Delmore Schwarz]] (\\"I've really got a lucky life/My writing, my motorcycle and my wife\\") and the long, slow rumination titled Women, to extreme panic and paranoia (\\"I cringe at my terror/I hate my own smell/I know where I must be/I must be in hell\\") on Waves Of Fear.<br /><br />Musically, the first four tracks follow a mid- or down-tempo rock ballad pattern. Then, the feedback on the title track introduces a maelstrom of edgy drumming, roaring and squalling guitars and Reed's intense delivery of a dark, oedipal rant about punishment and pain. There's up-tempo driving rock on Average Guy, a majestic melodious wall of sound of Waves of Fear, a tender, yearning ballad about John Kennedy and the tuneful, stirring love song Heavenly Arms.<br /><br />This album revisits many of the themes that had inspired Reed from the start of his career with the [[ASIN:B000002G7C Velvet Underground]]: His mentor, Delmore Schwartz is invoked on the opening track, reminding the listener of the Velvets' European Son (to Delmore), while Underneath The Bottle, a harrowing account of a struggle with alcohol, brings to mind an earlier song The Power Of Positive Drinking from the album [[ASIN:B00004TQSH Growing Up In Public]], whilst the beautiful Heavenly Arms with its gorgeous cascading vocals is not too far removed from Satellite Of Love on [[ASIN:B000026F8S Transformer]].<br /><br />The approach is different, however: gone is the decadent, sometimes snarling narrator of the demi-monde, and instead Reed turns into an essayist or reporter writing and singing with admirable maturity but still passionately about subjects as diverse as women, gun violence and the day John Kennedy died.<br /><br />The guitars of Reed and Quine, the bass and the drums work perfectly together, whether on the slow numbers or on the more intense rockers like Waves of Fear or the title track.

B0031RAOVY|4.0|For any animal lover this is the sadest movie I have ever seen, if it was a made up story it would have been easier but knowing this was based on a true story- we were sobbing. I can cry just thinking about this movie, animals have such an innocence about them and watching them emotionally suffer is heartbreaking.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|I recently went on a hunt to find the best version of the Tchaikovsky symphonies. I listened to versions by Slatkin, Karajan, Haitink, Muti, Abbado, Mravinsky, and Jansons. I found the least convincing to be the Abbado and the Karajan. Karajan conducts in an older style that I can hardly tolerate anymore, romantic and excessive with rarely a steady tempo to be found. The Haitink sounded great but was often too slow, with the exception of his version of the 4th Symphony which I thought was one of the best. If you want a version that makes your blood boil, go with Mravinsky, though for me his style is also a bit old. The versions by Slatkin and Muti had a kinship in precision. Theirs were the most precisely controlled of all of them and I would rate them quite high, with Slatkin edging ahead. But better than all of them...much to my surprise...was the Pletnev. First, the recording quality was fantastic.  In audio quality alone it was the best, with the Slatkin neck-and-neck. Pletnev's style is modern and free of pointless romantic excess. He doesn't need to rush the tempo of the exciting parts because he starts out with a quick enough pace to make that unnecessary. The stylistic touches are minimal, but where they exist they are precise and appropriate. Of All the conductors listed above, Pletnev was the only one who trusted Tchaikovsky. All the others felt as if they had to add something to the score, as if it was their job to make it exciting because Tchaikovsky hadn't made it exciting enough, or perhaps over-indulging themselves as prima dona's. Pletnev has none of this. The music is as written and with just enough stylistic flourishes to accentuate phrasing. There are some legendary versions among those I listened to when searching for the best Tchaikovsky symphonies, but to my ears and heart Pletnev beats them all without breaking a sweat.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|Lara Lington has always had an overactive imagination, but suddenly that imagination seems to be in overdrive. Normal professional twenty-something young women don't get visited by ghosts. Or do they?<br /><br />When the spirit of Lara's great-aunt Sadie-a feisty, demanding girl with firm ideas about fashion, love, and the right way to dance-mysteriously appears, she has one last request: Lara must find a missing necklace that had been in Sadie's possession for more than seventy-five years, and Sadie cannot rest without it. Lara, on the other hand, has a number of ongoing distractions. Her best friend and business partner has run off to Goa, her start-up company is floundering, and she's just been dumped by the \\"perfect\\" man.<br /><br />Sadie, however, could care less.<br /><br />Lara and Sadie make a hilarious sparring duo, and at first it seems as though they have nothing in common. But as the mission to find Sadie's necklace leads to...<br /><br />my review:<br />While I liked the first couple of the Shopaholic series, they became a bit redundant. And I never warmed to any of her other books. But it a fit of desperation during last month's horrifying reading slump, I was perusing Target and decided a light chick-lit might help. I read the whole book that day. Then, alas, went back to my reading slump.<br />Twenties Girl wasn't bad, it had it's moments. I enjoyed the relationship between Lara and Sadie, reminding us the our elders have stories and aren't just people to be pushed away to die. Of course, Lara doesn't discover this until Sadie is dead but she is lucky enough to get a second chance.<br />Though it has some predictability, it was still an enjoyable read, light with some mystery, romance, and touching moments.<br /><br />my rating in it's chick-lit genre 4/5
0618918248|2.0|As a Christian, I began reading The God Delusion with a certain amount of trepidation that my faith might be substantively challenged. I have concluded the book with the contrary perspective that my faith has been substantively strengthened. If this book represents the best arguments from one of the brightest minds, then Christianity has nothing to fear from atheistic secular humanism. Dawkins has been referred to as Darwin's bulldog, but Darwin's pussy cat might be a more accurate appellation - for his arguments lack any teeth. I expected a scientist like Dawkins to provide conclusive facts and proofs in support of his position. Instead, what I encountered were a slew of opinions, theories, and fallacious arguments. By fallacious arguments, I mean that virtually all of his arguments exhibited one or more fallacies in structure or content - fallacies that almost anyone could spot. The worst fallacies in the book are in the categories of faulty generalizations (cherry picking, composition, false analogy, circular reasoning and hasty generalization), red herring fallacies (including straw man, argument from silence, association fallacy, and chronological snobbery), propositional fallacies (existential fallacy and proof by example) and most commonly, the fallacy of judgmental language. (You can look at the list of fallacies in wikipedia and find a good number of them represented in Dawkins' book). Dawkins argues religion against science and uses specific instances from not only across all of Christendom, but across all religions in the world, and generalizes the specific instances to be representative of religion in general. He refers to anyone who agrees with him as enlightened, intelligent, thinking, reasonable, etc., and all (including some specific distinguished scientists) who disagree with him as ignorant, delusional, unreasonable, unthinking, abusive, dangerous, etc. etc. Regardless of whether he is right or wrong, Dawkins has been rendered irrelevant by fellowatheists Foucault, Derrida and Rorty.  2-Stars because Christians should read the book to help understand the atheistic secular humanist mindset.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|Eilis Lacey is given the opportunity to go and work in Brooklyn as there are no jobs available in Ireland circa,1950's. Her older sister Rosie arranges it with a visiting priest and Eilis is off to America, though homesick for her family. Eilis gets a job at a department store and Father Flood gets her into Brooklyn College to take bookeeping and accounting which Eilis loves and helps her keep her busy and less homesick. She meets a man, Tony and they begin a sweet relationship, though Eilis is uncertain if she can see the same future together that Tony does. Then a family tragedy strikes and Eilis heads home to Ireland and must decide if her future lies there or back in America.<br />my review: It has been several days since I finished this book, but I still am uncertain what I think. I had a hard time warming up to Eilis as she is a bit distant. I liked the Brooklyn setting in 1950's and the novel has some interesting characters. But this is a steady, safe story. Even though Eilis is Irish and her boyfriend Tony Italian, not a lot is made of this, though I think it would be an issue in 1950 for immigrants. The department store where Eilis works begins to cater a bit to blacks that are moving into the neighborhood, but again this is downplayed.<br />The relationship between Eilis and Tony is awkward at times, as I was uncertain how she really felt about him. Even the family tragedy that happens near the end is low-key.<br />But the ending, that left me thinking that I never knew anything about Eilis.<br /><br />This wasn't a bad book and it didn't take long to read it. But I felt that I didn't always know the point of it. It had a lot of potential that was unrealized. But Colm Toibin seems to be a well-respected writer and his books are loved by the critics. So maybe it was just me, or maybe it was just this book. I'd love to hear from other bloggers that have read this!<br /><br />my rating 3/5

0061726826|5.0|It took me a long time to really get into this book. I thought it was slow at first with a fair amount of useless pratter. But then that makes me think, was that Lauren Oliver's plan all along, really? To lull you into a sense of complete and utter boredom that by the time you're face with an opportunity for change and excitement, you're practically starved for it? Whatever the case maybe, by about half way into the book I started to find myself needing to know what happened next. I could feel the fever starting to set it...    Lena is your average teenager looking forward to the day when she receives the \\"cure\\" from the deliria known as Amor Deliria Nervosa. For to love is to hurt and eventually die. Or so they say. But when faced with a life without love of any kind, wouldn't you prefer to die? Which then kind of proves their point that love leads to death, because most people would rather kill themselves then receive the cure. And they do. And just before Lena is about to be cured, she does the unthinkable: she falls in love, joins the resistance, and partakes in general things that are otherwise considered a \\"no-no.\\"     By the end of the book, I had begun to ache for Lena. She has set out to fulfil a dangerous and painful destiny all in the name of love. It certainly makes you appreciate the freedom with which we take for granted. But what if one day that was threatened to be taken away from you? It's the same question that befalls Lena: What would you do for love?    Favourite line: \\"I love you. Remember. They can't take it away.\\"
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I liked the movie, though yes there were a lot of cliches in evidence. Yes there were some scenes that seemed ripped right of other war movies (re-arming scene at the end looked just like in Blackhawk Down, driving the APC down the tunnels running over aliens (right out of Aliens), etc).    I would have liked a little more character development, but not a ton more. It's a war/action movie, and we don't need to know every little detail about the characters. The movie was an action flick, and on that it delivered.    There were fewer than usual errors in military tactics and equipment, though I caught a few.    1) Copperhead artillery rounds that home in on laser designated targets don't look like that, and they move much faster. The enemy drones would probably not been able to intercept them/run into them. Plus they were fired one at a time, wherein in real life a simultaneous salvo would have been fired.    2) It would have been nice to have seen some civilians/cops fighting back. There's plenty of guns in LA; I would even expect to see some drug gangs fighting back when aliens came onto their turf. YES they would most likely lose, but at least show the civilians being a factor in defending the city instead of totally useless.    3) The squad was bunched up pretty badly at several points; a well placed enemy grenade-equivalent or missile would have taken them all down at once.    4) Concerning the rearming scene at the end: Directors please take note that military ammo is issued in 120-round bandoliers and the ammo is in 10-rd stripper clips with \\"spoons\\" to reload magazines. It's NOT issued loose; it takes too much time to load that way.    It was surprising that the movie did not try to shove the producer's political leanings down my throat as so many movies out of Hollyweird do nowadays. Even more surprising was a movie that portrayed the US Military as the good guys, and not stupid rednecks or bumbling tools of some evil mega-corporation.    DEAR GOD get rid ofthe darn shaky cam. It's overused, and it REALLY detracts from enjoying the film. It makes it really hard to follow the action. Give me a picture that's easy to follow and one that I can try to focus on various aspects of the action rather than trying to keep from vomiting due to the jerky picture. This was a big factor in my giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5.    Even with it's faults, I'd see it again, and when it comes out in Blu-Ray it'll have a proud place next to my copy of Blackhawk Down.

B0042RJWTM|3.0|\\"Nobody gets to be a cowboy forever\\"<br /><br />There are no more Indians to fight and no more towns to build. The Iron Horse swallowed up the wagon trains and the accountants from back East ate up the small ranchers. The day of the cowboy is coming to an end. Monte Walsh and his comrades see the setting of the sun, but where can they go? How will the west end? With a bang or a whimper? In \\"the Wild Bunch\\" (1969) the men decide to go out in a blaze of glory. This is their solution to the end of the west. The 1970 film \\"Monte Walsh\\" offers a different solution.<br /><br />Monte Walsh stars Lee Marvin, Jeanne Moreau and Jack Palance and was based on the Jack Schaefer (\\"Shane\\") novel of the same name.<br /><br />Lee Marvin (1924-87) gave us 4 decades of tough guys, from \\"The Big Heat\\" (1953) and \\"The Wild One\\" (1953) to \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" (1962) and \\"The Killers\\" (1964) to \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" (1967) and \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" (1968) to \\"The Big Red One\\" (1980) and his final film \\"Delta Force\\" (1986). Along the way he picked up an Oscar for \\"Cat Ballou\\" (1965). Most of Marvin's films were westerns, so he was a great choice about the end of the west.<br /><br />Jack Palance (1919-2006) was everybody's favorite bad guy, with riveting performances in like \\"Shane\\" (1952), \\"Sudden Fear\\" (1952) and \\"The Silver Chalice\\" (1954). In 1957 he won an Emmy for \\"Requiem for a Heavyweight\\" and in 1992 he won an Oscar for \\"City Slickers\\". Palance plays Marvin's long time friend.<br /><br />French star Jeanne Moreau (1928 - ) appears as Walsh's love interest. One of France's leading actresses, she appeared in more than 100 films, the most notable of which are \\"Jules and Jim\\" (1962) and \\"The Lovers\\" (1958).<br /><br />Jim Davis (1909-1981) had such a distinctive deep and throaty voice. He's probably best known for his years on the TV series \\"Dallas\\" although he appeared on dozens of other TV shows and more than 50 films, most of them westerns. Just prior to this film he had been a regular on \\"Daniel Boone\\" and \\"Death Valley Days\\". Davis plays a small rancher who has been forced to manage a horse ranch for an Eastern company.<br /><br />G.D. Spradlin (1920 - ) could easily play a President (\\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\"), a Preacher (\\"Ed Wood\\"), a General (\\"The Lords of Discipline\\") or a Senator (\\"Godfather Part 2\\"). His sharp voice and chiseled features were appealing on TV and in films. Spradlin plays one of the cowboys<br /><br />Bo Hopkins (1942 - ) was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah in films like \\"The Wild Bunch\\" (1969), \\"The Killer Elite\\" and \\"The Getaway\\" where he played psychopathic killers. In 1995 he won a Golden Boot for his contributions to western films. Hopkins plays a cowboy.<br /><br />Michael Conrad (1925-83) is best known for his Emmy winning performances on \\"Hill Street Blues\\" (1981-3). He was primarily a TV actor, but made a dozen films including \\"They Shoot Horses Don't They?\\" (1969) and his most famous role as the coach in \\"the Longest Yard\\" (1974). Conrad plays a cowboy.<br /><br />William Fraker (1923-2010) directs. Fraker was primarily a cinematographer for which he received 5 Oscar nominations (\\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\", \\"Heaven can Wait\\", \\"1941\\", \\"War Games\\", Murphy's Romance\\") although I think his camera work on Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt\\" (1968) was his best film. This was Fraker's first film as a director. He had worked with Marvin as a cinematographer in \\"Paint Your Wagon\\"<br /><br />1970 was an average year for films. The top box office went to \\"Love Story\\", \\"Airport\\", \\"MASH\\", \\"Patton\\", and \\"The Aristocrats.\\" The big Oscar winner was \\"Patton\\" (Picture, Director, Actor). Other notable films from that year were \\"Woodstock\\", \\"Little Big Man\\", \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", \\"Five Easy Pieces\\", \\"Diary of a Mad Housewife\\",  \\"The Boys in the Band\\", and \\"Husbands\\". Several westerns came out in 1970 - Howard Hawks'  \\"Rio Lobo\\", Sam Peckinpah's \\"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\\",  \\"The Cheyenne Social Club\\" with Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda, \\"Chisum\\" with John Wayne, \\"A Man Called Horse\\" with Richard Harris, \\"Soldier Blue\\" with Candice Bergen, and Don Siegel's \\"Two Mules for Sister Sara\\".<br /><br />Reviews were mixed. Roger Ebert called it \\"lovely\\" and said \\"the performances are extraordinary\\". Vincent Canby, on the other hand, said it was \\"not a very good movie, but one that is often appealing in its individual parts\\" and praised Palance and Moreau. Toni Mastroianni (Cleveland Press) called it \\"Will Penny without the class \\".<br /><br />The film was remade in 2003 with Tom Selleck as Monte Walsh and Keith Carradine in the Jack Palance part. Isabella Rossellini plays the Jeanne Moreau part.<br /><br />Whether or not you'll enjoy Monet Walsh is probably a function of how you want to see the era of the comboy. Fans of \\"The Wild Bunch\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", both of which deal with this issue, will probably not find much to enjoy in Monte Walsh.

B001KZVQJI|3.0|I watched the Extended Version with my family last night on Blu-ray.  Effects and sound quality  and visual effects are great it is a good film but not the best Kong film made.   The effects dominate the movie over the story and in the end make this less than a classic rendition of a classic story.  What would have made this a five start film and a classic for all times would have been better focus on the story which goes deeper than the \\"Beauty Killed the Beast\\" theme that does stand out.  The Skull Island sequences could have been about 25 minutes shorter so that 25 minutes could have been used to develop the story better. Most of that part shows the men out to save the girl getting beat up many more times than needed.  The story is not about the men looking for the girl, yet there are five separate moments where the men get run over, charged at, swallowed alive, and swarmed by bugs. All nice if the point of the story was to highlight how hard it is to save a girl.  But since it takes so long to get through the Skull Island portion, other important theme development gets a short shift.  As soon as the ape is subdued, we fast forward to opening night of his performance in New York. So much is left out from this point forward. The fact that the girl refused to play the role of the sacrifice at Kong's opening in New York is only briefly mentioned as if an afterthought. Why did she refuse?  Of course we all know because we know the story, but it is still important and gets completely left out. The older versions of this movie spent the time to make the audience feel the emotional attachment between the girl and the ape. They were allowed to feel the irony that while they should hate the ape, instead they feel for the ape and instead see that humans are the real evil.  That is the story.  But Cameron leaves all that in the dust and what we are left with is a visually stunning and special effects driven feature film that is very shallow and superficial.   If the specialeffects were anything less than stunning, this film would have been a campy failure.  But because the effects are so darn good, this film gets by with the over the top gore and the poorly told story. It is a shame because this good movie could have been so much more.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|As a psychic/medium (voted the Number 1 Psychic for 2011 by \\"The Long Island Press\\"), I think Hollywood is ten years behind the times with this movie.  Near death/going to the light experiences are not new news.  There have been countless books over the last few decades dealing with this topic.  As for psychics and mediums, even we are becoming mainstream, as more and more people are on a spiritual quest and seeking our services. \\"The New York Times\\" bestseller list has had many \\"hereafter-type books\\" represented there, and so, I felt that this movie seemed already dated before it even hit the theaters.

B0045U9WPU|4.0|I read this months ago and I still don't really know how I feel about Delirium. The idea of love being a disease is just so... odd. I appreciated the tidbits of information from the all mighty book in the beginning of the chapters. It helped me to understand why these people thought love may be a disease. But to have a cure for love? It just seemed so wrong. Okay in all honesty, it kinda made me angry.<br /><br />Delirium was off to a slow start, for me at least. I grew to like Hana who was daring and a rebel over Lena who always wanted to play by the rules. But I guess when your mother is where she is because of deliria it forces you to play by the rules. I did like Lena's character. She was very real and throughout the whole book. By the middle of the book I was hooked. I could feel my hands start to sweat and my heart race when reading about every time Lena snuck out. Wondering if she'd see Alex or not. Alex! Oh Alex. He was a wonderful character. I simply adored him. I loved the way their friendship bloomed, all the things he introduced Lena to. You could see the change in her and the whole time you're urging her to make the right choice.<br /><br />The ending was beautiful. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be that. I can't really explain it further but that was the first word that came to mind when I clicked next on my Kindle and realized the book was finished (that sounds so wrong). I absolutely can not wait to see what Lena's next adventure will be!

This movie captured a time when women were not taken seriously. Well, Penny, showed them what a woman was capable of taken on: the good ole boys of horse racing. The back drop of her daughter becoming a hippie and a war protester added so much honesty to the times when the great horse ran like lightening and taught the world what true greatness was all about.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|The music and animation are lovely.  Most characters are well voiced and well developed.  Tiana is endearing, Prince Naveen is (in his non-frog form) quite attractive.<br />I won't be buying this one for my 6 year old princess loving niece (yet) because the villains and voodoo are a little too dark for her to handle.  Many six year olds would do fine, but she barely makes it through the Little Mermaid and Ursula and I don't know that she can can handle the \\"friends from the other side.\\"  Just be prepared if your child scares easily.<br />I wish that the first African-American princess had had a little more human air-time.  I wish the beginning scene wasn't one that showed the African-American family working for a white family.  The scenes of Tiana watching the houses fade from Lottie's fancy neighborhood to her own humble one was sad to watch.  Even more sad was the scene watching Tiana and her mom move to the back of the trolley....  I wish Disney had suspended a little reality there....  Or set it in another time.<br />However, I did love that it was an American tale, and I am pleased that we finally have the first African-American princess; I cannot wait for another.

I feel an emptiness now that I've finished it and can assume no other novel will live up to the adventure it was to read this story.  As I neared the end of the book I could feel the emotions starting to bubble up but didn't realize until I could no longer see the words on the page that I was crying.  Not for sadness, happiness or anything easily explanable - simply emotion.

Hey, I like to take my time.<br /><br />One thing you should know is that these are great songs to take a walk outside to with headphones and walking stereo....I can't help but dance while I'm walking......to some of these songs, they are great.  His father went on record as of late to reporters stating that he liked his new deeper more matured voice...........I like his old voice.......but I never thought of it as either deep or high...just wonderful.<br /><br />As far as the reviews on here stating part of the dvd is in MONO.......and that the curse words are *BLEEPED* out, well, if you have followed his career you will know that he has been through a lot, and has always been a bit of a smart *BLEEP*, and so I think this is just his way of stating that for the record, he's gone away from that image...<br />and of course, the people that complained about it, didn't get it.<br /><br />I can see where it would be annoying to hear *bleeps* but I think he's trying to say something by doing this.<br /><br />He is more mature now.<br /><br />I doubt you will see him getting nekkid and holding his family jewels anymore...........<br />or writing anymore too suggestive lyrics........\<br /><br />His new work is great too...I don't like the song Bodies, but the rest of them are great, especially the new song on Take That's Progressive album KIDZ that he wrote (so I hear).......I shall get that album also.
B002PJ8BE6|4.0|The very fact that this recording was made at all is a cause for celebration. The 2004 \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" was declared by EMI to be the last commercial recording of its kind; henceforth opera would be available only on DVD's of live performances - but here we are with a brand new \\"Madama Butterfly\\" performed by a top-rate cast and conductor. When he became the Royal Opera's Music Director in 2002, Pappano vowed to make recordings only with his resident forces, but being a pragmatist and no prima donna of the old school, he sensibly compromised his principles when the opportunity arose to make this recording in Rome. Given that an opera recording can incur costs approaching half a million pounds, it made sense to integrate the recording into the annual schedule of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. Overheads such as the hall, the recording studio and the orchestra itself were thus absorbed within the Accademia's budget and the project became commercially viable. Furthermore, the timing was right: had the current financial crisis hit earlier, or the recording schedule been delayed, one wonders if it would ever have got off the ground.<br /><br />So we have every reason to cheer and hope that so risky a venture as a new, complete, opera recording proves financially succesful. I feel a certain pressure on me as a reviewer to be as positive as possible about this set - and, thankfully, that's not too hard. The indications are all good: the reigning EMI house diva Angela Gheorghiu has a particular affinity with Puccini; her voice has just the right plangency and morbidezza for his heroines. She has not sung the rôle on stage - but then, neither had Mirella Freni when she made her seminal version with Karajan - and indeed, she never did perform it live. German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is one of the two or three most sought-after on the circuit, with a voice of the kind of heft that is all too rare today. Antonio Pappano is proving to be the most dependable and successful of conductors; despite being only in mid-career he has already made a dozen opera recordings at a time when most conductors can only dream of so doing. Finally, the idea of returning a major Puccini recording to the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia has a nostalgic as well as a practical appeal: they were responsible for legion top-quality recordings in the 50's.<br /><br />So can I be sufficiently positive about this recording? Yes; but with some qualifications. Let's start with the obvious: the sound is spectacularly good; spacious, warm, and superior to any previous set - so much so that there is quite a lot of extraneous noise, especially if one listens through headphones: creaks, thumps, groans and cars accelerating all form a sonic underlay, so acute are the microphones. Balances are very good and the virtuosity of Pappano's orchestra is there for all to hear; there is energy and attack in plenty, in combination with some lovely gradation of dynamics. Little details and subtleties emerge under Pappano's direction; he has clearly re-thought the score and brought his customary zest to bear. Karajan's reading - my main reference point for comparison - is often longer breathed and grander, and the sound a little more plush, less pointed - but I haven't heard many complaints about either his conducting or the technical quality of the Decca recording.<br /><br />\\"Madama Butterfly\\" must stand or fall by the quality of its two principals, but I'll deal with the supporting cast first. All are more than adequate, yet each is bettered elsewhere. I have always thought that Robert Kerns's Sharpless, in the Karajan set, has been unfairly criticised for dullness; he has a pleasant voice and responds both wisely and sympathetically to the caddish Pinkerton's self-inflicted predicament. He is no Gobbi, whose nuanced vocalisation, apart from some strain in the upper reaches of his range, is near ideal in the 1954 recording conducted by Gavazzeni. Compared with both of these, Fabio Capitanucci is a bit of a bellower; he has a nice voice but little subtlety. As Suzuki, Enkelejda Shkosi is a little wobbly and matronly compared with Christa Ludwig, though her Flower Duet with Gheorghiu goes very well. Similarly, Cristina Reale's Kate reveals too much wobble in her few phrases. Gregory Bonfatti's Goro has one of those \\"cutting edge\\" character tenors which can grate on the ear; I much prefer Michel S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's silky insolence in the Karajan. Raymond Aceto's Bonzo is simply unacceptable; his uningratiating tone is as bad as I had remembered (from his Capellio in \\"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\\"); give me Marius Rintzler's noble sound any day. The chorus is excellent, especially the ladies accompanying Butterfly as they ascend the hill.<br /><br />Now to the raison d'être of this set: Gheorghiu's Butterfly. As with her recordings of \\"La Rondine\\" and \\"Tosca\\", both made before she had sung the parts on stage, this is her first essay at this most demanding of lyric-spinto rôles - although you would never guess it. She really lives the part and certain moments are unforgettably realised: the searing, surging despair of her \\"Ah! m'ha scordata?\\", the lovely, liquid portamenti in the love duet, the heart-rending cries of \\"Morta!\\" in \\"Sai cos'ebbe cuore\\" - as Sharpless observes, \\"Quanta piet&agrave;\\" indeed; she never fails to move. Even without quite having the vocal resources of some of her illustrious vocal forebears, she manages triumphantly the transition from fragile teenager to heart-broken wife and mother to tragic heroine. She cannot emulate the unearthly beauty of Mirella Freni's floated D-flat in the entrance aria - Gheorghiu's is not ideally steady - but she does almost everything else admirably. Her fans will want this set for her performance alone. (There is one puzzling little oddity, given the obvious time and trouble expended on this recording: Gheorghiu fluffs the words at the beginning of Act 2, saying \\"Perch&egrave; rispose\\" instead of \\"dispone\\". A negligible error - but why not re-take?)<br /><br />Finally, to Jonas Kaufmann's Pinkerton - and for me, here's the rub. I have greatly admired his singing, both live and on disc, although I was far less enthusiastic than some about his singing of the classic Italian tenor rôles on his recital disc; it seems to me that his timbre is far better suited to Weber, Wagner and Bizet's Don Jos&eacute; and I hear nothing here to change my mind. I miss the smile in the voice, the Italianate gleam, the seamless legato of a true Puccini tenor like Pavarotti in his prime. Kaufmann's hefty, baritonal sound is certainly thrilling and there is every justification for characterising the cruel, feckless Pinkerton as a bit of a brute. This, apparently, was Kaufmann's conception of Pinkerton as \\"cold, calculating\\"; it both suits his voice and exlains why, according to reports, both Gheorghiu and Pappano were urging him to greater passion in the love music, but it robs Pinkerton of an essential vocal allure and the audience of any chance of suspending their condemnation of an essentially unattractive anti-hero. You have to believe that Pinkerton, as a \\"Yankee vagabondo\\", temporarily believes his own lies while he is serenading his new child-wife. In addition, I am perturbed by Kaufmann's apparent acquisition of a new vocal bad habit: he repeatedly injects little glottal sobs into what should be a seamless sound. Presumably he does this for emotive effect but too much of \\"les larmes dans la voix\\" becomes a tiresome tic. The top of his voice, although often thrilling, does not expand or caress in the manner of singes such as Bergonzi or Bj&ouml;rling, thus the climactic B-flat of \\"America for ever\\" is uncomfortable, the pianissimi can turn husky, and too many high notes are approached with that little bleat which disrupts the line. I still much enjoyed listening to his virile, impassioned sound, but I found his portrayal of Pinkerton a tad two-dimensional, and I hope that he will not let the glottal habit take root in his voice.<br /><br />The packaging of this set is a \\"2CD Limited Edition deluxe clamshell, [with] 152pp booklet, libretto, synopsis, liner notes, [and] photos\\". In other words, beautifully presented - although the way the booklet rattles inside the over-large box is a bit irritating. Coincidentally, this year sees the 150th anniversary of Puccini's birth; this new recording certainly does him honour it but will not replace the Karajan in my loyalties.ut why not re-take?)

159420229X|5.0|In addition to delving into the bizarre culture of memory competition, Joshua Foer introduces the reader to an enchanting world of characters. HM, EP, S, and Kim Peek are four characters in the story whose lives were highly impacted by their atypical memory abilities/disorders, including retrograde amnesia and savantism; they are considered beyond a scientific lens, instead in a highly personal manner, that relates effectively how agonizingly unique their ordinary experiences must have seemed given their problems.<br /><br />Beyond encounters with these patients of memory impairment, an array of eccentric characters are interleaved through out the story: Ed Cooke, a binge-drinking, mnemonic apotheosis, who acts as Joshua's coach through out his journey; Daniel \\"Brainman\\" Tammet, a hyperpolyglot and genius whose differing depictions of the same number cast doubt on the uniqueness of his savantlike condition; Tony Buzan, a professor and marketing extraordinaire of exotic memory techniques like mind mapping. The narrative offers a great number of unforgettable characters.<br /><br />The author goes to incredible lengths to discuss the techniques mnemonic vetereans use to master their craft, including the method of loci, the construction of memory palaces based off of real life architecture, and the use of the most random imaginings to function as memory devices (where the title comes from). Sprinkled through out the text is a nostalgic realization of how undervalued memory improvement has become, and how grossly misunderstood the actual science is. The book casts a cynical eye on the abundance of self-help, opportunistic mnemonics literature currently on the market; in stark contrast to many of those books, Joshua takes the reader along with him as he trains for the U.S. Memory Competition. His real life participation in the event, accompanied by an impressive background of the science, distances mnemonics from the pseudoscience it has come to represent. By discussingthe origins of memory in Ancient Greece, the evolution of memory strengthening through poetry and oral tradition, and an elaborate explanation of the tricks used by competitors in memory events, the narrative succeeds in tapping into the rich but unappreciated world of memorization.

B004GCJ11C|5.0|I've spent years trying to be healthy and lose weight, and spent all that time focusing on the wrong things. Crazy Sexy Diet lays out the basics: what food is healthy, what food is not, and WHY these things are true. Instead of throwing a ton of medical jargon at you, though, Kris Carr does a fantastic job of lightening the whole thing up. She makes jokes, she makes the information easy to understand, and the book is incredibly easy to read. Besides, anyone who can make an entire chapter about bathroom habits easy to read is already a winner as far as I'm concerned!

0307408833|2.0|I was so excited to get my hands on this book, but was majorly disappointed once I did and sadly discovered the recipes are not very practical.    Many of the ingredients are hard to find.  Many ingredients are expensive, but with this type of product, I understood that going in.  I was able to make one recipe and it was not good.  At all.  I'm a baker and know what I'm doing and was, again, majorly disappointed.    Reading the FAQ's on their site and looking at the book, I think (MY opinion) there was such a demand for their product and they haphazardly put this cookbook together.  I've not had their products from the store, but if I was there, I would go.  I do believe they are more than likely very good.  Cookbook?  Not good.  Not practical.

I think this movie is best seen on the big screen to be able to appreciate the absolutely amazing colors, the action and the charm of it.  I was hypnotized as I exprienced this adventure with such joy.  Rapunzul is so sweet, the horse is hysterical.  I adored the scene where the little girls braided Rapunzul's hair.  So much hair!!!

B00338QENI|5.0|No matter who you are, there is one fact of life you will escape only at the end of life: You have a body and things will go wrong with it.  And because of that, you will probably come into contact with the medical establishment at some point during your lifetime.  If you've taken this fact and all it implies for granted in the past, reading this book should at least make you think more seriously about what it can and does mean to you to trust not only in the skills of your doctors but their ethics as well.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman who died of a particularly virulent form of cervical cancer.  During the course of a radiation treatment, her doctor cut some cells from her cervix and sent them to be cultured.  He did not ask Henrietta for permission to do this or even tell her or her family that he'd done it.  It was 1951, and there had never been any serious discussion of the ethics of collecting biological samples, or of the patients' rights regarding the disposition of those samples.  That the doctor never really expected her cell line to survive doesn't matter; he did something that had the potential for unforeseen results.  And as it happened, Henrietta's cancer cells did survive.  They were the first human cell line to survive in the lab, and they not only thrived, they multiplied at an astounding rate.  The line was named HeLa and as soon as it was clear that these were strong, viable human cells, researchers began to share them with one another.  Before long, Henrietta's cells were all over the world being used in studies not only of cancer, but other diseases, being sent into space and exposed to the effects of a nuclear explosion. Henrietta's cells outlived Henrietta; they were referred to as \\"immortal.\\"<br /><br />Science writer, Rebecca Skloot had read about these immortal cells in school, and determined to find out more about the woman from whom they'd come.  She made contact with Henrietta's family -- husband David and four living, adult children -- and was met with active hostility.  The Lacks family had only found out about the cells decades after Henrietta's death. Since then, their desire to know the details of her illness and death had been met with evasion, condescension, lies and even attempts to scam them.  It took a long time to win enough of their trust to begin to work with them, but Skloot persevered. She did her homework, she learned a great deal, not only about the medical standards and practices of the post-war era, but about the vast inequities of medical care with regard to race.  When she was finally able to speak to the family, she was prepared to help them wade through the morass of information about Henrietta and her immortal cells. I doubt much could have prepared her for the mistrust and misinformation she dealt with, but Skloot remains utterly non-judgmental.  She no apologist for either side, but rather and in spite of her obvious affection for Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, a dispassionate eye, reporting facts without prejudice in either direction.  She allows the players to speak for themselves in their true voices, and by doing so, allows them to explain who they are and what their concerns are.<br /><br />I suspect this book is going to raise a lot of strong emotions in its readers.  There will inevitably be anger at the abuses, both real and perceived, by the medical and scientific communities.  Some will be justified, some displaced anger over the current state of care in this country, and some just flat-out based on a lack of understanding.  There will be people who judge the Lacks for their lack of education and the (often understandable) paranoia about the motivations of people who are concerned with Henrietta's cells.  Some will be as paranoid as the family itself.  But what Skloot set out to do -- show us who Henrietta Lacks was and what her gift to the world has been -- is the one message all readers should take from this book.  Once we lose sightof someone's humanity, once they become to us nothing more than a disease or a mass of cells, we begin to lose our own humanity.  Skloot never loses sight of this single most critical issue; these are real human beings with all their flaws and very human concerns.  Beyond a story of a scientific milestone, this book is being a family, and about being human.nce they become to us nothing more than a disease or a mass of cells, we begin to lose our own humanity.

0439023483|5.0|This is definitely the best book I have ever read, wait now the best series.  Suzanne Collins  did so fabulously well that her books actually increased in writing strength and quality.    Usually it's hard to get a series of books that just get better from the first book.  I was  so insanely obsessed with this book that when I was reading the second one in the series  I was invited to go see a movie downtown and I actually brought to the movie theatre with me.  I read the whole movie.  I kind of feel bad for my date, but he knew I was a reading nerd, so  I hope he wasn't surprised.  I have recommended this book to pretty much everyone I know.  And  I admit even some people who probably wouldn't be able to handle the book or enjoy, it, but I definitely   did.  This is my all time favorite book. Warning it is disturbing and some points, and I bet there are  many wrinkles on the page were Rue's lullaby took place.  I loved this book, while Suzanne Collins  wrote with fire Katniss killed, and Peeta loved.  This book left me wanting more.

B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Plot/Storyline:<br />  The premise of the book was interesting.  There were plenty of red herrings, but the story just never really clicked for me. It just was not a perfect story for the \\"Castle\\" franchise. The plot and storyline never rang true for me. One of my favorite lines from the show is the description of Castle/Rook as, \\"A nine year old with a sugar rush.\\" That feeling is missing for me from this novel.<br />Characters:<br />  The characters never changed or grew in any way during Naked Heat. There was no character development really. They seemed to be cookie cutter characters who did the basics of what Rook and Heat are known for, rather than doing anything to stretch those boundaries at all.<br />Writing Style:<br />  I found the dialogue to be lacking the spark and wit of both the TV show and the first book Heat Wave. Whichever writer undertook this novel just did not have the same oomph to their writing as I had come to expect from the show and first book. The timing was off, and there was a missed opportunity for better writing.<br /><br /> Note: Castle is a TV series, and no one knows who writes the books, but it was obvious to me that the writing style of Naked Heat was vastly different from that of the previous novel: Heat Wave.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|I was introduced to the music of Tommy Emmanuel while lying in a hospital bed and feeling depressed as I flipped through various channels on the television.  The flipping came to a halt when I heard for the first time the music of Tommy Emmanuel.  He was playing, as I later found out, Mombasa.  I had caught the televised taped concert performance of \\"Center Stage\\" in progress.  The gusto Emmanuel puts into his performance was invigorating.  I was hooked; I had to have this music for my own.<br /><br />I want to share the fantastic music Tommy creates so I have shown this DVD to everyone who comes to visit me.  Tommy Emmanuel captures what it really means to play the acoustic guitar with expression to the fullest.  It is astonishing that he is able to play such a different amount of musical sounds with a guitar.  Usually on a concert DVD or CD there are one or two pieces I do not care for, the exception is \\"Center Stage,\\" every piece was incredible.<br /><br />The quality of the sound and the picture are excellent on the DVD.  This is one DVD that I find myself returning to watch and never tire of it.  I bought both the DVD and CD.  While it is much more entertaining to watch and listen to the DVD, the CD allows me to take this extraordinary music to listen to while in my car.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.

I can't believe what a pathetic rip off of Anne Rice this is.  The whole larger chromosome for the DNA of withches...hello, have you read the Mayfair witch books by Anne Rice?  Same thing!  how shameful a rip-off!  The only saving grace is the alchemy talk which is new to me but even Diana ruins that with endless babble. I feel sad about this book, I was looking forward to a 'smart' Harry Potter but its really a Harry Potter book for the soccer moms of the kids who are reading Harry Potter.

B001P9EQH8|2.0|The headphone amp definately boosted the loudness of the music but it utterly demolished the sound quality.  The highs were muted and became muddy, the lows were distorted, and it just sounded horrible.  I tried it with several headphones, in-ear, on-ear, and over ear and each time it sounded really bad.  I recommend you don't waste your time and if you want a headphone amp, spend some money so that you get one that won't distort and make your music sound horrible.  That way you won't be like me, stuck with a crappy headphone amp that is too cheap and isn't worth my time to even send back with shipping and all the hassel.

0439813786|5.0|This book is a graphic novel and I was not aware of that when I purchased. However, it has turned out to be a most amazing book. It has parts that are displayed in picture and parts that are wrote out as sort of a commentary. It is really a beautiful book at a great value! I would suggest this book to anyone!
B004JAUCQE|4.0|Getting a feel for Several Shades of Why May may reward the cursory listener with a feel similar to one that could be had by stringing together all of those quieter, campfire friendly numbers on Dinosaur Jr's slew of 90s releases - that trademark bracket of stoned surrender within which all of the songs here sit comfortably. The unsyncopated, over-the-top riffs characterizing virtually all of J's other work show up here in a much more subdued form if they show up at all. This time around J explores much softer and ultimately more melodic ground, and he has the company of about half a dozen others helping make it all happen.  The pleasantly repetitious \\"Listen to Me\\" appeals as the perfect opening statement for a body of work rich in emotional highs and lows.  \\"Not Enough\\" tromps along cheerfully augmented with Ben Bridwell, Kevin Drew, and Kurt Vile joining J Mascis in vocal duties creating a heartfelt quartet. Another highmark is hazily reached in \\"Make It Right\\", where Suzanne Thorpe's flute provides one of the most uplifting hooks of all. Indeed, the album seems to be J's most convincing stab at acoustic credibility so far and not since his previous solo release over ten years ago, the live [[ASIN:B000005JCN Martin + Me]], has it been executed with the same amount of convinction. If at any point you begin thinking that this just might be J's most intimate and melodically pleasing record yet, then the catchy melancholic closer \\"What Happened\\" should provide more than enough justification for starting the whole thing back over for the first of many times.
B004G6009U|5.0|I don't see movie trailers on TV, since I time shift everything and fast forward through commercials.  So I knew nothing at all about this other than it was a Disney movie.  Nothing online, hadn't heard anyone talk about it, I mean it was an absolute null to me. But I generally really like Disney and Pixar movies, so when I came across it, I had to see it with my 7 year old.<br /><br />To say I was blown away would be putting it mildly.  I didn't know Mandy Moore did the voice, but as soon as the first song started, I recognized it straight off.  Same with Zachary Levi.  Now Mandy I could see, since I've loved her voice ever since I saw A Walk to Remember.  Zachary was a surprise, having known him only from the series Chuck, I never thought of him as a voice actor.<br /><br />And after seeing the movie a few times, I can't picture any other choices doing as good of a job.  They both do an outstanding job of emoting.  Both in the songs and in the dialog, the inflections are just absolutely perfect.  Her squeak when she first hits him.  His \\"Surrounded by enormous piles of money\\" in the \\"I've Got a Dream\\" song...  The way her voice shifted so well in her bipolar scene...  It was the little touches like that which put this movie right to the top for me.<br /><br />Songs?  I had to buy the soundtrack and it's all my son wants to listen to now, whether on the TV (I use a media center PC for my TV so it's all available), on the computer, or on the ipod in the car.  We're singing tangled songs all over the place.  I found these songs to be my all time favorites now from any of the animated musicals.  I never thought they'd get anyone to shine better in their musical animations than Jodi Benson (hope I spelled that right) from the Little Mermaid, but Mandy Moore nailed it.  Songs are incredibly rich and have a lot of depth musically, and as always, are hilarious and very, very enjoyable.  Even the score for the rest of the movie was great, and I crank the music from the dancing scene when I'm driving around too, great stuff.<br /><br />The animation was wonderful, and the job they did with her hair, as well as the horse's expressions (as someone else mentioned in a review, the horse is a riot), and Pascal, the Chameleon...  Was everything that Disney is known for when they're doing their jobs well.<br /><br />Another review also mentioned the poor marketing job and such, which I guess I can attest to at a different level, as I had not noticed anything at ALL about it until March 2011 here, a few weeks ago.  But despite that, this has shot right to my number one animated movie...  And I never thought I'd see ANYTHING supplant that spot for my 7 year old, above Cars and Wall-E...  But this one did for both of us.<br /><br />Great movie for all ages, and hopefully a sign that Disney is solidly back on track.iving around too, great stuff.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I can only say EXCELLENT. Excellent costumes, excellent casting, excellent acting, excellent scenery, excellent recreation of a true love story. This is a beautiful love story you will want to watch over and over.
B00003CX8N|5.0|The service from Amazon was great; the movie arrived within a few days in perfect condition.  I actually just watched it last night (do you have a tap on my tv?) because I ordered it shortly after I viewed it on tv and decided I wanted my own copy but having just seen it thought I would wait a bit to enjoy it again.  As per the movie, I love the story; it starts the year I was born and the scenery is so nostalgic to that era.  It is a narrative movie and I like that style, as though you're viewing someone's life while they are thinking about it.  It would be too slow for anyone wanting exciting action in their viewing; it has the reality of day to day existence as it was for people just after World War II.  The theme is basically the correspondence between a woman writer in New York City and the head of a bookstore in London and their relationship developing through her search for various books not available in New York at an affordable price for her.  I can feel the years passing in their exchanges and sharing of their experiences with their friends and coworkers.  Her desire to go to England to visit is great, but always overcome by circumstance and cost.  I am quite an anglophile and thoroughly enjoyed the visual and verbal references to England.  The flow is smooth and the relationship development subtle in the movie.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are wonderful in their parts and Judy Dench has an interesting supporting role as Hopkins wife. If you like plays, literary references, historical period pieces and enjoy detail and ambiance, you will like this movie. If you like Masterpiece Theatre you will like it.  If you like biographies you will probably like it.  I could watch it just for the historical detail.  I definitely recommend it.
B00008G8LG|5.0|As much as i loved deborah kerr and yul brenner in Anna and the King of Siam, thiis rendition is a whole different and excellent drama. Jodie Foster is fantastic, and the King is elegant, regal, and sexy. The attraction between them is tangible, and their individual reactions well done. The story goes further than the Broadway play or the movie, what happens is both terrifying and heartbreaking. it is more than worth the money and can be watched again and again.

0312600844|2.0|A lot has obviously been written about \\"Freedom,\\" so I don't know what I can add except to say that I found it to be merely a collection of stories that didn't need to be there. By that I mean that you could pull any one-hundred page section out of the book---perhaps print it incorrectly and leave out the story of Eliza, or Jenna, or even Richard---and it wouldn't make a bit of difference. The theme may be sprinkled throughout the book, but it doesn't build in any necessary way. Franzen seems to want to be Tolstoy---he mentioned \\"War and Peace\\" multiple times---and thus he imitates the grand sprawl of Tolstoy. But there's a reason why when people discuss \\"War and Peace\\" or \\"Anna Karenina\\" they sometimes want to ignore the last one-hundred pages of each. Tolstoy's sprawl is beautiful, yet it doesn't get where he wants it to be, so he has to tack on an unsatisfying ending that explains to the reader the Big Idea. Franzen does the same with \\"Freedom,\\" and it's not a strength.    I also found the writing painfully clunky at times. Again, much of it simply didn't need to be there. It felt at times like some of his practice writings seemed impressive to him so he jammed them in, whether they fit or not. Sorry, but descriptions like \\"The kitchen area was a nauseating, never-cleaned sty that smelled like a mental illness\\" don't work for me. It's a weak and unnecessary metaphor that adds little.    The New York Times Book Review called it \\"a masterpiece of American fiction\\" and claimed, \\"Like all great novels, 'Freedom' does not just tell an engrossing story. It illuminates, through the steady radiance of its author's profound moral intelligence, the world we thought we knew.\\" My problem is that I didn't find it profound or moral. It felt as light as the typical summer beach book. I'm left not with outrage or awe or attentiveness to anything new in my world but instead with a bored \\"So what?\\" That's the one response a masterpiece should never elicit.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|\\"Hereafter\\" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this \\"gift\\" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called \\"Hereafter\\". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.<br /><br />This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).<br /><br />Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about \\"head-tapping\\" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the \\"white light\\" experience many have when near death.<br /><br />\\"The Eastwood Factor\\" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for \\"Invictus\\" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating.

0465011047|4.0|This was a book club selection I never would have picked up on my own but am so glad I read it.  What a horrifying account of atrocities that are happening in MY lifetime and continue to happen today.  A glimpse into the life behind the curtain of North Korea that left me disturbed and morally outraged.  This fascinating memoir by Kang Chol-Hwan tells the story of a nine year old boy who is sent to a labor camp for ten years with his family for political crimes against the state committed by his grandfather.  In the telling of his personal story - which rivals on many levels the picture we have as Westerner's of the concentration camps of WWII Germany - he also shows the true life struggle of the everyday world under the dictatorship of North Koreans and the propaganda of their form of Communism.  I was appalled that I was not aware of the real story of North Korea and urge everyone and anyone to read this book.  Because the details of the camp are stark and horrific, it isn't a book for young children but it is not graphic in the telling; merely sad and compelling.  I love history lessons in the form of a story I can sink into like a good novel and this is one of those rare kind of gems.
B003INBNXO|4.0|A friend of mine highly recommended this movie.  I'm not sure if it is the best kung fu movie ever made(which was his claim),  but it makes my top 10.  Yip Man was a great person as well as a great martial artist which this movie shows.   I bought it without ever seeing it.  Worth every penny.
B001Q9E9F6|4.0|The Long Tail by Chris Anderson begins with an introduction of an article that discusses the use of online retailers and how consumers are given more options when making purchases. Some online retailers, such as Amazon.com, use their \\"recommendations\\" feature to suggest other items to consumers while they are browsing online or even through email. Through online retailers, people are given more options for products that they normally wouldn't go into a store with the intention of purchasing such recommendations like the ones that Amazon.com makes. This can be beneficial for the consumer, but it definitely beneficial to the merchant who is able to add more to a sale.    Chris Anderson discusses how a large population of customers with a high freedom of choice will create a certain degree of inequality by favoring the upper 20% of items (hits or head) against the other 80% (non-hits or long tail). In the book, Anderson explains how this theory shows how consumers today are no longer concerned with large numbers of a small selection of popular items, but instead would rather see and purchase from a small volumes of a variety of the hard to find unique items. This also provides a greater profit increase for merchants as well since the selling of items that have smaller volumes makes them guaranteed to sell because they are more likely to be unique and a larger variety.   Though this book is from 2006, I believe that the internet and social media have only continued to change and improve business models today. Many companies are using the internet even more as well as using more social media outlets such as Facebook to help sell more products or even attract more consumers to their stores.    I thought the book was a good read, with a concept that was understandable but also may be confusing to readers. Before the average consumer may have believed that they only purchase what they need and what's popular. Today, our economy and world has changed so much that I believe that consumers would rather see small numbers that has variety instead of seeing a large numbers of a small selection of \\"popular items\\". Consumers today want to be able to have more choices instead of only following along and purchasing from the \\"plenty of the few\\" group. Overall, I think this book is a good read for all, but specifically managers for companies who are still get adjusted to using social media and the internet and will help provide beneficial insight to their strategic development.
0670022411|5.0|Dr. Diana Bishop has been researching alchemical manuscripts and has stumbled upon a manuscript called Ashmole 782. Once she touches it she feels that her life isn't going to be the same. Her carefully crafted world that she has built without the help of magic is about to come crashing down on her and she will have to give in to her destiny. Having turned her back on her heritage she is about to be thrown head first into menacing vampires and threatening witches. The one bright side to this destiny is that it includes an intelligent and sexy 1500 year old vampire named Matthew Clairmont.<br /><br />Matthew has been waiting for the day that the Ashmole manuscript would finally come to light. Of course, he isn't the only one. Other witches, daemons and vampires have been anxiously waiting too. Each species thinks the book holds different information. The witches believe it contains the source of all witch power past and present. The vampires believe the book explains the vampire longevity and strength and the daemons think it holds their story, beginning, middle and end.<br /><br />Matt's original plan was to watch and wait with everyone else but for some reason his protective nature comes out when he is around Diana. Matt is a professor of biochemistry and he has been working on why the vampires seem to be dying out. He thinks Ashmole 782 will be able to tell him. What he didn't count on is falling in love with Diana. This leads to HUGE problems because it is against the covenant of the Congregation (made up of 3 members of each species) and the punishment is death. What no one else counted on either was Diana is also a VERY powerful witch. Her father was a Proctor and her mother was a Bishop from the original Salem witches.<br /><br />Love, love, LOVED this book! Diana and Matt's relationship gradually grows throughout the book. Diana deals with a lot of issues including learning her new powers and finally coming to grips with her parents death when she was seven. I fell in love with these two and the sexual tension is excruciating! They were just perfect.  Deborah's story weaves thousand of years worth of history into an action packed masterpiece. She has built this fantastic world that had me turning the pages and clinging to every word. The writing had me crying with Diana, cheering Matt and Diana's relationship, laughing at the banter, and shaking with anger at the Covenant. Just magical and I didn't want the story to end! Since the ending seems to be left wide open I am hoping that this story does continue. Highly recommend this one!two and the sexual tension is excruciating! They were just perfect.

It's a real 5-star.<br /><br />But I want to note that this book is still very much in print, its just been delayed.

B001B6EAOY|5.0|I LOVE THIS CARD! I bought 2 of them, 1 for my brother and 1 for me, from a Chinese website for $4 total.   Aside from the fact that it took WAY to LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG to get here. I'm SOOOOO Happy i got them! They both work great! Now I can play all the PSP backups i want! :) Currently we have one 4 Gig card each and going to get an 8 gig class 4 sandisk card from ebay, then we'll both have 8 gigs! One of us will get both 4 gig cards and the other gets the 8 gig. :) Thats why I love having 2 slots for the cards, it's MUCH better Than 1! if it only had 1 slot then we would both have to buy 8 gig cards instead of using the 4 gigs together for one! and when i get a 2nd 8 gig we'll each have one 8 gig and one 4 gig, making TWELVE (12) GIGS EACH! :)    But i'm stunned that it can also use cards from different formats at the same time! I put my 4 gig SDHC and my phones 2 gig Non-SDHC and it made 6 gigs! they are different formats! How does it do that!?    Anyway! BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A PSP! SOOOO much CHEAPER & COOLER than regular Memory Sticks! Think about it!  you can buy one 8 gig SanDisk MicroSD from StraightTrading for $12 and buy this for about $7, so for $19 you can have a 8 gig Memory stick (thats upgradeable and separates to work with MicroSD devices),   or you can buy a normal 8 gig memory stick for $30 (not upgradeable and can't separate to work with MicroSD devices)   and for $12 more you buy another 8 gig and you got a 16 gig Memory stick for a total of $30! And if you pay $25 to get a 16 gig MicroSD you then got a 24 gig Memory stick and a leftover 8 gig microSD! and so on!    BUY THIS! Or get it where i got it and wait a month to get it! [...]    (The item listed in the link says 16 GB Max but thats PER CARD, this one is the same way.    Hope you enjoyed my review! :)

I know it's not as flashy as some of the movies that have come out recently, but this movie was ahead of it's time when it was released.  Story was excellent, Acting was excellent, and the Special Effects still hold up today.  So glad I bought this movie - They're here!!!!
B001ECDVKE|1.0|I suppose it happens to most directors; they get too big for their britches, the moron studio heads agree to let them make their pet project about whatever obsessive nostalgic interest they have in times past (and times that should have been left for dead), and absolute dreck is born.  I get campy movies and humor, I like bizarre/dry/oddball humor.  There isn't any of that to be found here, so I'm really not sure what's there to commend the movie.  My answer:  nothing.
0316098337|4.0|Room was an excellent book. Not only was it suspenseful, it was an amazing sociological study of a mother and child who had no contact with the outside world for several years, and the kinds of situations they faced once they were out in the world as we know it.  It was also interesting writing, written from the 5 year-old's first person perspective. My only complaint was that the last third of the first half of the book got a little monotonous. But then when the second half of the book started, I couldn't put it down. It certainly did make me aware, also of what a girl who is kidnapped and held as a prisoner, such as in the famous case of Elizabeth Smart, must go through.
0061122416|4.0|This is a great read if you go into it understanding that it is a metaphor. I picked this book up at the suggestion of a friend who loved it. I found the first half to be very slow (and why it only has 4 stars instead of 5). Had it not been for my friend suggesting I may have stopped reading, but about halfway through it just got so good. I started writing down quotes and telling friends about it.    It's a quick read and a great literally take on the meaning of life.

B000J103WK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000J103WK Eagles: Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne [HD DVD]]]    If you still have an HD DVD player you need to purchase this disc.  If you weren't an Eagles fan before, you will be now.  The video transfer is crystal clear; as good if not better than any concert you've watched on Palladium or HDNetMovies.  The sound is stupendous in DTS 5.1.  What a great mixing job was done for this disc.    Yeah, this is The Eagles 30 years later, but I think you'll be happy to hear how the music and musicians have stood the test of time, plus their tunes from the last decade as well.  Very nice that they incorporated many of their classic solo tunes too.
0756404738|3.0|It's not great.  It's not terrible.  It's just ok.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the first book was so spectacular that you just can't help yourself from being disappointed.  The story is all over the place and so drawn out it's painful. In some places I found myself skimming ahead to find out when this particular storyline would end.  Moerover, there seem to be no plot or direction to the story - things just happen to Kvothe without anything getting resolved.<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend the first book to my friends but hold off on recommending this one until the next one comes out.  If the third book is good, read this one.  If the third book is bad, stop after the first one.

The index is minimal.  The book may work if you use it as a tutorial and got through it starting in chapter 1.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Excellent album as a whole. Very much like a rock opera, and deeply influenced by Queen. It is pumped up, melodic and flows on no-stop, with swells of loud dynamics and passion. The classical background is very evident, it's what gives the musicality to the album.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|We've got Clueless (1995), loosely based on Jane Austen's Emma, then there is 10 Things I Hate About You (1998), which was loosely based on Taming of The Shrew.  Now we have Easy A, loosely based on Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.  This is the latest installment in a line of teenage comedy movies which are loosely based in classic literature, to give them a little more brainpower than the usual unrealistic groupspeak lovescript which runs rampant throughout romcoms.      Easy A is a good movie, as far as a high school comedy goes.  Emma Stone plays a very likeable and relatable genius high school student outcast named Olive, who just happens to have the coolest ex-hippie type parents ever (this is where she starts being a little less relatable).  In this incarnation of the smart girl who doesn't get any, rather than being a prodigious artist (ie. Rachael Leigh Cook in She's All That) she's more like Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, a garden-variety overachiever.  In this twist on the story, she makes the egregious error of talking to her best friend in the school bathroom, telling a lie about having a one night stand, without checking to see if the stalls were empty first (reminiscent of the folly of the three office secretaries in 9 to 5).  This mistake causes Olive to start living a double life, as a slutty girl the guys actually notice, who in reality, has never even been on a date, much less slept with anyone.  The double life continues to get more complicated as the story progresses, making an ironic twist back to her being an outcast as people become disgusted with her behavior (or perceived behavior as the case may be).      Peppered with quick wit and smart tongue-in-cheek remarks from Olive's first-person account of her story, as well as inclusion of some classic '80s teen comedy clips (and some soundtrack music bytes you might recognize if you are any age over 25) the movie is well-written and intelligently funny.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I listen to this album at least 2 times a day. It's a must buy for anyone who likes indie/folk/bluegrass. If you don't own it it has to be in your collection. I have turn at least 5 people on to Mumford & Sons from this CD alone. Pick it up you won't be disappointed.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I picked up this film after watching How to Be starring Rob Pattinson. My niece had seen it and gave Rob a good review. Needless to say I was already a fan of Rob and curious how he would play this part.    This movie tells the story of Dali and Garcia-Loca with sensitivity and passion. In a time where loving one another was not acceptable and where revolutionaries were routinely slaughtered these two artists found something that would haunt and inspire them forever.     There were some parts of the movie that were not really explained well that I would have liked to see some back-story on but overall I really enjoyed it. I thought the acting was superb and that the story flowed well. I found myself wishing that we lived in a world where people didn't need to hide who they really were and were free to fully express themselves. I know that this story was from a time long ago but the reality is, I don't think we have grown to much since then in regards to sexual freedom.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Ten years after the original \\"Phantom of the Opers\\" ended mysteriouly unresolved-the Phantom turns up as the mystery man who runs a second rate vaudeville troupe in a tacky sideshow on Coney Island.  Coney Island?  Maybe the Phantom has a taste for Nathan's Franks and Orange Julius\\". Meanwhile back in France, Christine has married Raoul and they have a ten year old son. Raoul is now a bum and has squandered away his fortune gambling, and Christine in order to support the family takes singing engagements and has now accepted a booking in Coney Island. There is also a mystery that is resolved early about the identity of the real father of Christines son. Hmmmmm...makes you wonder that Christine and the Phantom did engage in some hanky-panky in the sewers under the Paris Opera House.  Well at least they didn't have to go on \\"The Maury Show\\" and take a DNA test. I am being a smart-ass about the DNA test but this \\"sequel\\" it utterly ridiculous.  The movie version of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" concluded the story on a beautiful note filmed in black and white with one red rose left at Christines tomb.    Despite my harsh reservations about the tacky continuation of the Phantom saga, \\"Love Never Dies\\" contains some of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's lovliest music including the title song which is absolutely beautiful. Other songs to listen to include \\"Coney Island Waltz\\" \\"Til I Hear Her Sing\\", \\"Only For Him/Only For You\\", \\"Beneath A Moonless  Sky\\".    At least the CD offers much pleasure listening to the songs but continuing the story in Coney Island changes the tone from elegantly dark and mysterious to garish and tacky.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This is an old movie but my 3 and 4 1/2 year olds loved it.  My 4 1/2 year old even cried at the end.
0061122416|4.0|the book was described in a ''good'' condition and so it was when i got it in the mail :)
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable gives me great quality HD video and audio from my Apple TV.  It does exactly what it should.  There is NO reason to spend any more that this for an HDMI cable.  More expensive cables do the EXACT same thing as these cables, these just do it for less.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Great movie!  Went with my boss/girl friend when it came out at the theatres and since then she has passed away and still love the movie.  Romantic, funny and even serious parts.
0140143505|5.0|This is a must for all book lovers.  A small but memorable book of letters (also a wonderful movie).
031261246X|5.0|I am a veracious reader of several genres: hard sci-fi, and techno-thrillers. I am proud to own original prints of almost every Ludlum and Clancy novel. Even though I read this on my Kindle I'm getting a first edition with the hopes that I can get it signed by Mark.<br /><br />I LOVED THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Here's the feedback I gave directly to Mark:<br /><br />==================================<br />Finished it last night. I give you 5 stars.  Probably a bit generous, but not by much. This is the kind of book that really appeals to me; one of two genres that I just can't get enough of (the other being hard sci-fi).<br /><br />Constructive criticism:<br /><br />* It's not long enough. I think you could have done more character development, spent more time covering early disasters caused by the viri, and spent more time with diversions into the intrigue of the technology. For example a deeper expose into how rootkits actually worked, described in laymans terms (e.g. by Jeff to Sue who was really clueless) would have been cool.  I wanted it to be as thick as Hunt for Red October.<br />* I found a few editing errors. I'm sorry to say I didn't note them (I was enjoying the read too much to be distracted!).  Not really YOUR fault, but there were more than a few and that's not good. (Now I feel like the guy who says \\"your code is buggy\\" but doesn't provide repro steps...sorry).<br />* You did a nice job of keeping it \\"dirty\\".  That is, life, code, people, etc... are not perfect. They all have flaws. You did a nice job of reflecting this throughout (e.g. lots of the strains of the virus were failures). But I think you could have taken this even further. Particularly when I think about your \\"mission\\" for writing this book:  Make people aware of the reality of the situation.<br />* I found the timelines confusing and sometimes I thought \\"that's not realistic\\".  Characters flying from the US to Moscow to Italy seemed to happen in about 4 hours ;-).  Where's the jetlag? Where's the 3+ hours needed to actually catch an airplane these days? I always cringe when I encounter this in novels; but I'm also a frequent traveller so live the reality.<br /><br />Absolute positives:<br />* Utterly believable. You absolutely accomplished your goal of scaring the crud out of me.<br />* The plot/story line built very well. I was sucked in and by about 2/3 through I WOULD NOT put it down because I had to know what happened next.<br />* Great detail and texture. E.g. The picture of the Chechnyan cabbie & his taxi in my mind's eye was crystal clear.<br /><br />Kudos to you.<br />==================================<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that will suck you in and take you away then open your eyes to a real world problem you can't go wrong with Zero Day.hese days?

0316098337|4.0|This story was recommended to me by a coworker.  She had purchased the Kindle version and said that I should try reading it.  I found the book in a local store and bought it.  Initially, it was a bit uninteresting to me and hard to follow because of the language. I had to read certain parts over again to decipher who was talking this is why I gave it 4 stars. However, once I began to understand the mind of Jack it was a pleasureable read. I would like to see a follow up on how Jack and Ma continue to cope on Outside and what happens to Old Nick.
143350393X|5.0|This is a great study bible. The online resourses are great. The online resourses are worth the cost os the bible.
0061537969|4.0|Interesting slant giving the dog much more than average smarts.  Not being interested in car racing I was a little bored in spots.
B002ZG99N6|1.0|Boring Sentimental Tripe:  That says it all.  In between the god-awful story about a murderous robber with a heart of gold, and his love affair with a bank manager whom he has terrorized during a robbery - yup, that's what I said!  Maybe the Town is Stockholm! - there are some okay action sequences which are nevertheless totally unrealistic:  the bad guys never seem to make a mistake.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|A lot of what I listen to in the car is music from my favorite movies. The Last Samurai is one of my 5 favorite movies of all time and one of the reasons for it, is Hans Zimmer's movie soundtrack. It is music that you never forget, especially if you have seen the movie.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie is really good and everyone in my family liked it. It's very sad but really gives you an idea of what life was like for the Jews in concentration camps. I would also recommend the book.  This is one of my favorite movies.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|This case isn't giving me the triple-threat solution that I got in the past, from my favorite Claro! iSkin case, which provided shock, scratch and screen protection in one tight package; but, it does the job with good interface functionality and some limited shock and scratch protection in a non-slip silicone sleeve. Fits well and easily. Not high style, but does the job.
015603252X|5.0|Magnificent book, a masterpiece. The author, Amos Oz, through the lens of his family's and his own life, takes us through the history of the Jews in mid-20th Century Poland the the birth and growth of the State of Israel.  As always, Oz is incredibly intuitive, poetic and compelling.
B000002PCS|4.0|From one of the most romantic movies of all time comes some of the most romantic music of all time. And anything from the legendary composer John Barry is great. I also own his Dances With Wolves and Out of Africa soundtracks. Just sit back and close your eyes.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|these movies are pretty good. the last three are better but owning all six is imperative to any movie collection
B004N66XYE|5.0|Here's the old and new UP/Down info. After airing of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes (alas only 3) advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh who is in both the old and new) and also now including Atkins as Maud. You get the same house, same music, same title. After \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" the pair of actresses combined again in creating \\"The House of Elliott\\", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own \\"complete collection.\\"<br /><br />No disappointment from me or my wife with the 2010 3 episode addition compared to the older TV blockbuster series. The new cast keeps up the believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house (+ music) gives the old lovers the flavor of the past, even if the interior has been redecorated to 1936. It takes only the 1st episode to fall in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165. Excellent cast. With the long bonus feature, there is a hint at more. For me...like handing a fat man a box of chocolates and asking, \\"Do you want more?\\" YES!<br /><br />Interesting that they had the \\"to be King Geo VI\\" in the show, prior to the abdication of his King brother, and he did not stutter. After the success of \\"The King's Speech\\" about the same time as this series release, that bit of trivia is evident.<br /><br />As for the original \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" series. It is 27-year span epic winning 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. Since it's period drama it never goes out of style. It's a British TV saga classic.<br /><br />Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless. I strongly recommend you get the 40th Collection and see it while waiting for the new 21st century produced episodes DVD to be released.<br /><br />This newest release (40th Anniversary Collection) provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE! Compare that to the new release with only 3 episodes.<br /><br />SUBTITLES-Anniversary set OFFERS SUBTITLES,like the new episodes. Helpful for some of us. A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.<br />And YES, I bought the new 3 episodes to go with the older episodes. And hoping for more.orth owning today.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I bought three of her albums. I'm a Prime member so the delivery was outstanding as usual. The only reason that I gave a 4 star rating is because of the quality of the recordings. All three of the CDs seem to have been recorded at too high of a level...to the point of being slightly distorted. I'm pretty sure it's not me...is sounds pretty much the same whether I played them on the Infinity system in my car or my Onkyo/Bose system in my house...and particularly noticable on my mp3 player. As far as the music goes...I would rate it PG13...not for anyone who's sensitive to sexually suggestive material. If you can get by that...Katy's fun to listen to and makes you want to shake your booty!
B003YLK2RI|5.0|I thought they needed BluRay or something like that, but I think this is just perfect... Audio and image.  You can feel the energy of 80,000 souls within you...
B004AKCME8|4.0|i didn't expect much for this movie. rented on blu ray and now i own it. this movie has a predictable story but what zack snyder film isn't ? we enjoy his movie because of the visuals and how well crafted his movies are. this movie is amazing to look at. Just think 300 but with owls and less blood...
1401309666|4.0|I found Chris Anderson's book \\"The Long Tail\\" to be a both interesting and a quick and easy read. I especially liked how Anderson provided numerous graphs and charts to illustrate his examples as I found them very effective. I found this book very interesting in the fact that I would have found the concept hard to believe before reading the book. It is hard to think that selling less of more can actually be a successful strategy; however I am now a believer. After reading this book, I can completely see why this would be a worthwhile strategy to pursue.  It seems that the idea of capturing a \\"niche\\" market is the way to go in today's world where consumers have innumerable choices.   If I were to have one complaint about the book it would that the examples that Anderson chooses to illustrate his points can be somewhat repetitive. It seems that he uses solely the examples of Amazon.com and Netflix to illustrate his points throughout the book. While these examples are often both true and effective, it would have been nice to see the ideas in action in other industries. However, one example that I liked in the book was that of the music industry and the peeking of the \\"hit albums\\". I found this example especially interesting because I remember when this happened, where as I do not remember Amazon first coming out. I agree that the music industry has changed in the past ten years to where there is not really one hit song but one hit song in every specific genre of music. There is definitely worth in selling to the music industries long tail. Another example that I found interesting was that of the astronomy industry and the idea that they are moving towards a more \\"pro-am\\" idea than solely professionals. It makes sense that they would do this because there are only so many professionals that they can have looking to space at one time, however with the addition of more eyes there is a greater chance of someone seeing something important. There are not many industries where this sort of mentality would work, but astronomy seems to be one of them.   Overall, I found \\"The Long Tail\\" to be a very interesting book and a very good read. While some often examples can be repetitive, there are still a few that keep you reading and learning more about the topic. While the premise of the book can seem unrealistic at first, Anderson is very convincing and knows exactly how marketing is going to have to be done in the future.

B0000942HV|1.0|I bought this a few years ago and thought his \\"improvements\\" sucked. Stick with the original. This serves as a sterling example of the old saying \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\"
B0019IB26I|5.0|John Mayer stands alone as one of the best guitarist I have seen in my life. This CD is priceless as it shows how wonderful he is with each audience member; leaving every sweet face that adores him, feeling like they are the only one in the room. I've watched him many times; I'm considerably older than his followers but enjoy watching him interact with his audience like he's been doing this for decades longer than he is old. This is an incredible CD.
B001TODCII|5.0|I enjoyed the movies I received.  I received my movies on time and fast keep up the good work.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Muy buena pelicula, excelente calidad de imagen.    el contenido extra es un poco aburrido excepto lo de como hicieron el traje de batman y la tecnologia que utilizan lo demas no vale la pena.
1594202842|5.0|Growing up in a family that always emphasized the positive and allowed the children to find their passion on their own, and having a Chinese girlfriend, this book was a very interesting read. My parents followed Dr Spock's Baby Book which seems to go counter to the Chinese parenting style espoused in this book. Nevertheless, I think there is a lot to learn from this book and that the parenting style described has a lot of merit. This book will also motivate one to strive and work hard, if nothing else.
0525951652|5.0|This latest work, is Ken Follett at his finest.    His unbeatable character development coupled with his amazingly informative historical vignettes make this another must read.    The promise of two more works with this cast of families has me checking continuously for publication dates.    If you enjoy historical novels, do not miss this one.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy/best movie i've ever seen.  Great soundtrack from some mark guy.  Great cast, photography, editing.  Way better than citizen kane.
B003WTE886|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing album.  In today's world of manufactured and generic music, Taylor's Speak Now album stands out above the rest.  She wrote each song herself (a rarity in today's music industry), so you know that each song has personal meaning to her, and the music and production is flawless.    Amazing album, definitely lived up to expectations following her first and second albums.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|With out the character development and story line, this show would have been just like any other zombie flick.  But, the Walking Dead feels more like a nighttime soap opera blended with a zombie outbreak.  Need proof, this was one of the few zombie shows that my wife would actually watch with me.  In fact, she actually wanted to watch it.  Please keep shows like this coming.

1439102724|4.0|Once again, Jodi Picoult gives us a book that is filled with moral issues.  This time its about same-sex relationships and about infertile couples and their struggle with getting pregnant.  And once again, I could really get into the characters' heads and feelings.  I love her writing!       I live in a city where being gay is completely normal and acceptable.  Thank goodness!  So many of my friends are in same-sex relationships and I truly believe that they should have the same rights as opposite-sex couples.  Hopefully one day this will become a reality.  But enough about politics.        The only negative is that I missed the big surprise ending.  I feel that usually in books by Picoult, there's some shocking thing that happens or is revealed at the end of the book that isn't forseen.  But there wasn't really anything like that in this book.  Or if there was, I could competely see it coming so it wasn't a shock at all.       That being said, Picoult is still my favorite author and I can't wait to devour the next book that she writes!
0451197968|5.0|I was pretty surprised to see this book lurking around a second-hand store. You see, I've been familar with the film since growing up. If you'd asked me prior to seeing this document I would have bet on that movie NOT even beeing based on a book, let alone a book by the famous S. King<br /><br />My second surprise was of course that the book was good. I probably shouldn't have been so naive as to think the book would be anything like the spandex rubbish that the movie was, but whatever.<br /><br />Running man depicts a future where the underclass are controlled by television, whether being glued to the screen at home, or being part of the show. All the while pollution, corruption and elitism run rampant. Our main man, decides to take part in the Running Man, a reality show where contestants earn money per hour of avoiding death or capture by pretty much anyone in the communinty who cares to take a shot.<br /><br />the book is much more politcal than the movie, and doesn't quite have the same ending, the other major difference being: where the movie depicts a world obsessed with ridiculous 'superhero' characters, the book shows us a decrepit wasteland of America populated with scumbags and ruffians, who will do anything for a 'new dollar'<br /><br />Definately recommended, at around 200 pages reading Running Man will probably take the same amount of time taken to watch the movie...
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|How do you protect yourself when everyone is after you thinking you are someone else.  After meeting on a train Elise meets Frank.  The police and the Russian mob assume Frank is the Alexander they are looking for and the chase begins.  After all the bad reviews and the talk about this movie I was a little leery to watch it.  Before I start I should say that I've never really been a fan on Angelina Jolie or Johnny Depp.  This movie was about what I expected.  Going in you would assume that with these two the acting would be great and carry the movie.  Just the opposite was true.  The chemistry between the two of them was so bad it was almost distracting.  To be fair it was a little better then I expected, but I'm blown away that this movie was nominated for best actor, actress and picture and the Golden Globes.  The one stand out in the movie is Paul Bettany. In a week were there is not really a super stand out new release this fits right in.  I give it a C<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No, I would not
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A wonderfully done look into the Pacific, a part of WWII that is often overlooked. I think it captures the change that soldiers went through and the inhumanity that WWII brought with its truly horrific and unimaginable battles, and gives us a glimpse into the lives of the US Marine Corps. The acting is great, and they do a wonderful job of connecting the audience to the characters, though the focus is more on the war than \\"Band of Brothers\\" I think, but I feel that Hanks and Spielberg have created another war epic that will preserve the truth, history, and stories of what happened in the Pacific.
B0041T7FS6|1.0|I've just compared all the CHIC tracks which I've from other CDs and they sound much better. Isn't it possible to go into the studio with the original analog master tapes, record them with state-of-the-art A/D converters and leave it as it is - without any post-(re)mastering?    The only good part are the superb remixes by Dimitri (5 stars).
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2E3GT4HIZTJSY]]Quick video to hear for yourself the sound quality of the mic.  Recorded indoors in a barn, don't ask me why I chose this location.  Something to note:  The sound recorded by the ATR3350 was noticeably louder than the Canon's built in mic.  I tried to balance the volumes during the editing process.  Enjoy the video.

B002ZG99G8|4.0|The Losers is an action movie with very little character development, and a ridiculous ending. In other words, it's a great movie (but only if your into that type of film). Sit back, don't think about it too much, and enjoy the ride.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Ten years behind bars, and he's so antsy. You see the Rock's character - anonymously labeled \\"Driver\\" - as he restlessly paces in his prison cell, waiting out his last morning in stir, and you know something festers on his mind. Any musings as to whether he's truly been rehabilitated is put to rest when he erupts out the penitentiary and straight away visits an office and guns down a telemarketer. That's cold-blooded. That's one name off his list (yes, there is a list).<br /><br />It's good to see the Rock straying from those sappy family friendly Disney flicks. Good to see him return to his roots and bolstering his action hero street creds. FASTER works off the conventions of a B-movie revenge thriller, and good performances from Dwayne Johnson and Billy Bob Thornton elevate this thing. There are moments of pure cool cinema, like that point of view perspective from the other side of the car's speedometer which allows us a peek out at the seething face of the Rock. I don't think I've seen a revenge thriller this lean and raw and entertaining since Mel Gibson's PAYBACK more than a decade ago.<br /><br />FASTER  is told mainly from three perspectives: the Driver, the Killer, and the drug junkie Cop, with the latter two trying to catch up to the Driver as he continues to eliminate those what done him wrong, those what murdered his brother. Just about every character here is one-dimensional, but Johnson manages to lend nuance to his laconic role. Billy Bob Thornton, as he usually does, adds a little somethin' somethin' to his scruffy, 10-days-to-retirement police detective.<br /><br />One peculiar choice is the film's decision to devote so much camera time and back story to Oliver Jackson-Cohen's elegant contract hit man. He sees in Driver that one challenge he's been looking for, the one guy who may be faster than he is and that gets his competitive juices flowing. But, frankly, ultimately, I didn't think this hit man was all that interesting. He's what passes for shallow glitter. I did get a laugh though that Jackson-Cohen's biggest peeve there at the end seems to be that he's just not getting the professional courtesy he feels he deserves from the Rock. Jackson-Cohen certainly adds an element of quirk, and it doesn't hurt that his personal arc presents the stunning Maggie Grace as eye candy. Grace, Carla Gugino, and Moon Bloodgood somewhat take the edge off the testosterone level, never mind that Gugino herself plays a tough cop detective.<br /><br />Dwayne Johnson strides across the screen as a simmering, single-minded force of nature. He relentlessly drives the film, ratcheting up the pace of the story, and maybe it's a good thing after all that Jackson-Cohen's posh assassin gets his moments because this allows the viewing audience to breathe a bit. I did feel that the film backed away a bit from completely portraying Driver as the hard-bitten ex-convict out for vengeance come hell or high water. That one drawn out sequence with Driver and the pastor sort of killed the buzz. Dang that Bible-thumping. Still, FASTER satisfies your jonesing for taut, hard-core anti-hero revenge flicks. And, look at that, the Rock's suddenly got his swagger back. At least until he stars in TOOTH FAIRY 2 or something.<br /><br />The DVD's extras ain't much: an Alternate Ending (which was the original ending) and 5 Deleted Scenes with optional Director's introductions (except for the \\"Killer Takes A Picture\\" scene).low glitter.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a fan of the Anthology. They already owned multiple copies but no blu-ray. The picture quality is AMAZING. I honestly cannot believe it was filmed in the 70's. Plus the extra features are worth watching. Definitely recommend buying this.
0920668364|5.0|this is a great book from my childhood. i'm passing it along to my daughter. brand new condition. just a wonderful as i remember it to be. good book; better buy!
B000CNE092|5.0|Love this movie and had been looking for it on DVD for a while. Amazon sold this at a great price and I received it very quickly and in perfect condition. Just recently watched and and it's just as wonderful as I remembered!
0439023521|5.0|Seriously, this is the best book I have read in many years. I literally was late to work because I couldn't put it down. Katniss is an amazing character and so are Gale (though we don't learn much about him until the later books) and Peta. The situation is unbelievable, engrossing and engaging. There are twists and turns, unexpected moments and a whole range of emotions.     As I don't have children, I can't say what age this series would be appropriate for. I'll say this, though: I actually cried at a couple points while reading this (SPOILERS: at the reaping with Prim, for Rue and surprisingly when Thresh lets her go) and the Mutts at the end gave me (at age 20+) nightmares (and I don't spook easily). Perhaps the best advice for parents is to read this book BEFORE your kids so you can judge if they are ready for it or not.     This series has become the new 'thing' and I worry that because there is always an inevitable backlash against whatever becomes strongly popular and because this is a 'young adult' series. As an adult, I can say that this book is AMAZING. Start reading and try to stop! It's impossible. Everyone should read this book. EVERYONE.    Please note that this is the first in a series. The second book is Catching Fire. The last is Mocking Jay.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|I know critically and by most Trekkies this is not a favorite movie (and it broke the streak of the even number films being better than the odd numbered films).  Well, for all the nay-sayers I have to say I disagree.  Yes, there are moments where I feel some scenes are too long, or frankly not needed.  But I think that Tom Hardy's performance alone is worth watching this film.  His transformation from cloned Pickard to evil cloned Pickard is bewitching.  Also, the special effects and over all story line are captivating. Of all TNG films, I do believe this is not only the best in terms of story and character development, put clearly the best in terms of visuals. I know die-hard Trekkies will strongly disagree.
B004498KPU|4.0|I love Michael Jackson and previously owned every (I think) DVD release of his music videos. I still bought this and I love it. It's got all the great songs (including the REAL Smooth Criminal, not that MTV sped-up, edited crap) as well as some that have probably been forgotten (I LOVE Who is It the video and the song and feel it's one of the more under-rated MJ songs). It's nice to have all the videos in one place instead of having to buy each video set in order to complete the collection (for example, every DVD set before this one has Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean on it but only one has Dirty Diana).     My one and only complaint about this set is the 3-minute Ghosts. I want the whole 40-minute mini-movie not the edited down bit. Ghosts is one of the best MJ works and it's not available in any form (that I'm aware of) other than this 'music video'. PLEASE release the whole thing on DVD/Blue Ray.     If you don't own any DVDs of MJ videos, this is the (as yet) best collection. If you do own other DVDs, this is still worth getting.     RIP MJ
0670022411|5.0|This book is nothing short of amazingly spectacular!!!  The time, energy, thought, and creativity that Harkness has put into this book is visible and felt on every single page.  I can't wait to read the next chapter in this series; reading this first book helped me to tap into inner spaces unknown to me till now - wow.  This may be a work of fiction but the parallels it draws from real life, history, relationships, and our interconnectivity with one another is Real Magic indeed. Thank you Deborah for this gift.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|I received this movie promptly and discovered it was a Blockbuster rental.  At first I was concerned, however upon immediate inspection the surface of the disc was flawless.  I fired it up on the PS3, watched the whole thing and some extras with NO problems.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.  Great product, fast delivery.
B001CBBGM2|4.0|I like Stargate Atlantis for the characters, my favorites being Sheppard, McKay, Ronon, and Teyla (with appreciation and affection for Elizabeth Weir), so I watched and enjoyed the episodes and parts of season five that showcased the characters I love so much. However, I was dismayed by a decline in the story quality in the fourth season and that really only got worse in the fifth season.     There are some excellent fifth season episodes that serve as wonderful character pieces (the Shrine and Vegas), but a complaint I have about the fifth season is that much of it seems very dry and dull. They take a keen interest in their new character, Jennifer Keller, the chief medical officer in Beckett's stead and I think that in the writers' enthusiasm, they shoehorned her into episodes and scenarios where her presence was unnecessary. I'm probably a little jaded about that because it seemed that she stole many scenes that would otherwise be Teyla's and because I really couldn't get behind the incomprehensible McKay-Keller romance angle (yikes). There's also the fact that John is woefully under-utilized.     Overall, I advocate buying it because some of the episodes are my favorites overall, for the sake of completion, and to provide financial support of the franchise, but don't go into it expecting season two or three.
B00393SFU2|4.0|[This review is for the single DVD Criterion Collection]<br /><br />I really wanted one of Fritz Lang's first \\"talkies\\" and as I do enjoy Peter Lorre (and here, in one of his first appearances) I had to get \\"M.\\"<br /><br />\\"M\\" deals with several themes:  A child murderer, two groups both out to get him (one, criminal -- the other, the police) and as well the terror in the streets.<br /><br />The luring of the child to her doom is not easy to watch, although done tastefully for use of a better word.  You hear no scream.  Just a bouncing ball that stops, a balloon toy recently purchased now caught in the phone lines.  Pretty creepy.<br /><br />Peter Lorre plays the child murderer and finds himself before a kangaroo court made of thieves and murderers that want justice and his head!  As I said, several themes:  Is a man guilty of murder if he \\"can't help it\\" and the voices in his head tell him to?  The thieves have one thought:  let him go to the asylum, he gets out after being declared harmless and does it again!  Is mob justice just?<br /><br />Is the insanity defense proper?<br /><br />And finally, the torture parents go through at the loss and/or death of their child, though this is touched on only briefly.<br /><br />The only counterpoint on this tale is the slow-moving committees that are set up:  this film is quite talkative in the first third and I felt that really dragged the film.<br /><br />The film is quite thought-provoking and is a msut-see for film students and murder mystery fans!<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />My DVD was from the Criterion Collection and did not have any features.

B002KLAL4W|2.0|After their 2006 untitled('Avocado') record, which proved one of their solidest if seemingly uninspired to many, records, Pearl Jam officially crossed the line into below-par mediocrity.    I've listened to this record again and it's slowly grown on me. However, there are just far too many songs that feel like little effort was made their creation. I know Pearl Jam's thing is sort of to take a couple of chords and run with them, yet there aren't many songs that make a large impact.    Just check opener \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" Pearl Jam would have made a song like that work as late as the previous album, but the song lacks any kind of memorable melody and rhythm Leadoff single \\"The Fixer\\" is just plain horrible, generic trash that does nothing. I suppose \\"Just Breathe\\" is alright if you're into acoustic folk ballads . There are 4 songs on here that are good to some extent: \\"Amongst the Waves\\" which has a nice melody with Mike's best solo here, but sounds weak in spots. \\"Unknown Thought\\"(a song that takes a few listens to appreciate) \\"Speed of Sound\\" for creating a memorable melody, and closer \\"The End\\" which proves Eddie can still sound as beautiful as ever. For some reason, I now like \\"Got Some\\" because the energy level makes catchiness unnecessary, but \\"Johnny Guitar\\",on the other hand which takes the coolest rhythm here and runs it into the ground, is a totally different story. Have you forgotten how to end a song right, guys?    In closing, this doesn't feel like enough effort was put into songwriting. New wave's okay, but not if you can't add more melody changes over the long term, because that doesn't work.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|great book. i really loved how Haddon made this book from Christopher's point of view. This book had made me look at children with &#34;Special Needs&#34; a lot differently
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Saw this for the first time in a special screening at a local theater, with my son. We loved it! It's everything a good zombie movie should be - it's hilarious, snarky, a wee-bit scary, a wee-bit dramatic, and it has well-done zombie make-up and blood/gore... it even makes for a good date movie, because of the how-to-be-a-good-boyfriend factor!  ;-)<br /><br />We see the main character start out as a lumbering, brainless (quite zombie-like, in fact), average-guy oaf who forgets his girl's flowers, doesn't really dedicate himself to doing all the things a good boyfriend should do for his significant other. But, by the end of the movie, he's learned his lesson.<br /><br />See? A great movie all around. What more could you want?
0670022411|5.0|For anyone who enjoys reading historical novels intertwined with present day, and has a love for the supernatural, this book is for you! Deborah Harkness grips you with the first pages and doesn't let go until the end. One of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading in a while. Two thumbs up! I am loking forward to the next book in 2012.
B0026KO7D8|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone and especially I feel for people in their mid 20's who have a chance to succeed at this with the 40 years of work ahead of them.  I have read it twice and will continue to read it the rest of my life.  I gave it to my daughter and son-on-law and they both enjoyed it as well.  If you truly want to be debt free, not have money issues ever, then this is your book too.
1416575464|5.0|This guide is appropriately titled!  What an excellent resource for expressing oneself in the home!  Very comprehensive content and knowledge packed into pages & pages of beautifully clear photography with inspiring commentary.  LOVE it!
B000MG1ZG0|3.0|Has anyone bought this cd from Amazon recently? Is there still a defect in \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" or did you receive the second repressing with the defect removed? Thanks in advance for any replies.
0547260695|5.0|This is truly a beautiful edition of The Little Prince, one of my favorite books. I bought this as a christening gift because it is the type of book that will grow with the child and can be kept and treasured forever.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|OMG, this was the worst of the three books...I couldn't get through it at all and I forced myself hoping it would get interesting and that the main character would reappear in the story line more centrally.  I got about 3/4 through it and just gave up as I kept asking myself \\"why am I reading this?\\".  Don't get me wrong, I adored the first two books but then again the main character was central to the storytelling.  I wouldn't spend money on this personally.  There are so many other things out there to explore.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I purchased this book and paid more for it than any other kindle book that I have purchased so far. I was thinking, that just because the author was famous and well liked it would be a good read. In my opinioin, stressing the words my opinion, it was a bore! I felt like it was a waste of money. I read 60 pages into it and could not finish because it was so slow, hum drum and boring. I have read books by independent authors that would blow this book away. If this book picked up by the middle or end I have no idea because I could not get that far. If I have to read that much of a book, for it to become a interesting, then no thank you. What a waste of money.
B000002LQR|2.0|One thing I didn't like about this album that I tried in vain to savor is the rhythms. Another thing is how prestigious it is; I don't like the idea of these things being well-known, but in an effort to enjoy an album, I overlook that and listen to it anyway, sometimes.<br /><br />I'd say that most of this album is pretty relaxed.<br /><br />Lyrical-infused Moods:<br /><br />-Imaginary<br />-Profane<br />-Fascinated<br />-Reminiscent<br />-Inevitably Pressuring<br />-Self-centered<br /><br />I just didn't like the style of this album generally. Few songs that were creative. Most of the songs don't sound that distinguishing. This is a rotten masterpiece.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for those of us who grew up with the show and to all younger generations who love action movies.  I was pleasantly surprised how many stunts were in this single movie and the story-line was actually pretty complicated.  It was action-packed from start to finish.  I grew up watching the A-team and my family and I loved this movie.  The characters were fun to watch esp.  BA who was tough as nails, but also full of surprises and is consistently afraid of flying and the different twists in the movie story line made it feel like I watched at least two-three different movies, but they all eventually tied together.  The casting for this film was well done, and hard to live up to as I found myself thinking back to the original show alot at the beginning of the movie.  The cameo with the series original \\"Face\\" (Dirk Benedict) made me wish to see more cameos with all the original-series' stars, but unless I missed them there was only the one with Dirk (obviously George Peppard (Hannibal) has passed and was missed as his twinkling eyes in the A-team series always kept viewers on the edge of our seats).
B00299APH8|3.0|...you'd be amazed or more interested in what you're hearing and have a better judgement as to whether the content's benefits outweigh the production of the song.<br /><br />Moods:<br /><br />-Energetic<br />-Somber<br />-Businessman<br />-Aesthetic Appreciative<br />-Bittersweet/sweet<br />-Obscene<br />-Encouraging<br />-Tough<br /><br />Fast highlights of this album are the hits, \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" and \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" a song which is actually about people selling drugs. I decry the one part of \\"Slice of Your Pie\\" which revolves around fascination of an immature girl. On the other hand, \\"Without You\\" is the most bittersweet song on this album, but the lyrics act too weakening of the dominant romantic partner. \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\\" is a reasonable goodbye song but has a tinge of regretful feeling in it. Even though the slowness and slight crescendo of it gets annoying, the self-explanatory \\"Time for Change\\"  is a praiseworthy song. I overlooked the demos and such that didn't go along with the original related subject.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Very good return to roots collection.  I really enjoyed the takes on songs I had heard and never heard before.  Thanks!
0553573403|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said about this excellent and hugely compelling book. I read it before the HBO series premieres in April, and am so glad I did. It's dense, richly plotted, and has more twists than a pretzel shop. What I also appreciated so much was the book felt very adult. I love the Robert Jordan books and think they're again big massive worlds with an enormous cast of characters, but they seem a bit sanitized compared to this. \\"...Thrones\\" is very realistic in it's brutal, violent, and sexual telling. It's adult fantasy writing at it's best.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Unfortunately, Amazon explains little or nothing about the new Gettysburg Director's Cut blu-ray release. What exactly does `Director's Cut' mean here? These are the timings for the original theatrical release, the two previous digital releases, and the new blu-ray release, as listed at another site:      Gettysburg Original Theatrical Release - running time 3 hrs. 58 Minutes, plus a 20 Minute Intermission.  Gettysburg Laserdisc - running time 4 hrs., 29 min   Gettysburg DVD - running time 4 hrs., 14 minutes  Gettysburg Blu-Ray (2011 \\"director's cut\\") - running time 4 hrs., 31 minutes    Since the 17 minute difference between the DVD and the upcoming blu-ray release is almost exactly the same as the difference with the laserdisc release, I can only assume that the added 17 minutes will be the same as that found on the laserdisc. This included one crucial scene that for some absurd reason was included in neither the theatrical release nor the DVD release. In it, following the first day's conflict, Lee meets with his generals who were responsible for leading the first day's battles and gets an admission from them that they failed to take the crucial Cemetery Hill if not the entire Missionary Ridge heights when they were supposedly open for the taking. Thus we come to know from this scene that generals like Early and Ewell were actually at Gettysburg along with Longstreet and Pickett, and that that was the reason why Lee ordered Pickett to charge the ridge on the third day. Also included in the laserdisc was a scene when Union cavalry general Buford enters Gettysburg on the first day before moving thru the town and engaging Lee's advance division west of town. He is met by several townspeople, including an officious mayor of the town who demands protection. To my recollection - I gave up my laserdisc version several years ago when my player self-destructed - this about takes up most if not all of the 17 additional minutes. The rest of the DVD release seemed to match the laserdisc release fully.     Leaving aside the inaccuracies and omissions (some historians, for example, hold that Ewell probably couldn't have taken Cemetery Hill that first day whether he'd actually tried or not, since by late afternoon his advancing forces had become bogged down for a considerable time in chasing the Union forces through Gettysburg itself, and there was already at least a fresh division of Union troops on the summit facing the town; and a great deal of the 2nd day fighting, including General Sickles and the Wheatfield are completely neglected, while Meade hardly appears at all), the movie especially in its depiction of the Little Round Top battle on the 2nd day, along with the two-day argument that arose between Longstreet and Lee re the efficacy of continuing to fight the battle at Gettysburg, is highly vivid and accurate. Randy Edelman's music is also exceptional, while Jeff Daniel's depiction of Joshua Chamberlain, Stephen Lang's of Pickett and Tom Berenger's of Longstreet are especially outstanding. While casting Martin Sheen as the courtly Lee was controversial, I for one found his performance also excellent. The other great `stars' of the movie, of course, are the re-enactors, along with the battery of cannons that so vividly mark the prelude to Pickett's charge. In both DTS sound and blu-ray, the battle scenes especially should reach an ultimate level of excitement. Highly looked forward to!     (Note: just a measure of what's happened to movie digital release prices in the past 25 years or so, I purchased the laserdisc version of the movie at $179.95 retail, in Orlando, Florida, sometime in the mid 1990's!)
1594202842|4.0|I picked up this book because of the controversy, because one of my kids goes to school with one of her kids and because I work at Yale. From the point of view of whether it is a good read, you bet it is. I laughed out loud, which doesn't happen too often.  In point of fact, I read it all in one sitting last night. It was quick, spirited and funny. It was also quite soul-bearing. You can see she really wants to get to the heart of this and is analyzing it with an academic's vigor. I can appreciate her efforts and perhaps dub her the intellectual's Erma Bombeck.     However, it is really interesting to me that she doesn't have insight into a few things: 1.) the anger issue. Clearly anyone who can work herself up this much and have a house filled with as much screaming as is implied in this book has some anger issues. It isn't normal and calling it \\"Chinese mothering\\" seems to me to be an handy screen. I would shrivel up and die if exposed to that as an adult, so I can't even imagine imposing that on a child, regardless of purported good intentions. Since she herself admits that she can be caustic and have a sharp tongue, I have to assume she is aware that it is excessive. 2.) The dogs. Many 'western' (her loose definition) couples to go for a dog before babies. It is good training and I think it is a key part in helping one adjust expectations in terms of perfection, cleanliness and accomplishment. Dogs teach you about unconditional love. Dogs force you to do the menial caretaker labor that you might never have done before, and that you need to be totally accepting of once you have kids. It was curious to me that she was making this journey of realization with the dogs and yet it was too late apply any of the lessons to her kids. Or rather, perhaps it is surprising to me that she can make the journey to a 'western' attitude toward parenting the dogs and yet maintain the  dichotomy that the dogs are just dogs and the kids are still supposed to be automatons of successas defining the tapes in her head. Kind of sad, really.    Lastly, the little aside about her getting tenure at Yale. Christ almighty. She makes it sound as though all you have to do is write a couple of articles to get tenure at the most prestigious law school in the country. This false modesty is downright silly in the face of the fundamental facts. This is perhaps one of the most prestigious places one could be a faculty member. The studied casualness with which she treats this part of the story rings really false, especially when clearly she struggles with ego in a big way. An ego, perhaps overdeveloped by the \\"Chinese\\" parenting she received. This is an ego that compels her to extravagance when it comes to touting her kids, to pouring her excessive expectations into them and then writing a book about it. It is really curious to me that you would publish this while your kids are still in secondary school. That says \\"ego\\" to me, not the self-sacrifice she proclaims throughout the book. She would only have to wait a few more years and give them the privacy and respect they deserve as individuals. It is a bit like \\"Mommy, Dearest\\" in reverse. Who has to live this down? Does she? Not so much, when you have tenure, but the kids? You bet... She put herself first in actually seeing this book through to publication while they are still so young. I would posit that most \\"western\\" parents would balk at that exchange.
B003Y5H55Q|4.0|I was a bit hesitant about seeing Paul from the critical reviews and from the trailer, but found myself enjoying it quite a bit when I took a chance and saw it. There's a lot to see in Paul, and much like Galaxy Quest (1999), Paul both mocks its subject matter while at the same time treating it with both understanding and great affection.  A lot of talent went into Paul and it shows.  Directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland, TV's Arrested Development) and written by Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, TV's Spaced) and Nick Frost, Paul hits all the right comic notes, skewering its target audience knowingly and lovingly.<br /><br />What makes Paul work is that, at its heart, it's the ultimate scifi road trip. Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost), two major scifi/comics/UFOs fanboys from the UK, are visiting the US on a pilgrimage of sorts, hitting the biggest scifi/comics/gaming convention on the West Coast and making the grand tour of all the famous UFO-lore sites (Area 51, Roswell, 'The Black Mailbox', etc) in a huge honkin' RV.  While on the road out in the desert, they witness a car spin out of control and crash. When they hurry to see if they can help, they come face to face with the classic little green alien with huge head and enormous oval eyes. Except that he's smoking a cigarette, introduces himself as 'Paul', and talks like Seth Rogen (mainly because he's voiced by Seth Rogen, absolutely the perfect choice for this role). Paul tells Graeme (Clive's fainted) of his need to escape the government people coming after him and the road trip is on.<br /><br />The cast is great.  Pegg and Frost are perfect in their roles as fanboys who've been buddies since childhood and have never really grown up, Frost's Clive hoping to finish his breakthrough novel and Pegg's Graeme doing the illustrations for it (the triple-breasted alien woman on the cover is a running gag that keeps getting funnier). Rogen gives Paul his personality, quite literally, making him a fairly unique creation: the stoner/slacker alien who's gone native in a lot of ways but has decided it's time to phone home (largely because the powers that be have apparently decided to quit merely picking his brain and remove it instead). Jason Bateman is great as the deadpan Agent Zoil, the 'man in black' hot on Paul's trail.  Bill Hader and Joe LoTruglio are excellent comic foils as his low-grade backups, Agents Haggard and O'Reilly. Jeffrey Tambor is a scene-stealer in his role as the arrogant fanboys' icon, Adam Shadowchild. Kristen Wiig adds a lot to the comic mix as Ruth Buggs, a repressed Christian fundamentalist (she wears a t-shirt with Jesus shooting Darwin through the head) whose close-encounter with Paul ends up liberating her in a completely over-the-top way (think Jessica from True Blood, just with aliens instead of vampires). And there's a major cameo that's held in reserve until the climactic scene, but once it's revealed, your reaction will be \\"Of course! Who else?\\"<br /><br />Another fun part of Paul is picking up all of the movie references, and Paul contains a _lot_ of them, sometimes in lines that are either quotes or parodies of quotes, sometimes in scenes or visuals, from just about every major scifi movie imagineable.  Star Wars, Star Trek, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Aliens, Back To The Future, E.T., Predator,  Starman.  You name it, it's probably in there somewhere.  My personal favorite is a scene with a country & western band in a biker bar, playing their version of about the last thing you'd ever expect to hear in that context. I really want to get the DVD when it comes out so I can go back and catch all the ones I missed the first time.<br /><br />There are a few places where things do drag a bit, usually where the toilet/grossout humor (it's Seth Rogen after all) goes on a little too long. But for the most part Paul keeps things going fast and furious, and the cast are so into their roles that even when you can sense the joke coming, it's still funny when it hits you.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who loves sci-fi/alien films and for anyone who's ever been a fanboy of anything.ke coming, it's still funny when it hits you.    Highly recommended for anyone who loves sci-fi/alien films and for anyone who's ever been a fanboy of anything.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|I loved the movie from start to finish. Galifianakis was amazing, and I loved the interplay between him and the other characters. I wasn't especially attached to the main character or his suicidal story, but once he had a supporting cast of loveable characters to back the film up it got very interesting. I have recommended this movie to many a friend and will continue to do so. ENJOY!

1599218011|4.0|Love how this book is written, gives a lot of great information. Really does give the reader a lot to think about when considering healthy diets. I'll never fully give up meat and dairy tho...despite her compelling argument for doing so. All things in moderation is what I settled on. Glad I bought the book tho and I will continue to refer back to it and keep adjusting my diet until I'm comfortable with the balance I strike.
0670022411|5.0|This book is wonderfully written.  To put it bluntly, this is also the only book I ever shed a tear while reading it.  There is so much emotion that transpires during the reading.  you get lost in the words.  So much detail to history.  This would be my top pick of all books ever.  Can't wait for the next next year.
B001GV09FS|5.0|I love the music that went with the movie and this soundtrack is wonderful. I play it whenever I go anywhere in my truck and I also have it going when I'm upstairs on my computer or sewing.  I recommend it to anyone who loved the movie and likes Abba.

B003UCPEJ2|5.0|Mamma mia!  Where do I begin?  This is an astounding value.  60 CDs for such a low price and with incredible sound.  I've often thought that the RCA Red Seal records of the 50s and 60s had the best sound of the early to mid stereo era.  Clear, clean, un-gimmicked and not gussied up.  And what talents! Reiner, Munch, Stowkowski, Heifetz, Cliburn, Rubinstein, Price, Tebaldi, and it goes on and on.  Decades after they were first recorded, many of these performances are still considered essential interpretations, and some are still the best versions available.  For example, it is pretty hard to disagree with those who say the Turandot is one of the half dozen or so greatest studio recordings of any opera ever made.  I have not found a turkey in the whole box.  I was familiar with the majority of these performances and have many of them on LP but they never sounded this good.  I am enjoying some surprises, too.  I am a big fan of Pierre Monteux but had never heard this version of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony before.  A moving and tasteful performance in quite good sound for 1955.  There are still lots of Living Stereo disks out there....let's have Volume Two soon.
B004JAUCQE|4.0|Part of how you'll feel about Several Shades of Why depends on how you feel about [[ASIN:B000BV7TVQ J + Friends Sing + Chant for Amma]]. Several Shades of Why is a much more complex album than that was, but the low mood of Amma is the tone J is setting here. If you prefer your Dinosaur Jr to be more aggressive, this isn't your album. That said, I really adore Several Shades of Why. It's quieter tone doesn't change the essential ability of J to set an emotional mood through repetition and serious guitar work. I would still give [[ASIN:B000L43ND6 More Light]] the top spot for a solo album, but I'd make a strong argument that Several Shades of Why beats [[ASIN:B0026T4RPC Farm]], a fine album in it's own right. Sample Listen To Me and What Happened (the albums bookends) to decide. Not a series of highs and lows and singles but an extended mood from beginning to end, Several Shades of Why is a beautiful work but not one meant for shuffle play.

I opened the DVD yesterday and went straight to \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" because I love seeing the Fab 4 in their white tails coming down that large staircase. Well, keep the VHS tape and don't bother to get the DVD; I could not see any of the faces of the Beatles or even of the crowd. The picture was so washed out - grainy - blurry - couldn't see their faces as I said - and had a slightly out-of-focus look.

0385341008|5.0|This an incredible book. It starts out as a series of innocent but witty letters between a literary society in Guernsey and a London author but turns into something much more serious yet still heartwarming when the history of WW2 unfolds. This amazing book made me laugh out loud, shocked me and made me cry real tears.<br />The characters are beautifully written. The group from Guernsey reminded me very much of those earthy, eccentric but utterly wonderful characters from the TV series Vicar of Dibley and the setting and history of post war Guernsey was really brought to life. The plot develops beautifully and it has a strong storyline which makes it a real page turner despite being arranged as a series of letters. I can't think of anything of this book not to love. It celebrates great books and authors as well as being a prime example of what makes a great book itself. You must read it. Highly recommended.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Like a million people I heard and still listen to his 70's and 80's songs on a regular basis. But through the 90's and beyond I kinda lost track of Bruce. I'm sure I speak for alot of people. Enter 2007, I'm listening to internet radio and keep hearing \\"Livin' In The Future\\" and \\"Radio Nowhere\\" over and over...and loving them. To my ears they're the most energetic and infectious songs of his in years. Ordered the album and quickly came to love the rest also. What man can't enjoy \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\"? I also really like \\"You'll Be Comin' Down\\" and \\"Long Walk Home\\". I liked this album so much I bought the following album \\"Workin' On A Dream\\" too, though it's not as good as this is. If you've heard \\"Born To Run\\" one too many times and need a more recent Bruce fix, this will work some magic on you.
1416960953|5.0|This field guide to accompany the Spiderwick stories is an amazingly beautifully written and illustrated guide to invisible magical creatures like Brownies, Boggarts, Piskies, Gargoyles, Banshees, Changelings, Pixies, Salamanders, Phookas, Dragons, Giants, Goblins, Merfolk, Sea Serpents etc and some wonderful rare creatures like the 'Stray Sod' who will make you chuckle.<br /><br />It's an A4 sized book in the style of a really old journal with browned pages and picture plates. Some of the inner pages open upwards and some double fold outwards. The content can't be faulted, really it is truly magical. Letters and old newspaper stories interweave the descriptions giving it a real journal feel.<br /><br />The only slight gripe I have is is the modern presentation. The dust jacket is thin paper and easily damaged. It is also really flat apart from a slightly raised round part of the seal which may disappoint a child who has seen the book in the film version. The cover is different underneath and in the same style as another Spiderwick book the 'Notebook of Fantastical Observations'cover. It is a shame when a book looks better without it's dustjacket. An older style cover with a removable warning card and some ribbon would have done wonders to the outer presentation. The inner pages which open out are also slightly badly designed. I found it impossible to open the 'old wyrm dragon' page upwards without sligthly ripping it as it was such a close fit to the spine. I think younger children might have a problem opening and folding the pages without leaving them crumpled and ripped.<br /><br />100/100 for content but it is let down slightly by the presentation. It could have been even more wonderful.

1401302378|3.0|In his book \\"The Long Tail,\\" Chris Anderson illustrates that the future of business will rely on selling less of more.  By utilizing the statistical concept of Pareto Tails, Anderson argues that companies should focus on selling niche products rather than the traditional business approach of primarily selling popular products deemed as \\"hits.\\"  The author depicts \\"hit\\" products as the area under the head of a statistical curve with the highest amount of concentration points and niche products as the \\"long tail\\" of low frequency events that never seems to end. Anderson's main concept relies on the theory that the aggregate total of the low frequency events (niche products) will be greater than the densely populated head of the graph (hit products).  However, this concept is only possible given today's digital business structure.  Traditional brick and mortar retail stores rely heavily on the 80/20 business rule that states that 80% of revenue will come from 20% of products.  Anderson argues that due to democratization of production tools, minimization of distribution costs, and communication between online consumers, retailers should focus on the 98% Rule.  The 98% Rule states that 98% of all possible choices are chosen at least once.  While traditional retailers are limited by space and resources to carry only the most popular products, digital retailers are able to focus on selling a variety of niche products.  In the book, Anderson uses a variety of companies such as Amazon, Rhapsody, and NetFlix to exemplify his thesis.  He emphasizes the importance of filters to help direct consumers towards appropriate products, and claims that recommendations from other consumers are a vital component to the future of business.<br />Overall, I thought that \\"The Long Tail\\" was a good read for any business student or professional.  The book become relatively redundant once I understood his main objective, but his culturally relevant examples helped bring his points to life.  Anderson makes many interesting points regarding both the future of business and the general trends of society as a whole.  However, I do think he undervalues the importance of \\"hit\\" products.  While I understand the significance of catering towards niche markets, \\"hit\\" products will always be wildly successful.  Must-have products establish a commonality amongst groups of and are typically the reason consumers are searching sites such as Amazon in the first place.  Only once a consumer is drawn to the internet for a product, can filters and consumer noise along the long tail be effective.  Catering towards numerous niche markets may enable companies to be timeless and never die with a particular fad, but I do believe there is still plenty of merit behind producing a \\"hit.\\"son makes many interesting points regarding both the future of business and the general trends of society as a whole.

The story line is so interesting and the ending of each episode is always so exciting that you want to continue watching and see how the story progresses. The actors are wonderful!

Of course, I love that the ending is a happy one.<br />I intend to watch this over and over! A must-see for period movie lovers!
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|I thought this CD started off weak...two of the first three tracks were pretty generic and \\"Care\\" sounded pretty syrupy...but kicking off with the 4th song...\\"Purple Sky\\" all the way through to the end was some really good rootsy-country rock. Kid Rock sounds like the real deal. \\"Rock On\\" sounds heartfelt while both the guitar and organ are just oozing soul. Kid Rock shockingly sings in the falsetto key on \\"For The First Time\\" and sounds surprisingly good. Play it to your friends and say \\"guess who?\\" and you will stump them every time.    And Kid has a kick ass band behind him with Dave Hildago (Los Lobos) on guitar, Benmont Tench (Tom Petty) on keys, Chad Smith (RHCP) on drums and even Bob Seger sits in on piano on one cut. Plus duets with Sheryl Crow and Martina McBride.
B004J713JW|5.0|THIS LONG CONCERT JUST FLEW BY FOR ME.  I read all the various criticisms of different aspects of the Blu Ray disc sound track.  Most of them were well founded.  The sound was extremely good, but the mix wasn't at times.  They obviously emphasized the singer, but took turns turning down the mikes on the drums, backup singers, and sometimes the brass.  The video was top notch.    That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Billy is not a spring chicken, and appears especially heavy.  With all that, he put on a great show for all of us.    What a great career.  Sometimes I forget how many big hits he has had over the years. We can pick all we want, but in the end, it really made a great night enjoying this terrific performer. Whomever puts together these shows for release on blu ray ought to have this edited edition, and the full concert.  As long as it was already done, why cut anything out?

B002ZG99TA|1.0|Unstoppable? Try Unwatchable. If you want to see a great movie about a runaway train, do yourself a favor and don't watch this mess. Watch the 1985, thrice Oscar-nominated, \\"Runaway Train\\" with Jon Voight and Eric Roberts instead. \\"Unstoppable\\" has plot holes you could drive a, um, er, I suppose, um, a TRAIN through, actually. They got so much factually wrong that it totally countermands what little they got right. I know there's a certain suspension of disbelief required for most if not all action films and I accept that wholeheartedly but this movie doesn't require suspension of disbelief, it requires suspension of most if not all cognative skill. Yes, Denzel is good, he's ALWAYS good, and yes, there's plenty of quick-cut action, but NO, helicopters do NOT constantly fly at great speed a mere fifteen or twenty feet off the ground just so they can CONSTANTLY appear in panning shots of equally swift locomotives. Is it a train movie? Is it a helicopter movie? Heck, it's BOTH!! You want to watch a great film about a runaway train? Trust me, get a copy of RUNAWAY TRAIN!
0316077054|5.0|Before reading Beautiful Darkness I had already heard that it was suppose to be even better than Beautiful Creatures but I was still skeptical about it, it's sometimes hard to find a sequel that's better than the first or that even comes close to being as good as the first book in the series. Beautiful Darkness is one of those, it's one of the exceptions, like some of my other favorite series Beautiful Darkness was quite amazing and I ended up loving it a lot more than Beautiful Creatures.<br /><br />In Beautiful Creatures we got the background and history of the town of Gatlin and the introduction of the characters established so when you start reading Beautiful Darkness the story begins at a very fast pace a few months after from where Beautiful Creatures ended. Lena blames herself for the death of her uncle and starts alienating herself from those around her. I was a little frustrated with Lena in this one, since we don't really know the reason behind her new rebellious attitude, we only get poor Ethan's point of view in the story  and we feel his pain and frustration, how he's not willing to give her up and let her go even when he starts thinking the worst. We also get introduced to a couple of new characters, the hot and mysterious John Breed who nobody seems to know exactly what he is, and a new girl named Liv smart and beautiful with a sense of adventure that I really liked.<br /><br />I really loved that we get to see a lot more of  feisty Amma's awesome seer power and we also get a lot of scenes with Link and his crazy funny sense of humor. Even when you thought the darkest part of the story was coming up or someone was going to die Link would say the funniest lines and made me laugh, I think he's becoming my new favorite character.<br /><br />What I loved the most about Beautiful Darkness was how I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next, it's definitely full of mystery, surprises, and twists that keep you on your toes while you're reading it and just wanting to flip the pages as fast as you can. Kami and Margie have an amazing talent at weaving all these details through the story perfectly that it just keeps you guessing until the end where it all makes sense somehow. The rich descriptions are there just like with the first one, they made it so easy to picture the places and scenes in my head along with the very well written characters that you can easily feel a connection with, they just feel so alive and their emotions so real that I just didn't want it to end. I should warn you that this book will give you the urge to bake and search the internet for pie recipes. I loved it and I definitely recommend it, the ending will leave you wanting to bribe Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl for the next book right away!lip the pages as fast as you can.

0525423273|5.0|Please excuse the gush fest that is about to begin but wow! what an amazing debut novel by Stephanie Perkins. I had been dying to read this book since I heard so many positive things about it and so many people raving over it and let me tell you that Anna and the French Kiss does live up to its hype and way exceeded my expectations. I loved it!!! (I also apologize for the huge amount of exclamation points)<br /><br />I actually got teary eye a couple of times while reading it but it was from happiness, I completely immersed myself into the story that I felt very emotional and had a huge grin on my face when things would start looking up for Anna and St. Claire(Etienne). It was filled with romantic scenes that I hadn't even realized how much I've been missing this kind of romance in books lately until after I finished reading this one. The way we can get to see the main characters develop their relationship and actually see them slowly falling in love with each other, I think that's what I love the most.<br /><br />Now about the love interest in the story, Etienne (I'm calling him by his first name cause I luvs him!) he was just sooo charming that he would just make me swoon just like he did with Anna (Yes, you read right I said swoon!). At the beginning I didn't think I would like him because it's repeatedly mentioned on the book that he is very short and I do not like short, but once I got to know his character a little more I completely forgot about the height problem and overlooked it, he was just wonderful.<br /><br />I have never wanted to go to Paris believe it or not, but the rich descriptions of the atmosphere, the food and the places that Anna talks about just made me changed my mind and I wish was there now. I loved pretty much everything about this book Anna and St. Claire, the chemistry, the romance, and even the side characters that complimented the story perfectly. I definitely recommend you add this one to your Christmas list if you don't have it on there yet.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|This is a window into today's youth culture.    Easy A is Olive's (Emma Stone) confession about a rumor that she inadvertently started about herself. Throughout the recap of events, Olive speaks to the camera as if she were posting this on a youtube-like website.    While trying to have a conversation with her annoying best friend, Olive lies and says she had sex with her date (who happens to be totally made up). The school Christian overhears them and the rumor-mill takes over.    Before long, the entire school knows and Olive decides to play the role of School Harlot.    When the school outcasts come to her and ask for her \\"pretend hookups\\", things get worse; the lying ends up destroying a marriage.    Despite the humor, and this film is laugh-out-loud hilarious, there are some strong language issues and the sex humor is a little too much. But again, this is revealing the culture our youth are in.    By far, my favorite actors were Thomas Hayden Church as the English teacher Mr. Griffith and Stanley Tucci as Olive's dad, Dill.    All in all, this would make a great \\"conversation\\" movie for families. Although I know most teens abhor the idea of talking about movies with their parents.

B000002H48|5.0|1979. That was a long time ago. We were young. We were worried about nuclear power plants. This was months after Three Mile Island. Now look where we are with Japan after the earthquake. It was a simpler time - Remember, the 60's mostly happened in the 70's, and the late 70's weren't the 80's yet, so we still thought we could change the world :)<br /><br />But enough about that. This was a great concert (I saw it at the Hollywood Bowl), and a great album. What a lineup! Doobies, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, CSN, Springsteen at the height of his powers, Tom Petty (New guy - he only had two albums out at the time...), plus Gil Scott-Heron, Ry Cooder, and Jesse Colin Young. Chaka Khan (this was when disco still sucked) and Sweet Honey on the Rock, too..<br /><br />Some great pairings here with Jackson Brown and Graham Nash doing beautiful harmonies on \\"The Crow On The Cradle\\" (30 years later, another great version by JB and David Lindley on another fantastic live album - Love Is Strange), James Taylor, Carly Simon, and Graham Nash on \\"The Times They Are A-Changin\\" and you gotta love \\"Stay\\" with Jackson, Bruce, and the E Street Band! Great versions of Runaway, Angel From Mongomery, Cathedral, You Don't Have to Cry and Captain Jim's Drunken Dream are some of the highlights.<br /><br />Glad I found this on CD. Thanks Amazon. Can't get it on iTunes and the booklet brings back a lot of memories.

030746363X|2.0|If you are a young, hip tech oriented person the odds are good that you've heard a lot about this book and it's author. Say what you want about him, but he's a master of marketing and self promotion and did a fantastic job of getting the word out. I think, for that reason, this book will appeal to a lot of folks in the tech circles, as they look up to one of their own who has made it big. But can it justify the hype? I don't think so. There's nothing really wrong with this book. If you follow the diet advice you will lose weight. How? Through calorie restriction, just like every other diet. Yes yes, the type of food you eat makes a difference, but that doesn't change the fact that you are still restricting calories.    I'm going to mostly focus on the diet here, because I think it's what most people will buy the book for, and I think a lot of the rest is mostly fluff (I had friends doing the uberman sleep schedule in the late 90's). Here's the thing, his diet plan is just a low carb diet. There is quite a bit of research out there that supports the idea that low carb is the best way to lose fat, that insulin response is important, etc. I tend to agree with these findings. However, it's not the closed case that low carb promoters will have you believe. The jury is still out, and at the end of the day any calorie restricted diet is likely to be effective (though potentially some more than others).    There is one big problem with a low carb diet however, and that is, it's difficult to eat enough. If you are shooting for say 1,800 calories a day that amounts to 10 cups of broccoli and 5 chicken breasts. Now can you imagine eating that in one day? Heck no! When you limit the carbs and stick to clean, lean protein and whole veggies, it's *really* hard to consume enough calories. For that reason, the low carbers all recognize you've got to do something to make up for the lack of carbs and add calories back in (as consuming too few calories can be detrimental to weight loss). The Atkins camp does this by encouraging you to eat lots of fat, either fatty meats or dairy products. Smother that chicken in cheese, have some bacon, etc. The Paleo camp has you do it by adding in nuts and small amounts of fruits. Tim has you do it by adding in beans. Those are your 3 low carb camps today and out of all of them I tend to side with Atkins as 1) it's the tastiest option and 2) it's the only one that doesn't add significant carbs to the diet.    This is where Tim loses me a bit. Beans are a carb. Sure they have protein and fiber, but they're still a carb and have a glycemic index similar to rice. Now, I don't tend to think that cutting out all carbs is wise, so I'm just fine with this. But I think it's important to note that this is not a revolutionary diet, it's just a theme on something that has been popular for a while. If you like beans, and believe that consuming fat is bad for you (I don't), then this is probably the diet for you.    That said, after weighing it for a few days, I went from an initial excitement to try it, to deciding this just isn't for me. There are two big reasons for this... First, I hate beans. I could probably come up with some recipes for beans that I could eat a few times a week and not suffer too much, but the thought of eating beans 3 times a day is just too much for me. I would have serious compliance issues and I'm pretty sure it would fail for me. After all, if a diet requires you to eat something you don't enjoy eating, you won't stick to it. And with his diet plan, if you don't eat the beans, you won't be consuming enough calories, plain and simple. If, however, you're the type that salivates at the thought of a 3 bean salad, and could eat black beans plain out of the can, then you'll be quite pleased with this plan. If you love to whip up recipes to make beans delicious, you're right at home as well. For me, I need things quick and simple, and there's just nothing I can do to beans that is quick and simple which I will want to eat...    The second problem is that this diet is still a diet. For most people, in my opinion, it is not maintainable in the long term. Were I to force myself to go on this diet until I reach my weight loss goals, I would give it up the instant I hit my weight goal, because of that whole bean hatred thing. At that point I'd likely go back to normal eating habits and gain the weight back. I am a firm believer that rather than going on a specific diet to achieve a short term weight loss goal, you should instead build a healthy diet you can stick with indefinitely and simply work on portion control to lose weight. For most of us these changes are quite simple and involve giving up high calorie beverages, greatly reducing simple carbs and sticking to complex carbs (true whole grain bread, brown rice, oatmeal, etc), and getting plenty of lean protein and veggies. If your diet is realistic, and something that you can follow for the rest of your life, I believe it will be far more successful. Sure, it might not get you the quickest results, but it will get you the most long term results.     I do enjoy his advice about having a binge day, however again, that's not exactly a new idea. From personal experience I've found that while having a binge day does lead to an instant weight gain (2-3 lbs for me), over the long term I lose weight faster. That instant weight gain is mostly glycogen being stored up by your body (commonly known as water weight), not fat, and will quickly be depleted to be replaced by further weight loss through the next week. While tracking my weight I've found that I lose weight much faster with a binge day, and if I haven't had one but my weight loss has stalled, having a free day kicks it back in gear. Of course we are all different, but it's something I highly recommend trying to see how your body reacts.    Overall, it's a fine book. The advice is solid, and if the diet plan fits with your tastes you will have good results. But please, keep in mind that it's nothing revolutionary and you need to honestly assess whether a diet of lean meat, veggies and lots of beans is something you'll realistically be able to stick to. If not, there is no point in doing it. If it's not a diet you are likely to stick to, it's not going to work, no matter what kind of amazing results the author may present.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Around Xmas time, this cd was in the lightning deals and I previewed it.  I never got to buy it, but thought Mumford and Sons was pretty cool. When I watched them play with Dylan on the Grammys, it reminded me how much I like this band (though the performance, was eh, I dunno).  I bought the cd right after that.  Since then, I can't get through a day without listening to this album, or at least have it playing in my head in the shower or at work... Definitely one of the best and most unique new folk rock artists today.  We need more artists like these guys out there...
B000T5O48U|5.0|The film can appear quite dated when compared to some of today's (2011) more sophisticated camera wizardry.  However, the storyline and scenery used for filming make this movie eerily believable.  No ridiculous blood and guts, but all the more scary because it has an everyday feel about it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was definitely not sure when I purchased this book if I would like it or not, especially with the mixed reviews.  But, I was very surprised when I found myself engrossed in the story. My only criticism was the ending, which left me wanting so much more...I hope there is a sequel coming soon!
0307593525|5.0|Great set of books. Kind of a cooking for dummies type but its really good at defining things that help with the recepes..
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Well let me start by saying, I to was a little skeptical about the previews. I stumbled actually on the story of fringe while going through my free on demand shows from cablevision. I figuered I had nothing to lose and some time to kill. Wow!! I fell into the third season like a ton of bricks. I didn't understand what was going on so I feed my curiosity by purchasing the first season( for a great price btw..20 bucks!)AND NOW I CAN'T WATCH ENOUGH EPISODES!! I'm totally hooked on the parallel world and the characters are interesting enough to carry the stories for a long time. Good luck to the whole team and may it get more mysterious and twisty as it goes on!!
B001C08RHA|4.0|I'll be brief... First of all, I loved IRON MAN as a kid in the comic books. He has no special powers, just a really rockin' suit that kicks everyone else's butts. I never expect a superhero movie to be true to the comic... it's just not possible, but what I do expect is a quality product, a good story line, decent character development, and an ending that makes me want a sequel. This movie delivers all of those things. We see how the character of Tony Stark changes when he undergoes a traumatic event, loses the life of a friend, and has to engage with the betrayal of another friend. In all of this he grows as a person... and yet we see him struggle with how this affects his own personality. All of the while there are enough explosions, actions sequences, and high speed drama to keep me interested. I would give it 5 stars, but there were a few scenes that did drag for me. I recommend watching this movie. If you watch it with your children, be present to answer questions about violence and the difference between good and bad. Have fun.
1594132054|5.0|I'm new to examining the way our industrialized food chain works so, for me, this was an eye-opening, life-changing book. It's an excellent source of information, thought-provoking, and extraordinarily well written.

B003Y5H53S|4.0|There's a lot for adults, especially film buffs, to like about \\"Rango.\\" Rango, a lizard like no lizard you've ever seen, lives in a terrarium with a wind-up goldfish and a headless nude Barbie-style doll, acting out little dramas he dreams up with his plastic friends. One day his world is literally shattered as the terrarium falls out of the back of the family station wagon and breaks on a little-traveled road in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Rango finds himself in Dirt, a town running out of water and in desperate need of a hero. The acting skills Rango honed in his terrarium enable him to convince the townsfolk that he's a hero. Now he has to find out if he can really be the hero they need.      The plot, such as it is, is a pastiche of \\"High Noon,\\" Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, and especially \\"Chinatown.\\" If you are not familiar with these decidedly adult-oriented films, much of the pleasure of \\"Rango\\" will be lost on you. The cleverly derivative script is filled with verbal gymnastics and philosophy served up by a roadkill armadillo and a Man With No Name.     I can't even come up with a word that doesn't sound trite to describe the animation--WOW!! This is a fabulous movie to look at. Every character has so much detail and originality. Coen Brothers stalwart Roger Deakins acted as the cinematography consultant and it shows in every frame. Johnny Depp heads a voice cast of great actors including Ned Beatty and Harry Dean Stanton.     \\"Rango\\" has enough physical humor and action to keep my eight-year-old entertained, but I know many of the jokes and all of the classic film references went over his head. The language is nothing my kid does not hear in a traffic jam, and to the extent the humor is crude, it is usually expressed with such sophisticated wordplay that I did not find it particularly offensive. There was a big chase scene, a cast-of-thousands set piece of the type in which director Gore Verbinski specializes in the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" that is uncomfortably violent. There are also pleasantly surprising moments of quiet reflection and introspection that, based on the relatively cartoonish quality of the \\"Pirates\\" movies, I did not expect from Verbinski.     I can enthusiastically recommend Rango for film buffs and for kids whose parents are not highly protective when it comes to mild swearing and violence. I ended with a four-star rating because, although Rango is surprisingly thoughtful and beautifully done in many ways, it bothered me that instead of having a wholly original story, they cobbled the script together from the plots of other movies. Forget it Jake. It's Chinatown.
0060734191|5.0|Part steampunk, part high magick, part fantasy. The books are 100% awesome. The world is not only extremely fleshed out, but the characters are deep, compelling, and put in the position to need to make very difficult choices. From gliding along in a Paperwing, to the discovery of Yreal the eighth bright shiner, and beyond. This is one of my favorite trilogies of all time.
B002PJN59M|4.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film, while excellent, does not really follow \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" by Sir Thomas Malory. for instance, Arthur does not sleep with Morgana, but his other half-sister Margawse (and that happens early on in the story). and the tale of Tristan & Iseult is' completely omitted, as is the fight between Sir Accolon & Arthur, the fight with the kings, Sir Balin/Sir Balan, etc. but it's a good movie. Just forget that Le Morte D'Arthur was ONE OF THE SOURCES used as the basis for this film. I've yet to see a film version that follows Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur closely. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.

B002JCSRKC|1.0|I have two pairs of crocs shoes and love them! I thought I would find the same comfort with crocs rain boots, but was very disappointed. They are very stiff through the leg and ankle, make noise with each step (clicking, thump sound) and are uncomfortable in the foot (not cushiony like the shoes). I returned them and will continue my search for comfortable rain boots.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a wonder job in this movie and certainly deserved her best actress nomination.  Except for the sex of the two children, this movie did a great job following the book.  I love this film.
0307408833|4.0|5/6 of my family is vegan, and 1/2 of us have a wheat intolerance.  I got this book just in time for my oldest's 17th birthday, and I was really excited to make the Paradise Cake.  And... it was okay, bordering on kind of dry.  We put it away, then discovered the next morning that it had improved with refrigeration- both softer and sweeter.  Go figure.  That motivated me to give some of the other recipes a try.<br /><br />My daughter tried the Vanilla Cupcakes as they were written up in the book.  They were not that great.  But I raised my eyebrow a bit when I saw how many recipes used applesauce.  Years ago, I learned in an issue of Cooking Light that if you're going to use applesauce the best way to do it is to drain it, usually by spreading it out on paper towels (I use old paper bags).  The amount of moisture that comes out is impressive, and as most whole-grain bakers know, moisture paradoxically makes baked goods denser.  I tried both the Chocolate and Vanilla Cupcakes using my technique, and the results were fabulous.  (So much so that I couldn't save enough cupcakes to make crumbs that time around.)  Why McKenna doesn't mention this, I don't know.<br /><br />The frosting recipes are good- easily the best I've seen without confectioners sugar- but some people are not going to love the taste of the soymilk powder.  I've cut back with good results.  Experienced cooks are going to recommend the technique as the same one used to make mayonnaise.  I will note that even after chilling the frosting is still more of a thick sauce- until you stir just a touch more liquid into it.  For vanilla, it was food coloring, for chocolate just a touch of coffee did the trick.  If you want pure vanilla frosting, maybe some extra vanilla will do the trick.<br /><br />I have nothing but good things to say about the biscuits, johnny cakes (a new family favorite), lemon poppy cake, corn bread and banana bread.  So nice to have baked goods like this for breakfast and snacks.  The brownies are also delicious.  Don't be freaked out by the specific instructions about what size baking container to use.  The brownies can be baked in a brownie pan, not just muffin tins, and the loaf cakes can be baked... in a traditional loaf pan, not just the oddly-sized, small ones she specifies.  (And of course they also work very nicely as muffins too.)<br /><br />The ingredients she calls for are expensive (welcome to wheat-free baking), so most people are going to be loath to experiment.  As such, it would have been nice if McKenna had explained some of her recipe choices, particularly the need for hot water.  Does hot water activate the baking powder or soda more quickly?  Is it safer to use because you're not working with as much gluten?  I don't know, and an explanation would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Still, with some tweaks, this is a really great cookbook for those who can't eat wheat and don't want to use sugar.  So glad to have it in my kitchen..  Don't be freaked out by the specific instructions about what size baking container to use.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie has lots of suspense and action.  We were all spellbound by the story of this magnificent horse and its determined owner.  I will watch it again in the future.
B00013BN4S|5.0|This is my favorite Emmylou Harris album, still--more than three decades after its release.  I first heard this album in the late 1970s, and I couldn't believe the amazing mix of authentic country vocals with LA rock sound.  It's a perfect blend.  I've now owned this in three formats--vinyl album, cassette, and finally CD.  I can't live without it, and there are only a handful of artists/recordings that I feel that way about.  If you've never heard of Emmylou Harris, shame on you--she sang background vocals on so many albums (Dylan's \\"Desire\\" album, Little Feat, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, and many, many others), and never mind her solo career.  Throughout, she never lost her \\"true country\\" sound, in the best sense of the word--all heart, no glitz.  So if you're ready for a real musical treat, buy this album.  (You'll want to listen to \\"Boulder to Birmingham\\" over and over.)
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theater and had to have a copy.  I will watch it with some friends who haven't seen it.  I normally do not see movies with lots of violence, but really enjoyed this very clever movie.  Lots of twists and turns to make it interesting.
B00003CX9S|5.0|My daughter needed to watch this movie for a high school term paper.  I had no trouble finding it on Amazon and was very happy with the quick delivery.  It was exactly as described, was received even quicker than promised, and the whole ordering process was simple.  Now if only getting her to finish her term paper could go as smoothly.......
B00027JZ3E|5.0|I can't even begin to count how many copies of this movie I've had over the years. Starting with VHS and now to DVD. If you have a movie collection at home, this is one of those must have movies (True Grit, Harold & Maude, Star Wars etc...) that if not there, sorry your collection is just not complete.
0756405890|5.0|You will have heard a lot of good stuff about The Name Of The Wind. Believe all of it.    And if you've heard bad things (though I can't imagine why) remember that this is the author's first novel and he's only going to get better.    If you're uncertain about whether to buy this book, do yourself a favor and read a sample chapter.  A few paragraphs of Rothfuss' lyrical prose should be enough to convince you.    And the prose is just the beginning.  In Kvothe, Rothfuss gives us the brilliant new fantasy hero we've all been craving for.  Half Harry Potter, half Rand al'Thor, Kvothe is one of the most interesting characters I've met within the pages of a fantasy book.    The humor in the book is refreshing and original, as is the the magic system (known as sympathy) which is well thought out and makes for a great variety of applications.    For all this though, I would say the romantic aspects of the book are the best parts about it.  This is literally the first fantasy novel I have read that put together a relationship that was authentic and that I could instantly relate to.    Lastly I would say if you like Harry Potter, you'll love this book.  If you ever wondered what it would be like if Harry attended a University of Magic, look no further than this one.    Buy the book.  You won't regret it.    Rating: 9.75/10.
1400052173|5.0|This a great book about the life of Henrietta Lacks and her HeLa cells I am half way through the book and can't seem to put it down it's very interesting in a social, historic and scientific way. Everyone should read it.
0756404738|4.0|Characters    This book continues the story as Kvothe records his life story while talking to his apprentice Bast and Chronicler.  Kvothe doesn't really undergo much of a growth arc throughout this book, but this is understandable when given some thought.  Even though we do change as we grow older, looking back on our life, as Kvothe is doing, it is very difficult to see this change over time in ourselves.  The story also spends a fair amount of time dealing with the relationship between Kvothe and Denna as well as the different people Kvothe interacts with at the University and abroad, some of the scenes with Elodin lead to very interesting exchanges as well.    Setting    Kvothe spends the first third of the book recounting more of his time at the University, which makes sense as it was the major part of his life at the time he is recounting, but it was irritating to me at times.  From the very beginning of the first book we are told of some of his deeds throughout the world, and unfortunately most of these actions don't take place at the University, so we need to get him away from the University before we can get to hear about all of those adventures.  Eventually we get to several other large towns and eventually to lands well away from the university and even into other realms.    Plot    Much like the first book, there are two different plots going on at once, there is the frame story where Kvothe is reciting his story to Chronicler and Bast as well as the story he is telling them.  The flashback story is entertaining especially towards the later parts of the book where we get to see how Kvothe helps to shape his identity by nudging exaggerations of some of stories as well as just through his actions.  Rothfuss does an excellent job of showing how stories get blown out of proportion to the extent that they do.  While Kvothe is a very smart character who has a lot of knowledge about the workings of the world, he is nowhere near as powerful as many of the storiestold about him make him out to be.    At the end of The Name of the Wind and at times in The Wise Man's Fear, we are brought back to present day and shown some of the problems Kvothe is facing.  As I finished NotW and several times in this story, I was more interested in the frame story than the story that Kvothe is telling about his past.  We are shown all of these fantastic things that Kvothe has done through his life, all that he has learned and studied, and he is shown to be somewhat depressed and reluctant to deal with life's problems.  What happened to Kvothe to cause him to get this way?  Where is Denna?  As interesting as Kvothe's past is, I want to know more about what is going on now.  I understand that we're getting there in the story, but I suppose I'm impatient.    Enjoyment    Although I have my complaints about the story that I said above, I still liked the book.  While I didn't tear through it as fast as I have some other books, I did really enjoy the story as well as reading about Kvothe's cleverness in dealing with his problems.  There were times when it slowed down a bit, however, those were mostly in the beginning when he was still at the University.  The frame story left me wanting to read more about Kvothe because I want to know what happened to the cocky kid who wanted all the knowledge in the world and how he came to settle as an innkeeper.  I will be eagerly awaiting the next book and highly suggest the series to anyone who enjoys fantasy books.    Overall Grade    8/10
B000ZLFALI|4.0|If you like the movie Momma Mia and you like the Beatles music, you will enjoy this movie.  The singers have good arrangements for their respective voices and there is some really good choreograpthy in some sections.  If you wish you had gone to Woodstock you'll enjoy it.

B003MX5P20|5.0|Enrique Iglesias's latest album \\"Euphoria\\" is nothing short of amazing. Roughly half of the tracks are in English and the other half is in Spanish, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This choice showcases his vocal ability in all of the songs. Well, almost. The hit `I Like It' has too much autotune for my taste, but the catchiness of it makes up for it.    My favorite Spanish track on the album is `Tú y Yo (You and I).' It's very mellow and beautiful in general. `Cuándo Me Enamoro (When I Fall in Love)' is also memorable, especially with Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra as a guest vocalist. My favorite English track is `Dirty Dancer,' which has Usher as a guest and simply screams hit single.    What I love most about this album is that it has a good range of songs. Some are mellow like `Tú y Yo' and others are dance tracks such as `Heartbeat' and `I Like It.' Enrique has definitely done well with his efforts. Whenever I listen to this album, I can't help but smile. It's so upbeat and fun. I just hope Enrique releases a complete Spanish album again because he's just irresistible when singing in his native language.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I love this book because of unpredictable conclusion.  In addition, I strongly recommend this book to people who are a beginner in English.
0756404738|4.0|I enjoyed the first book much more. Where did the main plot go? Are Felurian, the Adem, and even that new board game  he learns about more important to the plot than the Chandrian?     How will the author fit everything in the last book when it seems he has trouble deciding what to leave in and what not?    Certain parts dragged on for way too long without explaining some key mysteries. For example,I can't imagine how Auri's story will be concluded in the third book or if it is even important enough for it to be. There are just so  many plot threads that need to be tied together before the end of the third book that it seems some stuff will be left off or be explained \\"off camera.\\"     With all that said, the book was certainly enjoyable. I like Rothfuss' writing style and the world and mysteries he has created in the book. I just feel that the book would have been so much better with  better editing or if this was not the 2nd book of a trilogy but the 2nd book out of a 10 book series.
B004PP15NC|5.0|This was such a fun episode! I loved every minute of it. And it's great how they wrapped up all(most) of the pieces. I especially loved the home video at the end. Watching Tom get to be Tom in a drunken stupor was hilarious. P.S. Great run in with the wall, Clark.
1591843790|5.0|This is a quick read because of its clarity in message. It is not enough to ask - you need to compel; not enough to practice - you need to participate; I think what Guy Kawasaki does so well is to move you to confront your own from the wrist behaviors and make them more meaningful to the people you are trying to move to action. Encounters can grow into relationships; relationships into partnerships in changing the world one action or behavior shift at a time.<br /><br />This book is a must read for every marketer; every business person... every human being.<br /><br />What is the most important thing we could be discussing today? How to be enchanting; what enchantment could achieve - who should be enchanting?
B000002TLX|4.0|i forgot how many good songs he sings this was the best cd i have purchesed in a long time
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Overall, this is a very good book.  Excellent writing.  It is a LONG narrative but feels shorter than it is.  I read the first book \\"Name of the Wind\\" a couple years ago and really enjoyed it.  I've been waiting for the sequel and for the most part was not disappointed.    The caveat is that I agree with other reviewers that the story is really a \\"bridge\\" between books 1 and 3.  It is a  GOOD bridge story, but not much substantive happens to advance the key parts of the story like the Chandrian, Kvothes relationship with Denna, his battles with Ambrose, or his education at the University.  It could be summarized as \\"Kvothe goes on spring break, has some interesting adventures, learns to fight, discovers sex, and then returns to almost exactly where he was at the start of the story\\".    I find myself now wanting to read book 3... and hope it won't be several years until it comes out.  I want to read the conclusion.
1591843790|5.0|Enchantment is sort of an organizational \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" for people doing business in this digital age.    The book's basic theme is that we need to win people relationally, if they are going to join with us.  Guy then gives tons of practical insights on developing positive winsomeness.    I really appreciate Guy's user friendly and down to earth persective, which applies well to any organization or business, including churches and other non-profits.    I suppose you could call it a handy guide for common sense and being likeable.  Good stuff, and I know a few of people who could definitely use that!
B004RL9T50|3.0|Once it's over it's forgettable. This movie didn't have the humor we were expecting or characters that were endearing. It's just ok if you want to see it but if we hadn't seen it we would not have missed anything.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I enjoy anime and this is one of the better titles I have come across.  There was an actual plot with a good story instead of the mass screaming of excitable half naked characters.
B004GHBQPG|5.0|Lovely renditions of some old standards. Beautiful arrangements but marked poignancy in the fading voice. Fading it may have been but it lost none of that beautiful timbre unique to Johnny Cash. This album is for listening to in mellow mood. It might even cause the odd teardrop but it is one for the collection.
0143113100|5.0|In this book, Dr. Doidge describes how the old assertions that the brain doesn't grow new cells, that it cannot repair itself, nor adapt in adulthood are completely contradicted by laboratory science. In a clear and delightful prose, Doidge tells about the pioneers of neuroplasticity and provides both their theories and real-world examples to elaborate them. The outcome is an optimistic view of human potential that not only engages the reader, but challenges us to push ourselves past what we believe are our limits and never give up.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|From the author of a #1 New York bestseller Mystic River, Dennis Lehane brings you a terrifying, mysterious thriller. Page after page, Shutter Island keeps you engrossed as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels investigates the hidden truth of Shutter Island. Battling hurricanes, suspicious doctors, even the disappearance of his partner, Daniels finds himself deeper into the labyrinth of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. Daniels often wondered, \\"The lighthouse beyond, out of service since the Civil War, rendered obsolete by the beam of Boston Light. What purpose could it have? What purpose?\\" Could this be the place of the medical experiments? Lehane incorporates mind-boggling twists for a brilliantly suspenseful outcome.<br />I particularly enjoyed how Lehane described each character as to make them a real person. This novel is well written and will expand one's vocabulary. I like to read mystery books as they take wild turns and plots thicken. The one thing I wish Lehane did differently was use other words of stress. The F-word was used quite frequently. The story was phenomenal but the swear words were quite heavy.<br />I would recommend this book to those that are ready to work with U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels to unravel the truth of Shutter Island.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I have had a subtle fascination about North Korea since I saw a National Geographic documentary some years ago.  This book was recommended by a friend who shares that same fascination and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone & everyone who will listen.  The fact that I'm even writing a review is a testament to the resonance which this book left me with.  Shocking, moving, horrifying, incredible, and heartbreaking are a few of the emotions you will be overwhelmed with as you turn the pages.  When you finish the book, you will not be the same person, nor will you read the newspaper or watch the news online & TV in the same way.  This would be an incredible book if it were fiction, but knowing that all of the details are a reality half-way around the world make you question your role and duty as a individual and humanitarian within our society.
0307276902|4.0|I purchased the book as it was on a list that I have of books recommended.  I liked that it was so realistic. I wondered if it could be true. Having very little knowledge of this lifestyle I couldn't be sure but it seems to be possible.  It is written differently that any other book I've read so I feel it's unique.  It does have strong language. It is not for the faint hearted.
1907016414|4.0|Girl Trade shows an added maturity in  Chloe's writing.  I read the book on a one hour forty minute flight back to Span, caught and carried by this roller coaster of an erotic novel.  Once settled in back home I read it again to savour the sensuality of the sex scenes, and the richness of the descriptive prose. A jewel of a book and a welcome addition to my bedside Chloe Thurlow Collection. When are these books going to appear on film, that's what i want to know!?
