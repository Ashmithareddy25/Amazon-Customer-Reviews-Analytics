B005K17RU0|4.0|Downloaded and installed free version on my Kindle Fire with no problems whatsoever.  Whenever I use AccuWeather it seems to function as I would expect for this kind of app which is more than I can say for many (even paid) apps or for that matter the Fire itself.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a story AND all so true - what a DOG!!  ALL dog lovers need to watch this amazing relationship with Hachi and his master.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I quite enjoy the challenge this game gives you as you progress farther down the line. There was a learning curve to completely understand how it was played, but the game progresses appropriately. I do not think they give the best instructions but, as I said, it progresses at such a rate you can figure it out.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I have ben a fan of Sade for a long time now. However, this blue-ray disc has blown me away. Simply put it is EXCELLENT!!!!  What a great production, and to see the group really rocking and enjoying themselves is a gift to cherish. You will not be dissapointed, see, hear!!!! Just the openning with the light show and the band entrance is great!!!!
B004QL7K6G|1.0|Not funny,bad story,ect.. Save your money! You will thank me later :-) if you wanna laugh look elsewhere..its not here
0345803485|1.0|Awful book.  I can't top any of these hilarious one-star reviews, so I won't try to.  I can't believe I made it through this incredibly unbelievable story.  I find the five-star reviews very entertaining.  To each their own, but I found the writing very childlike, repetitive, and boring.  YAWN......
B006OCM0G0|5.0|the game is great! !! love it! and its free!!! you have the choice of buying things if you want its really not that complicated....and for your kids you can disable the game for purchases
B007G5O3K0|5.0|This album feels like something that is out of time, something that has pieces of all his previous work with a-ha, as a solo artist.  His voice is sweet and pure, his nuclear powered falsetto is as strong and flexible as ever.  The music is 2000's electropop, filtered through the experience of a synth pop legend--the synthesizers feel like Scoundrel Days, but the electronic overlays feel more modern.  Lyrically, the songs are enjoyable, but it is the union of Morten's magical voice and the lyrics that make them transcend pop music tropes and pull them into the realm of wonder.  Honestly, I haven't heard him this engaged, this free in so long.  I bought this album out of a sense of loyalty, but I have kept playing it because Morten has--once more--reminded me that he is a unique and incredibly talented singer, interpreter, and songwriter who has something to add.  This album is a sure buy for any old school a-ha fan, and any long term Morten follower cannot be without it.  I think that there are easily 4-5 singles that would do well across the globe as well.  I wish him the very best of luck, and I'm going to keep listening to this for a long time.
0345803507|2.0|Yet another book that tries to romantacize controlling behavior. I guess she must be his match because she 'sometimes' stands up to him- sort of. The graphic sex scenes are fantastic but let's be real, that's the only real selling point to this book. You could read free erotic fiction online instead.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One was such a amazing book and Nicholas Sparks did a fantastic job at putting this story together.<br />The  whole idea of finding such a small valuable thing that saves your life is awesome. I really enjoyed this book and you should get it.
0345803485|1.0|Like many I have heard so much about this book and brought it on my Kindle fire to see what all the hype was about. I think this book was to long and the same thing over and over again, Found it over rated and boring. Nothing sexy or sexual about it in my eyes. I also find the writter has no clue about the subject she wrote about.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Title explains it all. The glitch is game-breaking. It happens eventually- even if y'all don't see it at first<br />-___-
B004P4S4NM|4.0|I enjoy listening to this talented young women. Most of the songs are good a few self indulgent but that is OK the rest were what I expect from her..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book hooks you from the first page. The characters are likable and believable. There are no slow parts here. A fast exciting read you won't be able to put down! I read this after seeing the movie and it followed pretty close. A good action story.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I LOVE this game but completed it months ago... PLEASE add some more puzzles!!! I'm going through some serious withdrawal :)
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This keep my CPU cool to around 40- 47*C with an overclocked  i7 2600K to 4GHz. I wanted to add a second 120mm fan on the opposite side to make a \\"push and pull\\" system, but my RAM was in the way. Had to settle with one fan for now. This product is cheap and get the jobs done.
B0032SQCQI|4.0|It seems to me the people who hate this movie don't get it. As if you shouldn't be punished for accepting a million dollars for someone else's life. I'm a huge fan of the SAW movies. If you like the premise of Saw, you'll most likely like this.<br /><br />There are things that don't make sense & I plan on watching it again some time & will probably be able to put more of the pieces together.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I decided to upgrade my computer from a first generation i5 to this baby. The i7 2600K is what i was searching for, was able to overclock this chip to 4.3Ghz and still running stable. In addition to aftermarket cooling systems the CPU heated up to about 40-47*C. No bad at all.
B001KMB6VE|3.0|if nothing else- I like seeing a science fiction film that's set in and around the Soviet Union.  Maybe it's because culturally America assayed it's doom so thoroughly in the cinema of the 70s, whereas post collapse Russia isn't just sci-fi, it's a social reality that in sci-fi terms feels more genuine.  So Vin Diesel is a mercenary for hire who has to escort a young nun and guardian across Serbia and points in between to New York city.  She may be carrying a viral bomb, or some genetic miracle.<br /><br />To his credit, Vin Diesel, sans the Riddick get-up, DOES look like he could kill somebody barehanded, it does come across, and it works, even if it's his stock and trade.  The thing is, a film like \\"Children of Men\\" touched on these themes, and did it with bold excellence as a refugee story and got alot of good press.  And the press doesn't like films that come in second with similar material.  But in it's defense, Babylon A.D. is not social commentary sci-fi, it's an adventure film.  It's not a better movie, and it doesn't try to dig into some deeper social relevance.  But it's NOT a dumb action movie, either.  The characters have a little more depth that I was expecting, and I found myself feeling happily unsure of what was actually going on during the climactic shootout in NY, only to feel really hooked by the film in it's last 20 minutes, as the political plot subtexts began to play out.. it got interesting.  For a wild cameo I applaud Charlotte Rampling for going all out as a corporate church heavy bad guy.  What a joy to see her plug somebody with a Desert Eagle and *spoiler alert* NUKE Gerard Depardieu.<br /><br />Thumbs up.<br /><br />Babylon A.D. is not a groundbreaking science fiction film.  It's a genre film.  But it's above average.  It's just not Children of Men, and that's why it got trashed.  Give it a look.<br /><br />The quality of the bluray image is very handsome, btw, although much of the film features alot of earth tones, especially in the Soviet section of the film.iet section of the film.
0920668372|1.0|I'm sorry, but I have to share that I think this is the creepiest kid's book I have ever read. It was given to me by a good lovely friend who cries when she reads this, so obviously everyone is different but I really think that the sentimentality in this book borders on bizarre in a very uncomfortable way. I have other Munsch books and they do not capture my child's attention either but this one is the worst. A mother who sneaks into her kid's room to recite her desperate litany/ then again as he is a teen/ again when he is living on his own and then he comes to her as she dies and then starts the cycle over with his child - almost sounds charming - but isn't. I think it is the ladder that gets me.
0985114606|5.0|I'm not going to review this story like everyone else - it's already been done.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I would strongly recomnd this to anyone who likes wave style games.  very good one and nice graphics. good game.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Great mystery and thriller. It makes you want to read more. Once again John Grisham puts another fabulous book for teens.
0984158421|5.0|this book is as close as you can get to the german tongue of that time (1920,s german tongue)..ford has taken into account that you must not tamper with history.....this book is scary...wow!..the controversy book is great, go read that book as well.. i can go on all day about this book..great translation by the way....go read it for your self....if you dare....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Suzanne Collins has created another great series like Harry Potter and Theodore Boone for teens.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent treatise on how the wheat in our diet has changed over the last fifty years. The rise in Celiac and other gluten induced disorders may (repeat, MAY) be due in part to better diagnostic capabilities, but what Dr. Davis discloses about new strains of grain makes one think that more is afoot. Also makes one pause to consider what other foodstuffs may have been affected nutritionally by modern agricultural methods.
1439102813|4.0|I read this book because I truly enjoyed Lisa Genova's other book [[ASIN:B005UVRE44 Left Neglected]].  Unfortunately, I can't say I enjoyed Still Alice.  Still Alice reminds me of my Lurlene Mcdaniel phase in middle school:  books about living with various diseases/disfunctions that always make you cry at some point.  This book is touching and emotional, but for me it is too sad and heartwrenching to recommend unless you have a specific interest in Alzeimers or want to have a good, long cry.  At this phase in my life, I'm not interested in spending my time crying through a book.
0345803485|1.0|Dreadful- nothing to waste your eyes or time on-it's so bad it can't even be considered trashy, in the good sense-this is just fit for the recycle bin. Poorly written,sex scenes fit for a teenaged fantasy, stupid plot, really rotten.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The artwork is lovely, elegant and soothing. The only thing that cost it a star is that $4.99 is way too expensive for an android  game. I got it free, would have paid MAYBE $1.99. I imagine down the line I may buy more games if they are not overpriced.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The second half of the book moves quickly.  I had trouble remembering who was who in the beginning.  This was our bookclub selection.  It did lead to a good discussion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The definition of a good book: One that makes you read until you're nearly blind, one that makes you resent real life interfering when you would rather be reading, one that stays in your mind when you aren't reading it.  These things happen with the Fifty Shades books. The books may have needed some better editing but the success of the Fifty Shades trilogy is their ability to hold a readers interest. The author makes you care about the characters and want to know what's going to happen next. I've started many a \\"good\\" book and put it down without finishing the first chapter because I just didn't care about the characters or plot.  Fifty Shades delivers plot, characters and the involvement of the readers in the progression of the story.  That's why the books are a success. I can't wait to start Fifty Shades of Freed.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Beat 1.6 without hints! It's an elephant . Pretty neat concept. If you use deductive reasoning you can quickly learn that this can not be that because that. also with large numbers...subtract the number say 12 from 15, then from the center draw as many black as possible leaving 3 on each side, then continue the puzzle.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I have been using this monitor for a few weeks now with my new baby and am really satisfied.  I know there are other ways to get this done with setting up IP cameras and making security cameras work for this purpose, but for overall design I don't think there is any comparison.  The recent app update has been working very well for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1-Hardware is nicely designed and the build quality seems very good.<br />2-If you have multiple iOS devices this is a great product.  Love how we can have multiple monitors going at once.<br />3-Nice \\"hidden\\" features like it works as a traditional audio only monitor if you close the unit and the app can be configured to play the audio in the background when the app is exited.<br />4-Can configure to use 2 wifi networks and will default back to bluetooth if off your network (bluetooth range is very limited).<br />5-Had issues at first with push notifications not working after recent app update.  Emailed support and received a response in less than one day and they acknowledged there was an issue on their side that would be corrected in about a day (and it was).<br />6-Really like the fifteen minute visual graph of motion and noise.  Temp and humidity are helpful.<br />7-Great nightlight.<br />8-Nightvision has been working pretty well with one exception.<br />9-Off network connection is seamless.<br />10- Configurable notifications.<br />11- My wife knows how to use it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1-The battery is really not that useful as it is reported it will only work for 1 hour with video and 2 with audio.  Really just useful to move the unit from one area to the next.<br />2- It is expensive, but not the most expensive option.  There are many video monitors that do less but cost more.<br />3- The music options are pretty limited, but the last app update listed that support was being built in for more options.<br />4- No website connectivity, only can be viewed over iOS devices.<br />5- Off network viewing limited to 15 minutes per day (reported you can buy more time but not yet available).<br />6- Their account services web site is not really ready for use and it is confusing what it will even be for.<br />7- Little odd details with the app like it is not very clear with the custom notifications for motion and noise as to which way the slider makes the sensor more or less sensitive.<br />8- I have noticed that in some light levels the camera seems to get confused and flips back and forth from night to day vision.<br /><br />Overall very happy and would not hesitate to fully recommend this device.  Most importantly the app and push notifications have been very reliable (after recent bug update).  I was initially concerned that I would miss my baby crying or moving.<br /><br />7- There is a slight delay with video and audio (0.5 to 1 second maybe).to 15 minutes per day (reported you can buy more time but not yet available).<br />6- Their account services web site is not really ready for use and it is confusing what it will even be for.<br />7- Little odd details with the app like it is not very clear with the custom notifications for motion and noise as to which way the slider makes the sensor more or less sensitive.<br />8- I have noticed that in some light levels the camera seems to get confused and flips back and forth from night to day vision.<br /><br />Overall very happy and would not hesitate to fully recommend this device.

B0083GPDBO|2.0|Not sure how this made it into the theaters. May possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen.<br />I guess an 8 year old might enjoy it. Glad I got it from the library, can't imagine spending money on<br />something like this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put any of the books down.  Got it as a sample on my kindle and ordered the Trilogy before I even finished the sample.  The whole world has gone nuts over these books - I saw the author interviewed on the view!!!  Also, for Erotica the characters are so strong you feel like you know them.  I cannot believe they pulled it from Library shelves when other books of this sort are there and poorly written.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I spend a few hours Aday playing this game its fun but its hard to find friends to visit. but I have fun with it.
1439102813|5.0|I love the author's both books. They are both amazing and inspiring stories. They make you to rethink what truely matters to your life. When you can't control your body, what would you do?<br /><br />Book Still Alice is a really sad book to me. It brought me to tears to read Alice can't choose the way to end her life with dignity. I don't know what I would do if I am helpless and hopeless like Alice.<br /><br />Life is short. Cherish every moment now. I am grateful what I have today. Thanks to the author.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Product arived in just a few days, in good shape, and it was nice to go looking,...With Out looking for a Parking Spot.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|As others have noted this is a very fun thinking game but the controls are not well designed. it is too easy to accidentally change an adjacent square and you may not know that you have done so making it hard to finish the puzzle. there are obvious fixes for this. they could have made the last squares that changed a different color so you can see what you did. they could have made squares lock after you change them so they can't be changed again by accident (with a button or something to unlock). abut of design work would make this a great game.
B001Q5395Q|4.0|I never liked clowns, so this film feeds well on how I view them. Ha! They creep me out. I don't like them. The film, on the other hand, is moderately hilarious most of the time.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Although there was a blemish line on the front of the product it was very minor and I'm very satisfied.
B007F1BQMS|4.0|I had super low expectations about this film. Super low. But I found that it was fun to watch! We had a special screening at the library and it's a super safe choice. Too many actors, but a delight to see them. I would buy this film. A great pick-me-up. One word of caution: Cheesy.<br />I liked Zac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer's segment the most.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|well 2nd time I have done this and still like the game. some how I lost all my games info and had to start over so this is lovly oh well buy the game its fun. and if ya have kids they well love it to
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I brought this book at first to see what all the fuss is about - talks with it picked up and being made into a movie<br />and with entertainment shows telling me how hot the book was i decided to see it for myself, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />firstly I just wanted to express how beautifully i thought the book was written, I was worried because sometimes these \\"best selling\\" books are suppose to be awesome but fall flat and your left scratching your head thinking \\"how did this make the list\\"<br /><br />i really liked Ana, I don't understand why some people didn't like her in any of the books.<br />i thought she was incredibly strong for even considering the \\"agreement\\" when i am sure most women would turn and go \\"oh hell no!\\"<br /><br />Christian is so freakin yummy, sexy, hot, smokin, beautiful, gorgeous anything along those lines and this is only a fictional character people!! Imagine who they are going to cast for this role (wipes drool away from cheek)<br />in my mind I could totally envision everything about him<br />from his bed-sex hair, his beautiful grey eyes right down to \\"the way his pants hung on his hips\\" as Ana puts it.<br /><br />i very much enjoyed this novel so much so i brought the second before i finished the first one so i didnt have to waste time waiting for it to download on to my kindle (yes it takes like 5 seconds to download on the kindle - 5 seconds too long)<br />definitely deserves 5 stars +++++ more
B007SGM084|3.0|Was ready to down load Fifty Shades of Gray Trilogy to my Kindle but decided I will skip it as they are too expensive. Wanted to read them so I could discuss them with my daughter who is reading them.this summer........ New books too expensive to order on the Kindle. Guess I will use it for the free books only. Publishers need to get out of the E-book business. I did end up buying the books at Costco and was skeptic about their content, but a female customer was in the area raving to anyone who would listen about how great the books were. After reading them I agree. They were good. They still ended up costing around 28.00 for the paper backs. But ultimately worth it. I'd di fine some of the writing a little immature considering the content.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|This was the first time I ever read a novel by Richard Castle. I found it to be mediocre, I didn't know what to expect but I did want it to be a page turner. Toward the end of the book, 3/4 it began to get interesting. However, I don't think I will purchase any other titles by this author.
B00004ZDVQ|4.0|this is a good cd. but what do you expect from stevie wonder. the disc was in good condition but it did seem like it took forever to get it. other than that its a great purchase.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game if you enjoy games like sudoku. Can be frustratingly pleasing. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah words
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been looking for a game like this on my KF for a long time now, and I'm so glad I checked the FAotD! This game is amazing. These kinds of puzzles have been my favorite for a long time now, but I always have to do them with paper/pencil since I can never find an electronic version. This game has good controls, and runs very smoothly. The zoom function is a nice addition, since the individual cells can get pretty tough to tap when the puzzles get larger and larger. This has a good number of puzzles, but I hope the dev continues to add more in future updates, because I know I'll be cruising through these in a week or two.
B007L96VCY|5.0|The Paul McCartney Archive Collection has made a fourth entry in their collection of remasters with McCartney's (as well as Linda McCartney's) 1971 classic, Ram. Once again, it confuses me as to why MPL and the rest decided to release the remaster now as opposed to last year, which marked 40 years since Ram was release. Still, this remaster/reissue of Ram follows the remaster/reissues of last year's McCartney and McCartney II. With Ram being my favorite album by Paul, I've heard it plenty of times. So I can safely say that MPL has done it again: the remastering is very good and the bonus disc compliments the original album perfectly.<br /><br />What else can I say about Ram? It's my favorite album from Paul McCartney and one of my all time favorite albums. All of the songs on the album are amazing. You've got \\"Too Many People\\", which is supposedly about McCartney's former band mate John Lennon. \\"Dear Boy\\" sounds like a lost outtake from The White Album while \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" is my personal favorite song off the album as it is just flat out bizarre. As for hits, you've got novelty-like ditty \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\", the autobiographical \\"Heart of the Country\\", and the epic closer \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\".<br /><br />As for the remastering, it's actually very good. This is a good thing because most remasters of classic albums (as well as new albums) are often too loud and are a victim of the so-called \\"loudness war\\". What's wrong with it being louder, you ask? Sometimes the sound can be so loud that some of the instruments are so distorted that they disappear from the mix altogether. Luckily, this isn't the case with these McCartney remasters or even the 2009 Beatles remasters and the 2010 Apple Record remasters. Until now, I have been listening to a 1987 CD issue of Ram. This new remaster is an improvement: I can hear things that were buried in the 1987 mix. Examples: I never noticed that there was another vocal track accompanying Paul on the first \\"Ram On\\" and there are a few things that Paul says at the end of \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" that were barely audible in the 1987 mix.<br /><br />The second disc consists of eight tracks, clocking in at 33 minutes. I'm not sure if they could have squeezed the eight tracks with the original album but this doesn't matter: the material on the second disc is actually very good. You get \\"Another Day\\", which was a hit single for McCartney, along with its rocker B-side \\"Oh Woman, Oh Why\\". For some reason, they put \\"Little Woman Love\\" on here. \\"Little Woman Love\\" was the B-Side to Wings' rendition of \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\". The next five tracks are a real treat for die-hard fans: they are all previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for Ram. The first of them (and personally, my favorite) is \\"A Love For You\\". It's a really great pop track that could have easily been a hit single. From what I see, the song has appeared on a few bootlegs and a version of it ended up on the soundtrack from the 2003 film The In-Laws. \\"Hey Diddle\\" is also on here as is the blues instrumental \\"Great Cock and Seagull Race\\". \\"Rode All Night\\" is a great eight minute (!) rocker while \\"Sunshine Sometime\\" is a nice easy-listening song.<br /><br />I'm pleasantly surprised by how good this remaster/reissue is. It doesn't matter if you already own a older copy of Ram: this is totally worth getting. They really did a great job at remastering a classic album and the bonus disc is bad at all. If you're a McCartney fan, you should not be disappointed.m On\\" and there are a few things that Paul says at the end of \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" that were barely audible in the 1987 mix.<br /><br />The second disc consists of eight tracks, clocking in at 33 minutes.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I never heard of the Black Keys before this year (I know! Living under a rock, I suppose) when I read about the band while reading an article online. On that recommendation, I went and bought the Brothers album (without even listening or sampling any of the tracks beforehand), just 'cause I felt like my music collection needed some much-welcomed addition from other artists, especially since I have been neglecting it in favor of expanding my movie library.<br /><br />To my utmost and immense surprise, I, immediately, was ridiculously so into almost all the tracks that the album has been in constant rotation since the day I received it in the mail. I especially love \\"Howlin' for You\\", \\"Tighten Up\\", and \\"Everlasting Light\\". Definite favorite and am now a bona fide fan of the band's music!
B0000024JN|5.0|I have been a casual fan of the Beastie Boys for a long time, and when I heard about Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch's passing, I decided to re-listen to all of their albums. Licensed To Ill is almost definitely my favorite (I say almost because everything they did is awesome, so it's hard to choose). Anyway, the first time I heard Licensed to Ill, I honestly thought it must have been a greatest hits album, except that it doesn't have \\"Sabotage\\" on it. My personal favorite tracks are \\"The New Style\\", \\"Slow and Low\\", \\"Paul Revere\\", and \\"Posse in Effect\\". If you are an old fan, I'm sure you already know and love it, and if you are a new fan, I would like to recommend immediate purchase and excessive play of this album. And then either \\"Check Your Head\\" or \\"Paul's Boutique\\" (or both!) need to be the next thing on your list. RIP MCA, you are missed.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love this album so much. I keep listening to each track again and again and again-unstoppable. His voice is so amazing. the musics overall are superb. It is a must buy album.
B007UXSPK2|1.0|This review contains spoilers, though they ain't spoiling much.<br /><br />The script was just terrible, if you wanna make a decent movie you have to ask yourself some questions. Is this what would really happen? Is that what this character would do? Is this really what this person would say? These guys just didn't do that. Like at the end of the movie when the bad guy throws himself off the building, brief case in hand, to stop Ethan from getting the case. Couldn't he just have thrown the case? Would a person really launch themselves off along with it, just for dramatic effect? Or if the government had some super secret agency as a last line of defense against nuclear terrorism and biological warfare, would the missions really be optional? I can just imagine the director trying to organize operations. \\"Oh no? you don't feel like accepting the mission to stop the nuclear bomb from detonating, OK, I'll see if Johnson wants to do it.\\" And don't even get me started on the dialog, when Ving Rhames has to make a cameo just to tell you how corny blurting out \\"Mission Accomplished\\" at the climax of the movie is, that's when you know you got problems.<br /><br />And it wasn't just that the character's were unrealistic, the whole plot hinged on coincidence after coincidence. \\"Oh my god! The terrorists just made off with the nuclear codes, what are we gonna do!?\\" \\"Don't worry, I happen to know a guy, who knows a guy, who knows where they're going.\\" Or when Ethan's in the car with the defense secretary and out of nowhere Russian law enforcement unloads on their vehicle with assault rifles. How did they even know where Ethan was, or who was in the car? Or were they just out blasting random vehicles? Maybe things are a little different in Russia, but in North America generally they throw on the blinkers and tell you to pull over first.<br /><br />Why is it that every time you're on a mission to save the world from nuclear disaster, every piece of equipment you brought breaks, and then a sandstorm rolls in.<br /><br />The only mission impossible here was the actors trying to make this thing believable.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|OMG!! This series is a great read! I have stayed up late many of nights for not being able to put this book down. There are many many characters and a lot of twists and turns. Truly, this is a page turner!<br />Having found out that this is a show on HBO makes it all that much more exciting. When I am finished reading this series I will definately watch it as well!

But ever since I was a teenager I could not wrap my mind around why people are so good at sabotaging themselves and making such bad choices. I spent years in college taking every psychology course I could, trying to understand fellow humans, and this book is a must read for those in search of understanding human behaviour a bit better. I wish this book would have been around years ago.<br /><br />It's actually a book I recommend buying, which is what I came on Amazon to do. I rented it from the library and read through fairly quickly. I can't wait to reread and actually take the time to work though the book and implement the suggestions given.

B006PKV2QU|5.0|This book is fun, interesting, humorous, motivating and snarky. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I'm often disappointed by children's books because the reviews are not at all like the actual book. But in this case you're safe. It's a great read and your kids will love it.

B004UQ03P2|5.0|I am 100% satisfied with this screen cover. Not only does it help drastically with the glare but it is giving me piece of mind knowing my screen is protected. With two young kids at home they are always looking at the computer and sometimes touching the screen and I used to cringe when they do. Now with this cover I know that my original screen is protected and to clean this cover is simply a breeze! I think it is worth every penny!

B0031Y9DCS|5.0|As a fellow helicopter pilot in Vietnam, I must agree with the 5-star reviews.  The author has a knack for telling it like it was.  The voice is unique and reflects the crude, raw viciousness of the war, but also tempers it with humor and compassion.  My hat is off the Mr. Mason.
1469984202|5.0|Thought this was a great sci-fi read. I am normally not a huge sci-fi reader, but I have read many of the classics, and I thought this one ranked right up there with 1984, Brave New World, Ender's Game, etc. It is very engaging, although the beginning moves a bit slowly. Once you get into the first couple of chapters, I guarantee you will be hooked. Howey always makes you think you know where he is going with this story, but I bet it will surprise you!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I don't typically read erotica but this book really hit the spot. I don't think its your run of the mill erotica book with fabio on the cover. It is written for women of this day and age. I can't put it down can't wait to read the next one

B007L96VCY|5.0|Now this is one remaster I've been waiting for a long time! I feel for some reason a lot of people outside of hardcore Beatle/McCartney fans really neglect this particular album. That might have something to do with the fact his debut [[ASIN:B004WJRF6C McCartney]] came out so soon after the breakup of the Beatles. In all honesty  it would be all to easy to assume people passed over this due to his filing a lawsuit that in effect broke up the Bealtes. Not to mention the public fued with John Lennon,which is more than evident in the lyrics if one pays attention to the implicit meanings. Basically however this represents an important period in McCartney's life. He had just gone through a long period of depression following the demise of the Beatles. And he was now settling into their Scottish home with step daughter Heather and baby daughter Mary. Things had even became tranquil enough where Paul went to New York with Linda and musicians Denny Seiwell (future founding Wings member),David Spinozza and Hugh McCracken to record this album. Aside from it's one hit not sure if it faired commercially too well. But musically it's one of (if not my favorite) Paul McCartney solo albums ever. One thing that's so wonderful about it is how much of that Beatles era strength of songcraft is still present in McCartney's sound. He's so fresh from working with George Martin that he was very deep into understanding the value of great pop production too.<br /><br />  \\"Too Many People\\" and \\"Dear Boy\\" have some of McCartney's most outstanding melodies blended with the some of the most dramatic and creative uses of he and Linda's multi tracked and abstractly echoed vocal harmonies. On the almost Lennon/Phil Spector like \\"3 Legs\\" and the heavy guitar rock of \\"Smile Away\\" Paul is singing the blues,always with that quirky sentimentality he seems to get all the time.  But he is genuinely positive minded too. \\"Ram On\\" is one of the most beautiful and haunting melodies he's ever come up with,musically almost a dreamy blend of gypsy guitar,soulful electric piano and Brian Wilson type wall of sound. Honestly haven't heard many pop songs quite like that.  \\"Uncle Albert\\" was the hit here and is another one of those internal medley type songs that extends to a big degree from the Abbey Road era. And much the same as with the pean to rural existence in \\"Heart Of The Country\\" and the epic \\"Long Haired Lady\\" still have that late period Beatle sound,with horns and vocal harmonies on full cylinder. \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" and \\"Eat At Home\\" are two of his most intricately constructed pop/rockers here-again domesticity seems to be the theme. The album closes with the richly written ballad \\"The Back Seat Of My Car\\",one of those little dating tale story songs McCartney has proven himself so wonderful with over the years.<br /><br />  On this particular remaster there's also a bonus disk available. It contains \\"Another Day\\" or course,a hit single recorded during these sessions as well as the two other singles from this period in the sprightly rockers \\"Oh Woman,Oh Why\\" and \\"Little Woman Love\\". The songs \\"A Love For You\\" and the almost childrens folky blues of \\"Hey Diddle\\" are songs I only heard in rough form on a rare outtakes collection called Cold Cuts. \\"Great Cokc And The Seagull Race\\" is a very intricately textured pop song that's very short but easily grabs your attention. \\"Rode All Night\\" is a very spastic,intense eight minute plus rocker that is very atonal for a Paul McCartney song and a very big surprise here. This bonus disk concludes with the wonderfully textured,highly melodic instrumental pop of \\"Sunshine Sometime\\". The re master of everything,especially the original album is superb. McCartney himself supervised the reissue and rather than take the too easy reissue approach of running with the \\"loudness wars\\" pack and just turning the sound up. The mixes have been tweaked from the masters so the instrumentation has more obvious definition and had a less flatsound to it than the original CD. It's a change even I,very much a non audiophile notice. An excellent way to introduce yourself to one of the finest solo album a Beatle ever made.sound to it than the original CD. It's a change even I,very much a non audiophile notice. An excellent way to introduce yourself to one of the finest solo album a Beatle ever made.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I always have to chuckle at the slower minded people who can't figure out how to read. If they would only open their eyes, they wouldn't leave bad reviews. It's. too bad because this is a pretty good game. The ads are a bit over the top, but most of the games are fairly easy. A couple of the games have difficult controls and are slightly frustrating. Overall, a good time waster.

B0062HS03O|5.0|You don't have to be a Lady Gaga fan to appreciate the quality of this blu ray DVD program.  First -- the people at HBO did a great job in editing the material -- the performance moves - it is dynamic, with great sound and color.  Their use of black and white for the interspersed black stage scenes was clever.  I have never really listened to Lady Gaga before this DVD.  Some of her music seems very good and her staging was great.  My only complaint is that this blu ray disk does not support \\"resume play\\".  Thus if you put the disk on stop or want to watch the program over several nights it will start over from the beginning -- this is a very irritating feature of many blu ray disks.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|If you are looking for another zany Jim Carrey comedy this isn't the movie for you. Carrey has his moments of goofiness, but the most intriguing part of the movie is the basic concept. Carrey plays a man who's whole life has been built around him. He is the star of a TV show that has documented every second of his life, and he has no idea about it. The movie does a great job of showcasing how much the director of the show and the audience have grown to care for Truman. The movie is heartfelt and funny. An all around great movie.
0385534639|5.0|Absolutely amazing book.  There are a few places where it does start to get a little \\"long\\" feeling, but those don't last long, and suddenly you're right back to tearing through the pages as fast as you can devour them.<br /><br />Beautiful, seductive prose.  The best of Cirque du Soleil with an added dose of REAL magic!  I so wish I could attend the Night Circus...
B006Z2WE0G|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  As a matter of fact I did recommend it to my daughter's book club and I bought copies for everyone.  This book, even though it is fiction, brings a part of history to light.  I felt the tragedy and pain that Sarah experienced; from tucking her brother \\"safely\\" into the closet, to her horror as she was separated from her mother.  I was swept up in every word.  This book is thought provoking and haunting.

0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkins is very intelligent and his book is well organized, however the information in this book made me believe in God more. So really his words had the opposite effect from those intended. The more he talked about irreducibly complex creations and the fact that the earth is perfectly located for life, the more I thought how amazing God really is. He just seemed to keep presenting facts that made me in awe of creation. Dawkins makes many statements like: \\"living things are not designed.\\" This is so obviously not true. All it takes is a quick glance at nature to know there was a designer.<br /><br />Reading this book was like watching the news. It is filled with bad news. Most Christians could probably agree that people can be evil even if they claim to be religious. There are power hungry individuals who will use religion to get what they want. This is an accepted fact. In this book you will find no instances of where religion made individuals better people. Richard Dawkins seems to feel that religious people are \\"unsophisticated\\" and that people who follow Darwin's ideas have had their \\"consciousness raised.\\"<br /><br />Richard Dawkins even has negative things to say about the late Mother Teresa. I was shocked by that until I realized he was really reacting to her stance against abortion! Richard Dawkins ideas about abortion (he seems unsympathetic about the pain a child feels when cut out of the womb) and child abuse (Is teaching religion worse than physical abuse?) were also a little shocking. He is obviously frustrated with anyone teaching their child about religion. I have to ask this: Is it not more abusive not to tell a child how to get to heaven and to then let them go to hell for all eternity? Only you can decide that but I have an opinion about it.<br /><br />To be honest this book just isn't very comforting. Dawkins believes that immortality is wishful thinking. He literally rips away hope from your heart. Religion gives hope and comfort to many people. I think it does more good than harm especially in regards to the fear of death. Hasn't Dawkins read any books on near-death experiences? If he has he doesn't mention them in this book.<br /><br />If you have not read the entire Bible and you read this book first you may be shocked by some of the stories in the Old Testament. If the Old Testament troubles you I'd recommend you read: [[ASIN:0801072751 Is God a Moral Monster?: Making Sense of the Old Testament God]]<br /><br />In the end, I'd have to say that I believe Blaise Pascal's Wager is more in my line of thinking. I believe that if you don't believe in God it is more dangerous than believing in God. Believing in God is harmless while not believing could result in your soul spending eternity without God. To be honest I think it takes an immense amount of faith to believe God doesn't exist - perhaps more faith than believing in God in the first place.<br /><br />And now for anyone who doubts God is real I have this story to tell. It might seem a little strange and at first I was sort of amazed by it myself. I have something that happens to me that is very rare. I hear and see words at the same time and when I write them down they make messages. So like if I was reading a book and saw the word \\"believe\\" I would hear it at the same time in music. While reading this book I was listening to a CD I had made from songs I liked. Somehow the lyrics in the songs lined up with the words in Dawkins' book. The message I received was:<br /><br />Know<br />Believe<br />There<br />Is<br />God<br />One<br />Me<br /><br />I know Richard Dawkins is not going to like this but it seems God spoke directly to me while reading this book for the first time. God does like saying hello! :) The second time I read it while listening to the same CD the word \\"believe\\" kept appearing. God obviously wanted me to believe in Him despite what Dawkins said. Thank you Dawkins for confirming my faith. Your book has made me believe in God evenmore.<br /><br />Some other books I have enjoyed include:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PKE5YK A Scientist's God]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004HKIIEO Encountering Heaven and the Afterlife]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005D38S0I Richard Dawkins and His God Delusion: A Preliminary Critique of His Truth Claims]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:083081891X Written on the Heart: The Case for Natural Law]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FC2KEC The Case for a Creator: A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God (Strobel, Lee)]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewmore.<br /><br />Some other books I have enjoyed include:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PKE5YK A Scientist's God]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004HKIIEO Encountering Heaven and the Afterlife]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005D38S0I Richard Dawkins and His God Delusion: A Preliminary Critique of His Truth Claims]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:083081891X Written on the Heart: The Case for Natural Law]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FC2KEC The Case for a Creator: A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God (Strobel, Lee)]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its a fun game but a lot of the time you are waiting for your energy to come back to continue your quest. Other than that its really fun.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|It's been a long time since a book moved me and this one for some reason did. I read it in a day. Lots of parts I liked, lots of parts I didn't. But the good totally outweighed the bad. While it's a college-aged love story, it is written for adults. There's not so much sex as there is violence and violent behavior, and severe underage binge drinking.<br /><br />I've edited this review to say I've read this book more than once now, and while I have more sympathy toward Travis than Abby, all the characters I found likable and believable in the story. For those that are tired of watching the guy finally telling the girl how he feels in the last chapter, in this book Travis knows what he wants and it takes the whole book for Abby to figure out what she wants.<br /><br />For those who are sensitive toward violence, the main characters are familiar and comfortable with street and underground fighting, so expect blood and fights throughout the story. This story is pretty raw, but so unlike other fluff romance books. The characters have real feelings and react sometimes in the wrong ways. But I found it to be a page turner.
B007P6VM04|4.0|I agree with all the posts here about the choices on this soundtrack, so many people say you can get more tracks at 'Target' (although not SHWBG grrr), which we don't have in the UK...Is there any store in the UK that offers this?

B004JN1D2I|4.0|This is a great escapist fantasy novel.  Martin weaves several plot lines that ar each very interseting, and leaves the reader hanging at the end of each chapter, which makes for a somewhat addictive reading experience.  The characters are easy to identify with and very human.  The story draws from many real world histories, including The Anarchy following the reign of Henry I of England, the Celtic, Anglo-Saxan, and Norman settling/conquests of the British isles.<br /><br />There are a few puzzling aspects to the fantasy world Martin creates and leaves little detail for. Like, how could any large society feed itself through a winter that lasts several years, why are there long winters in the first place (is the planet axis on a crazy wobble?), and how does everyone know stories and histories going back 8 thousand of years.  No real-world society, even Egypt, I would suspect, ever had a firm grasp of the stories of kings, heroes, and famous events going back that farm.<br /><br />Overall, a great story and sure to keep you company for a long time once you pick it up.

0345803485|4.0|If you are looking for a mental workout, this book is not for you. You should read \\"War and Peace\\" or something else. This book is about losing yourself in the pure entertainment value and that is exactly what I did. I don't read books to critique them, I read them to let my mind wonder into another reality where I don't have dishes to wash or laundry to fold. If this is how you immerse yourself in books, have at it! Pure entertainment, pure fun, pure debauchery. The first book focuses more on the relationship and does not get into the BDSM that everyone else makes it seem like it is focused on.<br /><br />I would read it again...just for the fun of it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely loved it and thrilled that I have it on my Kindle so I can re-read at my leisure. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a spell-binding, cannot put down type of book!
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a very good, efficient exercise program.  You get a very effective workout in a short period of time.  Jillian also stresses proper warmup , form, and cool-down and I am surprised at how little I hurt, even though I was not in good shape to start with and the exercises were hard.  It is great that there are two examples to watch (one doing everything 'full throttle' while another girl does a lower-impact version while Jillian explains things.<br /><br />the format of the DVD itself does not lend itself well to a daily exercise program.  You have to wait through a long start-up (can't fast forward through it), then some ads (you can fast-forward through them), then Jillian explaining things (again, no fast-forward), then you get to pick your workout for that day (more explanations which you only need the first time, but you can fast forward through those).  So, for a 20-minute program you have to wait at least 5 minutes each day to get the thing started; tough when you are in a hurry.  I prefer exercise DVD's to start right up with menu options that let you go straight to the workout.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Ten years passed between Soldier of Love and its predecessor, but Sade and her band pick up exactly where they left off, erasing time as the haunting \\"Moon and the Sky\\" opens the record. Sade experiments with the occasional new sound and revisits classic themes, but the outcome is always fresh. A mournful cello intensifies \\"Morning Bird,\\" a poetic eulogy, while the soft reggae of Lovers Rock resurfaces on \\"Babyfather.\\" With its love-gone-wrong lyrics, \\"Skin\\" plays like an update on \\"Bullet Proof Soul\\" with a greater emphasis on resolve and inner-strength. The rhythmic title track is almost cinematic. It sounds like no Sade song before it but fits comfortably into their catalog. Soldier of Love is an exhibition of a band's longevity, and it is a gift to Sade's longtime fans.

B005FISC52|5.0|I just finished watching the ninth and final season of One Tree Hill with my family last night.<br />I am so glad we, the audience, as well as the characters, all got the ending we deserved. There are genuine tears and genuine laughs, and although the show has always had something missing since Lucas and Peyton left, the final season does have several nods in acknowledgement of the emptiness they've left behind, including - Minor Spoiler - a visit from Chad Michael Murray himself in one of the episodes.<br /><br />The season is in NO WAY a 'We're settling down, life is gonna be good and easy, it's a happy ending' kind of thing. The show uses its final season as a way to go all out and give us a maximum of drama, and remind us of how much we love the characters. The amount of small things that have carried out through the series that make appearances, and surprises that make you jump, proud to remember something related to, or dating back to the first few seasons - and the series as a whole - are very generous, and very heart-warming.<br /><br />Even if you have stopped watching the TV show, you need to watch the final season. Do it for Haley, Nathan and Brooke AT LEAST. AT LEAST. You definitely will not regret it.<br /><br />I generally hate reviews and I know this one does absolutely NO justice... but I'll keep it short. Purchase this season. I cannot recommend it enough. I thank God for One Tree Hill. These characters have been there for me during the worst of times, and even my college essay was about the show. It's simply a magical television series.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION: In this spectacular final season the acting is top notch, the stories are involving, and the thirteen episodes truly invest and tightly grip the heart of the viewer, in full command of all emotions. Prepare the kleenex and prepare to enjoy yourself on one last adventure with our old friends.<br /><br />Goodnight, (One) Tree Hill.

B0084YCKMU|5.0|The cliffhanger that this episode ends on couldn't be cliffier if we had actually seen Holmes and Watson going over the falls to their death. Instead we get that deliciously nasty little ponce, Moriarty, causing trouble and wreaking the ultimate havoc in the lives of Holmes and Watson. Moriarty isn't out to steal anything, though Mycroft claims that he already has computer code that will grant him access to anything in the world, Moriarty is out to ruin and kill Holmes, the only entertainment left to him.<br /><br />He does this by discrediting Holmes and the fall is far and dark indeed as it always is when it begins at the pinnacle. Holmes is shown as a narcissistic neurotic who faked all of his cases, at times even commiting the crimes for public adulation. How will Holmes escape the trap and will it be as ingenious as the original? Will Watson forgive him the ruse or will he be so glad to see him that he won't care? Watson's poignancy at Holmes's grave is very moving.<br /><br />We won't know until next season. The writing in the episode is fluent and fast-paced and the acting is as always superb. I have enjoyed this update of Holmes and will definitely tune in for the Season 3 when PBS airs them. As all episodes stand on their own, there is no need to see Season 1 before viewing Season 2 except for the utter enjoyment of watching all episodes of this update of a classic. Recommended not only to fans of the original Doyle stories and novels but to fans of the PBS Mystery series and mysteries in general. No untoward sex or violence in this episode.

B00834PFC8|4.0|Writing an update for the classic Hound of the Baskervilles is daunting and I wouldn't have wanted to be the writer who had to take on that task. The original hound involved vengeance for a rape on the moors some years back. This new hound involves government experimentation in genetics and mind-altering substances, hotel owners, Moriarty and everything but the kitchen sink. Set in the far north of England, as was the original, Watson and Holmes have to travel at the request of a young man haunted and traumatized by the death of his father at the jaws of the harrowing hound. Others have seen this hound on the moors as well, though no one has yet caught it.<br /><br />I love the new Sherlock series as my reviews indicate, but I was disappointed in this update. The plot was convoluted and a bit overwrought and except for the name bore no resemblence to the original. Other Sherlock scripts have kept key elements of the original stories while updating them to the twenty-first century. I would have liked to have seen the update where the hound was vengeance for a rape and believe that this could have been done rather than the secret government installation that we got. I did like the update of Lord Baskerville, who isn't a lord in this iteration but found the overall plot a bit overdone. That said, watching this new version of Sherlock is still worth it and a weaker episode here is better than most other mystery and procedural shows. Recommended with a small caveat.<br /><br />Now that all episodes of Season 2 have aired I can recommend both seasons of Sherlock without reservation. Five of the six adaptations are thrilling and the one that falls short is so far above other offerings that it can be overlooked. I am awaiting Season 3 with pleasure and impatience.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|I have the 1992 version of the cd and it is what I prefer sound quality-wise. The new release is not bad - as a matter of fact, it's pretty good. I thought for sure it would be ruined like most \\"anniversary\\" cds are nowadays, but it wasn't. The DVD is a nice addition to any Pantera fan's library. While there are only 5 songs performed here, it's nice to have some new footage of these guys. For the collector and those who do not have this - I suggest you fork over the $ and get it. If the DVD isn't of any interest and you have the original cd then you should pass.
B008133JZG|5.0|The BBC update of the Conan Doyle stories has been cheeky and refreshing. The unsettling aspects of Sherlock's character that Doyle could only hint at are here brought to the fore as a combination autistic savant and schizoid type. It is brilliant and it works. Watson is a far smarter foil than he has ever before been allowed to be and the adaptations of the stories are for the most part inspired.<br /><br />Irene Adler is working for Moriarty, as in the stories, but here she is much more her own woman and is also a dominatrix. Is she the only woman that can turn Sherlock's head or has he turned hers? It speaks to the quality of the acting that the viewer is never quite sure. Irene Adler holds blackmail materials on everybody who is anybody in England, but she doesn't use them to blackmail, she uses them to insure her continued safety in the world. Until Moriarty wants one secret and Irene manipulates Holmes to get it. The plot is fast and fun and as long as sexual innuendo doesn't offend, pretty stunning stuff. Acting, writing and production values are all top notch and the London of the eye is so nicely photographed, along with Georgian townhouses, that the viewer doesn't miss the gaslight of Victoria's London as much as might be expected.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Holmes, BBC mysteries and mysteries in general. It is also recommended that the original stories be read - not to explain the current offering but for their own sake.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Extremely addictive! I seriously can't put it down, and when I'm not playing,I'm thinking of playing! Recommended for anyone who likes logic puzzles.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Spoiler alert: While I've left out the pivotal events in this film, the details I've included may seem like spoilers so read this one at your own risk. I'd certainly welcome feedback about whether I gave too much away in this review. You might want to read it after seeing the film and answer some of the questions brought up in this review.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that is not only highly controversial but likely to split viewers into the \\"love it\\" or \\"absolutely hate it\\" camp. Those who hate it are likely to find it beyond disturbing and actually loathsome.<br /><br />But  I was very eager to see this movie. If you've already viewed the film you might well wonder why.  The major reason was because I'd read the book on which this film is based and it haunted me.<br /><br />The movie is a very dark tale of one family and the way a difficult child can divide husband and wife as well as derail one mother's life. But is she to blame? I don't think so. Others may disagree. Instead, I think the film explores the age old question of nature versus nurture and how that affects moral development.<br /><br />From the outset, it is clear that Kevin and his mother, played by Tilda Swinton, seem to be at odds with each other. Why this is the case is less clear although some reviewers have felt that Kevin's mother is to blame for his chillingly cold heart.<br /><br />A crucial part of the movie resides in the last few sentences spoken by Kevin, shortly before the fiilm credits roll. If there is any hopeful note (and that is subject to interpretation) it is at that point in the movie.<br /><br />I wish I could write those words here but that would rob potential viewers of a riveting moment, what I consider the key to the theme of the movie. Listen to Kevin and you might even feel some sympathy for him, some sense of a person who may be as lost to himself as to his family.<br /><br />Not  all lives are sunny and there are not always pat endings as films like [[ASIN:B004AE3QYE Rabbit Hole]] and others which explore painful family events make clear. In Rabbit Hole, Nicole Kidman did a stellar job showing how one woman dealth with the loss of a child.<br /><br />In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Tilda Swinton mines the depths of pain just as Kidman did in Rabbit Hole - although the family dynamics are far different. Swinton shows a woman who starts out with hope, giddily falls in love, gets pregnant and then goes on to have a life far different than she could possibly imagine. It could happen to many of us. Perhaps that also adds to the difficulty in sitting through this film. It made me squirm uncomfortably in my chair but it also made me want to know more about the mother and son at the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Swinton's character forced me to face the fact that even as we deny the reality, the truth is that our lives can change drastically in one moment and that horrific moment can change our lives for years - if not for the rest of our lives. .<br /><br />The lives portrayed here seemed very real. I could imagine a family where one child remained a mystery. It is hard to see this one and not wonder if the conscience is formed even before birth or whether parents have much impact on that. In short, is it genes or environment that affects personality most - a question that has been asked for years.<br /><br />I was awestruck by the imagery and camera work in We Need to Talk About Kevin. Many scenes are stunners simply because of a particular angle and some of the close-ups seem like artistic works, often ominous but portraying shocking events without graphic detail (although there are exceptions). Some of the most violent events have to be reconstructed in the viewers' imaginations.<br /><br />For those who believe Kevin's mother is at the root of his problems consider these questions:<br /><br />1. Why is the mother able to conceive, bear and nurture  a loving daughter?<br /><br />2. Could a difficult pregnancy and uncomfortablefeelings actually be a foreboding of things to come or was there a true mismatch between mother and son? Or did mother turn against Kevin when her infant turned out to be exhausting and overwhelmed her? For that matter, did she ever turn against him or just grow disheartened as her attempts to reach him  seemed doomed.<br /><br />3. How and why are husband and wife so split in their feelings about Kevin? Are they both in denial or do they each have a truly different relationship with their son?<br /><br />4. Could anything have changed the outcome? Was there anything Kevin's mother could have done differently to change her son for the better? Or was the outcome fated almost from the day Kevin was born?feelings actually be a foreboding of things to come or was there a true mismatch between mother and son? Or did mother turn against Kevin when her infant turned out to be exhausting and overwhelmed her? For that matter, did she ever turn against him or just grow disheartened as her attempts to reach him  seemed doomed.<br /><br />3.

1439156816|5.0|So it's a good thing he is very entertaining. Actually I learned a lot about writing through his coming of age stories. On Writing reads like a private conversation with King. It's fast paced and packed with details of his life. There are sections that talk about technique and grammar but mostly it's a chance to see into the mind of the master. Love him or hate him, King's an icon whether you dig his style or not. He turned writing into rock stardom and paved the way for authors to become celebrities. Worth reading.
B0000252YK|1.0|Ultimate sin is an \\"Ultimate Sin\\".  \\"Shot in The dark\\"...classic.  The rest is a repetition of one song after another. I thought my cd player was acting up.  Spend a few more $$$ and get \\"Essential Ozzy Osborne\\".  Just my opinion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate. quick download. updates frequently to keep up with changes.  long term forecast also very accurate. would reccommend to anyone
B002EWD0I6|5.0|The Lark Rise to Candleford series is a wonder series for the whole family. It is about life in the late 1700's, early 1800's and is a little serious, a little comedic, and just entertaining. I highly recomment it for teens and adults especially.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Ok, I'm just now seeing Iron Man 2.  The reason is I recently saw Avengers and wasn't familiar with Scarlett Johansson's character as Natasha Romanoff.  My sister said \\"Oh she was introduced in Iron Man 2.\\" So I promptly got on Amazon and ordered it.  Now I've heard different reviews from friends about this movie such as: it's too loud, too much shooting and explosions, I've also heard that \\"it was just alright\\" --so naturally being an Iron Man fan I wanted to see Part 2.  In the beginning like another reviewer mentioned, I was kinda getting a bit annoyed with the whole quest for the Iron Man suit.  Then you went through a nervousness about Tony's erratic behavior because he thought he was dying due to the reactor in his chest (although I knew it wouldn't kill him because he was in Avengers) so then we move to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rouke's character) and I actually think he plays a great bad guy, so I liked his role in the movie.  Sam Rockwell, well, he's Sam Rockwell. The shooting, explosions wasn't too over the top for me so I don't agree with others about that point. .so I thought Iron Man 2 was pretty decent, but not as good as Iron Man.
B001KQKC0Q|4.0|You can never get tired of this album, its diverse and great. gets me ready for work on a bad day. nothing bothers me
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Bought this cover for my daughter's Kindle as a birthday gift and she loves it. The item arrived on time and exactly as pictured.
1589949811|4.0|So I haven't played many LCGs so far (the only other ones being Game of Thrones and Cthulhu), but this is by far the most difficult to understand and play. I think it probably took me three of four tries after going through the rulebook before I got everything down, and I'm still not even sure if I understand everything. I'm not sure if I'm just making it harder than it needs to be, or if the game really IS that difficult.<br /><br />Either way, this is easily my favorite LCG so far. I don't have many people I play games with, so Game of Thrones doesn't work well. Those I do play with prefer co-op games whenever possible, so Cthulhu isn't as popular (though I would say it is the best of the three I have played just based on the core set). So LoTR is really where it's at for me. It just takes a lot of trial and error to understand everything, and I'm still having a hard time doing a play-through where I make it through the first quest without losing. I think I may be in the minority though, since most people seem to enjoy this game a lot. Just do yourselves a favor if you purchase this and watch some guides online, because the rule book can be a little vague on certain things. Fantastic game though. One of the best co-op board/card games out there.
0062124293|4.0|This book is more of an entertaining memoir than a study of modern womanhood, which is ok in my book, it works! Caitlin Moran uses the backdrop of pivotal moments and issues in every woman's life to tell her story, from her entrance into womanhood to her musings on various female topics. While I won't list every  topic Moran discusses I found some of her topics particularly interesting.<br /><br />Moran's theory of the evolution of the popular way for a Woman to keep her...for lack of a better word...nether regions ...had me in tears..What's more, I believe her theory to be correct and I think women everywhere should rebel and go back to the way things used to be. Moran's description of her family life with her sisters was so endearing that I would love a second book on that subject alone.<br /><br />Her musings on women's weight issues were thought-provoking too, she brings a unique perspective to this issue that struck a cord with me...\\"overeating , says Moran, is the addiction of choice of carers, and that's why it's come to be regarded as the lowest - ranking of all the addictions.\\" I agree. Moran's thought here sits better to me than simply brushing off a woman's weight gain as \\"letting herself go.\\" Moran also discusses motherhood, marriage, and most courageously, abortion.  I found her telling of her personal experience one of the most honest, raw and intense that I have ever read.  She made me think on a subject that I had thought I'd closed the door on...it is a rare book that can do that!  From start to finish, How to Be a Woman is a worthwhile read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this is a great game. It is extremely addicting. It has a few glitches, but nothing is perfect right?
B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie I can watch over and over again...love it.I wanna cross over the wall.so cool.Would give it 10 stars if I could.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I agree with all the reviews saying what a great puzzle game this is. But I'm having the same problem on my Asus transformer as people mentioned on the kindle fire:  after closing the game, if I try to open it again later I get a blank screen. The only fix I have found is powering down and restarting. That's a total PITA. But other than that it's fun and really addictive!

B007BVOF8E|5.0|Having read the novel on which this movie is based the same week I viewed this movie, I was looking forward to seeing how the film would capture the tone and complexity of this spy thriller.  Was also anticipating seeing the dashing Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch.<br /><br />Loved the aesthetics of the film, the 1970's greige (gray + beige) color of the film, costumes and sets.  The one bold use of color I noted was in a brilliant baby blue necktie worn by Benedict when he went to steal a log of calls from an office. Watch for it; it's mezmerizing.<br /><br />The film lacked color in the way that aspects of the 70's lacked color and pace. So it accurately captured the colorless times and the standoff in the Cold War.  Gary Oldman plays an astute, plodding spy who is being cuckolded by a friend and fellow spy.  It gives him an air of impotence. Loved the chess pieces used to dramatize TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY with faces--great dramatic touch.<br /><br />The movie includes the relevant plot points in the book and brings them to life, albeit changing a few details. But it's accurate enough to satisfy most Le Carre purists.<br /><br />I loved the movie, having read the book.  Not sure how I'd feel if I hadn't read the book.  The book is slow-moving, cerebral, deep and slowly builds suspense.  So, does the movie.  My brother, who hadn't read the book who watched the movie with me, said it held his attention even though he didn't understand it.  Best movie he's ever seen that he couldn't follow, he said.  I couldn't follow his favorite movie INCEPTION, so am sympathetic.<br /><br />The movie is best appreciated after reading the book, and the book is best appreciated and understood after seeing the movie.  If you liked the book, you should love this movie.  Otherwise, it may be a toss-up....
B001U9BRNE|3.0|OK ... The video and audio quality of this BD is top notch and you'll not be disappointed in that arena.<br /><br />But the concert itself i found very nuaseating which is why i gave the overall 3-stars. David Foster kept on saying \\"I....I.....I\\", endlessly talking about his accomplishments ad-nauseum. I mean, it was as though he put on a concert to remind people how wonderful and brilliant he was at creating all the music hits of the 80s and 90s in all musical styles. It really felt like a eulogy that he was giving himself!!! This is what turned me off the whole concert. Your friends and colleagues are supposed to give you the praise and speak nice and wonderful things about you and what you've done for them in their lives. But if you put on a show and talk about yourself for more than 2 hours ... i mean it really became awful. So you've been warned!!!
B0073XORCY|4.0|Having seen Jethro Tull in the 70's,80's and 90's live and following them since \\"This Was\\",I feel I am qualified to give fair review. First up, to me this is a Tull album. I don't know about this JT's Ian Anderson business. Tull have always been changing musicians since M.Abrahams left after 1st album. Then theres Martin Barre not being on this album. Martin B. has always been one of my favorite guitarists OF ALL TIME. I feel the same way I did when Barrimore Barlow stopped drumming for Tull,also one of my favorite drummers OF ALL TIME. I also still miss John Evan on keys.Things change.With that being said,I was pleasantly supprised with this follow-up to TAAB. It is kinda interesting to here an update on old Gerald Bostock.The music on this album is as prog as ever and the playing is great. Ian has never surrounded himself with subpar players.The new guitarist even sounds a little like Martin B.sometimes.I will agree somewhat with another reviewer that Ian's voice is not as strong as it once was but who's is after \\"singing all day\\" for 40+ years. If I wanted to nit-pick,I would say I wish the album had been recorded louder,but thats nit-picking or maybe my hearing.No follow-up could recapture the magic of \\"Thick As A Brick\\",but this is a welcome addition to my Tull collection.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Just saw this movie on netflix out of curiousity. I kept hearing people say it wasn't good on t.v. and in person. I watched it out of curiousity to see how bad it was. It started out good and kept my attention to the very end. It was really cool and well done. Don't understand why so many people hated on it. Maybe they were dimwitted people who like fast and furious movies, flashy fast cars, weak story, acting and characters, and extremely unrealistic. The only thing that didn't do it for me was the love interest, that actress didn't appeal to me, maybe if she had a different hair style.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game because the stuf that you can buy is great for this app it is wonderful game.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|I am old school, I grew up watching what was once called \\"secret agent\\" movies like \\"It takes a thief\\" starring Robert Wagner and so forth.<br />So in short I enjoyed Ghost Protocol very much and Tom Cruise was excellent in it as always.
B007MAETA8|5.0|In '05, I took my then 16-year old daughter to see John Mayer at The Gorge in Washington state. It was fun. He played some of his top tunes at the time. And I didn't pay much mind for the next several years. I had several of his songs -- mostly from 'Room for Squares' -- on burned CDs, and always enjoyed them.<br /><br />Then, on a car ride a couple months ago, I came across 'Stop This Train' on a CD that a friend had left in my car. I was entranced by it -- the lyrics, the music, his voice. Since then, I've collected all of his work, and really studied his lyrics. To say he's a genius seems trite. His lyrics are unlike any other musician's. Take a song like 'Belief' -- what an incredible anti-war song. 'Atmosphere' and 'Comfortable' -- astonishing lyrics and tunes. He does things not just with his guitar, but with his voice, and with his lyrics, that set him apart. There's something about JM that is so different, it's hard to put into words. Many feel the same as I do -- look at the reviews here that go on and on. We're trying and trying and trying ... but some things, and people, are not to be defined.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect on Born and Raised. When I first listened to it, I struggled with it. It was 'different'! Good for JM, and us! This is NOT 'the same old John'. New stuff. New feel. New MAN. And terrific! I've listened to it about 10 times now. Love this stuff. Love everything he does. As each of us should be doing, he continues to change and grow. And what is going on within him, shows up in his music. May he keep changing and growing and surprising us -- and may we do the same in our own lives.<br /><br />If you're not yet a fan, hop on board, friend. See how his work affects you ... because it will.<br /><br />Last note -- if you haven't seen the DVD 'Where the Light Is' ... you owe it to yourself. It's riveting. Brilliant filming that captures him from multiple angles. Astonishing to watch, all the way through.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games will surprise the reader who expects a dismal story, knowing ahead of time the plot deals with a teenager forced to compete against other young people in a fight to the death.

B00401ZEA6|5.0|I really recommend this shoe. It seems to fit my daughter's feet perfectly with room to grow. They're great walking, running, jumping, and playing summer shoes. They seem very true to size to me whereas the classic clogs seem a bit big.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep is incredible in this performance. It's well-established that she's a great actress, so this should come as no surprise. It's her performance that makes this film worth watching. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only thing. The story jumps back in forth in time too much, and we never get a great sense of the other characters or get a chance to really sink into the story. Many events that I think would be worth exploring are passed over too briefly.<br /><br />As to this DVD release, the movie looks and sounds great, so no complaints there. But I was disappointed by the lack of good special features. I think it would have been nice to include a documentary about the real Thatcher as a supplement. I like when historically-based films include real footage and interviews to illuminate the history and give some background, as this can help the view appreciate what the film did in bringing it to the cinema.<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing, but only worth purchasing if you are a die-hard Streep fan.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is great, but of course there are parts of it that want you to use real money. not looking forward to that
B007H9B8FS|4.0|From the very first notes of Automatic Systematic Habit, it's clear that Garbage has found their sound again. Given their tendency to experiment, resulting in each album having a very different feel, this is a statement that sort of makes no sense. But if someone talks about Garbage's sound, I think fans know what this means: driving rhythms, layered effects, singing and playing with attitude. Their first album was their best, but I love Version 2.0 and beautifulgarbage, as well. Their previous album was all right, but I'd have to say it didn't have that extra spark of greatness. That spark is back with Not Your Kind of People.<br /><br />The songs are strong. The playing is tight. Shirley Manson hasn't aged a day, and her voice sounds fantastic. This album rocks. Whether it can bring in new younger fans, I could only guess. But it's definitely not just some nostalgia trip for a \\"90s band.\\" It's a great return from a longtime favorite. I hope this isn't the last we hear from this fantastic group.

B007PKOKTK|2.0|Sorry, folks, but this is not a good movie. The premise behind this flick is too silly for words; to me it looked like someone took every cheesy son-of-Santa movie, stuck them in a blender, hit puree, and then used a word processor to replace the word Christmas with Easter.

1401235417|5.0|I'll say right now that is the best Batman book I've read since Heart of Hush, the antagonists and their minon are very cool and the best part is that these are new villains and they really feel like they have staying power and are not just a throw away villain of the month type thing. Like all great Batman books this one both builds on and feeds off of the mythos and expands it in new and interesting ways. Five stars straight up. Buy it and you won't regret it.
B007NCSQFO|3.0|I wasn't expecting as much pop as the album has but I will name the songs I do and don't like<br /><br />Like:<br />Roman Holiday<br />I Am Your Leader<br />Hov Lane<br />Pound the Alarm<br />Va Va Voom<br />Gun Shot<br />Whip It<br />Right By My Side<br />Starships<br /><br />Hate:<br />Stupid Hoe<br />Marilyn Monroe<br />Come on a Cone (Not feeling this at all)<br />And the rest of the album<br /><br />But I got the album when it leaked, so I can't really complain about something that was free for me :)<br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought I loved this book.I would jump up and down in the hallways of school and sing about The Hunger Games.But then there was going to be a movie!I thought the movie would be great but it was not.The more and more talk I would hear about the movie.The talk brought my spirits down about the book.I saw the movie and went over the book in my head.I guess it just got worn out.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I listen to it at work, at the gym, in the truck, around the house, everyday since its release. It is complete wholesome Rock n Roll from beginning to end, with every song leading me to the repeat button. I find it hard to make it through the whole album before getting interrupted, and this can be upsetting at times.<br /><br />I'd write a lengthy review, but plain and simply put - if you are thinking about it, stop thinking and buy it, you will NOT regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book was great,the second wasmarvolous and this book was just...okay.It was kind of confusing.The book was filled with unexiting combat.There was little talk of Gale.Also wha did Collins do with Peeta?So many people died out of thin air.I did not like the charaters attitudes very much in Mockingjay.The end is boring and uneventful.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Lives up to the Mission Impossible jaundra for sure. ACTION all the way.<br />GREAT ride.  Would watch it again just for fun.

B0028LY7A8|4.0|OK OK OK, I know \\"Breakfast in America\\" might be the best selling album, and it could be Supertramp's career-defining work, or any other hyperbole you want to throw around; For MY MONEY, though, these two albums are Supertramp's best and most entertaining discs. What a great balance of Hodgson's pop sensibilities and mastery of melody and Davies' love of jazz and progressive stylings. JUST PERFECT !  It seems some tracks in the Supertramp catalogue reveal a little too much poppiness (ie: Commercial-sounding jingles) or a little too much R&B jazziness (ie: cheesy) --- As I get older some of the music that I used to listen to can make me cringe now (even from great bands).  These two Supertramp albums, to me, have stood the test of time.  I know this review doesn't reveal much in the way of the songs --- sorry. Maybe this is just to convince casual listeners that this is the place to start and end your Supertramp experience.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow! This book was very well written with a fantastic depth of characters. You will feel for the families and their pain, their struggles to deal with life's realities. This is one of those rare books that stays in your thoughts. Disturbing, entertaining, thought provoking. As a parent, I highly recommend this one and will look for other works by this author.

1401234542|3.0|Graphic Novel Review by Kole for Book Sake<br />Let me start of by saying Green Lantern is my favorite superhero by far.  But this book has the same issue as with all of The New 52's.  It's still pretty much a continuation of an old series or storyline.  It starts off with Green Lantern being exiled from the corps, and Sinestro had been reinstated, but it never showed this happening, probably because it happened in another book (that some people may not have read).  Obviously I'll continue to read it (because I love Green Lantern) and understand it, but it still frustrates me that they don't give anything an actual fresh start.  They just slap on the words \\"The New 52\\" and continue selling the same stuff.  As a fan, yeah, it's a good book.  I feel like if I review anything by DC that's labeled \\"The New 52\\" I'm going to be complaining about this.<br />Book Rating:  4/5<br /><br />Graphic Novel Review by Chris for Book Sake<br />This is the 5th of DC's New 52 re-launched novels I've read and I've got to say it's been a really soft re-launch. I know who Green Lantern is, I used to watch the Justice League cartoon when I was a kid and I saw the new movie, but I had no idea what was going on in this book.<br /><br />I was thinking the book was about Hal Jordan (aka Ryan Reynolds) but it seemed more about Sinestro. By the way Sinestro is a good guy. Oh yeah, Green Lantern isn't a Green Lantern anymore. I'm not spoiling anything, that's how the book starts off.<br /><br />I am sure this book is a decent continuation of the Blackest Night and Brightest Day stories, but since I didn't read those I feel like I am starting on book 3 of 3 part story. Even worse, I may be starting on book 100.<br /><br />It isn't really all bad. It is a superhero story after all, what's to really know? Big bad, big good, big muscles, and big fights. The art was average superhero fare. Current readers will dig it, new readers will have to ingest some back story to even figure out why some events matter, let alone care about them.<br />Book Rating: 2/5matter, let alone care about them.<br />Book Rating: 2/5
B005LAIHGI|4.0|the jokes...some crude...most clever...all whizzing by faster than some can catch before another sharpie stings us somewhere and somehow...<br /><br />Sacha B C is a master at at being  and showing us the unexpected...or whoever wrote script helped him a bit too... This guy star is  tall, handsome and looks weird in a beard... but once that is removed,, he dances all over ...insulting every one every thing anywhere and also all in sight.<br /><br />I'm impressed by alll the jokes that flew  by me so fast ...that now I have to re-see this film and laugh at  the jokes I got and then find the ones the movie threw at us  that jumped away. Loved it.<br /><br />Some of us are very picky movie viewers, going seldom because we reject so much... including those too many made for 12-1/4 year old males. In fact the  3 trailers before the Dictator came on  and that we were force-fed to sit thru were AWFUL....loud, crass, unfunny, foul language used to elicit some kind of response with the same old old old stupid slapsticks.<br /><br />So the movie we paid dearly for - the Dictator - himself came on when we were ready  to walk out. But being particular also means enjoying the unusual, the uncommon, the odd, the dissident and different and the de Cohen moves.<br /><br />Fast and furious - as in angering the P C public - this film is a gem, a must-keep, a fun funny movie.<br /><br />wanna try it for yourself and then report how delighted you to might become ? I did.

1613771355|4.0|My 4 star rating is for the quality of the actual book, which is a lovely large format hardcover binding of the wonderful graphic novel.<br /><br />My rating for my Amazon purchase is 1 star. VERY BAD.<br /><br />The problem here is that Amazon advertised this as a signed and numbered copy and I, like many other reviewers, bought it because of that. My order was placed in November of 2011 and the release date was changed numerous times (6 at my last count) but I stuck it out. Having finally received my copy (which again is beautiful), I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that it was neither SIGNED NOR NUMBERED. Amazon customer service was extremely unhelpful as they had no information and wouldn't/couldn't transfer me to someone who did, but I am most frustrated by the fact that Amazon has now changed the product description so that it doesn't say SIGNED AND NUMBERED. This feels underhanded and is seriously troublesome.

B007L96VCY|5.0|When I bought the remasters for BOTR, McCartney, and McCartney II they all sounded pretty good when compared to the original, but nothing really blew me away. This, however, did. It's the best remastering job I ever heard on an album connected to Paul McCartney. The drums, cymbals, and the orchestrations never sounded so crisp and clear as they do now. And if there was one post Beatles album I didn't think could be improved upon with 21st century technology it was \\"Ram\\". I was wrong and I'm so glad I was because the listening experience was such a pleasent surprise.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan this remaster is a must have. If you're a casual fan buy it anyway you won't regret it. Now I have to get the deluxe set to finally hear the mono version that people have been raving about for more years than I care to count.

No quirks aside from the stand which helps greatly for hands-free reading (makes it easy to set on the treadmill too). It doesn't snap shut with a button or fastener and that is a feature I usually like to have in a Kindle case. It's about as sturdy as its peers in the low- to mid-level price range of Kindle Fire cases. There's nothing about this product worth damning but at the same time there's nothing in particular that makes it stand out.
1439190275|5.0|Others have praised the Atkins die and this book and I have little to add.<br /><br /> However, unlike most diet books, its major statements are backed by citations to the scientific literature. Surprisingly, most diet books lack citations to the science behind their suggestions, even though the authors are often recommending something that is the opposite to what others are saying to do, relying on their person reputations (often for authors you had never heard before, to convince you to make a major life style change). Not only are the suggestions here backed by science, you can actually discover what the science is. This should make the book useful to those who want to learn more, but may not wish to follow the Atkins plan in all of its details.<br /><br /> The citations make it clear that Atkins type diets (controlled carbohydrate ones) are healthier than many competing ones, and that you should not worry about high fat or protein consumption (a logical consequence of cutting carbohydrate consumption), even if one exceed the \\"official recommendations on fat consumption. These discussions could make the book useful to those following other diet plans (such as South Beach or Protein Power).<br /><br /> Most of the citations are to papers published since Atkins died. Hence this book, rather than one by Atkins himself should be the one bought by those interested in the Atkins diet (either to do it, or just considering it). New developments include suggesting added salt (or a broth), and using Stevia as a sweetener (which has become possible only since Atkins passed)., and recognition of the US food labeling rules regarding trans fatty acids.<br /><br /> While the copyright is held by the Atkins Nutritionals, the book does not seem to have a commercial focus (I did not see even a direct endorsement of that firm's products). When I might have expected such an endorsement (in discussing snacks for instance), their products are missing from the list of suggested foods.Indeed, it makes a point of saying to avoid too much use of such packaged products, and in particular not let them reduce your vegetable consumption.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|Twenty-something Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) has used his good looks and flirtatious charisma for years to become a highly successful salesman. But as far as his father (George Segal), a successful doctor, is concerned, Jamie is wasting his potential and belongs in medical school instead. Then everything changes when Jamie goes to work for Big Pharma and strikes it rich in the billion-dollar bonanza of the release of the first erectile-dysfunction drug, Viagra, in the 1990s.<br /><br />Side-by-side with his ascendance as a high-earning drug salesman, light-hearted Jamie embarks on what he assumes will be simply one more in a long line of passing affairs with beautiful, twenty-six-year-old Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway). Maggie is in Stage 1 of Parkinson's disease and has no desire to form any close relationships, so theirs seems like an ideal pairing of superficial self-gratification. They swear to each other there will be nothing but hot, mindless sex between them (very reminiscent of the recent romantic comedies, [[ASIN:B004RC8NUQ No Strings Attached]] and [[ASIN:B00650SSDU Friends With Benefits]]), but unfortunately for the success of their no-hearts-allowed pact, inconvenient feelings of friendship and romance arise between them.<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the memoir by Jamie Reidy, [[ASIN:B002QGSVF2 Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman]]. It has been marketed by its promoters as as \\"a satirical look inside the culture of Big Pharma\\" as well as a romantic comedy, but it has more than a little of [[ASIN:B0009S4IH4 Camille]] and [[ASIN:B000059TEQ Love Story]] thrown in the mix as well.<br /><br />Many may find this movie the ideal \\"date flick,\\" because it's got bawdiness and nudity galore for the guys, and plenty of tear-jerking romance for the female portion of the audience. As one of those women, I certainly did like the \\"chick\\" parts the best, and the performances of these two very fine actors in the lead roles are definitely worth catching. They take what otherwise might be a confusing mishmash of a script and turn it into something quite watchable.<br /><br />By the way, Hathaway and Gyllenhaal obviously, as seems to be standard these days, had to work very, very hard with personal trainers to get utterly fit for their many, many nude scenes, and people who like to gawk at young, lithe bodies will appreciate that. It's too bad though, at least in my personal opinion, the vast majority of that nudity is gratuitous in that it contributed nothing to the story, merely providing (or so it seemed to me) prurient interest for the guys to keep them from getting too bored as they waded through the love-story portions of the film in order to return to the male-humor, Big Pharma antics that form the main body of the story.atching.

0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is the second book in the Hunger Games series. If you liked the first book, you will love this one. I read half of this book in 3 days, it is action packed, suspenseful, and there is a twist in the plot.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark are the \\"Star-Crossed\\" lovers from District 12. Ther have just returned to District 12 after winning the 74th Hunger Games. Only one person is crowned victor, and with two winning victors, President Snow isn't so happy with Katniss' actions. An underground resistance group is forming to go against the capital. Their symbol, a mockingjay. Just like the pin Katniss wears.<br /><br />With outbreaks of riots all throughout the nation, peacekeepers (police men or riot control) make new, harsh rules and regulations for citizens. President snow meets with Katniss and talks about her \\"consequences\\". Katniss, Peeta and the ones they love are in serious danger. The 75th Hunger Games are coming up. Its is called a quell, it happens every 25 years. 75 years ago they made the rules of this years games. This new twist will shock you, and leave you stunned. Katniss finds the true meaning and power of her Mockingjay pin. Katniss Everdeen of District 12, is the Mockingjay.<br /><br />This book can relate to real world situations in many ways. Life is not fair and never will be. Katniss and Peeta are turned on. People rebel against the government all of the time and fight for what they belive in. Katniss and Peeta aren't going to give up on their people.<br /><br />This book is INCREDIBLE. There is so much detail and suspense. This book is rated 10/10. This book shocked me with the twists and turns. If you read \\"Catching Fire\\" by Suzanne Collins, you won't be able to put the book down.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Overall it was a good read and an exciting conclusion to the series, yet there are just too many loose ends that I would prefer to be resolved. Also I thought the evolution of Katniss' character became a little too morose and, again, incomplete.<br /><br />Series such as these are often difficult to conclude, I can appreciate, however I felt too much of the side plots went unresolved here.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm afraid I can't add much more than what others have already written.  The book felt as though written by an immature teenager who fantasizes about strange sexual behavior with a slightly older/more experienced man.  As for me, it was extremely repetitive - reading the same terminology, same actions, same phrases over and over again.  The sex scenes were so tame, I'm still trying to figure out how this is deemed explicit material (probably only because of the use of sex toys & S/M).<br /><br />Really, don't waste your time, money, effort ... it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.
B000O599WG|2.0|I purchased Rio Bravo with some humility, knowing that Roger Ebert makes a case for it as a great film. So I watched it, dumbfounded. Then I turned on the commentary by critic Richard Schickel and director John Carpenter, and watched it again. I made it about half-way before I gave up. The emperor has no clothes.<br /><br />Not only is the film awful, but the commentary is inane bordering on stupid. Carpenter calls Rio Bravo \\"my favorite film,\\" but he doesn't get it that the Burdettes are big ranchers, not \\"a gang of thieves.\\" The \\"gang of thieves\\" would be in The Magnificent Seven, a movie released a year after Rio Bravo. Nathan Burdette wears, in the course of the film, three 19th C equivalents of Armani suits with Luchessi boots and a cream-colored Stetson that would go today for about $500. It's true that the sheriff identifies Burdette's men as \\"pros,\\" but that's just the fantasyland of cheap Hollywood westerns. What are they \\"pros\\" for? They apparently don't do anything but sit around Burdette's ranch being bad. Not like the pros Ryker hires in Shane (1954) to harass the settlers.<br /><br />The casting is amazing. Dean Martin actually looks good in comparison to Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickinson, who are embarrassments. Nelson's delivery of his lines is so arch and narcissistic that the only thing more irritating is how \\"pro\\" John Wayne repeats endlessly that he's \\"the real thing.\\" Horst Buchholz and Steve McQueen in The Magnificent Seven are the real thing; \\"Colorado\\" is a kid playing cowboy. Dickinson is burdened with dialog that Katherine Hepburn couldn't have made believable, and situations beyond any stretch of credulity. Her character is a bizarre anachronism (she has her first private conversation with Wayne in her underwear, but we are to understand that she is a \\"good girl\\" maligned by prejudice). Hawks wants to have it both ways with her, but he doesn't have Hepburn or Bacall to pull it off.<br /><br />Either Schickel or Carpenter claims that Wayne and Hawks made Rio Bravo as a response to 3:10 to Yuma -- a much better film released in 1957 -- because they found the notion of a \\"pro\\" asking the townspeople for help \\"disgusting.\\" Fairly bizarre, because Ebert quotes Wayne at length on how the film was a response to High Noon (1952) and the disgusting notion that the hardy frontier settlers wouldn't chip in to help. They aren't totally contradictory explanations, but fishy. They also explain that Hawks was responding to the decline of the screen Western and rise of mediocre TV westerns. This decline is evidenced by High Noon (1952), Shane (1954), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), The Last Hunt (1956), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), Bad Day at Black Rock (1957), The Searchers (1956), The Big Country (1958), Man of the West (1958), The Left-Handed Gun (1958), and Warlock (1959). And that's just the best of the bunch. Meantime, Hawks borrows from the TV western he despises claustrophobic sets, arch dialog, utter disregard for historical accuracy, hokey names (the five main characters are named Chance, Dude, Colorado, Stumpy and Feathers), and a plot that was a cliche the first time he used it, in a silent film. Rio Bravo is pretty much a big screen TV western.<br /><br />Carpenter would have us believe that Rio Bravo, in 1959, redefined the Western film. Hogswaddle. It was such a dead end that Hawks himself remade it twice (Eldorado and Rio Lobo). Within a year, Sturges had done one of the greatest westerns in the film canon, The Magnificent Seven (inspired by the greatest film ever made, Kurosawa's Seven Samurai), no thanks to Hawks. You couldn't put any more space between the lawmen of Rio Bravo and the Seven. Robert Vaughan drinks Dean Martin's milkshake as the self-doubting expert gunman, and Horst Buchholz owns \\"the kid.\\" Ford had made the other contender for best, The Searchers, three years ago, and would soon move on to Sgt. Rutledge and Liberty Valance. The best westerns of the early '60s owe littleto Hawks: The Magnificent Seven, Liberty Valance, The Unforgiven, Ride the High Country. And Hawks is not on any road map that will get you to The Wild Bunch.<br /><br />We are to love this movie for the music, by Dmitri Tiomkin (who wrote the theme for the despised High Noon). The only thing memorable about it is the strange variations on \\"As Time Goes by\\" that creep in when Wayne is talking to Dickinson. Ebert tells us the \\"No Quarter\\" song (the Deguello) haunts the entire film. Actually, after doing a five-minute set piece on it, Hawks forgets to keep it going -- as Burdette has supposedly paid the musicians to do. The score is barely noticeable and seldom even pertinent, especially in comparison to the incredible score Elmer Bernstein wrote for The Magnificent Seven.<br /><br />This is a silly movie, in a bad way. I loved it as a kid, but it's a movie made by adolescent impulses and sensibilities, with a homoerotic subtext that is childishly oblivious to itself. Chance is a lot more enchanted by Colorado, with his seemingly permanent kissy-mouth, than by Feathers, and Wayne's scenes with Dickinson are about as sexy as Archie's with Edith. This is a movie for boys who think girls are icky.<br /><br />Just a round of equivalences to The Searchers shows how immature the whole enterprise is. Compare Wayne's Ethan Edwards to John T Chance, Jeffery Hunter to Ricky Nelson, Vera Miles to Angie Dickinson, Stumpy to Old Mose, even the embarrassing cartoon \\"Mexican\\" hotel keeper to the Comanchero who finds Debbie.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow,<br />I must say I am laughing that this book has caused such a stir.<br /> And so many bad reviews....<br /><br /> First of all the book is a flight of fancy... do not expect any realism... and you'll have a fun trip.<br /><br /> I read and write erotica.. of all types, this book is of the the light fluffy, variety.<br /> Meaning it will give a little thrill to those whom don't normally delve into sex ridden books.<br /><br /> The fact that it is written in Ana's POV,  to me means that the author was deliberately giving any female whom believes she is undesirable a chance to experience a way to be \\"daring\\" and yet still a \\"good girl\\" at heart.<br /><br /> Mr. Grey is the ultimate tall, dark, handsome  and mysterious stranger that still lurks in the feminine mass consciousness as the desirable entity that all females should crave.<br /><br />If you let go and read the book to that part of yourself.. it's a fun and often funny ride... almost a parody.<br /><br />it's a story not made for the intellect, but for the emotions...<br /><br />I don't believe I've ever bitten my lip in my entire lip, so for me , it was fun to inhabit Ana and see what that is like.<br /><br />It's a fast read and like fast food, not nutritious, but often tasty.<br /> It's a summer fling, a beach book, try not to take it seriously, as [I certainly hope that] it was not the authors intent that you should do so.<br /><br />  I believe she may have wanted you to have a good time, a laugh, a giggle, something to chortle about with your closet girlfriends.<br /><br />i work with a bunch of 40 plus \\"good girl\\" women who are all reading these books and let me tell you I've never heard so much girlish giggling and chattering in my life. This book has made them happy... and that makes me happy, because most of the time they are a bunch of squawking hens.<br /><br />The book does what the author hopefully intended.. it titillates.
0345803485|4.0|After reading many of these reviews it seems that most people either love or hate this book. I'm going to take a more centrist stance and say that I was neither disappointed nor blown away, but that I quite liked it (and the succeeding 2 books).<br /><br />It's true that E.L. James won't win any awards for her prose, but does anyone honestly think that she set out to become the next Charles Dickens--or Henry James, for that matter?  I think the last 10 years of literary output have proved that today's authors don't need traditionally dexterous pens in order to become hugely popular. And in my opinion there's nothing wrong with that. There are many contemporary authors who can make you weep with three gloriously placed words or sweep you away with a single paragraph. James' book is notable for its story, characters, and subject matter rather than its stylistic merit.<br /><br />I found this glimpse into the world of BDSM utterly fascinating. True, I knew nothing about it prior to picking up this book and I can't vouch for its factual integrity, but it was still an eye-opening experience. I also thought that Christian's deconstruction from an all-powerful, (stereotypically) alpha male into a haunted man with insecurities and an emotionally crippling past was intriguing and rather satisfying. Anastasia's character came across as less dynamic and perhaps more 2-dimensional, but she still stands on her own as a romantic lead. We're all familiar with the wide-eyed, plucky ingenue character trope. The numerous sex scenes were definitely graphic and far from plausible, but as a dedicated romance reader I can say that they were no more or less graphic or plausible than the scenes found in popular romance. And to be honest, the sexual fantasy aspect of romance novels (broad chests, throbbing manhoods, etc.) are a big reason why many people love the genre. I personally don't want David Attenborough narrating my bodice rippers.<br /><br />So while the prose was underdeveloped and basic, the story itself and its exploration into darker waters was refreshing and thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />P.S. I would advise readers to complete the trilogy before making a final judgment on the book and the author. The characters' and the story's development span the entire 3-book arc and it would be somewhat unfair to judge James' overall merit solely on her first novel.
B007NZDES0|4.0|Being a Sade fan for a very long time I was a little concerned about the need for yet another live offering from them. This was actually a very well produced DVD. Apart from a few sound issues I really enjoyed it. The intro was great. Enjoyed all the songs even though her latest album was my least favorite.<br /><br />I do have some issues though, but they are just personal. I don't really feel like military themes and Sade belong together. Just me though. Also there are some really harsh electric guitar sounds which seems to clash with the Sade I know. Also on the DVD during Nothing Can come Between Us there is some crowd rousing by one of the backup singers - \\"Party people in the house, say oh yeah, now somebody scream.\\" This doesn't feel like something that should be part of a Sade concert, but then again that's just my opinion. There seems to be, however, a distinct lack of \\"wooooooooos\\" from the crowd, which I greatly appreciate. I see Sade as a mellow experience so sometimes these things seem out of place.<br /><br />Overall this is a very nicely produced DVD/CD set with some great extras. Made me wish I had seen her live. I am not willing to pay $300 for any show though. If you are a Sade fan you will like this, even though the material is redundant. Great deal as well especially since I only paid $10 for it on pre-order.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|As the tale unfolded so did the power of the story. It's fun to imagine great 'what ifs' like those revealed here from very early in the film, but to see them come to their logical conclusions without beating the viewer over the head is why Woody Allen is still such a gifted film maker.<br />Owen Wilson's character is such an average guy that even his wardrobe is boring, too sensible and while well made it's also indistinct. That matters because it's a reflection of the character who has such extraordinary experiences that he becomes both a focus and a kind of background. His soon to be wife seems all right if a little overbearing, and unimaginative, but she dresses in style, she's sexy and young and has no problem showing it. Unfortunately where her clothing and attitude are more provocative her mind is drab, as are her ambitions. As the couple meets with friends and family in Paris the city is revealed as both an escape and a dream though still grounded in it's daylight and late evening hours with the occasionally rude waiter or brusque citizen, just like all large cities. The fantasy lies in the situation and not on misguided ideals.<br />When Wilson's character discovers a secret about about the city at midnight he's not sure what to make of the revelation but simply notes the oddness and goes with it. He probably accepts things as they are because in many ways he is living out what were fantasies now becoming a reality he should not be able to see, much less experience.<br />The trick of an experienced reality -as it is utilized in this construct- is that it impresses itself upon you as another layer of actual life and not as a delusion. Not only do you want to believe it, it almost has an inherent sense to it. That is where the premise succeeds where so many other attempts to do this in other films fail.<br />As the night life absorbs more of Wilson's character's interest the more effort he makes to balance out the two worlds, at least at first. The new reality also begins to show the rifts in the daylight life. Small ones we often take for granted are suddenly more obvious but also acceptable. His interaction with the noteworthy denizens of Paris' late evening crowd becomes a given, like he has two lives to live.<br />All I can conclude is how well this worked for me as well as the perfectly imperfect conclusion. It doesn't wrap up so much as it provides a stepping stone for the characters and audience to move on.<br />I like the running observations of the two prevailing views of Paris expressed by the characters because this is how a lot of Americans react to the city. I admit that I fall in the category that finds the city to be somewhat magical, even in it's reality and imperfections. And as such I don't expect anyone to agree with me.
0345803507|5.0|Great story!  This last book concludes on the note of Grey finally coming to terms with his past and looking at his new future. Thereis so much that comes to light in this last book. What a wonderful, intense love story this has been.  I couldn't put it down. I loved evey minute of the entire trilogy.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is some of the most brilliant television I've ever seen.  Season one was great, and I didn't really think it could be topped, but I was wrong.  The writing, and the acting have only gotten better, and the modern interpretations of classic Sherlock Holmes stories are fascinating.  Everyone involved with this production is on top of their game.<br /><br />I really hope that there's a season three, four, five, and so on. Masterful storytelling.
B007L96SI6|5.0|A refreshing debut album compared to much of the other heavily auto-tuned/over-produced Idol debuts.  Haley has a truly wonderful voice!  The album is very good.  It definitely has a pop feel (after all, it does have to sell) and is a bit over-produced in areas like in the first song \\"Oh My\\" where she collaborates with a rapper.  However, it still showcases her tremendous voice.  Lots of soul and a bit of funk with a retro feel.  Think of Pixar, which has to make money from a target market, yet adds in material to make it relevant, fun and entertaining for us \\"older\\" folks.<br /><br />Favorite song: Still too early to say.  Others aren't kidding when they all songs are good.  Soon as I have a favorite I listen to another and like that one best.  At this moment I'd have to say \\"Wonderland\\".  Great debut and I'm looking forward to future performances as this great young talent develops!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading Slammed. A couple of months ago my BFF told me that she loved it, and that I had to read it... so I impulsively downloaded it to my Kindle and started reading, without even reading the synopsis. Holy crow, I was not prepared for the emotional roller coaster I had just strapped myself into!<br /><br />Slammed is a heart-wrenching story about love and loss. It's about life - rolling with its punches, and punching it in the face when it seems to get the better of you. It's about family - the family you're bound to by blood, and the family you choose.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has created some fantastic characters! I loved Layken, her family, her best friend Eddie, and of course Will and his brother. All the characters are well written and play an important role. I'm so excited that there's a sequel, [[ASIN:B007D90ALU Point of Retreat (Slammed #2)]] (written from Will's POV), so I can spend more time with these characters!<br /><br />This book left me stunned. It pulled at every single one of my heartstrings. It made me cry, more than once... but I snickered a few times too. It made me crave the words of these characters' poetry, and I now have to Google to see if I can find slam poetry nights near me. If you can't tell from this gushing review, I highly recommend Slammed!
B00756GKBA|1.0|This is a mundane hip-hop pop dance mix of trashy songs.  Quickly tumbling down in the re-use CD market at $5 a piece now because it is really crap, no one wants to keep a copy.<br /><br />About the music, where do I start... For a few years now I think Madonna has been trying to be someone she's not. Who is she trying to be? Kesha or Katy Perry in her 50s?<br /><br />Perhaps track 11 'Masterpiece' is the only one I found memorable.<br /><br />The Minaj songs are the worst, they sound like bubble gum. There is no surprise, it's a formula that has been tried in the top 40 pop radio market over and over again in the last few years.<br /><br />Long gone is the freshness of retro-dance masterpiece Confessions on a Dance Floor or electronica dance marvel Ray of Light.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|More predictible than the first 2 books. I was disappointed in the ending and the harlequin like quality to the story.
0345803493|5.0|What a wonderful love story.  I couldn't put it down.  I loved the characters and the mystery that surrounds Mr. Grey.  He is such an enigma and you have to keep reading to see him for who he truly is.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is a wonderful historical fiction piece of literature. The novel focuses on a tone of very dark and difficult situations. It is narrated through Death, which could not have been a better choice. Death is quite cynical throughout the novel because of everything he must witness. In a way he finds joy in keeping up with Liesel Meminger, who is the main character of the novel. The other main characters include Hans Hubermann, Rosa Hubermann, Rudy Steiner, Max Vandenburg, and Ilsa Hermann. All of these characters have a close bond with Liesel. I would say that the intended audience for this novel would be students from middle to high school. It is written in a way for teenagers to easily understand. In general, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. It is a good representation of life in Germany for children during Hitler's reign and the Holocaust. Also, due to it being written from Death's point of view, readers get an insight to all the horrible things going on during the time. For me, the main purpose of the book was to let readers realize the horror in Germany in the late 1930's/early 1940's. I agree with this purpose because it was written well and tells the story in a relatable way for teenagers. I like how Death follows Liesel's life occurrences. I feel as though Zusak did this because she was the only hope for humanity in Death's eyes. Overall, Zusak did a fantastic job at writing this novel. Not only is it informative in many ways, it also drags the reader in to finish the book.

I seriously don't think that it'll be topped as my favorite album of 2012. ...but this is all subjective. Give it a listen and decide for yourself.
B00127RAJY|3.0|dvd arrived within a week. i am a fan of Jillian Michaels DVDs, but gotta say this one was kinda boring to me? good workout, but found myself putting in one of her others one half way through to finish my workout. i would suggest her \\"killer buns and thighs\\" or \\"six week six pack\\". those are a little more fun to do.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love it! I can play with all my friends and family! idk about u peeps who do not like it but I love it!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I understand this Trilogy is not for everyone.  Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship.  The controlling main character has had a terrible childhood and shows himself to be scarred to no end.  With that said if you can read the love story and how the two main characters build and how Ana helps him to grow and try to trust his feelings through out the trilogy.  Erotic as they are I Enjoyed the books.
B001DTA8QS|4.0|I've got all bar one disc of this set in the original separate cd issues which I love. I bought this budget set on the German Decca Eloquence label because I saw that it was remastered and cheap - and might allow me to slim down some of my collection. However, a note of caution, the remastering is done using a technique called AMSI (Ambient Surround Imaging) which has created a slightly more resonant acoustic. However, over sustained listening, I prefer the original damper sound for these recordings as, to my ear, this brings greater focus to the various voices within the counterpoint, with no unintentional blurring of edges. Don't get me wrong, the set is still very nice and a steal at the price - but I prefer the original mastering. Others may prefer this edition, it's a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />There is no documentation in this edition other than track listings - and these are all in German - but this is, after all, a German edition and very inexpensive.<br /><br />N.B. The original (more expensive) box set listed on this site as [[ASIN:B00000IP73 Bach: Solo Keyboard Works [Box Set]]] (ASIN: B00000IP73) uses the original mastering.
0545305497|5.0|I purchased this set for one of my granddaughters.  She read these books in school and was so excited when the movie came out.  I wanted to read the books too, so I purchased them and read them first before giving them to her.  The story is fast moving and quite interesting. Lots of violence, but the heroine is a very moral and upright girl.  Good for young girls to read.
B007OXWWX4|5.0|Simply stated, this album is insanely good from beginning to end. There are no filler tracks. Definitely spend the extra money to get the bonus tracks. Carolina, One Last Thrill, Anastasia, Apocalyptic Love, Bad Rain, Hard&Fast are all tied for first in my book.<br /><br />Also the bonus version comes with a code to redeem for a free t-shirt. I had to pay $6.50 for shipping but the $25 shirt was free.<br /><br />A true rock album
B0024FAR5M|5.0|great show, addicting to watch. have purchased the first 3 seasons, waiting for season 4 to become available for purchase. great price! disc was in perfect condition. bought season 2 from the same seller, and it arrived pretty quick. same week as purchase.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I always wanted a Stevie Wonder album growing up, I would always hear his music in movies and everybody always had good things to say about his albums so as I got olders I had to do Research on Mr. Wonder and what I found out was astonishing the man has over 20 Grammy Awards, Classic Albums, Talented Musician, Great Voice to go along with it but there is one album during his Classic Period I find very addicting and that is Songs In The Key Of Life to make a long story short you will never really have to hit the skip button, this truly is his best album of his career but enough talk go and buy it U will be Amazed.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been playing picross ever since the GBA made it famous, and have played it on the Nintendo DS, online, and iPod Touch.  I had not found a good Android picross app until now.  I have tried maybe 10 or so and this is the only I like.  Not only like, love.  Easy to maneuver, flip, great that the numbers are on all edges, easy to select.  I can't wait for more content at each level, those later ones look brutal.  Awesome picross app, can't go wrong with this one.

B000002N1E|5.0|With this album Prince won back a lot of his fans that were Bashing him due to Recently poor Releases by The Purple One but he came back to His Roots and infused Purple Rain and Sign O The Times together and you get The Gold Experience but anyway let's talk about some of the songs \\"P Control\\" this song is so Hilarious with Prince Rapping, Saying The N Word, Cursing it really starts the album off well. \\"Shhh\\" a great slow Jam for the album it recently was on Tevin Campbells album (I'm Ready) but Prince version is way better and longer. \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\\" my favorite track off the album it's great to listen to with your Girlfriend. \\"Dolphin\\" love the Guitar Beat, Prince wanting to be a Dolphin and would he still be loved the same as a Dolphin. \\"Shy\\" probably my second favorite song off the album. \\"Gold\\" great way to end the album sounds like the 90's version of Purple Rain. Overall this is Prince Best Album in the 90's So buy while you can.

014241543X|4.0|If I Stay opens up to a snowy Winter morning; one in which school has been canceled due to the weather. In a celebration of sorts, 17-year-old Mia takes a ride with her parents and younger brother to see some friends of the family. A devastating car accident cuts their day of fun short in a terrible way. Mia gets out of her family's ruined vehicle only to find that her parents are both dead, and her brother is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />As Mia searches the accident site, she finally spots someone buried among the wreckage. Upon seeing the only visible part of the body - an arm - Mia realizes the person she's looking at is herself.<br /><br />After she is rushed to the hospital, Mia's astrally projected form stands by and watches the doctors try to save her broken body. In the end, though, the decision of whether to stay or leave is solely up to Mia herself.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />*SPOILERS AHEAD!*<br /><br />I am all for a love story. Truly. I love love. Unfortunately, the romance-y part of this book bugged me a teensy bit. I sort of wish Mia didn't solely choose to stay based on whatever her boyfriend said to her; whatever vow he made to her while she was in that limbo. I wish there was impact from another source, maybe combined with Adam's devotion, that helped her come to the ultimate decision to stay. I guess I am just a little tired of seeing girls in YA fiction be so dependent on a boy for happiness.<br /><br />Despite my feelings on the above issue, I have to admit that the romance was still beautiful, and I still appreciate how much Adam loved Mia to make such a vow and how much Mia loved him to come back when her parents and brother were all dead. It wasn't original, but it was still beautiful and Forman portrayed it in a creative way.<br /><br />Half of the book is present tense, written in time-stamped sections over a 24-hour period of time. It's from Mia's POV (her astrally projected form - though that wording is never used. It's really just speculative) while her body is fighting for life in the hospital. She sees her family and friends, how they react to her accident and all of the surgeries and things she must go through. There is also a lot of inner dialogue during the present tense. The other half of the book is pieces of the past; flashbacks - a way for us to become more acquainted with Mia, her family, her situation, etc. In just the very small portion of the book before the accident occurred, Forman did an amazing job of making me love Mia's family. I cried for the accident - I was sad that her parents died. I'd say it's pretty damn impressive to make characters so likable in less than 15 pages. The montage of Mia's life prior to the accident seemed sort of like a life-flashing-before-your-eyes thing... like they say happens before you die, you know? That's just how I thought of it, anyway. It had a high impact on me as a reader. I really do love the way this book was written.<br /><br />The way she wrote this book also gave Forman the opportunity to build her characters extremely well, and that she did! They are multidimensional, engaging, full of personality, and I felt a connection to each one. I think it was especially important to let us get to know Mia's parents and brother more, which we did through those flashbacks. It made the whole book that much more heartbreaking.<br /><br />Overall, this story is a roller coaster ride of emotions. It definitely made me cry. I didn't bawl through the entire thing, but it had some very powerful and moving moments. Mia struggled while in limbo; she grappled with the decision on whether she should stay or leave - I think that struggle was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time. This book left me breathless and it all came down to a very powerful ending that had me in tears. I'd recommend this book to older teens, as there is some gore and language. It's a wonderful book and I am quite happy I finally picked it up!culative) while her body is fighting for life in the hospital.

B00004SZWB|5.0|It is 1980 the 70's is finally over but as we enter a new Decade An Icon by the name of Stevie Wonder Drops his Last Great album in his Legendary Career and what a great Album this is Riding off all the Benefits from his previous Album (Songs In The Key Of Life) this may not be on the same level as Songs... But what a Valiant Effort he put forth here is some of my Favorite Tracks \\"Master Blaster Jammin\\" \\"Lately\\" \\"All I Do\\" Rocket Love\\" \\"Happy Birthday\\" Etc... Those are some of the favorites of mine off the album but the only song I didn't like was the terrible \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" but other than that this is his best album in the 80's phase of his Legacy.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|You, as a consumer of the food that is sold in the U.S.A. has the right to know the truth. The truth is in this film, and it is an ugly truth. Americans have been tricked, backstabbed, lied to, and poisoned by the very people we have elected into our government. Inhumane treatment of our livestock and inhumane treatment of our peoples. We think we have no choice but too fall victim to their control of our diets and our health, but we do have a choice and the power to change it. The more Americans who watch this film the better. Even young teens should know the truth, they are the future, the more people that know the truth, the more power we have as citizens. Knowledge is power. Don't let the food indistry dictate how and what you eat. We are the consumers, we can change it. Know the truth. Watch this documentary. Share it with everyone you know. It is THAT important.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|Having loved this play over the years, I was a little hesitant about the film.  But it did not disappoint.  While there is no good way to replicate a two-actor stage production, the movie does a good job staying true to a fascinating story, with a nice balance between well-done scares, without being too in-your-face and ruining the creepiness of the setting.<br /><br />A great adaptation overall, and the ending is a much-watch for any fans of the play.
B002ZG97M4|3.0|Craig Brewer (\\"Hustle & Flow\\", \\"Black Snake Moan\\") would seem to be an unlikely choice for directing this update of the 1984 minor classic of the same name.  Replacing Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as the teenage leads are dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough.  While neither is quite ready for the Oscar walk, they hold their own on the acting thing and are more than qualified in the dancing department.<br /><br />The cornball story line has to do with the aftermath of a tragic car accident which killed 5 of small town Bomont, Georgia's teenagers.  Returning from a dance, the driver lost control and hit a semi-truck head on.  As a result, the town's (pop. 19,000) preacher (and father of the driver) leads the city council to set curfews for teens and outlaws loud music and dancing.  Ren (Wormald) moves to Bomont from Boston after his mother dies to live with his uncle and his family.  Ren discovers Ariel (Hough) who is the sister of the ill-fated driver and daughter of the Rev. (Dennis Quaid).  She's gone from nice girl to naughty girl after her brother's death, but mom and dad don't recognize her own pain.  Ren, of course does.  And when they discover they can both dance pretty well, they decide to try to overturn the arcane laws put in place.<br /><br />Brewer and his choreographers do a good job of mixing up the dancing routines which range from country line dancing to acrobatic breaking, locking and popping.  All good although I thought Hough's abilities were restrained.  Her dance time was mostly sexy accompanying to Wormald's leads.  There's nothing really special about this movie, but I admit my toes were tappin' throughout.<br /><br />The 1080p Blu ray disc has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is near perfect in every regard.  Beautiful sharp, clear photography transfers with no faults that I could see.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is equally excellent.  Give Paramount credit on this one.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the movie and then I decided to buy this book. I read it in 2 weeks and I couldn't stop reading until I finish it. Very recommended
0439023513|1.0|****************************Contains Spoilers***************************************************************************<br />Where do I start. Tonight is finally the night that I was able to finish this series in which I started years ago. I could not bring myself to finish this book after re-starting it three different times. You would think that the third and final book would be the best in a trilogy....boy was I wrong.<br /><br />First of all...the first hundred pages are incredibily dull and so hard to get into after the first two books draw you in right away. You would think the author who makes their anxious readers wait nearly a year for the third installment to come out to kick it of with a bang. Ya right.<br /><br />Second of all Katniss is such a strong character in the first two books and I loved that especially being a female. But Collins completey destroys that and puts her in the hospital every other chapter sedated because she is incredibly weak and whiny. That is where I should have stopped reading...oh wait that is why I stopped!! I was embarressed that I loved this character and she WAS so strong but then she becomes annoying and pathetic and absolutely unbearable. ( such as the Bella Swan character...and that is indeed an insult)<br /><br />Third all of the action scenes are so underplayed it is insulting. Why even call this book part of the Hunger Games series when ALL of the action (the very little action mind you) is so downplayed that it is ridiculous. The only action taking place in this book literally covers about two pages during each seperate fight scene. There will be very little dialogue between the characters and then she explains what happens after. In my personal preference I like to hear the characters going through the trials but if your the opposite then this is definately the book for you.<br /><br />Lastly, (only because I'm ready for bed) is that the characters that are killed throughout this book have no closure or even an ending we experiance. For goodness sake old Finnick who we grow to love in Catching Fire is wiped out in literally one line of this 390 page book and sweeped under the carpet for good. Also, she never go into detail about the IMPORTANT parts like when they get Peeta and Johanna out of the Capital, how they capture Snow, and talk about the details of Katniss's trial. She completely did everything wrong.<br /><br />I looked at other reviews before submitting mine because I was so disappointed in the books I needed to make sure I was not the only one who thought Collin's rushed the ending for a quick buck. I am upset that I gave money to this author and even more upset that I love the first two novels and will say I will never get a true ending to the series I love so much. To be completely honest, if they had not made a movie about this trilogy, I would have never tried once again to finish this horrible excuse for a book. There is practically no action, the dialouge is horrible, and if you are looking for any sort of romace between the characters, you will be sorely disapoointed, do not even bother.<br /><br />So all in all....do not expect a great novel, heck do not even expect one that will keep your attention. Expect a novel you have to keep trying to tredge through just to get to the very disappointing ending just to say you finally finished. Expect a quick and boring end to a series by an author that did not care enough about how we view the characters in the last novel to what could have been a potentially amazing trilogy.

B005D67ODC|5.0|Can't wait to get the next season. Dexter lives with a secret - he is a good and lovable, yes lovable, serial killer. He works with his sister for the police dept, often on his own cases - that gets interesting and adds to the suspense. He appeases his \\"dark\\" urges by killing bad serial killers. Part of the code he lives by is to only kill bad serial killers. Dexter is full of suspense and is violent. By using angles along with before and after sceen effects the show avoids showing stuff like knives entering flesh. You will still see lots of blood. A unique show. Cover your eyes for the blood sceens, but give it try.
B00006RCNJ|4.0|Andre Rieu is a Dutch violinist, conductor and composer and is best known world-wide for his waltz playing Johann Strauss Orchestra. His concerts are characterised by great pomp and sophistication.<br /><br />Andre Rieu himself is extremely passionate about his music and displays a certain 'joie de vivre' and a rare sensitivity to the interpretation of his compositions. This particular concert, however, being confined to a closed auditorium, somehow greatly downsizes the glamour and sparkle of the entire concert.....his live concerts set in the lush, green environs of  gardens adds to the joy of the music being performed which is lacking in this case. However, each track is superbly interpreted and executed and the choice of music for this concert is excellent too.<br /><br />As for the dvd itself, the audio is a bit muffled and blurry around the edges and the visual image could have been sharper and more vibrant too. This is a great pity - it tends to remove the sparkle from the entire performance. Andre Rieu dvds and cds are normally recorded par excellence. I bought the audio cd  - from Amazon - of the same performance and the audio quality of the music is tons better. The packaging is neat - no complaints there.<br /><br />This dvd is pleasant but not the best - you would do well to purchase the audio cd instead....this advice comes from someone who possesses almost the entire collection of Andre Rieu's concerts, so you can safely take my word for it!

145160713X|5.0|For the Love of Physics: From the End of the Rainbow to the Edge of Time, A Journey Through the Wonders of Physics by Walter Lewin<br /><br />\\"For the Love of Physics\\" is the wonderful, educational book that enlightens the layperson to physics.  Professor Lewin's passion for physics shines throughout the book as he takes readers on a journey from the tiniest particles to the utter vastness of our universe. Acclaimed MIT professor Walter Lewin, helps us see the world through the eyes of physics.  This book is in essence a two-part book, in the first part Lewin focuses on the basics of physics.  The second part has to do with his area of expertise, X-Ray Astronomy.  An enjoyable, instructive read that is perfect for the layperson who wants to learn about physics through a practical lens versus a mathematical one.  This 320-page book is composed of the following fifteen chapters:  1. From the Nucleus to Deep Space, 2. Measurements, Uncertainties, and the Stars, 3. Bodies in Motion, 4. The Magic of Drinking, 5. Over and Under, Outside and Inside, the Rainbow, 6. The Harmonies of Strings and Winds, 7. The Wonders of Electricity, 8. The Mysteries of Magnetism, 9. Energy Conservation - Plus ca change..., 10. X-rays from Outer Space!, 11. X-ray Ballooning, the Early Days, 12. Cosmic Catastrophes, Neutron Stars, and Black Holes, 13. Celestial Ballet, 14. X-ray Bursters! And. 15. Ways of Seeing.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A well-written book about physics that focuses on the beauty of it rather than the details.<br />2. Well-researched book that is accessible to the masses.<br />3. Professor Lewin's goal are to educate and to exude excitement over his topics...mission accomplished.  As a reader and reviewer, I appreciate the passion<br />4. An inside look at the world of a physicist.  The love for astronomy...Interesting.<br />5. One of the great strengths of this book is how Lewin educates his students on physics.  By using everyday experiences, he is able to convey complex topics in an understandable and hands on way.<br />6. There are some heart-warming and tragedy behind Professor Lewin's fascinating life and he is kind and brave enough to share them with the readers.<br />7. The wonderful world of optics.  One of the most fascinating optical phenomena...glories.<br />8. Newton's three laws of motion.<br />9. The gravity of the situation.  Mass vs. weight.<br />10. Does a wonderful job of properly attributing discoveries to their discoverers.<br />11. Answers a lot of everyday questions through physics: why is the sky blue, what causes rainbows, how do planes fly, etc....<br />12. The basics of sound waves. Myths debunked along the way.<br />13. Electricity in a whole new light.  Magnetism.  The physics of lightning.  The great Maxwell.<br />14. How energy works.  The various types and applications.<br />15. The second part of the book, the author concentrates in his area of expertise X-ray astronomy.  A tour deluxe of the x-ray universe. The author goes in more depth and takes you out of the classroom.  It feels like a memoir of sorts.<br />16. A lot of amusing tales regarding his days in the field.<br />17. Neutron stars, supernovae, black holes, neutrinos, pulsars..oh my!<br />18. Some of the most amazing facts you will ever read, \\"A teaspoon of neutron star matter would weigh 100 million tons on Earth\\".<br />19. X-ray bursts!<br />20. Stellar spectroscopy...the most powerful tool in astrophysics.<br />21. The golden age of cosmology.<br />22. Find out about Professor Lewin's \\"other\\" love.<br />23. Links, very helpful links that add depth to the topics discussed.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The Kindle version omits the picture inserts unless you count the links for the Kindle Fire.<br />2. This book is intended for the masses so those in the field of physics will find it too basic.<br />3. Let's face it, it pains me to say it but a lot of people just can't handle science even at its most accessible.<br /><br />In summary, after reading this educational book the quote that best summarizes it, \\" A woman does not want to be understood, she wants to be loved\\".  I apologize for not properly attributing the quote but I feel it captures the essence of this book.  Professor Lewis wants you to learn about physics but his focus is for you to fall in love with physics.  The love for physics will drive one's innate curiosity toward learning physics.  It's a wonderful philosophy to have and this book emanates rays of wisdom.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie should be a must for all men who are married or plan to marry, especially those who plan to have children! The acting and directing is wonderful, the action compelling. Get ready for an exciting movie through and through, in which real men, who are police officers on the beat, discover and share the secret of what is life really all about. \\"Courageous\\" models for men, who have not had a good example of what it means to be a good man and father, how to be both. It grabs you from the exciting action beginning and holds you spellbound as it develops solutions to the most challenging problems marriage and family present. We know that sadly, there is a growing number of men today who had little contact with their fathers because of so many factors, workaholism, drugs, alchohol, and other addictions, self centeredness, or whose fathers divorced them along with their mothers. Unfortunately, many of the things we learn, we learn after failure, not the best way to learn. But experiencing someone else's failure and subsequent regret, through a movie, can be a powerful tool to shape our own future and avoid regrets. When we leave this earth, all we take with us is the love of our family and friends, which is the only thing that lasts for all eternity. This is something we all know, but are we really convinced and ready to commit ourselves to a course of action to assure we will live the best lives we can live? See the movie - and share it with every young man or woman, and adult friends also!  At the end of the movie, the entire audience stood and clapped! You will too! Thank you, Sherwood Pictures, for another of the best movies I have ever seen!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|First this: WOW !!!  This film had us glued to the screen the entire time.  All the military action looked so real and the camera-work<br />was flawless.  As far as the plot is concerned you can read the other reviews since they cover that pretty well.  This film reminded me so<br />much of Black Hawk Down, and it was just as painful to watch those scenes where our soldiers get hit by enemy bullets, RPGs and grenades.<br />Some reviewers have said that some of the acting was not that great and I agree somewhat.  But I do not consider that to be a deficiency of the<br />film since some real Navy SEALS and not professional actors were used to provide the film an authentic look and feel of military maneuvers<br />and communications under very hostile conditions.  The plot of the film moves very rapidly and there is almost no irrelevant material<br />which should not be there.  Bullets are flying practically all the time.  Absolutely great entertainment.  On the other hand, because this film<br />is based on real military experiences (not necessarily the plot sequences in the film), it does serve to show us citizens the hell that our soldiers<br />and their families have to endure to serve their country.  I feel humbled by the real sacrifices which our men and women in uniform have to make.<br />This is a 5-star film and a 5-star honor to our military.  I highly recommend it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|if you forget things constantly, like I do, you'll want to give this a try. I just wish it could make a noise with the notification.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is fantastic.  I have watched this over and over.  You truly get to know the characters.  The interviews with the true soldiers are inspiring.  This is one of the best things HBO has put out.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It can take a little to get the hang of this game, but once that happens, you'd better clear up your schedule. I've been playing it for a while, and have gotten quite addicted.  The production values are good, and the puzzles get progressively better.<br /><br />My only potential complaint would depend on price of purchase. I'd easily pay $3. For more than that, ymmv.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I was surprised the author is male. Expats reads like a story written by a chick for chicks.Spends most of the time describing clothes,furnishings and social events.The other major theme seems to be chicks gossiping.<br />Great plot greatly marred by concentration on describing chinaware,meals etc.<br />Robert Dwyer
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were fantastic! Using my Kindle for the first time, made reading so comfortable.The story was so great that I couldn't put it down and I loss sleep!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I recommend this for all ages. It has so many different options and it doesn't take up a lot of storage. You DON'T NEED any real money, which is very rare nowadays.
B007MAETA8|1.0|Boring. Boring. Even more Boring.  All the songs sound exactly the same.  I don't know what he was thinking with this one, but this one stinks.  The whole 70's vibe is so out of place and sounds dated and tired.  There isn't even one stand out track on this one, it sounds like one slow boring song...the kind that you would change the radio station 10 seconds in. I have liked mostly all of John's albums...but this one is even more boring than all his past efforts.  You should pick this one up if you like to listen to the same song for 55 min, then it may be an enjoyable ride for you. If you like an album to have ups and downs and twists and turns than this is not for you...skip it.  If you like this sound...there is a band that does it 100% better called \\"Mother Hips\\" and the lead singer of that band has a couple of solo albums that are very good too his name is Tim Bluhm check them out instead.
0062119044|5.0|The novel's back-cover blurb makes no secret of the horror shown only at its climax -- a 1999 New York school shooting perpetrated by 15-year-old Kevin, the son of successful tourbook writer Eva Khatchadourian and advertising location scout Franklin Plaskett. There's nothing to spoiler in the bare facts. Nearly two years later, Eva struggles to make sense of her intensely problematic relationship with her now-imprisoned son in a series of letters to her \\"estranged husband\\" (so the blurb also tells us).<br /><br />If it matters to the reader, Lionel Shriver is a woman -- she changed her first name in her late teens, as she hated her given name. The school shooting in the novel takes place 11 days before Columbine, and this does get repeatedly mentioned in the novel, as do a number of other real-life school shootings from the 1990's.<br /><br />Anyway, it's the details of this detail-oriented novel that shouldn't be spoiled: Eva's lacerating and self-lacerating evaluations of herself and others drive the book. Is she a reliable narrator? Was Kevin born bad, made bad, or resulted from a combination of the two? Well, that's the novel, isn't it?<br /><br />I note that some reviewers have referred to this novel as a \\"thriller,\\" though there's nothing thrilling about it: I found it difficult to put down, but not because I was having a wild romp. You're stuck inside Eva's head for the entire novel, and that's going to be trying for a lot of readers. She isn't instantly sympathetic. I'm not entirely sure that she's even finally sympathetic, a judgement I'd extend to the two other main characters of the novel, her husband Franklin Plaskett and the eponymous Kevin.<br /><br />Plaskett needs desperately to believe in the possibility of the American Dream's happy nuclear family. This desire plays out in the novel as an escalating series of what seem to be willfully ignorant (or deludedly optimistic) evaluations of Kevin's escalatingly awful actions as a child and as a teenager. But Eva's also evaluating how much these evaluations are 'real' and how much they're feigned as part of a desperate need to believe in normalcy. But Eva's also the only window into the text we've got. So we return to reliability.<br /><br />Kevin himself is a marvelous creation, a Bad Seed who seems fully realized without at any point being explained. Is his growing darkness a matter of biology, upbringing, society, or all three? Is Eva's belief that there's something more recognizably and sympathetically 'human' beneath his facade of apathetic cynicism, a belief based on only a couple of incidents from Kevin's entire life, 'real' or just wishful thinking? But Eva doesn't indulge in wishful thinking in her narrative. Or doesn't appear to. Much. So we return to the evaluations the reader must make.<br /><br />If Shriver hadn't already been an established mainstream novelist when she delivered this novel, I'd imagine it could only have been marketed as horror. Some reviewers seem to believe that the novel is 'useful' as part of a national (American) conversation about school shooters and what creates them. I don't think so, really, except as a warning against moral and psychological reductionism, and a warning to tread carefully when attempting to assess blame. This is real horror: unnerving, nonexploitative, harrowing, anti-cathartic for the most part, built painstakingly through the accumulation of telling, closely observed and minutely portrayed detail. Highly recommended.But Eva's also evaluating how much these evaluations are 'real' and how much they're feigned as part of a desperate need to believe in normalcy.

0790734850|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. ACTION PACKED, FULL OF THRILLS, AND CROOKED COPS. IT'S A MOVIE THAT YOU'LL BE GLUE TO THE SCREEN BECAUSE THE FIRST SCENE IS AN ACTION SCENE
B005POK858|5.0|A fun little RPG in the style of 16-bit gems like Final Fantasy VI.  Story isn't as engrossing, but the occasional odd choice of phrase in the English translation made me feel particularly nostalgic.  Very enjoyable to play for 15 minute bursts.  definitely worth the $4, so don't be a jerk and side load the apk!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is the first installment of a series that counts two books. I heard many things about it and I had been compulsed to read it after all the praises for this book. Now, I'm going to add my own praise because you can't not read it.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking. What? Another book she's going to write it's a must read! So, yes, I'm going to write it's a must read but I've got my very own reasons why and I hope you'll understand and even, maybe, be tempted to read it.<br /><br />You know, sometimes you read books that are a light read because you need it and you enjoyed it so much that you can't help yourself but smile at the thought of this very book. But, it's not at all what this book is about.<br /><br />This book is about young people that are dealing with tough issues in their young life, showing more bravery, more maturity and more dignity than you could imagine. It's not too much, it just sounds true. Who never had to deal with something tough, something you have to deal with and held your head high no matter what? I remember what it was like and just for that very reason, this book is heartbreaking for me.<br /><br />I know it's quite personal, but somehow I'm sure you'll find Lake and Will wonderful with their flaws, their qualities, their complicated attraction to each other. You'll just want to read the next chapter and the next one too, just to \\"see\\" what's going on with them and in their life.<br /><br />Moreover, the pieces of slams are just gut wrenching. How not to feel and fall for this story? I was hooked from the first chapter to the last one, unable to stop reading even if I had things to do.<br /><br />So, yes this book is sad, yes there's fun things too, but first of all it's a book that makes you feel something. You're not into poetry? Nevermind! It's just this \\"little\\" thing that enhances all the plot, that gives more density to the characters that could be people like you and me.<br /><br />Even the writing style of the author is beautiful somehow. It's not flowrish, it's reflecting the inner thoughts, inner doubts, inner fears and inner screams of the main character. A main character I can easily relate to.<br /><br />So, yes, for me it's a must read because it creates something in me, something that makes me ache, something that makes me smile, something that just makes me think and it's also what I'm looking for.<br /><br />This book is for you if you're not afraid of drama, if you want a love story that's not all lovey-dovey, if you want \\"real\\" characters and if you just want to discover an author that has a story do be told.<br /><br />Now, even if I'm crazy in love with this book, I'm a little talent aback to know that there's a sequel already available. Of course, as soon as I finished this one, I bought the sequel but somehow I don't know what to think. In my opinion, this novel could have been quite perfect as a stand alone book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Fantastic App. We need. more like this one! I really like the paper roll history. Let's get more like this one!
B005WKKI96|5.0|I absolutly love Lila Downs!! This album is just as amazing as her others!! I listen to it over and over I cant get enough!

B0028R3NCU|5.0|That's about it really.  This reader is tough due to its simple design.  Have one attached to my key ring with lots of keys and it's still going strong.  Protects the sdhc card; easy to insert and remove the sdhc card; and did I mention that it's really tiny?!?!<br /><br />I bought three of these.  One as a spare, one to use every day (all my music is on a micro sdhc card and my car stereo reads USB), and one to give as a gift.<br /><br />I highly recommend this reader and hope you have the same positive experiences that I've had!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First off let me say that this is the first book that I have taken the time to review.  With the quality of this book at this price I felt I owed it to the author to thank him and let others know how good this book is.  The story summary isn't anything ground-breaking; boy comes of age, gains battle prowess and beats the bad guys, but it's the details that make this book shine.  The character depth and developement, the way the plot is revealed to the reader and subtle use of moral questions are all a cut above and make this book hard to put down.  So in summary, let me add my voice to the other reviewers and say that the 5-star rating is truly legitimate and the rating does not reflect the price, I would give this book a 5-star rating at brick-and-mortar bookstore prices.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After I read this book, I had to read the other two in the trilogy ..... I was captivated & curious ....and concerned for this young, inexperienced young lady!  If you read it, dig deep ..... there is a real love story there between two adults.  Predictable at times, it will hold your interest ....
B008469DGY|5.0|worth the 1.99 really fun gives me something to do I would definantly recomennd getting this app for all ages and if you like golf
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|book was great and the ease of buying and having it sent to my tablet was awsome and the price was cheaper then buying in a store in paperback.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|for the first few days I had this app I was totally obsessed with it. as a follower of many blogs I was so excited to be able to read them on the go with my kindle fire. but then, one day, suddenly and tragically, it said it couldn't authenticate my account and booted me off. every time I've tried to use it since I have to re-authenticate and it still shuts down again in less than 5 minutes. it breaks my heart to uninstall but it's gotten ridiculous. maybe it's just a weird glitch in mine, but if it had stayed working I would have given it 5 stars easily.
B0081JDMUW|5.0|Having heard all of the studio album releases from Joe Bonamassa, this latest effort is far and away the best one. Bonamassa has hit one out of the park this time around. From the moment that the first chord is struck on the opening track to the last note on the last track, the album is pure guitar fury. Bonamassa should be proud of this effort. There are two standout tracks on this album (not a clinker in the playlist). They are the title track Driving Towards The Daylight and a very very bluesy A Place In My Heart. I have played this album several times over the last few days and I would recommend it to all of the current Joe Bonamassa fans and new listeners. This one should be on everyone's buy now list.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love to play this game. its fun to play when you have time on your hands. it takes a lot of time and patience. I love it!!!!!!
B007K3JCAE|4.0|If I get another worthless ULTRAVIOLET copy!  I love the movie, but was frustrated when I saw it will come with ultraviolet.  Every UltraViolet I've had has been an issue, and if I can pay less without it, GREAT.  I'll pay for digital copy, but hate paying for UltraViolet! But I still really liked Scherlock Holms 2.

030758836X|5.0|I can't say much about Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl without revealing too much about the story. Suffice to say, Gone Girl is an amazing book. Like most books it has slow parts but the vast majority of the book is fast paced and enthralling. I highly recommend Gone Girl and Gillian Flynn's other books. I'm looking forward to reading Flynn's next book.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise. As an avid fan of Jane Austen I have found Emma to be the least liked by myself of her works . This version was a quite a find, well scripted, well acted and a pleasure to watch. If you are a Jane Austen fan, and a fan of English period drama , this is a must.
0345803507|2.0|Honestly my opinion on this book is Switzerland. I was definitely sitting in the middle as to whether I really liked it or not.<br /><br />I had so much trouble with the fact that Ana never attempted any other relationship in the book except Christian. I really wanted her to experience someone else or maybe just get away from Christian at least for more then 5 days.<br /><br />The fact that he tied her up and threatened her constantly made me feel so uncomfortable. I couldn't stand the fact that when she did her response was always a whisper or something like that. And her \\"inner goddess\\" would always be so aroused by these threats. One of the only times I felt Ana really took charge was when she told he was F***** Up and had serious problems and she walked out and left him. But that was shortly ruined by the fact that she just went back to him after her \\"Christian Withdrawel\\" became to much for her.<br /><br />It was extremely repetitive with phrases and words and a few grammatical mistakes which I found annoying. The most annoying thing was probably the amount of sex they had. I felt like half the book was just crap sex scenes that were the same everytime. With Ana saying 'Holy Cow' half the time. I found myself skipping most of the sex scenes because I got so sick of them.<br /><br />It is a good book if you are are into \\"boy gets girl. the end.\\" sort of thing and I must say, I did feel compelled to finish the book to find out what happened. And when the movie is released I was definitely be there to see it but it just wasn't my cup of tea. So i guess i'm not really Switzerland, more Germany I think...
1250000971|5.0|Have just finished \\"The Sins of the Father\\", which is truly an excellent follow up to \\"Only Time Will Tell\\". What a page turner! Taking off from the first book, the story continues to capitivate by following all of the memorable characters through unpredictable plot lines that twist and turn in every direction. I can't wait for the final book to learn how everything finally turn out.<br /><br />I agree with others who say this is not a stand alone book. Those who try to read \\"Sins.....\\" without first reading the beginning book in the trilogy, \\"Only Time...\\" will be somewhat lost trying to connect all of the characters and storylines. Besides, \\"Only Time....\\" is also a great read.<br /><br /> Jeffrey Acher has to be considered one of our all time best story tellers. Get into this series, you won't be disappointed.
0307887898|5.0|This book is a great summary of what some entrepreneurs and marketers have been saying for about the last ten years, but only a few were listening. I see this book as a milestone for the next period of time for those who want to start an Enterprise or a new product or service.

014241011X|5.0|I bought this book for my son, who is eight. I read it myself first, then gave it to him. I loved it, and so did he; he has now read it twice. Dahl is a wonderful children's author for many reasons, but one of the biggest is that he doesn't talk down to his readers. The topic may be shocking or scary or confusing (witches, e.g.), but Dahl does not pretend that there is nothing to fear. Which is why, to an eight-year-old child, a book like this is a revelation; the child is being addressed as a confidant, an equal. Also, the sheer creativity of this book is fantastic.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good fun easy game. no trouble or glitches play a while and start again and do it better again and again
1452101426|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2I2LVFGR4PFB2]](Spoiler alert! Spoiler in the video starts from 1s)<br /><br />This is a lovely art book for the movie Brave. This is number 13 for Pixar if anyone's counting.<br /><br />The book's 160 pages and it's all filled with art and commentary. The concept art is great and you can really feel that everything really fits well together, the characters, the landscape and the stories. There are character designs, environment drawings, sculpts, storyboards and colorscript.<br /><br />This is Pixar's first period film. The environment designs are a bit dark but that's because the movie is set in ancient Scotland. It's interesting to see a mythical and worn landscape as designed for animation. The colour choices are quite muted, perhaps to give more contrast to Merida.<br /><br />The characters and art are delightful to look at. They are so full of personality. They have all sorts of characteristics and shapes that make them stand out. There are a few pages of storyboard sequences that are really great, even without words you know the chemistry between the characters and how they are feeling.<br /><br />Steve Pilcher is the production designer and there's a lot of his charming drawings included. His pencil drawings really beautiful and dimensional. They really bring the characters and places to life. Other artists included are Carter Goodrich, Steve Purcell, Noah Klocek, Matt Nolte and more.<br /><br />The book doesn't really talk about the story as a whole, but the text do cover the characters and their development. So there's bits and pieces of spoilers throughout.<br /><br />Overall, it's a wonderful book put together by author Jenny Lerew. It's a good read with great art.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Pixar and animation art.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am in love with this series. Although it is a little &#34;Cinderella&#34; story for this generation, I did enjoy the books. I would recommend the series, but have had a lot of friends with teenage daughters wanting to read it. I am not a parent, and parents are free to do what they wish, but I would be skeptical on who reads the book.
030746363X|5.0|I had my second son about 3 months ago and have been looking for a way to drop the baby lbs.  With an almost 3 year old and the little guy I don't have a lot of time to mess around.  The fat-loss diet is working well for me.  It is simple and you don't have to eat a zillion times a day. It isn't super strict, and the cheat day is a key feature for me to adhere.  I can be strict all week if I get my ice cream and pancakes on Saturday!  I feel like my body is well-fueled for chasing the kiddos as well as nursing (I breastfeed my youngest exclusively)  Also, randomly, my hair, nails and skin look awesome.  I am adding some weights to my routine this week (the kettlebell swing)  This book is an interesting and entertaining read, and I am enjoying experimenting with what works for me.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|I bought this for my wife, she loves it. If you are an Adele fan this Blu-Ray concert is a no-brainer (great video, great sound). If you're not then DUH why are you considering buying it?
B007L96VCY|5.0|\\"Ram\\" may well be the greatest rock album ever to be critically dismissed. If you don't already know it, I recommend you listen for yourself and draw your own conclusions. If you know and enjoy it and wonder if it's worth getting the remastered edition of the album, it is.<br /><br />The sound difference between this version of \\"Ram\\" and the earlier one is comparable to that between the old Beatles CDs and the remastered albums. This version sounds better than the original LP of \\"Ram\\": the clarity is improved, and the range is expanded. It's now possible to hear every detail of the arrangements.<br /><br />Obviously, I love this album. Critics and fans will go on arguing over its \\"correct\\" rating and place in rock history; I'll just say that few albums that have received the kind of critical hatchet job \\"Ram\\" did on its release have gone on to win so many new listeners 40 years later. (I'm a Gen Xer who discovered this album as an adult.) My advice to anyone wondering what \\"Ram\\" is all about is to turn down the critical noise, pro and con, and just listen to it.<br /><br />For those interested, here's some history and interpretation.<br /><br />On its release in 1971, \\"Ram\\" was roundly reviled by the rock press. In Rolling Stone Jon Landau famously called it \\"the nadir in the decomposition of 60s rock so far,\\" and that pretty well set the tone for the official reviews. Paul McCartney had done something that wasn't cool in the early 1970s, especially for an ex-Beatle: he'd made an album with his wife that focused on personal emotion and experience, at a time when the former Beatles were expected to give cosmic statements. And it sounded like he was having way too much fun doing it.<br /><br />The only statement the rock press of the time picked up on was the anger directed at John Lennon in \\"Too Many People.\\" Never mind that Lennon had been slagging off McCartney publicly for a while; McCartney's referring to \\"too many people preaching practices\\" and saying \\"you took your lucky break and broke it in two\\" outraged the critics, and they kicked McCartney on Lennon's behalf.<br /><br />So they ignored the beautiful melodies, inventive arrangements, and well-crafted songs that characterize the album, and dismissed it as fluff. But if you pay attention it's clear that this is McCartney's most personal album, and the one in which he achieved the best marriage between his melodic and lyric-writing gifts.<br /><br />\\"Dear Boy\\" pairs Beach-Boys-style harmonies with a stinging dismissal of Linda McCartney's ex-husband. The musical and vocal brio of \\"3 Legs\\" and \\"Smile Away\\" display McCartney's determination to carry on despite being blamed (mostly unfairly) for the Beatles' breakup. \\"Long-Haired Lady\\" and \\"Eat at Home\\" are love songs, the latter a clear tribute to Buddy Holly. \\"Heart of the Country\\" describes escaping to a beautiful place and starting over, something McCartney was currently doing on his Scottish farm. \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey,\\" the album's big radio hit, is a mock apology that turns into a soaring release of pure melody. \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\" revisits youthful longing and lust, and culminates in a full-on vocal by McCartney that's as raw as \\"Oh! Darling.\\" And \\"Ram On\\" is a simple, heartfelt statement of what for him made life worth living in the midst of the Beatles' wreckage: finally giving his heart completely.<br /><br />\\"Ram\\" isn't perfect. \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\" sags a bit in the middle, and the music of \\"3 Legs\\" deserves better lyrics in places. And it would be great if Lennon and McCartney had managed to sort out their differences without attacking each other publicly.<br /><br />But in terms of melody and musical inventiveness, this is an amazing album, fully as great on its own terms as Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine.\\" That some critics today (in Q magazine's recent review of the remastered album, for example) are leading a backlash against the album's recognition as a classic in many quarters is sad, but not too surprising. As McCartney remarked in a later song, \\"Some people never know.\\"s is sad, but not too surprising. As McCartney remarked in a later song, \\"Some people never know.\\"

0345803485|4.0|Christien Grey definitely reminds me of Roarke from JD Robb's In Death series, except that he is younger, not Irish, and not from future America. Also, he is far more dominant that Mr. Roarke. I read that EL James was inspired by twilight for this series, and after reading I can see how only in the sense if teir love for one another. But isn't that indicative of all love stores? .  It's a quick, steamy read, sure to make any woman blush, and fulfill and secret desires. She replaces a vampirism trend with S&M fantasies. Sometimes the writing is contrived, but I felt that way mostly in the scenes where they weren't getting busy.

He's got the proof: there's no end to the ways we fake ourselves out and remain self satisfied. Not for learned researachers and marketers.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I love this stylus! I mainly purchased it because it was the only stylus that didn't have the \\"broke in 2 weeks\\" reviews. EVERY other stylus I looked at, even ones with 4 star average ratings, had at least 3 reviews which said that the stylus broke in little time. I wanted a durable stylus since they're not cheap. I really really love this stylus. I love the name, the feeling, the shape, the texture, the size, everything. It's obvious that the stylus was made from quality materials.<br /><br />I've written full page notes with this and it's like using a felt tip marker on paper, so smooth and easy to handle. It just glides over the glass on my new Ipad. I find any excuse to use it just because I really like using it, I know that sounds weird but it's true. I'm a 21 year old college girl who will use this mainly for writing notes in class but I draw for fun and the Cosmonaut is great for both. Also, I think the durability is awesome enough to be able to give to children, I really can't picture this thing falling apart at all. Watch the \\"How it's made\\" video that was on \\"Mr. Roger's Neighborhood\\", it's on the Cosmonaut website. If it's good enough for mr. Roger then it's definitely good enough for me.<br /><br />Best of all, they're MADE IN AMERICA.<br /><br />In case you're shopping for a notes app, I use notability with this stylus and really like it.<br /><br />***edited after a month of use***<br />The customer that gave a four star review must be using a sub par drawing app. At first I didn't comment on intensive use for drawing with the stylus because I hadn't really drawn anything incredibly detailed but now I have. I use sketchbook and I've been able to draw awesomely well with the Cosmonaut. I wish Amazon allowed for photo attachments so that I could show a drawing that I have finally completed after an entire day of drawing with the Cosmonaut.

0452289963|5.0|This book is not a walk in the park. I say that not because it's a trudging experience, but it demands the reader be truthful with himself--wholly. It's exceptionally well-written and Tolle shows himself knowledgeable about our spiritual dimension, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the one that counts. There's true optimism about the world's future in this book and a handle for you if you're willing to grasp. Sometimes he reaches conclusions that are a bit of a stretch, it seems, but for its impact on me personally, I give it an A+.<br /><br />Allan Cox, author of \\"WHOA!

I couldn't put them down.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|...a few minor problems.  1. The directions are a bit hard to follow...but once you solve a few puzzles you get the hang of it.  2. It is pricey. ( I'm glad I got it for the free app of the day!!)  lol. :)<br />3.  The x\\"s are a bit pf a pain.  If you hit a wrong square...having to tap it a few extra times seems pointless since an x-ed out square is basically the same as a blank square.<br />Other than that it is a great and challenging game.  Each level has a bunch of puzzles and they vary in difficulty.  Great time passer...thanks!!

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is living in the frigid Northwest Territories on a petroleum drilling and refining plant. His job is to protect the workers from the wildlife that surrounds the plant. While traveling to Anchorage via plane, the almost full aircraft encounters bad weather and temperature so cold that it finally crashes. When he wakes up he finds 7 men capable of moving and the rest are dead or dying.<br /><br />They believe that their injuries and subzero weather will kill them until the wolves arrive and they realize that they have even more serious problems......<br /><br />This movie is a good story but it is also very gruesome so be warned. Both the plane crash and the wolf attacks are bloody. The men struggle to survive and face all of the elements that nature can throw at them. The movie is well filmed and the actors do a good job portraying their roles. Liam Neeson is especially good as the group leader take charge type of guy.<br /><br />For me what detracted from the movie was that these aggressive and intelligent men could not form weapons of any major type. They leave the crashed plane and all of the supplies and potential weapons they could have made from metal to wander into the frigid artic wilderness. This movie was good but it could have been so much more if the men hadn't forgotten everything they could have done more easily.<br /><br />My wife and I still enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to you as a suspenseful story about survival. I just wish that one time you could watch a movie of this type and have some of the protagonists do more of the right things!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|It's a good game and all. Plays well, but a little touchy. Worth maybe a buck or two, not the five dollar asking price. Yes it has open sockets, but it's to share your accomplishments with others. And if you can't pass a level like 1.6 then this game is just too hard for ya.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|I do like this game, but it'd be even better if it didn't glitch out all the time.

Other than that, everything's great.

B005LAIGN2|1.0|When George Lucas said he just wanted to make \\"a corny propaganda film for black teenagers\\" you knew we were in trouble. Nice to see George thinks black teens have no cinematic taste. Casablanca and Sixty Seconds Over Tokyo were propaganda films but are memorable and entertaining. Its hard to know where to start. All of the history is watered down. We get Bryan Cranston as the token racist officer and some acts of racism by the bomber crews but the movie is in a hurry to get it out of the way in order to get to underwhelming CGI airial combat scenes. We never know any of the black pilots real names, where they are from, or even why they have decided to fight for a country that treats them as second class citizens(Terrance Howard's \\"God Allmighty\\" speech didnt do it for me, sorry). None of the material is treated with any real seriousness and it makes the war almost seem fun,war torn Italy doesnt look war torn. There is no real story, just a a few random events held together with time on the ground that moves at the speed of a glacier. The script is a joke, the dialogue by the bomber pilots is some of the most unintentionally funny I have ever heard: \\"There....goes.....our.....escort.....those....glory....hounding..................bastards!\\" Every manuever commited by one of the Tuskegee(a term that might b mentioned once in the movie)has to be accompanyed by a dumb one liner. The antogonist is a German pilot with a fencing scar trying to hard to speak in a menancing manner: \\"Die Foolish African!\\" It made me squirm seeing Dresden on one of the pilots maps with no acknowlegment from the movies of the carnage happening below, it would be appropriate to have this in today's drone warfare world. One pilot is shot down and sent to a POW camp in Poland, he then makes his way undetected across occupied Europe back to Italy intime for the ending credits! My grandfather served in a segrgated unit in WWII and this thing just made me furious. Watch the HBO movie, that one show's how educated and dedicated these guys were. I also recommend 12 O'Clock High and The Battle of Britain.

0307888908|4.0|In today's economy, it's hard to go a week without hearing about a major corporation laying off 5% of its staff. Disruptive companies are making entire industries irrelevant, and sometimes overnight. In a rapidly changing world, how can the common person ensure he has a good career? In The Start-up of You, Reid Hoffman and Ben Casanocha show us just that.<br /><br />While people may be curious about the tactics of the 'pay pal mafia' they are less glamorous than expected. Meet up for coffee with people. Make introductions. Send people in your network small gifts (such as newspaper articles and books). You don't have to have a corporate expense account to do these things. Be proactive, and overtime, the results will show. Be good to your network and your network will be good to you.<br /><br />In the internet age, networking has become massively more convenient. Making introductions is easy. Finding events is easy. So why aren't you doing them? In the book, Hoffman gives next action steps at the end of each chapter to help you gain momentum.<br /><br />Although there are no tips on building your resume or interviewing tips, the advice in the book will help any person gain confidence in their search. Our society places excessive emphasis on being productive and not having a gap between jobs. Sometimes that gap is the best thing you need. Stories like Sheryl Sandberg's help show that life sometimes wants us to stop and think.<br /><br />The constant mentions of LinkedIn may have people think the books is just a shameless plug for Hoffman's company and to get PR. It's not. LinkedIn is the most practical tool for networking today. It captures our contacts in a central location, and uses the power of the internet to make everything organized, and updated.<br /><br />Overall, investing in yourself and your network may seem like common sense. But common sense is not so common, and the Start-up of You will help you on the path of permanent career growth.

I doubt I pay any money to read the rest of this trilogy.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This is another winner from Alawar!!. The game has great graphics and interesting scenes. It can get a little frustrating with all the back and forth between locations.  Once you are well into the game, you can only get one inventory object at a time, then you must navigate through each scene several times to use the object and get another useful object.<br /><br />For example, you are in an underwater cave and need a jack to hold open the gate. You must go through at least 14 scenes to get the jack, then come back to the cave and use the jack to open the gate. Then, NOTHING!! You have to go back out and find another object - searching and searching and more searching. It's not a dealbreaker, there are arrow hints which speed up the searching considerably, but I needed to mention it. The good news is that all the inventory items work on the first try, and there were no glitches playing on first generation kindle fire.<br /><br />I have played many Alawar games, they are top notch, and some of the best available for Android. Also, there are two more games in this \\"Twisted Land\\" series. This one is the best of the three, without a doubt.

That said, I've read other types of books in the genre so I didn't have the same \\"physical response\\" as most of the other readers.  This book is like a \\"gateway drug\\" to all of the curious/vanilla people reading it.<br /><br />Overall I liked the series (would probably have loved it if it was a little \\"darker\\") and if Mr. Grey was older (experience level didn't mesh with his age) and would recommend that others read it because EVERYONE I KNOW is reading it!  The last time a series go this much attention i.e. The Hunger Games, a movie was born.  Now that would be interesting in the case of this series...

Maybe it's because I just came from reading the exquisite writing of Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series, but I doubt it.  I just have to shake my head that anyone could really enjoy this book. Stephanie Myers is a literary genius next to EL James! The story and characters are very interesting, but the writing is atrocious.  Oh my what a good book this could have been had someone else written it and made it believable.  The sex scenes are just over the top and really make me \\"roll my eyes\\".  Makes me wonder if EL James has ever had sex or an orgasm hermself.  It made me feel like a lot of stuff was looked up on Wikipedia and put in the story.<br />I read the reviews, I had to see what the hype was about, I regret it.  Save your precious time and money and skip this one. That is, if you enjoy good books and are a true reader. But if you get off on bad writing, or you don't know what bad writing is because you are a mouth breather and this will be the only book you've ever read, then by all means, knock yourself out.  But pick up a real book after and see what you've been missing.

B007XF0X6G|3.0|I really enjoyed Clash of the Titans since I am a huge fan of the original Hamlin classic. So I was very excited when this movie was announced and boy what a let down. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad movie, it just could have used some work. I mean what happened to Io, how could she just..die? Then, there's Perseus, who is played with a \\"God kill me already\\" expression by Sam Worthington. I mean there's no energy, no excitement in this sequel. Even the climactic finale doesn't really impress. Ares comes off as a spoiled, moping whiner. Over all, a solid enjoyable flick, but with a little more effort, Wrath of the Titans could have easily been a really awesome movie.

1416511946|4.0|I empathize with cutters.  The feeling of breaking one's own skin to acquire the cathartic release accompanying the sanguine surge makes sense.  There's a calm that follows the pain; as if the very puncture allowed all the internal demons to seep away.  Reading Nikki Sixx's The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star is like watching a seasoned cutter.  The reader has a front-row seat to the M&ouml;tley Cr'e bassist's continual bloodletting.  Taken from his own diary entries in 1987 while the band was on tour in support of their Girls Girls Girls album, these pages give real insight into the life of a multi-platinum artist hell-bent on both domination and destruction.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that after the huge success of the band's biography The Dirt that there really could be any fertile ground left to toil.  However, The Heroin Diaries is only partially about M&ouml;tley Cr'e.  It is additionally a tale of a lost boy fighting the dueling demons of drugs and depression, both of whom have their hooks deep set into his flesh.  The book also shows the music business in the `80s, up-and-coming acts like Guns n' Roses (and the brotherly bond between the writer and Slash is wonderful), as well as the expected hijinx of the M&ouml;tley Cr'e's infamous excesses.<br /><br />Perhaps best still, Sixx's Heroin Diaries showed me how far down depression can take the creative force, as well as made me appreciate the bassist's undervalued strength and determination.  I was especially enlightened by Sixx's diverse interest in music and books (Burroughs seemed expected; Orwell not as much).  This is a book beyond the story of the band; an impressive portrait of the artist, even as his most debased.  It is peering into the open wound and having the purgation wash over us at the close of the cover.  It might not be for the faint of heart, but Heroin Diaries is the most soul cleansing read I've had in a long time.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Using a Corsair H80 cooler and an ASUS P8Z77-V DELUXE motherboard, I was able to overclock this to a rock solid 4.8ghz and keep the temps under 75 degrees celsius at full load.<br /><br />The built in graphics is also pretty good for being integrated. I was able to play starcraft 2 an nearly maximum settings at 1680x1050 resolution with it.<br /><br />If you really want to know how the processor does when it comes to graphics, you can compare roughly to a $100 graphics card. Better than a Geforce GT 440 for sure.

It is still a fun toy and seems pretty sturdy.  I'm not sure how long the bottom bit will last.<br /><br />We got a stadium from Target and the whole family enjoyed using them.

0307279189|4.0|As I was getting into the sport of running, I was looking for something to inspire me to be able to run. I chose this book because it appeared to be a great book about the simple yet complex questions that the new runner has. This book was an enthusiastic novel solving the problems that the everyday runner faces.<br /><br />While ultra-running through the Copper Canyons of the desert with the Tarahumara tribe you will have to be sure to run like a ghost. This quote, \\"what if you could run for decades and never get injured?\\" describes the theme because in the harsh terrain of the canyons you will have to be able to run for long periods of time and be able to control yourself and not get injured. The runners in the book learn to adapt to the conditions that are present around them while they are running through the Copper Canyons. This book is a great explanation of how ordinary people will be able to train and teach themselves how to become some of the best ultra-runners.<br />Throughout the book I came across a few Spanish words that I was not sure of the meaning; one of the words was \\"Barrancas,\\" which means a steep walled ravine or a gorge. The author used this word to describe the terrain as they were running.<br /><br />While reading other reviews on this book one of the cons of this book was that the author is so meandering and full of hyperbole that it makes the book hard to follow. I agree with this statement because there are several times in the book where the author will be in the middle of a race and then he will be describing another race and the struggles that he faced in that race.<br /><br />Overall this is a great book to read and it will inspire you to get into running if you are not already a runner.<br /><br />TJHS 12th grade student

B0071XO8RA|4.0|My love for dystopian novels is rooted in my early childhood. It all started with The Boxcar Children, something about survival instinct and making do with limited resources, being creative and turning the cast-offs of society into a sanctuary really appealed to me.  I've followed the roots of dystopia in many directions, into space, under bubbles,  along dark roads, into cordoned off cities surrounded by ruins. Wool, wasn't my first trip underground but it's my favorite. There is an ease to the language that allows the reader to slip into the story and travel along the corridors and stairs with the characters.  So many times with post-apocalyptic/ dystopian/ speculative fiction there is a heavy underlying message, a lesson that's supposed to be learned, a political statement that you can't ever quite escape. I felt none of that while reading Wool, it's simply a good story, well written, strong three dimensional characters, magnificent believable detailed world building.<br /><br />Wool isn't wonderful because it's high brow,  big dictionary words and abstract theories, it's wonderful because it takes the reader someplace new,  it's wonderful because it exposes characters doing what we all do every day, surviving.

B005C7SXMS|4.0|Taking place in Wales, the story follows the life of a 15-year-old dealing with school, his first love, and the impending end of his parents' marriage. The story is listed as a 'comedy', but I felt it was much more of a drama with a comedic point of view. I enjoyed the lack of cliches that seem to plague domestic movies these days, along with the fact that the movie was laid out to simply tell a story, and not to try to teach the viewers a lesson. Well acted/directed, it's an interesting tale with reasonably rich characters, wrapped up in an enjoyable enough fashion. It's not going to make my best movies of the year list, but if you're looking to be entertained without the normal 'aftertaste' of some movies these days, I would certainly recommend it.

B0079HLDCQ|4.0|This is David Baldacci at his best - a page turning action thriller that will keep you guessing to the end. Baldacci is a master story tellers of thrillers that have more twists and turns than a fast paced game of snakes and ladders.<br /><br />Baldacci introduces us to Will Robie, a larger than life professional killer for the US Government (I wonder why we all get turned on with novels about these hypothetical hopefully non-existent super heros). Robie normally has no problem in killing bad people such as terrorists and major criminals. He plans his work meticulously and always makes  contingency plans for escape if something goes wrong.<br /><br />This time Robie is worried when  he is ordered to kill a divorced woman who doesn't seem to be a danger to anyone. He  enters her bedroom at night and finds her sharing her bed with her young son.  For the first time ever Robie finds that he cannot go through with the killing. Almost immediately a sniper in a nearby building kills both the woman and her son with a single shot.  To save his life Robie flees the scene and following his contingency plan heads for a local bus station.<br /><br />At the same time a 14 year old girl, Julie, escapes from an abusive foster home and enters her  parents home only to hear both of her drug addicted parents being murdered. The girl escapes the murder scene and catches the same bus as Robie. When someone tries to  kill Julie on the bus, Robie is there to save her life.  Just as they get off the bus together there is a huge explosion, demolishing the bus and killing all of the passengers. Robie and Julie are not seriously injured and form an alliance to keep their safety.<br /><br />The plot then changes into top gear with both Robie and Julie getting involved in helping the FBI to investigate the murders and bombing, and Robie's superiors who want to find out what went wrong.  The action is fast and furious and keeps you on edge to the very last page.<br /><br />Baldacci has built up a unenviable collection of amazing characters over the years. Now he has introduced us to Will Robie, a professional killer who finds he has a conscience. I look forward to meeting Robie in future books.a unenviable collection of amazing characters over the years.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's very good - if you like scifi, or just books with interesting stories - read this!<br /><br />I gave it four stars to balance some of the five star reviews which were putting it up with the all time best sci fi books. It is very good, but not that good - yet. I haven't read the follow up books yet, but I will be.<br /><br />My advice - don't read any reviews and just read the book as besides just being a a good book, it is refreshingly different and if you know too much about what is in the book that would take away from your reading experience.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|You might expect that the problem would be the non-actor, non-star, non-Hollywood Gina Carano. After all, the rest of the project is packed with veteran actors and a genius director.<br /><br />You would be wrong. Carano is a credible actress with charisma, sex appeal, and unusual beauty. Plus, she kicks ass. She is the only reason to watch this terrible movie.<br /><br />The plot is shopworn, the dialog trite, the direction lifeless. Even Irish and Spanish locales seem to be chosen randomly. A couple of fight scenes are okay though not inventive.<br /><br />Only Gina Carano is worth seeing. Let's hope this is not her only feature, and that next time she gets a proper showcase.

B006J420UE|4.0|400Mhz at 0.6375Vcore is now the lowest p-state I've set so far using K10stat wherein it doesn't crash while switching between p-states (up to 3000+Mhz). My whole system now consumes 55W at idle. My other system, a 1090T consumes 10W more at idle (800Mhz at 0.7250Vcore).<br /><br />Only 4 stars because the included HSF can't keep the cpu temp down to 40-45 degrees C (ambient temp is 30). I had to replace it with a larger one. Its TPD may be 100W but it heats up pretty quickly under load. I had to set the Vcore to 1.2000V so it will boot cooler into Windows. All is well after running K10stat within Windows with my custom p-states.<br /><br />Update: Memory size matters, not speed. 8GB significantly outperforms 4GB not just in benchmarks. 1600 mhz vs 1866 mhz both with tighter timings doesn't.<br /><br />Update2: I just found out the difference between 400mhz@0.6375Vcore and 3000mhz@1.2125Vcore both at full load is about 165 watts. At the default 1.4Vcore, full load would be at least 190 watts. No wonder the temp reaches 50+ degrees C with the included HSF.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|If you've played Secret of Grisly Manor and enjoyed it, then this is even better. Great graphics for this type of game.<br /><br />Gameplay involves hunting around an island, which is shown as separate screens that interconnect with each other through doorways, steps, paths etc. Along the way you find objects that help you progress, but it is not always very obvious where to use them, so you have to think about it and use some trial and error if you get stuck. Through collecting heart-shaped stones you change the scenes from spring to winter to summer to autumn, and these seasons affect what you can do (eg, do you need the water in a particular area to be frozen or not?)<br /><br />I've played it through once and I did have to rely on the help screens. Which are really bad. But it did get me through the game, so I suppose they can't be completely useless. They just could be so much more user-friendly. The map is OK, and certainly helps, but again, this could be easier.<br /><br />Oh, and if you can't actually find the help screens, they're in the journal in your sack. It took me a while to figure that out too!<br /><br />An enjoyable game, and I look forward to playing this through many more times.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I just cannot bring myself to read the third book. The author needs to purchase a thesaurus.

B004BLTNM0|3.0|This might be regarded as one of the most controversial exploitation films of all time. It is also known under a host of different titles including its original title, Day of the Woman.  Many Critics despise this film, where the director sees it as a feminist power film, many other see it as simply a rape and revenge film. It spent years banned in many countries. I personally really enjoy this movie But I'll be the first to say it is not for everyone. Its portrayal of gang rape is flat out disturbing.    One of the movies weak spots which many mainstream critics pointed out is the movie doesn't have much development for each character. Their personalities are rather simple and it heavily relies on the rape scene to build sympathy for Jennie. All of this is at least partially true as there is very little dialogue and not much time in between the rape scene and the kill scenes but for something like this there really doesn't have to be.    The movie's point is meant to be that rape is a violent and terrible crime and the people that commit deserve to be punished. One isn't meant to sit there watch this movie and say, \\"Oh those poor people how dare she kill them!\\" That would be counter productive to the point. If one wanted to be simple about it they could attribute this entire film to be an anti-rape PSA, however it is one that holds some merit. The story in of itself is a standard \\"you reap what you sow\\" premise which is a common theme for horror and exploitation films. This movie just uses an actual serious crime instead of the normal mean prank or teasing routine.    for my full review of this film please visit [...]

0307352145|5.0|I picked this book up and could not put it down. As a lifelong introvert, I was interested to finally find a defense of the thinker. Ms. Cain also makes the important distinction that introverted does not mean shy or socially awkward.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the review of high-reactive vs. low-reactive traits. As someone who hates loud noises, bright lights, and people babbling, I found myself nodding in agreement.<br /><br />If you're the type who values quiet, me-time, and ideas over the mindless noise that permeates our society, do yourself a favor and read this book.

0393338827|5.0|I like everything by Michael Lewis I have read, and his books are readable enough that they have been picked up for movies (OK, maybe that's not the best recommendation). Rather, they are readable and understandable to someone not a wonk on the subject, or genius.  He can take something like football, and make it appeal to someone like myself, who has just a passable knowledge of the game (\\"The Blind Side\\" - and, yes, there is *much* more to that book than you can get from the movie.  \\"Moneyball\\" is another of his; who would have guessed that baseball stats could be so interesting?)<br /><br />With this book, he's able to take something like the financial meltdown, that is difficult to wrap one's mind around (what *is* a hedge fund, anyway?) and make it somewhat understandable, with personal stories along the way.<br /><br />Anything by Michael Lewis is, for me, a must-read, and this is one of his best.  Granted, this book has been out for a while, but if you missed it, get it!

Then my mom comes and brings the darkest hour 3D. we put it inside his panasonic 3D bluray player, popped on our glasses and watched. I have to say this movie was excellent, everything from the refresh rates, to 3D, and audio. It was a truly amazing experience. They have a 5.1 surround sound and i am telling you things sounded great. The 3D was very nicely done.

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This is one of those rare albums that, in this day and age, have several songs that are appealing.  Bruno Mars has a wonderful voice.  You could just download the songs that you have heard on the radio, but this one is worth the money.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I ordered these a couple days ago and so far they are amazing! I ordered these because my freinds and I wanted to keep in touch over the summer though video games and skype. These work perfectly for both. First thing I did after taking these out of the box was to listen to a song to see how it compaired with my other headphones and I was very suprised at the quality of these! The bass was nice and they sounded really good. The mic is very high quality also. I tested it on the skype echo sound test sevice and it had no echo and it sounded very clear. The headset is very comfortable and works fine with my glasses. So far I the only con I can see is that the cord may be too short for some users. Great buy and highly suggest it.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This movie rocked!!!  I almost didnt rent it because of some of the low reviews but Im so glad I ended up renting it.  It is well worth the 4 bucks to rent!!  You must watch!!!
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Yes, we all thought \\"are they serious?\\" but it actually makes for a fun to watch movie.  The cheese is still there at times, but it's done well.
0143038583|5.0|Borrowed this book initially from the library, but it shortly became a 'must-own'. Michael Pollan's investigation into the food we eat and how it arrives at the supermarket is keenly insightful.  He introduces the reader to the way we *should* be farming, raising animals for food (hence the title), and eating.  His visit to Polyface Farms was an eye-opener, and once you read that, you will be (figuratively) smacking your head, saying, why on earth isn't every farmer doing this? (The answer isn't simple, but has a lot to do with government intervention.)<br /><br />Prior to reading this, my interest in farming was virtually non-existent, and I live smack in the middle of corn-and-soybean country. That's how interesting and essential this book is!<br /><br />As I stated in the title, this book should be required reading for *everyone*, but especially those who are involved in making policy with regard to agriculture. We can only hope things will change!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK ENOUGH.  WORDS DO NOT DO JUSTICE TO ALL THE INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN BY READING IT. THIS BOOK IS AN EYE OPENER AND SO INSPIRATIONAL. A MUST READ!
B001BPJJ1E|4.0|I was a senior in high school in 1971 and on vacation in London with my mother. We were having a theatre tour taking in every show we could. We had a spot (a matinee) on our schedule that was empty. I loved OLIVER! and its stars and we decided on this film still in its first run. I was enchanted. My mother was, also. The characters were kids I knew (maybe even kids I had been at that time in my life!) It is a movie that anyone who has been in love, but especially those who fell in love when they were younger, will identify with. It is not a perfect movie. But it still works. It is too bad that there hasn't been a major re-release with a quality video format for the US and Canada. The print available is scratchy and of poor quality. This is a delightful movie.

B00110K62U|5.0|I bought this as a gift, after viewing it with my bff (for whom I bought it).  It's fun, captivating, hilarious and heartbreaking. For a middling fan of musicals such as myself, that's saying a lot.  You'll find yourself singing along, or with the songs stuck in your head (and then you'll want the music CD as well)!
B0078YWDHO|1.0|This movie was very terrible.  We turned it off after about 5 min.  We were so disapointed with Johnny Depp.  Please don't spend your money on renting this movvie.

B00845MRKE|5.0|This is the greatest scifi movie of all time, even beating out star wars, Ridley Scotts greatest cinematic achievement. I'm just glad that over the years, this movie slowly gain the recognition that it so rightfully deserved
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not one to write a bad review... First I respect anyone who can put pen to paper because I know how hard it is to write a book...<br /><br />I detested Christian from the beginning to the end...<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey had some redeeming erotic scenes but did not do it for me...<br /><br />The ending left my eyes reaming in anger...<br /><br />Will I read book 2 and book 3... Not a chance.
1451627289|5.0|A story that begins as one sort of tale, and evolves into something else entirely. I found the premise interesting, if not a little outside of my normal reading habits, but given my respect for Stephen King, I gave the book a chance. Certainly, I am pleased that I did.<br /><br />At the beginning it seems like a tale from the twilight zone, wrapped in a shroud of bizarre mystery and science fiction. As the story soldiers on, you soon begin to forget about some of these strange aspects of this and instead find yourself immersed in the new world laid before you- the difference in culture, people, and the time. Like the character, you find yourself torn between following the initial plot (or in his case, his task) or giving yourself totally to the wonderful story about one man removed from time, forming bonds with others he was never destined to meet.<br /><br />Naturally, the story has its twists and turns, and as the character always puts it- the past is obdurate. You will find yourself rooting for him in his quest to carve out a new life for himself, falling in love with all the people he meets just as does he, and in the end, I dare you not to cry.<br /><br />Great read, among one of my absolute favorites.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|there is only a couple songs that I like on this cd.  I was really disappointed once I received it.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I hated social media or so I thought until I read Likeable Social Media. The title alone got my attention but the contents were outstanding. I'm a convert due to Likeable's take on what this media is really all about, relationship, authentiticity, transparency, all of which are values I cherish so I got over myself after reading his valuable insights and plan on using his many recommendations by putting them into practice in my business, thanks, well worth the time to read!
B001QVFDA4|4.0|I love Guy Ritchie films. Doesn't matter who's in them, when they were done, or how outrageous the story line.<br />Rock'N Rolla was the first Guy Ritchie film I'd seen since the Sherlock movies, and I was taken to a happy place. It reminded me a lot of \\"Snatch\\", and some about \\"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\". The storyline has many points of entry, there are several examples of \\"I know a guy who knows someone's cousin who used to know this person that does things like this- I got connections\\". Classic Ritchie, and just classic. Loved this movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sexy, raunchy, and delicious. I couldn't put it down.  Very well written (at first I was a little unsure), this book had me engrossed in everyway possible. Can't wait to read the other 2 books!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Well written with decent characters but seriously there are way to many problems for this to be rated anything beyond a generous 3 stars. I will try to avoid spoilers but apparently in this dystopian world, people forgot how to use their brain.. at all. How many times would it take to go up and down stairs until somebody would go 'hey you know what? A lift would be good.' Or lets launch an major attack without any recon, basic intel or plan besides marching up a hundred flights of stairs and going through the front door. My biggest issue is how \\"order\\" is paramount but if this \\"order\\" leads to a bloody uprising every generation then don't you think people in charge might go 'what a minute?'
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like the variety of different games every time you play. it is very addicting and sometimes intense but always fun.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|My husband and I found this movie to be boring and extremely depressing. The sad (and often pathetic) circumstances throughout this movie are not really all that heartfelt, do not really make much of a point, and are overly repetitious. Clooney's wife is in a coma, His daughters are unruly (the youngest wants to watch porn!?), and he spends the majority of the movie chasing after the man his wife had an affair with so that he can release his anger on him, and then invite him to see his wife before her passing. He and his eldest daughter both yell psychotically at the comatose wife, which seems senseless considering the circumstances. The eldest daughter's boyfriend is criticized throughout the movie by Clooney's character and the father-in-law though it is clear that he is not portrayed to be a lesser-than figure. The behavior and responses by characters in the movie are childish, and for the most part, unnecessary. The large chunk of Hawaiian land inherited from ancestors, which Clooney's character considers selling, is only a backdrop in the movie which isn't really referenced all that much. Not that it would have been more interesting otherwise, but the title doesn't really fit. The movie is much more focused on behavioral and situational issues such as to what I've already mentioned. Boring.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|This will amplify the sound of what you are trying to hear. The white noise becomes so intense that everything you hear is just muffled. This product is not worth the money. I could hear much better without the use of this product.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I have been trying Dr. Davis' wheat free diet plan for a week and have noticed very promising results from cutting out all the wheat products I have been eating for years. I haven't had any withdrawal symptons although I'm still trying to work out substitutes for my cereal/toast breakfast, muffin for morning tea and sandwich for lunch followed a pasta dinner 3-4 times a week. My favourite biscuits and cake ... I think you get the picture!<br /><br />The main benefits I have found after one week:<br /><br />The cramping pain under my ribs on my left side that I have been having for the last 10 years have just about gone, just an occasional twinge now.<br /><br />An itchy rash on the skin on my upper arm that had defied all topical creams given by doctors for many years is clearing up well and is nearly gone.<br /><br />The vague feelings of nobody loves me, everybody hates me weird thoughts I was having are also going.<br /><br />My appetite is starting to self regulate and I'm no longer looking for a wheat/sugar fix after a couple of hours. I went without lunch yesterday after a 2 egg omlette with parmesan cheese and parsley for breakfast. In the evening I didn't feel that hungry but did have some fresh fish with a pepper, tomato and onion vegetable side dish for dinner followed by some raw nuts a couple of hours later for dessert. I'm going to make some apple walnut bread and some muffins from the recipes in the book and I'm really looking forward to making the pizza.<br /><br />Constipation also seems to be a thing of the past, without the high fibre multi grain cereal and bread I was eating. Eating more vegetables and more healthy oils and nuts are certainly fixing the gas and bloating I was experiencing previously and all this just after one week! I can hardly believe how much better I am feeling in body and mind and I am looking to feeling even better in the next few months and hopefully get rid of this wheat belly that has been getting bigger and bigger in thelast few years.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Davis, I'm looking forward to my wheat free existance and continued improvement in my health.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|This product was not what I expected but it does work as far as \\"protecting\\" the device from outside object scratches... I don't think it would help with a drop because the actual screen cover flap is to lightweight and will not absorb shock from impact ... It however works wonderfully as a stand for movie viewing and even gaming :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Works well on Galaxy Nexus and Xoom. While on the phone can be a bit cumbersome to scroll back and forth on the phone, the game is still enjoyable.<br /><br />Easy to understand instructions and performs flawlessly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book picks up right where book one ends, only this one is even better.  I laughed out loud, I cried, I even found myself holding my breath at times.  I never read romance novels of any kind, but all the hype about these books forced me to give them a try and I'm glad I did.  Christian Grey is a damaged, fragile man that cried out to my heart.<br /><br />I am about to begin book three with some sadness as I do not won't this story to end.  I am crazy about the characters.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about this book, keep an open mind and give it a try.  It's unlike anything I've ever read.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Unfortunately after downloading this game ... It has never been opened ... Meaning it can not load or actually open on my kindle... but it does have nice graphics as it is trying to open
B007YJS7G4|4.0|Action flick more than anything. Lots of aerial combat, special effects and all done well except now and again, faint hint of computer graphics but did not ruin action. Found perhaps a little too long and predictable plot and surprisingly, very little about Negro aviators. Oh, that aspect in film but to extent that it moved me or made me angry how we treated Negro in the day and still do, no, movie did not move me BUT as I said up front, action movie and a good one for that. Recommend when action is all you want.
0385342039|5.0|Wonderful, fun, light and hilarious!<br />This was my first book from Sophie Kinsella, and right after I finished it bought the Can You Keep a Secret book. Her books are just fun to read, I had a great time reading it, laughed at basically every page.<br />The reason why I picked this book was because I had just read other Novels of mysteries and murders and just all around craziness (Don't get me wrong it was pretty good) but I needed something light, something to read and have fun with, and I can tell you this book did just that!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book!
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|Interesting film with decent enough plot, characters, action, dialogue, effects. Lots of people have never heard of this film but it is worth a look if you like SYFY and or action. Riddick as the main character, sort of, is an interesting character, who you are not sure you like or hate. Recommend. Actually like this one better than \\"follow on\\" Chronicles of Riddick.
1401233791|5.0|Batman Knightfall is one of those arcs I had yet to read and was very pleased to hear DC had reprinted the series. The premise is essentially Batman against Arkham Asylum inmates all released as part of Banes master scheme. From then on out it is very entertaining to see how batman must face more than one familiar villain in a short amount of time before reaching Bane. This quickly became one of my favorite batman stories to date and I highly recommend it. The only flaw lies with the book itself as a few have stated the paper quality is not great, but for 600 pages and the price its seems fair.
044024630X|3.0|I was looking forward to reading The Affair and after several starts finally managed to finish it. I was looking forward to finding out more about Jack Reacher--his background, motivations and what made him the loner he is. While we do find out more about Reacher and his family and what motivates him--Lee Child basically wrote a book that could be inserted almost anywhere in the series. The Jack Reacher of The Affair is the Jack Reacher of the last book of the series.<br /><br />Book 16 takes Reacher back to 1997 when he was an elite military cop who goes to Carter Crossing, Mississippi to look into a murder that points to a soldier with friends in high places. Reacher hooks up with local sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux and guides her through the process to solve the mystery.<br /><br />I guess this book for me at least lacked the heart and soul of Jack Reacher. Reacher seemed more like a rehashed cardboard character in this prequel to who he becomes in the first fifteen books. He still is Reacher, but from something I read I guess I thought this particular book would have more depth and more background than a sentence or paragraph thrown in here and there.<br /><br />Not a bad book, but not Child's best.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just a fun read.  Romantic, erotic and actually has a somewhat obscure plot. I have read all 3 books and enjoyed each one. If you're looking for a spicy, unbelievable read this is the series.
B0015DROBO|3.0|After getting bogged down in the first chapter and putting this book aside, I came back to it later, and was glad I did.  The story is engaging and the characters are engaging.  But there's flaws.  Warning: moderate spoiler mode from here on....<br /><br />First one thing I liked: all the goodies used Macintoshes.  The baddies were all on Windows machines....<br /><br />But more seriously: a strong source of evidence is described in the opening of the book, then that evidence is ignored.  This is inexplicable from a story standpoint.  The only explanation is the author added it after the rest of the book was completed, because otherwise no reader would survive chapter 1.  A major component of a mystery is the reader's engagement, trying to solve the case from the information provided.  In this case, the \\"obvious\\" explanation based on the opening scene never gets attention until the very end.<br /><br />Another issue: the end game of the book seriously stretches the bounds of plausibility, with Salander's abilities seemingly limitless.  When characters turn to have limitless powers, it begs the question of why these weren't used earlier in the story.  Clearly the entire book could have been wrapped up much earlier if her skills are as described.<br /><br />But another factor: the Mikael's incredible promiscuity hardly makes him a compelling character.  I had been warned that he comes off as a bit of a self-absorbed jerk, and I reached the same conclusion.  Of course characters without flaws don't make good stories, and to Larsson's credit Mikael's behavior causes issues late in the book.<br /><br />I can't give it less than 3 stars because it was a good read.  But certainly doesn't rank among the most memorable mysteries or thrillers I've read.

1444722921|4.0|**SPOILER ALERT: Certain elements not revealed in the review of the first book, Delirium, may be revealed here.**<br /><br />Book two in the Delirium series starts with Lena awakening to a new world. Her life in Portland is over, Alex is gone, and her new family are those she used to know only as the Invalids. She may have escaped her oppressors, but what has she jumped into? Life is hard. Those who live in the free zone (Portlanders call it The Wilds) must rely on the sympathizers on the other side of the fence to send them supplies when they can and make do when they can't. Winter is coming, but as the inhabitants prepare for their yearly trek south, they are attacked by the Cureds with strikes from the air. Many do not make it out alive.<br /><br />The story alternates between Lena's arrival in the free zone and her work with the resistance in New York City. In New York, she poses as a cured girl living with her sister (Raven) and her sister's husband (Tack). Unbeknownst to Lena, Raven, Tack and a shadowy group called the Scavengers are planning a disruption of an enormous rally put on by the DFA (Deliria-Free America). The DFA believes that everyone, no matter what their age, needs to get the cure procedure, even though it is not safe for those under 18. Thomas Fineman, the founder of the DFA, and his son, Julian, are scheduled to speak at the rally. Through a series of events, Julian and Lena are captured and held by the Scavengers beneath the streets in the old subway tunnels. Julian thinks Lena is cured and Lena hates Julian and all he stands for. How can they build enough trust between them to be able to escape?<br /><br />Escape they must, and as they find their way back to the \\"real\\" world, Lena learns why Julian vehemently wants the cure, even though it most likely will kill him. Julian and Lena slowly form an alliance of sorts which slowly turns into something more. Once they return aboveground, Lena learns that perhaps the differences among the Resistance, the Scavengers and the those who still believe in the Cure aren't quite so black and white as she once thought.<br /><br />Many sophomore books, even those in a series, can suffer from a lack of excitement because the story has been told; it now has to be topped. Unless the author can inject something new (yet related) into the novel, Book #2 can merely serve as a conduit for information. All it accomplishes is furthering the story. Then, the last book swoops in, has an explosion or two, then wraps the tale up in a shiny bow. No fair to Numero Dos. Happy to say, this is not the case here. Because the protagonist is now in a completely different setting with a new cast of characters, her reactions and beliefs and the way she lives have changed drastically. The author takes great advantage of this by almost creating a story within a story. With a few minor changes, this book could stand on its own.<br /><br />Loved both books; can't wait until Spring 2013 for the final book, Requiem. \\"There is no before.

B001NPDCFQ|5.0|MGM musicals don't come more tuneful, entertaining and downright inspiring than MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, one of the all-time greats that Warner Home Video has released on Blu-Ray in a Digibook package offering a gorgeous 1080p transfer.<br /><br />Vincente Minnelli directed this original screen musical (later adapted to the stage in the late `80s) based on the autobiographical \\"5135 Kensington\\" New Yorker stories of Sally Benson. One of the many wonderful things about the musical is how it manages to capture the ordinary, everyday life of a St. Louis family (Judy Garland and young Margaret O'Brien as the children of middle-class parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor) circa the World's Fair in 1904, its generational relationships and the passage of the seasons - from summer-time to Halloween - while still dressing the story up in a typical, shimmering MGM production. The three-strip Technicolor cinematography shined as one of the prime examples of the format at the time of its release, and the original songs by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blaine remain delightful, from \\"The Boy Next Door\\" and \\"You and I\\" to all-time classics like \\"The Trolley Song\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\"<br /><br />With an appealing story, some wonderful performances particularly from Garland, and a classic score, \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" has always been regarded by musical buffs as one of the finest of the genre, and Warner's BD does not disappoint. Reportedly culled from a restoration made several years ago, the 1080p transfer here is dazzling and heightened by fine grain, while the 5.0 DTS MA soundtrack is effective in rechanneling the music for stereo. Ample extras in the hardbound book include an introduction from Liza Minnell; commentary from Margaret O'Brien, Hugh Martin, writers Irving Brecher and Barbara Freed-Saltzman, and Garland historian John Fricke; the Lux Radio Theater broadcast; and a music-only audio track. Unquestionably recommended!
B007CKNX28|5.0|He's just amazing, not only does he have his own style and lyrical genius. I can distinctly hear what has influenced him as well! It makes me just love this album so much. He's so eclectic it's jaw dropping. I just finished a 5 hour car trip and this was in for about 3 of the 5 hours! Excellent Excellent album. So glad I got it.
B003CRM6QO|4.0|Following the release of \\"Star Wars,\\" everyone and anyone rushed to jump in on the sci-fi craze of the late `70s -- from a rash of Italian clones to James Bond himself, the genre became saturated with space operas set in galaxies far, far away, even if most failed to resemble George Lucas' original classic in tone or execution.<br /><br />Of course, Lucas himself was influenced by a myriad of sources, including the old-time serials of the 1930s and `40s. It stood to reason that someone would rush out and gobble up the rights for characters like Flash Gordon, relaunching the original hero as a modern day product ripe for audiences still hungry for anything space-related.<br /><br />In this case, it was Dino DeLaurentiis who snapped up the option to bring Alex Raymond's comic-strip (and later Saturday matinee) hero to the screen, resulting in a 1980 film of FLASH GORDON that seemed to please camp aficionados more than general audiences, who turned the film into a box-office disappointment at the time of its release.<br /><br />The film actually follows the plot of Raymond's strip and the original Buster Crabbe serials faithfully, chronicling the adventures of Flash (ex-athlete Sam J. Jones), Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) and scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol) after they crash on the planet Mongo, controlled by the vile Ming the Merciless (Max von Sydow), who's about to unleash his plan to conquer the Earth...and the whole galaxy for that matter. On Mongo, Flash meets a variety of colorful allies, from the dashing Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton) to sensuous Princess Aura (Ornella Muti) and the high-flying Hawk Men, including their leader, Prince Vultan (Brian Blessed). Together they attempt to thwart Ming's nefarious plans as Mongo inches closer to Earth.<br /><br />No doubt there are some major problems with the movie: leads Jones (a former football player who fills the role of Flash with minimal success) and Anderson are plastic; writer Lorenzo Semple's script is light on dramatics and seemingly more concerned with camp humor and innuendo; and the much-lauded (if somewhat inappropriate) contribution of Queen to the soundtrack actually results in just a memorable, opening blast of rock over the main titles, since it's mostly Howard Blake's orchestral score that carries much of the film.<br /><br />In terms of character development and dramatic interest, \\"Flash Gordon\\" has never been entirely satisfying, but when taken as sheer eye candy with a liberal amount of laughs, you can at least see why the film remains a cult favorite. Danilo Donati's sets and costumes are simply eye-popping, packing each frame with color and fascinating artistic design. At the same time, Gil Taylor (then fresh off \\"Star Wars\\") captures the action in comic book styled cinematography that's perfect for the material, while director Mike Hodges makes up for the bland lead casting with supporting performances -- especially von Sydow, Blessed and Dalton -- that are delightfully energetic.<br /><br />\\"Flash Gordon\\" hits Blu-Ray in a spectacular VC-1 encoded transfer, capturing all the colors and details of the expensive production. Universal never released the picture on HD-DVD, so this first-ever domestic high-def edition of the film is nothing short of gorgeous, exhibiting only a tiny bit of sharpness here and there. Overall, though, not only does this \\"Flash\\" HD transfer bring the home viewer closer to the theatrical experience than any prior release, it's also an appreciable enhancement on the European Blu-Ray Studio Canal has released overseas -- a transfer that suffers by comparison with weaker colors and artificially pumped-up brightness. The DTS Master Audio soundtrack, meanwhile, boasts a satisfying, intermittently rollicking mix with deep bass.<br /><br />On the supplemental side, Universal carries over the extras from their \\"Savior of the Universe\\" 2007 DVD, including an interview with writer Lorenzo Semple, who discusses the problems inherent with writingfor DeLaurentiis (he memorably describes the producer asking him to write the script...going off, handing it in, and then having it shot with no changes made!). There's also an interview with comic artist Alex Ross plus the original trailer and the first episode of the original 1936 Buster Crabbe serial, which as I mentioned previously is strikingly similar to the 1980 film.<br /><br />It all makes for a strong Blu-Ray release, though fans should note that the European releases have some superior extras, including a very interesting Mike Hodges commentary and interview (the British DVD also sported a commentary from Brain Blessed, and is due out on Blu-Ray later this month).
0345803507|2.0|Ms. James: Please admit that this trilogy was a joke.  I don't want to believe that you really think Christian Grey is a romantic hero worthy of the blushing and stuttering and simpering of every female who crosses his path.  This man has the grace and manners of a toddler.  He throws tantrums.  He's disrespectful, insecure, and needy.  During every interaction, he scowls, smirks, glowers, and snorts, whether with his doormat of a wife, his unbelievably tolerant family, his subservient employees, or starstruck strangers.  He was a self-made billionaire by the ripe old age of 26, and yet, we see no evidence of the work ethic that would make this possible.  Between constant sex, lots of vacations, and stalking Ana around the country, it's a wonder that he has two nickels to rub together, let alone managed to build an empire.<br /><br />But enough complaining, because there were many laugh-inducing moments in this book.  We've got the two main characters who have all kinds of sex, but they still regularly blush, flush, and smile shyly in each other's presence.  There's a villain (one of several, by the way) who does every dastardly deed short of twirling his mustache and cackling.  There was a crazy and wholly unnecessary car chase to kick things off.  There was a serious car crash ending up with a secondary character in ICU that had absolutely no connection to the aforementioned car chase.  Best of all was a non-doctor character shouting, \\"Code blue!\\", which had absolutely no connection to the ICU scene which had absolutely no connection to the unnecessary car chase.<br /><br />The most shocking part of this trilogy's success is that the movie rights just sold for $4 million. I will be very interested to see how these books could be turned into a successful movie franchise. I don't envy the screenwriter who, no doubt, will need to rewrite every word of awful, cringe-worthy dialogue.<br /><br />Laters, baby.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|The subject of countless articles over its stratospheric budget and poor advertising campaign, Disney's JOHN CARTER is poised to generate new fans when the much-ballyhooed picture hits video. In fact, not only is director Andrew Stanton's fantasy a great deal of fun, but it's one central performance shy of being truly spectacular.<br /><br />Adapting Edgar Rice Borroughs' \\"A Princess of Mars\\" alongside writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon, Stanton - a Pixar animator here making his live-action directorial debut - does a fine job working familiar genre conventions into an exciting, occasionally enthralling, otherworldly adventure.<br /><br />John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a former Confederate soldier improbably whisked away to Mars, aka Barsoom, where a civil war rages between the kingdoms of Helium and Zodanga. Complicating matters further is a mysterious, and powerful, beam of energy that the lovely red Martian princess Deja Thoris (Lynn Collins) is close to unlocking the full potential of; in order to stop her, the evil Therns - puppetmasters of the planet - have decided to install one of their minions as King by having him marry Deja. It's up to Carter to stop them, and also navigate the alien wilds of a planet populated with odd creatures, including the insect-like, green Martian \\"Tharks,\\" who ultimately aid our hero in his quest.<br /><br />Packed with smashing action sequences and likeable characters (as well as a plot that's perhaps a bit too convoluted for its own good), \\"John Carter\\" is one of those films that its studio, for whatever reason, simply didn't seem to understand. Marketed as an \\"edgy\\" type of genre vehicle (with anachronistic rock music used in its trailers), the picture is really an old-fashioned, classically constructed fantasy in the obvious vein of, among other influences, \\"Star Wars\\" (with a dash of \\"Dune\\" rearing itself, notably in an unused opening to the film where the Princess, staring into the camera, introduces her alien world tothe viewer). There are faithful sidekicks (the delightful, canine-like \\"Woola\\"), unlikely allies (the Thark leader, voiced by Willem Dafoe, among them), a good amount of humor and impressive special effects to match.<br /><br />Perhaps Disney took a clue from the movie's central performance in their marketing - the picture's glaring weak point. Kitsch looks like he attended the \\"Christian Bale School of Batman Acting\\" here, delivering his lines in a hushed, monotone voice and offering not an ounce of charisma in a part that could've been a star-making performance for countless other young actors. Rarely ever cracking a smile, Kitsch's Carter is brooding to the point where you have a hard time understanding what the princess (a lovely performance from Collins) actually sees in him. It's an epic miscalculation that leaves the film with a black hole at its center, and leads one to also wonder why Disney has had such a hard time finding male leads to anchor its recent franchises (the similarly bland Garrett Hedlund was only slightly more effective in \\"Tron: Legacy\\").<br /><br />Despite Kitsch, \\"John Carter\\" is still an entertaining cinematic journey of the Saturday matinee variety, anchored by Michael Giacchino's most satisfying score to date and a particularly awesome use of 3-D.<br /><br />Although the film was converted to 3-D in post-production, the movie simply looks amazing in Disney's 3-D Blu-Ray package: depth of field effects are evident in nearly every scene, with crisp detail and almost no ghosting whatsoever that I noticed. The movie manages to maintain its bright visual pallet and come across as demo-worthy material, making the fact that it wasn't actually shot in 3-D a revelation.<br /><br />The package also includes a regular Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copy. Special features include a half-hour look behind the scenes, a brief profile of Borroughs' writing, a commentary with Stanton and fellow crew personnel, bloopers, an optional \\"Second Screen\\" interactivefunction, and a number of deleted scenes.<br /><br />I'm not sure \\"John Carter\\" is ever going to be looked at as a classic, but it certainly doesn't deserve the bad reputation it's been saddled with. Once viewers get a chance to actually see the film and not just base their views based on its negative publicity, it's likely to entertain sci-fi fantasy fans of all ages.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|With most CDs I buy, I do an initial run through the tracks, listening to some - usually not all - of each before going back to listen to the two or three I actually like, which I then transfer to my Favorites list on my iPod. With Trespassing, my usual pattern was up-ended, because I could not stop listening to ANY of the tracks. I listened to the CD straight through and then again and then again and it basically has not stopped playing in my CD player or on my iPod ever since. I've moved almost all of the songs to my Favorites list. This CD is THAT good. There simply are no must-skip tracks, no filler tracks that leave you bored. With many CDs by solo artists, the sound of a singer's voice can get repetitive, making it hard to listen to the whole thing at once. Somehow, Adam manages to avoid this, probably because he has so many ways to use that marvelous voice of his, from achingly poignant ballads (\\"Outlaws of Love\\") to funky jams (\\"Shady\\") to fun, can't-sit-still-while-listening dance numbers (\\"Cuckoo,\\" \\"Pop That Lock\\"). Even songs I didn't love at first listen -- \\"Kickin' In\\" and \\"Naked Love\\" -- have grown on me enormously; now they are among my favorites.<br /><br />As others have said, the album splits in two, with the faster-paced dance numbers up front, including the rousing \\"Trespassing,\\" a fun song with a serious message that gives a taste of Adam's glorious rock wail and teases with the promise of how he will sound rocking to \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" when he takes the stage with Queen this summer. Another favorite: new single \\"Never Close Our Eyes,\\" a poignant, seize-the-day throbber. Song eight (\\"Better Than I Know Myself\\") begins the transition to ballads and mid-tempo rockers; it is my least favorite track on the CD, yet still listenable. Stirring ballad \\"Underneath\\" is a vocal tour-de-force, a goosebump-inducing song about revealing yourself, sins and all, to your lover. \\"Chokehold\\" is a mid-tempo rocker with an earworm of a chorus; another of my faves. The deluxe edition has three bonus tracks that are bonus for a reason: they don't quite fit the sound of the first 12, but they're nice extras to have. \\"Runnin'\\" has become a fan favorite, with a deep-key beginning and higher finish; not my favorite, but I still like it. The closer, \\"Nirvana,\\" is lush and beautiful: love it.<br /><br />In short - if you're looking for shake-your-ass FUN dance music, pick up Trespassing. If you want soulful funky neo-Prince jams, pick up Trespassing. If you want to swoon along with sweet, sad, tender vocals from one of the best singers on the planet, pick up Trespassing. No matter what mood you are in, you'll find a musical match on this peerless CD, which quite deservedly took the No. 1 spot in the Billboard 200 in its debut week. Buy it. You won't regret it.
B004EPYZZI|4.0|Teenage surfer Bethany Hamilton's real-life rise from national champion to shark attack victim and back again is chronicled in this terrific spring sleeper which generated over $40 million at the box-office -- not bad at all for an independently produced \\"faith-based\\" film that's accessible for all audiences and age groups.<br /><br />Annasophia Robb is thoroughly appealing as the Hawaiian surfer girl whose determination to get back on the water after she loses her left arm makes for an inspiring drama that never becomes overly saccharine. Hamilton's faith is obviously worn on her sleeve, but there's no preachy stretches or anything that feels out of place, with director Sean McNamara handling both the movie's land-based domestic drama and surfing sequences effectively. Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid are superb as Hamilton's understanding parents; John R. Leonetti's cinematography captures the beautiful Hawaiian locales splendidly; and Marco Beltrami's lovely, gorgeous score is not only one of his best, but easily one of the best scores of 2011.<br /><br />Sony's Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack includes a just perfect AVC encoded 1080p transfer of the film with active DTS MA audio. Extras include deleted scenes, featurettes, an interview with Hamilton and the earlier half-hour documentary \\"Heart of a Soul Surfer,\\" which recounts Hamilton's accident. A standard DVD edition is also included in the combo package.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wonder if it is possible to go back and through this trilogy and count how many times the \\"F\\" bomb could be dropped.<br /><br />Additionally, while the story line was ok, I think the author sure spent way too much time detailing out EVERY SINGLE FREAKING time they had sex.  Same ole same ole- snore.<br /><br />I actually finished this book probably a week early as I was able to fast forward through 60% of the sex content which was about 2/3rds of the books.<br /><br />Overall I liked the characters- 50 Shades was good- but really hate how 50 Freed ended.  I need to find something new fast to get over it.  :(
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. And I still have to read the rest of the series. Then I will read the next Percy Jackson series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I can plug my phone into my car and have the Bible read to me in any version while I travel!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I am waiting for a some books to be released from a few series that I have been following.  Meanwhile, I wanted something that has good character development, some magic and a touch of romance.  I purchased the book based on the reviews and I'm glad I did.  The romance is definitely there and so is the sex which I didn't expect to be described in so much details.  But it didn't feel forced or out of place.  It was believable and lend to the story.  The writing is superb with little details here and there that put you right at the scene.  In addition to the two main characters, I love Gurn and even Cael.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Streep does what she can with this turkey, but it is ridiculous to me that most of this movie seems to portray Thatcher suffering from dementia, with often out of context, unrelated, confusing flashbacks to parts of her career. This was a woman who, if a film was to be made of her, deserved to have her astounding accomplishments displayed in a coherent fashion, rather than this crazy quilt/broken mirror set of glimpses around a framework of a doddering aged dementia.<br /><br />Maybe it is worth a rental, but not a purchase
B004GAY2GS|5.0|This 2011 release benefits greatly from the advances in CD mastering of recent years.  Although \\"Walk Into Light\\" has been on compact disc several times, this would seem to be the one to have.  EMI's technicians can be praised for their work here.<br /><br />This first Ian Anderson solo album appeared in 1983, when he was in his mid-thirties, and arguably at a creative peak.  Jethro Tull had released \\"The Broadsword and the Beast\\"--one of their better albums, in my view--the previous year and, although the band's label packaged it as a single LP, Ian had written music enough  for two records.  (It took the compact disc and its extended playing time to gather together the fruits of this creative burst on the part of Ian Anderson.)  \\"Broadsword\\" made rather extensive use of electronic and synthesized sounds, not unusual for the early Eighties, and Ian continued this line of thought for his solo recording.<br /><br />The differences between this disc and previous CD releases of the same music can be heard from the very first track on the album.  There is a smoothness to the sound, a natural quality.  An earlier version I owned, produced in Russia  (the only one in print at the time I acquired it), certainly had  clear sonics, but some of the synthesized instruments sounded icy or brittle to me, the synth drums disagreeably boomy.  I had wondered why I could not seem to listen to more than a couple of tracks on that disc without fatigue.  The answer was found in this new one, on which synthesizers sound like musical instruments, and not like arcade games.<br /><br />Thus, 'Fly by Night' opens the album with energy, but electronic sounds are not exaggerated.  The evenness of the instrumental and vocal sound  does justice to the music.  'Trains'  is possibly one of the more critical tests of the mastering engineer's art.  On my Russian CD this track's slippery synthesizers and rubbery bass line sounded cartoonish.  Tamed by better mastering, the synthesized instruments now sound like parts of an organic whole, even the synth drums sounding proportional to everything else.<br /><br />Ian Anderson, in his liner notes, makes the surprising admission that he had only a vinyl copy of this album in his possession when asked to reassess it for the current release.  This was probably a good thing.  \\"Walk Into Light\\" was one of the later LP releases from the classic era of that format, and a fairly early CD.  While the sound of LPs had been perfected over many years, the CD, in its infancy, had a lot of catching up to do, and the first CD of \\"Walk Into Light\\" was disappointing.  With the current CD release, though, a listener is likely to hear the same refined sound that Ian Anderson rediscovered on his nearly thirty-year-old vinyl record.<br /><br />Ian states modestly that this album seems to have held up fairly well over the years, judging it a successful effort.  He intended this music to look into the future, pushing boundaries a bit with the instrumentations and arrangements, but also to the past (he  certainly makes this point  with 'Trains').  Three decades after its vinyl release this music once again sounds good, and validates Ian's view that the project succeeded.  When he received his anticipated copy of this CD reissue, I'm willing to bet he was pleased.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Right before reading Wool I read Suzanne Collins's Hunger Game trilogy.  One is already a classic, and the other I suspect is soon to be.<br /><br />Both are very easy reads about post-apocalyptic futures.  Both have great character development and both will keep you from doing much else until you finish reading them.<br /><br />A big difference is that everyone has heard of Hunger Games, and very few (yet) have heard about Wool.  Oh, and Ms. Colllins has stated, rightly IMO, that there won't be any further episodes of the HG saga, and Mr. Howley seems to be an extremely prolific author already publishing a prequel to Wool, and other chapters have been promised.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good use of $6.00 of your entertainment budget, I would strongly recommend spending it here.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously how many times can you use the phrase \\"My inner goddess\\" in a single book?! Lost focus 5 pages in, not worth my $$
B007MAETA8|5.0|I'm always surrounded by people who cringe at the mere mention of John Mayer. I can't say i'm surprised when people give me the \\"WTF\\" face whenever I tell them I'm a huge fan. Admittedly, it's a little tough to get yourself past songs like Your Body Is A Wonderland or Come Back To Bed and how overly pop they are so you can enjoy his music.<br /><br />As I've always said, the real heart of a musicians repertoire lies deeper in their discography. You just have to do a little digging to find the real gems and masterpieces. Nobody I know has any clue what Wheel sounds like, or that John actually covered Hendrix on Continuum, or that he has SRV tattoo'd on his arm. For years, I was the same way. I wrote John Mayer off as some ridiculous pop hack writing catchy tunes just to get the girls excited... That was until a friend brought Try! into work one night and put it in for us to listen to. While everyone else was busy lamenting on how lame it was, I was fixated. I needed to hear more, and one of the tracks that stood out the most was Gravity. I had to have Continuum. That was the album that completely changed my position on Mayer's music. I've always been a blues fan, and I had rarely heard a contemporary artist channel the blues feeling as well as John did on that album. I'm Gonna Find Another you was absolutely beautiful and a perfect nod to Peter Green's Need Your Love So Bad. I've been a huge fan and promoter of John's music ever since. I gained an even deeper respect for him after learning about his affection for Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Where The Light is was the album that truly sealed the deal for me. It's Even better that he kinda sounds like Stevie. ;)<br /><br />The point being that Born and Raised is no exception. It's equally as brilliant and addictive as Continuum. Whereas on his 2006 album he was channeling and imitating the blues sound, on BaR he channels his southern rock and country chops. When you listen to the music, you taste a little Neil Young, Allman Brothers, Hank Williams and John's own flavor injection. It's a little disconcerting to know that many will write this album off because of John's reputation, but it's definitely a must listen. I don't know that I would consider any of the tracks pop station staples because most mainstream listeners won't get them, but it doesn't make them any less effective or infectious for the seasoned Mayer vet. The thing I love the most about the album is probably it's low key nature. It takes a more reserved, acoustic approach and relies less on overproduction or polishing and instead relies on feeling, telling a story and sending a message. I liken the approach to what Springsteen did with Nebraska. Something about a stripped down, raw album hits home for me more than a polished, meticulously arranged album ever could.<br /><br />I have to say that Walt Grace, Love Is A Verb, Queen of California and Something Like Olivia are the standouts for me. The very latter being a song I can easily see myself cranking in my 1980 TA while I roll down the highway, T-Tops off and a bandana keeping the hair out of my face. It's apparent that John has been listening to his share of Neil Young. He even makes reference to Young's After The Goldrush (another must listen for fans of southern/classic rock) on the opener Queen of California. It's actually a little funny (and ironic) that John is able to do country better on this album than most contemporary \\"country\\"  musicians can (I'm talking mainstream pop radio country). Sure, he's no Hank Williams, Buck Owens, Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline or even Merle Haggard, but he sure sounds like he'd be right at home on stage with them, given what he's showed us on this album (please listen to the Born and Raised reprise). Queen of California reminds me of Midnight Rider. Heck, just look at the album cover. That alone is the perfect nod to classic 60s and 70s southern rock bands (I feel a heavy Marshall Tucker, Molly Hatchet and Allman Brothers vibe going on there).<br /><br />I was a little skeptical to hear this album after hearing Battle Studies, but I wasn't afraid. I know what John is capable of, and even if I didn't like his previous album as much as Heavier Things or Continuum, I knew there would at least be something here I could gravitate towards. What impresses me is how complete and honest BaR feels. The most important seller for any album is its ability to connect with me on a personal level. Whether I'm looking for something that's fun or something I can relate to, that's always the deciding factor over how much i'll like an album. John has nailed the flavor, emotion and feeling he was going for with this. After my first 5 listens, the only thing I could think of was how much I wanted two of my closest friends to hear it. Walt Grace has been on repeat for 2 days running. :)<br /><br />Please don't be fooled by the lack of guitar driven tracks or ooey gooey \\"gives me chills\\" solos that were abundant on Continuum. There aren't any here, and that's the point. We already know John is capable of shredding, so there's no need to demonstrate it for us again. Instead, what he's done with Born and Raised is put together an ensemble of tracks that are more suited to a relaxed, \\"sit on my porch with a beer and watch the rain come down\\" atmosphere (as songs like Speak For Me demonstrate beautifully). John is still able to display his uncanny knack for melody, harmony and killer guitar licks. Don't focus so much on how technical the guitar work sounds. Instead, focus on the mood it conveys, the ambiance it creates and ultimately what it invokes in you after you've heard it.<br /><br />I don't think it's appropriate to do a track by track review of the album, because everyone interprets and experiences the music differently. I felt it was more appropriate to give you a more rounded view of how it feels as a whole. Overall, it's a little country, it's a little southern rock (If I ever get around to living sounds likeYoung's \\"Old Man\\"), and there are tinges of blues sprinkled throughout the album (Something Like Olivia is a standard 12 bar blues progression). Bottom line, if you're a borderline, \\"I don't really know if I should get this\\" Mayer fan, rest assured you won't be disappointed. It's no mistake that he was able to convince Guys like Graham Nash and David Crosby to record with him here. They know as well as guys like Clapton know that John is the real deal. This is definitely one of those albums you want to have a physical copy of because it is that good. A huge improvement over Battle Studies and a worthy contender to Continuum. I'll be listening to this for years to come and defining pieces of my life on the songs therein. That's the true sign of a classic.<br /><br />5 Stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoyed playing this games myself.  My grandchildren also enjoyed.  I helped them on harder  parts.  They have asked that I get more games for them.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Cons:<br /><br />Well..it is true that Lucas did change and add some Scenes..The only Major difference in this Box set is Obiwan's dragon scare which he does to scare the Tuskin Raiders away .IMO at first it sounded like a Drunk old man is running at you while stepping on broken glass.  That was a WTF moment for me, but after watching it a few times though its just funny..(So basically no big deal)....<br /><br /> Now for the Scene in ROTJ when Vader has to make his decision to save Luke or kill the Emperor, Lucas added that NOOOOOOO!!!! while Vader is thinking. IMO that was completely unnecessary because even though you cant see his face physically that doesn't necessarily mean you cant  see the Emotion in him. In the original you see him looking at both of them while music is playing and the camera zooming in on him which was enough to know that he is going to do the right thing..<br /><br />Pros:<br />  The puppet Yoda in the Episode 1 is changed to the new digital Yoda which is episode 3 quality one. (Way  Better)<br />In Episode 5 when Luke gets attacked by the Wampa you can see the Actors arm, so that was fixed also.<br /><br />But other than the boring stuff I just said.. the Box set is worth it, Picture quality is very good, Sound is even better (10/10 with surround sound :D)<br /><br />One more thing: This set also comes with 40 Hours of extra footage so if your hardcore this is the thing to buy..And the case looks amazing with all the artwork and everything is held together nicely.
0345803485|1.0|This book is AWFUL! The characters, the plot, even the sex was RIDICULOUS and so unbelievable. She constantly refers to her \\"scowling subconscious\\" and her \\"panting inner goddess'  to the point where I was rolling my eyes and cringing at every mention. There is endless repetition throughout the whole book! It's sad that this is a bestseller. It's even sadder that I fell for the hype.

0985114606|4.0|Needing something to fill the void after 50 shades, this book did the trick. Steamy read, I will argue not as well written as 50 shades, but still captivating and the characters find a way of getting to you. At first I thought it was trying to hard to rip off the other series. However,the author added enough unique elements to the characters and situations to bring something new to the hot sex and animal attraction between two people with a lot of baggage.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|There is nothing redeeming in this movie.  It is a chilling reminder of human depravity cloaked in a beautiful cinematography.  Jeffrey Dahmer would rank this 5 stars.  I wish I could recoup the time I invested.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|I was waiting for this album ever since I heard they where making another one. Has its light and dark points in the album that is also a trade mark from their other albums as well. Dave did a great job in making himself fit in and I love that you can Hear Mark lanegans voice on in the morning towards the end. These guys can't make a bad album.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Like a Hopper painting given life these seven musical tone poems stay with you.<br /><br />I first heard the Blue Nile on a Linn sound system some 22 years ago. It was on a cold November night in Belfast, Northern Ireland.<br /><br />This album is heart breaking,  beautiful and sad. Empty streets, neon lights, wet pavements and a single lonely figure slowly making their way home. These images are conjured by Paul Buchanans world weary voice. It will stay with you long after the final note fades.<br /><br />I was also lucky enough to see them perfrom live some 5 years ago.<br /><br />Make sure to check out Paul Buchahan's new solo album just released this week. It is an import into the USA.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|People amaze me with these negative reviews! This movie was great! I actually wish it had gone a little longer because the story felt like it was supposed to keep going but the movie ended. I think this is a clever way to get a generation that could really care less about history to the movie theater and actually teach them something about what happened to the Tuskegee Airmen.  The fact that there was another movie made about it has nothing to do with what this movie brings to the table.  I had no problems with the acting at all other than Neyo's character and that horrible accent.  Even taking that into account it is not enough to tank the movie for me. My advice to anyone that has not seen the movie would be to go ahead and buy it and view it for yourself. Screw a critic and become your own critic! I enjoyed the movie so it receives a 5 star rating!
0307730697|5.0|Love, strength, caring, fearlessness, faith, dedication, selflessness, these are all qualities that Adam Brown possessed. As a Navy Seal he epitomized the American warrior. Of the many stories that could be told of the Seals, his comrades invariably pointed to his story as the one they would like told. He was no saint. He would would be the first to admit he had his faults and his demons. Shortly out of high school, he became hooked on drugs, after he failed to find a direction for his life. He fell to the depths of lying to and stealing from his own family to support his habit. The turning point came when his parents realizing they could not help him, turned him in to the police. His mother was overcome as she and her husband watched him being handcuffed and taken to jail. Adam was crushed, but found remorse and the Lord while in jail. He resolved to beat the drugs and to once again become the type of person of whom his parents would be proud. It wasn't an easy road. He was helped by his new girl friend and future wife, Kelley. He determined to enlist in the Navy and become a Seal, the best the Navy had to offer. How could a man who admitted he was addicted to drugs turn his life around and become a Navy Seal? This book is the story of a man's struggle to overcome all odds. He started by devoting his life to faith in God, by not taking no for an answer, by not allowing others to tell him he could not get where he wanted to go. Adam Brown overcame obstacles that would stop most men dead in their tracks. At one point in training he lost the sight of his right eye in a training accident. Instead of giving up he trained himself to use the other eye to aim with, maintaining his marksmanship qualification. Later on a mission, the fingers of his right hand were crushed and nearly severed. He endured the pain of having his fingers reattached and when he found they would not work efficiently, he trained himself to shoot accurately with his left hand. He accomplished all ofthis with the support of his family, his teammates, and his faith in God. He seemed to be able to overcome any odds, until that night raid in Afghanistan on March 17, 2010. This is a very good book which recounts the life of a man who stood for all the best this country has to offer. He was selfless and brave. A man of faith and family. He was a man to look up to. His story, one that in these times truly needed to be told. The way he led his life was inspirational. A man any of us would be proud to know. This book was provided by the publishers for review.

Also on top of that the hair was just hard as a rock so it needed to be washed as well!<br />The outfit is not not.

1594203059|4.0|The elevator pitch for Niall Ferguson's \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest\\" is simple: Western civilization has risen to dominate world affairs over the last five hundred years, a record unmatched in world history and at odds with its population and geography relative to other countries and civilizations, due to six \\"killer apps\\" that have provided an advantage on the international stage. Further, it may be the West's loss of those same \\"apps\\" that is leading to decline now.<br /><br />Ferguson pegs the rise of the West to dominance at about the same time as the discovery of the Americas, and so, having just finished a look at that chapter of history in \\"1491\\" and \\"1493\\", I decided to take a closer look at Ferguson's argument. What was the secret of the West? And could we really be headed towards decline or collapse?<br /><br />Where many histories today focus on the specific \\"modules\\" of history, drilling down to look closely at specific persons or events (think Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals\\" on Abraham Lincoln's political management or Horowitz's \\"Midnight Rising\\" on the John Brown raid at Harper's Ferry), Ferguson takes another tact by looking at the broad strokes of history to find themes, the grand \\"narratives\\" of history, as he calls them. Where other historians dig into the details, Ferguson wants to look at the big picture. As he explains in the preface:<br /><br />\\"Watching my three children grow up, I had the uneasy feeling that they were learning less history than I had learned at their age, not because they had bad teachers but because they had bad history books and even worse examinations. Watching the financial crisis [of the late 2000s] unfold, I realized that they were far from alone, for it seemed as if only a handful of people in the banks and treasuries of the Western world had more than the sketchiest information about the last Depression. For roughly thirty years, young people at Western schools and universities have been given the idea of a liberal education, without the substance of historical knowledge. They have been taught isolated `modules', not narratives, much less chronologies. They have been trained in the formulaic analysis of document excerpts, not in the key skill of reading widely and fast. They have been encouraged to feel empathy with imagined Roman centurions or Holocaust victims, not to write essays about why and how their predicaments arose.\\"<br /><br />With that flippant, matter of fact, almost \\"devil-may-care\\" attitude then, Ferguson determines to take the reader through a grand narrative of the last five hundred years, identifying six \\"killer apps\\" that Western civilization adopted to rise to a dominance unmatched in breadth and duration in human history.  It is this broad overview, as told in Ferguson's urgent and quick-witted voice, that makes the extended argument so interesting and in an age of multicultural relativism, refreshing. Welding his argument--not just about the cause of Western civilization's success, but also that \\"the historian can commune with the dead by imaginatively reconstructing their experiences\\" to inform and predict the future--Ferguson spins together the documents, events, and personalities to form a narrative, a story, about why the West succeeded in the face of larger, richer, and, at the onset, more wealthy civilizations.<br /><br />The \\"tools\\" to which he attributes the rise of the West are likened to \\"apps,\\" downloadable software that augment computers and mobile devices. By looking at the narrative, Ferguson finds the roots of the West's success, as well as why, perhaps, the West as begun to decline while other civilizations advance.  Not specific to the West, but, like the real world apps in the metaphor, the values can be \\"downloaded\\" by any culture for similar results, and in the closing Ferguson addresses the adaptation by non-Western cultures that have done, and are doing,  just that with success.<br /><br />The \\"apps\\" Ferguson finds, while not necessarily surprising, are informative: competition, science, property rights, medicine, consumption and the birth of the \\"consumer society\\" (\\"without which the Industrial Revolution would have been unsustainable\\") and  Max Weber's Protestant \\"work ethic\\". While the narrative is anything but chronological, Ferguson's grasp of history and the sweeping strokes with which he paints the narrative provide fascinating reading. One cannot sense, however, that Ferguson, almost anything but apologetic, is on the verge of glorying in the success of the British Empire during its hey-day as a colonial power, noting with statistical explanation the improvements brought to the world through Western influence, whether it be in medicine, literacy, and education. Or blue jeans, for in the end, one side effect of rise of the West is not diversity, but conformity as cultures imitate and emulate Western styles, habits, and philosophy.<br /><br />Ironically to this writer, who sees such deep and lasting value in the political institutions of the West, Ferguson notes that one area where the West has not been uniformly imitated is the political.<br /><br />\\"Only in the realm of political institutions does there remain significant global diversity, with a wide range of governments around the world resisting the idea of the rule of law, with its protection of individual rights, as the foundation for meaningful representative government.\\"<br /><br />In other words, we'll take your blue jeans, your medicine, even your work ethic, but you can keep the Bill of Rights and representative government, they say.  Indeed, it is that  imitation of the West that has brought China from the depths of the Cultural Revolution to heights today when its economy can weather the financial crisis without more than a hiccup.<br /><br />After Ferguson's narrative through the six \\"apps\\", then, we reach the essential question suggested by any study of the West's rise: is the West now in decline? And if so, is it too late to reverse?<br /><br />Perhaps not. Although China's rise seems ominous, and indeed, Ferguson cites China's relative nonchalance towards doing business with the dictators and warlords of the world business \\"it's just business\\" as evidence that China is more concerned about rising than its popularity, China still faces problems that could arrest its progress, especially from social unrest, political pressure from its growing and unrepresented middle-class, or friction with its neighbors in Asia.<br /><br />Noting that a \\"retreat from the mountains of the Hindu Kush\\" (Afghanistan) seems to proceed the fall of any empire--be it Alexander's, British, Russian, or most recently American--Ferguson is unwilling to give up on the West, yet.  No, the things that set the West apart are no longer distinct, but nor has the entire package of \\"apps\\" been embraced.<br /><br />\\"The Chinese have got capitalism. The Iranians have got science. The Russians have got democracy. The Africans are (slowly) getting modern medicine. And the Turks have got the consumer society. But what this means is that Western modes of operation are not in decline but are flourishing nearly everywhere, with only a few remaining pockets of resistance. A growing number of Resterners [Ferguson's name for non-Westerners] are sleeping, showering, dressing, working, playing, eating, drinking and travelling like Westerners.  Moreover, as we have seen, Western civilization is more than just one thing; it is a package. It is about political pluralism (multiple states and multiple authorities) as well as capitalism; it is about the freedom of thought as well as the scientific method; it is about the rule of law and property rights as well as democracy. Even today, the West still has more of these institutional advantages than the Rest. The Chinese do not have political competition. The Iranians do not have freedom of conscience. They get to vote in Russia, but the rule of law there is a sham. In none of these countries is there a free press. These differences may explain why, for example, all three countries lag behind Western countries in qualitative indices that measure`national innovative development' and `national innovation capacity'.\\"<br /><br />True, the West is not without its faults, he says, but our downfall will come from within, not from external pressure. It's the loss of the \\"killer apps\\" by our culture that will, in the long and short run, lead to our continued decline.  Don't mistake the adoption, however, by others as the reason for the decline of the West. Rather, it is the West's abandonment of the values that brought them prominence that is leading to the decline. Here, again, Ferguson picks up the theme in his preface--we must learn from history. If we are to maintain the great values that gave the West its rise, we must study and learn the great works--the documents--that teach those values.* Add up all the values, and, like any follower of Churchill, it adds up to courage and action.<br /><br />\\"Today, as then [1938 and the German Nazi threat to Western civilization], the biggest threat to Western civilization is posed not by other civilizations, but by our own pusillanimity - and by the historical ignorance that feeds it.\\"<br /><br />__________________________<br /><br />* Ferguson's recommended \\"standard works\\" for Western civilization are:<br /><br />The King James Bible<br />Isaac Newton's Principa<br />John Locke's Two Treatises of Government<br />Adam Smith's Moral Sentiments and Wealth of Nations<br />Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France<br />Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species<br />William Shakespeare's plays<br />Selected speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill<br />Also, if he could select only one of the above, it would be Shakespeare's collected works.ate to reverse?<br /><br />Perhaps not.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Watching 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' for the first time in 20 years, and the first time as an adult, I was surprised at how well the film holds up.  It's full of easily relatable, but genuinely charming, humor and gorgeous hand drawn animation.  For long-time fans, I'm probably not tell you anything new, but if, like me, you have not seen the film in years, please check it out.<br /><br />Also, its easy to share with your grandma on her tube tv.  The blu-ray includes 'Disneyvision' a process that features the film in a full frame aspect, but instead of hearing granny complain about the 'black lines on the screen!', the unused screen space is filled with beautiful framing, complimenting each scene.  For example, there may be pillars in the castle, or trees and vines framing a forest scene.  A very nice touch.  After a few minutes, the framing melded with the animation and felt like a wonderful addition.  I watched it on a widescreen television, but wanted to check out this new feature.<br /><br />A gem to share with younger generations as well as old time fans.
030771652X|4.0|SISTER, by Rosamund Lupton, is an award winning debut novel by the British novelist. I acquired her second book, AFTERWARD, so thought I would read the author's first book to get a taste of what her writing is like. This is a suspense novel with literary roots and presented in a very unique fashion.<br /><br />The entire novel is one long \\"letter\\" written to Tess by her sister Beatrice. Tess is dead, and Beatrice is writing the letter after it has been discovered what really happened to Tess and Beatrice is waiting to testify at the trial. In her letter, Beatrice promises not to get ahead of herself, so she tells the story as it happens, beginning when she gets the call from her mum that she hasn't heard from Tess in a few days. Tess was pregnant, and Beatrice is very concerned. She and Tess were very close. The story is quite simple really. It is about Beatrice refusing to believe her 21 year-old sister killed herself, and her quest to find out what really happened even though no one believed her.<br /><br />The gimmick: This novel is definitely told in a way I've never seen before. It takes a while to get used to Beatrice constantly addressing \\"you,\\" or Tess, the dead sister she is writing. The story is also told in two timelines. One, as Beatrice's investigation of Tess's death unfolds, and after the fact, as she gives her statement to the police. This is a clever way to tell the story, but at times it takes the place of actual story.<br /><br />The twist: There is a twist in the final chapter. I don't think it changes the story for better or worse. I'm kind of ambivalent about it. I love twists that turn the story on its head, but this twist really doesn't do that. I hand it to the author for trying something like that, but it wasn't really necessary. The story was good enough without it.<br /><br />I can't wait to read AFTERWARD, and see how Lupton follows up her great debut novel.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Another excellent product from the best & most versatile guitarist and blues rock artist in the industry today.  I have all of Joe Bonamassa's CDs and DVDs.  Having listened to this one now 4 times after pre-ordering it from Amazon it has seriously grown on me.  Probably my favorite overall since The Ballad of John Henry.  I particularly like the Dislocated Boy and Driving Towards The Daylight tracks, but I really don't think there's a weak one on the entire CD.  Perhaps the most interesting is Heavenly Soul, which I wasn't sure what to think of at first, but has since become a favorite.  With interesting vocal harmonies and guitar riff, in my opinion the creative blues/country shredder solo at the end of Heavenly Soul is the absolute best JB solo on the release, highlighting his Danny Gatton influence.  I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates great music and extreme talent.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|A free app of the day that is not a cheap piece of crap. I was going to uninstall the Amazon app store this morning due to the fact that everything on the free app of the day is worthless junk. This game actually sounded good and had good reviews. It is a well made good looking fun game and I recommend it. Five bucks may be a bit steep but you will get hours of fun if you like this sort of game. I find sudoku  bit much, this is more fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's crazy how good this series is.  Completely consumed by the need to know what happens next, and thinking about the story whenever I wasn't actively reading it, I found Wool compelling and fascinating.  The writing is so descriptive and evocative that I felt as though I could *see* what was happening as I read about it.  Which of course made me realize what a terrific series of movies it would be!  As soon as I finished the Omnibus and book 6, I wanted to start the series over.  In fact, I've got a little time before bed...

We particularly liked the new sections on skeleton arguments (with the skeleton being just that... a skeleton!) and the CD ROM to go with the book is a boon for the busy practitioner and very handy to use.<br /><br />The first edition appeared in 2007 and, five years on, this new edition fulfills its aim to guide readers towards using pleadings and applications in the most efficient and effective way. You do have a comprehensive, time-saving collection of pleadings, applications and court orders in one place without having to carry many heavy books around.<br /><br />The three authors, Martin Bare, Leila Benyounes and Richard Copnall, together with additional contributions from Andrew Axon and Dominic Hughes have fully updated the first edition and now include sections on the following: clinical negligence; holiday claims; skeleton arguments and PI claims in contract; recent decisions on the Animals Act and vicarious liability; mesothelioma; RTA claims processes, the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 2010; and insolvency provisions of the Companies Act 2006.<br /><br />We do applaud the sentiments in the Preface where the authors say: \\"To those brought up in the tradition of `prayers', `aforesaids' and `thunderbuss' particulars, our approach to pleadings will be a revelation.\\"  Stand by for the revelation! And it is very welcome to the Bar and the Bench.<br /><br />They have deliberately (and rightly) removed legalese and verbiage to create an approach which is both clear and concise, and to repeat their words \\"efficient and, above all, effective\\".<br /><br />Whilst many areas of personal injury law are complex, always remember that the variety of factual situations is limitless (that is why we have so much court work!) so each precedent must be carefully tailored to the circumstances of a specific case.<br /><br />It is the adaptation which remains the key and the work put in by these three expert authors, Bare, Benyounes and Copnall and their colleagues is most gratefully received for those who want their pleadings to reflect the way we practice in the 21st century.and, above all, effective\\".<br /><br />Whilst many areas of personal injury law are complex, always remember that the variety of factual situations is limitless (that is why we have so much court work!) so each precedent must be carefully tailored to the circumstances of a specific case.<br /><br />It is the adaptation which remains the key and the work put in by these three expert authors, Bare, Benyounes and Copnall and their colleagues is most gratefully received for those who want their pleadings to reflect the way we practice in the 21st century.

And, as we know within the courts and tribunals, it is the issue of whether a person is or employed or self-employed, which remains the most troubling in many matters.<br /><br />The eighth edition sets out to re-evaluate the legislative landscape surrounding the law on dismissal with the repeal of the statutory disciplinary and grievance procedures. However, we would agree with Upex and Hardy that unfair dismissal continues to reinvent itself- of course, the same could be said of many other areas of law because that is what we do as barristers- `nit picking' or as it is more customarily described, `having a fine intellectual grasp of the law' (or, at least some of us do!)<br /><br />The beauty of this work for the practitioner remains the extensive level of detail contained in what is a reasonably short work with its meticulous footnoting throughout and serious attention to detail with the more recent cases such as Spaceright, Pannu and Hunter v McCarrick concerning service provision charges and the continuing controversy of the 2006 TUPE Regs.<br /><br />We feel that one of the greatest assets of this new edition is the key case law selected by the authors. Of particular interest will be consideration of the Court of Appeal's decision in Aegon during the current economic situation where the elements of calculation and any pension losses are considered.<br /><br />The aim of the book remains the same: to consider the main causes of action available to employees whose employment has been terminated, and then to present the law and the relevant issues for the benefit of practitioners.<br /><br />The eighth edition also covers the statutory rights given by the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the rights given by the common law to employees whose employment has ended.<br /><br />Of particular help to advocates is the statement on the law of wrongful dismissal which the authors describe as being derived exclusively from the common law and developed in a series of 19th and 20th century decisions. As we all know, wrongful dismissal remains of great importance as employment tribunals now hear such cases.<br /><br />The book does remain a `cure-all' statement of law for practitioners and human resource managers whether they are advising employers or employees.<br /><br />It enables such professionals to decide what claims might be available to a dismissed employee, the types of remedy available, and the levels of compensation which can be currently awarded in less than 500 pages, yet with the attention to detail which we need when advising clients just before a hearing.ployees whose employment has been terminated, and then to present the law and the relevant issues for the benefit of practitioners.<br /><br />The eighth edition also covers the statutory rights given by the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the rights given by the common law to employees whose employment has ended.<br /><br />Of particular help to advocates is the statement on the law of wrongful dismissal which the authors describe as being derived exclusively from the common law and developed in a series of 19th and 20th century decisions.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down (well, technically my Kindle, but you get my point).  I fell in love with bad boy Travis right away, despite his arrogance and active, um... love...no...\\"social life\\".  What can I say, I'm a sucker for tough guys with tattoos.  And Travis (mad-dog) Maddox is definitely a tough guy!  It took a while for me to understand and feel a connection with Abby, which appears to have been the authors intentions, as it takes most of the book for you to find out her life's story.  If I knew Abby's whole story right away, I probably wouldn't have thought a friendship with Travis was the best thing for her.  This book has become my \\"go to\\" book, when I read another romance book that falls short of real love story, I re-read Beautiful Disaster and all is well in the world again!
0199562822|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1BGR0R8V5OS4Y]]<br /><br />ON FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY FOR LEGAL AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Distinguished by its thoroughness and clarity, this superb handbook guides practitioners through the sometimes miasmic overlap between psychiatry and law.  It's particularly and obviously relevant to legal practitioners who either prosecute or represent mentally disordered patients, or those who may be suspected of having a mental disorder.<br /><br />Forensic psychiatry, as the term indicates, is cross-disciplinary.  It's defined by the learned authors as comprising `the psychiatry of mental disorder and offending behaviours, plus law in relation to all psychiatry'.  Both of these aspects are represented in this handbook.<br /><br />`It is not possible either effectively or ethically,' say the authors,  `to guide an offender patient through the justice system... or properly to assist the justice system in dealing with mentally disordered offenders, without a real understanding of legal process and of the interface between law and psychiatry'.<br /><br />The stated aim of the authors is to summarise and describe areas of law which are relevant to this interface, thus rendering the handbook of immense value, not just to lawyers, but for clinicians whose work is regulated by the law.<br /><br />Part of the Oxford Medical Publications Library published by the Oxford University Press, this handbook of almost 700 pages, is actually the first edition of `Forensic Psychiatry' and like the other specialist handbooks in psychiatry published by the OUP, it's formatted as a quick reference tool -- compact yet authoritative and complete - and designed to save the busy practitioner valuable time.<br /><br />It's written by a distinguished team of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists working in consultation with over thirty other experts who have contributed their advice, including, certainly, psychiatrists and psychologists, as well as lawyers, judges and academics.<br /><br />Here -- to cite just one example -- is where, if you're a lawyer, you would look for guidance in understanding the psychiatrist's court report, or the risk assessment offered to the court.<br /><br />The Handbook is divided into five parts covering, for example in Parts II and III, clinical forensic psychiatry and the ethics of forensic psychiatry.

B005FFW46S|4.0|I will say up front that this is, as with all the Discorld books, absolutely an enjoyable book, a real pleasure to read. Nonetheless, in a lot of ways I definitely felt that this was one of the weakest of the Discworld novels and of the Sam Vimes books in particular. The primary problem I feel, as some others have pointed out, is that the focus of the book is entirely on Sam Vimes himself, a character who began and has always excelled as a part of an ensemble and an underdog. At this point in the series however, Vimes has been through so much and has become such a prominent figure on the Disc, that he has almost lost everything that made him interesting. He no longer has to struggle to succeed, but merely does so by simply being better than everyone else, especially with the added supernatural element of having a demonic force trapped inside that frequently aids him. In a sense, he's become the Discworld's Batman; the grim, driven, unstoppable crime-fighter that always comes out on top, leaving all sense of actual danger and suspense behind because, at this point, Sam Vimes could breathe in space.<br />So Vimes is dragged to the Ramkin estate in the country for a holiday, against his protests. Of course we expect him to uncover some kind of crime when he gets there, but rather than actually uncovering a crime he basically just announces as soon as he gets there that crime is afoot. How does he know this? Because he's Sam Vimes and he's just that clever.<br />Throughout the book we see him casually dispatching every single antagonist he encounters. He goes into town and is challenged to a fight with a man twice his size and half his age, and he quickly and efficiently defeats him. Why? Because he's Sam Vimes and he's just better. Of course a real villain is eventually discovered, a vicious murderer with absolutely no regard for life, and of course Vimes is able to best him at every encounter, because he's Sam Vimes and he's just better.<br />To his credit though, Pratchett is very much aware of this, as much of the book is a reflection on just how far Vimes has risen over the course of the series. He's unstoppable because he's already been through everything else, which in a way makes this book's greatest weakness also its greatest strength. Vimes is here portrayed as an entirely infallible protagonist, but he's also earned his right to be that infallible protagonist. Vimes has come such a long way that there really is nowhere else for him to go, except on holiday. And in that sense I feel that, if there are never anymore books about Sam Vimes, than this makes for a fitting end to his career.
B000750OEA|5.0|I love this DVD, as it has all of Kylie's big hits on videos in one DVD. The key word is \\"big hits\\" and so of course only Kylie's big hits on videos are showcased here. So it's still good to have Kylie's \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" as that has all of Kylie's PWL videos. \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" covers Kylie's videos from \\"Kylie\\" to \\"Ultimate Kylie\\", so if you haven't gotten Kylie's \\"Hits DVD Edition\\", I suggest you do as that covers the \\"X\\" and \\"Aphrodite\\" videos. This DVD plays Kylie's videos in chronological order unlike the \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" DVD, but also unlike the \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" DVD, this DVD does not have alternate videos, interviews, or behind the scenes like \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" does. That would have been great to have that added onto this DVD also, oh well, I guess us fans in the states can't get too picky about the little things, as any Kylie DVD available for US market is great. So if this DVD is not in any Kylie fans collection, you better hurry cause it seems like this DVD is becoming scarce and outrageously priced.<br /><br />\\"1988: Kylie\\"<br />01.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a wonderful puzzle book!  I have been looking for one on kindle-but there are a few different names for this type of puzzle. This kind of puzzle is even hard to find in a bookstore! I LOVE this book!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|\\"Jeez, my inner goddess swoons.\\"  \\"Jeez, he looks so freaking hot.\\" \\"Jeez, what have I done now?\\"<br />Please make it stop!  I cannot grasp how or why this has become the phenomenon that is has. The writing is juvenile and repetitious.  The characters are flat.  The plot is weak.  I kept holding out hope that it would improve as it went on.  No such luck.  I actually found myself fast-forwarding through the sex scenes because they were so ridiculous.  Anastasia's earth-shattering orgasms had me laughing out loud...and I'm pretty sure that wasn't the author's intended response. The whole thing was more silly than sexy.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun game!! I lose track of time very easy when playing this. If you enjoy picross you will enjoy this, worth the money.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has a new fan!  He was able to give the characters intelligent and mature voices while simultaneously maintaining their youth and innocence.  I have no idea how he was able to strike such a perfect balance, but I loved every word of the dialogue between Hazel and Gus.  I believed them and I believed in their love.  This book is truly a gem.  My husband asked me what it was about and didn't quite understand my reply.  I said, \\"it's a funny, witty book about a kid that has cancer.\\"  The next day, he found me curled up with my kindle, sobbing uncontrollably.  (well, maybe that's a little dramatic...but you get the picture)  It's the kind of book that makes you feel an array of emotions and has you wondering what the characters are up to when you are away from them.  I'm in my 30's and have just recently started reading YA.  If this is any indication of what the genre has to offer, than I've really been missing out.  I just started An Abundance of Katherines and I'm adoring it so far.  Read this book!  You'll be happy and sad that you did.
0345803485|4.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" the first in a trilogy of supposed-erotica seems more a psychological study of one woman's choice regarding what she truly desires from a relationship with a man than a tale of twisted sex.<br /><br />First person narrator, Anastasia Steele, the young, newly-graduated college girl with a degree in English literature, knows what kind of man turns her on--Angel Clare in Hardy's \\"[[ASIN:014043514X Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Penguin Classics)]]\\" or maybe Mr. Darcy of \\"[[ASIN:0486284735 Pride and Prejudice (Dover Thrift Editions)]].\\"  Nevertheless, despite her romantic inclinations, Ana is unprepared for the electricity generated between her and Christian Grey, a young and extremely wealthy entrepreneur she interviews while substituting for her journalist roommate. E.L. James' Grey smolders with hot intensity--he's movie star attractive with his own helicopter, jet and multi-billion dollar company--what's not to like?  Poor Ana does not have a chance, he has her way before `hello' or the multitude of text messages and emails the two compulsively share.  Grey's only black mark is his penchant for rough sex.  Like, I said, poor Ana--helicopters, jets, a gifted Mac, a Blackberry,  a car and a smarting rear end.  Ouch!<br /><br />Like all young women, Ana seems surprised at the power she seems to hold over Grey's stylishly tousled head.  She cannot get over how fetchingly Grey's pants hang off his slender hips.  James' frequent interjection of an italicized \\"Oh my\\" whenever Ana is sexually or emotionally titillated brings the thrill of first love or lust as experienced by a girl of Ana's age brilliantly alive.  But like most women, Ana is guilty of the most typical relationship mistake.  She assumes that through her love and devotion--her acquiescence to all of Grey's desires--she will eventually convince Grey of the vastness of her infinite and selfless love and that he, in turn, will share every aspect of himself with her as he has done with no other. She thinks she can change him.  Ha!  Danger, Will Robinson!<br /><br />Do women ever really think of the kind of life they will have with a man that they think they constantly have to \\"work on?\\"  Imagine thirty years of asking Grey, \\"can I touch you today?\\"  or \\"is today the day you love me enough to share your psychosis?\\"  No thanks!  In this sense, James' narrative is quite realistic about Ana's naivety; her portrayal of Ana as a young woman wanting so much to please at the expense of her own thought regarding love and what works for her rings true. Ana deludes herself until she realizes that simple is much better.  No fighting and no biting also means no doubt.<br /><br />With that all in mind, and with the knowledge that eventually Ana realizes that although she is drawn to the handsome albeit damaged Grey, she cannot accept his less-than-perfect terms and so moves out of his scene with her integrity intact, why does this simple story generate so much negativity?  It can't be because the book thrums with such scandalously kinky sex!  In this age of Internet porn and relaxed moralities, this tale of slightly forbidden fruit is a bit freeze-dried. Even teenage-targeted television series that advocate multiple partners and so many other emotionally challenging issues that would put even the most savvy and world-weary sophisticate into a quagmire of hysteria erode their audiences in a much more damaging way--through repeated exposure that breeds a redefinition of what is simply bad behavior.  Keeping things simple and true to self insures happiness not only on a Dali Lama spiritual level but on a grounded awareness platform of what works and what does not.<br /><br />The fact that the origin of \\"Fifty Shades\\"  is \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction at one time entitled \\"Master of the Universe,\\" should not come as any surprise; Ana's view of Grey rivals that of Bella's regard of Edward.  Both Grey and Edward fit into the \\"monster\\" category--one sucks blood, the other wants todraw blood.  Both women will prove to be the sole salvation for these enigmatic men.  Both foster an increased self-confidence in the two female narrators.  The premise of both these novels seem to empower woman who wish to be the thorn in the side of controlling men and ultimately turn these men into devoted docile partners.<br /><br />Disregarding the connection between Twilight and 50 Shades, and regarding the novel as just an escapist read, could it be that James is capitalizing on this need of certain women to fantasize--overtake a man at his own game--and just simply writing an entertaining story?  Of course, Grey is an obviously damaged human spirit who will (in books two and three of the trilogy) eventually heal through the burning light of Ana's steadfast and trustful love.  That makes the outcome more reasonable.  Grey is wounded.  Ana nurtures; Ana heals.  If the novel is analyzed with this in mind, then perhaps it is not the quintessential piece of erotica that it is touted to be.  Sure, \\"50 Shades\\" contains many sexual interludes--some of which yawn with a ho-hum read-this-kind-of-stuff-before-and-skipped-over-it quality (heck--Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series has plenty of sexual liaisons, but no one is squawking about those thousand page tomes).  Giving Ms. James the benefit of the doubt, perhaps the actual theme of the novel is about making the right choice for oneself.  If Ana was a different sort of gal, right or wrong, maybe she would have picked another outcome for her shared life with Grey.  This Ana doesn't want to be submissive--she is true to herself and leaves.  How many other women or men would have just hunkered into a luxurious lifestyle?  Why let a cat-o-nine tail stop you from material success?<br /><br />Why is the novel being touted as [[ASIN:B003VPX1XY Lady Chatterley's Lover (The Unexpurgated Edition)]] for 2012?  Just to sell books!  Don't expect \\"[[ASIN:0802131786 Tropic of Cancer]]\\" or the famed \\"[[ASIN:0156260255 The Diary of Anais Nin, Vol. 1: 1931-1934]]\\" by the other \\"Ana,\\" Anais Nin.  \\"50 Shades\\" isn't about exploration--it's about trying out something alien in an attempt to understand another person--a psychologically damaged person.  And sadly, there are plenty of real people out there who are \\"fifty shades of Tom,\\" \\"fifty shades of Bill\\" or \\"fifty shades of Joey\\"--men who have been scalded emotionally and view the sexual act as a means of ultimate control where pleasure is expressed through pain.  Alas and sigh.  Way too complicated for me.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" an awful sophomoric attempt at erotica?  It is, what it is--a novel relating the experience of a young girl who falls in love with a man who has been emotionally hurt and can only release himself through the deliverance of pain. For sure, the novel contains sex that takes place in a room designed with the Marquis de Sade in mind.  However, James' Grey seems to be on the brink of understanding a different kind of love through the selfless ministrations of his Ana. Will she go back to him?  Will he be healed?  The answer to this is as simple as Twilight's \\"Who will Bella choose?\\" conundrum.  The key word here is \\"entertainment.\\"  Warning:  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" contains many sexually explicit scenes complete with crude language and hints at some sexual habits considered by some to be on the far side of wildness.

B000WC4AJI|1.0|I'm not commenting on the quality of the music itself but on the lack of \\"surround\\". I honestly don't know how this disc has surround in the title but it's the worst sacd I own in terms of rear channel sound. It's like they just used the front audio on the rear and lowered the volume an extreme amount, I put my ear on the back speaker and can barely hear anything. I think this is my first review on amazon and I only wrote it so others will know about the misleading title.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Received my cpu yesterday.  Pretty much immediately overclocked it.  I'm currently running at 4.5ghz with 1.32v for the cpu.  Temps are a good bit higher than on the sandy bridge CPUs but they are designed to be able to work at higher temps.<br /><br />There is some chance I could run it even faster since I have a high end watercooling system but I don't know why I'd need to.  If your car can go 350mph does it really make a difference if it can go 360mph?  It's already way faster than you need.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a really fun game that has enough levels to keep it entertaining for a while but it did reset my progress once.
0307730697|5.0|First and foremost, I'd like to thank the author for sharing with the world his phenominal book about Adam Brown, a true American hero, father, friend, husband, son, uncle and brother to his fellow SEALS.  Secondly, THANK YOU, ERIC, for including the comments made by one of the SEAL Team Six operators who was killed last August.  He was from my hometown, didn't know him or his remarkable family, attended his funeral service with his brother SEALS, and was humbled by the experience as I knew I was in the presence of greatness. I will never forget it, and was honored to attend his beautiful church service.<br /><br />I could not wait to receive this book on my Kindle when it was published.  This is truly one of the most AMAZING books I have ever read, right up there with LONE SURVIVOR, SEAL OF HONOR and SERVICE.  I read this book in a day and a half, I just could not put it down.  It is easy reading and will engross you page after page.  If there is one book that needs to be read, THIS IS IT.  Please read this book and enjoy the life of Adam Brown.  Then read the other three above which are on par with this one, each paying tribute to the SEALS mentioned in those books.<br /><br />Adam Brown was truly a one-of-a-kind man, the type of man who makes you proud to call him your friend.  Overcoming his demons with drug addiction and arrest, he finds God and his path in life by joining the United States Navy and after years of hard work and some possibly career-ending injuries, eventually becomes a proud and elite member of SEAL Team Six, the most prestigious Special Warfare group hands down.  I'm not going to rehash the story as so many other reviewers did, but I will say that EVERY high school student in the United States should be required to read this book and learn about Adam - the kind of selfless and God fearing man he was, generous to a fault, a true, kind and gentle friend who helped and cared about everyone who he crossed paths with in his short life, one of the best husbands and fathers I have ever read about, and an American hero.  If everyone could turn their life around and be just like Adam, the world would be a much better place.  I truly wished I had known him. My life would have been so much richer for it.<br /><br />Adam was a man of God, husband, father, son, US Navy SEAL, friend and HERO to all who knew him, as well as a TENDER WARRIOR. His faith in God never waivered, and carried him through his life.  Get to know him too by reading this book about Adam that will leave YOU, the reader, wondering why YOU aren't like Adam Brown.  This book is incredibly inspiring, and it just may make you strive to be a much better person like Adam was.  Even though the words THANK YOU are so inadequate, I THANK YOU, Adam, for your service, humanity and the kind and humbled person you were. I can't wait to meet you on the other side and shake the hand of the man who gave his life so selflessly for us Americans as well as protecting his fellow SEAL brothers in the heat of battle.  Heartfelt gratitude and prayers all around to everyone who contributed to this book, and there are many, but especially to Kelley, who my heart just bleeds for.  I will always pray for Kelley, Nathan and Savannah, Adam's entire family, Adam's brother SEALS, those SEALS who went before him as well as after, who made the ultimate sacrifice so I and my family can live freely in the United States of America, the greatest country in the world.  I just so wished there were more pages to this book, as I so hated to see it end, but will read it again and pass it on to my 17 year old son to show him how awe-inspiring Adam was.  I can only hope, wish and pray that my son turns out to be the kind of man Adam was.  Then I know my job as his Mom was well worth it.<br /><br />THANK YOU, Brown family and United States Navy SEALS (the BEST OF THE BEST!), for sharing your Adam with the world.  He will never be forgotten and will be truly missed.  GOD BLESS you always for protecting us.

0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell is an essayist who made his bones working for the New Yorker.  His first book, THE TIPPING POINT, proved to be a pretty nice commercial and critical success.  BLINK, the follow up, seems to stray away from the quality of his debut.  BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a pop-psychology book whose main argument is that human judgment is best when its immediate.  Gladwell's assertion is that our immediate reaction to events are often the most appropriate. The opposite claim is made as well -- we seem to make our worst judgments when we dwell on them and think about them critically.<br /><br />Gladwell always has an engaging and captivating voice.  In his essays, he has the ability to take some of the most seemingly mundane subjects and make them a fascinating topic to think about.  BLINK is no buck from this trend; it is very well written, and there's a lot here to think about.  The biggest problem with this book is the biggest problem with many of his essays, and in particular, his third book OUTLIERS; he works to prove his hypotheses rather than disprove other possible alternatives.  Gladwell uses an assortment of experiments to \\"prove\\" that our snap judgments are more valuable than otherwise, but he never really gives much credence to the myriad of evidence that suggests otherwise.  He gives a few examples, a few anecdotes, a few interesting stories, and that's all the evidence the reader should be expected to want, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately, BLINK proved to not be very convincing.  It did, however, prove to be a very fun and engaging book.  Even though I was not quite convinced, the ideas presented here are fun to think about.  I'd recommend BLINK to other fans of Gladwell's work (or popular science in general), but as always, take it with a grain of salt.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|\\"Remember Me?\\" is a good, classic beach read.  It's fun, with a few twists and turns.  Is it the best book Sophie Kinsella has written?  Probably not.  But it's filled with enough actual story so you don't feel like it's too rushed or too long.

0399536108|1.0|I did not even finish this book. After 180 pages i stopped wondering what the added value of the book was. Being half way i gave up, it was clear that it wasn't getting any better.<br /><br />I should have known from the beginning. When the author wrote about his concerns of getting good book reviews.<br />An important signal when people worry about getting good reviews it is usually crap! I saw it in hotels, restaurants, books... Good authors know they don 't need to worry about it!
0307730697|5.0|This is not a stereotypical &quot;military book&quot;.  This is a story about perseverance, redemption, faith and forgiveness.  And not just for Adam but his friends, parents and most of all his wife.  Adam's story shows that ANYONE can overcome ANYTHING and achieve ANYTHING with perseverance, support and most of all, faith in God.  Adam's journey to SEAL Team Six was anything but a conventional one but that journey forced many to refocus their lives in the right direction.<br /><br />There is an age old question of &quot;why does God allow bad things to happen?&quot;, especially bad things to good people. This story answers that question.  Through Adam's journey, many people were brought closer to God.  In his death, many more have been inspired and continue to be inspired to seek God and accept Christ as their Savior.<br /><br />As a SEAL, Adam saved countless lives through his direct involvement in a battle against terrorism.  His story, however, has saved souls for eternity.  He is a TRUE HERO in every aspect.

I think Ila is in a few shots, or at least a very pretty teen who looks like Sade texting nonstop. I got the feeling there is a lot of love, joking and support in this group. I adore the way her stage people hold her hand as she runs btw sets and the three second crew is an amazing talented bunch! I laughed, I cried and most of all I appreciate the intimate peek this group whom I have admired since I first saw them live back in the 1980's
0307951529|4.0|In today's  multi-million dollar deals, the notion of creating a legitimate company appears like a lark.<br /><br />Chris Guillenbeau is to be commended for putting his perspective in book form.  He lays out many practical scenarios of legitimate businesses for under $100.  The book will not bore you.  It is an easy read and has some nifty illustration.<br /><br />What makes to book fun while at the same time serious, is the concepts provided are not necessarily new.  It is the way Gullenbeau presents them which will make you say \\"Oh yeah\\" I thought about that!<br />Finally, the book is very contemporary, especially as technology has made start-ups \\"the thing to do\\" in 2012 and beyond.<br /><br />A good book to add to your library.  Nothing fancy, just basic information presented in a very practical format.  Good luck!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I picked this recommended book up on a lark. I was worried about it after the first book/chapter ended, but decided to continue since it was well written...  It was worth it.  I highly recommend this story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has been so helpful to me in the study of the scriptures. Our class has been studying the Gospels. Our work book requires both ASV or KJV to answer the questions, but I need a more updated version for easier comprehension. With this app I can toggle back and forth to the appropriate version very quickly and easily. I also use the search feature regularly for those Scriptures that I know are in there but just can't come up with the location  on my own. The Bible reading feature is also very helpful to keep me on track and the variety of types of reading programs is amazing. This is a great app that will help you know and understand the Scripture. I recommend it without reservation!
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Steven Wilson has done it again, except this time by collaborating with Opeth's own Mikael Akerfeldt. I've always been a huge fan of everything Steven Wilson from his solo works, to Porcupine Tree and Blackfield. The same goes for Mikael with Opeth and his participation in the death metal wonder Bloodbath. This long awaited collaborative project from whom I consider musical geniuses holds its own against all their other works. However, I consider this album uniquely unmistakable, as it's undeniably the work of Steven and Mikael.<br /><br />Put on a good pair of headphones, or turn up the record player because here we go...<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Drag the Ropes\\", at 9mins and 52 secs. It is here we are welcomed by Mikael's classic clean vocals. This particular track, with the layering of vocals and instrumentals, gives me a very 70's vibe. Do not let the length of this track, or any of the others for that matter, deter you from exploring  this album, because at no point will you be wondering \\"when is the next track going to start\\", but rather \\"the song is done?!\\"<br /><br />We continue on with the title track that brings us to a more calming, yet dark melodic place that makes you want to close your eyes to let the song take you where it may.<br /><br />The feel from the title track continues on through the album with, \\"Hag\\", and \\"Happy\\", with each song possessing and carrying on their own special melodies.<br /><br />We pick up the pace to feature \\"Lock Howl\\", with a more folk like melody that one can do nothing but enjoy.<br /><br />The album ends with a very special track: \\"Ljudet Innan\\". Here, we are lucky enough to be presented with vocals from Mikael that are unlike any we've heard. There is some lovely percussion that is brought in that just adds to the movement of the song. A soothing, brilliant end to an overall 10/10 record for me.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of Steven Wilson, a fan of Mikael Akerfeldt, or both, this is a DO NOT miss collaborative album that showcases the deep creativity of both artists. I believe their freedom to create what comes from their minds first and foremost is what inspires me and drives my love for their work.<br /><br />As a side note: this album is not going to be for everyone. You have to have a deep love for experimental music and an open mind. I can't compare it to anything to date because you just can't. All I can say is if you love music, the works of Steven Wilson and/or the works of Mikael Akerfeldt, this album should in NO way be a disappointment to you--SO BUY IT! 
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Read the book and then went out and saw the movie - book so much better.  Now to start book 2 hope its as good as book 1. Cannot wait
0439023513|3.0|I have to admit that I am still slogging through this book and I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it.  I felt like the first book started out so strong and then things started really going downhill when we hit this book.  It's very slow paced and the environs of the underground world are very sterile and boring.  I personally haven't spoken to one person who has liked this book.  I'm told that the later portion of the book is where the reader hits pay dirt.  Even so, they tell me that the ending is kind of disappointing.<br /><br />If I finish it, I will edit the review.  However, I felt there was some relevance in reporting the fact that it's such a chore to read and that's why I'm reviewing at this time.<br /><br />I'm a teacher, and my students tell me that I just have to stay the coarse to the end and then things get better.  That's not exactly the kind of endorsement that inspires me.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Great read, keeps you interested throughout, loved the characters and how the story  evolves.  The first time in many years I've read a entire series of books.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love this CD - great music to jam to in the car!  Have all Train's cd's and not one of them has been a disappointment!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Book one, two and three all read.  This is  as series that I could read over again. Shame the  movie does not live up to the expectations of book one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book forces you heart and mind to go dark places that as a parent you hope you will ne er have to go Iin reality. No other book I have read has taken me there. Great emotional and mental exercise.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book is excellent.  It is so much more than a story about horses.  Michael Morpurgo writes in detail about the many different owners and handlers this horse had and he does it cleverly through the eyes of Joey, the horse.  I read the book and saw the movie as well.  My favorite part was when Joey fled in terror from the sounds of war and became entangled in barbed wire that separated the Germans from the English and French.  The horrors of war were suddenly brought to a complete halt by both sides while volunteers from both sides of the barbed wire came out with wire cutters and cut the trapped horse free.  When they could not decide which side could claim Joey, they flipped a coin.  It was truly heart warming and so well written.  Once I started reading this story, I could not put it down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it but you need to know how to get out which is pretty easy.  you just get to the options screen
B007LB1O3I|4.0|A couple of REALLY good songs, which makes it worth it.  Most of them are decent.  Only one or two that I'm not crazy about.
B000002IU9|5.0|The CD arrived way earlier than estimated. It was in great shape, no scratches, and included all the artwork and lyrics that originally came with it. I got it for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of Manowar. He loved it. I would totally order from this person again.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|You can zoom in and move the puzzle around. Problems solved. Wonderful game, I love it. Challenging and fun to play.
1601251505|5.0|This tome has all the information for pathfinder organized beautifully. I know all the pathfinder rules are available online for free, but this book was worth every penny. The artwork is wonder. The book has great spell listings and class breakdowns. If you're a beginner or a long time DM, you should own this book. If only to look through the great artwork.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so fun, it's like sudoku with pictures. I have been playing the heck out of it. I'm so lucky to have gotten it on the free day, but now I would pay for it if I had to.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Very good integration with web applications like Garmin Connect and RunKeeper, easier to use than expected. No reason to pay a lot more for the fancier models with touchscreen.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|It's a bit more electronic that my usual taste in music, but it's smooth and I really enjoy having it mixed in with my other MP3's.  This album is well worth a listen if you are an old school alt fan.
0345803507|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful!  This ending to the first two books in the Trilogy was just as I'd hoped it would be.  Yes, these books are over the top, but it is only FICTION!  No, this Trilogy isn't for someone looking for a literal, non-fiction read!!!  As for me, I read it as the fantasy that it is and it was time well spent!!!
B007P6VM04|5.0|Personally, I don't think the 5 additional songs on the Smash Soundtrack Deluxe Edition add much to the 13 numbers on the one available here. After viewing the complaints about what's on the CD and what isn't, etc., I've come to the conclusion thatI guess I must just have a tin ear...I love, love, love listening to this CD. I burned a copy for myself to keep in my car...added my two favorites, \\"History is Made at Night\\" and \\"Let Me be Your Star\\" as the 1st two tracks leading into the original CD (wish I had added \\"Stand\\", too...guess I'll have to burn another). Now I don't have to bother fiddling around to hear my favorites more than once while driving to work. I'm not very technically savvy, don't have iPod or MP3 player, but this old grandmother is enjoying this CD immensely.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After flying through book 1, I couldn't wait to delve into this one!!!  I must admit I had gotten over the shock  in Book 1. Honestly, I did skim over some of the more graphic details in this book. I notice some keep dwelling on the sex. As a mature grandmother, I didn't have to read every word to get the idea. I loved the fantasy and plot!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is just ok. simple grafics its kind of simplistic but overall I like the game. got hard a little fast. I recommend the Price is right. la Kala
1401937268|5.0|These cards are beautiful, light and airy:)<br />If you love angels and positive messages these cards are the cards for you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. some of the levels get real hard though. but its still worth it. great game. get it now.
B007SGM084|1.0|Seriously?  I adore my Kindle but you're charging far too much for a downloadable book!  Amazon or the publisher really need to review their pricing of ebooks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised some games were challenging than others but really enjoy all the games ive unlocked do far
B00198X0VS|5.0|Men In Black II was far superior to the first one. Barry Sonnenfeld really ramped up the comedy, the action and the fun. Truly I don't understand the poor rating for this film. Men In Black is suppose to be comical, it is suppose to be fun and entertaining. I feel like Men In Black I gets a better rap because of the elitists who just have this mind set that the original film has to be the best. Take Men In Black II for what it is suppose to be a campy, funny and entertaining sci-fi thrill ride. In my opinion Men In Black II was much better than the first Men In Black and has everything the first one had but more.
0307352145|4.0|The general consensus is that if a person is quiet, or not very talkative in a group setting, then they are not the ones in control, or don't have the best ideas.  However, Susan Cain goes to great lengths to discuss introversion as a cultural, psychological, sociological, and personal phenomenon.  I love looking at things that way.  She shows how it is the particular insights of people who are quiet enough to study and articulate problems and circumstances that have the power to change things and make big things happen.  Unfortunately, our culture is designed to encourage and reward extroverts and their contributions, which may not necessarily be the most well thought out or beneficial for society.  The ramifications for this are also explored in detail.<br /><br />One of the most interesting threads for me was the discussion of how churches are set up and geared almost exclusively toward extroverts.  One example--the 'meet and greet' time that is part of the worship service of churches all over.  I HATE this.  Absolutely hate it.  And it has nothing to do with being an introvert.  I just know that it makes all kinds of people uncomfortable, and gives them yet another reason to check out of church.  I mean, seriously, how does that make people feel comfortable and welcome?  If people want to talk to or 'visit with their neighbor', then they will make a point of doing on their own, not because someone in the front instructed everybody to do it at the specified time.<br /><br />Quiet was an interesting book, and one that I think is of particular importance for people in organizational leadership.  Diverse voices may be quiet, but those voices are important nonetheless.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah for review purposes.  No other compensation was received.
B006ZT47O0|3.0|After the (mostly) magisterial opus, \\"Design Your Universe\\", it was difficult to imagine a topper.<br />This is a competent enough offering,  but I would have given four and a half for \\"Design..\\", and three and a half for this.<br />It is almost as though Marc and Simone and the lads had deliberately not trodden their previous paths.<br /><br />There is less attention to form, though all is played admirably well.<br />There are still the Cookie Monster vocals, without which we could well do.<br /><br />Ms Simon's vocals are often strained, and I disagree with those who say she is singing a little lower in her range. I believe that she is singing too much at the top end, with less dynamism, less drama and sometimes loses her previously extraordinary control.<br /><br />A couple of tracks seem to begin in a \\"Tides of Time\\" style, only to drift into some soppiness or abject boredom...as though it was too hard to have another go at such a sublimely magnificent song.<br /><br />It was too much to hope for anything near as good as its predecessor, but many bands, later deified, had had the same problem.<br /><br />I look forward to a change in direction and some sparkle and enthusiasm with their next effort.<br /><br />So, if you know little of Symphonic Metal, it might be a reasonable intro, but if given a choice of Epica works, go for \\"Design..\\" or even the the three before that
B007SGM084|5.0|I was engaged from beginning to end. Every woman should read this book> Two of my friends from work have started the series and love it too. I was hooked from page one until the last chapter. Actually disappointed when I finished trilogy. Wanted more!!
B007JM4CWY|3.0|nice concept but as game gets more complex the spaces are too small.  frustrating enough that I elected not to play.  too bad because I like the actual game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. i love this app. it is awesome.....and it has fun games. and a lot of games.... I like how u can earn points to unlock games.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good and simple game to kill yours free time<br />interesting level<br />thank you for this game<br />it is very nice that this game is free
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i love how it incorporates Oregon trail features. that was my fav game to play as a kid. the hunting is hard to pinpoint tho. I keep hitting other stuff and using energy.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I used to be addicted to Sudoku but that got very boring after a while. CrossMe is a different game but from the same vein.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll be sucked in and wearing out your phone battery.  Highly recommended!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|So much fun!!!!!!  Ive been playing it ever since I got it.  I would recomened it for everyone.  SOOOOOOO ADDICTING!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!
B007HO392S|4.0|First of all, let me say that I love Carrie Underwood and have purchased every previous album of hers on the very first day of its release.  This time around, I did listen to the free stream for a week many times over hoping to love this album, but it never happened.  I still purchased it during the first week it was released (not the first day, however) and for the most part, I'm happy with it.  Carrie's voice sounds spectacular.  It has never sounded better, in my opinion.  Also, the production is excellent.  And there are some awesome songs on here.  My absolute favorite is \\"Forever Changed.\\"  In fact, I couldn't get through the song without crying the first five or six times I heard it.  Beautiful!  Carrie's voice sounds so tender on this ballad.  I also love \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" and am really pleased that Carrie co-wrote this.  Great job there.  I also regularly listen to \\"Good Girl\\" (even though it reminds me of \\"Cowboy Casanova, Pt. 2\\"),  \\"Blown Away,\\" and \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" (even though this does remind me somewhat of music that would have been played during an action sequence of a 70s movie [\\"... two black Cadillacs ...\\"]).  :-)<br /><br />Having said all that, most of the songs I just skip over (depending on my mood) and that has never happened before with a Carrie album.  \\"See You Again\\" and \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" aren't bad at all, but the rest of them?  I could take them or leave them with the exception of \\"One Way Ticket\\" which I really dislike because it reminds me of something Kenny Chesney would do and decided not to at the last minute.  And is it just me, or does it seem odd and humorous hearing Carrie Underwood say, \\"Lick it?\\"  LOL, maybe it IS just me, but I find it pretty funny every time I hear this song.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I still love Carrie and will continue to buy her albums and see her in concert.  She's amazing and a hard worker and I think everyone should be allowed a misstep every now and then.  I don't think it will affect herpopularity at all.  I rate this a very generous four stars.
B000FC11A6|4.0|Like Gene Wolfe, Stephenson writes without regard to the reader's vocabulary or whims which makes the story truly fascinating at each turn of the page. Detailed and often verbose, Stephenson is not afraid to explore seemingly unimportant facts through often hilarious tangents which never failed to have me laughing uproariously. While the plot weaves in and out of 2 different time periods, the story never gets confusing or hard to follow. This is a good read for literary-minded readers (or readers who want to be literary-minded).
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a brilliant puzzle game which I like better than sudoku, its implemented very well on a touchscreen, recommend.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I have always loved Rick Riordan and always will.I definently do not agree with anybody wo says this book is boring or does not like it.
B005L38QK2|5.0|I'm not going to write a novel of a review just because - to put it simply - it works perfectly. The buttons aren't horribly placed, and after a few days of practice you shouldn't have any problems getting used to it. Mainly I wanted to state that the problem with the firmware that most people were having appears to be patched, I haven't had any problems with it, so don't hesitate to buy it now if that's your concern. Happy Gaming.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|The first two Portishead releases are genre-defining classics of trip-hop. This 'Third' release is a stripped down affair that is missing the cool beats that make the music so listenable and entertaining. Beth's vocals are beautiful and haunting as always, but without the beats I am just bored to tears and it makes me fall asleep. Just not something I'm into.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have been having so much fun with this!  Have to force myself to put my Kindle Fire down.  LOL<br /><br />The tutorial is not very clear- but once I started playing it made sense.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|While I concur that this will be on my summer playlist, as I'm enjoying it immensely, I just can't give it Five Stars.  The musical production of Soulsavers is outstanding.  What a find for me. I'm going to pick up their earlier stuff now.<br /><br />And Dave Gahan's voice is outstanding.  Even knowing through these nearly 30 years of DM fandom that he had a great voice I don't think I've ever heard it so well isolated as it is here.<br /><br />My issue, which held back that last start, is with the lyrics.  I guess I'm the odd-man-out on these.  I think they're just okay.  There are some great runs...but they end up imperfect in the end.  I'm not going to bore with details but that's just my perspective.<br /><br />Still, what a great album and it's spurring me to go back and check out Soulsaver's previous stuff, as well as Dave Gahan's solo stuff as well.
0670023329|5.0|I could not put this book down!! It was engaging. It is amazing that these camps are still in operation even right now today!!  Read this book, awareness of this horrific practice needs to be made!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Unfortunately, I am reading this book because it is now relevant to me. My beautiful, vivacious and much-loved 35 year old daughter, with three children and loving husband, has recently been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphona. This illness has quietly been infiltrating her body with no outward signs or discomfort, until recently when she noticed a painless swelling in her groin. When she discovered a lump in her armpit she went to the doctor, who also discovered further lumps. Within a week or two, our lives have been altered. She is now undergoing chemotherapy with second dose coming up. Yesterday she informed me her hair has now started to fall out in clumps. Her strength thru out this journey is nothing short of inspirational. This book was referred to me by a friend who was listening to an interview (synchronicity!). I am a firm believer that there is much more to us and to life as we perceive it so the book did not have anything new to reveal to me. However, it has helped me to cope with the impact of this illness and to focus on my daughter being well, not ill.  I see no other possibility than that she will be returned to full health. This book will certainly be of comfort to anyone who is facing this challenge. It is a book of hope.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Touchscreen makes this game easy to play. Love it. There are a few ads on the free version but it does not interfere with game. Excellent;)
B007G92QGO|4.0|i really enjoyed this book.  I read it in three days and couldnt put it down.  i would recommend this book and i am now looking forward to reading other books by the same author

B00004LN16|4.0|This may not be AC/DC's best, but the first half the album is fantastic. The second half not as good, but not bad either.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Being a person who reads a lot of fantasy/science fiction novels, I was pleasantly surprised at the twists and turns of the plot in this series. Every time the story seems to be wrapping up on one side, it unravels in a unique way. I haven't finished it yet (really long!) but I am afraid it will go the way of the TV series \\"Lost\\" and wrap everything up at the last minute... which isn't quite as satisfying as having small things wrap up slowly along the way. The books start out identical to the TV show, but diverge so the story becomes a lot more intriguing.<br /><br />Overall, really good series with excellent plot development.
0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey writes an honest and funny book. I enjoyed it, although it got repetitive and long towards the end. She seems to have a depth and insight which came out in bits, (ie. when she discusses the difference betwen male and female comedy writers) but then she promptly apologizes for them. Yet, they were my favorite parts. I guess she knows her comedy audience, but I am even more interested in her insight. All and all, I liked this book.

1932100660|1.0|After I read this \\"biased\\" book I went on a \\"vegan rampage\\" and immediately gave up all meat and dairy products (basically went on a whole food vegan diet)for approximately 3 months.  My results were HORRENDOUS.... Within three months my thyroid went downhill, my hormones were unbalanced, my iron levels plummeted, and most importantly.... I FELT LIKE CRAP!!!  I had NO energy AT ALL!!!  Thank GOD I went to a homeopathic doctor that told me the facts and the truth about what a vegan diet would do to me long-term (plus I'm O blood type and I have never done well on a high carb-high grain diet... I do much better with NO grains honestly).<br /><br />GET THIS... When I went on a low-carb HIGH ANIMAL FAT (I use REAL butter in EVERYTHING now) diet my bad cholesterol DROPPED by 68 points and I lost the 30 pounds!!!<br /><br />This biased vegan \\"study\\" was NOT the answer for me!<br /><br />The best thing I ever did was get off of gluten, get back on grass fed beef, free range turkey and chicken, raw cows and goat milks, plus fresh fruits and veggies!<br /><br />It's kinda simple really :-) And we have those canines (y/k the teeth to TEAR MEAT?!), umm, well, because were BORN as \\"OMNIVORES\\" NOT Herbivores!!!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend reading Denise Minger's scientific research and highly detailed documented rebuttal of this book!  If you do, it will PROVE to you that this book is completely biased towards the vegan agenda.  A vegan diet is not for everyone (well, for most people actually).  Just do your research and you'll understand \\"WHY!\\"
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|The movie was great, but the sound quality was not the best. I turned my own personal system up to the max and it was still not easy to hear.

0345803485|2.0|This must be one of the top ten worst books I have read to the end. The story should be mature. However it is over simplification to the point of immaturity. Makes me think of it as a pornographic Judy Bloom story
B005HEH9XA|5.0|Watching Enterprise all the way through for the first time, and this is one of the best episodes in the series so far.
0375842209|4.0|I have recently read The Book Thief at school.  I was not sure what to expect from the book, all I knew was that it was somehow related to WWII in Nazi Germany.  I am not a big fan of reading, but this book really interested me.<br /><br />  The book is a historical fiction, and I guess it could be considered a drama too.  It is pretty dark at some points, but it is funny or happy at other times.  The book seems to revolve around a beautiful and ugly theme.  It shows the ugly of Nazi Germany, the Nazis and Hitler, as well as the beautiful of Nazi Germany, the people that do not support Hitler and the innocent victims of the Holocaust.<br /><br />  It is narrated by Death.  Death tells the story from an omniscient point of view.  It is a perfect book for Death to narrate, considering it takes place during WWII in Nazi Germany.  Death remembers certain events with colors, for example during a battle scene, Death remembers red.  He is humorous at some points and is also sarcastic.  This lightens the mood, considering the book can be depressing and dark at times.  Death sees the beautiful and ugly in people, but prefers to find the beautiful.  He says that humans misunderstand him.  Despite what you might think, Death does not like war and really just needs a vacation.  He says he is more human than people think.<br /><br />  Even though you only hear from Death, the main character is Liesel Meminger, the book thief.  She moves in with a foster family when she is nine after her younger brother dies.  Her foster mom is Rosa Hubermann, a foul mouthed but loving mother.  Rosa is strict, but at the same time she loves Liesel and just wants the best for her.  Her foster father is Hans Hubermann.  He is an accordion player, who is addicted to cigarettes.  Hans is against the Nazi party and tries to avoid joinging it.  Liesel likes Hans better and finds him easier to get to know than Rosa.<br /><br />  Throughout the novel, Liesel acquires books by either stealing them or getting them as gifts.  Hans teaches Liesel how to read a little with the first book that she steals.  Her love of books causes her to steal more, and she meets and befriends people while doing so.  One of those friends is Rudy.  Rudy is Liesels age, and is her neighbor.  Rudy falls in love with Liesel and is always trying to get Liesel to love him back.  Another friend that Liesel has is Max.  Max is Jewish and hides with the Hubermanns during the Holocaust.  He writes Liesel books and they together realize how powerful words are.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the Book Thief.  It can be sad, but it really makes you think.  It is interesting how much a young girl from a small German town sees in just a couple of years.  The books theme of the beautiful and ugly is very fitting considering its setting.

B005FPT2E0|5.0|Great deluxe edition of never before seen footage. Nice packaging and nice to see George Harrison material being put out. It's been years since George has been gone and there has not been a lot of \\"never been released\\" material put out by \\"non-bootleg\\" record companies. Will be nice to see fututre releases being put out! Thank you Olivia Harrison for keeping George's music out there!!!

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is a wonderful masterpiece full of history, family, friends, and death. It is a historical nonfiction story about a girl named Liesel Meminger. The tone of this story is depressing and bleak but has short windows of hope and happiness. The point of view of the novel is from Death's point of view. He tells the story of Liesel as he is taking the souls of dead people around her. Because Death is the narrator, the mood of the story is obviously very sad and solemn. The main characters of this novel are Liesel Meminger (the book thief), Hans and Rosa Hubermann, Max Vandenburg, and Rudy Steiner. Liesel is the foster daughter of Hans and Rosa and goes to live with them after her brother dies and her mother gives her away to the Hubermanns. Max is a Jewish fist fighter that is hiding from the Nazis in the Hubermann's basement and he soon becomes friends with Liesel. The intended audience of this novel is everyone. Everybody can easily read and enjoy this novel without any problems because it is so gripping and easy to keep up with. I loved this book because of the historical background and the story within it. This is the first story that I have read that was from this distinct point of view and that contained such a strong message all throughout the novel. I agree that words can be a truly powerful thing to use. Liesel used words throughout the book because she read many books and that is one of the things that helped her pull through such a rough time. Words can be especially powerful and this story is perfect proof of it. I specifically liked how the author compared Liesel and Hitler with the way that they use their words because Hitler was such a masterful speaker and that is the reason that he was able to have so many followers. By using this comparison, Zusak is saying that Liesel is just as powerful. The author did a magnificent job of writing this novel because he wrote through every aspect of literature. This book could not be improved in any way because it is such a masterpiece already.
076790592X|4.0|A wonderful story that helps to clarify just what is important in our lives and how we tend to focus on all the wrong things.  I was particularly impressed with the development and growth of the relationship between the two main characters. The book is a little short, and in some chapters a little more detail would be nice, but an overall excellent read.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire. I use it everywhere but one of the biggest thigs I use it for is to stream video while I am busty at my desk, typing away on my laptop. Before I got this case with it's great stand, i usually just used items from my desk to prop the kindle up so I could see it - things like my cell phone or coffee cup - I'm sure you can see right away the problems with that!<br />With this case I can easily fold the cover back and utilize the nice little stand, lock the screen into position and I'm good to go - whenever I want to drink my coffee I don't have to readjust my Kindle.<br />Another nice feature for those of us who like to take our Fire with us is the little pockets inside that hold cards like my library card, my coffee card and a folded $20 in case I find a garage sale!<br />The only down side to this case that I could think of is that the cover needs some kind of elastic strap that will hold it shut when I toss it in my purse - right now I use a rubber band and while that works, it doesn't look to pretty.<br />All in all this case is a value for the price and does what it says it will do which makes it a great deal in my world!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great play. Must have. There tons of levels and it is a very beautiful app. Got to have it! Yup
1849514003|5.0|This book covers techniques that go beyond the basics in cocos2d programming. If you find that often you can't achieve something you would like or it gets alot of investigation and googling, this book will most certainly help. A must have.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I installed on my Kindle Fire and played 3 puzzles.  When I tried to open it next time it wouldn't open so I uninstalled and installed again. I worked one puzzle and closed.  It wouldn't open the next time i tried so I again uninstalled and now it will not reinstall.  That's too bad because I liked the way it worked.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The game is good for exercising your brain.  The puzzles increase in  difficulty at a good rate.  The only negative is a small one in that you have to zoom in on the bigger boards to get accurate placement of the marks, which can cause you to lose track of the numbers on the edges.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is so easy to use.  It is easy to move from one Scripture to another.  I love being able to compare verses in different versions.  There are a lot of devotionals and reading plans.  It even will send email reminders so you won't forget.  Awesome!

B004J4WN0I|4.0|Hearne does a nice job with urban fantasy.  His ancient druid fits amazingly well into modern Tempe.  His setting is vividly and accurately described, his storyline is solid, and his characters are well-drawn and enjoyable (especially Oberon).  I loved the bonus story set in the Kaibab.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

B0000C7PSW|5.0|Up until recently, i had never heard a Rufus Wainwright album. I purchased his latest offering, \\" Out Of The Game \\" after seeing him on TV, singing the title track. I had to check out his back catalogue.....<br />....well, what a joy i found ! \\" Want One \\" created an immediate impression, so much so, i've ordered copies for friends. Everyone should hear this masterpiece ! It's definitely in my all time top 10 favourite albums.<br />From first note to last, you're taken on an emotional journey, that takes you from joy to sadness...and anything inbetween. The ballads / slower songs, remind me of one of my all time favourite artists, Billy Joel...and Rufus ( like Billy ) is a great lyricist too. Imaginitive & unique.<br />All the tracks are very special. \\" Dinner At Eight \\" is absolutely beautiful, and makes me want to cry.<br />I would urge anyone to add this cd to their collection, if you don't, you're really missing out on something wonderful !
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Seems to be great but others reviews have alerted me to a possible threat masked within. I would like more information on how to protect myself on my Kindle Fire.

030746363X|4.0|Really honest self help guru Tim Ferris did a wonderful job with this book. Following his advice and picking and choosing some of his unusual recommendations can quite honestly change your life. Much of the information is regurgitated from his blog, but in a much more concise form. As an avid blog reader I really enjoy his website but to be honest this book is a more helpful medium for fitness. Finding info on his website is an exercise in and of itself.<br /><br />Many of his techniques are outlandish but he backs it up with science where he can and admits the rest may or may not work. Other than the sex chapter which pretty much says little to nothing that could help you unless you live near the school he recommends this is one of the better fitness books and easily one of the best self help books in years.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|In short, this book is nothing new but I wish like hell I had it 5 years ago. The author admits this and he is able to filter out all the BS in just under 200 pages. I really found it interesting how he explained carbs....I have always struggled understanding them. Whether you do the work out or not (which seems legit so I will probably try it even though I wasn't planning on it) you will most def benefit from this one. I am a trainer and study exercise and health science at a University; I will be recommending this one!
0375842381|2.0|Like many others, I read Pullman's trilogy and thought it was well-written and imaginatively conceived - but unlike anyone else, seemingly, I was amazed by the misogyny represented by Mrs. \\"sleep-my-way-to-the-top\\" Coulter and, worse, the way Lyra defers timidly to Will as soon as he shows up - in HER world, no less - in The Subtle Knife. What gives, Philip? How is poor C.S. Lewis' sexism of the '50s worse than yours now? Your sexism is much harder to defend.<br /><br />I know Mr Pullman always loudly despises any British children's writer who is more popular than he is (who is also dead and can't defend themselves), but really... asking kids today to read Swallows and Amazons? Talk about dry and dated! His crude criticisms of Blyton only make Pullman look small.<br /><br />As for JK Rowling, sneering at Blyton for not having sexuality in her '40s books for children is just plain dumb. You can't be superior about it when NO ONE would have put sex in a children's book back then! And as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't a change for the better. Kids today have enough to deal with without growing up too fast in their fairy tale/adventure stories too.
B0071MV540|1.0|What a disappointing movie. The cast led me to believe i would be seeing an interesting movie about a heist. i love heist movies. However, this one was pretty stupid. The level of humour was elementary school level. Hated the entire movie. Sorry to down this movie so much but it failed.
0345803485|5.0|Once you get over the shock factor this is a great book and a great love story.  I read it in two days and had to start the second book immediately after finishing this one so I could find out what happens.  This book is not for everyone but is much more than the \\"mommy p**n\\" it has been labeled.
B00785P2QC|4.0|love this qame just wish we could rotate the houses and statues. also hats the invest points never have enough to get things done unless you buy more this sucks
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the trailer of the movie and thought instead of watching the movie I would just read the books, which was the best. It really dosent pull any punches. I know a Vietnam Veteran and the ending of the book is exactly how they all had to learn to deal with their new view of life. Fighting for their lives and having to kill or be killed, loosing their loved ones while their serving their country, you have to remember they didn't have a choice either, they were drafted. It was an amazing story, I was sad, but it is in truth a type of reality that our service members live with every day. Gives me Great respect for such insight.. Well written and I'm not going to see the movie. I own the best there is the books.
B005PK1G76|5.0|we bought this to go on our new britax b-nimble stroller- its great!  I can only say great things about this product.  We keep it on the stroller and have no problems even folding the stroller up with it still attached.  very helpful and can hold quite a bit!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Is there such a thing as having too much fun? This is it. very addictive. I play it everyday and Love it!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|You know those movies that are even better the second time you see them? This is one of them. The first half of the movie seemed gratuitous and shallow, but as the story progresses, it gets deeper and more meaningful. So by the end, you are deeply immersed and moved. The second time you watch it, you are immersed from the start and notice small things that were shallow and gratuitous the first time round that now have deep meaning. The inclusion of humor (however racist and sometimes hurtful) makes this movie well balanced. I was rotflmao at the barber shop scene. The fact that it looked ad-libbed made it more real for me. Another reviewer said Walt hated everybody. That is right ... not so much a biased racist as a hater of everyone ... even the white kid who was trying to emulate the hommies. He respects hard work, no matter what your race, and I suspect many \\"racists\\" are this way and fall for believing in only the stereotypes. I know a few myself. Eastwood is a master film maker and this is one of his best.
B004EI924E|5.0|Loved the movie, funny, exciting and kept us on the edge or our seats.  A great flic for an evening of fun.
B00633W614|3.0|I love Archer and his books.  If you read the first in this trilogy, this really is a must read.  However, it is disappointing.  It really seemed like a hybrid of about 5 other books by him that I read.  The plot is generally predictable and everything seems to tidy up nicely.  This has the same basic format as the first book, you see events through the eyes of several characters.  However, this book the plot lines don't criss-cross much.  Each person has their own experience and you aren't seeing the same event through the eyes of 3 or 4 different people.<br /><br />The book isn't bad, but just lacks a lot.  Honestly, I can't imagine where the 3rd book goes.  The thing I hate about this book is it clearly was to close the events from the first book while leaving you with a cliff hanger to buy the 3rd book.  And the cliff hanger is weak at best.
0618680004|3.0|It's no wonder the \\"London Review of Books\\" titles their review \\"Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching\\" [...]    Mr. Dawkins is certainly a professional in his field, so I kept in mind that his work would possibly be limited to a specific vantage point. Yet, even from this narrow field of vision, he undermines his remaining authority by flippantly throwing all people of faith into a mold. (as if any adherence to strong rationalism doesn't also require a bit of faith) The arguments in his volume, complete with a mocking tone in some areas, goes downhill from there.    Either Mr. Dawkins views his audience as ignorant, or he himself honestly doesn't know what he doesn't know. However, if you are curious and desire to read a book of one-sided propaganda, I'd recommend \\"God is not Great\\" by Christopher Hitchens, since Mr. Hitchens is the considerably more eloquent and entertaining writer.    Or you can make Mr. Dawkins book more enjoyable by changing the cover to read, \\"THE LUCAS DELUSION, BY HAN SOLO\\". The arguments would work with only a minor bit of tweaking.

0525423656|3.0|Matched was great- it moved quick and everything about The Society was interesting. The characters themselves were interesting, and I loved how everything was falling together; It reminded me of a non-violent Hunger Games, in a way.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />Crossed, on the other hand, was EXTREMLY slow... it moved almost in a forceful tone; without much depth into the thoughts of characters. I got so bored that I just replaced the characters in the book to characters from Final Fantasy XIII. It made it a little more interesting... but not much.<br /><br />I wish the book Crossed was taken into a different direction, and I was really dissapointed with the way it was  presented.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first book, but I will not eargly await to read the third, Reached.<br />Although I like the cover...

B003IKMR0U|5.0|The game is simple, fast, and fun.<br /><br />But as with most games the more you put into it the more you will get out of it. My friends and I do play-by-play commentary (ESPN style) \\"He goes to the cup lets see the hand.... Well looks like he has a \\"Streetlight\\" (1 green, 1 yellow, 1 red dice) lets see how he rolls..... OH NO looks like he has the dreaded triple shot! And that folks takes young Mr. Sterling out of the game. His competitors must have a sigh of relief, but with all things Zombie those respites are often short lived, as next up to the cup is Josh, let's see what he pulls....\\"<br /><br />This game is easy to pick up and works great with a group up to 5-6. We also have added our own rule \\"The Lightning Round\\"<br />- The round is only played if all players die before 13 brains.<br />- In this round each player rolls until he dies (3 shots) trying to overtake the player with the highest score, by adding any new brains to their current score.<br />- The player with the highest score entering the round goes last in the round. If at the end of the round no one has overtaken the high score then the player with the high score wins. If a player has over taken them for high score, then the former highest scorer attempts to retake the title, adding any new brains to their current stock.
0525423281|5.0|I've been dying to read this since I finished Anna and the French Kiss back in August 2011. I won this in a Twitter giveaway from Andra and it took a while to get here because of the stupid mail people, and I was SO excited to have it in my possession. But once I finally had it, I couldn't read it! I wanted to SO badly, but I wanted to save it for a time that I got into a major reading slump. Which, I did! And I joined a  read-a-thon and read it during that time and it definitely got me out of my slump, though now after I've read it nothing else compares and it really sucks!<br /><br />It took me a couple of pages to really get into this new character. You can obviously tell Stephanie Perkins wrote this book, she has a certain unique voice to her that makes you fly through the pages of her books before realizing you're already a hundred pages in. But this wasn't Anna, and I was worried she wouldn't be able to compare to her. Which, she doesn't. I do like Anna better. But I absolutely LOVE Lola. She's definitely unique! I'd definitely want to be her friend.<br /><br />It was hilarious when Anna and St. Clair pop up in this book. At first when I saw the name Anna and the whole thing with Anna's banana necklace, it didn't click for some reason. I was too into the story to notice. But when I read St. Clair's name, oh boy. I freaked out and had to go back a page or so to read where Anna showed up again. And then I was all, \\"Yay! Anna and St. Clair.\\" and gosh, they are SO freaking cute. And hilarious. Just makes me so jealous!<br /><br />I love my husband to death, but sometimes I'd love to go back to fresh new love where we wanted to be EVERYWHERE the other way. Sooo cute! But anyway, the characters are so real in this book. For a while Lola was annoying me a bit, I was screaming at her asking her what the hell was up with her with Max. Yes, he's a hot rockstar. BUT he wasn't right for her. I'm not going to go into anymore details about that....<br /><br />But, oh, Cricket. He's so awkward and cute and makes you want to just snuggle up to him and give him a HUGEEE hug. *le sigh* I'm SO happy with the ending!<br /><br />Overall, yes, I do love Anna and the French Kiss more. But this definitely was an amazing read and definitely one of my favorite contemporarys. I can't wait for the next companion novel. I'm going to be sad about getting into yet another characters head, but I know it will be great. =D Don't stop writing, Stephanie! You're amazing! I recommend this cute companion novels to EVERYONE! Especially if you're a hopeless romantic and you love contemporary romances. *Sighs with stupid grin on my face*et.

0345803485|1.0|There isn't much more that can be said that hasn't already been said on here.  I heard it was poorly written, but still wanted to see what all the hype was about. Honestly I just don't get it!  Erotica is not a new genre... why is THIS one so popular?!?  The repetitiveness drove me insane and the characters just aren't even that interesting.
B007HO392S|5.0|as usual Carrie Rocked this CD, I preordered before I even knew what was on it, since I have all her other CD's and I just had to have this one.

1741797802|2.0|My wife and I are currently using the LP India (2011ed. paperback) as our guidebook wandering through India.  Traveling through the south currently and all prices are minimum 20-30% higher than quoted in the LP for all accommodation.<br /><br />In less than 10 months?!?!? I was confused.<br /><br />I've shown the 2011 ed. book with the prices quoted to hotels/guesthouses and have been told either that they'd put their prices up in August/September/October or that they'd written the LP informing them of price changes or moving location, but had had no reply and by the reading of the current version, no adjustment in the book.  These prices were confirmed impossible or ridiculous by local friends of mine.  \\"that's two years ago prices, man...\\"<br /><br />LP can't predict cycling power 'load shedding' (leading every hotel to need their own generator) implemented by local governments after their publish date, nor can they be expected to keep up with every change on the ground.  I wouldn't have expected them to.  But with so many (after 3 weeks in the South, we have not found even a single place to stay with the LP's quoted price range) I became suspicious.<br /><br />I looked through someone's cast-off South India guide from 2005 in one of the places we stayed, flipping through the places we planned to visit and felt a bit like I was having deja vu.  It seemed like I'd read a few things before... when I compared with the 2011 India guide, I found several write-ups were VERBATIM!  Others were word for word, but in the India guide had been shortened and didn't contain the entire text from the South India guide.<br /><br />Everybody's gotta make a living and we all take some short-cuts, but I feel like the LP has really dropped the ball on this one.  India changes quickly.  Fair enough.  Surely that means it warrants NEW material in a new edition or some kind of qualifier about prices etc.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm supposed to \\"trust\\" about the LP here.  Using theirguide, we set a budget that is proving wildly insufficient to the time we've planned to be here. Probably serves me right for relying so much on one source.  Lesson learned. I'll go with the Rough Guide or something else next time. And use more free online resources.<br /><br />Thanks for very little LP.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|While I may be in the minority here, I must say I did not enjoy this book. While I commend the author for her success, it was not a success for me. I'm one that is usually short and to the point, so here it goes.<br /><br />I found the characters undeveloped and unrealistic. I had a hard time caring about any of them. The relationships were unrealistic and felt forced to me. There were quite a few things missed in the editing process, and though I don't let that bother me usually, it took away from the flow of the story in this instance. I had to read over a few parts in order to decipher what the author was trying to say.<br /><br />Bottom line, I didn't enjoy the book.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|From the day I got my Blu ray player, this was the set I was most anxious to have, however because it's kind of pricey, I didn't get it for several months. Now that I have it, I feel like I shouldn't have bothered. There are serious problems with these disks. Audio drop outs, in some places it happens every 10 or 15 seconds. The sound just goes away for a while. You have to pause the movie and wait for it to \\"catch up\\" and then start playing it again. This happens with the movies and also with the commentary tracks. None of my other blu ray disks has this problem. In looking online, I see that I'm also not the only person having this issue. There are several solutions I've seen posted, but none of them worked.<br />  As for bonus features, apart from the unlistenable commentary tracks, they have also decided, for reasons that I can't understand, to not include any of the excellent making of documentaries that were included with the DVDs, and frankly, when it comes to the prequels, the making of films were the only thing worth watching from the DVDs. Instead, there is a selection of old made for TV documentaries made when the original trilogy was released. They are grainy as hell and look like they were taped from someone's VHS copy using a video camera pointed at a TV. There are a few features showing shots of some of the models and matte paintings used, which are nice, though some have short videos to talk about them and some don't. And unless I'm missing it, not one of them is about the Millenium Falcon? We get the hand puppet of the slug, but not the millenium falcon??<br />  The one and only redeeming feature is a long collection of spoofs. Everything from home made youtube videos, to robot chicken and Spaceballs. Just clips, of course, but still, a great set of really funny videos. Frankly, I would have scrapped everything else and been willing to buy a single disc of just the parodies.<br />  If you already have the DVDs, don't bother. If you don't, then buy the DVDs and save some money. Easily the worst Blu ray discs I have. I also have the Lord of the Rings extended DVDs, and I was expecting these to be at least up to the amazing standard that that set managed to achieve. These are not even in the ballpark...
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn is a great app. I get to listen to all of my favorite stations from other states and listen to stations that friends recommend, and do some station surfing to find new favorites.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I absolutely love this album that has some of the best string arrangements I have heard in a long time.  I hope that as they evolve more grit comes into their singing to match the sadness of some of their songs. But I just love the producing on the album overall.
0345803485|1.0|The hype about this book is the confirmation of our society ignorance and unintelligence. I can only imagine how disturbed and mad the \\"real\\" writers out there are. And what about sexual education and strong minded and well educated young woman? Good luck teaching the new generation about those when thousands are awaiting on that poor written, delusional book at the public libraries!
B007OXWWX4|5.0|I would like to know how long the dvd is that comes with the cd/deluxe box set &  the offer for the mail in t-shirt: is that a freebie? or is there some special purchases you have to make to get it? And lastly what is the deal with the dig a packaging? is there some special mini post or pictures that are part of it? I would just like to know if the extra $11 is worth the buy for it. I know slash has always given the fans more than there moneies worth. Times are tough & I just want to be happy with the purchase of the deluxe package. Please reply as quick as possible, so I can make my order to get delivery before the weekend, I live over 75 miles from any real music shops so that make amazon my main seller I buy from. Thanks for taking the time to read this & help me if you can. Long live Slash & his brand of rock n roll forever !!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great if u are patient and persistant... can get tedious after the second rounnd of games since you have to repeat multiple times in order to earn games.  will definitely keep you busy
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I had read The Kite Runner and was eager to read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  My recommendation would be to read them back to back to get the true flavor of how life was and still is in the Middle East.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Mr. Mitchell takes us on a journey through various eras set in diverse locales, enabling us to suspend our disbelief through his talent for points of view that are at once true to their time and universal. In Dickensonian fashion, he brings the details and intricacies of the seeming diverse tales into a neat grab bag, cinched tight for an exquisite ending.
0439023513|3.0|I would have to say that the first book pull me because of the interesting storyline. However, I didn't immediately feel a strong desire to go right into the next book. When I finally decided to read the second book, it read much like the first book, only with a little more story development. The final book seemed to struggle with developing with a conclusion. Again I liked the story idea, I just think the author wasn't descriptive enough in describing the scenes. Overall I would give the series a C+.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I downloaded this app because it was the free app of the day and at first didn't realize how to play it.  Once I figured it out it is a blast.  It got a sodoku feel to it but different at the same time.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I think that its really good and I like how it was made,but I think its missing something. any ways,  I like this app and I recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not usually read science fiction but took a chance after reading other reviews....so glad I did!  The plot kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was coming next . Realistic characters that i was hoping would still be standing when the book ended. This story will pull you in and keep you reading long into the night.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is another one of those games that at first glance looks easy.<br />It will suck you in and may eventually drive you crazy.<br />I like the concept and the pictographys are fun to discover.<br />Well worth the price.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie. Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy! Its pretty long. But its fun to be submerged into that era
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book out of curiosity from all the hype, but the repetitive sex scenes got boring after a while. It leaves you hanging at the end, except I have no interest whatsoever in reading the rest of the series.
1468161660|5.0|Loved the story.  Especially the young characters who actually had mature thoughts and feeling.  Can't wait to read the next book.  Really felt connected to everyone in this book and felt a sense of loss when it ended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Our whole family enjoy this app.  I like most of the games we've unlocked.  Some games are a little hard.  There seem to be a calibration problem with some of the games that requires you to touch the screen and flick an item on the screen.  But with over 100 games, you have a lot to choose from.  I do not like all of the games, but I do like a lot of them.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app gives you the freedom to download any video from youtube.I highly recomend you get this app especially for movie on the go .
B0063IH60K|4.0|i like the super simple set up. I love the auto complete function. I don't understand the random game selection option though.
B007VGXS8M|2.0|i bought  this app because it looked pretty fun. i like the wheres waldo books &amp; i thought that it would be about the same... but i was wrong. unless theres a button that lets you scroll out and i havent found it yet, you have to continually go back and forth on the screen!!!! VERY irritating!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The author of this book really should try to be a little more original.  Anyone who read Twilight and then read this knows what I mean.  Anastasia and Isabella are the same two pale, klutzy characters...same mannerisms...everything.  Divorced parents, dad never re-married, mom married multiple times living in the south with her current husband.  Christian and Edward, the Dominant and the Vampire.  You'll never believe where the book takes place...Oregon and Seattle.  I'm guessing this British author isn't familiar enough with the states to come up with another location.  My advice to E. L. James, find a new job or write Judy Bloom books for pre-teens who still walk around saying \\"Jeez\\" all the time.  The only reason this can't be in the kids section is the author's use of profanity and delusional sex scenes.  Really???
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games on this app are very pointless but adicting so I like it but it gets very annoying *
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is amazing and I use it every week at church as well as a great app to use as a study guide
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is the best game to pass time... seriously I played it for 4 hours straight and it felt like 30 minutes
B006AZZPCM|4.0|works great but when you share a video to facebook it wont let you actullay get back to youtube other than that its good
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I had bought this in 2006 and to make a long story short, something happened to my set and I finally got around to buying another one.  It says new on the wrapper but there was a lot of dirt/dust/torn pieces of paper in between the plastic that the whole box slides in and out from.  Also, the  last page and inside of the hard cover are scraped through to the white part (both sides) as if something was between the pages and the book was closed tightly over it.  There was a big dust clot on that same spot but I just simply wiped it off. There are light scuffs on the spine of the book/dvds too but its really not too much of a big deal. Yes, it came in plastic wrap but it looks like it took a bit of a beating somewhere since the box it was shipped in was in great shape.  I really was hoping it would have came in the original thick acrylic case that the original release had.  I hope my discs work, I have yet to play any but after reading another review, I see I have a 2007 release so I hope it all plays through.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I can only visit \\"nearby neighbor\\" I was able to visit my husbands homestead, but only for a short period of time. Now it says \\"connections problems\\" or something and I can not scroll over to where his icon is suppose to be. I hope they can get this fixed. I also have no idea how to add friends to a friends list for gameloft other than my husband, therefore I he is my only neighbor.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is hilarious. It has all the stuff you want from a zombedy. Make no mistake...the zombies are here! So are the brits!
1466401885|5.0|Couldn't put this book down when I started!!! Finished it in 2 days and then read it again right after. Cant wait for Travis's POV!!!!!
015601386X|4.0|I am a preschool teacher, and I teach the children in my room German, so I purchased this story to read them. They like it pretty well, as I do translations, but they wanted more pictures!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love picross on the gameboy and ds. I always thought that it would make an awesome transition to touch screen mobiles but this is the first I've seen it released.<br /><br />The app is great. Good puzzles, great variety. My favorite puzzle game available here at last. I only wish they  add level in the future<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it at $5.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love love love love this book! my only problem was when she found gale i thought it would turn into some stupid romance book. thank god it didnt! i absolutly love this book! and the movie. so if you read this dont think it turns into a love story! dont worry your safe. this book rocks!
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|This cover is a piece of crap!  The groove on the back to create a stand isn't deep enough to hold my Kindle Fire.  Don't waste your money on this one!
B004D7GU3M|5.0|This is a great album. Kanye's production is terrific. The record comes On 3 180 gram black records. The packaging is wonderful with a triple gate fold and framable versions of the albums six different album arts, as well as a 24\\" x 24\\" poster
B0072IVGZG|5.0|The best thing about the Cult is that they continue to grow and change. They accept their past but work towards the future as well. How many \\"rock\\" bands today occupy that rare space between pop-radio friendly and hard core metal? As a band that has, at one time or another, walked many hallways and could be stuck with many labels, once again these guys refuse to be pigeon-holed. The Cult returns with an album that is relevant, invigorating and inspiring. From the energy of \\"The Wolf\\" and \\"For the Animals\\" to the sonic \\"Elemental Light\\" and funky \\"A Pale Horse\\", The Cult move all around the place and just play music the way they want to play it. I hear all sorts of things in here; some old school Iggy Pop, some vibes from the \\"Love\\" era, the swagger of \\"Beyond Good & Evil\\" and even some \\"Electric\\" tones. Lyrically there seem to be lots of elements about forgiveness, survival, hope.<br /><br />Ian is in top form as vocalist, growling and spitting out his lyrics. He really seems to be at a cool place mentally, much more than I think I've ever seen him. Billy maintains his place as the strong-armed guitarist, cranking out solid grooves with bravado and intensity. Duffy always draws me in with his guitar playing and he's in top form here. Tempesta is a great drummer and really fits well with his percussion. Mr. Wyse fills the bass slot perfectly.<br /><br />I've been a long time fan and I'm amazed that they are back with so much energy and organization. Musicians like this remind me that you don't have to get apathetic while growing old. The search for meaning and new things is a life long process that we should all work tirelessly for. Billy was quoted as saying that this album was really for their fans and it shows. Thanks guys for delivering a great piece of work. So proud of you.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm only into the second set of levels, but I love this game! The only way I could easily describe it is like color by numbers meets sudoku. I find it more engaging than regular sudoku, because as you solve the puzzle using similar logic as in sudoku, you are also trying to figure out just what you're drawing. Even though I got this app as the free app of the day, I'd definitely pay the $4.95 for it! Great job developers!<br />Btw, i have it on Kindle Fire, and no issues thus far!
B003IKMR0U|4.0|I bought Zombie Dice based on the Table Top review I watched.  It's a fun dice game, similar to a combination of Farkle and Don't Stop.  Easy to learn, hard to master and really hard to know when to stop before rolling once too many times and get shotgunned.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the dice container it comes with.  The bottom was constantly falling off, scattering the dice everywhere, making it frustrating to pass around.  Plus, I think the container needs to be slightly larger for larger hands to reach in to grab the dice each turn.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a really fun, inexpensive game that young kids would enjoy as well as adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not get all the hype about this series but I<br /> bought the first book to see. Wow, I could not put the book down! Loved it and continued with the whole series. I am sad they are over. Worth buyingforsure.
1401235417|5.0|Lots of writers have over the decades taken lots of different approaches to Batman.  Impressive enough as a fine prose writer, Snyder's \\"The Court of Owls\\" will certainly earn him a place among the highest tier of authors to riff on the Dark Knight, indeed, it may well signal a place to come in that pantheon of truly extraordinary comic book maestros.<br /><br />In \\"Court of Owls,\\" Snyder is firing on every cylinder.  He creatively combines two recurring Batman plot elements for which I have a particular weakness (Gotham City as more than a setting but as a character and Bruce Wayne's first love, along with further exploring the history of the Wayne family).  Just as Bruce Wayne launches a major urban renewal program, his evening half is confronted by a mysterious murder.  The murder evokes \\"The Court of Owls,\\" a Gotham legend captured in a nursery rhyme.  According to the myth, the Court of Owls is a secret society that \\"watches\\" over Gotham.  Batman has investigated the whether the Court exists and has determined it to be a myth -- but was he right?<br /><br />One cannot say much more without risking spoilers (several reviews here get too close to that line for my taste), but suffice to say, Snyder works wonders.  On top of a very solid plot and a gripping story arc, his sense of Bruce Wayne as a character is extraordinary -- a man cut off from his emotions, able to pretend during the day and unleash his rage by night -- as well as what promises to be a vital and complex perspective on Dick Grayson.  He also manages to incorporate some of the more metaphysical elements of the Batman mythos (owls prey on bats), without it feeling anything less than organic to the story.  Snyder also demonstrates an awareness of the fact that, more perhaps than with other comic heroes, suspense is a vital element in a successful batman story.<br /><br />On a last note, I'd be negligent if I failed to mention artist Greg Capullo.  His style, toned down some from his Spawn days, suitsSnyder's vibe like a bat in a cave.  It is dark and evocative and at times almost verging on the florid, yet maintains a sense of grim reality that leaves a reader worried about the consequences of every choice and turn.  One thing is certain, whatever your worries about DCs new reboot, the Caped Crusader has landed in the hands of a pair of spectacular talents!  No true Batman fan will want to miss this book.
0517548232|5.0|I've read this one before, but was recently reminded that I wanted to read it again. The first time I read it, I'd checked out the original (written in 1946) from the library. This time, I purchased the revised (in 1978) edition, which includes MUCH more.<br /><br />As the auspicious title indicates, Hazlett -- a philosopher, economist, and journalist -- has broken economics down into one simple lesson. In fact, he further breaks it down into one sentence: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"<br /><br />The \\"lesson\\" portion of the book is only four pages long, but is followed up by nearly 200 pages of application of this lesson to a number of circumstances. For those who think that economics is boring, I hope you'll take me at my word: this book is not boring! Not only does Hazlitt succeed in speaking clearly for the layman; he also makes a sometimes difficult subject truly fascinating. Given the current state of our economy, books like this are needed now more than ever!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great for devotional times and for getting the Bible on the go! I love all of the reading plans, perfect for a daily reminder of all God has done for us.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|With my  IQ of 156 and for 80 years not able to understand why the rest of the universe was less than perfect, the author's articulated concepts were an interesting handle on understanding myself.
145470246X|5.0|Sabine really outdid herself with this beautiful book. This is one book I know that I will be referring to many times for inspiration. Page after page is loaded with sparkling eye candy! The photographs are beautifully done and the directions are both clear and concise. Sabine is such and innovative beader and it is a joy to take a glimpse into the way her immagination works! Thank you for sharing skills with us, Sabine!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Hot steamy and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat wanting more... May not be the ideal book for everyone however it is entertaining.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|WOMAN IN BLACK is an eerie, atmospheric ghost story reminiscent of the Hammer films of the late fifties, early sixties.  No gore or overwrought violence, relying on its spooky storyline and moody frightening to propel its effect.<br />Daniel Radcliffe leaves Harry Potter behind as Arthur, a young attorney on the verge of losing his job and recovering from the death of his wife who died in childbirth.  Radcliffe has to carry the weight of the film and while not a totally convincing performance, he is committed and sincere and should have a promising career.<br />Ciaran Hinds offers his usual stalwart support and two-time Oscar nominee Janet McTeer is chilling in her brief role as Hinds' disturbed wife.<br />I liked Marco Beltrani's haunting score and the cinematography is extremely effective.<br />It's good to see Hammer's rebirth--I grew up on their Dracula/Frankenstein movies!
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review about any book before, but I felt like it was necessary here.  I can't even finish this story.  The characters are incredibly two dimensional.  I can't find realism in anything they say or do...just plain not believable.  Everyone is drawing parallels between this and Twilight.  The difference is Twilight works. It's vampires and werewolves...it's already not believable.  In this book we don't even get the added benefit of the paranormal.<br /><br />I don't think this classifies as erotica.  It's not even a romance.  I don't know what this is.  I am all for a good sex scene, but there don't seem to be any.  It's the same thing over and over.  I am shocked this has gone viral.  It is hard for me to understand why something so lacking in imagination would stir women to such a level.<br /><br />It's terrible really.  I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero. The repetition is enough to drive you insane.  One more inner goddess cheer or cartwheel would have made me vomit.  I had to stop reading.
0345803485|1.0|This book was extremely annoying to read.  The writing is very amateurish.  I kept feeling I was reading a book written by someone from Middle School.  How this got published is beyond me.  It is by far the worst book I've ever read and no the content did not offend me, but even that was written so badly it was boring...Y...A...W...N.....
1608870081|5.0|Though this book is only a few pages long, the detail is amazing. I've never seen pop-ups quite like this. Each time I turned the page, I found myself going, \\"Ooh!!\\" This is a must-have for any fan. Though short, they pack a lot of information and detail into each page. The artwork is so fantastic. I'm so glad I bought this!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Great puzzle game, sudoku fans will be sucked right in. Presentation is nice, touch controls are a bit tricky when zoomed out, be prepared to scroll often while zoomed in. By the way, the tutorial does not mention it, and perhaps it was supposed to be understood, but the order of the numbers DOES matter! If you've never done these puzzles before, read the wiki page!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Really fun to play! Sometimes easy pictures, sometimes who knows what one to try.I Play with freinds and family,and a few people the game picked for me! I play on my KFire, it works great. And I have a nice screen to draw on while most play on their phone. Even if you can't draw very good- it's lots of fun &amp; funny! Get it-and best of all it's FREE!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Sex is simple. Affection is dangerous. And love... all kinds of trouble. And Eva & Gideon have all but cornered the market on trouble. They're two sides of the same double faced coin & can go rounds on the issues train. They pushed & pulled each other like it was sport. Triggers & defense mechanisms with a huge dose of cut & run. As a reader, I loved them but damn it if they weren't exhausting!<br /><br />I very much liked Eva as a character. She's a woman I can root for. She was witty, comfortable with her sexuality & even when she was making mistakes, she was honest enough not to delude herself that she was wholly right. She had no problem setting boundaries with Gideon but she also owned her physical attraction & wanton lust for him. Fantastic. Nothing annoys me more than a heroine that is wishy-washy & confused about her wants & needs. Eva had no problem calling Gideon an a**hat & flipping him off as she walked away. She loves Gideon but it's not to the exclusion & eclipse of herself or her emotional well-being. She also displayed her own deep & overwhelming vulnerabilities, so she had my heart. Though, she could have stood to have mentioned his perfection of looks a lot less. It struck me as a bit juvenile an obsession for an otherwise aware woman. Especially since she is seeking more than a physical & surface connection with Gideon. I don't mind her acknowledging his hotness but reiterating it every time they had a moment together was a bit tedious.<br /><br />Gideon initially struck me as definitely hiding behind a facade. I was sure he was a hot mess of insecurity wrapped up in some wicked crazy. I know he's supposed to be all \\"alpha\\" but those types generally offered in popular fiction translate in my mind as overcompensating & insecure when they break out the stalker behavior & veiled (& not so veiled) threats to the object of their obsession. Desperate doesn't register as sexy & infinitely shaggable to me. And I also don't find that \\"heroine in actual fear of hero\\" thing a trope that hits high on the hot quotient. So I needed more time to see if Gideon would be that type. Happily, he wasn't that guy, though he definitely was insecure & bringing his own Cross brand of crazy to the party. Lucky for him, Eva matches him in the epic mood swing department, so I didn't mind watching them unfurl on each other. He also displayed real affection for Eva & seemed to freely admit when he messed thing up. I can't hate a man who is willing to apologize for his stupidity.<br /><br />They both have for real problems of the life-time scarring & sometimes emotionally paralytic variety. I just loved that they were going to give a real relationship a go, even with their own private, unspoken trepidation. I'm a sucker for hope against the odds. Together they're emotional, damaged, desperate, jealous & needy. What is infinitely fascinating is watching them try to be better than those aspects of their personalities & overcome them to be better people. Because in the end, they do want to be the best person they can be for themselves & the other person. I love that. There's no \\"I'll fix you\\" from either of them. It's more a \\"I'll help you\\". No matter what else is going on they have a parity that I very much like.<br /><br />What am I forgetting? Oh, yes. The sex. They have it. They have a lot of it. They talk about it like adults. It's explicit & not even close to kinky. It's hot. They have good banter. While they often used sex as a sedative & reliable means of communication instead of opting to use their words for important conversations, I was just glad they were getting moments of mind-numbing, coma-inducing sex. It gave them breaks between obsessing, self-loathing slips & other states of mania. I have to buy into both the characters singly & as a couple to care about the sex they're having & this book didn't disappoint. Oddly though, the things I highlighted on my Kindle weren't their sex scenes. I was most moved & intrigued by their other interactions. I'm hoping there's more of them working through their issues with Dr Petersen & verbally with one another in the next installment.<br /><br />I know this is a high recommendation for fans of the formerly Twilight-fan-fiction, Fifty Shades series, but as a chica who has not read that series (but loves a good romance/erotica), I can say without reservation that Bared to You was a great read & fascinating glimpse at these characters. This was totally worth stepping out of my usual historical fiction romance/erotica genre & into a contemporary. I definitely look forward to the next installment in this series as I quite need to know how they'll fare & I'm desperate to get more into the depths of these characters. I'm so rooting for them.ther interactions.

B000I62JAK|4.0|\\"Zoolander\\" is not a very deep movie, but it does have quite a few very amusing and easily quotable bits that have entered \\"pop culture\\" and makes this worth seeing.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), a truly dense male model, as he defends his title as \\"Model of the Year\\" against newcomer \\"Hansel\\" (Owen Wilson). Throw in an investigative reporter (Christine Taylor), a secret shadow organization with an international assassination plot, many cameos (don't want to ruin the \\"ah ha\\" factor by listing them), and a generally fun plot, and you get a very watchable movie. There are some \\"mature\\" scenes, but nothing too shocking.<br /><br />We find ourselves quoting lines from this movie quite often and have had to watch it with family members to bring them up to speed on our jokes.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

0743442539|5.0|The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is a fantastic spy vs. spy story set in the late 60s Cold War.  Alec Leamas is a lonely and haunted spook who is well past his prime and knows it.  After years of being in \\"The Cold\\" his moral compass is seriously confused, his loyalties are questionable and his daily scotch intake is enormous.  For the entirety of his career he has been outsmarted and outgunned by his spook counterpart in East Germany and now in the twilight years of his life and career he is given the opportunity for the ultimate Coup de Grace.<br /><br />Alec Leamas is a true gem in a literary world over run by Bondesque assassin spies.  The stark, arid and cold world that Le Carre paints in this book is fantastic and proves to be the perfect arena for a washed up old man to consider a life spent in the grey areas of morality.  Leamas's character development is absolutely superb throughout and by itself would provide a worthy read, but the plot is fantastic.  Throughout the book the plot twists and turns in unimaginable ways that, in my imagination, must be hauntingly reminiscent of what the real spy game looks like.<br /><br />The prose and literary style of this books are without peer in the genre, the main character is intriguing, the plot is amazingly twisted and convoluted, and the pace never slows down.<br /><br />This is my current favorite in the genre - Highly Recommended

One of the songs reminds me of the eighties...and I love the eighties. I will be purchasing this album! The lead singer can actually sing! LOL! I know that was a captain obvious moment...but you know how you hear one good song on the radio and you listen to the album and it sucks? Well this ain't that! Thank goodnes!
0984183523|3.0|He's very good at self-promotion but in Case Interview Secrets he's phoning it in. Because this book is very good at driving home the hypothesis-based strategy for answering candidate-led cases I'd rank it above Ohrvall's Crack the Case. However, it's weak on estimation cases, it's pitifully weak on practices cases - it has none!  It doesn't have a fraction of the material that Case in Point has. Case in Point has 40 practice cases, a number of case starts, it's much better on note layout, and information on how to answer cases, not just set them up.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I love this new turn Norah has taken. Some artist try new things and it ends up being a disaster ie. Garth Brooks and that weird alter-ego....uugh! But the new turn was a good one for Norah. I see some people are disappointed because she doesn't sound exactly like all her previous albums. To that I say have an open mind. She sounds as great as ever with a little twist from Danger Mouse. You can't go wrong with him...example Cee-Lo. A southern rapper turned crooner, and he's doing pretty good for himself these days...that's all I have to say!
0345803485|4.0|After reading the other reviews, I find myself agreeing with two of them. I almost did not get this book because I actually thought it was just going to be a lot of porn and no plot. A friend recommended it so I figured I would give it a try. It had a number of sex scenes, probably some that many will feel are over the top, but the story was engrossing enough that I wanted to find out how it would play out in the end. If a book can cause you to have varying emotions and keep you reading and buying the sequels, it can't be all bad. Even those that downgraded it for various reasons had to buy and read the final books. Unlike one reviewer, I do not intend to read this series again, but like others I enjoy it enough to have already bought the final two books. I will let you know how that works out. I knew and may still know nothing about the odd sex that is described in the book. Sometimes you feel like ringing Christian's neck but you can see that his upbringing caused much if not all of his emotional problems.  Have to say I was surprised I liked this book. Fast summer read......give it a try.
B0080XN3C6|4.0|This chick is like a breath of fresh air! She's good! She has style...I like that. Not like the Jessie James' and Robyns' of pop music I've been hearing latley. She actually has substance. I'm buying it. To anyone who likes to try new artists she's a good find. She even has a remix of Cameo Lover with Sam Sparro, who is also from her area of Australia and a wonderful whiteboy with soul!! I love Sam's album and I have it...if you don't have it you should check him out as well. He has a couple of songs on his album that sound like Prince is actually singing background for him!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a really nice game. It is a little tough to play on a standard size phone. It should be fine for a Kindle Fire or similar sized device. Doesn't make any sense to refer to it as crossword. There are no words. Cool game though. Well done.
B007NESBK2|4.0|I love Sade but I can't believe \\"Babyfather\\" is not included. That is a great song and a successful single to be missing...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R R Martin (lovingly known as GRRM by his fans) keeps up his usual performance of astounding world-building, in-depth character development, and captivating storytelling. If you've liked previous books in GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire Series, you'll enjoy this one just as much. If, however, you tend to get confused or bored trying to follow multiple involved story-lines, or if you're just looking for a short a simple read, you probably won't be able to savour this volume any more than the last four.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|Kimbra is a female singer from New Zealand that was introduced to the world this year as Gotye's duet partner on the mega hit \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\". However, she made waves in her homeland before that.  And it's easy to see why - she does have a beautiful voice. Kimbra's debut album, \\"Vows\\", has now been released in the US and other countries outside Australia/NZ.  The world can see a fuller picture of her.<br /><br />Kimbra's style is eclectic - her album is influenced by jazz-pop, indie pop, soul, and electronica.  Her beautiful voice fits well with all these styles. But that's where her eclecticism stops.  These are the only style I could see her doing - hip-hop, electro house, or hard rock would not be her forte.<br /><br />\\"Vows\\" is a pretty tight collection of songs. Almost all the reviews from others about the album have been positive.  Some have added critical comments about how the songs are not ambitious. Or too polished and don't adequately capture her raw talent. This is true, but it is still good pop-soul-jazz-indie music where her voice is effective.<br /><br />Almost all the tracks are slow or mid tempo - except for one, there's no songs that could get you dancing. The one upbeat track is \\"Warrior\\", which is produced by Mark Foster of Foster The People. \\"Warrior\\" is an indietronica song like Foster The People's stuff.  \\"Settle Down\\", \\"Two Way Street\\", \\"Good Intent\\", and \\"Plain Gold Ring\\" are excellent tracks that have jazz and 60s/70s soul influence. These are tracks that Amy Winehouse could have done.  \\"Cameo Lover\\" is a nice track influenced by 80s R&B.<br /><br />(4 out of 5 stars)

1469984202|5.0|This was my first exposure to the world of Wool and it has been a one of the best investments of my money for me.  The writing style is nothing fancy but the author's cleverness comes through in how he presents the characters and the world of the Silo.  Mr. Howey skillfully feeds the reader only enough background and technical information to entice them through each story.  Through the scant descriptions of the Silo and the way of life in it he creates another character that engages the reader's imagination in such a manner that you will thinking about the world of Wool even long after you have put down the book.  It will cause you to rethink your opinions of what makes people evil.  Is it acting in their own best interests and being selfish or performing deeds for a greater good that is that has been handed down and not validated.  These stories will get your brain thinking on so many levels about the characters in this book and how things are with authority figures in your own life.  I would highly recommend this book but be forewarned as the author has only scratched the surface of the world he has created.  Mr. Howey, I'm hooked as a \\"Woolite\\" and I would gladly read the rest of your works.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Became acquainted with the band a year or so ago with \\"Paradise Lost\\" and, shortly after, \\"V: The New Mythology.\\" Loved the energy and glimpses of progressive beauty. Within the past week I started devouring their other work, from Damnation Game up to Odyssey, and discovered that those albums were only the tip of the iceberg that is Symphony X. With glorious works like The Divine Wings of Tragedy, Through the Looking Glass, and The Odyssey fresh in my mind, even \\"V\\" took on a new element, which is why I recommend those new to Symphony X listen to the band's earlier, more progressive work before attempting to appreciate Iconoclast.<br /><br />I listened to a few measures of each song when I first got the album, to form a sort of preliminary judgment, and found myself turning up my nose. \\"Meh,\\" I thought. \\"Same old riffs, same old lyrics.\\" However when I pondered the theme of the album, drawing from the title, artwork, and interviews about the album, and decided to just sit back and let the whole album wash over me, feeling a little more optimistic, it really did come alive as a beautifully cohesive and relevant work of art. Hell, I'd even call it evocative.<br /><br />The quality of the compositions is outstanding, though at first listen they might seem too faithful to the genre. The hooks make or break the album in that respect. If fact they make it, thanks mostly to the passionate and catchy vocal composition and the flavorful synths sprinkled throughout. Speaking of synths, it's a great relief that they gain more prominence on Iconoclast and feature some surprisingly unique, deliciously dark, and not at all cheesy sounds, which are usually short-lived and therefore more striking and tantalizing. Make no mistake, though, they do occupy a mostly backing role... For what should lead the way but the guitar? Speed and distortion to the max, what differentiates the guitar on Iconoclast compared to earlier works and Paradise Lost especially is a more organic arrangement and progression throughout the song, a pattern which of course is followed by the rhythm section; the drums and bass pound, rattle, and roll with brutal consistency, underlining the overall sonic fury. Wow. I almost forgot about the lyrics, but that's just because they flow so well into the emotion and complexity of the music; here is a set of lyrics that makes me think and feel strongly about not just some concept but about my own life and the world that we live in. But like I said, the words flow so intricately with the music it's almost futile to try and separate them (so we can forgive the occasional clich&eacute; where frankly it gets the job done.) Finally, I'd like to give praise to The Lord of Chaos for incorporating an unexpected blues rock-turned-metal riff, and a wag of the finger to the band for not making this a double album to begin with.<br /><br />Add this essential recording to your collection. Why? Because it rocks, first of all, and because it features an insanely talented band outgrowing their influences, outgrowing themselves, and still noticeably improving, all to offer you and me an album that is fresh, inspired, and of high sound production quality, but not for the faint of heart.and progression throughout the song, a pattern which of course is followed by the rhythm section; the drums and bass pound, rattle, and roll with brutal consistency, underlining the overall sonic fury.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|At first this book seemed like pure trash but it hooks the reader so that you want to know what happens.  You go to the second book and then the third.  In retrospect, the story is one of what happens to children who are born to parents that are into drugs and prostitution.  It is timely for this problem happens all too often.  It is also the story of what can happen when a person loves another enough to put up with problems and love that person into a normal life.
B005LAIGLE|2.0|Bad acting, over acting, and a badly written script! Unless you are a big fan of Mark Wahlberg, you will be disappointed with this movie. (Even being a fan, you might be disappointed.) The ending was not too bad. I just loved that the captain of the cargo ship is out to sea and is in his \\"dress\\" uniform the entire time! On a cargo ship?? The captain of the Love Boat even wore a casual uniform.

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Not big on \\"chick heroes\\" but I think she did great. The fight scenes were realistic (as she actually CAN do the things she is pretending to do) and I thought it was a good movie. LOVE THE FACT THEY DIDNT FEEL SHE OR ANY OTHER WOMAN HAD TO BE NAKED OR SOME GUY HAD TO SHOW HIS BUTT OR SCHLONG JUST BECAUSE ITS R RATED. Nudity seems to always be in action movies, whether its two guys meet in a strip club, someone sleeps with someone, etc. which really has nothing to do with anything other than giving you something nasty to look at as though the action and story line couldnt possibly be enough. So the movie gets extra points just for no nudity.<br />Overall, the movie could have been a tad better, but it was not a stinker like soooo many action movies nowadays. The cast did a good job.
B000005DQR|5.0|Disc is classic front to back . When is there a bad song?? How about never, Can listen to this as background music of life, you can't go wrong.
B0056K4VRM|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to these recordings for several months and was very surprised by pclaudel's negative review. I have since carefully listened to each of the six CDs and find no basis whatever for that reviewer's concerns. Indeed, the recording of the Linz symphony is superb, quite comparable to the other wonderful recordings of Mozart's last symphonies that Bruno Walter made in California in 1959 and 1960. A few of the pieces in this set, the Requiem and symphonies 25, 28, and 29 are earlier mono recordings and don't have the clarity of the later recordings. Even these, however, are good transfers and are certainly listenable.<br /><br />I note that pclaudel refers to \\"Sony USA\\" in his review. My set's package and individual discs say, \\"Made in the E. U.\\" I wouldn't have thought that there would be inferior transfers in identical packaging sold in the U. S., but of course I can't be sure of that.<br /><br />Bottom line: I find this set a most rewarding experience and an honest group of transfers of Bruno Walter's Mozart.
B00723NWJE|4.0|This is an interesting album. Norah Jones is an amazing talent. Though different, the sound is dynamic as is this new approach to an album. I am still getting used to it, but I will say that it is growing on me. It is good to see Norah Jones put out something different, challenging and probably something that as an endearing quality to it.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I immediately fell in love with Kisses on the Bottom. It is amazing how he performed these standards bringing me back in time. I was thinking of Frank Sinatra when I first listened to this album. When I played it again, I felt it was actually closer to Nat King Cole, or more specifically, the way McCartney approached these songs drew out the smooth and endearing touch that Nat King Cole always delivered. This is sort of a homage to that era but also a nostalgic and reflective look back in more ways than one.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love this game, its so much fun, worked perfectly at first but after maybe two days it began to crash. Whenever open it up it crashes and takes me back to the home screen. Lame.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|What can I say? I like GARBAGE. I like their sound. I like their style. It's that simple. That is just scratching the surface, but that is all that has to be said. If you look too deep, one may become disappointed. Just immerse yourself in the sound, the experience. For me \\"Control\\" is utterly mesmerizing. \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" is kind of groovy \\"Felt\\" is just totally awesome. \\"Sugar\\" does it for me. It is just so alluring. I think it is the best cut along with \\"Bright Tonight.\\" Anyway, enough said!

B007MAETA8|5.0|When I first listened to this album, the first thing I thought of was Sam Peckinpaw of all things. That's kind of bewildering when I think about it, but I think Peckinpaw would have loved this. There is a certain vision to this music, a certain piece of Americana that somehow parallels director Peckinpaw's vision of our roots in his more endearing moments. Born and Raised is smooth, laid backed, mellow, contemplative, energetic and utterly dynamic in its execution of a somewhat homespun purely American sound. That was my impression. I just put this album on and let ride.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This is a well written thriller, a real page turner. It is very far fetched in places and very real in others. If you like a survival story this is for you.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|George Harrison was hardly the quiet one. His music, his guitar and voice speak for themselves. The mastering or re-mastering done here hopefully captures the essence of George Harrison and I think it does. Just like so many greats, we often thought he is playing just for us. Perhaps he was. We just never knew it.

I know I heard it was described as \\"soft porn\\" or \\"mom porn\\" I was expecting a lot worse.  Although, it is a bit repetitive it was still a good book! It kept me wanting to see what happened next. I am glad I read the whole trilogy! For her first novel It isn't for everyone.. but I truly enjoyed it

B001N18HOQ|5.0|I usually hate repackages or deluxe versions because there isn't much reason to repurchase something, especially if its just to get a bonus or live track or 2. Or if it states 'Remastered' and just sounds LOUDER than the original. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth to waste money on something i already own just for a sleek new package. I have fallen victim to that many time as i am a bit of a music collector, but that is not the deal here. In fact the worst part about THIS deluxe version, IS the original CD.<br /><br />PJ's 'Ten' is one of the best rock albums in history and definitely one of the top 3 of the 90's. No filler, all killer. PJ were very fresh and unique in the grunge era, but this CD is no fad or time capsule. Every track still holds up. Still have all the impact, no questions.<br /><br />So Why buy it again?<br /><br />Reason 1:<br />The Remix/remaster is ESSENTIAL! You hear so much more than on the original. Guitar notes, backing Vocals and pure, loose aggression. The original sounds very muddy in comparison and that sounded great for its time. The undercurrent of some of these tracks changes dramatically on these remasters. Especially the slower tracks like Oceans, Black and Release. More crisp and vibrant. Really makes you 'feel' the tracks better.<br />The so called 'Heavier' tracks sound much less restrained and you can here the individual notes that were masked on the original, and they never sounded bad to begin with, but now you just hear more. You hear the picking and open notes that seemed masked under bar chords on the original. Much more Live sounding.<br />Very very good remix and one of the best i have heard to date. It does what a newer version should do which is bring out things the older version may not have brought out because of when it was made or because it wasn't mixed well on a smaller label prior. When i bought this i didn't think it would be much of a difference because this was so well produced, but boy i was wrong.<br /><br />Reason 2:<br />The excellent MTV unplugged DVD. So great to have that in my collection after all these years. They were hungry and very good in that setting. Riveting performance by the band when the 'Unplugged' thing was still new and exciting. Brought back great memories and is solid from start to finish. Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Reason 3:<br />The bonus tracks after the remixed CD is great PJ material. Was cool to hear different stuff from that period that didn't make the cut but should have. These are not throw away tracks by any means and really adds to the flavor of the package.<br /><br />Reason 4:<br />Nice box Hardcover Slipcase and book. Beautiful booklet to flip through with a lot of photos, billboards/signs and song notes to check out as you listen.<br /><br />If you like PJ and have not bought this set you are truly missing out. If, for some extremely odd reason, you never bought this disc, you have no excuse now. Essential purchase and a great souvenir to celebrate a game changing album. Very highly recommended.ason 2:<br />The excellent MTV unplugged DVD. So great to have that in my collection after all these years. They were hungry and very good in that setting.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I just popped in a 16gb SD card loaded with music and I was good to go. Crystal clear over the radio -- even blocks out local stations. I've been enjoying my music, I turn off the car, and learn there was already a station broadcasting on that frequency. It takes 30 seconds to start up initially, but switching tracks is instantaneous. It's got very good sound quality. It's not as good as the $200 Sony stereo in my old car, but I wouldn't expect it to be.<br /><br />That same stereo had the ability to shuffle one folder or the whole device. It was useful when my wife was in the car -- I could shuffle within a big folder of music she likes. This transmitter will only shuffle the whole device.<br /><br />It doesn't automatically remember where you were in a track. It's unusual, but I like it. Most of the time I would restart tracks with my old stereo, anyway. Who wants to start in the middle of a great song after a hard day's work? The bookmark feature is functional, but you obviously have to set it explicitly. It also remembers it until you unset it. So if you use and don't unset your bookmark, next time you start the unit it'll go back and resume that song. I probably won't use the bookmark unless I'm listening to an audio book or similar.<br /><br />I do have 2 very minor issues.<br />1) The backlight is very bright and not adjustable. It's distracting at night, so I either throw something over it or turn it down to face the console at night.<br />2) My car (a Saab) only powers the port when the car's running. This obviously is something I knew before I ordered, and not Satechi's fault. The result is that the radio stays on after the transmitter's turned off, and discovering a station transmitting on that frequency. I bought this unit to avoid hacking, but I may tap the radio's power to power the port.<br /><br />Update: I tried using a cassette adapter in the line out jack instead of the FM Transmitter, and the sound is every bit as good as that $200 stereo! I'm not sure where the FM loses it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I can hear Paula's immense fields of fat growing as I write this review. She hasn't moved off the couch even once today because she's been playing this. It's a great game, &amp; she doesn't move much as it is. Normally, though, she'd at least get her daily walk from the couch to her fatty scooter, &amp; she hasn't even done that today. At least she isn't pestering me to scrub under her folds &amp; rolls, &amp; asking me to wipe her nether regions. That reminds me...I better check her spot on the couch, cuz she'll just pee &amp; shart where she sits if you don't move her regularly. She's a foul chub-o-lard, &amp; she smells like a dirty hoagie. I'm sure as good as this game is, she won't move for days. Her obese whale flab will get sweaty &amp; covered in greasy food, coca cola, &amp; other bodily fluids, &amp; the house will be putrid in no time! I can always burn the house down. As long as she lets me alone, I'm a happy guy. Thanks, Dynamix!
B000EHSVOG|2.0|Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. pooled their resources to create a perversely watchable disaster. Running nearly three mind-boggling hours, producer Irwin Allen's &#34;The Towering Inferno&#34; (1974) represents the cinematic equivalent of &#34;The Hollywood Squares.&#34; All that's missing is Paul Lynde. Inexplicably nominated for Best Picture, this skyscraper soap opera makes &#34;The Poseidon Adventure&#34; look like &#34;Battleship Potemkin.&#34; A blockbuster cast generates &#34;take-the-money-and-run&#34; embarrassment - except for the inimitable Fred Astaire, who exudes class in the cheesiest of surroundings. (Few things are cheesier than William Holden's red velvet tuxedo.) Stirling Silliphant's ludicrous script includes the most unintentionally hilarious dialogue this side of Ed Wood. The film's strongest asset lies in its much-touted special effects. Seen today, &#34;The Towering Inferno&#34; exists more as a pop-culture artifact than a compelling piece of cinema.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I purchased this disc and settled in to enjoy a recap of one of my favorite zombie movies and WOW - did I ever enjoy the added scenes and alternate ending!  NOW the sequel makes MUCH more sense to me - I detested it the first time around and haven't even seen the third of the trilogy - now I have both on order and can't wait to get my hands on them.<br /><br />One of the points that \\"people\\" miss--and I use quotes because I do believe this type of film has its female fans, but the game and the movie by and large is \\"consumed\\" by a predominantly male audience--is that this is not only a very, very fun action/zombie flick, but with a powerful female action heroine.  I'm seeing this more and more in movies and as a female person, I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Resident Evil is one of the leaders of the pack in this regard.  I am compiling a collection of videos that are not only great movies, but have great female leads.  I've been waiting for this trend all my life; someone to identify with in a film who isn't a screaming victim!  THANK YOU CAPCOM!
B0036D7Y20|5.0|Kempe did not record enough but this recording alone would be enough to preserve his reputation for posterity. He had a gift for maintaining an over-arching shape throughout an opera without allowing the big moments to become desiccated or smoothed over; hence he move effortlessly from the serene sheen of the VPO strings in the Prelude to the muttering menace of the Act II Prelude and preserve dramatic unity.  The VPO still had a highly individual, distinctive sound in the early 60's, not least in the rasp of their woodwind and the dark roundness of their lower strings and they clearly relish playing under Kempe, who had by this time transferred his loyalties to them from Berlin.<br /><br />EMI's casting was as good as could be made in the early 60's; especially striking is Christa Ludwig's Ortrud. Many great artists - Astrid Varnay, Margarete Klose, Gwyneth Jones - have made a triumph of this role but Ludwig, just at that point in her career when she had a brilliant top and extraordinary dark heft in the lower reaches of her mezzo-soprano. Furthermore, her chemistry with the just recently deceased Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's Friedrich is palpable: he craven, blustering and insecure, she steely and imperturbably malignant. I am a non-fan of D-F-D but concede that this is among his finest and most apt characterisations. In fact there is only one serious weakness in the cast: Otto Wiener's elderly-sounding, nasal Herald, so dry and unprepossessing of voice compared with, say, the stentorian Tom Krause for Sawallisch at Bayreuth. Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer is ideal: silvery, vulnerable, ethereal - perfect. Jess Thomas allows the occasional intrusive bleat to mar his line but is otherwise heroic and impassioned. Gottlob Frick is suitably imposing as Henry the Fowler.<br /><br />There are other very recommendable recordings, live, under von Matacic, Sawallisch and Kubelik's studio version but this one holds its ranking as pre-eminent in that it achieves a grandeur and spiritual dimension beyond any other.al dimension beyond any other.
0375842209|5.0|The brilliantly written novel The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is about a family hiding a Jew while living in Nazi Germany during World War II. The Book Thief is a historical fiction book, using factual information from World War II, but adding in the story of a fictional family. Throughout the novel the tone is very serious and mildly depressing when events such as death occur. Oddly enough, the whole novel is narrated by Death himself, which adds a point of view different than most readers are used to. The main characters in The Book Thief are Liesel Meminger, Rudy Steiner, and Max Vandenburg. Liesel and Rudy are best friends who grow up together in the same neighborhood and have about the same family situations. Liesel's family meets Max when he is forced to leave his family and hide in the Hubermanns basement in order to escape from the Nazis. The Book Thief is a novel intended for age groups in high school and above. Some of the parts in this novel are too complex and depressing for younger age groups to understand. This book is so intriguing because it is very easy to connect with all the characters on a personal level. I specifically like how Death is the narrator because I have never read another book where I got to see life through the eyes of Death. The theme of The Book Thief is the strength that unlikely compassion has between some characters in the novel. The purpose in writing this book was to give a personal example of a family hiding a Jewish man in Nazi Germany during World War II. Markus Zusak does an incredible job getting his point across throughout the novel. Markus gives specific details for each character in a way that makes you either like or dislike them depending on whether or not Markus wants you to. I would honestly give this book five stars as it is because it is so interesting and emotional that it left me wanting more. The Book Thief is one of the most interesting books I have ever read, and I would definitely recommend it to any readerlooking for an exciting emotional rollercoaster!
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I have to restart my phone every time I want to play this game or it never loads. It would also be helpful if the numbers carried over when you zoom.
0399534601|5.0|My 9 year old Son and I love this book, everyday is an adventure tapping into all 5 (and sometimes 6) senses! GREAT GIFTS FOR KIDS AND ADULTS who house a creative mind ! We look foward to the next exploration we are going on and have started our own Museum of Life! :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a bit repetitive most games have same objective. still a good time waster though. wish u could unlock new games a little quicker as some games are not fun enough to play again and again.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have to say that this might, just as well, be one of the best FAOTD in quite a while.<br />Game doesn't ask for bizarre or useless permissions, and the playability is just awesome. As you move on, it gets harder to complete the puzzle and you have to think outside the box - really great to keep your mind focused.
B007EC27QM|5.0|love the large keys!!!! my go to calculator. overall I love this calculator. its great!!!! I couldn't live without it.
0345803485|1.0|This novel series is so poorly written, I can't even begin to understand how this got signed on by a publisher. If you want real erotica, Anne Rice knows how the bdsm game is played and knows how to tell the story!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I bought this movie on the recommendation of a friend of mine and I'm glad I did!  I couldn't stop laughing!  \\"FLUFFY DONKEY\\"!
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I am not a Cameron Diaz fan, although I can't say why. Regardless, the movie was pretty darned funny. I'm loath to give props to romantic comedies, but this was surprisingly good. It's certainly no Shawshank Redemption, but it's worth checking out.
0307454894|2.0|Since the first selection I read from the Oprah Book Club was so awesome, (A Virtuous Woman), I decided to add all of them to my TBR list. The Oprah stamp of approval is pretty much the only reason I picked up this book, however that stamp of approval is starting to mean much less because I really did not like this book. The only thing keeping me from giving it one star is the fact that talent gleams randomly throughout the pages. The author is really fabulous at capturing and describing moments and emotions that most people experience. (My favorite passage is a paragraph that starts on pg. 38. In it he discusses how awkward he felt growing up and how he had such hope that one day he would be confident and successful. He had all of these unfulfilled big dreams which he sees reflected in the faces of the youth around him. That hope saddens him because he knows that very rarely does life fulfill and exceed your expectations.)<br /><br />I enjoyed Mr. Schlink's writing very much, but this novel left me feeling empty. There was no hope to be found. Everyone's life had fallen to pieces. I hate feeling empty, like all the light and hope have been sucked dry. Therefore this novel will receive a 2/5 stars.<br /><br />I really love the cover of this novel. It's simple yet incredibly inviting. I think it connects to the tale in a few ways. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is complex, especially for a fifteen-year-old. He fulfills multiple needs in Hanna's life, but it seems to me that his needs cannot even begin to be fulfilled by her. She's emotionally vacant. The book and the flowers show the roles Michael plays in Hanna's life. It's saddens me that she is so flat and so checked out of life.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I just saw this and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a 15 tech tops guy on Wintel and a big Fincher fan. The movie appealed to me as a geek and because I was interested in finding out about the Genesis of FB. I had zero info going in so this was like a news story as much as it was entertainment. I pass no judgment on the folks involved, especially because this was entertainment. However, even the absorption of the Hollywood version was still enlightening.
1591843065|3.0|The Back of the Napkin is worth reading, and is based on good concepts of visual communication.  It's a relatively easy read, and I felt smarter and more capable after finishing it.  It certainly added to my available mental tools, and that's what a good business book should do.<br /><br />The book does flatten out considerably in the middle and toward the end -- when the author started talking about a visual communication MBA, I thought the course material would be much more engaging and interesting.  Unfortunately, the practical examples fall a little bit flat due to short explanations.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with this book is that there are several mistakes in the graphics and drawings, including instances where they're wrong, missing, or incomplete.  For a book on visual communication, and a book that's apparently been revised several times, this is very disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, a good book, and worth reading, but not perfect.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Great action movie but it did not include Diamond Eyes by Shinedown in the soundtrack. I was really looking forward to  seeing/hearing that.<br />daffyb55
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the games are almost impossible to complete and the scrores it wants from you are ridiculous. I wouldnt buy it again.
B0015HOFZI|2.0|Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable (Black) Setup was easy, just plug it in. Directions were scarce. I recorded without being able to hear my music and when played back I still could barely hear it.<br />What does Line in mean and if you're recording from a phono...you set it to phono Right? Well I'm not pleased. It was a lot of work digging out the old albums and cleaning them and recording for hours then the volume is so low you can barely hear it.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|Except for the permissions, this would get a five star rating.<br /><br />When I went to shut down the app, I couldn't even make it Force Close. I had to uninstall it to make it let go of my processor!<br /><br />The only apparent reason for the network sockets-full internet access is if you want to share your scores somehow, but if not, why does it have to lock it's control?<br /><br />Finally, I tried to block it's access with Droidwall and then it wouldn't even load. Just a black screen.<br /><br />Get rid of this kind of control! It makes me fear that some hidden process might be data mining my personal information, let alone my preferences.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would preview their FAOTD before allowing this kind of program to be disseminated.<br /><br />VERY DISSAPPOINTING!!!
B000002KDM|5.0|Sloppy and sentimental but it still has class and soul and will remain a great album, an all time keeper.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|They did such a great job making this! I think I have a new favorite movie! Looks great on Blu-Ray!
1400097029|3.0|His subject - deep, gut-wrenching grief - is a bit of a bummer. And not a lot happens. But John Banville certainly knows how to craft a beautiful sentence.
0345803485|5.0|This book took my breath away, more than once.  To be perfectly honest, I was moved to tears on more than one occasion but that's just me, I'm weird that way.  You see, I'm not the intended demographic this book was aimed for.  And yet I found it so compelling I couldn't put it down.  I actually read the entire trilogy in a little over a week and have started reading it again.  Not what you might expect for a guy living in Florida.  Forget all the BS about how extreme or explicit it is.  That is the only thing the people who don't really bother to read it see.  This is the most beautiful love story I have read in a long time.  Yes, it is inappropriate for an immature audience, but so is half of the great literature out there.  Bottom line, I LOVED it.
0762777931|5.0|presented ideas that deserve careful consideration and worth persuing. interesting language- not real offensive but thought not necessary but ideas were great
B005VA8AZQ|2.0|Every known horror with ghosts that have unknown motivations along with random horrific violence, characters with baggage put in a haunted house in one or two episodes without context.  Nothing relevant to each other to create interest for continuing the series.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like this package. I have also used Documents to Go for quite some time (since ~ Before-The-The-Dawn-of-Time ~ beginning with my Palm Treo), but I like the UI on OfficeSuite a bit better. I also appreciate the ease of connecting to/retrieving/syncing documents from my various clouds. I really like the idea of the presentation software having templates available to use, but it's virtually impossible to realistically consider using any of the available backgrounds; I suppose, however, that what is tasteful to one person might be garish to another, etc.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Once you watch one episode you have to finish all.  Even though violent and brutal it is hard to turn away from the characters' deceits and corruptions to see their resolutions.  When not involved in the plot, great to watch just for the scenery, costumes,carved physiques, and visual action.  One has to get over listening to the \\"latin like\\" talk, but then it becomes a element that makes it feel more like a bygone time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Like running with this type of headphones, hard to find any that will last as long as my yellow ones from sony(6 years), can't seem to buy them anymore.<br />So I went with getting 3 pair of these, for the price great deal.If you are gentle with these they will last, they are light weight. Will be looking for another headset but for now these have good sound and work well for my running.<br />(Marathon training)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is very addicting. it plays great on my kindle fire. would recommend to anybody for a good time passer game.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't like this book much. I think it is degrading to women. I just wanted to scream, get away from this controlling freak. The sex was very graphic but instead of being arousing it gave me the creeps!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game. you don't have to spend any money on this game.  if you just upgrade your bow sword and the farmers and archers you will go a long way.  of course you need to upgrade the gate and maybe the village archers. love this game
B0071MDA2U|5.0|I liked it! Can't wait until the next book in the series is out. Let's you think about how different you would have to think as a society to live like that.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game and I'm only making a review so i can gt free updates lol this game is good but its like a Mario remix. it has 2 much momentum so its somewhat hard to control the character if ur not used to it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this oz by far the best angry birds game. also don't worry he update is coming soon. epic epic epic epic
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Thankfully this has a sliver of a star above Pearl Harbor. This film is a 4-5 star historical action flick. It has the perfect blend of history, drama, and action all rolled into one amazing film. The story in and of itself is fascinating and when you add in the great acting, insane action, and well crafted characters you have one killer film. I was moved and engaged and on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. I think it's a shame it only has 3.5 stars here only a nudge away from that garbage Pearl Harbor. This film was worth owning and watching again and again. That film was a wreck at best. Pick it up, you will not be disappointed.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It's a very fun game. Not sure how long I'll keep playing it but it is quite entertaining for the time being. Currently playing on an Acer Iconia A500 without any bugs or glitches.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I think it's awesome because there is a robot flying in the sky and it looks cool and it gives me some thing to play for a while.
0062119044|5.0|What a ride this book is, day by day account of life with a child who is unreachable and radiates malice or maybe a mother who does. I honestly found it impossible to know who was to blame for the harm done in this excellent and addictive book.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Everything about this set is fantastic.  The sound is unbelievable and the visual upgrade is like night & day.  The scene when the T-rex escapes had me smiling the whole time, the sound and visuals are fantastic.  Turn it up loud and have a blast.
B004SEUJNM|5.0|I remember growing up and having watched Rocky several times in my adolences...my family and I loved it.  It's truly a classic!  Why I never previously owned this title, on DVD or otherwise, is beyond me, but I figured it was high time I scooped it up for my collection.  I found this edition of it for a reasonable price and felt it would be perfect for my collection, being a limited editino version with book & all the features.  My movie collection is a bit more complete now that I have this movie.
0525478817|5.0|I fell in love with Hazel and Gus, my heart ached for these kids and wanted to read more and more about their love. Read it, but don't start late at night! You won't be able to put it down!
B004SEUJKU|5.0|Although Terminator 2 is definitely the best Terminator film, as many people would agree, Terminator was still a classic, defining sci-fi film that deserves worthy credit without a shadow of a doubt.  The original Terminator helped in definining the sci-fi action movie industry and is, in my opinion and many other people's opinion, one of the all time best sci-fi movies of all time.  I had previously already upgraded Terminator 2 to Blu-Ray, but I figured it was time to also do the same with the original Terminator, because it's no less deserving of that in my opinion.  Just like Alien 1 & 2, so is Terminator 1 and 2 as far as classic awesomeness.  I recently encountered this addition of Terminator on Blu-Ray and decided that I simply had to have this edition of it, and now I do.  Many of the younger generation of nerds/geeks out there I've ever talked to are not familiar with these films, and I made sure to let them know that they needed to look into them.  Sure, they're a bit older and the special effects are decidedly not the most amazing, but they're still awesome films that every sci-fi & action lover should watch, so if you're reading this and you have never seen the Terminator films, or even the Alien films for that matter, get on it!
B005VCL4PW|5.0|I was impressed with the condition of this hardcover book. The jacket was in excellent condition and so were all of the pages within. The shipping was not too bad either.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book so much!  The disjointed stories were a great read and flow, it made it very easy to pick the book up and read a persons story then stop and pick it up again quickly later.  His VERY realistic view of how events would play out and be dealt with was a refreshing contrast to most horror zombie flicks.  I recommend this book to any SHTF type of person or lover of zombie culture.  I enjoyed this one a lot more than his previous book.
B004FHCH96|3.0|Just a warning to future purchasers:  The Blu Ray version of Memento does not contain the easter egg from the dvd edition where you can watch the movie in order.  That's the only reason I bought this, since I've seen it several times already.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|All I can say really is this keyboard app is awesome.  I've tried a lot of the others and this one has jut been the best for me.<br /><br />Only thing I wish it had (and any other android keyboard app) was the ability to add emails to the dictionary so you can easily auto complete them.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I'll start with how different this one seems to me. Different from the last Slash work. Different from any of the GNR work. Different from what I expected. Judge that as you see it. Different could be good.<br /><br />Most of the songs haven't grown on me yet, but I'm not going to say they won't. \\"Standing in the sun\\" is an exciting song that summons up the old power classic \\"Locomotive.\\" To be honest, I'm not really crazy about the single \\"You're a lie.\\" \\"Anastasia\\" has a mind blowing introduction and is perhaps my favorite song on the album. \\"Not for me\\" is a deep song and a little closer to Alterbridges catalogue. \\"Bad rain\\" is dark and creepy song, and a sweet surprise that wakes me up toward the end of the album-- it's always great when an album gets better as it progresses instead of having a few good songs up front and then all crappy fillers at the end. This album actually gets better toward the end. \\"Far and away\\" is a sure winner-- bluesy, deep lyrics, and beautiful guitar work. The two bonus songs not on the CD I bought, \\"Carolina\\" and \\"Crazy life\\" are good rockers worth picking up as bonus tracks.<br /><br />Overall, this is an album that has a little something for everyone. I don't know if it's better than the last Slash disc, but time will tell. I think this collaboration is just the beginning of something great. Slash, Kennedy, Fitz, and Kerns are a solid live band with great chemistry. I saw them live the last time around and they were great, so I look forward to seeing them again and hearing some of these new tunes live.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I'll preface this by saying I HATE sports, all sports, but I love this book.  The true basis of this book is a story of sticking it to the \\"good old boys\\" club by using pure hard facts, science, and statistics.  It is really hard to believe these people were so dumb set in their ways to try to stop the introduction of fact into the sport of baseball.  There's plenty of solid back story and scientific information to keep any non-sports fan interested especially since they approach baseball from an analytical perspective and not a sport perspective.
B001AOKA3W|1.0|Thank god for the fast forward button. If I wanted a hand held camera movie about terror I'd film my ex-wives. The few good parts of this movie could be condensed into a 3 minute short.
B005LAIGP0|3.0|It's a shame that this atmospheric retelling of Susan Hill's superb novel is so bloodless. Both an earlier British TV film and the long-running London stage version outclass it in sheer chills. Less is always more in a ghost story, but in this THE WOMAN IN BLACK the reasoning seems to be \\"If one wind-up Victorian toy is scary, seventeen of them will be terrifying!\\" With apologies, no, it doesn't work that way. The central set-piece, Arthur's aural \\"witnessing\\" of a long-ago fatal carriage accident in the dangerous, all-encompassing and impenetrable mist of Eel Marsh is rushed through, but there is seemingly endless footage of a game but green Daniel Radcliffe wandering around the haunted mansion. The movie is way out of proportion, and the ending (SPOILER) seems to want to have it both ways, both gloom and happiness. Buy it for the superb production values and the sterling supporting cast, but this version of THE WOMAN IN BLACK will not haunt your dreams.
0385340990|5.0|This book is absolutely charming! We read it for my book club a few months ago and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. What a fantastic and delightful story!

B0061S073A|5.0|kids can still access apps by simply hitting the app shortcut button and selecting the ones they want to access, thus completely bypassing Kids Place.  i was under the impression that those apps selected by parents would only be accessable with a PIN, instead it's that you cant exit the Kids Place app, once activated.  Would be better with a widget so that kids can simply go to that one centralized location without further assistance from the device owner.

0793542049|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  I'm just starting to play bass guitar, and this seemed like just the thing.  However, I'm not sure they are able to decide who their audience is supposed to be.  The book starts with a very basic introduction to music (the basic scale, notes, etc) ... then jumps straight into the bass lines. It's like moving from the 1-level course to a 4-level course in a couple of pages.  Couple that with the music, which is represented only in conventional notation, with no tabs.  Yes, I know, I can figure out the tabs from the sheet music.  However, how much would it have taken for the author to do this??  Well, one day, I'm sure I'll be good enough to actually use it.  Right now, just too painful.

B000002KKC|5.0|This album rivals Rumours, in my opinion. Not sure why it didn't do so well, though. The gems are: Sara, Angel, Sisters of the Moon, Brown Eyes, Honey Hi, Walk A Thin Line, Tusk, and Beautiful Child. Every Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie song is wonderful on here -- Lindsey not so much, but he was in his \\"experimental\\" phase, I suppose.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This was a good book and I enjoyed reading it. It had lots of facts about the war. I spent some time on Okinawa in 1952 and three. There were still signs of the war when I was there. And it's it very interesting for me.<br />Marv Hammell
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I caught the series first on BBC America and wanted to see what had been edited out. Very good program with good/great actors and directing. Everyone should check it out
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Product is a rip off, read the reviews anywhere and everyone says the same thing. THIS THING WILL STOP WORKING. Its a terrible product and the company should be ashamed of their selves for ripping people off so obviously. Just spend three more dollars and make a better product, that works for more than a few weeks, seriously. it's just an expensive p.o.s
B007HO392S|5.0|The item came very quickly and was in perfect condition. As to the actual product itself I am very very happy. It's a great album, quite dark but has a few upbeat songs on it as well. It feels like Carrie's really let herself go with this album and not be constrained what people are expecting or what \\"country music\\" should sound like. I particularly love the addition of One Way Ticket - completely unexpected but the sound, though reggae tinged is definitely her own. A definite must be and not likely to grow stale as the songs are so varied without sounding like a completely different artist.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|It would have been 5 stars if the tutorial was better... it took me a little while to figure it out. But overall it is a great game. Don't think I would have bought it but getting it on the FAOTD, it was a good find.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I love this case. It doesn't slide around, but isn't annoying to move either. I enjoy the feel and texture. Kindle fire fixes nicely, and doesn't cover up the speaker (which is right where the clip that hold the device are). Love it!

This book give us a true insiders look at the good, the bad and the fascinating. Read it.

0439023521|5.0|I rejected every invitation to read this book since it was compared to the much overhyped Twilight series. But I'm so glad I caved, because I was up till stupid o' clock for 3 nights just trying to finish the whole trilogy - I seriously couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Suzanne Collins imagination is genius - the plot was properly thought-out and intricate, the writing style was straightforward but very descriptive allowing each scene to be crisp in one's mind. It's been 7 years since I was a teen, but perhaps everyone above 20 who loves this book is just simple-minded since most negative critics claim only young adults are supposed to find it enjoyable. Well, I very much liked its directness and the fact that it was not loaded with excessive and unnecessary literary fluff...therefore leaving more room for the actual storyline to be the focus.<br /><br />My greatest fear was that it would be too graphic with kids killing kids, and I for one don't do well with gruesome. But Collins did well by reducing the goriness of almost all the deaths, and also by not letting us get too attached to the rest of the tributes (well, except Rue); which somehow made the deaths a lot more tolerable.<br /><br />One bone I do have to pick is why Collins made Katniss's character so unlikeable. I wanted to like her, not only because she was the main character but she was also a martyr; and that was the right thing to do. But boy, did I struggle! Why did she have to be so bland, and stoic? It seemed to me like the author herself was confused about how to portray Katniss to the readers. Was she a hero? If yes, why was she was constantly in self-defense mode? Was she a sweetheart? No, not with that lack of emotion. Heck! Even drunk Haymitch had a little more personality. Perhaps there is a reason for this that would be revealed in the next 2 parts of the series. I am optimistic, so I will hold my breath.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a captivating book, almost impossible not to feel likeyou were right there in the arena.

0439023491|3.0|This second book of the trilogy slows down the pace by presenting a bigger picture of Panem instead of just focusing on the games. We also finally get a LITTLE bit of genuine romance (not one forced by the Capitol). *rubs hands in glee*<br /><br />Didn't like that most of the characters were forgettable though, and that the arena was more descriptions and less action. Actually, sometimes I had to flip back a few pages to remind myself who the tributes were, what district they were from, and if they were the \\"friend or enemy\\". Plus I wasn't sure how to root for Peeta (yes Peeta, not Katniss), if all the other tributes were so harmless & likable. I definitely didn't want them to die a gruesome death and again, I am grateful for Collins sensitivity to her squeamish audience and for giving us undisturbing and even boring killings.<br /><br />I was still a bit irritated by Katniss, even though at a point I started to understand why her actions were annoying like so. After all she's only 17 years old, and she has a lot of pent up emotion from: her father's death, being strong for her entire family, and of course the emotional trauma from the games. She may have just been overwhelmed by the responsibility of being the face of rebellion, while also being a confused teenager who just wants to have normal male crushes that don't involve life and death decisions. Also, because I am a sucker for romance and I really like Peeta (and Peeta likes her...doh!), I tried to tolerate her a lot more in this book. It's also worth noting that Collins tried to give us more of Gale, I guess to promote the rather weak love triangle. Not sure if anyone bought into that - Peeta FTW!<br /><br />Overall, this book dragged on for longer than it should have without enough of the nail-biting action that made the first book such a winner for me. It was enjoyable nonetheless, but I am still holding my breath -MockingJay, please don't fail me.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is a concert version of the musical. As such the principles stand before a mike to sing and there are fewer movements on stage than there are in the acted version. But what makes this Blue-Ray DVD worthwhile are the outstanding performance. I have never seen a better Inspector Javert. Eponine is absolutely fantastic. Gavroche is very entertaining. Young Cossette is a heart-breaker. The addition of a very large supporting chorus only enhances the overall concert. I don't purchase many DVDs, but since I really enjoy this show, I like watching this one time and time again.
0439023513|3.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />It was hard for me not to despise Katniss by the time I got to the end of this book. The romance I had been rooting for throughout the series fell flat - dull, uninspiring, depressing even. Peeta never really recovered, and Katniss remained self-absorbed, melancholic and like she was doing Peeta a favor by giving him kids. Seems like Collins forgot what really kept a lot of readers going - we were rooting for Peeta (and Katniss...I guess). We wanted him to be better; we wanted to feel like his post-trackerjacker suffering was not in vain. Perhaps Peeta should have been killed off; we may have been enraged but we would have been okay, we would have had better closure than this half-baked ending. If you ask me he was too good for her anyway, but we just wanted a \\"good\\" ending.<br /><br />Even the uprising that supposedly overshadowed the romance was so blah! The Capitol had been overcome but there was no feeling of triumph, no hope for the next generation, no feeling that the last 2 books were worth the fight and loss of life. I had mentally braced myself for the graphic, horrific, violent scene that would be the torture of the villain. He/She was supposed to die a slow, torturous, painful and nightmare inducing death. I couldn't believe how disappointing it all turned out to be. At this point, I'm not even sure who the real villain was. I know the vote on the games/Coin's death/rose on Snow was supposed to be thought-provoking, but the story had become so disjointed at that point that I couldn't be bothered to appreciate it. It was all so anti-climactic that I wish I stopped at the second book; perhaps I would have been satisfied with imagining my own ending.<br /><br />Finally, there was no continuity in this final series. Gale ended up in district 2 - no more explanation. I think SC forgot how hard she tried to make him a relevant factor in the first 2 books. What in the world happened to Johanna? And Katniss, the girl who SC had been trying to convince us was the girl on fire ended up being an empty, hollow shell of herself. Not in a war veteran type of way either, but more in a hopeless why-did-we-even-go-to-war manner.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend the whole trilogy because they are all good reads that would keep you going because you want to know what happens in the end. However, I think we deserved a better ending after all the build up from the first two books.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I saw this movie five times! I loved it so much. Not only am I a zac efron freak but i am also an Abigail breslin fan so this movie was really good. They did a great job. It had a great story. It was amazing!! Totally worth seeing! Don't let negative people tell you not to see it. Let them stick to their OWN opinion and you do the same.<br /><br />Don't let people tell you what to see and what not to see. Its not their life. so I say go see this movie!!!! I give it five stars!!<br /><br />-Chloe
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I could not put it down and was a quick read.  Yes, the writing isn't all that great, but it doesn't stop you from reading.  Men and women should both read this book as it will lead you to interesting conversations.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|The Name of the Wind is one of those rare books that consumes you from beginning to end. There is a casual quality to Rothfuss' writing that unobtrusively draws you into his world, introducing you to his characters in the intimate manner of a fireside story teller. He makes you feel like you are part of the story; albeit not an active participant, but a witness to the events unfolding around you.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. However, I would be remiss if I did not call out a couple points that I stumbled on a bit. The first is somewhat of a flaw in the main character (Kvothe) who is built up to be of unsurpassed intelligence. Yet, Kvothe is unable to extricate himself from various situations that should be academic to one of such lofty intelligence, even as a youth. The second (and final) point is perhaps a matter of opinion, but I felt the plot (not the writing, mind you) dragged a little and leaves you hanging at the end. That said, I still give The Name of the Wind a 5 stars out of 5 rating because it really was that enjoyable to read. Rothfuss is a truly gifted writer who had me hanging on every sentence, and I am looking forward to continuing the adventure on which he has enlisted me and the many readers who have enjoyed this book before me. Well done, Mr. Rothfuss. Well done indeed.<br /><br />For other \\"coming of age\\" fantasy, try:<br />[[ASIN:B004ZUWSCO Rogue's Honor (Honor Bound saga)]]
0312641893|3.0|In a story where fairy tale meets sci-fi, the title character, Cinder, has been dealt a tough hand in life. She has no memory of her life before the surgery that changed her into half human, half machine. As a cyborg, she has no rights and is regarded as an embarrassment and a mistake. Cinder earns her living (or rather the living of her evil stepmother, Adri) as a mechanic, fixing androids - which is how she meets Prince Kai, the handsome future Emperor of the Eastern Commonwealth.<br /><br />Yet life takes a dramatic turn for the worse when Cinder's one friend, her sister Peony, gets stricken by letumosis, a deadly pandemic. Adri volunteers Cinder for plague research - an honor no one has survived yet.<br /><br />Throw in political intrigue, a beautiful-but-evil Lunar queen, interesting world building, and some plot twists and turns, and you have an engagingly written, very readable story. Kai and Linh Cinder are likable, charming characters.<br /><br />Why not more stars? The big mystery about Cinder's past is really not a mystery. Any reasonably astute reader should figure it out without much difficulty very early on. And solving that non-mystery is really the one big story arc - the book leaves Cinder's overall story unfinished, merely building up to the sequel(s). When I buy a book, I expect *some* sort of semi-satisfying ending - this book really didn't have one. Many other books designed to be part of a series still manage to have finished, satisfying story arcs in each book. This just left me going 'That's it???' by the non-end.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a simple design, but elegantly done. The controls are extremely easy to figure out. And the puzzles are challenging but fun to solve. It has nice, relaxing music, and the screens are easy on the eyes. I would recommend this app to all puzzle solvers. You'll get hours of enjoyment out of it.

B004QXJZXA|5.0|If you want to watch a movie with a good story and engaging dialog, I suggest you skip this one. If you are interested in racing don't pass this one up! I would guess over 80% of the movie is racing, real racing. To film this movie they actually qualified a car to enter the race. Most of the racing sequences are taken from a camera mounted in a car that was racing at the time. At one point in the filming the car used to film the movie had a very real chance of winning the race but it was decided by the team their goal was to make the movie and not win the race. The cars are beautiful, the sound causes the heart to pound a little faster, and the drama of the race still sucks me in no matter how many times I watch it. I think it is the best racing movie ever made! The quality of the picture and sound are equal to what I remember from seeing it in the theater. I seldom watch all the add ons that come with a movie but the making of feature of this blu-ray was as interesting as the movie. Like racing? Don't miss this one!

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|\\"Wasting Light\\" is simply the best rock album I have heard in years.  Foo Fighters always puts out good music, but this is their best work yet.  Grohl's songwriting ability is amazing, the instrumentation, arrangements and production are extremely well done, and quite honestly, every song on the album could stand on its own.  Nevertheless, a few random comments are in order:<br /><br />\\"Rope\\" is one of the most rocking songs I've ever heard.<br />\\"Dear Rosemary,\\" \\"Arlandria,\\" and \\"These Days\\" each has especially excellent lyrical content.  (Perhaps my favorite lyrics are the chorus of \\"These Days.\\")<br />As an added bonus, the music videos for \\"Rope\\" and \\"Walk\\" are way cool.<br /><br />Basically, I have no doubt that 30 years hence, people will still be listening to and excited about \\"Wasting Light.\\"

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Superficially it's a story about sex but on a deeper level it's about two people with their insecurities trying to make it work out.
B007SGM084|2.0|I thought that if this book has made the headlines something must be good, right? I won't complain too much but I think it was a waste of money. Repetitive sex, almost boring after the first few times, is there a plot? I actually wished the characters weren't so predictable and wishy washy. It played out like a modern day x rated fairytale without a morale lesson at the end. My advice, read the first book but skip the others as nothing will surprise you or add to the story. Yawn....

B00002SWEM|5.0|If you are looking for something with a focused story, this isn't it, but if you want a glimpse into the rich tradition of Cuban music infused with Havana street scenes, you can't do better. The importance of music in the Cuban culture is evident. You see the cramped housing filled with old furniture, the streets lined with cars from before the 1959 revolution, many rusting and barely operable. Havana is like a car museum that someone neglected. But among all this are the people and their music. Ibrahim Ferrer expresses the character of the Cuban people when he states that if they made \\"things\\" important in their lives, they would have perished long ago. These musicians are remembered and revered by their people and we get a chance to see the joy that this music gives to those who make it, those who remember it and those who hear it for the first time.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't remember how I first heard about the Wool series.  It must have popped up on my Kindle as a Prime option so I checked it out just because I've been reading a few different dystopian-type novels.  I read the Hunger Games a few months ago and enjoyed them, but the Silo series beats that by leaps and bounds.  Disclaimer:  I'm not a huge science fiction fan, and I don't pretend to be, but my previous favorite in the genre was probably the Bender series by Orson Scott Card.<br /><br />I am SO glad I stumbled on this!  I voraciously consumed it within a week (the entire Omnibus) then bought and devoured the 6th in the Silo series (Legacy) and am now reading Hugh's \\"Molly Hyde\\" series.  He is seriously on my very short list of favorite authors.  He has a way of telling a story that draws you in and won't let you go until the last page, without dumbing it down (especially when it comes to Edison from the Molly Hyde series!)<br /><br />I returned the Omnibus to Amazon's Prime lending library, and then I bought it.  This is something I will read again and again.  I think my husband will enjoy it too, even though sci-fi isn't his normal genre either.<br /><br />Oh, and the comparisons to the Shades of Porn series?  THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  That is truly laughable, to even put the \\"middle aged woman's fantasy\\" of bondage, S&M and whatever else on the same level as the Silo series.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I debated on purchasing the third book because of the mixed reviews but I am glad I did. Overall it is a great book. The ending is disapointing, it seems almost as if Collins ran out of time and had to rush the ending to meet a deadline.
B007SGM084|2.0|I love my Kindle but I guess I'll be buying this in book form.  Why can I buy this at a cheaper price in book form?  Something needs to be done about your prices.  Come on give us a break on the pricing, pleeeease......
B007C3TVEY|5.0|This film is so amazing .<br />Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller were so  invested in their roles it was impossible to take your eyes off of them. It felt like a time bomb that you knew was going to go off but you never knew when, how or how big of a bang it would be.<br /><br />The character of Kevin 'Ezra Miller' was one of the most chilling characters I have seen in a film in years and the fact that he was basically a kid made it all the more freaky.<br /><br />The story played out in three different time frames going back and forth from one to the other. Some people felt put out by this but I like this type of film  in the vein of Pulp Fiction.<br />You basically know the majority of what is going to happen at the climax but then again I wasn't ready for all of it.<br /><br />It's a very tense ,taunt thriller that will keep your interest and on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />There are several seemingly simple scenes that made me cry which was genius on the part of the director such subtle touches but so effective.I give this the ultimate thumbs up..
0316044695|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books I've ever read.  It is so well written, you would think it was written by a proffesional author.  It grabbed my attention from the moment I opened it and I had a hard time putting it down.

B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I saw this movie back when it came out in 1997, and I enjoyed it.  It was a different type of alien science fiction movie, but now that 15 years have passed, I saw it on T.V. recently, and decided to order it.  I now appreciate it much more now, not just for the nostalgic feel to it (I had just left the space industry a year before I first saw the movie in theatres), but can now appreciate so much more the human element and human nature that is involved in such an important undertaking as contacting alien civilizations.  Carl Sagan wrote a great story, and Jodie Foster is such a great actress.  Not to mention, she is just so gosh darn cute!!
0307477479|5.0|This was easily the best book I have read in the last 10 years, one that stays with you always. I think about it often.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My son loved this movie! It is a must have for anyone with small children. The animation is far superior to their prior movies. Dave plays his best part yet & the action just keeps your child engrossed in the film. They really picked a great sound track for this film as well. I would give this film an A.
0345803493|3.0|I bought this book after reading the first hoping it had the same effect on me but by the middle of it I was sadly disappointed. I found myself finishing the book just to see how it ended not so much out of interest. I was so annoyed and fed up with the same argument arising in Ana and Christians relationship: \\"is Ana enough\\" \\"is Christian ready to give up the BDSM\\" \\"do they trust each other\\" was the same argument every time! It was irritating and would be followed up with the same thing, Christian giving Ana that look that would touch her \\"down there.\\" *yawn*<br /><br /> I found myself questioning the validity of the scenarios really happening and found a lot of it hard to believe. I felt like Ana would rightfully question some of Christians actions like his overprotective and overbearing nature, his overly controlling ways but once he would stare at her in that tired \\"mercurial\\" way it would be a wrap and she'd fall under his spell. *double yawn*<br /><br />I guess what really bothered me about this one was I was ready for them to truely lock it down and be together and I wished it would've happened sooner in the book or load up the meat of the book with much more drama. Like real drama. Like Christian falling back in with Mrs. Robinson or Ana hooking up with Taylor or something!! Lol maybe not with Taylor but someone!! I agree with some of the previous comments that the author must have spent a weekend reading and highlighting the thesaurus because some of the vocab was a bit pretentious and actually kinda sickening lol. Some of their conversations I was just like bleh. This book was a snooze fest and a half and I don't think I want to risk getting the third.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|A very fun game for anybody but it was kind of hard at first a blast for everybody so much fun.
B0071NLG0W|2.0|I very much enjoyed the first two books in the Amber Fox Series, which is why I bought the 3rd.  I was very much disappointed in it, and, in the future, will check the content of a book more thoroughly before buying.
0345803485|4.0|this book was well written and i liked to the characters a lot. christian is a very unique character and i was intrigued the whole time. it's not as sexually oriented as i thought it would be, which was nice. over all a good read.<br /><br />you either don't mind reading about a little S&M or you do.... you're choice....but I don't think you shouldn't base the book on if you like S&M or not
B007JM4CWY|1.0|I was so excited to download this app since nonograms are my favorite puzzles, but my excitement was short lived when I discovered there is no function to mark a straight line of several cells.  Instead you have to individually mark each one, which I find to be extremely tedious, which took the fun out of it for me.  I also do not recommend this app for smaller devices.  It is a struggle to mark an individual cell without accidentally hitting a surrounding cell instead.  If there is a magnifying function, I never did discover it.
0345803485|1.0|I hate to write bad reviews for anything.  Given how well this book has done in the marketplace, I wanted to see what the hubbaloo was about.  I have to say I am mystified as to how so many people were taken in by this book. Maybe too many women have unsatisfying sex lives and thought this book was naughty enough to fit the bill.  For me it certainly didn't hit any erotic nerve at all. There is nothing about it that goes beyond the simplistic or doesn;t require the reader to suspend all disbelief to incredible levels.  A billionaire at 26? Come on! Apparently Christian Grey was someone's study hall fantasy back in high school.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is probably one of the most trite, redundant and thoroughly disappointing \\"books\\" I have ever read.  I have seen adolescents write more erotic scenes than were in this book. Is the public so starved for decent erotica that this even qualifies? It's nothing but endless pages of very poor repetitious writing where nothing is resolved. If you are a huge fan of UST (unrelieved sexual tension) by all means, this book is for you. The characters are unbelievable. No man is that perfect, no woman is orgasmic at every turn and most American college students (especially female) rarely uses the strikingly British vocabulary that the narrator does.<br /><br />E L James really needs to stick with being a television executive and leave the writing to others. I have read far, far, better  fanfiction on places such as Dreamwidth, Livejournal, Insanejournal, and Fanfic dot net which would absolutely bury this over-hyped dreck.  What fascinates me is how this series could possibly have become a bestseller at all. I think it's the marketing of this book and how it could possibly have captured such a wide audience is really what's important. That way those of us who know how to write can also cash in with our extant body of work.<br /><br />EDIT: If you want to see a really funny parody /takeoff of this book, check out the \\"Fifty Shades of Chicken\\" book trailer narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart on YouTube.  I promise the giggles will make you forget E.L. James' book.Shades of Chicken\\" book trailer narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart on YouTube.  I promise the giggles will make you forget E.L. James' book.
0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay was a huge disappointment.  Collins did such a good job with the first two books.  What happened?  Was she in a hurry?  Was she replaced by a ghost writer?  Even the voice seems to have changed.  The dark humor is gone and all that is left is the dark.  As the book ends you see children dancing on a mass grave.  Why?  Left me feeling ill.

0345803493|4.0|I didn't expect to like the \\" Fifty Shades\\"  trilogy.  I started by purchasing the first book.  I ended up buying and reading all three.  Lots of pathology but I couldn't put the books down! I've been having a difficult time finding any interesting books after I read \\"Cutting for Stone\\" and the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" trilogy.  Not sure if \\"Fifty Shades\\" is for everyone but haven't found any of my friends who couldn't read the books.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Overall, I liked the movie. I thought it was much better made than the campy overrated Twilight movies. But I did have a few issues with the film. I was hopping the beginning would have more scenes involving Katniss with her mother and sister. Why did they change the way she received the mockingjay pin? Where was the district 12 mayor and his daughter (I can't remember her name.)?The training and pre-events were too long.. I read several reviews of the movie before I watched it and they all talked about the graphic violence. In my opinion the violence was toned down compared to the book, probably to get a PG-13 rating. In the book, didn't Katniss shoot Marvel in the neck and not the stomach? Didn't Rue's district send Katniss a loaf of bread? What was up with the hound-like creatures? In the book the hounds resembled the fallen Tributes. Does anyone recall the soundtrack that was released in March with Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars, and others? Besides from a few songs during the ending credits, the others were missing in action.<br /><br />Like I said, I liked the movie. It was better made than what I expected it to be.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|After becoming addictive to watching reruns on ABC Family and Soap.net, I stumbled upon the Gilmore Girls season one and two bundled together for under twenty dollars at a Target Store. After quickly going through the first season, a few days later I started watching the second season. A week went by and I had finished watching it. I realized that the series was aimed for a female audience, but for some reason it clicked with me, mostly because I caught Lorelai and Rory constantly drinking coffee, and I have always liked Lauren Graham ever since I saw her in Bad Santa.<br /><br />Season 2 picks up where the first season finale ended, with Lorelai finally saying \\"yes\\" to Max's marriage proposal and Rory starts up her relationship with Dean again. I found it odd that the first few episodes are set during the summer, as in most TV series the start of season takes place three months later, where the kids are going back to school. The first three episodes involve planning for the upcoming wedding, which never really happens as Lorelai calls it off. The following episode has Rory and her on a road trip to visit Harvard; well it was more like crashing and is my favorite episode now. Lorelai's love life is ignored through most of the season besides from a few scenes with Rory's father who ends up going nowhere. Rory's love life is the man focus as she is torn between her sweetheart Dean and Luke's troubled nephew Jess.<br /><br />Between the smart dialogue, quirky characters, and the coffee drinking, I absolutely love this show, and I regret never watching it during its original run. Luke (the owner of Luke's Diner) is the most relatable character for me. From his casual style, ruddiness/crankiness, and attitude, all in which reminds me of myself, except for his dislike of coffee. Or course I like Lorelai for her smart-ass attitude and Rory's love of books. What I didn't care for was the character Jess, who is just an annoying troublemaker. I was laughing out loud when Luke shoved Jess into the lake.shoved Jess into the lake.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Let me start by saying, Garbage has been my favorite band since 1998.  The good news is...they still are!<br /><br />I received the CD about two hours ago and am happy to say I LOVE IT!  Fifteen tracks of greatness...really.  If you're a Gabage fan already, you'll love this album....if you're not, you will become one, and then have four other great albums to buy (lucky you)!<br /><br />What else can I tell you...\\"writing about music\\" is about as useful as \\"dancing about arcitecture\\", so just get the album, listen to it and then you too will love it.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|While flipping through channels a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Gilmore Girls. I recall when the series was first aired in 2000 and for some reason I never got around to watching an episode. What caught my eye was that Lauren Graham was constantly carrying around a cup of coffee, which so do I. After twenty minutes of viewing and listening to the snappy dialogue, I was now a fan. A few days later I went to a Target store in the city and found seasons one and two bundled together for twenty dollars.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is set in the small, wacky town of Stars Hollows, where single mother Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham), manager of the Independence Inn, is raising her sixteen-year-old daughter Rory (played Alexis Bledel). When her daughter is accepted into the Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai asks her rich estranged parents for financial help due to the school's expensive tuition. Of course things are not so simple as her parents want them to have Friday night dinners with them and be an active involvement in their lives.<br /><br />Besides from Lorelai and Rory's addiction to coffee, I like their quirky personalities. Lorelai is a fun and carefree mother, while Rory is a Harvard bound book nerd. The dialogue between the two is smart, snappy, and more real than other scripted shows. There are other colorful characters on the show as well, such as Luke Danes who owns the local diner; Lane Kim, Rory's best friend (When the series started the actress was 27 playing a 16 year-old.); and Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and head chef at the Independence Inn (played by Melissa McCarthy).<br /><br />In just over a week, I watched the entire first season, but I did skip over a few that I had already seen. Even though the show is almost twelve years old, I find it to be a bit of fresh air compared to other horribly scripted shows on network television today.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I'm not aware of any other artist/performer with such a perfect sense of how to make great pop songs.  I've been a Madonna fan for literally 30 years.  The sheer number of truly great songs by Madonna is breathtaking, inspiring and unique.<br /><br />MDNA does not disappoint...which considering how completely great the rest of her albums are...is saying quite a lot.  It's always dangerous to have such high expectations, but if anyone can deliver it's Madonna, and she certainly does with MDNA.
0345803485|1.0|This book was purchased for me.  I agreed to try reading it.  The one thing I could not move past is the First-Person present viewpoint.  This viewpoint is rarely used for a reason.  Who writes this way?  This is not a Twist-a-plot...although I might have found it more entertaining if it were.  Neither could I move past the number of technical errors.  Too many, seriously.  The transitions need attention as they simply aren't there.  The story jumps from point A to point C with no means of getting there.  The characters are underdeveloped, two dimensional, flat.<br /><br />I understand this is fan fiction that started in an online version and was modified for publication.  I AM trying to finish the book as someone I love spent money for it.  However, I find it seriously boring, slow to start and even slower toward the middle.  The story idea is good--if only the writer would have taken some time to learn the trade first.  Best advice: don't purchase it as a gift unless the soul actually requests it.  It's not that good.  If you're a Twilight fan, you might possibly enjoy the connection that the fan fiction presents; if you are not, don't buy into the hype.<br /><br />I did finish it, finally.  I still do not like it.  I don't agree that it is erotica as it seemed more like a sexual fantasy of a middle-aged, lonely woman.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoy this book. It is charming. I fell in love with Christian even though he is so weird. I hope everybody can enjoy it as I did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading this. Everything that could possible be said about this book has already been mentioned in the nearly 800 reviews so far, so I just want to highlight what an amazing breath of fresh air this is. It started as a western, turned into a mystery book, and then evolved into a conspiracy book Dan Brown would be jealous of (for the writing, as well); all this while staying true to the sci-fi setting. Very highly recommended, and I'm very much looking forward to see what this author brings us next.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|For the record, I hate science fiction of any kind, futuristic end of the world stuff, vampires, werewolves, soppy romance and anything I perceive as being not real.  I even hated fairy tales as a child.  The Wizard of Oz gave me nightmares.<br />So what on earth, you might ask with tears in your eyes, was I doing downloading a copy of The Hunger Games onto my Kindle?<br />This is not a genre I ever read.<br />Well, there was so much hype about The Hunger Games I became curious.  I wanted to see why this book was number 1 for like forever.<br />To my surprise I loved the book.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it over a weekend and didn't feed my family.<br />The Hunger Games is well-written and has just the right amount of balance.  It felt real.  There were no aliens with 8 eyeballs to give me nightmares.  The plot was a tried and tested one.  Girl meets boy and has to overcome challenges to find love.  What made this a nail-bitingly good read was all the action, the cliff-hangers, the hooks, and the twists and the types of challenges that set this book apart from the rest.<br />One almost forgot it was a YA novel.<br />I loved it!

B004QOB8SO|5.0|When Conan-Doyle created Sherlock Holmes in the late 1800's, Homes and his methods were very cutting edge and progressive.  No one used fingerprints, had chemicals to detect blood, or used deduction before Holmes.  But Holmes (Conan-Doyle) \\"created\\" new technologies and used his deductive capabilities to draw amazing conclusions.  If Conan-Doyle were alive today, THIS would be his Sherlock Holmes.  Now there is blogging instead of agony columns and the internet rather than the telegraph.  Progressive, inventive, and very Conan-Doyle, this series is entertaining and engaging.  If you are expecting a 19th century re-make, you will be disappointed.  But if love the spirit of a technologically advanced and forward thinking Conan Doyle, you won't be disappointed.

0240815807|5.0|The title of this review says it all.  This is one of the best, most enjoyable and concise instructional books I've ever read about any subject.  To be honest, mixing is a pretty dry subject.  This book actually makes it fun!  But more importantly, it covers very minute and important details regarding frequencies, compression, reverberation, parallel compression....etc..etc in a very easy to understand AND in depth manner.  I'll be honest, I hated mixing and really didnt have a natural aptitude for it.  After reading this book, I look foreward to it and have a lot more confidence in my ability to tackle a lot of problems and issues that would have completely stumped me before.  Buy this book, it is, in every sense of the expression, a no brainier if you want to learn more about mixing your own recordings.

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time has quickly become an addition to my list of favorite books. Mark Haddon manages to blend humor, sadness, and suspense in an intricate puzzle of a novel that leaves you amazed. At the beginning of the book, you might believe a small child is telling the story due to the simplistic language and innocent observations, but eventually you realize the narrator, Christopher, is a 15 year old boy. It is never said explicitly in the novel, but Christopher exhibits the mental impairments of someone with an autistic spectrum disorder. He<br />is literal to a fault, highly logical, socially impaired, and cannot stand physical contact.  This novel really forces you to think about what life is like for someone like this who is trapped inside his own mind. Christopher is a genius in so many regards; he is highly observant, can do complex math equations faster than most of us can do simple arithmetic, and exhibits a Sherlock-Holmes-esque ability to work through the logistics of his world. Christopher is brilliant in all these regards, but he misses out on many creative and social experiences in his life due to his mental impairment. The reader can see his thought processes, listen to the way he thinks, and understand how logical and sound his mind is as it works through his life. However, we also see how odd his behavior actually is in relation to the real world, no matter how rational his thoughts are.  I found this unique viewpoint and writing style incredibly compelling. This book is a mystery in more ways than one, and with such a limited, fragmented view of the world, as shown through the lens of Christopher's unique perspective, the puzzle is even more rewarding when the reader can eventually piece it together. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a fascinating read that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a classic mystery employing a deductive reasoning style and a new kind of narrative perspective.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I love real science fiction, not that sword and sorcery, fantasy stuff and after reading this author's [[ASIN:B003QCIPGK Half Way Home]], I just had to read more of his work.  This is excellent writing and I was obliged to read this because the author is very nearly a home boy living up there in Boone, NC.  This collection of stories is really one book about life after the big one.  It's pretty depressing when you realize that as an outsider you can see that these people live in what they call a silo but under ground, way under ground.  They've been there so long they don't know anything else.  They have some children's books depicting blue skies and green grass which are only fairy tales.<br /><br />The characters are well developed from one generation to the next.  The class system is based on the levels in which one lives.  The up tops are the sheriff, mayor and the government, the down belows are the mechanics and engineers and in the middle, running everything are the untouchable, godlike IT guys.  The only way up or down is by the metal stairway.  Trips often take two or three days and planning ahead to have someone to stay with coming and going on your journey.<br /><br />A good read which kept me up many nights until I finally finished it.  It's somewhat depressing but leaves you grateful that we have blue skies and green grass.
B004FEFS5E|2.0|Before I go over my take on the book, my biggest downer is THE KINDLE VERSION HAS LOW RESOLUTION IMAGES. As in, when you try zooming in to the full size of your screen (iPad or android tablets, or cloud reader) it's still really small, and it's difficult to judge good lighting/focus/sharpness with a low resolution image. Which is very important in a photography book, especially when he gives so many examples. To compare, take a look at the sample for [[ASIN:1118138228 Night and Low-Light Photography Photo Workshop]]. The photos in the book allow you to zoom in and see the details he can capture with the lighting, which I repeat, is very important for photography books, especially when your book is all about lighting and exposure!<br /><br />I'm not gonna cover too much in terms of what other people have said - there will be agreements and disagreements on people's opinions on how the author presents the information in his style and what not. Here's my very brief take:<br /><br />He does a good job of urging people to use manual focus. However, initially he comes off as \\"you don't need to use Av or Tv mode, just use manual\\" but if you read through it, you'll notice that he does use Av mode quite often in his photos. His justification is when the lighting is really good, your camera is smart enough to get the correct exposure with Av/Tv mode. If you want my advice, if you're not that fast or experienced with manual, then use it when you have the time to get practice, but if you're in a setting where you're constantly taking photos, such as at a birthday party or of your pets, just use what is most comfortable to you (which will probably be Av or automatic). Having photos for memories of these events is more important and you can practice elsewhere until you have the experience and skill to take full manual photos.<br /><br />I disagree strongly with his preference to slightly underexpose photos rather than overexpose (when you can't get the \\"perfect\\" exposure of course). Perhaps this is because he comes from the film age, but with digital, your digital sensor is much more sensitive and captures much more information on the \\"light\\" side, so slightly overexposing will give you much more detail and allows you to lower the exposure/lighting in post-production (e.g., by using \\"recovery\\" in lightroom).  If you try to add light in post production, you end up with a lot of noise because your sensor didn't capture the detail.

Use the Comments to air any disagreements.]<br /><br />`Secretariat' isn't among the best in the long line of movies about racetracks and horses and the people who run them. That's saying a lot, since it's got the best story of them all, at least given its protagonist, the near-miraculous Secretariat, and it's clearly among the best-funded film ever about horses and racetracks. It also has the benefit of some very solid casting, including Diane Lane, a fine actress who's a dream to watch, and John Malkovich, from the very top drawer. Despite its Disney roots, a weak script and indifferent direction hamper this movie with one-dimensional characters and low production standards.<br /><br />The weakest link is some very feeble characterizations. In one of its best scenes, the Lane character's main adversary is too easily bested by her in a public forum where their repartee comes closest to sparkling. That rival is otherwise confined to growling and shaking his fist at her from a distance, and yet he is the nearest thing in this film to a colorful secondary character of interest. No-one thought to include more of them, to lend some panache to this movie: no cigar-chomping Roscoes worrying over a racing form; no sweaty gamblers being henpecked in the stands by blowsy broads; no allowance-risking teens playing hooky for a taste of the track. Nada. A smart-alecky jockey might have added spice, as would giving the stable-boy more than just two or three lines - at least two of which he addresses to the horse!<br /><br />With such a top-flight cast even this might have been okay had the leads been put to better use. But the script is limp almost throughout, characterizing the protagonists through trite observations. The Malkovich character's inept golfing and garish outfits are subject to some ribbing - although nobody flinches when at least once he inexplicably appears in something quite stylish. Also, the dialogue between Lane and her hippie daughter too often involves heartfelt compliments about each other's good looks. Yawn.<br /><br />We're told that this daughter's youthful activism mirrors her mother's strength of spirit, but this goes no farther, hardly helping to develop either character. In another lurking subplot, or so it might seem, the protagonist lives away from her husband but with a rather masculine woman who happens to elicit some of her warmest smiles, and at least once even embraces her consolingly. But if you begin to reckon that something will emerge from this, think again: it, too, adds up to nothing (...maybe in the book?).<br /><br />Again, not much is striking in the art direction. Costumes and settings for this presumably early 1970s story are okay but don't stand out. The DVD's added features focus on how the racing was filmed from up close, deftly from a hanging camera, from the jockey's viewpoint, etc. Crafty, but nothing in this film quite conveys the exoticism of racetracks, which are elegant places where fortunes are hopefully made and lives are often broken - and this story is, precisely, about a big gamble. Interest could have been ratcheted up with a hand-held sweep through some echoing grand hall, especially of action at a racetrack's betting wickets, to show these near-mythical venues' excitement and atmosphere. But this last is what this production most lacks. In fact, like Lane's oddly frequent telephoned interactions with both husband and daughter, most of the racetrack scenes were probably filmed in a studio.Sadly, it shows.<br /><br />This may be one for the kids; just be sure they're very young. Others: keep your expectations low and you might not end up disappointed.Sadly, it shows.<br /><br />This may be one for the kids; just be sure they're very young.

Her writing style is yes a little teenage, but i don't believe it is a turn off. She does repeat her self allot, but you have to look at it from the stand point of that's just who these characters are and how they act! I am currently on the second book right now and cant seem to put it down... She leaves me wanting more. the passion between them is what really brings the books to life. You are swept in to a world where you feel that you are standing in the book itself. I'm  watching every little detail unfold first hand.

Keith Richards has an unique way of sharing his life and career. I was really surprised by how many musicians inspired him and his passion for the blues.

B00008A7QK|5.0|\\"Electric Warrior\\" from 1971, was decades ahead of its time in its blend of folk, r & b, psychedelia, rockabilly, and jazzed-up proto-punk. The writing was hip, and oh ever so groovy (I always thought Marc Bolan was closer to Donovan than to Bob Dylan), and defined the experience of the 60's generation for the glam-rockers to come. If you play the album today, it holds up and then some. All original 11 tracks are great, but some of my favorites are: \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", \\"Planet Queen\\", \\"Girl\\", \\"Life's a Gas\\", \\"The Motivator\\", \\"Jeepster\\", \\"Monolith\\", and the great closing track \\"Rip Off\\". This album must be played loud to thoroughly enjoy it! The sound quality on this new compilation is excellent. Marc Bolan and T-Rex will always remain in vogue, this is not 'dinosaur-rock'!<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero

B001V5ADS2|5.0|American culture prefers happy stories, to the point that nearly everything on network tv is about as deep as an empty suburban swimming pool. Fortunately, we have alternatives.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is the story of Walt White, former brilliant graduate student turned high school chemistry teacher.  His life is bland and unsatisfying, and Walt keeps it chugging along by hiding his many dissatisfactions under a mild facade. He says that he loves his wife, but the couple occupy distant universes.<br /><br />When Walt learns he has late stage cancer he chooses to forgo treatment. His family stages an intervention and, in a moment of rare honesty, Walt tells them that in his entire life, he has never made his own choices. The intervention ends with Walt acceding to his wife Skyler's demand that he undergo chemotherapy. Believing that he has only a couple of years to live, he sets out to give his family a financial security that they lack. Through his DEA brother in law he learns about the money to be made cooking meth. During a ride-along, he meets a former student turned meth peddler; they form a partnership in the crystal meth trade.<br /><br />The world of a meth cook, while grim and uncertain, is stripped of the petty deceits that made his previous life possible. Unable to tell his family what he's doing, he lies. And the lies slowly rip his old life apart.<br /><br />It's a painful story to watch, but an honest one. Well written and acted, as it is, it is also impossible to turn away.<br /><br />Good, honest storytelling always has something to tell us about what it means to be human in a particular time and place. And Breaking Bad is superb story telling.
0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi never disappoints. He writes very solid and entertaining stories, but with Redshirts he's letting his geek flag fly at all-time heights. Even further than he did with The Android's Dream. If you've been a fan of Sci-Fi and Star Trek: TOS in particular then you understand the idea of being a red shirt means you're probably going to die or at least be relegated to a bit player. Redshirts shows us a future where being issued a wardrobe of red is a very bad thing.<br /><br />It is true that Redshirts skewers early Trek and it does it very, very well. And it contains the best BJ joke you've probably heard all year. Yet Scalzi goes much deeper as things progress and just gets out and out strange in the last third. The story begins simply enough with new ensign level crew members coming aboard the Universal Union flagship Intrepid, which just always seems to be running low on crew. They quickly realize they are the expendable type, but something more seems to be going on then that. Improbable things keep happening and then things get meta and weird. Or is all meta weird?<br /><br />The story is not without its faults. Very little character growth occurs and some of the characters aren't very indistinguishable from others. There are many instances of some clunky bits especially in the aforementioned final third. However, this hardly ever dampened the grin the story continual caused me to sport. Either way Scalzi has written the book he's probably been dying to get to for years and the Star Trek parody I've always wanted. And while it is in a similar camp as Galaxy Quest it's setup rather differently and explores the trappings of Sci-Fi in a very unusual manner. To go into it much more would ruin things. Suffice to say if the initial hook works for you I can't help but recommend this to most Sci-Fi fans, especially those of an older generation that are looking for more than a few laughs.<br /><br />It is a much stronger showing then Fuzzy Nation, but still doesn't reach the level of detail or characterization that the Old Man's War books achieve. Redshirts is most definitely Scalzi's lightest and funniest novel to date. I give Redshirts 4 out of 5 hats. The story ends with 3 codas that are ancillary short stories closing off some loose ends brought up in the main narrative. The first was overly long and the third felt unneeded, but these parts are the more emotionally fueled sections.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I was hesitant after reading the bad reviews but I have had no problems with the application on my kindle fire and I love the game it is challenging enough for me to have fun and I'm 24 years old it is also simple enough for the children in my family to have fun hours of entertainment you wont regret paying a dollar for this application I would buy a sequel immediately
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is a game that is a thinking game and I do like it very much hence the give start rating.
B0060D10I2|5.0|Love this genre.  Burton style film is perfect for Alice in Wonderland story.  It's whimsical, bizarre a little creepy, magical and other worldly.  Just how Alice in Wonderland was meant to be portrayed.
0345803485|2.0|I had heard how exciting this book was suppose to be but was very disappointed. It was written very poorly and, although cussing doesnt bother me, it seemed that the author intentionally used the \\"f\\" word in every paragraph. The story was far from believable, as well. While it'd be a nice fantasy-come-true scenerio, things moved way too fast to get involved. It does hold your attention but only because you're waiting for something to actually happen for the main character, Ana. Once near the end, it just ends. Left me thinking, \\"what!?\\" ....I wouldnt recommend it and will not be buying the others.
0340980508|5.0|My husband just had a stroke, and this book has been very helpful.  Quite a few things that I didn't know.  The book arrived promptly, and I sure needed and used most of the suggestions.  Very informative.  Thank you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a fun and addicting game!  Very comparable to the first Mario brothers game.  My kids pick this over some of the blood and guts games.  That alone makes it worth it.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|it freezes after 5 seconds of playing. I'm using a kindle fire and it shuts down whenever I play. so basicly it sucks
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I listen to howard stern daily and transfer the show to my SD card. This app makes life so much easier so I dont have to get the transfer cord out everytime.... Just click on this and transfer! Works great.. 5 stars!!!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is one of my favorite games! The only bad thing is that it freezes my Kindle a lot and my Kindle has to die before I can do anything. If the game didn't freeze I would have given it 5 stars.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|omg this app is soo much fun i havent stoped editing my pictures since i got it this app is great for adults and kids no matter how old you are all types of effect here to play and arrange them in ...must have app
B004Q3NBXU|5.0|Only one word should be used to describe this film.... Awesome...<br />this movie is a harkening back to the old school revenge action guy flicks that bring to mind Bruce Lee, Charles Bronson, Yule Brenner, Chuck Norris, Sly and Arnold. Just plain good ole shoot'em up, car chase, butt whooping that we all love. If you liked Expendables, any of the older 60's, 70's, or 80's action movies WATCH THIS!! You will not be disappointed.
B0079J26XO|4.0|For me the real reason to buy this is a bit of disappointment.  I had such high hopes.  I adore Du Pre/Barbirolli's version of the Elgar Cello concerto.  One of my top 100.  For me, it a love song to the decline and fall of the British Empire:  grand, mournful, heartfelt, tragic and beautiful.  There are many versions of this performance out there, some for dirt cheap.  So in this new outting, new re-master at 16 bucks a pop, get it.<br /><br />It still has the bad cloistered EMI sound.  No miracle here.  (EMI please fly over the engineers of EMI Japan's Klemperer Brahms Requiem.)  It has opened up some but not really in way I would like.  You don't get a real sense of space, orchestra and soloist in a space with pinpoint accuracy.  It is still and orchestra with the violin not the violins, cellos, making a a more dynamic whole which I am sure was there in the performance.  But the remastering is better.  I don't know why, though, I don't have the same sense of thrill in this version.  Perhaps I've listened to it too much and need to give it a breather.  (As a side note: Avoid the EMI XRCD version that is going around.  It is supposed to be from Japan but seems to be a Chinese fake.  Complete waste of money.)<br /><br />Janet Baker's Sea Pictures does sound much better.  I don't love the piece but I respect people who do love it.  So, if that is the reason why you are looking at this review, yes, go ahead, you will be pleased.<br /><br />The Delius?  Usually people love or hate Delius.  Not me.  I like, dislike or am indifferent, depending upon the performance, sound and, I guess, my mood.  Traditionally bad EMI sound again.  I don't have the regular version of this to compare it to.  Now when putting it in my player, I skip over it.<br /><br />The Delius Cello Concerto:  I can't remember hearing it before -although I have it in the complete Du Pre EMI set.  It sounds like Ravel as an Englishman - sentimental, pudgy with ale and pale without lovely French precisionand contempt.  An affable piece, you can spend an afternoon with picnicing.  The recording sounds good.  Du Pre's playing and tone are grand.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I bought it for about 19 with shipping and I am keeping it.  I'm just not dancing about it.<br /><br />If anyone has heard EMI Japan's versions, please comment.
B004U52VPS|3.0|My kids (12 year old,3 year old) loved it for all of 15 minutes. After the 15 minutes it was shoved back in the box and stuffed in the closet. But for the 15 minutes they did play with it i admit they were laughing there butts off!! I myself was not a fan of the product because the birds and blocks that you played with were always flying everywere. So if you like picking up tiny toys everywere then get this, if not.............
0345803485|5.0|Just go with it...It is a good book and it will get you thinking. Have an open mind and relax!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was a fast, fun read for me. This is one of those books that is even more fun to read if you see the movie first; that way, you can picture the scenes and characters in your mind as you go. The book is different in many respects than the movie; however, I still say it is best to see the movie, then read the book, or just read the book. I do not recommend reading the book, then seeing the movie. See the movie first.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  It is super handy to have the Bible with me when I'm on the run, and I love the different reading plans available!  :)
B0041TM5OU|5.0|This album is one of the most important pieces of recorded music, period.  What's more, it is eminently listenable on many levels.  It doesn't matter if you like Louis Armstrong, Justin Bieber, Mozart, the Grateful Dead, or Slayer for that matter -- you will love it and then some.<br /><br />Nothing needs to be added.  Nothing needs to be taken away.  The music just hangs there in the air around you as a sublime ethereal thing.  Austerity and lushness in an extraordinary dance.<br /><br />Additionally, this particular remaster does a fine job of bringing life to these incredible performances.  The soundstage is just right, and the levels are spot on.  All good, and then some!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This continuation is good. Definitely holds the readers' attention. It fills out the Katniss-Peeta relationship. It is not as gripping as \\"Hunger Games\\" was, but a very good read.B.
B00029D04M|4.0|This kit is a very well laid out kit.  It doesnt have a lot of pieces, but the fittment is really good.  The model detail is very high for something of this scale.  There is however a lot of flashing that needs to be trimmed on some of the parts.  The decal selection for this model is top notch, they are difficult to put on, but if done well this model can look really great.

0374203032|5.0|Here is nice little book by Michael Sandel, who I first heard about on the Colbert Report. His main question is what he ends the book with, \\"Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?\\" He is speaking about our society and what type of one do we want to live in. It is a book which begs the question of how do markets reflect our morality and in what ways do they shape it. I really enjoyed the way Sandel writes this book with many case studies and arguments on both sides. While you can definitely see they way in which he thinks toward each situation, it seems he presents it more with the notion that these issues are something we need to realize and think critically about before they in turn shape who we become. Mainly using his two fold rubric of fairness and corruption, he assesses different situations to determine their moral judgement and how that relates to a market judgement. I think this raises some great questions to utilitarianism and different ways we make decisions. He is tying morality into everything we do, especially in the free market world, where not even here are you free from moral decisions. Rather we need to have these moral and civic discussions. Markets should not take a \\"nonjudgmental stance toward values.\\" This is my overall impression and short summary, below I will give a chapter by chapter breakdown if you are interested.<br /><br />Jumping the Queue<br /><br />Here Sandel brings up the line cutting issue of whether there are certain things we should all have to wait for, or can money buy a fast track. This includes jumping lines at airports, solo carpool drivers, ticket scalping, concierge doctors, and the new line standing business. Are there certain things that all should wait their turn for, or does the childhood rule \\"don't cut in line\\" not apply to us so grown up? He also speaks to some of the other ways we allocate things as merit, need, and others.<br /><br />Incentives<br /><br />Incentives are the name of the game of economics. I am not really a student of economics though I do know my way around moral and ethical issues, and this was perhaps my favorite chapter. He raises some tough questions and starts the chapter off with one of the toughest, asking whether drug addicted women should be offered incentives to become sterile. I still don't really know where I stand but here was brought up some great discussion. Being in education I agree with his assessment of corruption coming with paying students for reading or getting good grades, but I also see parallels in this and certain academic scholarships for students who have done well in high school and continue to do well in college. So incentives still play a part for secondary and above education, but perhaps in a little different vein than the direct cash incentives of his case studies.  I think his statement here best sums up the chapter, \\"In general, cash incentives seem to work better at getting people to show up for a specific event-a doctor's appointment or an injection-than at changing long-term habits and behaviors\\".<br /><br />How Markets Crowd Out Morals<br /><br />Actually this was my favorite chapter. What can money buy? Friends, Nobel Prizes, Academy Awards... These are a few examples of things Sandel says we all agree money can't buy. Though any more I would say the way you use your money could buy you many \\"Friends\\". Perhaps not in the true sense of the word, but definitely in some ways in which we use the word. \\"Economists hate gift giving\\" I was interested about this topic and discussed it with my wife on which she would rather have. I remember how when I was a child getting money was lame, but now at times I would much rather have money than a gift, perhaps I have become corrupted toward the social free market system. I was very surprised by how market incentives tainted civic/national duty. It was a wonderful example of market corruption, but my favorite part is his discussion of the crowding out of non market norms, and the commercialization effect. The rubs comes to intrinsic motivations and external ones, and \\"when people are engaged n an activity they consider intrinsically worthwhile, offering them money may weaken their motivation\\" which goes against the fundamental economic theory. At one of the most interesting parts of the book he describes Arrow's two tenants of the market, both of which are very interesting but the second is the one most intriguing. \\"Ethical behavior is a commodity that needs to be economized\\" or that \\"Markets, which rely on self-interest, spare us from using up the limited supply of virtue\\". Sandel and I both agree that this is a complete falsehood. He goes into some wonderful discussions on love and altruism, but I see that this economizing of virtues distorts the very meaning of the words and \\"corrupts\\" them as Sandel might say.<br /><br />Markets in Life and Death<br /><br />This chapter discusses some of the moral issues within insurance and the difference between it and death bets. Much of this I didn't know about. I think it shows my own fallenness that as I am reading some of this and thinking how horrible it is, I am also thinking, \\"I wonder if I can make any money here\\".<br /><br />Naming Rights<br /><br />His last chapter mainly discussed advertising and where it should and should not be. While the arguments towards it were slightly on the fairness angle, most dealt with the corruption factor and degradation of the items, places, cars, or school that implemented the advertising. Woven within this chapter is also a theme he has sparsely throughout the book and that is the growing distance between the wealthy and the poor. One thing I think he notices and talks about which I very much admired is that the issue is not so much that certain people now have more money than others do, whether or not that is truer now of today than the past, but rather that the wealthy seems to live in a different world than the rest of us do. At the end of the chapter he calls it skyboxification. Where \\"the more things that money can buy, the fewer the occasions when people from different walks of life encounter one another\\". Perhaps we wouldn't really care to much if others had more money than us if they didn't or couldn't use it to separate themselves into their own world. Shouldn't we all be in this thing called life together anyway? I think this is a great aspect and personally I think it is one where the church can speak volumes. In the church community it shouldn't matter if you have money or not, we are all on the same level before God and all need each other in this \\"common life\\".
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Overall: Basically, in a nutshell, this app allows you to connect and download from/upload to your tablet without a cord. It also allows you to delete files, change file names, simply everything you can do when you hook it up to the computer. Really useful if you, well, don't want to connect your tablet to the PC physically. Honestly though, this can be handy if say, you want to keep using your tablet while uploading a large file to it from the computer. The way the app works is that you open the app and then access the tablet file system through your web browser on your computer using an address that the app provides. Pretty simple, even for the technologically challenged. And the whole thing happens through your WiFi network. I was a little concerned about having difficulties at work; However, I was successful during my first attempt with zero troubleshooting. Very nice!<br /><br />Pros: First of all, I have used a couple others of these so called `USB Thumb Drive' apps and this one is definitely the best. It works well every time, over pretty much any network. This app is extremely useful because my tablet's physical connection basically prevents any use of the tablet when hooked up via USB. The app keeps running in the background, so all you have to do is set up an operation (upload/download) and then you keep using the tablet as normal. A password can be set up to access the webapp, which is a very nice feature.<br /><br />Cons: Webapp interface is slightly slow and will keep you waiting almost as if you were using dial up (not good if you are impatient). Visually speaking, the web interface is not as pretty as some of this app's competitors. Uploading is performed using a very antiquated system in my opinion. It seems that in this world of HTML 5 and Java powered upload tools, one could be added.<br /><br />Most Useful Feature: Downloading from the device is dead simple. In fact, it is the only action that requires a single mouse click from your browser. Simply locate the file you want, click it and it begins downloading to your computer immediately.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game remind me of the old super Mario brothers on nintendo; which was cool! its also nice that it was free
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty good tam takes a long time to do some of the goals. but over all pretty fun. I play It once in a while not something childern would be interested in tho.

B00785P2QC|5.0|It for sure keeps you on your toes. I love games like this. I have it on my phone and now Kindle Fire.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|In spite of inexplicable mass critical hatred, John Carter is a rollicking good time with some great action set pieces, and a significant amount of well-placed humor. Taylor Kitsch seems a bit young for the title role, but plays a credible John Carter with some excellent comedic timing of his own. If you missed it in theaters, this movie is definitely worth checking out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Do yourself and favor, stop reading the reviews and buy this fantastic piece of science fiction right now.  With Wool, Howey has created an incredibly compelling post-apocalyptic environment.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|hello this game is so much fun and u should get it right now with no regrets and its amazingly entertains
B007N0REX6|5.0|'Apocalyptic Love' is credited as Slash's second solo album, but in truth, it's more like like the debut album of his new band. After a number of talented-but-unstable frontmen, Slash finally seems to have found his perfect musical partner in Myles Kennedy. The tight and propulsive rhythm section of Todd Kerns and Brent Fitz is a force to be reckoned with as well, rounding out \\"The Conspirators\\". The results of this collaboration is a thoroughly enjoyable hard rock record that marks some of the best work of all the players involved.<br /><br />It may have taken decades in the business and several different bands along the way before finding each other, but Myles and Slash both compliment and push each other in mutually beneficial and interesting ways. Though his work in Alter Bridge is stellar, that band plays more to Kennedy's heavier, more metal sensibilities; with Slash, Kennedy gets to show off his looser, bluesier, rock 'n' roll side. Myles' voice is, quite simply, a thing of beauty, and the man is capable of singing just about anything. His assortment of high-pitched wails, soulful crooning, and lower-register vocals are the perfect compliment to Slash's playing, which, as usual, is phenomenal and instantly recognizable.<br /><br />The album is a straight-up blast of hard rock, the kind Slash lives to play: melodic, riff-heavy, and with an abundance of his trademark solos. The joy behind the album is pretty apparent in every track, as well it should be; for the first time in years, perhaps ever, Slash is playing in a band that doesn't seem on the verge of imploding at any given moment. Amazingly, none of the album's 13 tracks (15 in the Deluxe Edition) feel like filler, for each of them carry their own groove and energy. Particular standouts include the title track, Standing in the Sun, You're a Lie, No More Heroes, Anastasia, and Far and Away, though in all honesty, these selections are merely personal preference. As others have mentioned, virtually any one of the tracks could be a viable candidate for a single. The album really is that good.<br /><br />Most of the few negative reviews of this album seem to criticize it for what that particular reviewer wished it was, rather than what it actually is. Those who complain that Slash isn't \\"pushing his boundaries\\" or \\"experimenting\\" with his music are not only completely missing the point, they probably aren't very big fans of Slash in the first place. With 'Apocalyptic Love,' Slash has delivered precisely the type of album he loves to make: exciting, high volume, straight-up hard rock. With Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators, he has found the perfect band to realize his vision, and the results are not to be missed. Every member of the band has reason to be supremely proud of this record, and any fans of Slash, Myles Kennedy, or rock 'n' roll in general simply must check it out.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is great! the action is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone!!! so hurry up and get it.
B005VT42BS|2.0|Don't understand this app. Maybe those with better brains could figure this out...why does one need to know what other services are in the area when you can only use one at a time anyway???
0345803507|5.0|I loved this whole series!  Would recommend to adults only!  Keep out of the hands of the teenagers!  Very steamy :)
B007MJKOY4|1.0|Not as great as I thought it would be.  Very slow throughout much of the movie.  There were some scenes that didn't seem to add much value to the storyline.  The story seemed to rely on the tension created by what was not said between the characters.  I just didn't find it entertaining and sadly must add it to one of the few movies I didn't finish watching.
B00004ST9Q|1.0|I was very disappointed by how they messed the songs up. I expected classics and got techno. The songs did not need any editing to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|from the moment i picked up this book it took me a week to read all three of her books. i have never been so into a book before fell in love with ann and christian at once  and i must say the romance was beyond anything i have ever read in any book i have everyone at my job reading these books if your looking for a good read fifty shades of gray is the book
0345803507|5.0|I so LOVED this trilogy! Neither one of the previous two books were a disappointment and neither was this one.<br />I paced myself with this third book because having flew through the first two, I did NOT want it to end!<br />I have NEVER done that before with any book.<br />My friends hounded me to finish sooner so they could read it next!<br />I actually MADE myself only read a chapter or two a day for a couple of days but<br />then I couldn't take it any longer and flew through the rest of the book.<br />These books just got better and better. So well written. I found all the characters so real and believable.<br />I have a Kindle but bought the soft covers so I could share with my friends who don't have one. I'm so glad I did.<br />They love me for it and are so not disappointed with the books either.<br />Very often I sell my books when I'm done but these are not going anywhere!<br />E.L.James,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE write more!!!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The watch I received had a metal band instead of a canvas band. Bought for my son's birthday and had to return and order a different watch. Now my son's birthday present will be late. Grrr!
0345803493|5.0|I LOVED this trilogy! I am so glad I bought the 3 books together.<br />I was able to finish the first one,(in record time I must admit)and start the next one.<br />Each book gets better and better.<br />So good! I have a waiting list of friends who couldn't wait to get the next one!
0345803493|3.0|I almost felt like this book was written by another author, maybe a romance author. I'm not saying the first one was well written, but there was an edginess about it that is completely gone in book two. How the title says 50 Shades Darker is beyond me, it's 100 Shades lighter. Christian is now a people pleasing wimp and any sort of backbone Ana displayed is gone too. I don't even want to read book three, I suspect they'll marry and live happily ever after.<br />The special thing about these books is that they went where very few books written for women would have the nerve to go and I feel like the author just sort of game up trying to be new and different and just romanticized the characters and I think they and the readers deserved better.
B007X16GFC|5.0|Amazon has a wealth of online content and I love being able to rent online and stream instantly. The movie experience was great and I would rent again in this way. As for the movie itself. It was good. If you are a fan of Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark without the funky bunch) then you'll like this movie. Kate Beckensale does a great job as well and despite her affinity for using the F-word (which sounds so sweet coming from her british lips) is adorable in this movie. Its an action movie with some drama - what's more to say? It didn't suck and I thought it was worth the watch.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you enjoy puzzle games, this us for you! It comes with a ton of content for lots of play time.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Would have loved to had all 4 in one pack, but for the price, It was Mission Impossible to pass up. Three Mission Impossible movies come economically packed and ready for action. Not a lot of extras, but it was just what I was expecting and I would endorse it again and again!
B00006LFGD|4.0|Very relaxing. especially in the car. If you are a Barbra fan you will love this. She is timeless. I hope she does another Duets 2
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Rented on Amazon and streamed it to the TV. Awesome. I love being able to rent a movie from Amazon and watch it instantly. The HD quality was superb (helps to have plenty of bandwidth) and the movie was a blast to watch (literally). Great action sequel to the MI series and worth checking out!
B000ICXQII|2.0|I didn't like it. I suppose if you are sado-masochistic by nature, you might enjoy it. The plot was too broken, and I was disappointed with Howard Shore's music. His modern movie scores are much better. I just kept saying \\"Yuk!\\" and then laughing where it wasn't supposed to be funny. Sorry, but this film was just b.a.d. in my opinion.
B007HJ84WS|5.0|My first rental from Amazon and streamed to the set! Love being able to rent movies this way. With plenty of bandwidth this movie was a phenomenal experience. Watched it in HD. The movie itself was good action with great visuals and special effects. Was it epic? Yeah...it was epic! Have fun it is worth checking out.
B007MAETA8|5.0|At the first chord of Queen of California, a smile crossed my face. And that was it. It was instant. Yes, I could hear other songs inspirations in it (Allman Bros 'Midnight Rider' came to mind; even James Taylor). I had just bought the album on a sunny afternoon, and headed to the ocean for lunch all by my lonesome. In this time of money troubles, uncertainty and change, I needed something for this spring, something that had to be just right for the oncoming summer in which I was going to be doing a lot of traveling myself on the road with close friends I've known since high school, one abroad for a wedding and others for fun. What I knew about Born and Raised was that it was going to be different. And at a time for me when friends had hinted at moving away, leaving my small town in New England (only an hour from fairfield; John's home) I felt this album was made just for my own personal growth as well as Mr. Mayer's, which after 10 straight listens while on night shift all by myself in an empty mill in Connecticut, has shaped itself to be. It is perfect. The tracks are all masterfully crafted and are separate in artistry and detail in their own key ways; every one of them has its own soul. I think these songs are just letting John sit in and sing for them rather him and his band being the ones who created them. They needed to come out this way and they did. At a time where just in the last year I have gotten into more albums by Terry Reid and other folk artists...this one is a welcome sigh of relief for me as a fan of John since Inside Wants Out. Whereas we are in a time where bands like TRAIN would rather do tween pop dance tunes rather than get back to their roots and deliver some good old fashioned road songs (which is what I wanted from Train's new album California 37 which was sadly not good) to prove their growth and maturity, John Mayer has miraculously rescued our summer. Even after you get into the album there's a sense of leaving home, escaping (Walt Grace) appeals to me very much in that way and is one of the best tracks in this collection. Olivia and a Face to Call Home conclude the album exactly the way it should: Neat and tidy with a hint that John is still out there on his own road...but it has yet to end...and that's damn pleasing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found the theme of the book quite revealing, as not an area I've read about.  I truly got caught up in the relationship---at first.  I finished the first book, got the second, thinking something new might be explored to keep the interest.  Not to be.  I read it, but began to skip the sexual encounters as they were so often and rather boring. But, because I had to know if their relationship survived the turmoil, I bought the third book.  Pretty much the same as one and two.  The last part of book three captured my interest once again and I dearly loved the ending.  I felt the author had a \\"sexual encounter\\" data base, and when he went blank, he just drew from that resource.  Bottom line is this:  A trilogy it should never have been.  If you combined all three books, leave out the \\"filler\\", it would have been one excellent book.  Just an additional note:  Who could possibly play the part of Christian.  Is anyone truly that gorgeous?
B007N0REX6|5.0|This is a kick arse album his best work yet guitar wise killer solos all the way through and a great mix of songs \nn/
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I needed to know what all the hype was about and read the book. It was terrible. The only thing I can compare it to is it Twilight for adults. It is about a girl's thoughts as she becomes so enamored with a guy's looks that she is willing to play into his sex preferences. She doesn't really seem to care about him as a person and it is written as if it was written by a sex crazed 7th grader. Not really knowing what they are doing. This is definitely not winning the nobel prize. It is easy to read, but has terrible character development. I wish I never bought it.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I bought this dvd for my husband's birthday as this is his all time favorite movie and we were having difficulty finding it. I located it on Amazon.com and the seller's description was everything they said it would be. It came as a 2-disc anniversary version, BRAND NEW, NEVER OPENED, and ALL THE FACTORY SEALS. The dvd set even came before the date the seller said it would. My husband absolutely flipped when he opened the packaged and saw this dvd and I want to thank you for making his b'day extra special without any problems. I would HIGHLY recommend using this seller, mjcafass again. GREAT JOB!!!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I like this app. Took me a bit to figure it out but it is exactly what I needed. I was not looking for a calendar to sync with any other calendar so maybe that's why it easily fit my needs. That is not to say it wouldn't sync, it did. I just didn't need that. I like being able to select the colors I want to use in the display.
0345803493|3.0|Where the first book in the series was self-indulgently entertaining to read, this book kind of kicked it down a few notches. Oh sure, there's some eye rollingly bad scenes of the sexual and non-sexual kind, but ultimately this book just didn't deliver on the promise of Fifty Shades of Grey. All I can ultimately assume is that James just got a little bored while writing this one.<br /><br />I do have to give credit where credit is due- James's writing style did improve in this book, although if she didn't grow even slightly as an author by this point then I'd have been surprised. Most should improve with practice, after all. The downside of this is that the Ed Wood badness of her previous writing style is what really made the first book such fun to read. There are some sweet scenes here and there, but in the end the best parts of the book were the minor characters, most specifically Christian's exes to varying extents. (Although one of them is portrayed in such a way that didn't really match up with later and more extreme actions.)<br /><br />There's less sexual content in this entry, which I also think hurt the book. James comes alive when she's writing bad sex scenes and trying to shock. The general idea of the second book: the revealing of Grey's past and the progression of his relationship with Ana is interesting in theory, but I don't think it required 532 pages to tell. If this had been about 100-150 pages shorter, the story would have been much improved because the later half of the novel just dragged on. This is despite several revelations that are supposed to be gasp-worthy.<br /><br />I liked the book well enough to warrant wanting to read the final book, but if the first book had been this dull I probably wouldn't have bothered with the next one in the series. It was just a disappointing read overall. My score is 2.5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I'll round it up to a 3.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|ok so I admit it is fun but the sound I mean who speaks Chinese or Japanese???whatever they speak I do not understand!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This is a cool movie. Like most of Tom's recent movies he runs around a lot. If you don't mind watching Tom Cruise running it is a good movie. Lots of action and well worth the watch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very funn! can waste lots of time.....fun games...great 4 kids ...never ending fun of games ..download it u wont regret it!  :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game, the only thing is I ain't got no more cash, and most of the things cost cash. but other then that it's great. oh and if your energy run's out, leave the game for awhile and then come Back and your energy will be filled up!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very addicting games. worth hours of fun. and stays interesting with the various games. absolutely loved it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I bought the first fifty shades of gray.  I was so disapointed with the content.  Where is the theme, hard to find with the sexual scenes.  Really, what women wants to be whipped, dominated and controlled.  Why is this book such a hit?  I actually paid for this slime.  I had it deleted from my account.  Would not buy it, unless, you are looking for a novel of male dominion and female humilation.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its an awesome game because you can play it online. I also like it because you have to pay.  a little bit I don't want to pay.
0345803485|5.0|All three books where AMAZING! i couldnt get enough. ( i want more, cant wait for the movie. ) i just could not put the books down. I was so heartbroken when i was done with all three, i was going crazy. I love to read books like this. People may say they didnt like the book. most likely they didnt like it because they didnt give it a chance. or possibly there just not into the things Christian Grey did or whatever the reason being. Honestly the book was one of my favorite books to read. Hands down. It was so easy to visual everything. I would have dreams every night from this book. most parts of the book would make my stomach have butterflies because it felt so real. But everybody has there own opinion. Its a number one seller in new york.  To bad there is no christian grey out there :) read the book. dont listen to the negative reviews they just didnt read it correctly.
0738711500|5.0|With this beautiful deck and book I really AM learning to read the Tarot.  The cards are inspired, the book is easy to find your cards in and the interpretations are practical.  As for the not-so-easy-to-quantify, I find more often than not I'm stunned by the truth the cards reveal.  You'll find this set is more than just fun.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|It's FRIENDS - where have you been...? If you don't know this show, then you probably need to get this set.
0439023521|4.0|I am not a young adult reader, but a much older reader.  Certainly the premise of this book would never come to be (hopefully), but the story is well told along with the character's personalities.  Perhaps one day I may read the other 2 in the series to see how Ms. Collins works this all out.  But with this book, sadly, it is fairly easy to forecast the ending for anyone mature enough to \\"get\\" the story line.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Great product, simple design, easy to use, very efficient, excellent price. The locking feature is great and easy to use for long exposures, and and works just as good as the regular button.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this application. I play it several times a day. It has easily become one of my best games.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's a great pass time. The graphics are awesome, and I love the movie too. It is just so perfect.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. The best Spider app I have find for the kindle fire. Helps me pass time when I'm relaxing. Easy to play and fun too. I highly recommend this application for downloading.
