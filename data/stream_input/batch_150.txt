B0077FJWFK|5|great buy
B00547IVXM|5|I ordered this particular \\"Find My Key\\" remote because it had overwhelmingly good reviews.  I was surprised to get a personal unsolicited friendly email from the seller thanking me for purchasing the product and assuring me that she would immediately remedy any problem that may arise.  She even gave me her phone number!!<br />I've never received a friendly message like that from any seller anywhere-even after I've contacted them!!<br /><br />I emailed her that I was having a problem with the receiver beeping at inappropriate times and miles from home.<br />She wrote back immediately suggesting that the battery might be loose (it was ) and suggesting I reinstall it and make sure it's secure. At the same time she said she was going to send me a replacement and xtra batteries either way!<br /><br />I reinstalled the battery--made sure it was snapped in well...and the PROBLEM DISAPPEARED. NOW IT WORKS PERFECTLY!<br /><br />This is a very well-meaning and kind seller.<br /> I trust that anything I buy from this seller has a reasonable guarantee that comes with it.  I'D BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER.<br /><br />(I\\"ve had bad experiences with other sellers who did not stand behind their products. When an expensive item broke after 7 days, I was told I was out of luck!  Even tho I'd had the product less than two weeks. This wasn't on Amazon however.)<br /><br /> So nice to have a HUMAN BEING at the other end of the transaction!!
B000C9S4RU|5|I have an 04 Silverado in which I bought used a couple of years ago.  The DRLs never worked and I just decided to get down to the bottom of it.  First I checked the fuse box; the DRL 10 amp fuse was blown and I replaced it.  I also put new bulbs in and that didn't work either.  So I replaced the brown/blackened sockets with these LS94 sockets and I finally have DRLs!  This is an easy DIY project.  I also added a little dielectric grease in the new sockets just for good measure.
B000G27HBW|5|We have been using this product for the last several years on our Fifth Wheel, which is our home.  I usually apply it every 6 months, although it could wait a year.  You just literally spray wipe it on and then use microfiber cloth after to give it a little shine.  Very easy to apply and no hard rubbing needed.  Love this product
B001GF7MT0|5|Love it! I don't know if it cools down as drastic as the advertisement says but I can tell there is a difference inside the vehicle. Plus, anyone who's noticed has complimented on how attractive it looks in the windshield. I always have my truck clean inside and don't like any loose objects in the cab so it can be a little annoying with it being solid but I knew that getting into this investment.
B002YFAUQS|5|Amazing, i definitely look forward to purchasing more products from you I was not disappointed thank you. It was in good condition and looks good on my car.
B00BZFZHCK|4|Although it did fit on the front, I could not place the rear bar over the slot on the rear rail as the rail was about 1/2 inch wider than the ar attachment.  It is installed, but about 6 inches short of the intended opening for a rear bar.
B000IXTGHW|1|This product is aweful. it blows fuses constantly and when you can get it to run it puts out no heat at all, it just smells as though something is burning.
B001V8U12M|5|Just what we needed.
B000B68V6I|4|Same stuff you can get almost anywhere, but the dispenser is handy for measuring the amount you are going to put into your gas tank. I like it.
B0002U1TXK|4|Worked fine. I need to use it again.
B006RLBZPU|5|Delivered on time and installed perfectly.
B002E5BVZC|5|Works as described.  Super easy to install.  Why pay more?
B008G23K4C|5|Tried one of those polishing kits for $20.00 and was not satisfied with the results. Paid an additional $21.95 for replacement bulbs. Purchased both COMPLETE headlights for $77.00 and installed in less than an hour. Bulbs were included and they fit like factory originals. Very happy with the product. Now I will no longer waste time and money with polishing kits.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Couldn't believe how much smaller and lighter it is than the one I'm replacing. Took about 1/2 hour to charge on a 10 amp charger. Cranks my Ducati over better than the original battery. I've had excellent service with LiPo batteries. Amazon's price can't be beat either.
B000GZOEF6|5|This is a beefy, protective skid plate for your XR.  I have already taken a couple of hits on it in Moab and it easily withstood the abuse.  It shows scratches in its perfect brushed surface when impacted, but that is what it is there for.  It is far better than mashing up the frame/motor.<br /><br />It is a bit of a tricky install and may wish you had 3 or 4 tiny elf hands instead of the 2 you will be using to get the clips all in place while tightening them.  Other than fitting your hands and clips in tight spaces, it is a fairly simple, straightforward install.  It should only take 45 minutes or so to remove factory crash guard and install the new MSR skid plate (assuming you have the tools/torx to tighten the clips).
B009HSP3K8|5|Easy to install with good instructions.
B000BUU5TU|2|I have a problem with the black water tank not emptying completely. I thought this would help.  The holes are so small they may rinse the upper portions of the tank but the flow is so low it will not move any solids.  I drilled a 1/4 inch hole in the end and that helped.  If you have the water pressure and the time to wait, it may work for you.
B00M499XZS|5|bad a$@$@ plates  awesome!!!!
B0049AYG2K|5|Good fit for my prius and part   arrive on time
B007OC9JGI|5|I use this motor oil in my 2000 Trans am and it works great.  The price on amazon is the best.
B000GKB0FI|5|My friend loved this! It was an Awesome gift!
B001O0XKR0|2|Brake pads were easily installed on a Toyota Sienna that had 60,000 miles on original Toyota pads with life remaining.<br />After install, a noticeable improvement in braking action was observed. First several months on new pads, no noise what so<br />ever.  After 2-3 months of usage, a very annoying brake squeal developed. Removal and reinstall of pads has been done 2 more<br />times including cleaning of rotors which provides a temporary period of no noise but then return of highly intermittent brake<br />squeal. I might drive 100 miles in combined urban/rural driving with no brake noise, -then next day hear brake squeal sometimes<br />and other times quiet braking. Possibly temperature related, cool brakes-squeal, warm brakes-no squeal; hard to predict???<br />Toyota pads were always quiet.  I am considering using the Wagner ThermoQuiet pads as paper or fishing weights and installing<br />the Toyota disc pads.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would not purchase Wagner QC906A pads again.
B009ES3F0Q|5|These lights are bright and clear, producing a nice \\"white\\" light.  The metal casing is a nice plus - not something you'll probably find in any light at this price.  The casing is hefty with cooling fins on the back.<br /><br />I bought these to put on my FJZ80 Land Cruiser.  They are not very deep (good) which allowed me to mount them on the top of the bumper in front of the grille.  They do not touch the grille and they do not protrude past the front of the bumper - Perfect!<br /><br />Definitely recommend them.
B000P50FRS|5|It is perfect!  It was easy to put on and take off.  Folds into its own bag, and covered her up for the last snow storm!! I only wish I had gotten it years ago!!
B000VKTUD2|5|BAM! Great price, and delivered as promised!
B00JLJWGTE|5|I have these in my vw bug convertible.  The are nice looking, stick to the carpet great, and vacuum easily.  The design is just fun and I can't wait till summer to put eh top down and show them off.
B000K36BCI|1|Extremely low quality.  1 day after use the plastic lost its tension, the foam doesn't hold shape so the glasses aren't held securely.  Low low quality.  I'm in the market for a replacement.
B0009FBZ50|5|I bought this for a newly acquired 2006 MINI Cooper S and it fits _perfectly_ behind the seats.  Exactly the right depth and about two thirds of the width of the boot.  It should be a great carpet protector.
B007R6JSOY|5|Great product.
B000182DW4|3|easy install, less than 5 minutes...again mfg. would not honor rebate request sent in time + required proof of purchase, Amazon order # and copy of order/invoice... like this product just don't appreciate bait and switch promo.
B0081OSRQQ|3|Very small amount of product, their are better clay bars out there...works ok on small areas but if you plan to do a large area don't get this one.
B000CMD29W|5|these air bags  fit like a glove  and do the job just like they should  was easy to install too
B00236XLA0|5|Simple enough but that's all I was looking for so it was a great puchase. It provides a nice simple base for your license plate.
B0060WP912|1|Doesn't fit right for a '98 Lexus GS 400. Prevents the armrest lock from making contact with the bottom latch, so I have to pull it back to close it. It's too \\"fluffy\\" and too big.  I used it for a day and sent it back. Avoid.
B004RDNPOY|5|Excellent. Easy to install. Works the same as original.
B0006JO0TC|5|I have long dreaded hearing those words coming from my Wife's lips.  Now, with this solar battery charger attached to the battery of her lawn tractor, I no longer have to find the battery charger, run out an extension cord to her gardening shed, hookup and wait for the battery to come back to life.  As Martha would say \\"it's a good thing\\".
B004P20GIA|5|Easy to install and operate.  I put it on and left the next day for a trip that took me 2k+ miles, and no issue with this cover.  All of my stuff was dry after going through a couple rain storms.  There will probably be some permanent depressions in the stock plastic edge cover from the clamps, but I don't plan on &#34;not&#34; having a cover, so not an issue.  I did have an issue with the release rubbing the bed rail, but that was corrected by moving the clamp a little further away (probably to the recommended 6 inches) and lightly sanding the bottom of the lever.  I am interested to see how well the release lever holds up over time.
B0053Y7RHC|5|Exactly what I needed and at a price that couldn't be beat. The price I paid for both jacks is normally the price of one. My only gripe is they came beat up. Not sure if it was from shipping or something else. Still at the price a little black spray paint fixed them right up.
B0041CE4PU|5|I went through three other saddlebag before purchasing these, and didn't realize the difference in quality until I compared them.  These bags are well made and study, the locks are durable, the bags handle the wind (staying closed and secure at 100+ mph), the cushion backing provides great support without any damage/scratches against the brackets and/or fender.  I would definitely recommend these Saddlebags and the River Road brand.
B0080E7ORA|5|Very pleased with this OEM-styly filter, especially because it came with all the necessary o-rings and gaskets. Made installation a snap.
B000E2CVI8|4|Works as should.<br />Wont result in performance gains.
B000F64S84|3|I carry the shovel in my  car incase I get out of my parking spot.  It works good.
B00AGN68QQ|5|nice item
B00NYXDCZK|5|One of my buddies at work owns a motorcycle, snowmobile, boat, two cars and a Suburban, so I got this for review from the vendor and let an expert test it out.  He loves the thing.<br /><br />The fabric is lightweight but durable and we've had enough rain lately to give it a good try out.<br /><br />The feature he particularly loves though is the ease with which it goes on and off, thanks to a clever mounting system where you attack one end in your trunk and that holds it fast while you pull the rest over the car to the hood.  He says it's the easiest car cover to use that he's ever owned.
B000Q05GTY|5|Great belt. Didn't slip when it got wet.
B00CZRV57S|5|Seat covers that fit and look great.  They installed easily and the material fit like the original.  My wife love the covers.  I was hoping amazon would offer the back seat covers also.
B003T0Z4KE|5|this item meets all my requirements
B0001EXKOI|1|They are liar. Before I bought it, it said it fit my car (2001 Nissan Quest).  I wanted to put it on yesterday and it didn't fit. I was going to complain but they changed the system and said the product didn't fit my car. =( Upset face, got trapped.
B001AGHMKE|5|Awesome fit. Easy to install on my 1990 accord. Recommend painting this with primer to prevent rust before you install. Just use a high heat primer like the one they sell for car engines or BBQs.
B002W5U0BK|5|97 XJ 4.0, went right in. It took 30 min, had to cut the rubber flange a little. Big horsepower gain, better gas mileage. For 1/4 the price for major name brands, well worth it. Great Deal!
B00QLN4JKM|1|The bulb were incorrect. Supposed to be white led for the running lights. And switch to amber for blinker. They were amber/greenish for running lights. And then the white leds flashed for blinker while the yellow leds were still Lit, absolutely terrible.
B001OMEPEU|3|Had to remove the 3 metal tabs on the back and then shim it with rubber for it fit on my 66 Mustang. But in the end it works and with my HID lights.
B004NTOCQM|5|Just replaced a walbro pump with this unit. Super quiet and my Grand National is running great again. Did have to remove the bottom part of the fuel pump hanger that the old pump woult sit on because of the design of this pump.
B001HX60NU|5|I bought these for my car. I put them on over 6 moths ago and there are sticking like a champ after several washes and rain. Love THem
B004UPZXQM|5|Great for a quick detail spray.  I got this along with Blacklight and it's super easy to use.  I'ts as simple as spray and wipe.  But it leaves a nice shine behind.
B008BVNMPU|4|this product was good for my 08 chrysler town and country, its just the seat cover  were alittle loose but they still were great and looked good inside my van.. over all they were good and i like the fact that they even send a video on how to install them that was really nice of them
B00B4KP8JS|5|Fit perfect on my Chevy cruze. My first replacement pads. The original acdelco pads and rotors held up for 55,000 miles. Time will tell if these last.
B009SCSXVO|5|I purchased these to relocate a bunch of add on electrical accessories  they mounted easily and look to be good quality if you need them just order them here I looked for several months to try to find them and buy locally no such luck.
B005R91XBO|1|I bought mine from one of their venders with the dual action feature. The cable that goes to the shift knob is too short to work(I had to make an adapter for it), the side shift will only work going out from park to netural then you have to use the button, even when not connected to the trans linkage it doesn't always go into low, the netural safety switch cannot be adjusted so it works in park or netrual. I contacted American Shifter twice and was told someone would contact me within 24 hours. It's been several months and they havent contacted me!
B000BO913C|5|Used this tape for fallen off emblems for my car. It's been 5 months of humidity, rain, and intense sunlight and the emblems haven't moved! It works great! Make sure you take your time, this stuff STAYS
B000C71GWC|5|As described, I would wager all brands come from the same factory, buy whichever is cheapest.
B002VJGZ16|1|Gabriel ready mount strut not so ready.  Strut mounts are on backwards on both items. Left part won't fit either side nor will the right.    [...]    Either I return them, or rent a spring compressor to modify. First time I have ordered auto parts through amazon - will be the last.     Attempting now to find out best way to proceed. So much for trying to save money trusting the internet
B001PYHEWW|5|Good quality
B00BR05EEY|3|Perfect color match, but the ball tip didn't work. I contacted the seller, no refund or replacement was offered.
B000CIY0U6|5|Very heavy duty and it fit well.
B001GC2LVM|3|Works as advertised. It's best suited for a trailer. Leveling a truck with a camper such as I have takes a bit of practice and guesswork as to where to position the leveler's prior to driving on to them.
B0000AXPDU|5|Works just like I'd expect.
B009OBVRY4|5|This works far better than I hoped. I've detailed 3 cars with sealant and wax.  A half day job turned into a 60-90 minute job.<br />If it fails in the next year, I'd buy another.  Bargain product that works well.
B008QXZ5UI|5|Very happy with my purchase, I've installed them in my 1.8T with compatible plugs. Car runs much nicer and starts quicker.
B000C744NU|5|very good
B002XG249O|5|I loved the decal, it was exactly what I wanted and what was shown.  Perfect size for my purpose. Clean and sharp edges and just the right size.
B005ZKSCLY|1|Not compatible , did not work
B000CIUFNM|5|I get compliments all well
B0002SRH7O|5|I have a 1993 car with low miles, (35000 original miles)  HOWEVER-- because of that--the rubber parts are /were deteriorated to the point of no use.  THe rubber boots on the tie rods, ball joints, and the joints of the pitman arm and others, were trashed.  I had no choice but to change.  I got a kit LIKE THIS from a well known tool place.  I think the tools do come in to a HARBOR and are shipped by FREIGHT to each location.  (If I use names, amazon will delete the review).  I put the pitman arm puller on and tightened it, and as I did, the finger on one side snapped off.  Then, It was on very tight but kind of twisted, being held by one side and the bolt. and the threads were damaged when the finger snapped.  So I literally had to remove it with a hammer and a grinder--to cut off a small part that was interfering with removal.<br /><br />I ordered these, and was very reluctant to remove that pitman arm, but I knew it had to come off.  I put the puller on, snugged up the bolt, and turned it one time with a wrench.  I heard some creaking and squeaking, so I made another turn of the wrench.  Before my eyes the pitman arm raised up about 1/8&#34;.  Another turn or 2 of wrench and it was off.<br /><br />Next came the ball joints--and ball joints in a ford crown victoria are a beast.  They even tell you to put them in the freezer and to heat the control arm with a torch--(expand the control arm--where they are held----contract the ball joint by freezing it -smaller).  The separator  for the ball joint  was put on and its kind of like a teeter totter--in that you push down with a bolt (tighten) and it forces the other side up.  So I watched this closely and  slowly but surely see the parts come off the ball joint.  DOwn 2.  The same occured with each part--the tie rod ends, four of them in this car, 2 inner, 2 outer, each was very very tightly pressed on after 21 years and by design, and these tools made fast work.  Most of all nothing was damaged, no one was hurt.  This can be very dangerous, because these tools are forcing a very tight object to come loose.  The amount of energy stored in that tool as the bolt is tightened is incredible.  I've seen pullers come off and put dents in things and so its not something to do without knowing how and with improper tools.  this could be very dangerous.<br /><br />OTC has made the best--the very best tools in every thing they do, and i have 100% confidence in OTC tools are products.  This is at least 50$ cheaper than anyone else has it.  Even ebay --they are used for 25-40$ more than this.  That shows you what a great price this is for this high quality tool set.  There are --well all of them look identical to this.  Thats where the similarity ends.  Dont think a set that looks the same but is 25$ cheaper is a good buy.  You could risk getting hurt or damaging your car, parts, tools, etc.an be very dangerous, because these tools are forcing a very tight object to come loose.

B000182AX6|5|This items works wonderfully and I am very pleased. thank you for your professionalism in the quality of the product and timely shipping.
B002SSGAP6|1|They sent brackets which were improperly welded. I called and they sent a second set...THAT ALSO DIDN'T FIT! Beware dealer installs: They WILL drill your frame ! Special warning to Chevy owners.<br /><br />READ THE EMAILS I SENT TO TORKLIFT.COM.<br /><br />* * * F I R S T  E M A I L * * *<br /><br />I received the second set of C-3206 tie-downs for my 2003 Chevy truck. I hate—literally—to have to say this: THEY DO NOT FIT.<br /><br />Now, before you assume that I am some hard-case customer, let me tell you that the new brackets (which I am aware that you personally supervised in the welding jig, Joel) fit snug on my frame and are true and square.<br /><br />The problem is the top hole on that 45-degree arm. It is still off by about half an inch or more. (No Daryl...1/4” steel cannot be bent or cinched down to the frame…as you said your “engineers” suggested.)<br /><br />I can guarantee you, your jig is off. I suggest going to a junk yard, buying a salvage 2500 HD Chevy frame for $200, chopping it down to 3 feet, and bringing that to your shop.<br /><br />I was absolutely furious but I am cool enough to write this letter now without being mean, and I am actually trying to be helpful. There are only a couple of videos on Youtube (none recent) with Torklift camper tie-down installs and they are all on new Ford F350s. I can only assume that your company doesn’t really deal with Chevy’s…or doesn’t like them…or is just Ford-centric. What is apparent, is that Made in the USA is a myth, and Chinese stuff is not intrinsically inferior. I say this because there is no reason under the sun why I should be getting brackets twice in the mail and you guys can’t get three little holes to line up. It really is ridiculous. I come from a long line of Union craftsmen and I take pride in my work…and I could never have kept a job over the decades if I functioned the way you guys are with me.<br /><br />I know this is not a fluke because the same issue has been mentioned by Hagells…here:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Torklift-C2204-Front-Down-Chevy/product-reviews/B002UC1BO0/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_2?ie=UTF8&filterBy=addTwoStar&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending<br /><br />So now I am left with a dilemma: either return the products to Amazon, and go with the old Happijac system….or drill out the brackets. It might not seem like a big deal…if you own your own shop. But I don’t have a bench vise so I’d have to go to a friend’s garage and use his drill press or corded drill and ½” bit. Then ream the burs and hit the hole with some Krylon. While it’s drying I can re-schedule any trip I had planned.<br /><br />And I have no clue what’s in store for me on the front tie-downs. I can only say I don’t feel warm and fuzzy about installing them.<br /><br />So no, it’s not a big deal…unless a guy pays over $1,000 bucks for a system (which I did…for the rear C3206, the front C2204, and 2 sets of FastGuns). In such a scenario, a guy (me, in particular) expects a product to work when it shows up on his doorstep. I shouldn’t have to dish out that kind of money and then get this kind of grief.<br /><br />What do you think? Am I really an unreasonable customer for shelling out a grand, and expecting your product to fit on my truck? Who knows...you guys sell a lot of product. Maybe you don't care. Anywayz...I just wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />* * * S E C O N D  E M A I L * * *<br /><br />Dear Joel and Daryl,<br /><br />I got the tie-downs installed two days ago (Friday).<br /><br />I also mailed back to you the extra set of tie-downs via the FedEx postage slip you sent.<br /><br />The frame brackets did indeed have to be drilled out.<br /><br />In the box I mailed, you will find that one of the brackets is broken in two. These parts were given to me by the hitch shop that you sent me to. Apparently, the installer tried to use a drift pin to align the holes and the entire weld on the bracket failed.<br /><br />Both being welders, we marveled at how there was zero penetration of the weld into the metal...at either the weld joint, or the original tack. At any rate, it was interesting to see the entire bracket fail.<br /><br />Here’s to hoping my 4,000 lb camper stays on my truck.
B00CNEQYF6|5|Very uneventful purchase, and that's how I like it. Made the purchase, about 5 days later, I received them in the mail.<br />Installation was easy and parts were in new condition.
B001FIDNGO|2|Stop fell off belt within a week.  Maybe if I add epoxy the next time...
B0012ZITJQ|3|One of the bottles leaked everywhere. The whole box was soaked by the time I received the package so I was out one bottle and this is for a Christmas present. Not happy at all
B001PP4TY2|5|I bought one from the website, it cost in total 603.27. It's way less than this one n it's free next day shipping, if u have a newer car (2013) ect.  Then you should order from the website Bc they've made alot of the new cars compatible now.
B005BNP7UO|5|I am so happy with this product.  It is better than I ever thought it would be.  Such a very cool look, especially at night.
B002DZJQ0A|3|it's dual lock, good stuff. I wish I saw it scaled next to a quarter so I knew  how minuscule a sample it was. very easy to smuggle into prison.
B000UVUAFO|1|This is like any other scratch remover products out there. I've tried tons of them and none, not even one would work for me on any scratches. Light or deep it still won't work.
B000RD72LU|5|perfect fit
B006CRT72W|4|the remote works very well, very easy to program with the internet instructions i completely recommend this product for any who need it.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I really like this. Does the job well and came quickly.
B004DL6NV2|5|Finally one the right size. Thanks
B001TJZ6IC|3|I was able to put on the driver and passenger seat covers, but I couldn't figure out how to do the backseat at all. I ended up giving these away to Goodwill after awhile... Not a big loss since I used cashback points to get them. But still pretty disappointed.<br /><br />The covers usually moved a lot and had to have a lot of readjusting. I just gave up on that.
B002QBNH9W|2|auto fuel enricher failed after 100 miles
B00510GHHE|5|Nfl team logo mirror covers are great!
B002HXXNHK|5|Very nice product and it fits perfect.
B00062YTR2|5|If you're a perfectionist like me this is a must have for your carb tuning kit.  Probably a but excessive if you have only one car with vacuum secondaries but if you have a double pumper or more than one car it gives you all the parts you need tune in good, crisp throttle response off idle and when the secondaries kick in.  Has everything you could possibly need, and in multiple quantities.  Helps to use it in conjunction with the cam profile graphs around the internet.  Amazon Super Saver Shipping almost always exceeds the target arrival date so it's nice to save a few bucks and still get your stuff reasonably fast.
B001MSWX3G|5|As advertised.
B002YLRO48|5|Great product, i live in Florida, we get Lovebugs 2x's a year.
B003VAUOX4|4|They work great
B000A8QLUA|1|web site was wrong, this spark did not fit my YZF 600r, had to return items waste of time and money
B001PWFPRU|5|Easy to install and a must have if you have small children.  The tailgate poses a safety threat to children without the Dee Zee Tailgate Assist installed.  Install took twenty minutes and it works wonderfully, be sure to follow instuctions carefully.
B001SLAIZW|5|Easy to install and they look great just what my 2005 Pontiac Sunfire needed.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I love this. I was always trying to retrieve things I dropped and a lot of  times I was not successful. I always had crumbs and dirt down that space that I couldn't get vacuumed out.<br /><br />I love this and will probably buy some for gifts.
B007ZJXU6K|5|Hi thanks a lot
B008F7UCOY|3|These matts are NOT the same matts that came with my truck when I bought it brand new. These are much thinner, lighter, and cheap.
B000DN7Q3S|5|Took my husband about 10 mins to install and they work like a charm!  Also he loved the fact they were made in USA.
B000MG40QW|5|As advertised, they are very bright and white. I'm completely satisfied with these headlights for my '08 Tacoma thus far. Highly recommended if you seek the same in a headlamp.
B00279CDXO|5|Fixed my heater!
B000JZSPBM|5|This is a very good product. Lifts are easy to install and drastically improve the operation of the back hatch now.
B008L4SXI8|3|Seems extremely flimsy, didn't come with nuts or bolts which would have been nice, since the reason people are buying these are mainly because the bolts broke off!
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works perfect with rapid delivery.
B00FGSOSSQ|5|Matches my other cobra emblem
B001F0I5EM|1|Easy to install. Housing matches original. Mirror is distorted and glass shakes when driving. Stay away from this brand, pay a little more and get a higher quality replacement mirror.
B008U1MOM8|3|Well, it does what is say, and resetting check engine light took no time.<br /><br />But before that you have to make it work, and it took a while, especially properly setting it and then removing it.<br /><br />Initially device would not be recognized, so solution was to push it hard. Then good luck removing it, especially taking into account it sits lower in the port then main panel, so long tweezers/pliers  helped.<br /><br />the rest is history using Torque on android.<br /><br />One issue is that I could not find fault code, but this was, most likely, problem of free torque version, not the device (don't quote me on that thought)<br /><br />Would buy something longer and easy-removable next time.
B00AR10Q3I|5|fits good and has a better feel to my car isuzu rodeo. i would buy again. i highly recommend alot better materail then the ones you find at walmart and autozone and same price.
B003S8KS80|2|Did not work with the model specified. Waste of money
B00029X3QC|1|It takes a very good handy man to install them, even had to put washers in the light to keep them from breaking through the lamp  box.  All in all, Cheep, Cheep, Cheep product, but for the price, well, I say it could be much less to be worth it. The lights beam is OK.
B00029WR82|5|I purchased this because it is a better fit than the 5 ft. cable which came withthe original order.Different cars use different lengths of cable.
B0077FIQAW|5|I'm really happy with this product, i was not sure into purchasing the item due to the price and the name brand. I thought to my self should i buy it and take a chance, well that's what i did and till this day my cars has be running fine. Quality is good well constructed compare to others i seen for a lot more, I'm pleased this manufacture has this certain item for sale compare to the leading resale stores there just asking to much for this. I'm going to order another coil since Honda&#34;s are know to have this problem just to have another one in hand. I 'm a happy camper !!!
B002DYH586|3|Even though before I purchased it, I used the vehicle compatibility tool (which said that it was compatible with my truck {Ford F250 Super Duty Crew Cab, 4WD}), when it was installed by my mechanic,we discovered that it's not. The alarm high limit is 60 lbs, and my tires take 70 lbs. I called the manufacturer, who said that it's designed for passenger cars only. It's a good product for what it's designed for. I've lowered my tire pressures down to 55 lbs. when I'm not hauling or towing. If my pressures creep up, I just silence the alarm, but keep an eye on the display.
B005OY9J5O|5|Great decal
B00ID4EE48|4|Wish that it was a little brighter but that is okay. Great buy compared to the Golight which cost several hundred more. The magnetic base on the light it self is strong and works up to 45 M.P.H. maybe more but that is fast as I dare to go with it on top. The remote works from over 30 feet away and the light is responsive to commands. Overall a great buy!
B007IPBEGY|5|Real OEM original sitckers.
B006A44SI0|5|great pads, more stopping power than oem. no problems so far. pads are very quiet. will buy again and recommend
B008WFPCDA|4|It is not the best but it fit OK. The adhesive hold now . Will they come unglued later ???
B004AHAD9C|5|Worked perfectly and arrived on time
B009F590L6|5|This product is very solid and works great. It was pretty easy to install and I am not the most handy person.<br /><br />- Took about an hour to install on a 2007 Ford Escape<br />- It's much easier with two people, but if you have something the right height, it can help support the hitch while you are feeding the bolts through. I happened to have a box that was perfect.<br />- If you are like me and find exploded drawings hard to follow, look for a trailer hitch installation video online. I couldn't find one for this model, but you have to use pull wires (included) to get the bolts in place. I found a video of a different hitch installation that showed that process. It was a snap after that.<br />- Make sure you don't push the bolts back in. On my Escape it would have been somewhat difficult to get them out.<br /><br />Also, it asks you to tighten with a torque wrench. I don't have one and that's the only thing that concerns me. So far it's been fine, but I am going to get a torque wrench just to make sure they are to specs. Last thing I want is for it to break under load and lose the trailer and hitch. Yikes!<br /><br />Hope that helps.
B00F2ZHDU8|5|Worked perfectly! Now I wont have to drain the snow blower every year. Great idea for sure.
B002G38WLI|5|Works for my 2012 Mercedes C300. Beats paying $75 for the dealer to install, and MUCH cleaner look than any of the aftermarket parts available.
B000818Y0O|5|Good medium weight carpet, a little lighter than the original bunk material. Easy to work with, cuts clean. Seems to be holding up well for a 3000lb boat.
B008FUP7TG|5|Looks and fits great!  Made out of metal not plastic so I expect that it will last and was exactly what I wanted.
B000VAXJW0|1|These are not taillights these are little plastic molds of your taillights then they just put Velcro strips on it. I wouldn't waste your money just buy new taillights.
B005JU5W54|4|My first one (ordered in 2012) lasted for one year and 3 months; pretty good, but I was hoping for a little more (e.g., 1.5 years).<br />I bought a replacement in July 2013 and recently I bought a spare one in case it is hard to find in the future.
B001IH8Q0A|5|Perfect
B001RZC1AE|5|Noticed an instant acceleration increase. Also improves throttle response. well worth the money
B0074BO054|2|Item arrived on time as stated, and obviously for the price they are not OEM quality. But they would serve the purpose for which they were purchased if they worked. Unfortunately the D/S turn signal marker didn't work and the P/S halo eyes didn't work either. I plan on returning them for a replacement pair. If this goes well and the replacements function as they should, I'll amend my rating. I guess I'll wait and see. I'll keep everyone updated. 11/15/13, received word back from the supplier, that I can return the lights for a refund, (shipping not included)and I have to pay to send them back. They also stated that they cannot replace them since they don't have any more available. I will say this though.. the one light with the halo rings that did work looked really nice. Too bad.
B0002SRCMO|3|It is working okay.  It would be better if it was a few inches longer.
B00RH85BOS|5|Look awesome on my car's key. Very fashionable and elegant.
B0096A2ZP8|5|Fast delivery plus good quality
B000LVGPP2|5|I got this to be a Christmas gift for my son.  He already has it on the back of his truck and is really happy so far.
B003U91OBM|5|It was perfect and it fit right on. It looks brand new and i looks like it came with the truck straight out of the factory. I must say i love tyc products, thanks guys
B001TNKZB6|5|Awesome Product. Keeps Van from bottoming out. Recommend them on any vehicle. Is as was describe. As we all know many products are not!!
B001892W7G|1|does not work with newer Jeeps
B009VGXIXK|3|IN TODAYS METAL PRODUCTS IT WAS AS EXPECTED. THANKS
B00CIJPU74|5|Stellar
B005O2869G|5|Awesome bumper!  I love it, it look great!  I call it my &#34;deer bouncer&#34;  I do want to know what lights would look best on it.<br />Also, after install my cruise control GAP sensors stopped working..... working on relocating to resolve this issue.
B00BP9LFAO|5|GREAT...Nice item
B00J4P6M68|5|Item didnt fit but they have a great customer service program to correct the situation thank you R1 concepts.<br />The best
B00KLZ65GM|4|Great
B001BGU7HI|5|Great cover for while its in the garage or in the trailer
B0008G1NOI|2|Be warned; this is made of hard plastic, not rubber.  It fits fine (snugly), but because it's stiff --- it's also fairly difficult to remove (have to use screwdriver or pocketknife to pry it out of the receiver).  It looks good, but is a pain if you remove it frequently to put your hitch assembly in the receiver.
B00126IDDC|5|Love it.
B00092893E|5|If you read past reviews, you will soon know that this is a great product. I bought 6 of these during a deal knowing I will always eventually need one. Bought a couple at Autozone in the past for nearly 2X as much but it helped my old car run. Much recommended.
B000MJ22W8|5|Every Subaru owner should have this thing.  The only thing I don't like is that its thin and a little translucent, not as thick as it would seem.  And it took 2 weeks to get to me.  Other than that I love it!
B00HUCG1T0|5|The crossbars are sturdy, well constructed and very easy to install. This is a 5 star purchase with product and seller.
B00OZVA0XC|1|Turns out this aftermarket fender is illegal in most states. Double check your state's fender laws before purchasing. I installed my fenders only to find out a few days later by a cop that they were illegal and would warrant a ticket unless I had them removed. In the one week I had them I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Wheels stick out a few inches on both sides, so tires throw snow, slush, and mud everywhere. It coats the entire side of your jeep not to mention your door handles are covered in crap.<br /><br />These fenders are strictly for off road use only, but you won't find that listed anywhere in the description. Can't believe amazon allows companies to sell products that are illegal in most states without any type of disclaimer.<br /><br />Very disappointed, don't waste your time or money.
B000RFOOO6|5|A+
B001GMX93G|5|This was a great adapter that fit great and worked well. The only downside at all was that the instruction sheet could have been a little more informative,  but overall a grat product.
B0059XCVVO|5|Very thick, quality material. It goes on very easy too and is easy to get any bubbles out due to the &#34;ribbing texture&#34; on the back so air bubbles can escape. Seems to be holding up very well too for being a semi high wear area (I have them on my heel guards on my motorcycle). It also looks incredibly realistic. If I didn't tell you it was just a wrap you'd be hard pressed to tell.
B004OS2KK2|2|Used this to repair a plastic  automotive panel with a tab broken off.  After several attempts and after using most all of the bottle it worked. Not that easy to shape or smooth. I prefer JB weld products or 2 part epoxy over this kit.  I have purchased lots of products over the years from Eastwood and this is my first product I was not happy with.
B000EQCVCK|4|They work perfect on my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. The ride is comfortable, the corning is like a sports car and the rebound on the shocks feels solid. The only reason why I'm giving them a 4 star is because Amazon sent me 1 wrong shock for the front, I went on to get a replacement and it said I could only do a refund so I went down to my local auto part store and had to order one from them.
B000IZGIA8|4|I love this product. Before the Laptop Steering Wheel Desk came along, I could not participate in my World of Warcraft guild raids. They always started just as I was getting off from work, and my hour-long commute precluded me from all the exciting MMORPG action. No more! Now I'm on-time for the raid, I've replaced our top tank for Wrath of the Lich King content, and our progress is better than ever. FOR THE HORDE!
B000CFIC4E|5|These were the OEM plugs that came in the van so they work just like the originals.
B0076OE8YM|5|K&N CAI was easy to install. The CAI looks amazing. Not sure of the increase of HP, I do feel a quicker throttle response. Noticed a 1 to 2 miles per gallon increase on highway speed at 70 mph. I recommend this item for muscle car owners looking for an inexpensive power mod.
B00NLN8A6O|5|Very heavy duty. Straight forward installation.
B00HVHDS8G|5|Great protection foe my key
B008HTI7KQ|5|very bright and easy to apply! the only down fall is I think the suction cups could be aliitle better!
B00K2A4YIM|5|Excelente
B003FBV8ZW|5|Needed something to protect they eyes at night.  Nice sealed glasses
B00HXXNBX0|3|Smaller than their made to look
B002QYD7XU|5|The scents smell really good and last long, this was a good deal, they are not so strong but very mild and pleasant, even if one has allergies, they are not prone to stinging the nose causing sneezes.<br /><br />I would like to try out the other scents as well.
B00YI9WOGM|5|Looks Great Same As My Old Ones
B003BZWQR6|5|Used for work
B001NZ0ASI|1|Delphi was once a proud name in quality automotive parts, but like so many other suppliers these days they have succumbed to the lure of cheap labor in the orient. This compressor came through with the fateful statement \\"Made in China\\" on the box, and it turned out to be just what I feared--a nightmare of poor quality control.<br /><br />After installing the compressor and charging the system, I was shocked to see that the clutch would not engage even though power was present on the wiring harness. Since the clutch half of the connector was virtually inaccessible, I was forced to pump down the system and remove the compressor to try to figure out what was wrong. I soon discovered that one of the connector pins was covered in a hard, non-conductive coating--probably a stray bit of glue or sealant from the manufacturing process. After scraping away this residue with a utility knife, I found the clutch itself worked fine.<br /><br />This lack of quality control ended up costing me hours of time, a new set of sealing washers for the refrigerant lines (which I had to order), and any inclination to use a Delphi P.O.S. compressor in the future. Delphi boasts about making parts for the OEMs--I say God help the carmakers if they are using this junk in their vehicles. And don't bother trying to call Delphi to complain about their products--they do not even give a phone number on the Web site. (They probably got tired of all the irate calls from ticked-off mechanics.)<br /><br />I know that finding parts made in the U.S. is becoming more and more difficult, but you should try to do so if at all possible--and you should avoid anything made in China whenever possible. Heck, I won't even eat Chinese food anymore.
B00BEIUE80|4|I ordered it for my nephew. He liked it very much: It is very comfortable and of good quality. I gave 4. not 5 stars, because at first the plastic part of the helmet smelled very nasty.
B003V57NUQ|4|Nice economical carrier. Went on car easily.
B00ELQ5RPW|3|On order I was assured this item was specifically for my make and model auto.  They do not fit and I am not about to start cutting on them.
B00AA1JS4S|5|Love it - gets the job done.
B00HVHG8D8|5|I just happen to be a huge klutz, and I had dropped both of my key fobs repeatedly, until finally the rings on both broke and I could no longer have one on my key chain.  After replacing the case on one, I added this for extra protection.  It makes my key ring a little prettier and will hopefully help protect them from my clumsiness!
B000COS56U|5|Used it twice and worked it very well
B004940ZNK|5|This turn signal was an exact replacement for my 07 saturn aura. Quick and easy installation, 5 minutes from start to finish. The product was a great fix for the old worn out one.
B0002SRL20|5|Awesome, high quality product.  Worked right out of the package with no issues.
B00BCRMAAS|1|package was damaged. rear seat cover does not fit properly.
B00238EVQQ|3|Not complaining.
B006C1NBMA|1|it did not work when I try to program it to my car and when I tried calling customer care there was no answer so that I can receive help with it
B004O6V05K|3|It's sort of a cheap blinking light that .... I can't believe anyone would think is actually part of a security system.  It doesn't quite keep a steady rhythm.
B000C7TU7K|3|Didn't fit
B005N53AM2|1|Does not fit my wheel. Sending back.
B005V16NV8|4|Excellent !!
B00IOG1SXA|5|super
B0066CPGKK|3|Worked for 2 weeks now it doesn't
B001H1O688|3|It fit my Ford Edge perfectly and appears to be doing what it is supposed to. It gives a good appearance of being locked and secure.This said, it is not &#34;Fort Knox&#34; and I'm certain I could easily break into it using a flat-head screwdriver. If only it was made of steel (it's plastic). Of course, I haven't tried and am hoping any gas thieves aren't that ambitious.
B00GBSE83K|5|Perfect. Many thanks.
B0099RGK5E|4|I want to start out saying that after I got this fixed, it worked great. Very easy to use and all in all pleased with product.<br />The BAD...Out of the box it didn't work after installing the battery. Opened up and found that the negative connection was bent too far back and didn't make contact with battery, bent back and it worked great!
B0019IFERG|5|fit my car just as needed i couldnt ask for more in a product i got exactly what i ordered
B001KNZ3Z8|5|I used these pistons to rebuild both calipers on my honda, combined with a seal rebuild kit these calipers are like new! I had to replace the originals because some monkey before me used pliers to remove the old ones and any gouging can and will cause the pistons to stick in the caliper.
B007S12XCW|5|Get rid of the stock DRZ pegs and buy theses, you wont be sorry. The stock ones are way to slippery when muddy and to small to allow for comfortable stand up riding. The IMS pegs provide a nice wide platform.
B00523AMBC|3|Out put port is small & water is restricted so water pressure is lower than I would like.
B000CAINRK|4|good for my needs
B00B5NPL7I|3|Wires coming from light are pretty short so you'll probably need to buy some extra 12v wire. Lights aren't extremely bright but also not too dim. Worked well for what I wanted to accomplish
B00DMM9UC2|5|These arrived on time and in good shape.  There are no (NO) directions for assembly.  But, just lay the items out on the tool bench and it will become pretty obvious how they go together.  You can then dry fit the items together and put the bar's clamps on the bar, and mount them.  Once assembled they go on fine.  Whole process took 20 minutes.  I think someone complained about them being flimsey.  I thought they are pretty good and I plan to use them to carry a kayak.  They look very good.  In fact they look better than the Jeep brand.  I have them installed on a 2007 Jeep Liberty.  I would buy them again.<br /><br />Now that I have traveled with this on my roof, I noted that there is some wind noise.  I moved the front bar back about 12 inches, and that seemed to help.  Still happy with it.
B00H58CY04|1|No fit the way I thought
B0080QX1KC|4|Overall, a great reflection reducer for my 2014 Taurus. It fit very well (except for one area; more on that later). Velcro included keeps it in place and direcions from vendor on how to install were very good. Only gave it 4 stars because there is an area where the dash is not not covered (probably for a different model Taurus that had something that was in that area. However, it's right in front of the driver and the reflection is sometimes visible. The overall glare reduction is quite good. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0041CA4JA|5|shipped fast great price
B00GYDBPL0|3|I like it but I wish it came with two of them.
B000BPUTL4|4|Well first off it came on time,and its exactly as described. I bought it knowing it was the wrong size, but the plastic is really easy to drill new holes into. So i made it work.
B0002L2MMG|5|good
B00ESZEZJK|1|Hated it
B00QLAQMH8|1|Front lip did not fit the bumper correctly and there was a lot of extra space. Very disappointed
B00TYZLTIO|5|Excellent product. Fits perfectly, goes in and out easily, seems well-made, and very insulating.
B0012I9I98|5|I am currently Contracting for an Engineering firm, doing Construction Inspection on Power lines and Communication lines, and working in some heavily congested traffic areas and need all the visibility I can get!  the Wolo Priority 3 LED Light bar is the way to go!!  Economically priced, compared to other manufacturers and highly visible, to attract other drivers attention!!  I ordered and received this unit in less than 24 hours!  I would Highly recommend this product!
B005R4L1DE|2|They look great on the truck but the red bulb is so dim you are almost guaranteed to get rear ended.  I would not recommend these for that reason alone.
B008E9PIWO|5|Love this RV Cover! It does a really great job of keeping my RV dry and protected from the elements. I would certainly recommend it to a friend.
B0046ID5EK|5|This was a surprise for my wife who had all but demolished her old key fob.  It was very easy to program once you visited the web page and followed the directions.  No issues so far.  Thanks for the Quality product at a price I couldn't pass up.
B0089T01NU|1|It's NOT the correct Subaru OEM code for left side power window<br />But the picture is correct!<br />It's NOT for left side, it's for right side
B004AHD1SW|1|Right part number but wrong part in box.  The part inside box looked nothing like the part pictured on box.
B0097SUNN0|5|Haven't used it yet... But appears pretty easy to work...
B000C9WJU8|5|Good price including delivery on a Wix filter which are some of the highest rated filters. If your not in a hurry for one and can wait a few days this might be the way to go for you.
B003PHXB6U|4|Fits like a glove to the frame of my 2013 VW GTI. Would like the stem to be a little longer to help keep my bike-rack from touching my car when folded up but since I don't expect to carry around a rack without my bike on it it's not really an issue.
B000C846Z0|5|This product fit my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 5.7L like a glove. Apperantly, Stant part # 10330 is also the same radiator cap. I ordered both and compared them. I saw no difference between either. The label on the back said that part # 10330 also fit application of Stant 11330. I don't know why Stant would have two part numbers for the same part.
B003DNL8ZC|5|Very big, excellent quality. I wish it came with some sort of tie down or something to tie up the excess material when you cover a smaller car.    Make sure you check the total length of your car and buy the one that tightly fits.     Amazon's \\"vehicle fitment guide\\" isn't correct. For my car, it was 1 size too big.    I had the cover's excess material tied up. No tie downs or anything. If there's a huge wind storm, the cover will lift and blow away because the wind got under and in through all of the excess material.
B005LPZXJM|5|Easy installation; fit perfectly.<br />Would purchase from them again.
B00FPL1PC6|4|A few MM larger than stock and it is solid, not hollow like the stock one which will snap or rust through 10 years into its use.
B0039OR138|5|I have had these for a while now. I haven't been able to post tip now but these are great. the package came with everything it said but the only thing i don't card for is the quality. they are a little thin.
B005C5EAYU|5|Have wanted...and needed...this for a long time and  I finally broke down and ordered them!
B00496XFO4|4|smaller than the old one  Works fine
B004I0H86C|5|Toyota wanted to charge me $500.00 for speakers and grille covers. All I wanted was the grille covers for the weather beaten pair I had.. Amazon sold me the exact replacement of both for $20.00. Amazing what you can find at amazon.com.
B000COBLGQ|5|It's not a deep amber, but a light yellow, definitely has a nice look, and the Hella bulbs last longer than the off name ones.  The 85 watt should only be used in glass/metal fixtures, using it in a plastic housing runs the risk of overheating and meltdown, even if just a little will distort any good light output from a fog light.
B001MOSBRW|4|I gave this 4/5 starts because it's perfectly functional and gets the job done. Fits perfectly and if I didn't do it myself I wouldn't know it wasn't the original. The 5th star would have been for the feel of the switches, they don't feel as solid and the window lock button feels like it doen't click right, actually it doesn't click at all and it think it would jam easy.<br /><br />I've waited a few days to review this and it hasn't given me any problems since so I think it will be ok. the door lock switch and the window switches all feel ok just not as good as the original.
B001B7E06Q|4|easy install, works great
B002YYZVDQ|2|This item is very cheaply made.  It feels like it's going to fall apart when ever you retract the shade.  It does serve it's purpose for concealing your valubles you may store in the rear from prying eyes (Thieves.
B008RHQ38Q|5|Restored a completely drained battery that would not start or jump and is keeping battery fresh all winter long in Wisconsin
B001HATY36|3|OK
B00C7ON2G6|4|Works as advertised. It removed some minor scratches I had on a windshield.
B003ZIXEFM|5|Great fit thanks
B007N6YWQM|1|When I first got these they were  harder to open than my factory ones. They didn't get any easier to open, they actually got harder. On top of that when it got cold not only were they still hard to open they don't stay open; they slowly start to close until they slam on your head.
B000VUARGQ|5|Like it.  Fits great.  fast shipping.
B000BROATE|5|Perfect
B004O844EM|5|Great deal!
B0023V7HCS|4|Got it on the last receiving day but work fine and installed quickly and has been working as I expected
B00652G4TS|4|So far so accurate but the ability to save and rest the code settings<br /> is confusing and not spelled out clearly enough in direction booklet.<br />I would buy again.
B008G31CVE|5|No problems with shipping everything was in one piece when I received it
B006FXHWKM|5|Keeps my fog lights safe from road debris and looks great doing it. I would recommend removing the fog lights in to install the product. It makes the job so much easier.
B003VFHSBK|5|It is like adding an extra room with a view
B00GUXIP9O|4|The Godspeed Oil Catch Can is a good product for the price. like most people have mentioned you do need to tweak a few things to get the mount to work and to get it to collect the oil. This product did have a strong moth ball smell to it and the packaging but the smell dissipated after disposing of the packaging.
B001BY0A2M|5|this is much better than Windex, etc since it has no alcohol or ammonia. it doesn't streak, and can be used on glass or plastic
B003ZVLL2W|5|just install these and they look awesome. like others say, the hardest part is when you actually drill through the flat shinny roof of you car. i started to panic but finished it...lol. i just hope they dont leak. but from my research, these are not prone to leaking.
B000C2WF0E|5|So far so good worth the investment, check engine lights does not come on like to other locking cap I installed previously.
B0015A4M12|2|This is a great looking key chain for any Nissan owner, but not very durable. The leather is not that great and you will start seeing it come apart after a few months. But hey it's better paying less here than paying the outrageous stealership fees for accessories for you Nissan!
B009AIK1N4|3|It's not very heavy duty and the crevices are not very deep but it still protects more than having nothing on there.
B001GC2LVM|5|If I could give this more stars I would. TT was leveled in seconds. Well worth the money!!!
B000E7YP8W|4|The Rola cargo carrier was a life saver on our recent vacation.  Much easier to obtain items from behind the car rather than up and down from a roof rack.  The swing away system made it easy to get in and out of the back end of my Traverese.  It did not alter the ride at all.  Biggest fear was that we would forget it was there and back into something but the park assist off lights came on when ever we went in reverse so we had a reminder.  I love this item and the only negative thing is that the locks on the cargo trunk are rather flimsy.  However, we did not have any trouble, but it was a concern.
B000BRQ0TW|5|Works!
B000E0E688|5|I bought this because it was recommended by someone on the forums that I chatted with.  A bit pricey I think but a good product nonetheless.  It helps add versatility for adding accessory circuits to your car.
B005BNP7Z4|5|Bought this for my honey bunny as a lil Valentine's Day gift. It hooked up easily and looks nice. We haven't had the peeling issue yet, but then again we've only had it for a couple months so far. I think even if the gold wears away it will still look fine with the outline of the LED lights.
B006ODTS1E|5|The 2012 rails also fit the 2013 model.  Get the installation instructions for the rails before you install them.  You do need to remove the two strips on the roof (one on each side) that come with the vehicle and cut them off above the windshield.  The instructions are a bit confusing on how to disengage the rail clips.  You need to pry up on the inside of the rail to expose the clip then alternately press the two release tabs until disengaged.  I recommend buying some plastic body molding tools to do this.  The instructions say to use an air knife for cutting the rails off but I was able to use a hack saw.  You will probably want to clean up any of the metal filings.  Once the strips are removed the rails are attached simply by screwing them in place with the enclosed Torx screws.
B000COC67O|5|Have aging knee and finally bought a work chair for the garage, this chair is awesome, well built very comfortable. I use the tool tray on the base and it really spreads up clean up having all my tools in one spot. Great product, great price, super fast delivery, most strongly recommend even if you have good knees.
B00LM5FPTI|5|suited well for my black tiburon 06 model,<br />No need to repaint as it is close enough to black.
B002I4VFF0|5|I love this shifter!!! My shifting is way quicker now that installed this product! Awesome!!
B0077T23EI|5|Easy to assemble and works as advertised.  I have a Harley 2013 Wide Glide and the bike rolls in easily and the stand holds it securely.
B000FN6AYC|5|These fit perfect and look great, kind of pricey for plastic - but they are custom for one's vehicle.  Good seller
B00BSD93J2|5|I've recently purchased an old police car. Since I want to eventually put it in a car show, it helps to have as many authentic OEM (original equipment manufacturer) decals on it (the decals that were on the vehicle when it came from the factory) to score as many points with the judges as possible.
B0031I806E|2|Just your typical Chinese rotors. Nothing special and probably not as good as the ones that came with my GMC Envoy. If you need something that is cheap, you found it...
B005N6XUIU|4|Smaller than i expected. Ordered the XL. Fits like a medium....possible large. But looks great!
B00GFTTNNA|5|This is one of the simplest mods that I have done to my Jeep. But it is also one of my favorites. I love the clean look of the matching color instead of the amber markers that stood out like a sore thumb.
B0031XXW4O|5|Worked out great for our RV. It definitely gives us more room in the shower. My husband feels he has more elbow room. much better than the straight rod.
B00CWHUNZ6|5|Good quality.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|All the right fuses for back ups in those just in case scenarios. Helps for hard wired electronics in the ride.
B000CNN4WQ|5|These are great for my older John Deere Tractors. I order a few at a time so I always have some on hand and don't have to drive into town to see if they are in stock. They are lower priced also!
B0060OL34W|4|As posted. Super bright. They seem to still be running juice through them at a low level after accessories turned off. Also, do not forget that old incandescent bulbs are very very hot when yanking out.
B0010GG7YG|5|Buttons work and feel great so far. Also a great price.
B00UGDAVKU|5|This is the second KeyLine product that I have purchased.  Both have performed flawlessly and met every expectation.  I would not hesitate to purchase additional items from their line.
B00HD50BEK|5|cool
B00GJ1PZCM|5|This part arrived in 3 days of ordering it.  The YouTube video and directions from Dorman were perfect in helping to accomplish this task.  Be aware the retaining ring holding this sensor in place was very difficult to get out and even tougher to get back in.  After putting everything back together the problem was resolved.<br /><br />If you drive a Ford Escape fortunately for you they have since recalled this part and is now a dealer replacement.
B003YCEMUA|5|I use cheaper shop rags for cleaning parts inside the engine compartment.    Towels by Doctor Joe are too nice to be used there initially. I use them to clean stuff in the passenger compartment, such as dashboard, windows, and rear view mirror.     The towels do not have lint, so the cleaning process is much simplified.     They are also much more economical than paper towels.
B007ZTAE5A|5|Campgrounds don't always have reliable power towers.  If I need two 110v outlets, sometimes only one works...and the one that doesn't work might not be repairable for days.  With this, I can plug it into a 30-amp and get two standard household-type outlets.  Great device.  Conntek puts out good products!
B007OXCIB0|1|sticky in some spots not sticky in others, was a waste of my $$$
B000S2STJ4|5|Fit perfectly and works like new.
B0002MAHK4|5|i ordered these to replace some standard wedge bulbs that put out the standard yellowish light that just did not match what i was looking for, and these replacements from piaa were spot-on in terms of the light output. they look extremely blue as shown in the product picture, but when they turn on the light is slightly blue-ish white - exactly what i was looking for. i've used piaa bulbs in other applications and have never been disappointed and these are no exception. if you are looking for a nice white light output from your wedge bulbs, these are highly recommended.
B00C7S9K8Q|1|Part was damaged then a friend of  mine  ordered one an it was damaged also
B003B32V5U|4|I learned that I could get to this sending unit behind the rear seat of my car without having to drop the fuel tank.  It is constructed just like the OEM version, including the proper wiring connectors.  The only problem I had was that the new gasket was too thick to be able to be put into place, at least in the slightly awkward position I was working in between the rear seat and the trunk.  But the old gasket worked just fine.  I would have done this job sooner if I had known how easy it would be.
B004WNZ2S6|5|The brightest courtesy LEDs I could find for my 1997 4Runner!
B004L02ZLM|4|Even though I doubted that conspicuity is a real word (it is), the product meets my needs for reflectivity and adhesiveness.  Better priced than most tapes, and a convenient amount on the roll.
B008XCF72I|2|Stock headlight was brighter!!! Only reason for two stars was because they look great. Oh and the &#34;halo&#34; is dim ccfl and you can't see it
B00HXJK71I|5|I love this helmet.  The L fits me a little tight, but it's better than the XL which was way too lose.  I'm hoping the pads will break in to form around the pressure points, but the pressure points aren't unbearable.<br /><br />The visor fogs up pretty easily so there needs to be some solution to keep it from fogging.  I lift my visor up a notch for a temporary solution here and there, but if your'e running in a lot of loose dirt that's not a good long term solution.
B005345DBY|2|itchy, itchy, itchy...
B000CK9JFK|5|Put these on a 1999 Toyota Corolla with no issues.  Comes with a little accessory kit.  Installation is easy.  Purchased with new drums.
B00AQKC7LO|4|These work well.  The base is only about 2 inches in diameter though and one of them starts to buzz if you leave it on for a while.
B000B8JUM0|5|This product is super!  It seals so well that my wife could hardly spin the cap off after being used to our 10 year old worn out cap.  No more check engine lights for us.
B00SZHJFLU|5|Item as described. Fast shipping and delivery. These fit my 2000 Ford Taurus perfectly. If you're looking for headlights for your 00-07 Taurus, I highly recommend you buy them through Artzone.
B000K9XTRC|5|High quality, easy to install of course, it's great.  Easily recommend. Very classy hitch cover.  If you are a Bears fan, it's the way to go!
B0002JMETY|5|Unless you want to use Vise-grips or pipe wrenches and couldn't care less how mangled your new ports get -- not to mention questionable torque values on them -- these octal sockets are an unfortunate necessity for servicing certain (2-piece) port systems.<br />Naturally, the HVAC industry couldn't have made the service ports compatible with normal hex or 12-point sockets.. no no, that simply wouldn't do, that's far too user-friendly.<br /><br />If you happen to need one of these, both the FJC high and low side sockets are of excellent quality. There's no marking on the sockets themselves to indicate brand, so I suspect a single factory pumps these things out and they're merely rebadged for various makes. The FJC's each come shrink wrapped in plastic and then put in a box with their label stuck on it.<br /><br />They're a perfect fit for new ports, but I have to rant one last time: they shouldn't have been necessary! $^&#!%* engineers..
B008697KXC|4|it looks good and feels good, quality wise. Has good weight to it, i like it
B00MB0CYTC|4|Very  nice, plush seat covers.  They are easy to put on and fit well.  The only reason I didn't give the a 5 was because I have dogs, and the seats will collect dog hair and dirt.  I would not recommend them for kids, either, or if you do a lot of off -roading and get dirt in the truck (mine is in mud, on the beach, and with wet, sand covered dogs so they are not ideal for me).  They do look very nice, are soft and will add some class to your truck.
B002VVXKVW|5|Purchased this for a custom installation on a 72 Challenger in the engine bay area where we cleaned up the firewall and moved the location to make the lines run along the fender and you never have enough chrome under the hood. Very high quality product fit and finish was everything that I was expecting.
B000ALDR86|5|I wasn't sure when i made the purchase, but this is Exactly what I needed for my 95 Jeep Wrangler. Works perfectly. Easy to install.
B000JQQQKS|4|Great product, really came in handy!!
B000GRZZJS|5|This is my third set of these and I love them. I have a set on both my KLR650's and now on my CRF450X. I little higher than stock and a tad wider - everything just seems to track better..
B000BZJTAG|5|Great price for a brand new genuine Bosch starter, less than half the price of a rebuilt one.  Works well, no weird whining sounds, just a fast spin and my 2003 Grand Marquis fires up.
B00DDOSPCU|5|Very nice LED replacement bulbs. Installed these in my motor home and my wife loves the soft light.
B001PVUJJU|5|Easy install, and they look great
B000CCDLBQ|4|This VDO voltmeter performs very well and looks good.  However, it's not from Germany anymore because capital chases the lowest costs for materials, labor, and overhead.
B00CZ9A4FA|2|I use it one time it fit but the hook is falling of<br />The same day I wore it it fall out towice<br />It needs to needs more attention .
B00R6TNFQY|5|as expected
B009PIKC4C|5|I didn't expect anything else from Husky Liners. It's a great fit. I also have Husky Liners in my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500.<br />I would buy them again for any new vehicle!
B002YC8BOE|1|lasted only about 4 mos....
B003F06Y34|5|I have bought 4 bottles of this cleaner and cleans it does.<br />Miracle worker.  It is like magic. No scrubbing. I luv it.<br />Can use it on so many things. I highly recommend it.
B001HJR9XE|5|worked great no extra parts needed except for bracket to mount it!
B006VEHO8U|5|Great foam cushions for your seatbelt
B00GZGX8S4|5|Thank you saved my phone!!;)
B00B78764M|5|Great product - not overpowering - eliminates ordor.
B007B5O062|5|Handy little flash light.  It will not permit close of the lid if used in the front power take off port
B0009H51WQ|5|Great price and perfect fit for a 2000 Ford Expedition 4.6L
B008S9QLLC|5|holds gas
B001QIUGVI|5|This scanner is the best price/utility tool i have ever bought, perfect for on the road diagnostics, for on the spot repairs.
B000BPUTQE|5|Fit perfect and product as deceibed. Would definitely buy from seller again.
B000GKD5PQ|4|If you only have one outlet in your car, what do you plug in, your XM radio, or your GPS? Oh wait, the phone just died, need to plug that in too. Well, this solves that problem. You can plug them all in. And good price.
B0060C6JMU|4|Good paint match.  Kind of a crappy bottle and pen mechanism though.  The brush is nice.  The paint match is what matters most though and they got that right.
B004N6L6EG|5|works great removing your motorcycle front wheel
B001XW7UWA|5|It permits the connection of a standard 30 Amp extension cord to my marine-style, 30 Amp camper in-put. If you use a 30 Amp to 15 amp adapter in conjuction with this pigtail, you can use a standard, household 110V extension cord to power your RV or boat (this is why I bought this pigtail). I like having the small LED Power Indicator lamp built into the pigtail. However, the black, threaded locking ring is a little loose and sloppy, but if you don't try to screw it down too tight, it'll function OK. I almost deducted a star for the sloppy lock ring, but it will work and, otherwise, the build quality is good. I would buy it again. No regrets.<br />30 Amp to 15 Amp adapter:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Camco-55223-15M-PowerGrip-Adapter/dp/B00192JGA8/ref=pd_bxgy_lg_text_y
B005N6ZHI6|4|Seems to be a very nice shirt. Have worm a few times and it looks just as good as the day I bought it.
B000C426U6|5|Took me about an hour to install. directions were very good and include pictures to help. I am no car expert other than changing my own oil and a few other small tasks. This is very easy to complete, I did have a 2nd set of hands to assist but its not needed. I've had it installed on my 2003 Tahoe for just over a month now and am very happy with the performance increase, i have zero hesitation on the throttle now and the sound is great. My MPG has increased between 1-2 mpg per tank for about an addition 20-40 miles on a full tank. My only wish is that I would have installed this years ago to increase all the gas savings. Will definitely add this upgrade to any cars I own in the future.
B000PEJ4KI|5|Perfect fit.  It is primo!
B0010G4BZ8|5|Great price! Just what I needed to complete my brake project.
B007W8ULR0|5|This is my 4th Nylon Fanmat.  I love them, they're the perfect size; about the size of a typical doormat.  I do not use them as a doormat, I just use them as accent rugs in my &#34;man cave&#34;.  You can catch them fairly cheap. Also, makes a great gift for friends and family.  Well constructed.  The coloring is slightly off from the picture, however, the photo used is more of a rendering than the actual product.  Despite this difference, it is worth the price.
B009LOS0KS|5|How nice to be able to DIY a simple car repair.  Watch You Tube and your home free.  Visor arrived on my porch in two days. In am happy.
B005ZZH7U6|1|I have a 2006 SR5 Tacoma and a stock front mudflap tore off. The after market product seemed to match up on-line with my truck yr-make-model but when the product arrived and I tried the re:re I was disappointed to find that this could not be farther from the truth.  Not even close enough to make it fit with a little bending.
B00CUNALVI|1|Horrible quality, falls apart.
B00C85OSYO|5|Goods were as advertised.
B000C7YQ9M|5|Works great and fast delivery
B000HUCM9U|4|Item is quality made and as discribed
B00PMXZ1YA|5|Nice
B001O0C2JW|5|Good price and great quality.
B002MQCY7C|4|Very easy to Mount, but in Use, it takes a Little time to find the correct Position to Close it. (Specially with Gloves) Quick Relase but slow Closing.
B00FP6ZSMO|5|Awesome Sticker. Thank you.
B001G7KQN2|5|Fits fine.
B004A3423Y|1|I bought two pieces of these brake drums for my Toyota Camry. Installed new brake shoes and these two new PREMIUM Prime Choice brake drums. After I installed both, test drive my car and there were continuous clicking noise when I step on the brakes. Louder on the right rear and a little on the left rear. I thought my rear brakes were still adjusting because they are new.  After a month of use, still the same loud clicking noise when I step on the brakes. Finally, I searched on the internet what is causing the clicking noise. Few people said brake drums. Maybe I bought a defective pair, lucky me...So,I bought another pair of brake drums. I ordered a pair of Beck Arnley brand but when my order came. I got one Beck Arnley and one Brembo Brand. I replaced my brake drums, and the clicking noise disappeared while stepping on the brakes.<br /> Now, between Beck Arnley brand and Brembo brand, choose the Brembo. Quality and inside smoothness of Brembo is excellent. Plus Brembo is proud of their brand that the red retail box of the brake drum is printed with Brembo all over and Brembo is engraved on the brake drum itself. Ensuring that you are buying the real Brembo drums.
B007VXCYOO|4|It only works as a cargo light. My truck wasn't wired for a 3rd brake light. But it works and looks great. Cheaper than a factory replacement as well, quite a bit cheaper.
B004A32AQK|4|Fit well
B006GQYSVE|5|This is the perfect size for my dashboard.  It's short and doesn't stick up very far.  It seems well-made.  The numbers can be see from any angle and are the perfect size.  The buttons are all on the front and easy to use.  Don't know yet how it will do in the heat of the summer, but I have a carport.  I really got it for the day/date/calendar, but find that having the time keeps me from having to hit the time/station button on my radio to switch between time and radio station display.  I did not want to stick anything to my dashboard so I got one of those dashboard sticky pads (that magically stick to your dash and you can put cell phones on them, etc.) and then I used velcro to stick the clock to the sticky pad and it works great.  The only thing I wish it had was an on/off switch for the backlighting.  The light only works when you push the button and the light doesn't stay on but a couple of seconds after you release the button.  So for a couple of bucks I bought a swimmer's nose clip so at night I put the clip on the button and it stays lit up until I take the clip off.  I make sure to remove the clip when I get out of the car to save battery.  I would highly recommend this product.
B00LX12EEA|2|The lower fairing did not come with the mounting hardware.  I had to improvise to make this work.<br /><br />Also, the tab for the mounting clip on right side was not wide enough because it barely made contact, which might be an issue down the road.
B00DXOEOR0|2|The only thing I didn't like is they stick out to far so I got different ones. They are good and easy to install
B00NTPSKMS|1|Not waterproof at all. After a rainy day you can see them fogging up inside the lens already. I read reviews about leaking lenses that caused lights to stop working so i sent them back before they go out.....
B00BXLAQP4|3|I had been looking at the &#34;z-bars'' for a while... never would've expected them to come as unpainted instead of black as the picture shows. also the title says nothing about them being unpainted. but it was partially my fault that I didn't read the ACTUAL description that does state that they are unpainted bare metal... that's 1 star down... the other star down is because im going to have to grind a few of the edges down because they are pretty rough and if I don't grind them down id end up cutting myself... other than those two things they're exactly what I wanted for my sportster
B0050DCA00|5|It looks better than the stock grey covers. Nice quality.
B0055OOCSM|5|To ensure your saddlebags are secured to your bike without the fear of them vibration off of the motorcycle.  To ensure your saddlebags cannot be pried/ripped from your motorcycle by robbers/vandals.<br />THIS IS THE PRODUCT TO HAVE !!!!!!<br />Easy to install.
B00C0ENZJC|5|Casual and comfortable, classic Porsche Martini Racing t-shirt.
B000C57TRA|5|this coil spring fit perfect ,gained the 2 inches I needed so the tires stopped rubbing the fenders.<br />great service.
B000M3V95U|5|wow finally a glass cleaner with no streaks, I have tons of huge windows, glass tables, mirrors etc in my house and I just cleaned them all and I'm blown away, I should have taken more before and after pics.... I'll post one here , the window on the left was cleaned with Windex, the one on the right is this product. Judge for yourself ! Amazing I will buy again !
B000BZL08A|5|Excelente equipo, pase mi revision de gases sin problemas, barato, facil de instalar. Definitivamente lo recomiendo!
B002J7VX4Y|1|I guess everyone's nose is different but this product did not smell anything like a new car.  I diluted the mixture 2:1 with water and lightly sprayed the interior of my vehicle.  After several hours, I felt that the air freshener smelled like a combination of leather and shoe polish.  I also got a slight headache after using it.
B000BQUUR6|5|I've had one before, so I knew what to expect. Installation was a bit of a hassle because of the way the truck is laid out, not anything to do with the heater. It works great my wife loves it.
B00266Z8LW|1|These led lights were a big disappointment, first their polarity is reversed so would not work.  I had to cut and rewire my OEM plug.  Second the housing of the led cracked on three of the four when plugging it in.  Third they are not even 1/3 as bright as the OEM halogen bulbs.  These led lights are cheap, guess I got what I paid for!
B0073MFVGQ|5|Garage wanted to charge me $250 for a replacement radiator for my 2000 Saturn SL.  I got this one from Amazon and put it in myself.  Not difficult to install.  On thing to note is that I had to use the clips from the original radiator as the ones that came with this radiator did not work with the original bolts.
B000FQBWCY|5|This is the best Charger I have ever used.<br />Does a great job of keeping my batteries topped off, and ready to go.<br />Arrived in 2 days.
B00EL37R8U|5|great
B002IC5Z9Y|3|I bought these rotors along with a set of EBC pads. The price was the lowest I could find. Can't realy complain other than the brakes sqeaked a lot for about a week which I've never had happen before. BMW's go through rotors like candy. Which means I've done this a few times. Shipping was a breeze and free.
B001KYB5WM|1|very dissapointed. decal wasn't represented as show. online it is black outlined, but when it arrived the outlining was done in white. the whole reason i ordered this one is the black outline would show up well on my white car, kinda hard to see white on white!
B00UEC87QS|5|Just as pictured, adds that extra something to your Jeep! Extremely easy to install!!! Can definitely be done by one person, a fun item to add to your Jeep that not only looks good but happens to be functional!
B006B7M5U4|1|Would give this 0 stars if I could. All broke. Will not buy again.
B001MOX7YE|1|I purchased a toyota corrolla masterswitch from Switch Doctor and it did not work!!!! I notified them and finally they instructed me how to send it back at my own expense.  I did so by priority mailing.  The return delivery was unable to deliver the switch and left a notice at the business address.  From August 18,2013 until 26 September 2013 these scammers failed to pick up the returned switch and it is now being returned to me.  DO NOT BUY FROM SWITCH DOCTOR!!!!!  They sent me a bad switch!!! Furthermore I checked their record at BBB and they have had this type of complaint filed against them before.  SWITCH DOCTOR has a bad BBB rating do not do business with them!!!!
B00829I25Q|5|Great alternative over the dealership. My local Toyota dealer wanted 496.00 installed. It's only a 1 hour job on a lift so I guess that means they charge close to $350 for the pump. Glad I looked on Amazon first!
B0076KBPNI|1|It keeps disconnecting and when it is connected it tells me that the car won';t talk to it.  I tried three different cars and none worked, 2003 accent, 1997 gmc safari van and a 1996 bronco.  won't buy this product or another like it again.
B000BRV5VA|5|This is the only stuff I use in my bike.
B006A49J02|5|Delivered on schedule.  No problems.  Recommended oil and not everyone carries it.  Supposedly this is better than Castrol for high performance engines (supposedly 25%, 30%, 40% cleaner than Mobil 1, Valvoline, Castrol Edge Syntec) and Ferrari endorses the higher 40 weight.  BMW USA also recommends.
B0016GRTVU|2|Not as i Expected. The handle is very loose and it doesn't clean the snow completely.
B0041U8C78|5|Had a fender bender and needed to replace the fog lights on the Kia and found these on Amazon. Great price and very good product.
B00AHJZBCG|5|great light!
B000C14HN8|5|This product is excatly as described and worked perfectly for me. The only thing I noticed was the heat sheld was a little cheap in quality, but still works great.
B000YJ053O|1|This could quite possibly be the worst thing I have ever spent money on.  I get it out of the box, hook it up to my 1999 GMC Jimmy, which it says it is compatible with, and it gives me an error message.  Then the tool crashes and all the display says is return for service.  Biggest piece of junk I have ever put my hands on.  DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER!!!
B00068XCQU|5|Great product, great price. Exact product as seen in auto parts store priced at $65.00.  It shipped the same day and receiced in two days (free).
B0009VIQ1A|4|Works well
B00EVQIBQY|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Slim design allows storing about 10-12 credit cards securely. Nice quality for a great price.
B000CIT3N0|5|I'm not a car pro by any means. I have my oil changes done for me, so I can't verify by any means other than how my car runs and any feedback I get from the mechanic. However, I've been pairing this Mobile 1 filter with Castrol Edge 5W-30 in my 2009 Mazda3 for quite awhile now and at 70K my engine still idles nearly just as quiet as when it was new, and it still runs smooth and clean as ever. I've never noticed or been told of any oil burn off. I change it out every 5-6K or 6-7 months and have no issues to speak of. This filter seems to be excellent and it gives me the confidence that most other (cheaper) filters don't. I'll probably never switch brands again.<br /><br />One thing I do know, and is always a good rule to follow: Your oil is only as good as your filter, so invest in a good filter. The Mobile 1 is a great filter and you can't really go wrong with it. Also goes along with the advice: you get what you pay for. If you buy cheap filters, you'll get cheap results.
B001QVG26I|5|factory speakers at a lot less than dealer price and fit perfect because it was the original unit
B0012TWXFI|5|Used these for securing props in a trailer and truck or my daughter's Winter Guard ensemble.  Wonderful way to secure tie down straps in areas that only had railing for hold downs.  No harm, hooks stay put, and very strong.
B0013FXWUG|5|Great product and sounds great
B003RAIX86|5|I didn't realize my car did have the remote capabilities before I ordered so it did not work, they company didn't give me any problems and took it back without any hassle.  I have ordered before from them and the remote worked great and the service was very good.<br /><br />CDM, Alabama
B00DM9SGZW|4|Putting the new bushing was easy because I went to Auto-Zone for a free rental bushing installation tool. Getting the old bushing out was HARD!
B000CM3IGE|5|This part was the exact fit.  I had no trouble putting it on. All the parts were there. I am very satisfied.
B0026M5TNI|5|Fits 03-05 Srt4. Pretty straight forward install
B003OXUPOQ|5|i have both car with this plug and it saves time  wend I change the oil . The valve takes a little getting use to but ones you get a hang of it is easy.
B000BRJVIY|5|Nice incandescent lighting system but uses a lot of power so I went to the LED size
B0076KBPNI|5|Car is a 2001 manual Rav4, Using it with Torque pro on an old Android phone running 2.2<br />Just what I needed. Shipping was inexpensive but took a while (that's fine as advertised).<br />In the mean time got codes for check engine light for free from Autozone. Would definitely recommend.
B005VFWOOE|5|I put this sicker on the back window of my brothers hearse, it was very good detail of a bloody hand print and it looks great.
B00KTID7R6|5|Good product works great
B000C0YR1G|5|This part was 1/2 inch larger than the original part. It may have worked and I will have to find out since they will charge me $6.64 to return a $15 item. Not happy with Amazon. Whatever happened to Amazon Prime Free Returns????????????                                                                                          This is an update to my previous poor review. This part was larger than the original but I installed it anyway and it is working fine so it seems the size made no difference.
B000BO71UC|5|Nice product looks good. Hope it works we'll find out. Best looking one I've seen. I gave it as a gift.
B002BS0ZUY|4|The vest itself fit well and very comfortable, the padding on the back however was not all that great but I was able to upgrade it myself, and the pocket on the inside was not a zipper pocket but just a pocket. However it was a great buy for the price and delivered on time!
B000CF6I40|5|10 min to install and looks great
B00BMVYA66|5|it is excellent as a back rest and helps improve handling by feeling more secure in the saddle bbbbbbbbbbbb vvvvvvvvv
B00B2E6LE2|4|Purchased for my daughter in law to keep her hands warm on cold days.  No complaints.
B00DUHQA3Q|3|Leaves quite a lot of lint, even after washing. I wouldn't recommend them for using on interior of windows, but they are sufficient for exterior use. Not a show car quality product!
B008FIV2DS|5|WE bought this cover a year ago. It is light weight and seams to be doing a very good job protecting are Winnabago Aspect from the California sun.
B00QRANHI4|1|So far, I can't tell that it does anything. Not sure if it works.dont know if it's faulty .
B00DBHCTE4|4|Good and fast
B0031R61DO|5|This brand works great! Second pair I buy for my other car. Color is nice too
B006T7XDNY|5|I ordered this key chain before the holidays and received it very quickly. It was exactly what I wanted although some people may think its small, it's perfect for my use.  Shipping was expedient!
B00IDZUKZE|5|the boyfriend loves them
B001DPV9RO|4|This does the job, but it a bit pricey for such a simple product.  I purchased 2 so that the shipping cost made more sense.
B000BMWXZM|5|Great product, every vehicle should have one I got the 2 and gave one to a friend as a birthday present. Mounted it along my console.
B0016ZNHK8|3|Fel-Pro is a good brand and there is nothing wrong with this gasket, However it does not fit Sucuki Forenza although Amazon says it does. I ended up getting a high temperature/oil resistant RTV gasket maker from my local auto parts store to fix my oil pan leak.<br />Returning the wrong gasket was also a breeze, since Amazon scheduled a UPS pickup. I just had to put it back into the box.
B005WFLIW2|1|Very disappointed the gators keep coming off the fabric.
B003S8BHRQ|5|yes, this key works! I was concerned when I purchased the key since it had no reviews yet when I purchased it. I took the chance just to have a spare key available. Please note you have to have two working keys available so this will be your third. I purchased this key and got it cut for $2 and programmed it myself. Just follow the instructions they put in the package with the key. It is very easy and worked well. I love having the security of knowing that I have a spare key and will not find myself in the need of going to the manufacture and paying a lot more
B0023VFPLS|5|It was easy to install and it fit perfectly. I will use this seller for any of my car needs in the future.
B0002MABLO|4|Nice long heavy duty strap.
B0010ED27I|5|Works great on our RV!
B004LWVEKS|5|This is a very top notch piece of equipment. It is much more than a simple charger. It is a maintainer and that makes all the difference. It increases the life of the batteries and makes them last longer. It is just a huge improvement that will change the way you think about battery chargers. Highly recommended! Worth every dollar. It will save you a Lot more.
B001BJSTNY|5|perfect size, absorbs water and car wash formula, easy to clean, dries quickly. must have for your next car wash mitt
B008EEYWXA|5|Had purchased this part for $200 a week before, had yet to install it then found it on Amazon for half the price! I saved a cool hundred bucks and was able to go to buy 200 chicken McNuggets and 60 cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon and throw a big'ol shin dig at the trailer park! I had such a Jim Dandy of a time, that I'll buy everything from ol' Amazon each and every time Yee Haw!
B000B5QFE4|1|I would give negative stars if i could. this seemed like a great idea at first. after i got them i was in a hurry to leave on vacation to south carolina i live in pa. i installed it was easy but so so very hard to adjust the mirrors i couldent even move the passenger side one. after the winter i was taking my rv to my camp site for the summer and i pulled over to adjust my driver side mirror. i barely touched the thing and it shattered cutting my hand bad. not worth the money. ill look for something better. thanks for nothing.  2007 f150 fx4
B000F285EG|5|What can I say its a piece of rubber that does its job great, keeps the handle from rattling. Everything from High-Lift works
B0009JKI5E|1|I have used mine for about 6 months.  A few days ago I notice one corner had puffed out. Then when I got in the car I noticed a very strong vinegar type of smell. I could not locate the smell & when I moved the sun shade the smell hit me.  The smell is coming from the puffed out part. I do not know what is causing this smell but being from China who knows?  So beware.
B009RXDEHC|4|It's a little easy to accidentally press the button, but I love it other than that. great value for anyone who worries about handing the valet their house keys.
B000H94F6E|5|The small compact size of this charger is a plus for me. Just plug it and forget it. Maintains my boats deep cycle battery very well.
B00BQN5SUW|5|Amazingly easy to install only took my husband 10 minutes to install
B0067UFWVE|1|the threaded bolts break before it is torqued to spec. The product fit perfect, it was an exact replacement. During installation the threaded bolts snapped with ease, far before the recommended torque.  In my opinion, this product is defective .
B00BLAG3D6|5|Very Bright lights even in daylight.  Very effective at moving traffic when responding.
B0049XNHQI|5|Exactly what was pictured
B00VO035ZW|5|Nice coverage. Easy install.
B000CIR1MK|3|Not much to say - they're new. Installed on a '00 GMC Jimmy engine that went into a '89 S10 Blazer. Yes - they fit right on the '00 engine!  The real test will be a few seasons of heat, vibration, & 100°+ temperature variations. Came with only one side covered in protective loom, so I grabbed a section off a junk I have here & did the other side as well. With such a critical part to the life of the engine, I don't want to take any chances with abrasion. The price was right, but they are made in China .... just so you know. Time will tell if I made the right choice here.<br /><br />**UPDATE 2/18/2013**<br />5 years was wishful thinking. Leaks near the filter after just one year of use. Not bad enough to warrant a replacement ... but if I had to do this again, I'd have found a better quality (read: NOT made in China) replacement. Be aware ...
B001CF6LVE|5|Holding up so far, Looks good and protects my tire.  A little stiff at first when putting it on. Not a bad price.
B0001CLFLA|1|I had a problem with the first pump sent it back and the second did the same thing. I contacted Sierra and they said there was a manufacturing problem with this pump and to return and get buy one from a dealer. Sierra was very responsive and apologized for any problems we had.<br />Amazon refunded all of my money including shipping. Amazon is a wonderful company to deal with!!!!!
B0093RRSXS|5|I busted a couple when I was replacing the battery. Also noticed that a couple had fallen off from ither places as well.<br /><br />Ordered these and fit them in under 5 minuted and not there are no loose points for the plastics covering by battery for my INFINITI
B000FPXTEY|1|Received new part, well packaged, in due time. the wrong part for my vehicle. won't work, much too small.cannot be made to work. returned for exchange.Received exchange part, exactly the same part # and all. returned for exchange, received the exact part again. no sense. i'll look elsewhere. thanks
B00JH5O9WE|5|Okay..... I normally make my decision and purchase items by: the number of customers who have reviewed an item, they actual review (the consensus of what was said), the number of stars it has received, if the item is AMAZON PRIME, and price.  With that said, everyone loves to save money.  I have a 2014 Chevy Silverado LTZ (Crew Cab).  I purchased another brand of visor for $15.00 less (being a professional, I will not mention the product name).  Problem:  the rear window visors started to suck in, curve in, and/or cave in towards the window (like, really bad).  So, I sent them back and I spent or invested an extra $15.00 and bought these EGR visors. They fit great; the QUALITY is great; no caving in; THEY WORK GREAT!!!!  Suggestion:  if you have the money, spend an extra $15.00 for quality, looks, your satisfaction, etc.  I love this product.  This product does not have as many reviews as it deserves.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|I have 3 of these sunshades and they are the best. Even bought one for my dad.
B005M2251I|5|Replacement was easy and required nothing more than the flat blade of a putty knife to pop the mirror frame out of the unit and remore the old glue.
B000NK9FKS|5|It worked perfectly!  Not difficult at all.  No warning codes.  Not that loud.
B003BM1KOY|5|Bought this to replace my 03 Silverado. Took off the old cover and installed this in 1 hour. I was hoping to be the hour that others said it took.<br />Next time would have run it a little different (my fault) but it fits nice and tight does not slip or twist. I highly recommend it.
B000EDUUIA|4|Does the job, low profile, and nothing hanging from the ceiling.  Just watching to see how long it stays in place.
B001J89Q98|2|For what I paid for this Sample size can I hope it works and goes a long ways.I've got to remember that the real size of product isnt always what is pictured. I feel duped and betrayed.
B00EPPS986|5|It is too early to have an opinion but until now it works perfect
B003YMRNUG|5|Went on easy and solved my vibration problem!
B000P17NXQ|5|Good controller
B00DU4QBQA|5|This is a great sized sticker for your car. It seems to stand up to the weather pretty well. The colours are nice and correct.
B00E9G0KKQ|5|Works perfect!
B001RNOHBC|3|Does the inverter part well, but when I accidently attached it to a car battery positive to negative and negative to positive, it was instantly destroyed.  The direction that came with the unit claimed it had built in protection from cross wiring it to a battery and that it had a fuse.  When I attempted to change the fuse, I found it soldered to the PWB in a way that was unserviceable, so my only option was to toss it in the trash can.  It was a good product until it went up in smoke.
B007ZDFTD8|5|This is TIGHT!  Looks great and is a nice finishing touch to a person's FJ.  Don't want to talk it up too much cause would hate to see them all over the place.
B00CKING1K|5|Excellent.  Fit my car perfectly.
B003XWEO8Q|3|They're working out after I re-engineered and assembled them, they were Kuryakyn knock offs. The throttle grip doesn't fit into the Harley throttle assembly and still rotate, I had to grind and sand the throttle cable lobes significantly before the throttle would return when released. Two days in the sun and the cement attaching the outer grip to the inner assembly failed and the grip was sliding off the end of the handle bar, Put in my own adhesive and everything is good.<br />The positive side is they look great and feel great, now with a little work they are just what I ordered.
B00EN34U9W|4|Loved it!
B00DU5KLRY|4|When the charger is plugged in it crackles the sound over the radio
B003B30SL4|5|Great quality, installed easily and now have correct reading on fuel gauge.
B00GY55HQW|1|I was looking to improve my lighting at nite but these didn't do the job.  I ordered 5000K and the light output was very blue.  The beam pattern was poor and the halogen hi-beam was totally unacceptable.  Put my Sylvania silverstar ultra lamps back in - MUCH better!
B00EPRBCJC|5|Love them, a breeze to install and they look great. They ride lower than the factory OEM ones but they are much more comfortable imoo.
B005ZFEB6E|5|GREAT MATS
B008P3N0AG|5|Easy install. I would just recommend flipping the main screw upside down, so that the nut is not accessible from below. That way you are protected from someone just coming up and unbolting the entire product from your bike.<br /><br />All in all, very well made product!!
B001GMJHZ0|5|Look Awesome! Makes my Jeep with the 3.5&#34; lift and 35&#34; tires a whole heck of a lot easier to get in now.
B004Y3GQFC|5|as expected
B0027AL1Z4|5|Great quality. Very bright and graphic.
B000EQ76AM|5|Replaced OEM belt with this new belt on a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 5.7.  Very nice belt.
B000FW2MWW|5|Gives great flexibility to where ad how you can charge the battery -- this can be a big deal when it's dead and you are a great distance from the nearest plug.  Much smaller to carry and store than a full size extension chord.
B005CW9V4M|5|I used in a Aprilia Pegaso 650 and it works great
B003WLOECO|5|Fabulous helmet, just as in picture.  This is a sturdy, safe, shiny, cool helmet.  Comfortable to wear, plenty of room for size adjustment in chin strap.
B0049E1LY2|5|super easy to replace. and has been working great for 2k miles
B0022ZZO3O|5|Works great.<br />Cheap cost and cheap built.<br />Good.<br />But use knowing you need to put a drop of super glue or hot glue to keep bulb from vibrating loose. Bulb is incandescent standard miniature screw in base. Bulb is quite resilient, never brakes, just vibrates loose.<br />First one quit because I was always pressing button to hard. My fault, flimsy button needs TLC lighter pressure.<br />Second one quit because I stuffed it into tank pouch and the button got depressed, stayed on and cheap plastic body finally melted. Lasted over a year. My fault.<br />Third one working great. I bought a forth for backup when I finally break the 3rd one.<br />I recommend this lighter, the only thing I know of that you can use on a motorcycle that actually works. Just don't depress the button any longer than need or harder than needed. Light is not too useful for me and slide switch easily left on or accidentally switched on. Light is useful to let you know that the device is connected/not worked loose.<br />It's worth 5 stars because it works well and seller shipped fast with a great overall price.
B00CSZSFZC|5|Sounds GREAT.
B002GWFQUY|5|Owesome products
B001JT74EG|5|thx
B00BMCTDJ4|5|I bought these after a ride in 40 degree weather and rain.  I haven't tried them in rain yet BUT I have worn them in 45 degree weather and I have to say they are pretty warm.  So far so good.  I like them.
B001CEXQSG|5|Good n sturdy.<br /><br />They came with some allen key fitted bolts too, but the factory star key fitted bolts seem to be working fine for the bracket.
B007D5B1DA|3|Not quite as sharp as I would like but looks great from 5 feet away and how often are you really going to look closer than that. Good for the price
B003RWO8OC|5|The cost of the remote was a mere pittence compared to what I would have paid at the dealer not to mention what they would have charged me to program it. It arrived very quickly and in great shape. The instructions were crystal clear. I programmed my remote the first time and have had no problems at all. I have stood up and talked to my car club about \\"World Wide Remotes\\" to tell them what an outstanding service you provide. You will have no shortage of customers, I'm sure of it!
B0016ITCVS|1|This part needs to order by the vin number from a GM dealer for an Oldsmobile Alero. I was provided the wrong part that did connect at each end but the hose routing was incorrect. This caused the hose to brake and drain most of the transmission fluid.
B00ELIKG88|3|This is not a bad flashlight, but, it is also not as advertised.  Here is part of the current description:<br /><br />  High intensity adjustable focus beam, spot or flood<br />  Bulb - Krypton PR mount (P13.5)<br />  Switch - push button with rubber overmold TPR<br />  Beam distance - 40 feet<br />  Water resistant<br /><br />The bulb is not a typical PR bulb mount like many flashlights have, it is a wire terminal mount like a mini-maglite.  The bulb is an actual vacuum, incandescent, bulb without markings so I am not sure if it is Krypton.  It is bright, so it could be.  There isn't a &#34;PR13.5&#34; two wire terminal mount bulb that I can find.  Replacing the bulb might be tough.<br /><br />Seems to be a good flashlight, but, not what I expected because it is incorrectly advertised.
B001F8OX6I|5|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We love these vent covers!  No longer will campground lights keep us awake.  They are vest easy to install and installation was very quick.
B00CW7DNSK|5|Arrived on time and were as advertised Took 5 minutes to change and I can once again stop!!!
B001HBMYDW|5|Plugs arrived as expected. No issues. Very satisfied.
B001GH1LWM|5|I have a 2006 dodge ram 5.7 Laramie and this daystar 1.5\\"  spacer kit fit like a glove it lifted my truck to the perfect height maybe even a little above level which is fine by me, overall it was a really great product
B00B27KM12|3|Looks great on the back plate of my 2013 Charger RT and my 2015 Grand Cherokee Overland. Unfortunately it will not fit correctly on the front of either vehicle. I guess I should have did better investigating prior to purchasing 4 when only 2 will fit.
B003YNG4A0|3|I ordered and returned this Reese hitch (same as hidden hitch and draw tite for this car). The difference in quality is huge. Compared to the competition: The Curt hitch had no sharp metal edges, it had a more robust design with better mounting points, and it had a far thicker and more durable powder coating. Curt actually mechanically etches (read:sands) before powdercoating which is \\"powdercoating 101\\" if you want something to adhere. It was very clear what that meant on the Reese as the thin powdercoating was already flaking off with shiny metal underneath out of the box!<br /><br />Trust me, it's a few bucks cheaper... but having physically held both options in my hands I think I am qualified to say it is not even a question as to which one is the obvious buy. You would never buy anything else if you saw them side by side. The Reese was loaded with powdercoating adhesion failures and sharp edges, it just looked rushed. It will look terrible in no time flat. You won't like the rust dripping down and splashing under your car. If this was for a 1980s pickup - fine ok it will still do the job long enough. But for a new vehicle or someone who cares about quality, skip out on the reese/hh/dt and buy a Curt.
B001CMISCC|4|Fit on my fx35 and block out the Sun rays. Not sure if it cools the car from the summer heat.
B000BYM4YU|5|A little extra glue on tubless tire plugs can't hurt
B009SWL2EO|4|I like the key chain/wrench that's included, as it allows you to really wrench the caps down.  It's a little peace of mind knowing that some yahoo can't just walk by your car, see the caps and perform an impromptu lift.  (Make'em work for it a little, right?)<br /><br />Also, be sure the o-ring inside the cap is seated properly before wrenching down.  (You'll understand what I'm talking about if you purchase them.)
B002MH1P80|4|Nice chaps but watch the sizing. I have to take issue with the customer service advice i got, and the size of the chaps. I contacted their customer service , told them my thigh size, and was told i would definitely need a size XL. Got the chaps, tried them on and they fit, but were right on the borderline of being too loose for my comfort. I thought they would continue to fit like this so i decided to keep them and shortened them 1 snap. After wearing them 2 times they stretched out so much that they wouldn't even stay up. When i first spoke to their C.S. dept. i was told that since i shortened them i was out of luck on a return. After speaking to their customer service dept. a second time and explaining that i purchased the wrong size on their advice, they agreed to issue a full refund and i re-ordered a size large. I have changed my reveiw of this product and company because their C.S. went to proper measure to retain a customer.
B00UAEQX4I|5|These are better than came on a scooter. Right hand was broke. Left was o/k. Put the new one on and noticed right away that the replacement mirorr had a better view even though they looked almost same size. So now going to replace the unbroken one because of the better view from these. Good quality. Inexpensive. Well worth the money. Others cost 2 1/2 times as much. Amazons mirrors
B00J65ILO2|5|While preparing to do a Radiator Flush on my '03 Ford Power-stroke 6.0 Diesel, I looked high and low for the specialized Coolant formulated for Diesel Engines and Cast Iron Blocks. I didn't want the premixed stuff so many companies are now only offering. I prefer to mix my own, that way I know what I'm putting in my expensive Diesel motor. It seems companies are offering premixed coolant only to make more money from us, the customer. After all, do you really know what mixture you are getting?<br /><br />When I mix my own making a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and distilled water, I know I am getting exactly that. And because the straight stuff is only a couple dollars more than the premix, you are getting way more for your money. Coolant of any type is not cheap by no means anyway, why pay what comes out as $4-5 per gallon for distilled water that you can buy for as little as .89 cents at the local market.<br /><br />In the long run, you make out better buying and mixing your own anti-freeze coolant. Plus when you buy in by the case, you have plenty left over for another flush years down the road. This Zerex is made for Diesel engines and certified by CAT EC-1, which regardless of color, if your coolant is going into your Diesel Engine, it better say CAT EC-1 somewhere on the bottle or don't use it in your 20k motor.
B001TNKAK2|5|I installed this easily by myself  in about 15 minutes. It attaches securely and holds my bike rack stably. Perfect for my 2013 Tiguan.
B0055PD1H4|5|Time will tell if this is a good product.
B000EVYHAO|5|Product performs as described by manufacturer. Enables compression testing for deep recessed spark plug holes.
B000ECS8UI|5|2000 Corvette (C5) Borla Straight Pipe; Part # 12649 from Summit Racing.<br /><br />The shop made custom hangers. The hangers supplied will only fit Z06.<br />This system is very loud and aggressive. At a steady highway speed, it's actually defused. Balls to the wall accelerating, this system rocks!!!!
B00GBW82JC|5|Can't wait to emblazon it on my tailgate
B003AW45X8|5|Noticed mine were bad when changing the brakes. comparing prices to local auto parts store is a joke; like $15 each. online is the way to go! Not interested in racing performance, just economical replacement parts and these fit the bill. Wish I knew this was a two pack to do both sides when ordering; I ordered two..doh! still cheaper than one locally.
B000OEDQQW|2|I was expecting something sharper.  Not what I thought in that it didn't scrape the caulk from the tub as I needed. Ended up buying a glass scraper with a razor blade.  I have to say the handle is sturdy, but not sure where I would use it because it is so dull..
B003WL703Y|5|Fits perfect had a couple miss and a couple old ones still. Got a whole new set and I'm glad I did wheels look a lot better now.
B000BL5N4Q|5|Fit perfect, great product
B00T595T1W|2|to complicated to hook up the kill switch if never done it before.  tried to get info on how to do it with no luck.  had to return
B00M9DCMNE|5|Not installed yet. Worked great on a bench test.
B000C53ZSC|5|These springs are great.  I did most of the changes recommended by the lead poster.  My suggested changes are provided as a comment to his post.  These raised the front of my Cherokee 1.5 inches and new rear leafs raised the rear about two inches.  It was a great outcome.
B004VGAJOG|4|GOOD ITEM
B00C0T2V1U|5|As advertised, new and custom fit for vehicle.
B00J62QHKK|4|Came on time, easy to intall. Instructions was a bit hard to understand for someone who is not mechanicaly as I am not. Other then that everything was good.
B0051NO1EM|5|great product
B00DU0E5MG|5|This is the 2nd such jacket I have purchased - the original jacket was purchased from another seller: Leatherup.com, under the Xelement brand.<br />The price was double what I paid for this 2nd jacket.<br />Link: http://www.leatherup.com/p/Mens-Motorcycle-Jackets/Xelement-CF-330-Mens-Grey-Leather/Fabric-Motorcycle-Jacket/42542.html<br /><br />I [still] had the first jacket for 6 years, riding over 50,000 miles through every kind of weather, including icy conditions, hail storms, and Texas 100-plus degree summers.<br /><br />All in all the jacket performed extremely well!<br /><br />It was only this year that the stitching along the left breast area began to come undone.<br /><br />The newer version of this jacket has velcro straps along the sleeves (as opposed to metal snaps).  Personally I am on the fence on this new feature.  I'll reserve opinion on it for now.<br /><br />I have a 44-inch chest, and a size Large fits quite well.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a textile jacket that will work great down to about 38 degrees, hold up against rain, and also allow enough ventilation to commute in a Texas summer, this is a jacket worth considering.
B00JK8DKVE|5|Loved my purchase. Thank you!
B002G3USIS|5|I have a 2001 Mercedes S Class (W220 chassis), and these wipers fit perfectly.  Took all of 15 seconds to install, and the performance is wonderful.  Price is right too!  You will not be disappointed.
B00JMQ0SDC|1|Looks good, but very cheap quality, even in mild Ca. sun, this thing did not even last barely a few months, before fading and flaking all over my vehicle. Do not Buy!!!
B007ISYE1I|5|Sounds great on a 2010 f150
B007DBICFY|5|Very pleased Ariel fan! I love her riding around with me! My car looks even better now! Im so happy
B004A5XJXG|5|This is a long lasting oil filter. I've been using royal purple oil in my vehicles for a few years now and going about 10,000 miles between oil changes. My oil usually comes out fairly clean, but a few oil changes ago it come out very black so I did some research. I was horrified to read stories about people's oil filters collapsing and letting all the sludge flow back through the engine. I cut my old oil filter open( fram). And sure enough my filter was collapsed. So I made the switch to royal purple filters and haven't looked back. Hopefully I get as good of service out of it as I do with the oil. If you are gonna go longer intervals between oil changes RP filters are the way to go. It performs great just like most royal purple products I've tried!
B00D3QQUGG|5|WONDERFUL, GREAT!!  I just bought a 43 foot long RV.  I have never driven anything longer than a long-bed pickup in my life.<br />No honking, everyone gave me a lot of room, a little scared now and then, but great!  I even took the print out for this product to my RV<br />dealer so he can order a set for people who drive the RV'S on test drives.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THEN!!!!!
B001NZKDIA|5|These parts were an exact fit, and with free shipping, they actually cost less than the parts store brand! I would recommend these parts to anyone looking to save a couple of dollars on repairs.
B001F8H5QS|4|Fit nicely they look and feel great a bit hard to put on need someone to hold them i place while your lacing them up
B007CZUIG2|5|Haven't had them for long. So far, love the way it looks.  Just a little sparkle without being gaudy or flashy.
B005EJGSQ2|2|I used it last winter and its gets nice and warm. You can adjust it to either low and high. I started to use it again this winter and the power cord has already started to fray. Very disappointing
B004WMEAF8|5|I bought these to replace another set of led taillights after a bunch of the leds went out.  They give the old expo a fresh look.  They also eliminated the rapid flash turn signal issue that I thought was due to the after market fog light I had installed at the same time as the old taillights.
B008I9SR1E|5|So I waited to review this after using it for about a week to give it a fair review. This helmet is absolutely amazing! It fits true to size, though at first I was terrified it would be too small, but as soon as I got the padding over my ears it fit wonderfully :D And that padding gets used to your head quick enough that I can get it on and off without any pain (I have piercings and plugs, and they don't catch or anything, so if you've got metal in your ears this is a great option for you). It's not terribly heavy but it feels sturdy. The screen doesn't fog at all in warm weather, and in cold weather (i've been driving in around 30 degree weather lately) it does fog but clears right up, so vision really isn't impeded at all. Like most helmets, though, the fog only clears well while you're riding, so at long lights I just lift the visor with the handy dandy ... edge-flippy-uppy-thing? I don't know the word, but it has a small piece that lets you open and close the visor without sticking your fingers all over it, which I love. It's also warm and keeps the wind out really nicely!<br />The only issue I had was a strong new-helmet smell; the first time I wore it I felt kind of high after driving for 10min XD But after a week that's pretty much gone, and I didn't need to febreeze/spray/whatever it.<br />All in all this is an amazing helmet, and for the price it's absolutely a must-get. Also it looks really cool!
B00EAK19XS|5|As advertised with quick shipping
B00332GBE6|5|Delivery was quick works great
B001TXWNLQ|1|The first one didn't work, the replacement didn't work, and I've yet to get my refund.  Junk !
B0002JN2EU|4|Good stuff for an engine that has not been started for a couple of seasons.
B00GUNR73Y|5|Really digging this switch, fairly easy install, didn't quite fit, but it does now! Has a very good feel and lights up very nicely.
B000AY68SO|3|Bought it for my brit wife. The american flag is better
B000C92WJ6|5|They are perfect  !!!
B001KS6FPA|5|bought for the rear window of a honda crv.  seemed to clear the window without streaking thus did it's jobl.  will probably buy this product again
B0002MA3O4|2|I gave this product two stars for two reasons, it's been less than a week since I installed them and there's condensation inside the housing and I never turned them on prior. Secondly, I don't like the way the wiring is set up for these light to come on. They only power up after turning on your headlights. It seems to draw to much amperage through the headlight circuit .<br /><br />I would not recommend these unless you know how to wire circuits from your fuse panel.
B008V606JU|5|Use this on my 352 V8 it worked perfect love this thing was able to upgrade my alternator 100 amp
B006EHAP7Q|5|This thing is awesome!!!  We use it to make s'mores and it works great!!!  Kinda dangerous as you have three completed s'mores when it's done and you have to eat them.  We also use it to cook burgers over the fire!!!
B009YM1AUE|5|GREAT
B009S94RK8|5|Very good replacement for the original Chevy part and at a great price.
B0066KPYTK|2|Looks great (to someone who doesnt play with it or installs it ) warped and didn't bend to shape of the steering wheel emblem causing both sides to not bond and being able to wiggle but the middle bonded so not a complete loss . So once again you get what you pay for
B000FGJR1W|5|Exact item. Perfect fit. Easy installation.
B00DJBGP7O|5|Holds my 60csx on my Dual Sport KLX 250 beautifully!!!!!  Holds Garmin Solid and Secure and takes only5 minutes to install.
B0054YE8AU|5|This worked great for holding misc tools in my van.  Would recommend it highly.  Price is right and it works great.
B004757NQI|5|These wings were really fun to have on my car during 'Halloween season'. They got a lot of compliments and made the car look great. The only downside is that if you are planning to go about 30 mph or higher they do make a slapping noise because the wings hit against your car.
B00SVXS3A2|5|Even though they are cheaper than other anchor points; these work great and are much easier to use than the more expensive one.<br />A definite must have for a RZR
B001GC4HBY|4|Product is super easy to install, ran 1 line for both bags purchased a sepparate T connector to run one Valve creates equal preassure in both bags and easier to monitor preassure.<br /><br />Has slow leaks at connection due to not having perfectly square ends of tubing
B00B27KM12|5|Great frame looks sweet!
B001LNRRM4|5|Great product
B0043TVBYS|3|These gloves are well made and are definitely a good buy for $25. I haven't used them in extreme cold yet, but they look and feel airtight and seem to have good layering. My hands generally run small for men's sizes, so I went with the small. This size is probably too small and I probably should have gone with medium, but the finger length is just right. They are a bit of a challenge to get on and off and are really snug. The webbing part is tight enough to where if I extend my fingers and thumb, the palm is away from my hand and is stretching. But as far as gripping the controls on the bike normally, they are just right, and should allow for two-fingered clutching / breaking if desired. As far as the gauntlets are concerned, I have to remove the rain protectors from the gauntlet compartment before my jacket sleeves can barely go into the gauntlet. So it's a toss-up between small and medium. I don't think the gauntlet is big enough on the small for any winter riding jacket sleeves. This is the main reason I took away a second star.
B00ACP02ZQ|5|Nice
B0002Z9QSK|5|Great product prompt delivery
B00EE56UAG|3|Works ok.  Quality of locking mechanism could use some improvement.
B007RW3448|4|I change the oil and filter on my VROD myself. This filter is somewhat cheaper than the OEM filter (at least here in the middle east), it fits just the same as the OEM and seems to work fine.
B00A757S76|3|Love the look of this clock. It takes 1 D battery. Very cool, my only complaint is that it is a bit loud. Always sounds like a small motor is on.
B000W9XOFW|5|Love these floor mats! They are the same ones as the factory new ones and have the CR-V logo on them. I would buy from this seller again!
B0031ZDU62|5|Put on my 03 mercury mountaineer V8 4.6 . Very impressed. It now runs like new. Great product fast shipping.
B000O0AI8K|1|I really wanted to love this hitch.  Unfortunately, one of the 2 locking mechanisms was a bit sticky when it arrived - and sure enough it locked up on approx the 6th use.  Unfortunately the unit is now useless.  For what it's worth, I had removed the hitch after every use and placed inside the vehicle … in other words this hitch was hardly exposed to the elements.  This, combined with the very short life cycle make it very difficult to give anything other that the lowest rating.<br />PS I made a phone call to the manufacturer and did not get a response from them.  End result is very disappointing as it appears the design and manufacturing both indicate these guys are trying to build a quality product.  Hate to blow them up with a one star review, but what choice do I have?
B000WJBAW6|1|CHEAP, DOESN'T FIT ANYTHING
B00ELHTC5C|5|As stated in other reports, this fluid was purchased for a newer Jeep, which is actually used for off road use (No Street Queens Here).  We are impressed with the reviews and personal observations so far.  We will be using these products for both vehicles in the future.
B000CPIMWQ|2|buyer beware. this product goes down well but be careful about putting it over anything other than a bare metal surface. I put it on top of black VHT Epoxy paint and it attacked the finish.  no amount of prep work for painting prevented this. When it dries it looks good but the areas that were attacked need to be re sprayed. 2 stars for lack of a warning on this reaction.
B0073VJRDU|4|fit my 08 Acadia a little loose but works good
B00265FXTA|5|This Osram Sylvania D1S Xenarc xenon bulb is an exact match to the original bulb for color and brightness in my 2008 BMW X3.<br />I am very happy with the performance of this bulb right out of the box. This bulb was made in Germany as stated in item description.
B00DHPX31I|5|Ive been using different types of sunshades for years these are very good definitely cooler than any I've used, pricey but good. Delivery was ahead of expectations.
B00OC2K0HU|5|Super bright.
B00126IDDC|1|I bought CPI 1575 (new) and it had a very low power output.  I exchanged it for another assuming I got a bad one. I decided to bench test this one before installing. The voltage on this one varied between 89 and 122 volts depending on load. Sent this back for a refund and ordered a Xantrex 1200. The Xantrex 1200 cost more but it works perfect. Luckily Amazon's return policy made the exchages very easy.
B003XXNBKW|5|high quality..good design..perfect fit in my envoy install(small space}..I will consider using these smaller tanks..have been constucting custom abs pipe units@1.5-2.5 quart size @ $30-40.each. abs units created for fit and styling,p
B00NH6K720|5|Awesome
B001AIZ5HY|5|The 3M Headlight Lens Restoration System works amazingly and it was easy, too! I was very pleased with the final result on my 2001 Mazda 626. My headlights were very cloudy at the start. It took me about an hour per headlight. I used a 2500 RPM corded power drill, wore a dust mask, and sat on a chair in front of the headlight in my garage, which made it pretty easy. I dipped each sandpaper in water before use and also when too much dust was created on the headlight, which I would wipe away immediately, so that I could see the progress and also if I had been applying too much pressure at an angle that would make semi-circle gouges, which were removed with a few passes of the same sandpaper. The only thing I wished I had done differently was read the directions thoroughly and cleaned the sandpaper whenever there was dust build-up on it. This would have helped the life of the sandpaper go a little further. There was enough extra sandpaper to do another set of headlights, but because I didn't clean the sandpaper more often, I am a little short. Fortunately, the headlights on my other car, a 2000 Mazda 626, are not in as bad a shape.
B00F202C68|5|Got this for my husband, second time because we got another car that is just for him and he the loves it, good quality and good size as well.and shipping came fast. Definitly reccomend this product to anyone who is thinking but not sure
B009M8LCTE|5|Easy install.
B00098PO3G|5|This Product is outstanding!!! I didnt think such a cheap spray would do such an amazing job. Surely will be buying many more.
B0046I3I8I|4|Used for less than 3 months because we sold the travel trailer.  Inexpensive and not much to look at but they did cover the tires well.
B003O6G3UI|5|Great product that was shipped quickly and everything was just as described. Thanks again!
B007J3LGUO|4|If you are looking for the highest quality mirrors with easy installation these are probably not for you. For the price however, they can't be beat. As most of the reviews say, they took some modifications to get them to fit and stay, but they look awesome on my cafe racer and actually function pretty well.
B000GV256K|4|This is for the non spark arrested unit. they  should mention this in the listing. I fixed by attaching stainless screen material from a sink strainer. $3.00 fix. It didnt change the sound or power. But getting the silencer back together was a real pain. Nice pipe.
B00K5V8OPC|5|love it
B0032H11T2|5|There was too much foam sealer across the front rail.  I removed one layer from each end so the clamps could compress the remainder for a good seal.<br />The rear rail foam has an adhesive surface which, apparently, would stick to the top of the tail-gate.  I have left the tape on that for now but expect I'll have to deal with it at some point when it attaches itself.<br />I found installation (with 2 people) reasonably easy but would recommend a dry run before peeling off the tape.  I assembled mine (without the cover or supports) removed the tape then stuck the front rail and worked back along the sides without taking it apart.<br />Cover went on easily and looks great.  I'll see how it stands up under the winter's snow.  Nice it comes with a limited lifetime warranty.<br />Good deal for the money.
B001EOYJ7G|5|Fits and works well withour 2014 Mercury Grand Marquis.  Good solid hitch.  All the nuts and bolts are suppied that you need.  A good buy.
B002YXZ178|5|Worth the money they look great . Fit perfectly and shipment was so timely  will order again in the  near future
B0038QGREQ|5|Looks real funky.
B009DJTOS8|5|Nice quality part. Chrome is super nice . Fit perfectly,stock badge fit as well.
B00AMPHOFC|5|Amazing product affordable and fast shipping
B000NPGX9E|5|Nice, long hose lets you put the can wherever you need to. Big, knurled fittings, easy to tighten.
B007OTGZOK|4|it was just about what i expected. so far so good have had it long.  will see how it does though out the year.
B000LG0BGQ|5|My original key fob was draining through batteries at lightening speed and then finally stopped working all together.  I wish I would've searched on amazon sooner to discover that I could buy a universal replacement.  Great buy!
B00GRSOJSS|5|Removes the rust!
B005N6XDHS|2|When I order clothes I am careful about the sizes because I hate, HATE to return things. When this shirt arrived it was, first off, the wrong size, even tho it says I ordered a large, I double checked before I ordered that it was a x-large something happened there that changed the size... Second, When it arrived I was super excited to get it and it was so small and stiff that I couldn't even give it to my teenage daughters to wear because it was so tiny. And they are athletic and small framed. It looked like it would have fit a 10 yr old. I did end up having to return it, one great thing is that amazon has a great return set up. UPS came to my house with a prepaid label and picked up the shirt that I stuffed into a shipping envelope and shipped it off for me. That saved me some time and money. That is the only reason it got two stars
B000CEBM6U|5|Graphics are great. The<br />The logos are not just stuck on. They're part of the metal itself. Won't wash off as some do. Built well.
B000K4YKH0|3|I found that the lens will fog up quickly after being worn in a warm and humid environment. I would spend a little more to get something nicer if planning to use these daily.
B000TYVWPO|5|This seems like a good quality product.  The only drawback is the black color.  This needed to be painted to factory color to match our car. Painting properly is a multi-step process. In order to complete installation, the door panel must be removed, then many other internal parts with linkages, and be reassembled.  I probably will ask my mechanic to complete the installation.
B0009VD1II|5|The LeBra came in a timely manner, as promised.  It was purchased to cover a little fender damage, and it worked perfectly, and also looks great.  It was also very easy to put on the car.  Good purchase.
B004J9LC96|5|Delivered on time, installed in under 5 minutes.  Product exactly as described.  I am thrilled to have found the product on Amazon.com at a much lower price than in any auto parts store.  Shipped to our home in less than 2 days made the experience even more wonderful !  Thanks !!!
B00KDP9IQO|5|As expected. Easy to change.
B00BQAKYHC|5|It took me three times of use before I had a successful streak-free windshied (inside).<br /><br />This is a VERY GOOD product - but it *must* be diluted, which is OK with me - it means I'm getting a lot more product for the money.  Using this product straight resulted in the most horrible streaks possible, and I hated the results.  I read other reviews about diluting it, and I settled on a dilution ratio of  2oz product mixed with 18oz of distilled water.  And tried again on the inside windshield...Still had some residual streaks, but not real bad .. but I'm looking for perfect!  So I re-read hints/tips on proper window washing techniques and learned that I should use three separate cloths, I always just used two.<br /><br />Step 1) Spay DILUTED product lightly!<br />Step 2) Use one cloth to clean the glass, use a fresh side of the cloth as needed to keep from pushing dirt around. Use more product LIGHTLY.<br />Step 3) Dry with another cloth, use a fresh side of the cloth when moving from section to section of glass.<br />Step 4) BUFF with the 3rd cloth, again - use a fresh side of the buffing cloth when moving from section to section of glass.<br /><br />This resulted in a super clear, super clean interior windsheild.  If the dash wasn't reflecting into the glass I'd swear the glass was not there...it is that good!
B005NFHRDA|5|Top of the line
B0006IX698|5|just what I needed all these years.
B00L452E40|4|Good product for price.
B000GZT032|2|Does not work well. My atv is still load. May help a little while at idle that's all. Simple to install.
B00XQVA6GI|5|I am a very neat person – I like to keep my surroundings tidy and have everything in its place EXCEPT – the trunk of my car has always looked like an explosion at a thrift store.  I have my “stuff” along with the items my husband says “needs” to be in a car trunk – I don’t know what this “stuff” is but he makes me put it there.  When I go to the market I generally just set the bags inside and drive so I’ve added year old cans of tomato soup that have wiggled out of the bags and into dark recesses.<br /><br />Anyway – that sets the scene.  With the AwesomeWare™ Folding Auto Trunk Organizer I now have somewhere to consolidate and systematize all of the items.  When closed it’s about the size of a loose-leaf notebook but it opens to an amazing 24 x 10 x 15. It’s a 3-compartment repository for all things trunk-ish.  On the outside are 2 additional closed pouches and along another side are 4 net pockets.  There are handles so you can use this as a tote – but to be honest – I’ve already filled my organizer up with about a ton of items and there is no way that I could carry them in one load.  I’m probably going to purchase an additional one. To me this is such a well-designed addition to car that all I can say is BRAVO.
B003YKXTSI|4|I totally love this keychain. A LOT. But the clip holding it on to the key ring broke very quickly. Looking into a fix. Also know the LED isn't extremely bright... Like, pitch black room and it'll get like 3 feet in front of you on the floor. But SUPER good to have and a GREAT BUY!
B00HKSMWU6|5|Excelent
B0049LAW6I|5|Great stuff
B001P4CW4W|5|It's good. This one seems pretty good compared to some of the others reviewed on Amazon. Sold construction... it's a WIX filter, great company reputation.
B000XTPO2M|4|The lock is heavy, about 5 pounds. Comes with two keys.
B004NCZOF2|5|Totally what I expected. Great Service.
B00FBI41VK|5|Looks great even do it not fit the entire bumper.
B001C6JCGY|5|Purchased this switch to replace the one in my 1999 Chevy G-2500 cargo van.  It was an exact match and works great.  There was one other replacement switch I found on another site that was a few bucks cheaper but it didn't quite look the same as what I had.  I'm glad I got this one.
B00BDMQCEW|5|These mats fit perfectly and completely protect the floors in our 2013 dart rallye. Considering purchasing the trunk liner also
B00AQZC0AM|5|Worked great & fast delivery
B006B3C3IW|5|Perfect fit.
B002CN2812|5|Fit perfect. Couldn't be more happier. Thank you.
B005FNKFYS|5|Had one of these before, great product, uses the same key as ignition
B00MN9DNNW|4|They are pretty bright and nice
B002D7MOLG|5|Works great, the leak stops once is install acording to instruction.  Great.  Jalo muy bien mi VW me salia mas caro ponerle anticongelante que repararlo.
B001I192GS|1|I bought this sticker along with the Alice in Chains one from the same seller and both were cheap in quality. I had a difficult time getting both removed then once applied to the surface, they did not want to stick.  I bought several other stickers from other vendors. Not only were those stickers cheaper in price, they worked better, were less difficult to remove from their packaging and they successfully stuck, whereas these would not stick. Each sticker cost over $3, leaving me out $7 for some really lousy stickers.
B001PYO1YQ|5|SO FAR IT IS WORKING VERY WELL. BUT I HAVE ONLY HAD IT TWO MONTHS.  I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN.  VERY GOOD PRICE.
B001GNFLFE|5|I wanted something that would cut out my 300 from the herd so after paying attention to the 300s rolling around NYC I came to the conclusion that this grill was unique and pretty rare on the street so I did my homework on it and copped it. First of all, I was blown away that it came via FREE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING...WOW!!!, I had to actually wait 4 days before I could even leave feedback for U.S.Speed. Right away I was impressed by it's solid, heavy and uniform construction. The craftsmanship was readily evident when looking at the professional, neat and tight welds and the acutely even patterned mesh...this was a work of art! I have Chrysler's actual repair and maintenance manual in .pdf format and the installation instructions included with the grill mirrored Chrysler's manual on how to remove the fascia down to the smallest detail. I had the fascia off, masked, painted, drilled, grill installed, wings emblem mounted and fascia back on in under three hours; I wish everything came together so easily. I can't begin to tell you how different my 300 looks for the better with this grill on her. Four days installed and already at least 10 people have asked about or commented on the grill; 300 owners and civilians alike. I've posted some pix of my 300 on the products page so you can decide for yourself if this grill is head and shoulders over the stock and other also ran grills out there. Peace.
B002QTUT6S|5|Very cute and I like the way it looks a lot.  It is not the normal clover.  it has the great Celtic look to it.
B000CJ8CZY|5|My HP2 was idling rough and the throttle response wasn't smooth.  I installed the NGK's and the engine improvement was immediate.
B0064SY1T8|5|I never wanted to mount my phone in my truck. I don't like unnecessary stuff on the dash. I'd rather spend two grand to have a built in factory GPS than a $200 portable one. It's stupid, I know. Well, I recently started using Waze for directions and traffic on my phone and there wasn't a good place to set it in my truck to let it charge and view easily. I decided to break down and look for solutions. The design of this product is perfect and it's quality upon receiving it was just as good.<br /><br />You have to mount a little 1&#34; x 1&#34; square magnet that the mount can attach to. This allows you to take the mount off and not have anything permanent other than the tiny square on your dash. (I am going to experiment with mounting this behind the plastic for a totally invisible installation, but haven't had the time)<br /><br />You also have to attach a little round magnet to the back of your phone or case. One friend found this annoying as your phone won't lay flat on it's back anymore. I don't mind it at all.<br /><br />I have taken this all around the country and on rough rural roads and it has always stayed secure. I am also able to push the home button at the bottom of the phone without it coming off of the mount. It's extremely easy to take on and off when getting in and out of your vehicle.<br /><br />Bottom line is this is the cleanest, easiest mount that I could find and the only one I'll use.
B0087XOTWW|5|I installed these as my reverse lights on my BRZ and they look and work great! I can see more area clearly with these. They are not as bright as I originally hoped though.
B00BCRMB34|5|Nice product looks great
B00431PPDO|5|I carry a ton of gear in my jeep, and this allows me to organize it so that the stuff on the bottom of the pile is accessible without having to unload everything. Specifically, I have a bunch of vehicle recovery gear in milk crates, and they fit perfectly underneath the platform.
B001FRE1E8|4|Price was better that the local retailers.  A switch is a switch is a switch, Lowes can keep theirs !
B000GU24J4|2|It's a piece of soft plastic. It melts like hot knife in butter. However it's great for winter storage since it's a comets waterproof.
B008MPMB8O|5|these lights get noticed. for the price , nice item
B005NLQAHS|5|This fixed my problems on both vehicles. I do have the Torque app in my tablet and smart Android cell phone. Cant beat the price and ease of operation. VERY ACCURATE!!!
B004A40AVQ|5|fast and wonderful
B00EDWF1BE|5|Work great, look great. No more hood flutter. Something like these should come stock on wranglers.
B004M02RL4|5|FIT PERFECT
B005FG5PG8|5|Fit my 2008 Forester 2.5x perfectly.  Excellent quality, looks OEM, plug and play.  Now if only I could buy a rear quarter panel on Amazon...
B002MEJB1Q|2|Straps to hold it on came undone/raveled after only a month of use, and I am the only person who uses my car, so below average.
B003G9I4DW|5|water heater is working again
B00BKNPN8A|5|January, 2015 Nice and bright. To be honest, I have projector headlights on my 2014 R1 and I previously had 35w ballasts. I switched them out with these and its a little brighter, but nothing too crazy. Be sure you run a relay harness to protect your stock harness. My previous bike had a short because I ran HID's without a relay harness. Ended up causing all of the lights to constantly dim on and off. The repair would have costed over a G, so I bought a new bike.  UPDATE February 15, 2016*** Over a year later and no issues at all. The ballasts are running strong, and even the bulbs are doing well (NOTE: the bulbs I used were Kensun 35 watt, 5000k bulbs. I've heard there is no different between 35 watt and 55 watt bulbs, but they are working fine.). I used to be big on Kensun because they would send me replacement ballasts after their burned out in a couple months, but with these I don't need replacements. I will update once these ballasts fail.
B009FU4R5U|4|I'm going to give this a mixed review. I have always preferred Bilstein shocks for my vehicles and have never been disappointed. I wasn't this time either, but I just simply ordered the wrong part for my vehicle. I have a 2003 VW Jetta that these were going to replace the original factory rear shocks. The removal and installation was straightforward. The shocks did what they were designed to do. However, being an HD shock, they made my ride harsher than I realized they would. I've had Bilstein HD shocks on my trucks and SUVs before and they work great in those applications. These on a sedan are great for cornering and quick maneuvering. However, on a daily driver, the ride needs to be a bit more forgiving. I returned these in exchange for the &#34;Sport&#34; version and am happy with the product.
B00QL6OZ44|5|Exactly what I wanted, same quality as Toyota oem switches.
B003ZWL24S|4|Perfect fit. I had a can of paint made at the local O'Reilly's, could never tell it was replaced.
B00OYR8MVO|2|Output is week compared to the truck-lite headlight. Beam pattern is also lacking.
B00480J4PU|2|Almost no visible difference between my old yellow bulb and this &#34;CrystalVision Ultra&#34; one.
B00HJ15H24|1|Cancellation
B000CIQ47S|5|Worked perfectly in my lawn mower and cant beat the product for the price.  Item came properly gapped and required less than a few minutes to install.
B002R1DCT6|3|To be honest I was a bit disappointed with this item item.Fitment is not bad out of ten I probably give it a 9 material quality is not bad either to be fair I would say an 8 but it has one flaw that I really dislike and is that the outer trim is made out of thin plastic and worse is that is loose because it just pops in and its hold by some plastic tabs and not by screws like OEM. Washing the truck it came loose a few times and I was using a sponge so is not like I applied to much force.I fix it with some tie wraps ans it's almost invisible with hood closed but with the hood opens it visible so being a bit obsessive compulsive myself it kinds of gets on my nerves so I have to think in some other way of fixing it.
B00AU6L4J0|5|Looked far and wide for an original glitter wheel from the 60's...found one at a swap meet..but it was lacking this horn button...got a great deal on a great finishing touch product....
B004BL71JM|5|Exact part. Adequate packaging for transit. Purchased for 06 Acura TSX.
B00NLRCUL6|5|Perfect match
B0054YMYQK|5|I bought this sticker for my daughter who has two shelties, she loves it and has it on her truck.
B00121BPI2|3|If this were to be at least 8OZ it would worth the money, but 2 OZ doesn't go far. They forget that you leave 1/4 of an OZ in the bottle. I bought two kits for two cars, I needed at least double the amount to finish. Even though this is good stuff, Two OZ is a rip off .....YOU MAY NOT GET YOUR WHOLE CAR DONE...
B00AKEWL30|4|appears to be much better than original
B006WY8VFY|4|The mirror didnt fit completely as it said it would but I was still able to use it. It was a decent price so I can't complain too much.
B007SAC69I|5|Easy to install
B005FYJ5B6|5|It fixed my issue with dimming interior lights! 105amp alternator, Big 3 on 1500w rms and it takes it like a champ, never dropping below 12.7v full tilt.
B001LHVOVK|5|Definitely a great thing to keep in your trunk. Quick and easy to use, and also allows you to reset the CEL whenever needed.
B004GCKQUC|2|Not the mirror i recieved the one i have is much bigger. Pretty disapointing because ivwas lookingvfor small sport mirrors like is shown
B0002KR88A|4|The wire is 10AWG and the item seems heavy duty. As previous reviewers have stated about the \\"In-line ACT Water-resistant Fuse Holder - 10 AWG\\" the fuse cover fits very loosely and will not stay in place. I will have to use a zip tie or something to keep the cover in place, but I am satisfied because the wire and holder is so beefy.
B000C9N9ZC|5|Shipping was very speedy. This was an exact replacement for O.E.M..  Easy to install and it works just fine.  The \\"quick-disconnect\\" fittings on the old unit did not disconnect exactly as my repair manual stated, but not too difficult to figure out.
B001BTLP6C|5|I bought this item for my wife and she loves it! It's not only a rather stylish MC jacket, I liked the idea that it had Level 3 armor protection although the inside armor is easily removable if one wants to wear the jacket without the protective armor when not riding on a MC or for 'whatever' reasons. One thing -- although my wife generally takes a small size, most folks I know into MC riding like some 'movement' within a MC jacket versus a tight or, as they say, 'mummy' fit, so on a gamble I ordered the medium for her and it was perfect! Not tight but not overly loose either. It was just right. It has 'single' large zippers [versus those 'double' type zippers which can be a drag and a half to fasten!] and the jacket really looks sharp! While pink is her favorite color, the black brings the right amount of color 'balance' to the jacket [IMO anyway] and thereby accents the overall great looks of the MC jacket for a female rider. Together with a black helmet [** heaven forbid any color clashes between the MC jacket and the helmet which to me is a matter of total indifference but then hey, if 'she' is happy with such color coordination issues, then 'I' am happy!], anyway, her black helmet duly compliments the jacket. It also has a liner and thereby can be extended from MC or ATV usage use to snow machines in winter! It also has excellent visibility [mixed with that pink color] which these days and 'especially' on a MC is a decided consideration for, shall we say, non observant \\"cagers\\" whose famous words seem to be, \\"But Officer, I never saw the motorcycle ...until it was too late!\\"<br /><br />Catching a sale was nice too since it originally sold for $109. Bottom line, she is very pleased with it. And 'that' pleases me tremendously! ;-)<br /><br />Doc Tony
B0009N0W60|4|not too bad, the threaded posts could be a bit longer though.
B0002F68JU|4|Pleased with the product but need to add more fasteners because it sags especially at corners.
B007V2CBJ8|3|It's an okay shade...does what it's supposed to. Buyer beware, though; my model (Mazda CX-7), is 2 pieces and does not include a storage bag of some sort. For the price, it should.
B001F115FW|3|I figured for the price I would give it a try. It is sold as cherry but the one I recieved has no cherry smell at all. The soap has a fair amount of pumice/grit to it but did not clean as well as the gojo cherry soap it replaced. I use it throughout the day but before going home for the night I use another soap to get my hands and arms all the way clean. I work as an auto mechanic and have to wash repeatedly throughout the day and the shops soap works but dries out my arms quite a bit. That is why I use 2 now.<br />If you are looking for an inexpensive soap for minor hand cleaning this one would work. If you are going to be up to your elbows in grease I would recommend the gojo cherry soap.
B009ABUM44|5|I love my new shades. I can drive and safely and do whatever it is we do when we drive. The one this I would change... I would make them more wrap-around. I have to turn my head a extra Inch or so to check my blind spot. Kinda irritating but worth it.
B00KGOG4CI|4|fits the car pretty well.  Doesnt quite match the tan interior
B00JBIRBYA|1|Very Very Weak. I have to check to be sure the lights are on when I get in the car at night.
B001BDPGB8|5|Works with HEI cap. Wires were or made. Very nice to have and works well
B00PCUE054|5|Actually, my sister loves it. Looks good, sticks well, nice product, great price.
B001AZLQ8O|5|This sticker is high quality and nicely printed. Should last for a long time. Love the message.  Peace and Love!
B00ENLVSUS|5|I needed a fuse to rebuild a light ballast. I was drawn to the price and shipping information of this item. I received the fuses in a couple of days and had my light working an hour later. Good quality, fast service and excellent price. I will order again.
B00PBDSVLQ|5|WORKED FINE USED AS A JOKE
B001CO1AH0|5|Product came as described and fits as intended on the intake. Easy to install and came pre oiled which is nice.
B00BJJZ2QS|5|Perfect, the install was great and it does exactly what it is suppose to do.
B000CHPKCO|2|It has no anti-skip memory. Both normal and MP3 CDs skip. The USB port doesn't recognize there's anything plugged into it most of the time. I've tried several different flash drives. USB playback is choppy if your mp3s are high quality (320Kbps). If they're lower quality than that, it will play fine. There are no next/previous folder buttons. Navigating an mp3 CD with just next/previous track and the +/- 10 tracks buttons is annoying. With a normal CD, it will remember where you left off and resume next time you turn the car on. With MP3 CDs, it starts over from the beginning every time. It is not worth the retail price of over $200. I am happy with it because I only paid $60 for the unit and installed it myself.
B00A6BVB74|4|Good fit over all. Sags more than I would like in the middle but gets the job done. Keeps sun out.
B00JIIZCM6|2|I hate to be the first negative review, but this product did not work for me.  I have some dog prints on my back car seats and was hoping this would work.  The directions say to leave on for 2-3 minutes for stubborn dirt/stains, I did just that and nothing happened.  I tried it a few times over the period of a few days to give the product a fair shot but still nothing.  I've uploaded a picture as well.  The product did not smell like leather either.  Maybe I got a bad batch?  Two stars given for the free microfiber towel and size of the spray bottle for the price.  I will be returning the product.
B000EH2SPO|5|It's exactly as pictured.  It's a funnel.
B00ZH00RTW|5|Great quality for the price.  All the tools feel solid and the light board has a long cord.
B0048F5WBA|5|Its a perfect fit in my 98 Civic. Looks great, just lay it out flat for a few days before putting it in your car.
B003BKUAVU|5|works perfect and looks good
B00BOVDCPE|4|Holds the new EZ pass units firmly in place and it is not an eye sore.<br />So far it has been very durable.<br />2 thumbs up !
B00G27LHYS|5|Very nice, good size
B001LA34VA|4|Cute doxie!
B002XL2IG8|4|it is excatly what I was looking for
B003RWL426|4|Excellent  price, deliver sooner than anticipated, it was very easy to set it up.<br />No need to go to the dealership, husband is happy.
B003C5VOGY|5|Got this for my boyfriend, a Dodge fan. He put it on his Dodge Ram right away :) Arrived on time, great price.
B003IOITIK|5|I have held off purchasing a OBD reader and now that I have one wish I had gotten one years ago.<br />Engine warning lights used to cause panic attacks but now I just plug the reader in and screw around as a mechanic for a while and fix the issue myself. How cool is that.<br />Get an OBD reader. This one does all that I have needed with my 99 Volvo V70.
B004A2IJDY|5|fit perfectly and solved my problem
B000UNNV6W|5|Thule tire chains are of very high quality. The transaction was handled professionally and the tire chains arrived reasonably quick.
B001AYR34G|3|I bought these seat covers for my 2007 Subaru Forester to protect the seats from dog hair and dirt. The front seat covers fit pretty well but after a few months, I noticed that a small hole is forming at one of the seams. The back seat cover is a bit trickier. You actually have to remove the bench seat to install the cover properly. I don't have a clue how to do this, so I just put it on without removing the seat, as best I could. It \\"pooches\\" up in a lot of spots and the rear headrest covers don't fit very well. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably just buy front seat covers and use an old bedsheet over the back seat.
B0007VANJK|5|I installed this on my 2012 Tacoma I picked this over reese because of other reviews that said that all the holes lined up I put it on by myself in my drive way in about an hour no drilling or hammering everything installed very easy & it is rated at more than my truck can tow
B003YO6I7I|5|It matched perffectly!
B001GN0XDO|1|Very bad
B00681BE2S|5|This item is great and cheap. The installation was a little bit confusing, but If you watch youtube you will not have any problem with it.
B0027QWNGO|5|Holds trash about as good as anything
B00A3TYJ0A|5|I like the gloves they are very nice well worth the money I spent
B00755JMYS|4|I purchased these bulbs to replace the stock lights in my car. They look great and work great. Only complaint I have is that they can fall apart easily if moved just wrong. Other than that they are good. Cheap enough to buy more if need be.
B00I4C8L8O|5|Fits like a glove!  :)
B00GNUEKES|5|Had to have this once I saw it! It's on the back window of my new car and I love it! Super fast shipping.
B00A1AX1VE|5|Did some research and this was the best one I found was not disappointed!  Very good buy! Would buy again!
B0075SCD7I|4|The photo doesn't have anything to show the scale of this decal. It is smaller than I thought it would be, but then again I didn't want anything too big for my tiny Fiat window.  I like it.  I posted a photo to better represent the size of the decal.  After posting my photo, I realized that the rose bud part of the decal is missing.  I also put mine on the inside of the window, not outside.  :-/
B001AND0R6|5|Great product! It takes a little elbow grease for fitment but fits great. Great customer service even before product was ordered.
B001N4QY66|5|This rpm meter works great. No problems that I can find. It gives a quick reading and can read from several feet away.
B002630J3M|2|The mounting hole for the top light socket was bigger than my original tail light assembly (2002 Civic SI in case there actually was a design change along the way that I am not aware of) so the existing light socket couldn't be secured in place.  Since I was in a time crunch, I ended up cutting the mount out of my original assembly and gluing it in place on this piece.  Worked fine otherwise, just not the &#34;perfect replacement&#34; it is advertised as.
B0041P1SLU|5|People need to understand this is not a cold air intake. cold air intakes have a divider to divide hot engine air from the out side cooler air. If you are looking for HP gains or better performance you need cooler denser air.
B000E7BBL6|4|It. Is wire what can you say lol
B000C7TUQG|5|Very good.
B0002UENJ2|5|As advertised
B001GH3QSO|3|I installed these on a 2wd 2001 f150. No you dont need a coil compressor. Just lower the lower control arm all the way down. Take the factory rubber bushing off the top of the coil spring and only use tha spacers. Im writing this in hopes to be able to answer questions and help others. These were the questions I had before I decided to buy them. Gave me 2&#34; of lift. Suspension travel was lessend, but not too bad.
B002ZCGS5C|5|very happy with the purchase of the extreme max drivable big wheel snowmobile dolly set. They work great and the price was satisfactory
B000FP8HUU|4|this sandpapar does what it says it will do . I am happy with its proformance . I was not expecting miracles .
B005R3SSMW|4|Good tool for removing the oil filter I like that its metal and not plastic and works good with a 3/8 ratchet
B000BGOI92|5|Quick delivery. Did the trick
B00C5TJ4QA|5|New, as described. Works great.  Quick shipping
B000GZPH2U|5|My hand doesn't get numb as fast. (I have pinched nerves in my elbows). I love the extra width, it's comfortable. I will never go back to being without one, and this one was way more comfortable than my previous chrome grips that had a small version on it designed on the actual grip. Love this cozy product!
B005G5RUK2|3|I ordered these boots to replace a pair of Harley boots that had gotten worn out.  While I like the style, they are very heavy.  I've been wearing them for summer riding and they are just too hot.  Maybe they will do better in cooler weather.<br /><br />After riding all day, I find my feet are tired and sore.  There are a couple of places on the right foot that rub along the top of the boot above the ankle.  A few days' wear seems to have broken them in, though, and the rubbing has stopped.<br /><br />They run true to size.
B000C1OWWY|4|Fit perfectly, easy to install and  generates very low noise and dust levels. I will gladly purchase the same brand for the rear set.
B00XIMJG84|5|It works great!
B0041TQU14|5|was great...great price n easy to put in our car
B0013NJX7Y|3|Well, its bright, easy to install, packaging is not in english, and its plastic.  Hope it holds up to my use!
B00G1XB8RO|5|absolutely the best & easiest to use . awesome !
B009DR5VD2|5|gotta have sticker for any floyd fan looks cool on my automobile window 5 stars i am happy with this purchase see you on the dark side of the moon!
B002UD0GGS|5|Does great cleaning up plexiglass aircraft canopies .
B001MU5LNS|5|Direct fit in my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3
B000X23U98|5|Fit perfectly. I love these mats because they're so durable. You can scrub them or power wash them when they get dirty. Definitely a little pricey but I think it's worth the investment!
B00NYC07A4|5|It did exactly what it advertised - it updated my navigation maps.
B00EHIPQ1E|4|Works great. Very bright
B00KTHYDA2|1|They wont work
B000PC4BAS|1|THIS ITEM DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ROLL PIN. IT IS A POSSIBLE SCAM TO GET MORE MONEY FOR THE ITEM. I HAVE ORDERED 2, THE BOX TO THE 1ST WAS ALL TORN UP AND I THOUGHT THE ROLL PIN HAD FALLEN OUT. THE 2ND WAS PACKAGE PROPERLY, BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ROLL PIN.
B00CJ0AIJM|4|Received a defective, but Amazon had a replacement on my doorstep in just 2 days. Replacement works fine and appears to be decent quality. Would probably buy it again if needed.
B004Y7BHCU|4|Great design and looks great in my car and would look great in other vehicles.  They were made kind of thin but does the job.
B000C5G430|5|fit great
B001447TKU|5|my older 35 horse johnson outboard takes this plug they are hard to find in stores so this was great for me they came right away and i will surely be getting them again best price i ever got for them as well
B0070HJNW2|5|Work And operates excellent
B001F8VFK0|3|I ordered this jacket based on other positive reviews and the fact that the armor appeared to be high quality.  The jacket weighs about 4 lbs and is very thick and would be excellent protection, however I can't wear it.  It's too heavy for me and it runs very small.  I wear a 14/16 but I'm curvy.  I normally wear an XL.  From other jacket websites I knew to order up a size so I ordered XXL.  I can't zip it up.  It would probably be OK for someone with an average or small bust, but I don't recommend it for more curvy types.  If I ordered the XXXL it would be way too big in the shoulder arms and waist and even heavier still.  I felt stifled just standing in my living room at 75 deg F.  I couldn't imagine riding in this when it's over 100.  I think I would pass out.  This is my first experience with a motorcycle jacket so I'm not sure if they are all like this, but it's not what I was expecting.
B00BQA3VD6|5|2 thumbs up
B00142Q3KY|3|I thought they were metal. They are flat plastic black. They are not shiny black like our truck. Now, I am waiting for them to be painted to match, which is rather costly. I hope the paint works for it. The body shop guy seems to think it will.
B0066SI3Z4|5|Have had these on my RR for a couple months now and they still look great. I would recommend using an adhesion promoter so the double sided take sticks better and make sure you clean the surface of the vehicle before installing.
B009AA2FAY|5|This is a very common part to fail on GM trucks.  Dealer wanted over $300 for this part and this one worked great.  Took less than 10 minutes to replace the right on on my 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe.  Airbag light turned off once this was replaced.
B003L31RHI|5|I make a good deal between the filter and the oil. I bought one of the best product in the market for less money than I can find locally.
B003RY53U8|4|Nice mugs
B001XCBCQK|5|Product came quickly and was easy to install. My backseat is missing the head rests, but this still covers the space and my medium sized mixed breed cannot get in the seat with my kids.
B0051D3MP6|5|A great charger!
B0009OMYAQ|5|Nice, cheap tool to remove the oil filter cartridge that the GM Ecotec engine hiding inside my Saab uses.  Reasonable price and good quality.  This the sort of tool that Lisle does best.
B00494P8TG|3|Don't let the name fool you; they're made by communist Chinese.  3 stars are all that this veteran gives Chinese crap.  Otherwise they appear to be of mediocre quality.  The studs are shorter than I'd prefer since I have Weld Racing rims that are about 1/4&#34; thick.  Had I noticed where they were made prior to install I would have returned them.  The first Chinese made product I've installed on my Jeep. It'll be the last from Alloy USA.
B000LHX7RU|1|I buff / wax our vehicles quite frequently and ordered these to try them out.  They were very tight getting on my buffer to begin with and was got a rip before even starting.  I was a little skeptical because they were so rough in texture but tried them out.  Didn't make it half way through before one started coming apart.  Used the second one to finish up and threw them in the trash.  Was hoping to wash and re-use but will buy a higher quality product next time.
B005F1PZGI|5|This one of the best riding gear i have.  The vented fabric of this jersey keeps me cool in hot riding days and the design is awesome.  Just love it!!!  I'd recommend any of Fox 360s .. just choose your favorite color.
B001BC0U0G|5|Was really looking for an 8 ball shift knob. There are plenty out there. Purchase one from American Shifter which was supposed to be a real billiard ball machined with an insert. Was not. It was molded and not even round. Bummer. This was the closest to a black ball I could find. It fits my BMW no problem. I like the heavy feel of it. Easy to install. Looks nice.
B000EDST24|5|this is a wonderful thing for those of us who are not too crazy about the flying marauders invading our space it is easy to install but if your slide is old I recommend getting a new one.
B003WDEYPE|4|I bought this as a spare to keep at my work.  Does a great job and has come in very handy especially when I forget to charge my phone at home.
B00BH0QQVE|4|If u like spending a little money then go ahead. It's ok for my small Kia Forte, I like the fact that it is unique and original. The price is also great.
B000ED09I6|5|Great product, good price, almost perfect direct bolt-on (the tips touch the exhaust shrouds, probably needs some trimming). Hangers all in the correct place, length is just right (tips are an inch or two further out than factory, but that was expected).<br /><br />My package was shipped solely with the catback installation hardware, but not the midpipe hardware (midpipe-manifold gasket, and the three bolts/nuts/washers), which is only a minor issue.<br /><br />If noise is not your thing, this is not the exhaust for you (at least without some silencers). According to the 'Sound Meter' app on my phone, the car is as loud at cold idle now as it was a redline on the full stock system.
B00BERR1EG|5|SUPER EASY TO INSTALL IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES MY MIRROR WAS AS GOOD AS NEW
B004I12S5C|5|OEM Quality and even includes all the bulbs :) Now I need to replace the other side since it's not as nice looking as the new one is lol.
B00GXK1YWY|1|I o sered this cover and they mailed me the wrong cover and wrong size so I returned it and they sent me a new one and it was the wrong size and then I email them which they were slow to get back to me I told me after 2 days of waiting that the product was out of stock and it would be a while so I opted to get my money back I would not recommend this company they take forever to get back to you but the cover on the other hand everyone they sent Me seemed heavy duty I would not recommend this product anyone just because they're bad customer service
B0031HNHQI|4|Purchased a couple of these filters for my 2012 Dodge Avenger R/T.  Easy installation (thanks Fiat), perfect fit.  Some other reviewers have mentioned that their vehicles did not come with a filter installed, guess it did not make it through that QA check.  The filter I replaced at 15K miles was pretty dirty.  Car is used exclusively in and around town and certainly on the highway.  The Purolators are electrostatically charged so I hope it can trap some additional particles, maybe even smaller than the filter media would normally allow.  I will check again at 30K, will see...<br /><br />Price was OK, but the rebates made them a very good deal.  My only reason to deduct a star is because it had to rely on the rebate as a gimmick to sell the filter.  Wish they would just price them more competetively and skip the whole rebate deal altogether.
B000FPDL5Q|1|It was listed as a 6 pack but it was not a six pack.  Could have saved some trouble if it was listed correctly.
B00NQGSHBE|1|First off. Box it came in was crushed. No protective packaging at all. The chrome on it was all broken. The whole piece is brittle to begin with. Ended up not even using it. No instructions and pieces don't fit. Just save your money and buy something else.
B0027ETJ9U|5|price is good and is exactly what I ordered. It appears to be working as advertised but there is no way to really know.
B008QD8XNE|1|I tried to install the rear set and they were slightly to long causing the ventvisor to bow in the middle. I had issues with the front on the passenger side not letting the window to completely close. With some effoet i got the fronts to work, but the rear were to bad to work with. I have installed several sets of visors and this is the first set that has given me issues.
B0009IBJAS|5|i have 3 of these now, and they work great! they have saved my battery lives and saved me money! would definitely recommend everyone to have one if they have a mower, atv, etc that might sit for a few weeks at a time
B0087G189Q|5|I am so glad I purchased this quality tool! I love it, and it is my go-to tool in jewelry making.
B00P9OF04I|5|This stuff is awesome! It comes with a paste, you rub it on with a small disc (think brillo pad texture or synthetic steel wool) you rub it on, it takes minimal effort, and wipe it off. You spray it with the spray and it look a ton better. It is 1000 times better than the sanding and polishing kits and way faster.<br /><br />Over all I would HIGHLY recommend this item, super simple, easy, and effective.
B002ZXHGWK|5|so far so good!
B00QU621MS|5|I bought these for my son, he loves the design on the gloves. They seem pretty durable for his type of riding.
B00CJW32NO|5|Great product
B001IH6VR0|5|Awesome deal and works great!
B00F8LEB9W|1|Try to make it to work so many different times and they never function for my 98 ford f150. I got tired of trying and now is going to cost me more money if I send them back .
B00IB1X6N8|4|These nurf bars are exactly what my girfriend was looking for to easily access her 2012 wrangler. They really dress up the pinch weld and look awesome on the jeep. As said before the instructions can be a little difficult to understand and the pictures are terrible. I highly recommend seperating all parts for each side which really helped for the installation, one thing to note is it was hard to install the rear brackets to the nut bars as there is not two slots like the front. we used a magnet to hold the bars in place while bolting on the brackets. All said and done my girlfriend and i spent around 1 1/2 hours for the complete install. we would recomend these to anyone looking for a nice product at a great price.
B00GRRFLOK|5|Really happy with this item. Great price too.
B001CF4UXU|5|Prefect
B000HZUXNW|5|Small and compact to keep my kids DVDs and misc car items out i<br />Of the way and off the floor.
B00429NKWK|5|Made the headlights look like new.
B001G4Z5J0|4|Seems to be built well, mesh platform seems a little flimsy but I'm not gonna be loading it to its 500lb max anyways. Should work well when traveling with my family. Will update after I use this carrier.
B004ZF3UGW|5|Giving five stars for now because this kit is great. I would reccomend the 55 watt kit over the 35 watt hands down. The 6000k color of these bulbs is the best ive seen. And they are brighter than any other hid kit ive had. Now ive just gotta see how long they last.
B00AC83LPG|5|This is a repeat purchase, very glad to find it. Perfect for saving the used oil until I pour it into old milk jug, take it to Autozone for free recycling. Just the right size for working in my garage. Catches all the drips from the oil drain as well as the filter at the same time.
B000H6W42Y|5|A must have for Ford transmission cooling hoses. 5.4 liter 2003 Expedition
B006SA5GK0|5|Perfect.
B00DBESE64|5|got a pair of these last summer for the DRLs on my tahoe, they put out an even, crisp white light.6 monthes later,  just bought another pair for my reverse lights. when i unlock my tahoe at night, they put out a nice ring of light around my whole truck. highly recommend. the 6 month old pair are just as bright as the new ones.
B000BZN9H0|5|It was so easy to install and it made 2001 Dakota ride so smooth . I am so glad I bought these hubs.
B000JKK2MM|2|This was really a hassle to put together, I had to make two different trips to the hardware store to get different screws. The ones that come with it are all too short! And there were no instructions with it - we had to go online and find them ourselves. This will be the last Smittybilt product we purchase.
B002XWB5MU|5|This touch up gun is great for spraying tanning solutions. Cheap and easy to use. Clean up is easy also. I had never used a spray gun, but one trip to youtube showed plenty of tutorial videos.
B005FM0X3W|5|NO GMC logo on Grille, feels slightly cheaper than an OEM but cant beat it for the price
B00KTHXRLS|4|Great.. works!! A little &#34;sensitive&#34; as some others have reported, but it &#34;gets the job done&#34;!!
B000CMH1WQ|5|Just what I wanted!
B00K5V8OPC|5|awesome decal for any photo lover.
B00IZJS992|5|love them..really cool looking looks great on my license plates
B008OM1BG8|5|Looks great works great can't beat it u will need basic tools and how to wire stuff up
B000BOAX1G|5|Very good. I have had them on for approximately two months with no problem. I would recommend them to a friend
B0026L2M0C|4|Well, I dont use this product as my regular fluid although it is a very good product -not the reference recommended for my model-, but as it is cheaper and good quality, I use it to flush the system.
B000KOTY3K|4|Nice heavy fender. Allowed me to weld these in place rather than using brackets. Good heavy duty fender that I can actually sit on. Sure beats plastic!
B001AWDPD6|5|Quality was outstanding and the fit was perfect. Took about 45 minutes to install and we were back on the trail !!
B0051MYLS4|3|Not to happy with it while having bmw M parralell wheels. can't really get in between the spokes
B00JI65TJO|5|Looks good. It arrived ahead of schedule.
B000JI93GK|5|Excellent quality and product
B002UC6WY4|5|worked great.
B000EQRMTC|5|Replaced the shoes and drums on my 1999 Protege at the same time; these worked perfectly with the drums I picked up here on Amazon.
B0083H4SMI|1|Worked for about 2 months and quit.  Save your money and buy the OEM switch instead, and you'll be done with it.
B000GD3S1O|4|This was a cute gift.  I expected it to be larger but probably the dimensions were shown on the description.
B0007M30BC|5|exact thing i need very good quality and a good price
B000CO9MF8|4|thethe clamp seems compact and suitable for most tailpipes.<br /><br />The finish looks good but not sure about the silver coating if it could last.  The clamp came in a clear bag and a shipping box.  Not packaged in  a manufacturer box.  Not sure if it had any.<br /><br />I recommend adding a jamnut to the threads when locking the clamp to the pipe.  It might unscrew itself with the exhaust vibrations.
B00LMZK1MY|1|I did not serve my car
B006OQ3NMQ|5|Easy swap and install with an older faucet.  Appears to be solid construction.  Has an aerator attached and comes with a screw on hose adapter that replaces the aerator.
B00G71JTUS|5|Cannot match the quality of this badge/emblem!
B00F7HD6BQ|3|The color rubs off on these fairly quickly. They look great when first applied but I would not be ordering again.
B003SJHQ2U|4|Bought this module after the pulse settings went out in my 2001 Sierra 1500.  I was very excited to have more than just on/off settings again.  The only complaint I have is that if you switch from high speed down to one of the first settings too quickly, the wipers will stop in the middle of the motion.  If you are like me and just need a cheap alternate to a new motor to get  your wipers working, this will do the trick.  I would order again.
B004HJAS7K|5|Love love this new wheel cover.. since I had the seat covers, it really dresses up my car now.. It was a smidge hard to slip on , but once on , fits great.
B001PYLFDG|5|There is enough hardware to do both sides
B000EPPARY|5|have used these type of sleeves for a lot of years, they do a great job and save a lot of money.  use them, you will be glad you did.
B000CIZZXC|5|This item did not fit my truck, but looked great, was packaged good, got to me fast, and had a hassle free return.
B001HRJ7MM|4|Note before you read my review, this review is based on my experience of finding, buying, and seeing this oil gasket, I have yet to put this gasket on my 944, but seeing as there were no reviews, I wanted to write one to help out people that were in a similar position as me.<br /><br />Now, first thing is first, I have a Porsche 1986 944 N/A, and if you need a oil gasket, buy this one immediately, it shipped for me Prime, and it was only 47.50, the cheapest I found (on ebay, USED) was about 60 bucks, and this one is brand new, and yes, it is for a 944, and yes, your oil pan is really that big, the thing holds 6 quarts of oil. But be warned, I have been preparing and doing my homework for this job, and it is a huge undertaking, because there is a bar, (I forget what it is called, still learning about my 944) that is directly underneath the oil pan, that has to come off, and that bar helps hold together the front suspension, along with the engine, so if you are going to do this job you will need some way to hold the engine up, honestly if you do not have access to a shop with a lift, this job is going to be an enormous pain in the butt, not to mention you have to take off the drive train in order to take off the oil pan as well, just google replacing the oil pan, and you will find plenty of walk throughs for it, but remember, there is over 20 bolts holding the oil pan on, it MUST be tightened in the correct pattern, with the correct torque weight, OR IT WILL LEAK! Remember, this is a performance car, so it must be near perfect, it's not some econ car that you can cut corners and do a crappy job.
B006RL3KH6|3|Kind of expensive for the quality.... I made it work, but some of the little elastic cords are sticking out and the holes for the buckles weren't a correct fit. Wouldn't buy again, but w/e.
B000E81VN8|5|This trunk organizer works great. I have a Cadillac SRX and it fits perfectly in the trunk space.  It also has a slip resistant bottom so it doesn't slide all over the trunk.  The different compartments allow for adjustments depending on what you want to carry in it.
B000CB7DNE|5|this filter filters things. I don't have any sort of filter calibrator so i don't know how well it works but i do know that it fits in my 2001 eurovan and that the old one needed to be replaced.
B00J0BYLDW|5|I'm a big fan of jimmy buffet this is great for my jeep and fits tight I bought the cover lock  to go with it
B0018EW91A|4|fits nice on windshield and looks good.<br />my amp for radio and wires fit nice in side of bag.<br />bag was a little tight at first but stretched out and works well.
B000C5YD0Q|1|Purchased this oxygen sensor for my 2004 Mitsubishi Galant V6. I purchased either in June or July 2014 by the middle of August 2014  my ses light came back on. Took my car back to my mechanic and this part is now failing. If ordering this part, be advised it cannot be returned to this seller nor is it covered by Denso's manufacturer warranty (I called Denso).
B001J83FKE|5|Arrived on time. Work very well. Thanks.
B00TEHDIK4|5|As advertised
B003IOKPLO|5|A real gem
B00BYHFU3U|5|Fits great
B000VYF0NW|4|OK
B00CKTO1B8|5|Awesome product!
B000BUQOFO|5|They work great.  Much easier then the building block levelers I used to use.
B00496MAWC|5|A great product at an excellent price
B000182DPG|2|I bought this product for my 2005 Infiniti. From my previous experience with changing air filters on other cars (with regular paper filter replacements), I was expecting a MAJOR improvement on my MPG as well as the overall &#34;Zippiness&#34; of my SUV with this K&N filter.<br />Although the installation was very easy, the MPG has actually gotten worst by a few miles and I don't really notice an increase in the power output.<br />Summary: I had better MPG and similar Power with regular paper air filters so far...I will provide an update if things change somehow
B008KSI6H8|5|The switch arrived on time and in good condition. Installation was simple, the unit fit like the original part and to date the switch is working well.
B00JG3OIFU|5|This product has a lot of 5 star reviews for good reason, and that's why I decided to try it. I used it on my tires and black trim, with excellent results. It is necessary to wipe off/buff the residue to achieve proper bonding and full protection the directions say. I like that the sheen is more of a satin rather than gloss. This stuff is more expensive than the others, but that's because it works better. I used a foam pad to apply and an old (not dirty, just one I could throw away) cotton towel to wipe off and buff. Highly recommended.
B008NE8J0I|4|Fit perfect on my remote for my 2014 Ford Escape. Only drawback to soft rubber is it attacts all dust and lint. But it's doing a great job protecting my fob!
B00DIHUGY2|5|Met expectations
B00W68A9K0|1|terrible looking....not anything that the supplier is advertising....you can see what works he did on them very clearly and cheap quality involved
B008VQRNJG|5|I bought 2 of these and installed them on a 2006 Corolla LE before a road trip. It was a good thing i did. made the car handle better since the old ones were real worn. Looks like they are very well made. Made my car way more steady down the road. Couldn't ask for more.
B000LY9EGG|5|Fast Delivery Service. I ordered them on 5/12/09 and received notification the estimated delivery date was 5/27/09, I actually received them on 5/19/09. I downloaded the instructions from the internet, but the instructions in the box were different and the ones to use. My husband put them on my 2008 Chevy Silverado crew-cab in what seemed like no time. Customer service was great also.
B00BUSIKQ2|5|Works just advertised....hold items snug and well. Really looks to be a durable product that will last a long  time.
B001GPX3P2|5|absolutly great this is a great cover especially when u live in a one plate state this is a god feeatuer
B001S21LJ8|5|Great product.<br />Thanks
B002MYG8L2|5|Fit perfectly.  All necessary parts were supplied.
B001RNOHBC|4|This is a real value for the money.  This is the same price as most power inverters that don't come close to 400 watts of power.  Cobra products have always proved dependable for me.
B004TZNS3S|4|I have placed this on my rear window of my truck for all to see.  good representation of the Blue Lodge.
B001J4L5QY|5|I HAVE HAD OTHER COVERS IN THE PAST AND I MUST SAY I .... THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!!!  THIS WILL BE A MUST FOR ANY TRUCK I BUY IN THE FUTURE... GREAT PRICE, EASY TO USE, KEEPS OUT WATER, ETC ETC
B001G7EB42|2|Great price,  doesn't fit my volvo like it says it should. Like another guy said,  had to wrap duct tape around it then press it in.  Made it work,  better than the broken one but certainly not right.
B007Y87T1O|5|it worked very well.
B000CITK8S|5|I bought one recently to replace a misplaced one i used to have. So there's no surprise I'm pleased with the product. Love the ease of use, and low price.
B00NAC3W1E|4|IT'S OK. TOO BAD IT  DIDN'T HAVE A RUBBER INSERT WITH A COMPRESSION FIT. THE PLASTIC SQUARE THAT GOES INTO THE RECEIVER IS A BIT RINKY DINK. OVERALL, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
B000BZZQ80|5|Inexpensive but quality replacement rotor for Corvette C5 including Z06. I use them on my race car, easy bedding process and consistent reliability for a great price.
B005ZZH7G0|3|These Mudguards look to be a good product that should have fit on my Toyota Tacoma Base.  The problem is that the base Tacoma has 15 inch wheels and the lable on the box the mudguards came in says that they are not for 15 inch wheels.
B0088BX0IM|4|Good, but plastic, easy install.
B0031I3TNI|5|It was one connection on my Tail light that would not come on. I went to the junk yards to try and locate the light with no luck. I saw this seller and the price was awesome whole tail light assembly with the bulbs could not find a better price. Received the Product in two days very fast shipping just as described went out replaced the light less than 5 minutes. and just like new the lights all work. Thank You for your excellent service and look forward to doing business for any future needs. Thanks Again.
B003EP14FS|4|These are very nice. They fit nice on my jeep, and didn't take long to do. Maybe two hours. The only thing I didn't like and the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it's made in China, and not in the USA.
B00DJ7OVG0|5|Works well, decent quality
B00MQ33GIM|4|Padded and the magnets work well.  I have a 2014 Yamaha Raider (1900 cc) and the phone never came off the tank.  A couple of things for people to remember which I think are issues but not flaws in the actual case.  Glare on this thing during a sunny day is ridiculous!  You can't read anything.  Also, your iPhone will go to sleep mode and there is no way to open the case while on the bike to push the button.  Thus, you have to change the settings on your phone to not go into sleep mode.  This is a good option to simply hold your phone or use it as night (if you want to use Google MAPS or something).  Construction of the case seems fine but some of the stitching has fallen out.  Nothing major, just doesn't seem quality (but not bad...considering I still gave it 4 stars).  If you get this for under $30 then it may be worth it.  You can't put a wallet and a phone in it together.  You could put cards, cash and a phone (no wallet).  Hope this helps for those on the fence.  Glare is brutal during a sunny day!!!
B00AMLQ6C8|5|I ordered the Westin Product over the others available on the market due to brand recognition.  My package was delivered to the door days earlier than expected.  First chance I got I started putting them on my truck.  Most aftermarket items require extra time or parts or something that doesn't go right...that's what I was expecting.  The installation took all of an hour or so and was very straight forward.  Looks great, rock solid, and easy to install...what more can you say.
B001KQ43SI|5|This product worked really well.  It installed easily and had excellent quality. The motor is strong and fast. Recommend it.
B007Y3BKNC|5|The product arrived as promised and I couldn't be more pleased.  These are good little switches that light up nice and feel good to use.  They have a nice positive click and seem to be a great value.
B000EQR7XS|4|Fits my 2009 Chevy Malibu, didn't fix my engine light but another code could have came up since the last time I had it read. Otherwise this is quality and not a bad price compared to what you would get at Walmart
B002ANVF5E|5|Painted my whole truck with it I loved it so much!
B000ARKIA0|5|Works great and does not appear to scratch the finish on the car.
B000EJQJ1G|5|Great Charger!
B0070Y34UW|5|Arrived much sooner than predicted.  Installed one strip inside instrument cluster above speedometer.  Very bright, works with instrument dimmer switch.  Previously had purchased led instrument bulb kit from national supplier that only produced 1/10th the brightness.  Did not use the self adhesive strip .
B006QKC182|5|The hitch is as advertised and installed quickly and easily.  It arrived quickly and was very well-packaged.  I rate this an excellent purchase.
B009PAK75E|4|Nice , fit description . Just had to do a few adjustments .
B001EOV492|5|great
B0012RJZT2|5|easy to install
B000CSGWZC|5|Iridium plugs are worth the few extra dollars.  They last longer and perform better!    They have also been known to to eliminate low-end stumbles, deacceleration backfires, and similar issues.    Current price at Amazon (with free shipping) is cheaper than my local motorcycle shop and also cheaper than Bike Bandit.
B003DQQFN4|5|The product was received fast in an very good condition.  Better than I expected.
B007QHQB3U|5|Better than stock, takes all my strength to close the gate, love it!!
B005EKY1EM|5|Works great on my agm battery.
B00C63K9WS|5|THANKS !
B004MMTO6I|5|Works well to make the Rugged Ridge aftermarket seat function like OEM.  Installation was easy. Recommended. Would buy again. a
B00BYH6C1E|5|just kidding....but really, I was having to look for my husband's cell phone on a weekly basis.  It is black and hid really well down that crack between the seat and the console.  Problem Solved!  Wonderful invention.
B00MV9OBE4|5|Fit perfectly and matches
B00586LINE|3|The dont' look great will do the job, A little pain to remove and replace, But worth the Price<br />I would recommend for someone that doesn't want Permenent bars up.
B004DGCY6A|5|High quality sticker, not too big, great colors and attention to detail. Easy to adhere to an automobile window. Recommended.
B0031IMRH2|5|perfect fit!
B00BNORY60|1|It was too small for a laptop and I should have paid better attention to its size. He uses it for important papers for class. It does fit our tablet but my goal was a sleeve for the laptop.  The MINI MOUSE has received MANY MANY compliments.
B001MUGTUW|1|The material is a thin, cheap, satin-like material and the steering wheel cover does not match the picture online. The picture online shows two sets of hearts, one at the top and one toward the bottom of the seat covers. However the set I received just has the set of hearts at the top on the seat covers.  I'm very disappointed in this order.  The floor mats are the only thing that matched the picture online.
B00K180146|2|Not anodized. Very thin paint. Chips very easy
B00D2OHWVG|5|Works wonderfully!  This is the best price we found anywhere and it outperforms the lights found at our local hardware store.
B004JCIHDW|5|My 2 yo grandson helped that's how easy the install was.  Even empty, the ride on my F-150 was vastly improved
B000KU74MM|5|Everything about this purchase was awesome!
B004UM7MDC|4|its a sturdy plate frame. has a nice curved pocket to slide your plate in.the price could have been better.
B004KV4DN0|5|I use it for my aquarium.  I use it in the kitchen.  I take it to the hot springs.  I use it on the ESC's of my RC/FPV planes.<br /><br />I use this for everything.  I use it a lot.<br /><br />I find this product to be a great value for the money and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.
B000TM7HXC|5|THANKS
B000KL72XW|1|be careful...<br />amazon's website says item will fit my specific make and model, however it does not!  this is the 2nd time for the item.<br />so i went directly to the mfg. site and got the correct part number and yes, amazon does have that part too.  but still shows the item i rcvd. will work...<br />i just checked the front liners, same issue; its not the same part number approved by the mfg. specs.<br /><br />items they say will fit, do not!
B0010DZZSI|4|I like the idea of carbon and baking soda for pulling odors out of the air.  Works just as expected and a good value buying it here.
B006WHEBGE|5|It works well, and solved my problem with low idle and stalling.
B00429YAA6|1|They do not fit my seats and I'd like to return them.<br /><br />I have a Volvo V70 wagon and they do not fit, they are WAY too small.
B004YEJ7KC|5|Very pleased with this product
B001DRP9E6|4|Fast delivery, item as described!
B003JTYGPO|5|Works great, easy to use, does the job every other tank full of gasoline. I keep a store of them in the trunk.
B003LLRZLC|5|works greaT, THANKS
B00EC840NE|5|Great quality. Excellent fit in a 2015 Grand Cherokee.
B0030D0T2S|4|Im sure the cable works good but i havent tried it to jumpstart a car. It says it handles up tp V8 cars. The thing i dont like is that it feels loose and cheap on the contact ends they might break
B000C9TBGI|5|Received the filter in manufacturer packaging.  Consulted google and the Chilton manual to ensure proper removal and replacement of the existing filter with the new one.  Went in with no problems and my minivan has had no issues.  Photos of the filter prior to install have also been uploaded.
B003R2YLLC|5|I've tried the others and this one is the best. It fits the total windshield area and is a much better at keeping the temperature down.<br /><br />Cheers....D.D South Carolina
B007RYV89O|5|This is a pretty slick trick, and pretty easy to accomplish once you get the hang of it. Here's a tip: hold the chain so that you look through the loop at the person you are performing the trick for. There is a youtube video that helps teach you how to hold the ring before you let go.
B00GBQ5U1G|5|Very nice
B008G26UBM|5|excellent
B00AM4FRX4|2|The filter was a little loose, does not fit snug as an OEM filter.  Also the gasket around frame easily slides off making it frustrating to ensure it's properly aligned when snapping the air box closed.  Never had this issue with other filters from this manufacture, not sure it's unique to this model only, but I will buy the Acura/Honda filter going forward.
B002JH7PEQ|1|It stopped working after a short time.  I also had trouble keeping the plug in, it kept popping out.  It is probably cheaply made.
B00CXW0VIY|4|This thing is really nice to use.  I don't have to drag around a power cord.  I bought it because I just purchased a mid-size SUV and I need a step stool to do the roof.  This buffer make it so much easier.  I just wish that the seller had extra batteries.
B00MHDL0O8|5|It's fine- it is $10 and looks good and works good
B0002SR7TC|4|Good product, everything worked as advertised. instructions are poorly written.
B002J8LMVC|4|This is a straight-forward, no nonsense, jumper battery. The shape is easy to store. It seems to have plenty of power. I miss a feature that my last jumper battery had and that is a light that says you are connected. Nevertheless I expect to use this for a number of years.
B000K6INOO|5|Used this in the upper electronics box for a non-marine stereo.  Worked great.  No suggestions for improvement.  Lots of mounting angle options.
B009STHA5W|5|Perfect fit
B008L12ECW|5|My tractor is better than before
B003TSYIGC|4|Item arrived fuel vapor valve fit from original to new tank, however the original sending unit is too tall in height for the new tank and now I am currently looking for a different sending unit.  The inlet pipes are smooth Measure your sending unit first, because the supplier is basing this on the year of vehicle I have a 91, with import thanks for the help.
B00D8WHJEW|5|I love this product works better than your average tow rope in my personal opinion.
B00332LUTW|5|I love my camaro SS license plate frame it is a pretty black and the SS is in red. Thanks amazon for another great product!
B008SCWXN4|5|Do my own summer-winter tire swaps now because shops seem to charge quite a bit for TPMS reset, which now takes me literally two minutes with the ATEQuickset.  Easy to use, good online video instructions.  Nice not being dependent on someone else. Be sure to photograph or record any new TPMS sensor id's when you buy them so that you can program into the software.
B00CTGM1G4|5|Good PArt for replacement, looks good. fits good. oem part good color match no issues with install new part. great
B004SL0IW2|5|Excellent braking and less dust.
B005E3CZP6|5|The guage covers got here within two days & they were very easy to install. It took no time to put it in & while it made a difference in the daylight, the difference at night was absolutely beautiful! A friend's husband ordered this one through my account for her Mustang, which is a vibrant blue on the exterior with some white striping. These glow guages really show it off at twilight & at night. I've driven the car before & after & these guages are awesome, especially with the blue exterior. I'm seriously contemplating checking to see if the seller has the same kit for my '94 Camaro, which is Viper Blue & should have about the same effect. I never would've thought it would make as big of a difference as it does & my husband has offered to do this for my car since we bought it about 6 years ago & I always said no because I didn't think I'd like it. Well, I've changed my mind. It just took me having to see it for myself, I guess, & the price was quite reasonable compared to the prices I've seen in the past. I definitely recommend the part as well as the seller, who was very easy to work with. The only way this product could really be much better would be if it glowed purple or lavender =-)
B0002TDUW4|5|The best strong paint #1
B00E975T74|5|Great product! Stays on untill you want it off perfect for a little change, very happy with how it came out my rims look awesome. Super easy !
B0012TRLWS|3|to small its ok keeps fallen to my neck and plus ur neck it cold from the wind as it dont cover that lo
B00BEN8B0S|4|this was a good sticker it just didnt have the white border around the original black. its just straight all black. but otherwise it would have been a good sticker. i say this because my car is 5% tint and you couldnt see it but if the white was inbetween the black it would have been 5 star worthy.
B006TMRAS8|4|good stuff
B0002V9LAW|5|I have used this before and it works great . I use it on my stainless steel sink and it comes out great . It also does a great job on the brass poles on the outside of my building. It lasts longer than other polishes
B00NT5VDZ4|5|Awesome!!
B0027G2U0I|5|great and light
B007JSGR9Y|1|it does not work  ITS not talking to my car  and my car is obd-II compliant
B00480J4UK|1|bright but do not illuminate very far (what they are supposed to do).
B00IEY7TZ8|1|The visor all plastic and the instructions all in a foreign language: I knew I could break it by doing the wrong thing, so I sent it back.
B000SL4AA2|4|Excellent value.  Easy to use. Just plug it in your car lighter and off it goes.  Good for bike tires and lawn mower tires also.
B000ES867C|5|Liked it so much I am going to order another one for my other rock crawler. I would recommend that if you really want them for night wheeling you should order 2 kits.
B005DXNKU6|3|Pros.  Arrived quickly. fair quality. Sturdy.  Welds are holding up well after rough use.<br /><br />Cons: Universal mounting hardware did not work with my 2012 Honda Rancher.  Had to buy U-bolts at local hardware store.  Have noticed some rust showing after several months use (and I live in the dry desert).
B00AU4F74K|1|Your advertising of the product was misleading.  In the photos showing the camera, the monitor was included.
B00FPJJ85Y|5|If i had a car I'd buy this/
B000E1DT6C|5|Well I think I love it is a bit overstated but it did not cost much,  seems to be constructed well enough that it will last a good while and it fits on the ball snugly enough that it will only come off when you physically take it off.  Nothing fancy but very utilitarian at a price you cannot beat.
B004VRRMMC|3|The plates fit great, everything fit like it was supposed to. But I did not receive the bolts needed to bolt the bed rails to the new plate. Luckily I had my old ones from my old truck.
B0083W18IU|5|Worked, had to drill choke cable adjuster so choke cable would fit it
B004WO9T0C|5|I have a set of these on my Ram.  The rear shocks provide no lift.  However, they do provide excellent suspension and ride comfort characteristics.  A worthy upgrade over stock.  Probably the last shocks the truck will ever see!
B00GIZZGLO|5|perfect fit.  i think this one is better than the original.  $20 seemed a bit high but had to have it.  would have replaced both had they not been $20 each.
B000E28C8G|1|No it leaks had to buy one from the store it was a waste of my money
B000U048YO|5|These are exactly as described - silver when off, and a dark amber when on.  If you're wondering if they'll look good on your car - they will.
B00C5RBRA8|5|this is a great kit, it forms well and seals great for storage, I like it much more than the old flimsy hose
B001O7PNNM|5|Worth every penny. Excellent product
B00H25LVGI|5|Worth price not to visible in sunlight
B0034ZYE5U|5|I use this to haul a 2700 lb race car into an enclosed trailer. The trailer has ramps inside and the winch has to haul the car up the ramps and over the interior trailer fenders. It handles this fine. Additionally, it doesn't sound like it's going to explode while being used like the cheap winches do.
B00387A6TC|1|I bought this jack bed with the intention to use it to lift my 2011 BMW.  However, it tore on the first use, and is not very strong.
B00B17E0SE|5|Perfect fit
B001LQMX3Y|5|Good
B000E4B7GS|5|You just don't want to spend a fortune repairing a 15 year-old car. On the other hand, a perfectly functional car shouldn't just be tossed to the side for easily repaired problems.<br /><br />This mirror fit the bill for me. My wife had broken the old mirror, but Ford wanted $400 to replace it--and that didn't include painting it. I looked here on Amazon, saw this, ordered, and had my next door neighbor install it for $50. He was happy, I was happy, and my wife was very happy.<br /><br />It works fine. What else matters?
B004EC5NF2|5|This cover works great for my camper, 1st winter I used it. Has held up to high winds and lots of ice and snow. Came with gutter/corner guards, and extra fabric to protect other areas. I really like that you can unzip the cover in certain areas such as the door to gain access with removing the whole cover. You can also access front storage compartments without taking anything apart.
B001O039US|5|Worked perfectly. Great deal also. Went to the Chevy dealer and they wanted 92 dollars plus tax. Obviously I went with the better choice.
B0041TR892|5|Easy to replace and much lower cost than those from Hyundai. No one notices the black color.
B004LYNXTG|5|I love these mask I wear it where i work and its negative 10 in the freezer. Feels great on my face, wind resistant, and very warm. Not to mention these things are cheap i might just buy me a few more. Shipping was great no issues, would recommend this product.
B007RRTS1Q|5|Just what I needed.  I purchased some new tail lights for my 2002 maxima not realizing the red L.E.D bulbs I ordered would not be sufficient for (can't tell much difference between running time and actual brakes being pressed).  Got these and they are beautiful through the clear lens.
B007TG7HVI|5|Best wiper blades on the market period. Bought the 21\\" and the 19\\" for my 2005 Honda Civic EX Coupe. They are a perfect fit. It was actually harder to get the old worn blades out than put in the new ones. These are phenomenal and they wipe away smoothly with no sound. I will always buy Bosch wiper blades from now on. By the way, I used this website to determine which sizes I needed for my car make and year - [...]<br />Be aware that Amazon's automatic \\"Check Fit\\" option is INCORRECT at least for my vehicle. When you highlight the 21\\" and the 19\\" it says it DOES NOT FIT your 05 Civic which is incorrect. IT DOES fit on your 05 Civic Coupe EX.
B00AN5TTKE|3|Other than having a decent grip, the first rain it started rusting.
B001JYBT8I|4|Overall this is a good kit. I confess that when I first found this, I went over to my local hardware store just to see about buying all the parts to do this myself.  I quickly realized that there were two problems to this approach.  First, the metal that I could locally was either too big to do any good in protecting the radiator from larger debris or too small to allow a reasonable amount of air to pass through.  Second, the parts and pieces I did find quickly put me up around $30-33 for all the pieces and that still left me having to spend time using primer and spray gloss on the metal mesh that I had found.  For a few bucks more you can get this kit and all the work is done for you.  So overall, this is a good value and avoids a lot of time trying to fabricate something that probably would not end up looking as good.<br />I only knock off 1 star because I think glue should be included.  It took me a while to track down a suitable plastic adhesive that could handle heat and moisture but still remain flexible. I was not confident in using just the adhesive foam mounts as I've had those come loose on me in other applications. I'd prefer they just include a tiny tube of the appropriate adhesive inside the kit which would have saved me the time.<br />I included some install pictures.  One tip I found is that you should start with all the zip ties loose, only just barely engaged.  Then slowly tighten them working from one grill piece to the next. This really helps keep them lined up and evenly spaced across the whole grill. I tightened some of them too quickly and ended up removing some zip ties and redoing them because it pulled the next grill too far to one side.  My kit included some extra adhesive mounts, so I put those on the outside ends.  I also had extra zip ties which I added between grill pieces as extra insurance should something come loose.<br />My only long term concern is the durability of the zip ties.  I know they are not going to last forever, but thegood news is that they are behind the grill entirely so they are protected from the harshest of UV radiation which is the most likely thing to damage them.  Luckily the grill only takes a couple of minutes to remove. I was very surprised how easy it was.  So I really don't mind if sometime in the future it requires a little repair effort on my part.<br />This is a great alternative to some of the insanely priced grill kits.  It would be a 5 star item if they just threw in that little tube of glue.
B000CEZRKM|1|Unlike the others, these fit my 2005 ML500, but the wiping quality was terrible. Streaking right out of the box. Maybe they were old stock, I don't know. But it was bad enough that I threw them in the trash and purchased new blades from the dealer - those worked properly.
B000EZICII|5|I love washing my car and driving a clean shinny car. As to rate it, the only thing I can say about products like this is; if it does what you bought it to do then Money well spent.
B007JMOTJK|3|Quick delivery.  Quality material and good correct size as described.  The elastic band around the opening is not very strong.  A draw string would be better.  I'll put one on to keep debris out.  But good for the price.  I bought two and I'm glad.
B007OWGA4C|1|great seller sucky product
B008K5F5HU|5|This cover is easy to install and looks amazing.  It comes with all necessary hardware needed for installation.  Highly recommend.
B000WEMH4G|5|Great
B00KF9180W|5|Very happy with product. I've worn it for 2 weeks now trail riding on ATVS lots of dust and debris. Thanks to these I wasn't eating any dust and when I took it off I was dust free with a clean face. Can't beat the quality and price. I highly recommend!
B005N9A3ZU|4|I really like this product. It performs well, and there is a noticeable improvement in the wind noise. They hold solid and have not slipped once. However, I'm not a big fan of Thule's assembly instructions, which are in pictograms only and had a tendency to be really confusing. And, there were no words anywhere to verify that you understood correctly. Since this was a little more complex than just mounting a box to them (for which the pictograms work well), I looked up assembly and installation instructions on YouTube to ensure I was doing it right (a few of the steps I would have never guessed right). The instructions are the only reason this product didn't get 5 stars from me, but the problem can be remedied by YouTube. Otherwise, a great product!
B000NW4PQA|5|We live on a very fixed income & no way could we take our vehicle to the garage, quoted us almost 600 dollars for 4 fuel injectors replacement & labor!!!!!!! These fuel injectors are the same as the companys use only cheaper in price!!!!! Husband & brother installed in less than 2hrs & vehicle purrs like a kitten!!!!!!! Thank u so much for selling Quality Parts for a fraction of the cost!!!!!!! U just dont know how thankful we r, God Bless yuns!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000NCOKQK|5|it works like its supposed to. battery took couple of days to fully charge but it works just fine. simple to use
B004M3F4IE|1|Just get the whole kit!! This does nothing on its own! You will thank me for this! Very unhappy with this pen..
B001UFXTG6|5|Bought theses and am very pleased with them. Easy to install. Helped with the heavy loads I put on my 10 Chevy 4X4. Didn't hurt the empty ride of the truck. No rattling noise when empty. Well worth the investment.
B00FJF0O2K|4|I was skeptical, but desperate. I had removed the decals from my motorhome but the seemingly permanent adhesive remained. I tried a bunch of removers that barely touched the task. The Whizzy Wheel did work, kinda like a giant eraser on a drill. The torque from the drill was tiring, but easier than the elbow grease process.
B000A8MIE8|5|The price is rite
B0051RI0G8|3|This is okay for the price.  This muffler does not fit a 1999 - 2005 Miata as it is represented.  The position of the flange that mounts to the factory exhaust is off approximately 2 inches.  The seller required that I pay the shipping to have it returned.  It was cheaper for me to take it to a muffler shop and have it installed which required the flange to be cut off of the muffler and repositioned to match the factory flange.
B00IELPGGU|5|Nice quality, fast shipping, perfect fit.  Was a must when I ordered new rims and tires for my lifted ezgo.  The new tires were hitting the tiered ends.
B001DRP9EQ|1|Wrong part was shipped for my vehicle and the return date is past.  I need to receive the correct part to complete the transmission rebuild project.  Now what?
B006OUNKIY|5|I bought this filter as a replacement for another brand of filter that I had used before.  The filter material seems to be of better quality than the other one.  It seems thicker and the pleats are more consistently sized.  I would buy this again.
B002R1ASKM|5|i like thes it is as show in the picture<br />it is great items as i thought i will fix it in my car
B00LPIA3T4|5|Cheap and excellent.  Works well.
B000H6P55W|5|I was worried I would not have sufficient storage driving from AZ to CA (400 miles), but this was actually larger than would fit between the roof rack of our 2005 Subaru Forester.  I was able to use it without a problem, however, by just by folding the excess vinyl under the straps and pulling all the straps tight.  It kept everything completely dry through a heavy rain storm.  Works as advertised.
B002AMAXNA|5|Why do without it?  it is solid - and what if?  I have not had to use it yet but if it saves my life, I will revise this review!
B005C91D7S|5|all my door locks went bad so I had to unlock it with my key. Toyota dealership quoted me $2,100 out the door. I found these wasted $550 ( for all 4 ) and wasted about 20min per door. And now we're good no issues at all easy swap
B00JV765NY|5|Looks great on my 2004 avalanche, needs the LED relay to solve the hyper flash problem but that's not this sellers problem so 5 stars
B001RNOHBC|5|Purchased a more expensive inverter that did not work, returned and purchased this. worked perfectly out of the box and has continued to work through freezing cold/hot conditions. the dual connections also make it great for traveling/temp mounting in an additional car.
B0052UB5DY|5|AWESOME, worked great! Easy to program, took a few tries to get the timing right, but still, very easy. Mine included a battery, ready to go.<br /><br />Update: 7/7/15<br />Still working. I dropped pretty hard it, actually it was one of those weird moments where somehow I flung it and I thought it was smashed and broken, but it just chipped a corner off, it still functions so it's tough.  I happy with this purchase.
B001Q4VILY|5|it does exactly what i need it to do. I just wish the neck was a little longer, but functions well otherwise
B008EEYUXM|5|so far so good. all looked solid. Timing belt wasn't made in Japan or USA but other than it all worked out good.
B000VKRQA6|5|Works great on my 2002 Acura Cl Type S
B00CMEY14I|5|Fits my kids good. They like the style of the helmet and the gloves. The googles I have mixed feelings on, they are not comfortable for my kids but that is not the reason I bought this helmet.
B0085XH58O|5|Great
B00E88KCZS|4|Great look,little work to make fit.
B005F1QN1Y|5|perfect fit and affordable easy installation i love it made running boards look classy i recommend this product fast delivery
B002BODSUC|5|Excelente
B000E8T83S|5|I use Purolator PureONE Filters on both of my vehicles. Never had problems with this filter. The paint texture on the filter body makes installation easier. The color makes them easy to see in those \\"hide-away\\" locations on newer cars and trucks. The anti-drain down valve keeps oil in the engine lubrication system, no matter how long a vehicle sits between uses - very important to avoid \\"dry-starts\\". The by-pass valve works great for those cold winter-morning starts here in Maine !!<br /><br />Still a great product for the money. There may be more expensive filters - but none better! A filter you can still trust.
B006M9VIRM|5|These are really well engineered and well constructed.  Work extremely well but assembly requires tools and mechanical skills in spite of instructions.  I had to take them all apart twice to cut an additional inch off the top of the flap so they wouldn't drag when I drove my Suburban into a driveway,  I will suggest to this great manufacturer that they provide a chart for cutting based on vehicle and drop when trailer added.  My comments are just suggestions for install suggestions,  I love these and can't imagine a better product for the purpose and ease of use while doing your trailering only.  Slick idea to have entire assembly carried on your receiver.
B002A2L5K0|5|One of my favorite key chains!
B007RRMVA6|5|Seems to match well with 2015 Honda CR-V Alabaster Silver Metallic
B000G01288|5|Great item and fast shipping.
B002OUQI3W|3|SAD TO SAY THE TR 34590 UNIVERSAL LOCK DOES NOT FIT ON A PROGRESSIVE INDUSTRY PT30C 30 AMP ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. HAD TO SEND IT BACK.
B00B3XUBES|2|Followed instructions to a tee. Removed some but not all odor(skunk). Too expensive for the results achieved . Would not recommend.
B002T1C74A|3|It took me an entire afternoon to get this fitted on my bike. Granted a Burgman's handlebars are difficult because they are molded plastic, not bare tubes. And the plastic mounting ring will crack if you tighten it too much. It has 3 different sizes of hex screws that are not easy to work on. The friction ring didn't like to hold on my oversize foam cushion grips. Like any friction lock, it has to be tightened perfectly, otherwise it won't hold, or won't release. So once you get it set, leave it alone ! On a standard bike with standard handlebars & grips, probably a lot easier to attach.
B000OR18HS|4|Working very well.
B004FXEHHU|5|Couldn't ask for a better pair of sunglasses. These are rather large for those looking for larger pairs of sunglasses, you couldn't find a better pair.
B00TTG79YQ|1|When I found out that Toyota wanted $54 for a replacement mirror I thought this would be a reasonably priced alternative. While the price is right, the fit is not.  It looks like the mirror was not cut using a template as it does not fit tightly in the frame.  It snapped into the frame and I am sure the full size double sided tape will keep the mirror glass from falling out. However, as the picture shows, there are gaps between the edges of the mirror and the frame.  I am not export on glass but the edges are not very well polished either.  It looks like it was cut out of a piece of plate mirror using a low end glass cutting tool and then no time was taken to clean it up.  I am sorry, but I cannot recommend this product. I am on my way to get a replacement mirror from Toyota.
B001E8EK1C|2|Stopped working after 2 weeks of daily use. Could have been another part but not worth trying to figure it out again.
B00C5RB03W|5|Fast shipping.  Great tight fit. I kept the one original that did not fall out somewhere in Kansas on I-80 for a spare.
B00029WYEY|5|works great although the filter cleaner is just brake cleaner and degreaser. but the red stuff works great.
B005EHPB2G|5|EVERYONE IS ASKING WHERE DID I PURCHASE THE COVERS FOR MY CAR I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE SEAT NOW AND WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT AMAZON
B0080B4H6E|5|Fits snug and works good. 2013 Ford Escape 2.0L
B001PYG9VY|4|Works good. I took one star off because the part where the hose attaches to the slave cylinder doesn't properly thread. I took the one off my old slave cylinder and used it on this one. Not a &#34;perfect direct replacement&#34; as the description states.
B0052XCTGI|2|Barely any paint and it appeared somewhat dry, perhaps outdated
B004XCRIKQ|4|Pads arrived quickly but they were the wrong pads. Even after typing in the exact car they were for. The only thing I wasn't able to input was that the SUV, these were for, had Brembo brakes and that was not an option when selecting car type although that was the standard option on this SUV. Not sure why these pasd came as the pads that showed up when selecting the drop down windows, for this SUV type, showed the proper pad so thought the correct pads were ordered. Returning was a little bit of a hassel as I had to mail these back at my expense minus a 10% stocking fee. I decied to go down to the local Auto parts store and buy them as they were almost the same priuce and I could make sure they were the correct pads
B005JNGB88|5|There is nothing more to say, this is hands down the best fitting, best looking, best designed floor liner on the market.<br /><br />If you are thinking about protecting your carpet and floor pan from rust, salt, and winter grime, this will serve that purpose a LOT better than even a great floor mat. (Its a liner not a mat).<br /><br />This was worth every penny to drop into my new car so that salt never gets in contact with the floor pan.
B00HFWZ1NW|5|The oxgords are very easy to clean.  I like them a lot.
B0009H519Y|5|Great job used mothers for years
B00D8LA0SK|3|The carbon fiber looks great.  There was a metal flaw in front surface.  Small but noticeable as the sun reflects on it. We learned after receiving the cover that it does not fit a Class V hitch when you install the 2&#34; adaptor.  The holes do not extend far enough back to align.
B0001EW02Q|5|Does the job.
B00FRZPN64|4|They don't keep'em in store but a Best Buy employee told me they use these things to track the Geek Squad Mobiles. So I'd figure I'd give it a shot for my catering business.  My main impetus was to check on rumors that my truck was being used on authorized stops. Drive through lunch breaks, home visits etc.  This does that and appears to do so much more.  I can see where my truck is at practically in real time.  It does go off line occasionally but appears that the trip data may be stored on the device for a bit as it sometimes appears back after disconnecting/reconnecting the device and driving around for 2 minutes.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of engine and battery data compared to a stand alone OBD as everything has appeared ok so far and my vehicle has given me no cause to think otherwise.  The only other fault this may have is that currently the information is only viewable through my iphone or ipad.  Logging into a website or a standalone pc app would be a nice addition.
B0002KR88A|5|Fits perfect but the quality of rubber isn't good.
B00KW2QGWM|5|Great light for the price no water issues. Reel bright had on rzr for a few months and several trips out with noe problems as well as several trips to the car wash
B00KTI9UQ8|3|Remote works great. It took me one or two tries to sync it to my truck but that was probably my fault. Unfortunately, about two months ago, the key FOB starting going through batteries like crazy. The battery will only last about 7-10 days. Once replaced, it works great again, until the battery dies again.
B00IJEZ4EG|5|Great item
B0007XVWW0|4|They fit my Atwood water heater.  Only down side is the &#34;head&#34; is larger than on the old one, so my largest socket (3/4&#34;) no longer fits it.  I think they sell a special wrench for it, though.
B003G360E8|1|Cover needed round hole cut and litle silicone !
B000CNB3FQ|4|fit is perfect
B005A2R628|5|High quality set.  Towels work great too!  Can't go wrong with Meguiar's!
B001GMTKUW|5|Towed a 10,000lb trailer from Texas to Alabama with this. No issues whatsoever. This is a heavy item, and I could not find it anywhere other than Amazon
B00EECM03A|5|Five star
B00A82C3VO|5|works perfectly
B003AVT2UU|5|Does this kit contain new replacement installation hardware, washers, bolts, nuts and spacers, as well?
