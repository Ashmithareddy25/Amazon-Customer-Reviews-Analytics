B00J06MCE2|5|Installed well, super solid, my trailer now has a third wheel JIC.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Just received this bad boy and assembled it. I can say that it is hands down much better quality then the ones you will find at Harbor Freight and Wally World. Item came just as described, the powder coating looks very solid, this is important since I live on a barrier island in Florida and the air is very salty. I plan on using this carrier in a few days when we travel down to Islamorada to go lobster fishing. It holds my 150Qt Marine cooler and 75Qt Marine cooler at the same time. I do have to place the 75qt cooler perpendicular to the 150Qt but its going to be fine and save space in my truck for other gear!
B002DOU7HC|5|I am very happy with this rack.  Good price and very sturdy.  We had three bikes on this for a 1500-mile road trip and it worked really well.  It was so nice not having to take the bikes off the rack to open the back hatch.  Also, there are plenty of ways and places to lock bikes.
B005LD45M0|5|Installed it on a 2013 Kawasaki Voyager. I couldn't locate one that had the reinforced straps for the Voyager. I wasn't sure if the trunk would hold up without the reinforcement. Fits and looks great!
B000CMJW64|5|A little puffy, but perfect for keeping the wheel cool to drive.  Seems solid.  If you check in with me I will update with how it holds up in the AZ sun.  It fits tight  but slips very little if you crank the wheel, you may not even notice it.  If you like it very tight you can strap it down.  Fit is 3/4 around my steering wheel.
B0007M30B2|5|It works perfect!
B00IUWLZMW|5|Perfect for our HONDA ATV TRX250.  I bought because of the price, but I was surprised to see a LCD screen with battery information on the status of the charge.  Excellent battery No issues.  Make sure you are using the correct charger for these batteries or you might wear it out.  Came charged and ready.
B0002M9UTS|3|Turns out I didn't need it, but for the price I'm not out that much
B00FHL4ZAS|5|Really amazing
B00020CB2S|5|I upgraded my audio system, but I was getting a weird tin sound echo coming from the doors. I looked into it and found sound insulation helps so I decided to give it a shot. I took the doors apart and insulated the entire inside skin and some of the outside panel parts. After putting it back together it sounds a lot better. The doors feel a lot heavier and close with a heavy thump compared to before. When you knock on the doors it no longer sounds like a tin can it sounds like a solid slab of metal. Inside cabin is quieter from road noise and outside the truck is quieter when you're blasting music. Win/Win for everyone. I'm pretty sure most people can do four doors and still have materiel left over, but I kind of went overboard and only had enough to cover 3 doors. Overall I'm really pleased with this product. You just have to be slightly careful when installing because the aluminum foil part can get sharp and it will cut you. Don't ask how I know. If you wear gloves you'll be fine, but there's little nooks and crannies where the gloves get in the way so you have to go RAW to get it in lol. I highly recommend this product.
B002PV0XRM|1|Bought these trusting Amazon products for my 2003 Mazda MPV and had them professionally installed. Van ran great, for a day and a half. Started misfiring again and barely made it home. Cylinder 6 coil was bad. Had it replaced with a Denso coil and back on the road again after paying another repair bill. Now I worry about the other 5 coils and plan on replacing them before they fail with Denso coils as recommended by the mechanic. You get, what you pay for. I do NOT RECOMMEND these coils. Update: Another coil failed a day after I got it back from the shop. With 2 coils having failed of the 6 I bought, I bought 5 new Denso coils and will have them installed when they arrive.  The service from the seller was awesome, fast and courteous but the product was pathetic.
B00K8E0WAG|5|I ordered this battery to be used with a Black & Decker 15 Amp charger for use on my small electric trolling motor.  Due to it's small size I was hoping to get a few hours of medium use on a charge.  This battery exceeded my expectations.  Over a weeks time and many fishing trips on a small lake I never ran out of charge, even after over 3 hours of medium-high use.  It's relatively small and light compared to the standard deep cycle battery and has a nice handing handle.
B005PZMLDY|3|Not for vehicle with side air bags ( SRS )
B003F798Q2|4|clips are not very robust.
B007Y86KTG|5|great
B00C2NSTXI|5|Perfect fit
B000W7X1J8|1|Did not fit my 07 2500 duramax. Shield only came up halfway on front of hood.
B00K9BFI84|5|Perfect - exactly what I expected.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Love these!  Finally no more groans of dismay when something important drops into that &#34;black hole&#34; between the car sweat and the console.  Such a simple idea yet it works great!  Very glad we bought them.
B00NXF0T46|4|These lights were pretty bright. I love them. The only problem is that it is very hard to get them to stick anywhere. Other than that, they are pretty good.
B00PXXACRU|1|Didn't fit 2011 -13 porsche cayenne<br />Beware product comes from China
B000AP57O4|5|K&N air filters on any high performance engine is a must, runs great and improves mileage. the only thing is changing the air filter of a Honda Goldwing is a real beast.
B00HFGIUAO|4|Initial impressions are very positive. Sounds volume comparable to stock, just a bit deeper. Fitment is not perfect, after spending considerable amount of time on trying to make sure everything is even, still not completely happy with position, height and angles of tips.
B001DCED5W|5|Worked perfectly
B007IVRN5Y|5|I spin round and round.
B00MB0E21U|5|I love it! It fits snuggley on my steering wheel. (Mazda  2) it keeps me from burning my hands.<br />And it makes driving nicer with soft  grip. And the color is bright pink!!
B00NQ8F2JW|1|not 8 gauge wire.  If you are lucky it is a 12 or 14 gauge.  It is no where near thick heavy enough for the needs of my solar panel array.
B003POLA84|4|My first time clay barring - a quick once over seems to have worked just fine on a 21 year old truck's paint job - surface seems smoother and shinier - takes wax easier, cleans easier and faster. When it cools down I'll clay bar again with a little more attention ;)
B004EFQP2Y|5|Love it!
B00CELYMB6|1|It dried with an odd pink tinge
B003E20RKE|5|After a lot of conflicting information on various websites and forums regarding the Sport vs Luxury edition, I decided to try the EUR1340 for the front pad replacements.  The EUR1340 are the correct replacement pad for a US spec, 2012 C300 Sport.  Non-US spec's and AMG versions may be different and require the larger EUR1342.
B000BUU5YU|4|Worked
B004EIAADG|5|This worked perfectly for keeping our electronics charged at our off the grid and off the road cabin in Canada.  I was afraid to plug expensive smart phones directly into the unit so I plugged the Jackery Giant Plus chargers into the USB outlet to and then used those pocket chargers to charge the phones and Kindles..  I wouldn't be afraid to plug my phone directly into the unit now that I have confidence it won't damage it.<br /><br />My sister used her iphone 6 for data, messages, e-mail, face time, etc. nonstop for ten days.  (So much for enjoying nature). The iphone 6's use a lot more power than the smaller phones.  We still had over 60% power when she left.  I was then able to plug the Schumacher in for about ten hours to charge.  It went up to about 80%.  It doesn't charge quickly, but it's good enough.  It then kept our smart phones which were used often for data charged another ten days.  The only noise it makes which we forget about until it surprises us is a beeping noise after something is plugged into the charger for a few minutes.<br /><br />I can't tell you if it powers coffee makers, air conditioners, hair dryers,  televisions, or anything else.  I just know it worked beautifully for my needs.  I would definitely do it again.  It is plugged in and charging for my next trip to the woods.
B00D42AFS8|5|i bought this over 1 year ago (April 2014) and kept in the car for emergency use.  i'm finally able to use it and test it.  My 2013 Mercedes C320 V6 wont start, the car battery is not fully dead, it still has power, just not enough to start the engine.  After i plugged this thing into the car battery, it jumps start the car no problem !  I have NOT test it with a complete dead car battery yet.  And remember to recharge this powerbank like every 3 months to keep it at full power.
B000B8N3G4|5|Perfect fit for my '63 Falcon.
B00HRY5PX4|5|Perfect!
B003YYW78W|5|Applied beautifully & I love the sarcasm!
B00DQHECRQ|5|A
B0006IX7Y2|4|Does it's job well.
B001FZNIL2|5|Excellent product for the money. Fit my 2012 Tacoma Short Bed Pre-Runner perfectly.
B007VEVH50|5|Worked great and fixed my problem.
B005ORBR9W|2|These didnt last long, the lenses kept popping out.
B000F3RYGA|5|Perfect fit and adjusts nicely... Lock/unlocks with ease
B00SA48S0M|2|It doesn't fit my 2003 wrx. Not even close. But it seems like a good exhaust the welds are solid and the sound is great, louder than I expected but still good. I have to take it to a metal shop now to get it cut and re welded to bend the right way.
B0049MTHTA|5|excellent
B0008G1NB6|5|worked great,easy to install fast shipping
B00PC3WCII|1|Didn't even fit to a 3157 housing.
B00M392VZS|1|This is not the part that was guaranteed to fit my 09 Malibu LT. I received it and it does not fit my vehicle.
B001GJ3EJS|4|Arrived quickly and as described. Great product for car/truck detailing.
B00A86SD0K|5|great deal and price.  makes my 2011 chevy Silverado look great ,and keeps every thing in the bed safe and dry.
B00BEIUU2U|5|Nice Helmet at an awesome price!!
B000O51VJ0|5|No more trying to start a log fire and smelling like smoke.  Best invention for camping.  We love our &#34;little red&#34;.  Now we get to laugh at every one else trying to get their campfire lit and stay lit.  😂
B002M589TA|5|If you are doing any drain/fill in rear diffs or transfer cases of any make/model this is awesome.  Everything from lawn mower trans axles to Silverado rear diff.  I used on a Honda pilot rear diff (gallon jug) and was done filling in minutes just recently.  Since they are so cheap I keep them attached to the gallon just for next use or use on same fluid so no mixing.  But yeah I have a stockpile of these now.
B009FTLR2M|5|Supereasy to install on my acura tsx. These lights are bright!!! Had them for over 4 months now and going strong.
B001GH1NFC|5|Fit my 2010 Jeep Liberty perfectly!
B005SGYN4K|1|Poor produced. Didn't fit right took car through car was pulled off and lost antenna.
B00MJU62BU|5|Perfect fit, perfect price.
B005IUH78U|5|I think these inexpensive tire gauges are all hit & miss.  I have tried several.  I finally invested in a good Joe's Racing digital.  However, this Milton has worked well for me (I now have two).  It reads close to the Joe's.  I am able to check pressure usually losing no air; that can be a real challenge with some of these gauges.  I keep the larger Joe's digital at home, and carry these in the glove compartments.  YMMV.
B00027GY4C|5|the right part
B000QV4VH6|2|Had the key cut professionally.  Followed programming instructions to the letter.  New key turns ignition switch, engine cranks, but does not start. Programmed again to be sure I wasn't doing it wrong.  Same result.  Other two factory keys start it right up.  Go figure.
B00H5D47K4|4|Impressive looking item, that looks just as it does in person as it does Online! Arrived on time from the seller.
B0046U4YPM|5|Exactly the same as what being sold at local auto parts, made in China! changed the 3 engine mounts last 2 yrs and  just got 35k miles on it.  Easy to removed and install, Hope it will last for 50k miles. Installed on 07 Ford Focus w/ M/T
B00FMOJZHS|5|Worked as advertised
B00139WO9C|5|this thing has come to my rescue more than once and always travels with me when im on the road. I love it!
B00PY2H1VK|5|Works well and has held up nicely after several car washes.
B00E9P9A4O|1|Defective, did not work, had no charge and would not charge up.<br />Returned for a refund.
B000P6UO2I|4|The ETC2000 Short OPen Circuit help me to solve 2 electric problems in 2 cars, one has a short and 10 amps fuse has been burned and the other was with an open circuit, Goood tool to solve the electrical problems in a car or truck.
B00WJOG4BO|4|Not sure why the 1 star person had such a hard time...install was about as easy as it gets (2015 2dr JK Rubicon). I like the look and color, but the reason I'm rating this a 4 star (almost thinking a 3 actually) is because yes the description says black...but what it doesn't say is that the grill inserts are a gloss black, and the bezels are a flat black...and that IS NOT mentioned in any of the write ups I saw. For those out there that like stuff like that to match...well,  you know now, they don't. You can always paint the things, but I wanted to be lazy and be able to install it and forget it!
B000LNY1MY|5|Nice stuff
B004GD7Y6K|5|Nice look at a nice price.
B00B1U6I54|5|Not often are you surprised by less expensive parts but this one was legit! Was shipped better than some light bulbs I bought from a different seller too..
B00DZXS1DM|4|Looks great on my car.  I didn't expect the screw covers to be plastic.
B00J0DV13I|1|Did not fit the truck. would not install like the directions sheet and the pictures. Was very shallow and would not hold very much. I returned the item. The only good experience I had with this purchase was the return was very easy and credit was issued quick as well.
B00N1YNRAW|5|Great
B004LF6KJU|5|Fit and works perfect
B00X6HVH06|5|Love it
B000CNAOKQ|1|Choke went bad after about 3 months of having installed it on my 80 C10. The truck is currently a project so it doesn't even get driven much. In those 3 months I maybe drove it 10 miles. I'll probably try a generic kit next, we'll see if its any better than the name brand Edelbrock.
B00BITJ64I|1|Studs pull out very easy. Overall product is good, as far as color and design, but attaching design needs to be improved.
B006N97JCY|5|Well mine are black but that doesn't really matter. What does matter is ACDelco seems to think you better have your own lube. All the Poly bushings I bought from Energy Suspension they came with lube while ACDelco products didn't. Just a small detail you better be ready for. Other than this they are a great replacement.<br />The old 99 ford f150 links come with a plastic spacer while this one had a metal tube. Also if you are replacing tierod ends, sway bar bushings, or a large amount of the front steering you better get some of these. My original ones had corroded to half the diameter they were when new under the rubber bushings. I say dirt, salt, water, and animal juices get trapped under the rubber eating away at them. So don't listen to your friends, if you live anywhere it snows you better get a pair of these along with your tierods. In Va we have about 2 bad snows every 4 years and my truck is only 16 years old with 140,000 miles and mine were trashed, couldn't see the bolt so everything looked fine.
B005BCT1KM|3|Purchased these to replace the factory hinges that came with my 2007 half doors.  These seem like a great solution.  One nice thing is they come with torx screws for attaching to the doors.  Other aftermarket hinges comes with allen head screws, which will strip out easily.<br /><br />Anyway, they seem like good quality.  However, I ordered 2 sets since I have a 4 door and the hinge pins on the 2 sets were 2 different lengths.  Figured Rampage could have better quality control.  I opted to send these back, since I didn't want to spend this kind of money on something I knew I wouldn't be happy with.<br /><br />They may work for you.  They seem to be one of the better solutions out there for JK powder coated aftermarket hinges.
B000I04Z7Q|5|I Love it! Just like what I expected.
B002KLTL1G|5|Excellent customer services From Fay Myers Motorcycle World. I am very happy with the purchase of these pants. I ordered the wrong size, but they exchanged it for a right size. The pants are very confortable. And for the material, you can feel that they are made of very good quality.
B00M3D7582|3|worked great . Thanks
B00XM107FC|2|No instructions, pictures on amazon listing do not tell you that the horn button connectors need +12v and ground, . Hooked it up as i would have hooked up any relay and it did not function due to the switch wires not being grounded in the harness. Connectors are low quality, Wire is low quality, relay is a standard China quality relay. Not impressed. if you do some easy web research you can put your own harness together and have better quality for the same price or less. NOT recommended unless you want to fuss with it.
B00L3NYVHQ|2|Picture is misleading.  It only comes with one glove and two towels.  Not two gloves and one towel.  Do not buy since the seller won't change label and description.
B000BTLXQ0|5|Looks way better than expected.
B00D5QWA36|5|Very nice and big.
B001BFTUW2|5|I have a Infiniti G35 sport sedan, my previous hawk brake pads had massive dust. I am very happy with these pads, all pads will eventually produce some dusts, but these are minimal. As long as the install is correct, these pad are quiet and good on dust, along with the great price, highly recommended. I have had these for 2 months now.
B003ZWG6T4|5|Arrived today and installed it. Works great easy set up just follow the YouTube clips.
B001MU5JOE|4|it seems like the normal one.
B004SREXVI|3|The vendor was very slow in getting these delivered.  Once installed, the product worked as it should.
B0074EN7AU|1|Lasted exactly 1 year...  Broke again.  DO NOT BUY FROM BIGFLYSPORTS!  They will not honor the 5 year warranty.
B00LGLIX4W|5|works great.... got two, one for each bike!
B001DRPA1S|5|Installed great, 4.0 bar for my 5 cylinder
B003BZD08U|5|good
B002ATD7NQ|5|Great item at good price.
B00P2VLFK6|5|They fit great, Very happy with product.
B008HZKRQ2|5|Good quality. Very complete. Quiet still after a month and 2000 miles. Im not a street racer poseur and these pads are perfect.
B00GZLMEPM|5|I used to do this manually. This is the best kit I've tried. I love it. Both headlights were like new in 20 minutes. Make sure your drill is 100% charged before you start!
B003R4XAYY|5|Initially I was worried about buying such a low priced item, but happy I gave it a try.<br /><br />Came well packed.  It arrived pressure sealed, when I took off the shipping plugs/plates, heard the pressure release.  Gave me peace of mind that the radiator was sealed and wouldn't leak.<br /><br />It is painted black, and was a perfect fit.  Has been working great for the past couple weeks.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality, especially for around half of what some of the others are going for.<br /><br />Would definetly buy again if I ever needed to, and recommend it to anyone who needs to replace their condenser.<br /><br />Update:  Condenser/radiator worked perfectly for 2 years.  Unfortunately had a rock thrown into it by a car in front of me, nicking one of the veins and causing a leak.  Glad to see they still carry it as I will be buying another.
B000C9VTFE|5|Nice filter. I thought I was buying a cabin filter for my (just acquired) 2003 Toyota Tundra.  Well,  there's no cabin filter behind the glove box, but this is a perfect fit for the engine filter.
B00B6X7PGM|5|Good buy. Works perfectly
B0079PJ75I|5|Oh, the unabashed pride I felt after I followed the few short steps provided in the package for guidance through theses turbulent times and successfully installed my shiny new alternator. Joy of joys, praises and a rising tide of human expression followed quickly upon the heels of the sound of my battery being fed electric life! FIVE GOLD STARS for the excellent condition the hardware I received, and of course the paperwork recording the efficacy of the very device I held betwixt my hands. I raised my v6 3.4 liter engine from the brink of apostasy and restored the thrumming of a satisfied machine to the fore through the cold logic transcribed upon the instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />RareElectrical, I praise thee. For you have convinced me once again that the internet is a place of automobile restoration and enjoyment.
B00Z2R1OJM|5|Great addition to the tool box at a great price, this hex but holder really help organize all the bits into in single location. No more fumbling around and everything is laid out according to your own preference. It is also magnetic so everything stays in place when moving the holder around, if even had it in a roll cart and everything stayed in place. Great product at a great price.
B00YI3IGA6|4|The ShadeSox is a great concept and I think it is better than the other shade I was using...but it doesn't fit perfectly on my BMW X3.  It leaves a gap at the bottom on the outside, and could be slightly bigger but covers all the way down on the inside, so hopefully that will be enough.  Not sure if I need to remove it to go they the car wash, but think I probably should.  I received the item promptly and the customer service seems to be excellent.  So far I would recommend it to all, but my grandson hasn't ridden with me since I got it and he will be the one to give a final thumbs up!
B000AMXSX4|4|it is a good product for the price.
B0070Y35S8|5|good you some good performance although I gave a lot of it away it was a very good
B009LRUJF4|5|Great product! Easy installation! It took all of 12 minutes to remove and install the new Strong Arm units. One person installation was simple, just be sure to place a ladder as shown in the video and I also braced the tailgate opening (Lexus RX350) with a  centered 48&#34; long 2x4. Also wear safety glasses as recommended, one of the spring clips did go flying.
B00JHK81X2|5|Bought for my sins first car. I feel safe knowing he has this in case of an energency
B00UL3E57A|5|Perfect fit
B008H2PL9S|4|Used it for the transmission and transfer case(247).<br />No Leaks so far.
B00VF8RY3C|5|I saw the difference right away after installing the supreme suspension kit
B005C2B7EY|3|plastic studs are too flexible. I am going to replace mine with metal studs
B001NYNIWE|2|I got this item because my water pump was making in noise after a quick install it worked fine. are almost exactly a thousand miles the pump started making noise worse than my old original
B000FP9WMW|5|Works great!
B00HTOB0NG|1|This just blew my hid light bulb
B00EMHUL10|5|This oil is hard to find and so far this has been the cheapest I have been able to find.  Put this in our 2012 Honda and it runs smooth with no issues.  My husband changes the oil about every 8000-10000 miles, which is mostly all freeway miles, and the vehicle is running great.  Worth putting this in your vehicle if your questing the price.
B00CFQUKTS|4|PARTS FIT GREAT
B00N9S82EQ|5|Too cute!  Even though I don't smoke.  I like the bling.  OL
B00PTVKHQM|4|Over all great product for the price. Like any kit it was missing a few bolts but it wasn't hard to find some at a hardware store.
B004131EDY|5|I wish they weren't yellow... But really you can't even see them so... Meh... They fit perfectly on my 2000 Dakota Quad Cab 5.9 4x4.
B002O3DFS0|3|Add some rubber washers so it wouldn't rattle.  A little on the small side on a big truck (Tundra)
B00N6ALLC2|5|Awesome
B00H6XPZN6|3|I think the shade works fine on a back window but I needed something for the front passenger window and the shape didn't work all that well. The passenger window on my Passat isn't square, it slopes down and the shade only fits the back part of the window leaving the front part exposed for sun to come in.  I'll keep the shades for the back windows but I am still going to look for something to fit my front passenger window.
B006CQ9BMO|5|This unit is great. Quick connect allows you to plug n charge. Desulfurization process is great. A must have for my motorcycle & riding mower. I can just toss this unit back and forth a few times over the winter season.
B000FPY06A|5|Great product
B00EF3YOYG|5|at the time..........
B000AA4RWM|5|Work just like they were intended to. Fast service
B004XXRAK8|2|Wrong size for my laptop. Had to return it.
B005H7DRQA|5|Best leather cleaner and conditioner I have ever used. Makes an old leather couch feel new again
B0021UMTZQ|5|Amazing!! The best quick glue that we have ever used!!
B00W87E8U6|5|Great floor mats!  They really improved the interior of our '09 Mustang.  The color is an excellent match for the factory carpet.  And the emblem looks fantastic.  These appear to be of very high quality.  They do require a vacuuming now and again at the beginning to remove some fibers.  This will settle down, I'm sure.
B00PJPHEBO|1|I had a code displayed on my car so I bought this to check it, when it connected to my car it immediately reset all the fault codes. It does this every time.
B000RXNV0Q|5|Fits perfect in my cup holder. Just wish they came in a 2-pack.
B000LZG7MO|5|I have a 97 virago 750. Good bike but handlebars and seat sucked.  I put drag bar handlebars handles much better but that mustang seat gave me hours of seat time I couldn't do with stock seat  unbelievable how much better it is now
B000PUHGGG|3|like the chrome, but all of them didn't stick on the truck like they said.
B009AA2HDE|4|Seems to have worked so far. Service air bag message is gone on 2007 gmc yukon. Code was B0083. If sensor fails i will update this review. Heres the link i used to video on how to replace, very simple.<br /><br />http://youtu.be/023sc1ZSB6s
B004KJ6KFG|4|It is heavy and I would suspect will be hard to breach.  But my hitch has a larger than normal flange around the ball coupler that proved a bit troublesome as the unit would not slide in far enough to engage the locking pin.  But, a hammer and 10 minutes of adjusting the flange so that it would slide into the unit and it works just fine.
B00CODRSEW|5|Worked great.  Just what I needed.
B004TNFB9E|1|needs to be noted in ad after switch is installed will need to be reprogrammed by gm dealer!
B007EHOWNI|5|work perfectly
B000WPW08S|5|Great quality bag done right looks great on my bike.
B00K7VR5UK|5|The Decals are of a good size. They went on easy and look good. I put them on a black trailer and it really makes the colors stand out. Take your time putting them on and use plenty of liquid. They came out with only a couple air bubbles, and they came out easy.
B00LRYUJFE|5|It's a magnet. It sticks to my car bumper and conveys my sentiments...
B00KZJQ2L2|5|My husband got this for me as a gift to replace my old shade that I had for over 10 years.  I originally purchased a similar shade at AutoZone, but it was 2 separate pieces and didn't fit quite right.  I love this sunshade!  It is big enough to cover my mini-van windshield with extra coverage.  I have not had any trouble folding it, but it could be tricky (again - I had the same style for over 10 years).  I love that it has a band that with hold it all together when folded and a case to put it in!  Thanks for a great product!
B00SVBT6JG|4|Sweet stuck it to my tank on my stugis trip ! Held phone with otter box. Put gas card in pocket for easy access.  Also used it for hand written routes on poker run.
B00QYIG6C8|5|Great Product, easy to hook up!
B0033QNZZ0|5|This is great stuff, and cheaper than mopar.  I think it is good to use, my them is lower than it was.
B001AVSIOI|5|The quality is awesome!  I did have to return it though.  The Swagman bicycle carrier I ordered uses a 1/2&#34; shaft.  I did not know that when I ordered this.
B00NEL6HK4|5|Great
B0019CL3KY|5|This little device replaced a second person or a mirror setup.  Worked as advertised.
B00IOFB7EG|1|Trust me dont buy. Read my review on the prime version. Of this<br /><br />Fits my experience perfect except it performance.s like ten year old used and torn wiper.<br /><br />Smears water and leaves residue alll over glass. Extremely loud like dragging.<br /><br />I can't believe such quality exist... Not exaggerating one bit<br /><br />Got this for my hybrid Rx and the wipers are ten times louder than car
B00E0ISKNM|5|The perfect 5-way connector for multiple RAID controller cards and one HDD activity LED.
B00AM3HGD4|5|you did an excellent job. I hope next time you do the same. thanks a lot!
B00IGINAUU|5|Stops my car.
B0045LCIM8|5|Worked perfect replacement.
B00QXDF3LE|5|My nephew loved this!  I bought him a generic space shuttle from the dollar store and as soon as he unwrapped it he placed the sticker right on it.  Really made the cheap toy look &#34;official&#34;
B00837AEGW|4|Item as described, only needed slight modifications to fit perfectly. Looks great !
B001GJ3FIS|5|works great!!! great price too
B00M435M3Q|5|WOnderfull
B000COCU84|4|Higher performance at a reduced life expectancy. Difference can be noticed, but cuts the usability by more than half of OEM or lowek K output.
B00PNUIKDG|5|Perfect OEM Relpacement
B00LK35H4U|1|These cross rails are covered in a tan dirt/grit! I'm not talking a little dusty, they are dirty and gritty. I'm afraid to touch them so as not to scratch them. Received with no directions, no torque wrench, and no bolts. Very disappointed!!!!
B0073VC6YM|2|Like other reviewers, I noticed an immediate degrading in the signal reception on most stations. Static was constant to the point I knew this was going back. While some report no change in reception when using the Stubby, that certainly wasn't my experience. I would not recommend it.
B000E4NKEK|5|Excellent product.
B00MWZCOSM|1|Did not work on my 04 yfz 450
B000A8JNF0|1|The product did not remove the dark stains on my brown roof.
B00EUI00KS|5|I love it and it makes me laugh!  I bought several and gave them to dog-loving friends.
B003CJNEX6|5|Excellent price and good product , in PUerto rico this part cost over $400
B00KTIUYIG|4|Sensor installed, CEL extinguished, I guess I can't ask for much more than that.
B002OQANT6|5|great ! will order again if I need more
B000COB8KK|5|Works perfectly
B00TOT3B1S|4|Bought this for my friend's C300 Mercedes.  The screen coverage is few millimeters little short on the sides, so one star off for that.<br /><br />Very easy to install and the bubbles wiped off with my credit card just like the instructions said.  The kit even include two finger cots to prevent contamination.<br /><br />My friend loved it.  The anti-glare feature is a must have.
B009B9JQWO|5|Fits perfectly, as they said it would.  Doesn't collapse and get floppy, like the foam-only ones tend to.
B000C6MLIQ|5|works and compatible
B00AQZBAOO|5|Fit just like it was supposed to.
B000WKF698|4|just what was needed.
B0009JKGII|1|Do not use this product -- a well-rated video on YouTube will tell you to use isopropyl alcohol or hand sanitizer. That's what I should have done, but now the hood of my car is terribly discolored and looks like I have a maroon camouflage paint job.<br /><br />I called Customer Service / Help and they recommended buffing it out with a light compound. A) nowhere on the bottle does it say any extra steps are required and B) I just moved for work. When and where do I have the time to put up with this?<br /><br />If I could give this product no stars, I would.
B000NW8EFI|5|Exactly what I needed and fast shipping.
B002G3OG6S|1|There is not a star low enough to represent the uselessness this was for my Audi A4 Quatro. It may fit on a car but NOT THE AUDI A4. The real problem was that after going through all the push ups to identify the car , make, model, etc. they still screwed up the order. Original equipment my a__.
B00EKPOG10|5|works great
B000GOHUUS|5|Runs like new! on my 99 Corolla
B00NGOPVU6|1|DOES NOT FIT!!!<br />My original fell off close to state inspection time so after realizing how long an exchange would take, was forced to stick on anyway.<br /> I'm SO irritated with this company everytime I change lanes, it makes me really hate them for not getting an accurate measurement for something a child could've traced better with a crayon and scrap paper.<br />Call a junkyard for common cars, or get oem from manufacturer for rarer cars. Whatever you do, avoid Burco.<br />I thought I could cheap out, that no one could screw up something as simple a small flat mirror...I was so wrong:(
B00HTV2N4E|5|Makes it easy to change oil in motor home.. No mess or fuss.
B00GLLW3AM|5|Lights look great. Not sure if they will be good on a rainy day or not but we'll see.
B00BTT3DTQ|5|Easy to install, looks nice. Does not hide the license plate.
B009VTI6UC|3|I switched out the original rear shocks at home with a somewhat easy installation on my '01 Tacoma PreRunner. I am, however, not overly impressed with much of an improvement. Nothing noteworthy at all. The old ones didn't even expand when removed, so were very worn. Before nice roads were smooth enough, but anything rough was very rough. Afterward I'm still getting a rough ride on the bad roads I drive every day. I will be replacing the front when I buy new tires very soon so there may be a noticable overall improvement then. Hopefully.
B004PL4EPW|5|Great
B001DRJNCK|5|Excellent value, and it fits a 1998 For F-150 perfectly
B00U6HP4UI|5|Love these. Last way longer than oem and a fraction of the cost.
B005HBBZEM|4|OK
B004YL37BU|5|My husband has looked everywhere for one of these key chains!!! I finally found him 2!!! Thanks a lot now if I can find one just like this one by says chevell on it lol!!
B005O52SVK|5|Like the color
B0061XFPPA|3|Got two, one flickers and the light from 18&#34; above is hardly noticeable, needed these to be brighter!!!
B002SINBRQ|5|I loved the carrying case. They are wonderful!
B000AL4WBC|5|Very happy, just wished I would have gone to the next size longer, but it still works like a champ!
B000CODH0O|5|Great tie downs
B004BRK3T6|5|NICE BAR, FAST SHIPPER, A+
B00VKM3PSQ|1|I received an oversized cover that did look very well main. I've had many cover for my suv's and for the price. It wasn't worth it.
B00RGKW66I|2|Leaks, I have so much moisture in it I give life expectancy of it 2-3 months
B000KIVPME|4|Great new shop addition.
B009ZQ12F2|5|Excellent
B000F18RL8|5|Was exactly what I ordered, color was spot on and fits very well. I'm pleased with this product
B005CCJ25K|5|Outshines my headlights easily. Even behind the grill. Easily wired up but I did have to add wire to put my switch where I wanted to.
B00O4Z5XOA|4|Good quality did not go flat camping!
B00192KY22|5|perfect fit
B00B3Q18P6|5|outstanding.  Looks great, works well, easy to install.
B001U27N84|3|Be very careful when putting screws in - they can only be put in once so if you make a mistake you have to use your own. Light does work well once you get it mounted.
B00BGIBAMC|5|The spoiler looks great on the vehicle and works perfectly. Very pleased with the purchase.
B0009H51KS|5|These are just the best in the budget world of air filters. Its all i use anymore- they last a while, do their job, and are very cost effective! what else can i say about them?
B005N6X1JI|5|Love this tank!
B00PLIYNYK|4|Good product, good seller services!
B00X65LH9O|5|Excellent fit and very comfortable
B003YMRNV0|5|On Time delivery and excellent product.  Truck hasn't stopped this nice in a long time.
B00GHQBL8Q|5|Perfect fit<br />Best price I ever seen
B00F5MU5YY|5|Great during the drought ... easy turnoff.
B00G4T9CKU|5|Not bad but I got yellow instead of white like it is listed
B000C16XL2|5|Very easy to install. So far works great. I installed on my Chevy Silverado.
B002NZWGWK|5|Easy install, took an hr. Great fit. High quality.
B006L6R3CU|5|Recently bought these for the interior of my jeep they work great as expected brighter than I thought...really fast shipping will buy from seller again..
B001VXXUWK|5|This is nicer than I expected. Honestly, through the pictures, I thought I was getting a glorified pull-down face shield. This is far better than just a face shield though. It has little selector tabs inside to control how far the screen tilts forwards/backwards. Also, the size adjustment dials lock (just push in to adjust and release to lock) which keeps this on my head regardless of how much I sweat or how much movement I decide to throw at it. Overall, this is a very good face shield. The clarity of the lens is outstanding, although it is a little bit of a pain to get in and out of the frame. I would certainly recommend it to anyone that needs to protect their face and neck.
B00HVHEFJW|5|Fits My 2010 mitsubishi lancer gts key exactly as it should.
B001PYG8HE|5|Alright quality
B00I0BU9LQ|4|Will this fit in my Kia Rio LX? I really want this one
B00XIUY8S4|5|Looks great easy to apply and rear hatch closes without an issue.
B00DMWK2P6|5|great product
B000S2QK40|5|Excellent
B0048EBVI4|5|Exact one
B00LXKYA0C|5|I have used this for a few months now and really thought it wouldnt last, but it has held up and works amazing when you are in high traffic and need to see literally EVERYTHING around you.
B00P3SLOFY|1|I too would give this piece of crap zero stars if I was able. First use the handle snapped. Had to drill holes in the nub that was left over and rig a rope to it in order to get it the rest of the way to the dump. There is no gate valve, so expect to spill waste water when you go to dump. Be careful and preemptively tighten the clamps on the hoses; they'll fall right off. After dumping the one and only time, the float part of the auto shut off/fluid level indicator was missing. I assume it went through the hose and into the ground. The wheels on this thing are cheap and will break eventually. I cannot believe Thetford would sell something like this to people. My RV dealer was disappointed that someone sold it to me from his store. I brought it back and swapped it for a Barker 4 wheel tank. NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE. Go Barker! Someone actually thought about that tank for more than 3 seconds.
B009IHK8KI|1|The corner light assembly I purchased is splitting on the top of the turn signal housing and water is getting in, causing heavy condensation. It looks like whatever material is used to seal the plastics is deteriorating and splitting. This is the second unit that has done this. Originally purchased 11/2014. Replaced on 4/2015. Now it is 8/2015 and doing it again. Spec-D REFUSES to replace even though the latest assembly has only been on vehicle 3+ months. BEWARE of vendor and product.
B008DRFE2Q|1|tail lights and brake lights don't work out of the box. got the power going in. waste of money
B000C7S4LS|5|Was as spected
B002IB1JOA|5|Worked as promised!
B005ETCYYC|4|Only thing you can use.  Find the best price and there are no substitutes.
B007P749LC|5|Excellent
B00T47K604|1|it wouldnt fit anything!!!
B008KQLDFC|3|Ok felt too rubbery and had to return them
B00480J4KA|5|bright as can be, and the price was 80 bucks less than OReilley's.
B00K7X8WBY|5|I'm very happy with this order. It arrived just in time.<br />The size is perfect and fits very well in my car.
B007Y4BL1C|5|We keep this in the car for those rides where you need a laptop or to recharge camera batteries during the trip.
B00279B196|5|Exact replacement for the Bosch alternator pulley on my '05 Jetta TDI (BRM engine).  The only difference I could see is that the plastic dust cover is now made in the Czech Republic instead of in Germany -- pulley itself is still from Germany.  No more belt chirping at low RPM!
B000DLBIGG|5|I bought these horns to replace the stock (meeb, meeb) horns on my scion xb. I couldn't be more pleased with the sound, just like my corvette, gm loud and toned. These are more than worth the $19 I spent, and very easy to install. Now I get noticed when trying to get someone's attention.
B00EKTJQ5W|5|Looks great on the truck.  Easy to install.
B00FPYPP74|5|Great price, fast service, and works as expected. Another great Amazon purchase. I love Prime service from Amazon.
B00ATXEPQI|3|works pretty well but if you want to charge two USB devices simulatenously you'll have to use the AC plug with the brick that came with you phone/device. Also I feel like this device should've lasted longer than it did.  Had to replace it.
B00UT2JIJ8|1|Ordered 2 of them, and the glass broke on both before I could even install them. Once the glass breaks, the delicate thermometer breaks too.The second one I tried to be extra careful with and it still broke! Seller would not take back. I purchased a clock similar to this a couple years back and had no problem.
B000OGH21K|5|they were perfect.....thank
B00D5VM35G|5|Easy to install and worked great!
B000CKGAV6|5|Great
B000CKSXD4|5|a++++++
B00B3UTP16|5|THIS CLEAR COAT WORKS WELL
B00EVMT6A8|3|too large; gave to my daughter for her SUV.
B00HXJ8MBK|1|Bought 2 sets of these for a 2015 Nissan Rogue and a 2014 Nissan Maxima. I have to think these problems will be true for most newer cars:<br /><br />The back seat bench cover completely hid all the seatbelt latches on the seat (as well as the entire middle seatbelt), so use of seat belts in the back is impossible with this installed. Headrest covers are included, but the back seat cover has no holes to accommodate the headrests themselves, so you WILL NOT be able to use headrests in the back, unless you cut holes in them yourself. The back seat bench cover requires you to connect loops with S-hooks under the seat, but there was almost no room under the seat to get my hands in there, so this was impossible.<br /><br />Also, there is an armrest/cup holder console that swivels down in the middle of the back seat, and the cover made this impossible to use.<br /><br />We returned these, and I think a better option for the back may be to buy 2 front seat covers. Though it's a bench seat, the right and left sides are actually separate. This will allow the seatbelt latches and middle seatbelt to remain free and the console to swivel down, and the front seat covers DO have holes for the headrest.
B00BAZBYTU|1|Does not fit SL500 as shown on the site.
B0058RKTGA|5|Great product.  Looks fantastic on my Versys 650
B005JU5YCU|1|Received this wiper blade about two months ago and immediately installed it on my car. After using it I noticed that the wiper wasn't any better than the year and a half old one I just took off my car. I decided to just send it back and go with rain x blades from my local store and they seem to work much better so far. Its a shame because I loved my Bosch ones I had before.
B00DJ5KL6Q|5|Very nice grips for the price. I attached on my four wheeler with some automotive trim adhesive and they don't slip at all
B00076PMV4|5|Great strap for my intended use. I bought 2 - one for each of the ATV's in the household. We had the straps delivered to the campground while on vacation. One was used two different times help others out of their &#34;stuck&#34; circumstances. Worked great and ready for future use.
B001CEG90I|5|exact fit. however, pay attention to the air flow instructions as it can be easily reversed.
B00029WYVW|5|exactly what I needed to service my K&N filter
B000MK5LVG|5|Well built box
B000S2S5TI|5|Seller shipped it quickly and part worked great
B003N8QRIK|2|Driver side mat does not stay down
B001B5GA0C|1|Clutch makes noise since day one I took it to a professional shop for the intall and they said it looked fishy like a fake not authentic<br />Now it's slipping and no help
B00BXX3YQ0|4|I like this design as it does have some access advantages over a conventional combination wrench.  Quality seems good.  Fit and finish are not superb but should suffice.  Have not tested the durability over time yet.
B00PLIYNYK|4|Great bright white light output, equivalent to xenon HID without all the bulk. Great bargain
B00XKS4DNY|1|Failed after 50miles.
B0074A5KE0|5|Recently bought these for the interior of my jeep grand Cherokee..they work great and are brighter than I thought...shipped really fast, thanks. Will by from seller again
B000JZB40Q|5|fits and works fine on a mercury cougar 2.5 year 98.5
B008XVKANA|5|good
B00N1WJ95G|5|Excellentroduct.
B000CCG19A|1|Worked good for a whil. Stopped working after about 6 races.
B005CKSZX2|5|love them match my bright green car
B000CMDE1S|5|This worked great on 99 Cummins! It dose slide over stock column which if you do it right still looks awesome. I installed my colbalt autometer gauge in it and looks great. You will want a dimmer option here as it is right in your face if too bright. Comes with everything needed to install. Sticky pads or flush molleys, which is what I used. You will just need to unscrew the tilt knob lever so you can slide over stock column.
B00NMOYPVG|5|Much nicer package than a similar unit I built DIY from the compressor and condenser of a window-mount air conditioner.  With shutoffs and meters, it is well worth the price.
B0009N30EQ|2|I gave it a 2 because the straps that hold it to your visor were too short to fit my F250 SD  Other than that it was fine.
B00415B7ZM|5|pefect, its a toilet. direct fit for OEM.
B000EVU8C0|3|I ordered this to read ABS code on a 1992 Buick Le sabre, guess what  its the only one it doesn't read. Should say this in the add out front before you buy
B0041DX7E8|5|Had a mechanic to put it in. Works as expected and perfect.
B0059HN58I|5|Perfect! Great way to support my kids and the Navy in general.
B00LVXTVJG|5|Fit right.
B00A7EPBSK|1|This is a case of you get what you pay for. It's poorly cut, looks very cheap, very uncomfortable. Extremely thin in comparison to others.
B000M8R0QM|5|I bought this to replace the one my puppy decided to destroy (he's a BIG puppy!). These things are great, and come in very handy.
B000CB3ZY0|4|Fit perfectly in a 2001 VW Jetta GLS, and looks identical to OEM piece.
B000NCOKV0|5|Item arrived and I immediatly begain charging my travel trailer's deep cycle battery. It's a 70 amp, so I figured about 56 hours to charge from dead. That was Saturday. By Tuesday afternoon it was fully charged. I watched it go through the 3 separate modes of charging. Comes with both clamped and ringed terminals. The ring for the postive was a bit smaller than the nut post on the battery. I cut the ring open with a pair of dykes. Problem solved. Looking forward to adding a second battery to my travel trailer.
B0006IBYSI|5|C'mon, it's lube....
B0031HOJTM|5|Worked great.  Found that one of the straps on my 97 cummins was broken.  Replaced both with this kit, no issues.
B0076378FO|5|love
B001GF2T5W|5|It fit perfectly on my H2.
B000C7ZCHM|5|exact replacement.
B00029J3WK|5|The cooler works great and priced right.
B007KTINWQ|5|a good price
B003IOITIK|5|Works exactly as it should
B003EP0X1O|4|happy with it
B000B68BW2|5|it works good
B00BVL7W1C|4|did as advertised will keep these for future tire changing
B00GOR6G0G|3|Receive part, works well!!
B000GKTYNI|5|great product
B00W8LRD90|5|Nice!!!
B00BRAVCEK|5|No difference in reception from my factory antenna, and added style to my sport coupe.  I've been slowly adding exterior accessories, and this compliments the color scheme and look of my vehicle.  High quality and great reception.  Can't beat the price...best bang for your buck.
B0028JPECA|4|It does the job!!
B00V7YWYZM|5|I really like it, it slides around a little more than I would like, but makes driving for a while in hot South Florida much more comfortable.
B008QW9AR8|5|Nice boots for the price.  Fit as expected and delivery was prompt. Would recommend to friends.
B000BQW5LK|4|This was very helpful for refilling the manual transmission fluid after I drained it.  There might be a faster way, e.g. the beer bong method, but this was cleaner and more precise so less mess and waste.  If you are going to use this to drain and fill your transmission.  Please help yourself and make sure you can remove the fill plug before the drain plug.
B007JAFP6S|5|Design looks nice. Easy to apply. And was delivered quickly.
B00EAOIDEM|5|very good filter
B000VKTUD2|5|Fit my 2005 Prius great.  Easy to install, no tools required.
B001FRWCG2|5|Fit my 1991 GLI perfectly, my original handles broke because of a valet who tried opening the door while it was locked....I know! Go figure! Speedy delivery!
B004PL4H0O|5|worked as expected. it does what a lashing strap should do.
B00SH1SN6C|5|love it!
B00M8UHSX2|4|I suggest buying some sort of washer in order to prevent the nut from digging into the bottom of the hinge, otherwise I like these foot pegs.
B00EEKNPBI|4|Seems to be holding up well
B00KJ8L7B4|1|did not work properly when received
B00KMR3J7M|4|I have had other brands of tailgate lights before, but this one (so far) is the best yet.  Easy to install and looks real nice on my 09' RAM.  Thanks Again!
B00F5MKKMG|5|Make sure you know how big it is. Ended up being a little bigger than expected, but it still looks great.
B001EZ3T8A|5|Both sides were bent slightly from shipping.  Since I had read of this problem on the reviews prior to buying, I caught it and fixed it quickly with my bench vise.  I would recommend they ship this with a small piece of wood jammed or tapped into the open ends of the hitch to stop it from happening on future shipments.  Easy to install and works like a charm!
B005A9VU6Y|5|It works and has more find than the original
B000BXKZ6K|5|Another wet bandage product I tried failed immediately.  This was sticky, self-adhesive, and made a nice tight repair.
B00UVKYHW6|4|we like it although it does shift a bit and is not a really secure fit. But it is comfy I want to wait and see how long the buttons on the back side last. I did try to order another one at the same price because they were out of stock and it would not ship to my address with Prime. I had to pay more for that same product to get it here. That was odd.
B0090W09Q4|5|Good replacement for original valve. Easy installation. Better deal than the RV dealer pricing.
B00N7N9KOO|5|I ordered the orchard white for my wife's Honda Civic LX 2012. itfit perfectly and it was easy to installed it also comes with the brake light but you need to buy wire and it probably takes 10 minutes to plug it in very satisfied with this purchase
B00U1G5AR6|5|Worked great as replacement for the rear window controller in my 86 Toyota 4 runner.
B004XMBXRU|5|I drove for 5 months with my fuel door taped closed because the dealer quoted nearly $400 to replace it. I ordered this and within 10 minutes it was installed and I was only mad at myself for waiting too long.....
B006TML0B6|5|Fit perfectly
B003VBMAK8|5|Will work great when I have time to make new camper curtains.
B002JC2IOS|5|Perfect fit
B000C00ZSA|4|Would have given it 5 stars if it truly came with everything you need to rebuild your rear drum brakes. You will need to purchase parking brake struts if you don't have them, and the corresponding springs.
B00XPTP9TU|1|Solder connecting the wires broke almost immediately
B0050DBMZ4|5|Looks great. Takes a moment to install. But well worth it.
B00519SYBC|5|A+++
B0026RUOPQ|2|Didn't get the performance that I expected ..... trouble picking up channels
B00UL7D0G8|5|Nice!
B00AUFMHNI|5|fit great
B000JFHNQA|5|This is a lot better method of starting a dead battery than jumper cables. Highly recommend this purchase. Wish I had done it sooner.
B00YML13OU|5|I&#34;M a rookie driver and there were always people beep me. But after sticked this to my car people knew I was learning and beep me less. NOte: review in exchange discount
B00086I72O|3|Awesome
B003POL5PM|5|I use them where i won't put my Korean rags like door jams, inside engine bay, stainless exhaust, etc..  Good enough for ten ducats!
B00VY75KYO|5|excellent
B000E3CYIY|1|cheap made, so yellow.
B0006PY0P0|5|great buy highly recommend
B00080QHMM|5|Love it!!
B006FL1WWS|5|Kia needs to make this a &#34;standard&#34; item. it was very easy to install, even for someone not mechanically inclined like me!
B00Q81D1Q0|1|Amazon had to do a refund for the bad light. Eyourlife would not fix,replace or refund for one bad light out two. Do not buy from Eyourlife they will not help you...
B005G9B2PM|5|Cheap replacement. Cheaper to buy a whole one than buy a rebuild kit. Easy to install. I may just buy a bunch to keep on-hand and swap out every year.
B00T5DJMWA|2|Not very good quality.
B000BUQOBS|5|Very strong
B000LNU41Q|4|Pumps great. Good air seal. Easy to take on and off tire. Has nice clips to hold the hose when not in use. Pressure gauge is wildly inaccurate. My bike tires call for 65 pounds. That is reached when the gauge reads 56 pounds! I used a Milton Industries Inc. S-920 Tire Gage to determine this, which I trust a lot more than this pump's gauge.<br /><br />At least the gauge seems precise, if inaccurate. It has a little arrow you can rotate around to point at a certain value. I have this pointed at 56 pounds, and when I pump to there and measure with the Milton gauge, it always comes out the same.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works as advertised.
B00W4EDEK8|5|Excellent deal
B00QMO8HLM|4|work just fine
B00267PZUK|5|This tool is amazing, Don't worry about breaking the spark plugs off in your 3 valve Ford Triton engine, this tool will get them out fast and easy.
B000CF603E|4|Worked great.
B0078U9KKG|4|It is what they said it was.  As far as parts go that's really all you can ask for.  I didn't end up using it for various reasons (none of which their fault).
B008IKA932|5|It took longer to get here but it is what i expected.
B009II5CMQ|5|Great price for an alarm replacement battery!  Solved my low battery alert issue.
B001C8YQW2|3|Put them on my Odyssey huge improvement in stopping power, but started squeeling like I had $20 brake pads, I applied BG brake quiet and it toned it down.  Only had them on for roughly 10K miles and they are worn down to 3/32... also dust ALOT and it cakes onto the wheels... I do like them but when paying a premium price and they squeel  like $20 brake pads... sorry to me that's not acceptable...
B00LNJI1KI|5|Very satisfied with this light bar very bright
B00B0PDRIQ|5|Works well and looks good. I use this all the time now on my old cars, it doesn't slide or allow tools to slide off.<br /><br />Hate to admit it, but I used to use a towel on the car to keep from scratching the car but always chasing the towel down or cursing when my tools fell off. I think it was actually my wife who said &#34;Why don't you just get one of those fender covers like shops use&#34;.....as always, she was right. Should have gotten one of these years ago
B0046IDP2M|5|Love it! Easy to install and sounds awesome! Definitely feel a little more power
B000GZGUP8|5|Fit my 2005 Nissan Xterra perfectly
B00DJ4FMA2|5|Very good ATF.  I like the fact that it is full synthetic.
B004PLA64U|5|the right part fit great
B00BC127DO|5|Excellent Decal
B002S0C46S|1|Took car to shop for diagnostic because of emissions workshop alert and check engine light. They told me the air pump was dead and needed to be replaced. It was a good deal price wise, but I an still going to have to pay another $500 to have it fixed properly.
B00C8E91CE|5|great deal, installed easily
B000GZKDBA|2|Didn't fit Good at all not even close but with a some trimming you can make them work.
B00OLP5VN6|5|Is nice and comfortable
B007Y699XW|5|fit ok
B006HHRJFY|5|I am a British mechanic living in Germany and trying to buy these brake line nuts which fit american cars like jeep Ford GM can be very expensive . I read on a forum that Jeep dealer wants €10 for 1 nut. I have had to reuse the old nuts in the past by drilling through the frozen piece of old line. I tried to buy these nuts in Europe but they are very expensive and actually hard to come across . I am lucky because I have a work college who is American and I could use his mailing address so I got these at a sensible price. Now I can hand make my brake lines on American cars and the job looks really professional as I'm very good at bending and shaping flaring brake line. ( Brits call them brake pipes I think brake lines sound better)
B0091OE6K6|5|love these have given several left in cars i have used them in. love em
B00009PGNR|4|We used this going across the country and back, it kept the food cold.  the only downside was that there was condensation in the cooler and if the sandwiches weren't wrapped up they may have gotten soggy.
B000C7TU9I|5|good fit and good for the money
B0002ILK6I|5|Awesome dry cell. 100% happy with it.
B000AMXQDG|5|This product as an artificial sweet smell that lingers for days on your tires but the shine lasts longer than any product I have ever used.  Makes the white paint really stand out!!
B00HVHA0EG|5|Good product
B005MVB6TG|2|This product has a &#34;lifetime warranty&#34; except for the tips. The tips are the weakest part of the tool. So much for a warranty. I would expect them to stand behind their product. Your money may be better spent somewhere else.
B008L5J5G6|5|I purchased a used Ranger a couple months ago and the plastic handle was broken on my tailgate. Found this metal one. Don't know why the manufacturer would install plastic knowing it will break over time with regular use. Metal is the way to go! Easy install & works great!
B00H1XU7D4|5|Fit great & was easy to install. been on our truck now for a year, still 5 stars!!
B00HQZA4J4|5|Fit Perfectly, Great price. I highly recommend
B0031BL9I2|1|started to leak right away from the bottom of the drink tube.

B000C7WWUW|5|worked great so far so good.
B0089LSMSE|5|good price
B00026Z3HC|4|Price is great<br />Works OK
B000BXOFJI|5|I have used this for many years and was so happy I found it on the internet.  Thanks so much!!!
B001DRLBIY|5|This fits my 1997 Pontiac Sunfire very well and they have improved my braking performance dramatically (although I replaced the shoes as well).  I almost gave this 4 stars because one of these cylinders I bought had interfered with the wheel hub but I did a few passes over the surface with the grinder and it fit perfect.
B004D5Q296|4|good product
B000CMH45U|5|Perfect. I was worried about how many I was paying for. Turns out its a box of 20. Just what i thought for that price. They should add that to the description.
B00Q1EKHK2|5|My wife was so happy I got this for her!
B000C2WFA4|5|it worked out perfectly
B002R1PVSG|5|Looks great and easy to install.
B00G620ZVU|5|Great working light very bright does the job good. Thumbs up for them
B00S5XSN6M|1|Te
B001DUEWJ6|5|Exact fit, beefy construction. 07 Outback.
B00WDSVEE8|4|I bought these to put in my fishing boat bag for people who come fishing that wear glasses and don't have any polarized sun glasses.  These are really lightweight.  I like the dark lenses and the smaller clip-on attachment piece.  This will make that part less noticeable in the field of vision when wearing them.
B00TPM298U|5|justn right
B000C496TU|5|It works correctly
B0016KFVHA|5|good
B00F8RI2NM|2|Arrived on time, very hard to install,  both fell off in 2 to 3 days, inspite of extensive prep of the attachment sites I think the 3 M tape might have been compromised as seemed not to stick well  on any of the 4 strips, think it might need an activator pack to work right.  I reinstalled with a clip system I devised and eliminated the tape totally. Also turning the wheel to allow wheel well liner to pull back is ok if you have arms like a stick figure, I took the wheels off to get enough access.  Had to do this twice due to 3 m tape fail. So far my clips have worked well.
B00BYNJAVW|1|Overhyped junk
B00MWI0F2G|5|On time ,fit perfectly, easy install, nice look, just enough , not too much chrome.
B0040CYWX0|5|worked great..... fit in a 2000 Impala
B00I2JIUXA|5|Perfect Fit! Works Well....
B000CAINDE|5|It's a little big for my 98 Honda Accord, but I would rather have it too big than too small. Does the job and super reasonable price.
B00EKX70ME|5|Fits and looks great.
B00JFOI2IY|5|Bought these to do some wiring and they worked perfectly!
B003IS3HV0|4|Seems to work fine. Doesn't leave a sticky residue and does leave the leather very soft.
B0012FKF9S|5|Wonderful!
B00I617AAS|5|Very cute! Arrived on time.
B00GWFOPTO|4|Works well as it is designed.
B0055DREB0|5|Does what it says.  I used it to hold the bottom on my Coleman Liquid Fuel Lantern Hard-Shell Carry Case as the tabs are a bit sketch.
B000FQ22J6|1|Does not fit the application
B002QAOBBQ|5|Perfectly fit my daughter's 2000 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD.  It's very sturdy plastic and looks very nice.  It goes on with two sided tape and seems to be firmly in place.
B007ZDDUCK|5|Conditions my leather boots very well and is easy to apply.  Great product.
B00ZZGE4LU|5|[[VIDEOID:432967db2247f385b1a87c05042e7981]] This is a great unit to take camping with you to charge all your tech gadgets plus it will boost your car what more could you ask for it's an all in one power pack.
B0080DYGZ4|5|My Grandson installed this yesterday and it works great. We did not realize just how worn out the previous unit was until this one replaced it on our 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche.
B00JONUB8A|4|Great sticker, seems good quality. However, I did not receive a practice sticker, OR directions on how to apply it! Just an envelope with the sticker in it. With that said I am pleased with it and like the fact that the turtles could be cut into five separate stickers,as they all come on one sheet, so they don't have to be used as a whole.
B00A7EP8HO|3|It was to small for me so i gifted it
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Works great and great price
B00CHXBR32|3|Bought this for my 5th wheel so I would have one cable instead of having to use the stock cable and an extension. The cable arrived quick but just like another person posted the black locking ring was broken when it arrived. I can understand why since the ring is cheap plastic and the cable is about 27 lbs. The bouncing around during shipping could have easily broken the plastic ring. Rather than going through the drama of returning it, I crazy glued the crack and I'm sure it will work fine now sine the locking ring really doesn't hold the cable on anyway. I have a 50 amp hook up in my backyard so I tried the cable out and everything works great. Its nice to have one long cable for those sites where a standard 25 ft cable just isn't quite enough.
B009VPROGS|5|I received this cap as a gift - it has a good, high quality solid feel. The buckle is cloth with metal clasp. High quality all around.<br />I don't own a lot of caps, maybe 2-3, but this is the best quality of all of them.
B004A6MC5Q|2|Bolts did not line up correctly on 2005 kia spectra
B00BG916KC|5|Fits and works perfect
B000FQ01TE|5|Economical, good looking fuel gauge at a bargain price. Fast shipping.
B001O039US|4|People are saying mine is a aftermarket part that fits on the shift cable. Cant find a video or photo of it anywhere. Could use help trying to find this part. Its a plast piece that snap in half cause of heat over time. Please help thank you

B004SMN1HU|5|This wiper was a perfect fit for our rear wiper on our '09 Ford Edge
B000NOQTQC|4|Works good
B0000UUX34|5|What can I say? It's a K&N. Great product and great deal from Amazon
B00Q0LJCMK|5|Works great !!!<br />It is a real heavy weight.
B00503PPU2|3|Nice quality system, easy install on my 2003 Ranger 3.0L extended cab. But the sound is disappointing. It's more of a drone and sounds like a stock muffler that's going bad. Really has no sound presence - not even a discrete rumble at idle. It's been on my truck for over two months now with no change. I wasn't looking for an overly loud system, but was hoping for at least a growl at quick acceleration from a stop. Overall, I'm acoustically disappointed. At least the deal I got included a $50 rebate which I can put towards a competitor's muffler.
B00LSOE076|3|Fast shipping, ,works good... giving it a 3 because the rocker switch is cheap... had used it like 4 times is all and swith quit,,, had to purchase a good toggle switch and install it.
B00LV3KCVC|5|Great
B00FH8P1DG|4|BEWARE ALL JEEP WRANGLER OWNERS:  really like the light bar its super bright and works awesome.... BEWARE ALL JEEP WRANGLER OWNERS: if you have a soft top on your jeep and don't like it being loud when driving don't get a light bar... i am taking mine off because it puts off so much turbulence that causes the top to flap around so much it seems like its gonna rip right off the jeep. i have a 2013 jeep wrangler jk
B00DWKRZ4Y|1|This just smeared dust.
B003VLBPJA|3|delivered as expected.  quality item.  like it, but it holes expands to approx 6 inch wholes and is too large for what I needed it for.
B00T6JG5HS|5|If you have a bad back like I do but you still want to ride a sportsbike you must buy these risers.  Extremely easy install.
B007JG1W1E|5|Good quick easy product to use for grey tanks use in between my monthly cascade liquid dish soap and hot water soaking and flush for grease slim and sensor cleaning
B005C5FV7K|5|&#34;WOW&#34; this tip looks very sharp! a perfect fit too BUY IT!!!
B004FO5P1Q|5|It arrived as described
B006SRAJK0|5|thanks
B00F8SISV2|5|Easy to install, looks nice. Does not hide the license plate.
B00DJ7OGBA|3|Looks nice but the cross drilled &#34;breather&#34; hole was horrid.  Tubing with a non-check valve top on it.  That is it.  Cheap and, well, cheap.  As long as you don't fall over it should not be an issue.
B000WJYZFA|5|Yuasa is the gold standard for motorcycle batteries.  A friend who is a battery expert advised against cheap imitations as they don't last.  The date code can't be deciphered by ordinary mortals, but Yuasa will gladly do it over the phone.  The battery I bought was a year old, and it should have been charged at six months, but I had no way of knowing whether this had been done.  However, it has performed well for over a month in my Honda CBR929RR, so I don't expect any problems.  If you buy one check the date and be sure it reads at least 12.4 volts when you get it.
B00HKTMQQ0|1|It was too soft so gave no support and the bumps which were supposed to stimulate or something were irritating.  It was terrible.  Used it about twice and threw it out.  Not worth the postage.
B00SIDVINO|1|Did not work.  Can start the car, but does not open side or back hatch, or unlock doors.
B00429NKWK|4|As described, good value
B000NTE6LW|5|Fit and installation were perfect and easy.
B00826OVWW|5|Great Product and Great Price!!
B00J6D244W|5|I love POR 15 . This is the best stuff ever and never disappoints .
B00XCLLHCY|5|Awesome
B000IYQKZ2|5|Totally worth every penny!
B00Q3SHJ1G|5|Its something you will like to have
B00IUWLZMW|5|Perfect for my 2010 Vulcan 900.<br /><br />At just a few more dollars than a standard motorcycle battery, this one really shines.<br /><br />I was interested in it only for the low voltage alarm after having another battery die on me 100 miles from civilization.  A bonus is having the day clock, letting you know how long it's been in service.<br /><br />The terminal screws should have been about an 1/16&#34; longer, but other than that, this is a perfect battery.
B00QN89JNM|5|Really like the plate. Cute.
B009995MTC|5|Ha!Ha!Ha!  This was great.  Fantastic item for playing a prank on someone.  Magnetic factor holds well, will not come off vehicle easy.
B0048ECFSO|5|nice fit
B00NBTGCF4|5|Wow! As I mounted my 18&#34; x8.5 rear tires on my stand on mower , I tore the bead significantly. I thought there was no chance and that tubes would be necessary. I just opened this can for the first time and amazing sat the  beads w/o leaks !!!!
B000XBCURW|5|Great product. Will not use anything else.
B004Y18GKM|5|This pump worked perfectly fine for my wheels and my forks!<br />I keep it in one of my bags on my bike.
B00873J0YY|4|Product ok, some rust.
B006NZTZLQ|2|Dissapointed with the information I can read.<br />Will connect with my smartphone no problem, just wished I could read more information with it.<br /><br />Don't know if it's the car or the reader, but from what is advertised it falls short...
B002V94NQK|4|It works well so far.
B007BZHSDO|5|Fits well
B00C306A90|5|Great product I would buy it again.
B000CFU4PO|5|high quality as expected from arp
B000AP6RD4|5|great product!
B009B8V4LQ|5|This is very easy to use and makes a big difference in the temperature of the cabin. Great quality and perfect fit.
B00YMTGEZA|5|Man was it hard to get the old one out,put the new one in and  engine light gone
B00PBO0Z3M|5|These were perfect!  I have tried several other products to de-fog my Silverado headlights. Worked for a while, but the fog always returned. Finally decided to just replace them. This set fit perfectly and even came with light bulbs.  Wish I had found these years ago!!!
B006H859DM|4|it fits
B00BSGLBQW|5|these were a great add
B00GSAUHB8|5|folds up and stores easily
B005NLQAHS|4|Saves $$$,  you can troubleshoot your own issues and clear engine lights.
B001DRNNTO|5|great filter great price
B005N6WG1M|5|Very beautiful design and arrived on time-fits to size and received many compliments!
B006FXGR7Q|5|The product comes in bigger size than the actual fog lights lens perimeter. Meaning you will have to cut it custom fit which might seem pain at first, but later realizing it would be much harder to align if the films were precut specifically for the lens. I applied it to the lens at first starting from the center outwards using firm pressure pushing it outwards with no air bubbles using hairdryer for adhesive to stick and then cutting it at the outer edges where film touch the outer ring frame. I did cut more than necessary exposing part of the lens but since the fogs are at the very bottom and hard to spot, it doesnt matter. Regarding the color change (i got the blue films) when I turn the fog lights on, its hard to tell it makes the difference, although I think it does turn the light a little bit &#34;cooler&#34; than without the films. Im happy with them mainly because one of the lens is cracked to point it has hole in it and this serves as a blocker from getting the water and dirt in, and since the crack was 1/4 inch from the edge I worried it wouldnt stick and bend in from air pushing on it. To my surprise, it sticks well and looks perfectly straight and tight on tiny piece of lens at the edge. I can tell its a quality product and maybe the application for such purposes do require hairdryer heat. Im happy with the product and sellers service.
B00HAG66D2|3|Product is fine... I do however have a problem with being over-charged for the shipping.
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Perfect fit in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited (4 door)
B008B666X0|4|Fit like a glove and way cheaper than my mechanic could have gotten it for.
B005MKR7CC|5|it fit fine and looks good...was in good shape
B005JPJMI2|5|amazing!
B000NPNXOW|1|doesn't seem to be working at all...
B000CGHZ14|5|Fuel pump went in perfectly. No problems since install approx. 6 months ago.
B004986ZTO|5|Awesome product! Everything I needed!
B00E70A1OO|5|I was skeptical at first having had a bad experience with a HVLP gun. But using this gun put a smile on my face. Easy to adjust and the paint atomized so well the paint was flow was flat and gorgeous. I painted my brothers 56 Olds two tone and he is very happy with the results since I am not a professional. But the job looked that way. Done in hot rod flatz.
B0041TOQ92|5|Fits great, right price
B00B2AEFK8|4|They work grate.
B001C6Q8D4|5|Wow saved me a bunch of money easy fix to fuel leak my 2002 f250 power stroke is back in business
B006B376WK|5|Small and easy to use on the dash.
B0018YE9EK|5|So far so good, lets see how long it takes before it warps. If it lasts a while I will come back and update the review. Used for tacoma prerunner this is a 6 lug model
B0042HDM6G|5|Worked great, plugged it in and was good to go
B002GI424O|5|I used 9 quarts Eneos Eco ATF to perform a full flush and full service (filter kit) and it fixed the issue I was having with transmission. While driving in traffic I felt the gears kind of drag or jolting slightly during up shifts mainly between 3rd-4th and even at 2nd-3rd gear. The factory fluid which is not full synthetic costs as much this quality made fluid. This was used on a 08 Mazda 3.
B003BFTUNY|4|all the small parts you need to do it right, CD isn't what it could be. Only reason for 4 stars... be like one of the instructional videos on U tube.
B00AYXM4DY|5|I bought this thinking it wouldn't work but I was wrong! It made my car look new this product really works.
B00GBQ1VA0|5|Fits great in my 09 Scion xB.
B000FW2NU8|5|Great tire iron for all vehicles
B004X71H1C|5|Nice product.
B002ZTGLFC|5|The line seems to be holding up just fine. Not too stiff to install.  Holds good seals though
B00WA4AMFC|5|These mats fit my 2015 Prius Two perfectly.
B00WW28T16|2|Could barely tell my brake lights were on vs. parking lights
B0014YG85W|5|Had to return this item because it did not fit my truck as stated. They look nice, and the return process was a breeze. Can't leave a negative review because of Amazon's faults however.
B002J7O7TC|5|Works great!
B00IUV7PFO|1|Wasn't what I thought it was and then told I couldn't return it.
B00NTPSLZ4|4|I ordered two and use as additional lighting for rear of truck. Sturdy construction, easy mounting. No issues with moisture after several weeks. I would recommend.
B00C88AA52|5|Perfect
B00CFPMW90|4|I've been using it for a few hours now and I have to say, it looks great. Only reason for 4 stars is if you don't have a new muffler it doesn't blend well. It adds a small subtle rumble if revved to about 3,000 rpm then let off.
B00KPOFH22|5|great for hot weather
B00SI37WWU|1|I have to have it program by a dealer or lock Smith when I bought it I thought that I would be able to program it I had bought it for a 2010 Malibu and I could not find any information to program it because of it being for a 2010 Chevy Malibu but the price for it was right I have found a lock Smith that will program it for  $45.00
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|perfect!, saves battery in trailer big time. good light, similar to OEM color
B00XXOP4RE|5|I like it it's accurate. I will be taking my first trip in my RV this weekend.. it's a 15k pound allegro.. so far so good.
B005FK81A6|5|This is a great deal. I put these on a 2002 Honda Civic that was shaking terribly when you hit brakes. I knew it needed rotors and pads. I called around to the local auto parts stores and this was by far the best deal. I got an even better deal because I bought an &#34;open box item&#34; on Amazon and it showed up flawless. I feel like I stole these pads and rotors honestly.<br /><br />It's been about 3 months and there have been no issues. This is a great kit and I highly recommend this. Also, I did the brakes myself, I have experience doing brakes so I thought it was easy. But if you don't know how to do the brakes try it out YouTube the directions, save some money.
B00MTHPAN4|1|these pos make your tires go flat.
B00BQ9KDEW|2|NO protection, stay away!
B001W38484|5|great quality good seller
B0032I9VK2|2|hard to breathe with this thing on.
B0013T7OL0|1|Smelled so bad.The fumes coming from them gave me a soar throat.  I sprayed them with vinegar, that didn't work. I washed them in my washing machine with vinegar, detergent and rinsed with baking soda then dried them in dryer. They still had that smell about them. I doused them with baking soda and put them in a plastic bag hoping to get rid of the smell.They don't smell as bad as they originally did but if put in an enclosed space which heats up I don't think I could take it. It was a wast of money. I would send them back but after doing all the above I don't think they are returnable. I have a friend that bought  these (this is why I bought mine) and her's do not smell like mine.
B0002U2V1Y|4|Ran out of the spray on my first clay bar, but it works well and the microfiber that comes with it is better than most you can buy.
B00N18LXJ0|1|Items was broken when received
B000VJLANG|5|Recommended by Edlebrock for use in cam change. Very happy.
B00JE5ZING|5|The helmet is beautiful, just what I wanted without breaking the bank. Listen to the other reviewers! Go a size smaller. Based on the sizing chart, I was supposed to be a Large, but ordered a Medium instead. Fits perfectly! I am extremely happy with my purchase!!!
B00N18LXJ0|4|Looks and works O.K. , although the clip that holds it onto the visor is very large.
B00DZOTVCQ|1|Does what it says, tank protector, but picture is deceiving. Looks to be grip tape rough finish but is shiny, glossy smooth.
B00HNP91VO|5|NICE LIGHT, FAST SHIPPER, A+
B00KTI0D96|5|Best price on the market glad I found them other than having to pay a arm and leg this was a great deal thank you
B0002MBBIQ|5|Worked well.  It took some time to get them to work properly but when I did they work well.
B001TO4WCS|5|does the job well made
B0016KABFC|2|Bolt pattern doesn't fit some common trailers. Strap is cheap and thin. Hook on strap doesn't fit common loop on boat bow.
B00EEMJBYQ|5|Grandson loves it!
B008OYBA7Q|5|fits perfectly.
B000C7ZOHU|5|The XJ Cherokees up to 96 have bad wiring from the factory (examples include the headlight wiring that dims over time, the small battery wires that corrode and reduce performance over time, and the engine ground straps). Another area that used terrible wire choice was the HVAC system. The blower motor ages over time and the aged bearing causes an increased draw of power. This eventually leads to the Blower Switch overheating and essentially melting itself and rendering the whole system useless.<br /><br />This switch is a band-aid fix to the real problem (the blower motor) but has brought my HVAC system back online for the time being. It is nice having AC and a fan in my Cherokee again!<br /><br />To perform a real repair of the issue, one would have to replace the blower motor, the blower motor resistor, this switch and likely some of the wiring would have to be upgraded to the next larger wire size. For now, this will have to do!
B00M1Y3NU2|5|Best price found on Mercon V.
B00NGHM1NI|5|works great
B0002SRH5G|5|one of the best tools you can get for filling automotive cooling systems- you wont have air pockets when using this
B000KZ0Q7W|3|Remote works but looks and feels very generic compared to the factory remote.
B0001CMUV4|4|Works exactly as intended. Protruding threads tend to get caught on things -- as they are the lowest point. Considering flipping upside down.
B00GFW6WYU|5|A+, fast delivery
B00NFSNAS8|5|Came on time from seller, needed it for my boat trailer tires, works great.
B00Q7HV6NA|1|Poor light quality did not work
B00AWDNOZ8|5|Love it.. Love anything to do with Duck Commander.
B001R5VVTQ|5|This is a great cable lock. I use it all the time to secure my cat drop trap. Works great and gives you plenty of cable to work with. Would recommend this product!
B009QT1KLO|5|Expensive but without the ethanol it keeps my small engines running longer
B0015PTTZ6|5|Great fit, very bright. Really happy with the quality. 1995 GMC Yukon
B00DE95B58|5|Worked for my 99 vw beetle :)
B0018C85VK|4|easy to install, works great for the money and not having to use your head. (get it), cant beat it
B002PQOE7M|5|Great bright lights, big difference. Quality item.
B00GCUJWEM|1|Was not a good fit
B000H0QRFK|3|Bright but still yellow. I was hoping for something closer to white
B00HETCUMQ|4|It seems to be working fin I really wanted a 50mm but40 was the I could find. It looks great
B007TY21G6|5|Just installed this assembly to replace a motor only I bought at an auto parts store. Not only this was cheaper but unlike the motor this was stupid easy!
B00O0D9PJ0|1|These did not fit the models listed.  Refund was prompt
B00OO2LNEM|1|Didn't fix my car
B00KTHY91K|5|I spent a few minutes to program the this keyless  fob for my Toyota Camry. This was very easy to program and works perfectly.
B001PVMVTQ|5|These were for a 2005 fx35, and fit perfectly!  I have had these on several cars, much better than the in-track type.  These are the first 'low profile', which look excellent since this is a sporty looking car.  I did not put on the small pieces for the far rear windows (I put on 4, this was a 6 piece set with small visors for the far rear windows).  I thought they looked a little silly and those little windows don't open anyway.
B00GJ1HUB6|5|I was very happy with my purchase, it was delivered two days before I expected it to arrive
B007EDUF8I|5|Easy to install, fits nicely, zipper back compatment that I didn't even know about. GREAT product!
B008RRX370|1|Installed and it didn't even work ordered one from another company worked just fine
B00CHT6K8I|5|Awesome jacket for HOT weather riding.
B001DF9PSY|5|I use K n N  on all my vehicles.Improved performance  and saves on fuel.
B008VOMIIE|3|ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!! But...when driving highway speeds the attached wings, fighting with the wind speeds, really bend the antenna which concerns me.  I will not return them because they are so cute but I think I will cut down the wings in an attempt to cut down on the bending issue.
B00FYX2WEU|3|product difficult to install
B00EA9K2X2|4|I like everything about this except that it does not arrive with screws. What's up with that???
B006WBRU4U|5|Thought about making my own bracket for my 2007 600 Mule, glad I didn't . This bracket fit perfectly and installed quickly! Shipment was fast and earlier than I expected. That is one reason I shop at Amazon! 5 stars this time!
B000630IBC|5|Classic look and old-school styling. Just what I was looking for. Engine is much louder without the intake silencer too.
B0085OJX1U|4|Very cute.  Had it for over 3 months and no scratches.  Has a little weight to it. Very happy.
B0033WNNR4|5|Very easy to do,,good fit
B00YX6146Q|1|Part did not fit.
B007QBR5TA|4|This part fit my 1999 GMC Sierra 1500 5.3 vortex V8. I followed an video off of Youtube and the replacement was pretty easy, getting the serpentine belt back on was the only challenge. It wouldn't hurt to have another set of hands for that.The part was in good shape when I got it.
B00AM24Y94|5|good product
B009BF9S4E|4|Monitors all ten tire pressures when towing with my motor home.
B0029XCR2A|5|NICE
B00913P4E4|1|Disappointed in fit and did not have a provision for pull down armrest. Would not recommend.
B000B8LKZ0|5|Excelent and fast delivery
B0009MZI4M|4|This actually stopped the leak the Camper's black tank had.
B000C2G85W|5|I am happy that it was there,,it has a coating on it that make it nesccessary to use.......Thank you
B008MCCU1U|5|Good A+
B000UV8FRE|2|Very disappointed. These lights look more white than pink. I know LED'S are brighter which can affect the color but not that much. My dome lights are pinkish purple LED'S and these lights don't match at all. Look nothing like the picture shown. I was pretty excited for them to arrive making the dissapointment that much worse.
B00NT5VOIA|4|I was able to put over the old one and it is working every will a little clothie didn't think it would work as well as it did and my car look good
B00OU1P514|5|Semper Fi
B00AC5S23U|1|I've only had it for a few days in my car and the head of it just fell off today. It wasn't even put on good. It looks like it was just poorly glued on. Stitch is my favorite Disney character. So imagine the feeling of seeing his head just fall off.
B000P17NXQ|5|Today is the first  day I have used it. So far, so good.
B00WL5RO3S|5|perfect product
B0038B236M|4|You will still have the problem with hyper flashing but everything else is fantastic the lights are very bright extremely bright but it's too bad that didn't have bottom life the only lights that do light up are the top ones
B006FNKT7K|5|Arrived quickly and applied easily (without any bubbles).
B004A1UNQ6|5|Excellent product and service!
B00FKAMDYG|4|Three wheel covers look splendid on the van, however, one wheel cover snap, evidently, broke off during application to the wheel, and, consequently, the wheel cover was lost on the road somewhere.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Way better that those cheap sets on Ebay.  Actually bought one off Ebay and returned it.  They would not fit correctly.  These fit exactly and had no trouble installing them.
B004PQOT8Y|5|I put this on my 1979 GS 1000L cafe and it fell like Im on a sport bike ..
B00YBFUJ42|5|Smells great! Turns waste into water in no time! Of course we put no paper into our holding tank but it removes all odors!
B00V56U28I|1|Didnt work.
B009KTAZF2|2|A little small for me
B00FPTMFUY|5|love it
B00KPWB1KQ|4|Had trouble with the self tapping bolts,  the bolts that were included kept stripping out so I had to buy some new ones to use... other then that they fit like a glove and look great !!!
B00JL6MWIW|5|They're sharp looking, though the manufacturer had the boxes labeled backwards.  Luckily, my mechanic husband figured it out & they look just awesome on his truck!
B000OV7IE6|3|A little weak . Will not hold a load the winch is rated for.
B000CMJS6I|3|I'm sure these connectors would work great with newer wire but if your wire has lost it's pliability forget these as an option. The wires will not stay after being compressed into the connector. If the wire terminators were a slightly thicker guage they may work better.
B002E4ZIR0|5|Exact fit working well
B00823FSRC|4|Works great.  There is a learning curve for strapping kayak on, but I haul it some distance over a rough dirt trail to water, and have no real problems.
B00BI2APMW|5|Works as stated and for the price it is hard to beat
B000TRJM5I|5|Grate
B003SU0XM4|5|Got this to use at the lake. Husband loves it, but the neighbor's don't (Vikings fans, lol). So far it has held up well under the sun and wind
B000A09MCW|5|Beats paying dealer $60! And that's their SPECIAL! Watch the YouTube video----it's easy.
B0040IV0Y8|1|Mine fell off make sure you put it on right
B000B8WDEW|3|Looks good! I'm waiting to see if the clear plastic area over the Harley Davidson will bubble or discolor in the sun. Looks good so far after a month and a few car washes.
B00JCHCQVI|4|all good.
B0042KJV9U|5|Worked as advertised, very good product with a good price!
B00VDQL84M|5|Had no problems with this product! Made the job easy!
B0049CGLH6|5|It works very well. it raised my trailer to the right height above the bed of my truck.
B000C92RDC|5|Hard to find at a decent price. Quick delivery and great price.
B002RSIK4G|5|Used to &#34;belt and suspenders&#34; seal the edges of an RV roof instead of messing around with Dicor every six months.  So far, so good.
B000BYD3RC|5|Direct fit. Worked great.
B00439FE9G|4|was what I needed
B003U56R68|4|exact fit
B009XUZD46|3|I think it would probably have been great, but unfortunately it was destroyed in a car accident before I had a chance to install it.  I never even had a chance to use it.  I will have to get another, and hope that this one makes the trip.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Love em. Very bright. Have recommended to friends.
B001N2V6Y8|5|We have used a jet stage two piggyback chip on our highly modified jeep with tire smoking success.  Jet seems to make a great product JET 80025 is a stage one chip that plugs into the factory ford ECU diagnostic port not the OBDII port.  It does require modifying the ECU holding bracket on the firewall behind your emergency brake release.  Ours arrived already opened and looked used, not what we would expect prime direct without third party vendors.  We can't chance modifying the ECU board and bracket to install an opened and potentially used electrical product.  Minor setback, we plan to get another one, we just are not sure how to get a new unopened unit.
B00LNM6Y68|5|Very well made
B00DGZI116|5|This battery was exactly what I needed in terms of size, voltage, and style of connectors.  The price absolutely was fair, and shipping was prompt.  I am quite well satisfied with this product.  Thank you, Mighty Max.
B00332GMKY|3|good product but hard to apply
B00GXRFLY4|1|This order received Jun 2016 is Not 365 GSM!  These rags supplied by Amazon are Considerably Thinner (Cheaper) Dual-Pile Material than the same Purplenality rags I received directly from The Rag Company a couple weeks ago which are genuine Korean microfiber 365gsm. The difference felt in materials is like night and day!
B0062A7M2G|5|Great stuff, super strong when warmed up with a hair dryer, stretch and apply looks great in my truck on my console
B00AYXM4DY|5|AS ANYTHING, NOTHING IS PERFECTION! (EXCEPT MY WIFE,LOL); BUT SINCERELY, THIS PRODUCT BEATS THE HE** OUT OF EVERY THING ELSE OUT THERE FOR THIS SAME PURPOSE. I'VE HAD IT ON MY 2011 EXPRESS VAN FOR 5 MONTHS NOW AND IT'S STILL DOING THE JOB! AND YES, IT WORKS ON TIRES. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PER OUNCE FOR THE PRICE CHARGED.
B000CMH9HI|3|The item has the incorrect picture and is indeed for the steering column. I installed it anyway since I didn't want to wait for an a-pillar pod. Not a huge deal but this image is totally 100% incorrect.
B00V7E4E7I|1|All the letter &#34;E&#34; didn't print right and won't come off the sticker part.
B00CMR79H6|5|Good quality rubber.  Matches the Mopar slush mats from the front floor.  Was able to trim the lower right corner along the provided cut line to accommodate my factory subwoofer.
B000C9QU5I|1|Item was defective, received a refund.
B00412YT8W|5|Fits and functions the same as the original equipment.
B00QNUO7FK|5|The Rag Company is a great mid USA business.  They sell a wide range of towels.. You gotta check out their 20 x 40 &#34;Avalanch&#34;  A super plush snow white most incredible water absorbing auto drying towel I've used in 30yrs !
B00LPIA3T4|5|I bought this to fix my Beats Wireless Headphones. Loved it.
B000GU3EB6|5|Totally Awesome I thought I would never find a pair of goggles that fit over my glasses and allow me to see clearly
B007TYL3CE|5|Excellent replacement at a good value. Well packaged & perfect fit. Thanks!
B001FIK0D8|5|Been on 2 months no problems
B00PLIYJSK|4|very bright than HID and are a good purchase
B00NHZIFKM|5|As stated very fast service
B0002PE4YQ|3|It's okay, not as powerful as toted. Not disappointed ,but if I was to get another, would probably give another one a try.
B000CP89ZG|5|Works as advertised
B007FR1FT6|5|This rebuild saved me bundles and was so easy to do. One hour and I had a new starter.
B00Y8T4BAO|3|Good seats if your real small frame,these are tighter than my sparco sprint jr seats i used to race in. Its so tight on my hips im actually going to take the seat bottom apart and bend out the side bottom supports and reassemble. The sliders are much better than others i've seen in this price range. There is no forward tilt lever besides the seat back adjustment. So anytime you fold the seats forwards you will lose your seat adjustment.
B007FHMAHM|5|Works great! And quick delivery!
B003D3TKNY|5|great for keeping organized when camping.
B00063X38M|5|Wonderful glu.  Was recommended by a dealer.
B00BCRMA9Y|2|Even though these said they fit my Prius they didn't.  They fell apart fast also
B00WGX5LFS|1|I ordered these headlight assembly's and 4 months later one side has began to fade and hold moisture I was very unsatisfied with the product and emailed the seller to see what could be done about the problem and the response from the seller was &#34;I'm sorry there is nothing we can do&#34; I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone.
B00HSFARG2|5|Fits great, right price.
B00REDDYSQ|3|The quality is very good and looks great but it is a completely different shade of yellow looks very light and nothing like the picture.
B00E1L72RS|5|Love these shades! Fit perfectly on my 2009 Jeep Patriot front windows.  I don't even need the suction cups included.
B00TF8G25U|4|Did not fit my Suzuki LTZ 250 seat but seemed to be nice quality.
B008PO635Y|5|I brought the stuff over a year ago and used it for the second time todayand the performance is always great and meets expectation
B007XUIKZC|5|Great just what i expected
B00KOYVZ4C|5|Absolutely loveeeeeeeeeee it!
B004PQHTIG|5|As expected<br />Fast arrival. Good price!
B00G668RZM|5|works as advertised
B0049JG4IK|2|This item came on time , however it was much thinner than the original gasket and actually melted down to the metal in a week.
B002IXFC9G|5|Love it
B0049EC4IY|5|I just installed this today on the drivers door of a 2002 Rav4 and it works perfectly!  If it stops working I will update.
B00TQZTV6O|5|very nice my second one
B002P8KRT4|5|fit perfect, went on it less that 15 minute, and it was 5 degree out when it installed it
B00LO0M918|5|Great bargain and seem to be working great
B004GEPSV2|5|Perfectly fit my daughters 2000 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD.  It came complete with light fixture, mounting bracket, and two bulbs.  Super fast shipping and exactly as described.  I would order this product from this vendor again.
B004A2YEUQ|5|Great product at a great price. Truck drives like when I first got it.
B000AXE7DI|5|I love it
B00CZG8YR8|2|Really expected more with how positive the reviews are on these. I started replacing all the lights in a camper I just bought that I am starting to freshen up and update the inside. From the moment I wired up the first one and turned it on I knew I wasn't very impressed, it wasn't even brighter than the old incandescent it replaced. I decided that I should replace at least 6 to make a better decision since that's how many I ordered. I wired all 6 in the living area and turned them all on and still want happy, for the extra money spent it seemed like a downgrade. I immediatly started looking for other brands and found there is not much selection on amazon with more Lumens in this price range. Luckily I stumbled across etrailer.com and they offer a similar light from optronics with over double the lumen output for about a dollar cheaper per light. I picked them up and replaced all the goldstars and I am now very satisfied, they are what I expected in the first place. I tried to take the best pics I could but pictures really don't do them justice. The color was much closer to the incandescent and what I consider just right, the goldstars almost had a greenish tint to them. Hope this helps other get the most bang for their buck. I would say this is one of only a couple products I have ever went through the trouble of returning because I was unsatisfied and the first time something with this high of a review rating dissapointed.
B00K6DN2YM|5|These Nerf bars are sharp and go on really easy. They are a few bucks more than the normal ones you see on every truck, but they are definitely different & look high quality & custom made.
B0034NHD5K|5|good quality, i used it in a cold weather and served me well
B008QR1ASK|5|good towels for the price... I will buy more in the future
B000765MHI|4|holy crap, wow this thing is powerful, but LOUD LOUD LOUD with a capital LLL.. so you need to move some air, perhaps you need to lift a blimp quickly into the air, perhaps you want to see a basset hound hanging his head of a car look, this is the item for you.<br /><br />the clamp is awesome, points for this.<br /><br />the variable speed controller does work well.<br /><br />but unless you turn it way way down this thing is LOUD.<br /><br />I notice in large cities people sometimes crossing the street get too close to your car, aim this at them, they will either be pushed away by the torrent of air, or they will run thinking that an air raid is underway.<br /><br />all of this being said, it moves some AIR
B0012RN36I|2|dID NOT WORK WITH MY 2005 VENTURE WITH TOWING PACKAGE.
B00GUDCVN0|5|I have a 2007 Suburban and the power lift gate stopped working, I could hear a motor trying but no lift. After some research to see if it was the motor or latch, I felt good enough to take a chance and start with the latch. The latch is easily accessible by removing the screw in the handle on the hatch and pulling down gently on the plastic hatch cover (I didn't have to take the entire cover off, just enough to access the latch) . Three screws removed from the old latch, pop off harness, put new latch in and everything back together. Crossed my fingers while I hit the liftgate button and felt joy as I watched the liftgate automatically shut! Total install was about 5 minutes and have a functional power liftgate again. Very happy with purchase! Not so with GM quality though :)
B00P17H1JU|5|The product was received in great shape. The installation went well, but it takes some patience to install. It is a little like applying tint to glass. The product looks great on the vehicle.
B005XK04MQ|5|If you have an umbrella in your backyard table this thing is a must! It helps it stop swinging around and making me think the glass is going to break every time the wind blows. Seems like it fits most sizes since its tapered. Good quality I have had it out since I bought it and still looks brand new. Definitely worth the money!
B0002NUNX4|5|Awesome product. Very good compliment to the DA sander. Uses the same discs, has a good feel to it and really help when sanding around corners etc. Worth every penny!
B001G7DEDQ|5|Worked like new. The old ones get brittle
B00D3ZG1WK|5|This item dropped my stock ride and eliminated fender gap. I updated the shocks with KYB's at the four corners. Added sway bars and upper strut tower brace. I asked to have my alignment checked and was told everything came together nicely and it was not needed. Surprised me! The car dropped 2 inches. The ride change remains comfortable. Body roll significantly reduced. Many different combinations out there, but my combo featured Tein S Tech lowering springs, Suspension Techniques front and rear sway bars and Mopar strut tower brace. I grin from ear to ear when driving includes turns and straightaways. Awesome handling and sporty, comfortable ride. Buy now
B004HE0B8Q|1|This was the wrong part. I will not buy this part anymore.
B002YKHRUK|5|I work as a small engine mechanic, and use these almost every other day. And they work better than anything else used for this purpose. I didn't quite want to spend $9 on them, but after I got them, I can see why. They're build pretty nice, but the purpose they serve, is well worth it. And they're small, so you don't have to worry about a pair of vice grips handing around your work area
B007EEVMPW|5|it worked great, thanks
B0007ZG9U8|4|Worked great thanks ++++
B004GE1KNM|5|Fit perfectly.
B00CJCS1V2|1|Mine worked fine for about 2 minutes at which point the plastic would melt off and the fuses would stop working then it me a while to pull the rest of it out of my amp, and its only 1000w max. they did not work for me, they would always just melt then blow, my previous one did not do that and they were still 30 amp, these are just made super cheap.
B010HFROCO|5|excellent product installed with no problem
B0085FOFXU|5|Great headlights, look awesome on my black grille!!!
B000CEBM6U|5|nice plate for the price.
B00M3X78ZM|1|No it didn't work at all
B00HVHVIUG|5|The item fits the key fob perfectly and prevents scratches and accidental button pushes.
B000CSNO62|5|If you drive a Ford Model T, this is the plug to use.  Has the advantage of a crimp over the porcelain insulator as opposed to the Champion take-apart 'X' plug.  My car is driven very often and these are the only plugs I've used for years.  Great longevity.  Burn clean.
B002X6VXL4|5|We use it on people we don't like. Works great.
B002UC4UV6|5|Worked exactly as described.
B00G2114IS|4|Look nice. Seem heavy duty. Very small logo, but then again, how big can it be on a valve stem cap.
B00860LYCE|5|I never thought a magnetic tank bag would stick like crazy glue.  This think will not fall off your bike, ever.  It is big enough to fit quite a number of needed objects.
B00TECA190|3|Not that happy it came with the a.c. and powersteeing pulleys all together and I have neither 😠 but it's still light well more light than the stock one.
B001GG29QK|5|very cute.  just as pictured.  A+
B002QGVW3K|4|buen producto!!
B00NBT4774|5|Easy to apply and very cute
B000ALG86E|1|Didn't realize I couldn't use it on a recently painted vehicle.
B00ZSGKPOM|1|Did not fit my Saturn vue like they said they would. Very baggy and loose.
B00LAEXEYE|5|Good product
B002VVG04Q|5|Part installed easily and seems to work well.
B0009H51VM|5|I am always doing upgrades to my civic. I am saving to put a short ram intake in it, so in the meantime I was looking to replace my old filter. This added substantial more flow to the engine and it is quite noticeable. I would say this is one of the best panel air filters!
B0063CTU5A|5|Good fit
B00QL0Z3Q4|5|This car decal is awesome!
B0036C0PVI|2|Save money buy painters tape.
B002J7KE4E|5|great product!
B00P1N8QU2|5|great product!
B007FHHEVO|3|OK product. Works well. Looks really good at night. During the day very hard to see because of the suns glare.
B00FQ8U0YM|5|I bought these thinking they would protect the black plastic part of the door sill that's always getting scuffed up from shoes. After realizing it goes on the actual outside of the door sill where the paint of the car is, I got over it and actually love them. It looks more classy and definitely adds to the car. They are a lot smaller than I expected but fit perfect and I am very happy with my purchase, worth it.
B008A7U13G|5|Excellent product
B006H7BQCG|3|Small, mold lines are pronounced, not shown in image in the listing.  Not as shiny as pictured.  Would buy the larger one next time.
B001PGWXJO|2|Not as powerful as I expected. AS one  review stated  cable can get tangled up.  Must  be careful to keep this from happening.<br />With previous winches I have owned this did not happen and was not a problem.<br />I would advise anyone buying this winch to be very careful and try to avoid this happening.
B0067PUMXW|5|Really cool- put it on the windshield of my red Trans Am!
B00G5KII76|4|Worked as advertised.
B009AEGNA8|5|All that, plus! Fit the steering wheel perfectly. Very comforting to my hands and fingers. I love it! thinking about ordering one for family members.
B00B8XK5RG|5|This item is nescecary for my car to run smoothly,,,,,,,,Thank you
B003BG9XDK|4|Fits well. Does a good job but bulky to store because it doesn't fold up like others
B000C9VWRE|5|Excelent parts and delivery
B00JXZJWUC|4|Good product
B00HPTLOIQ|5|Worked like a pro!
B00PV37ZEA|4|So far so good! Seems durable and leakproof. Using it for a week and it's been fine so far!
B000CNAT3S|5|It had what I needed and a lot more.
B00L8FMI7O|5|These are very close to the look and feel of the oem's. They are almost identical and perform very well. Extremely easy to install. These are cheap enough to even buy for someone who wants to keep their originals fresh and un-faded/damaged. I would definitely go for these on a race bike to save the originals.
B00AZ4QAY6|2|Would be a higher rating if the rear guards would fit(allow the popout windows to open), which is the whole point.....
B00H8KVO8M|3|This unit reads .2v low.  It may not seem like much but if you're using this to monitor a 12v RV, or trolling motor, battery you're going to think you have considerably less battery left than you do.  I mistakenly thought the circuit board had a calibration control.  It doesn't.  If you don't need high accuracy, this is certainly a good buy for the price.
B002FDMFRQ|1|Just buy a feeler gauge instead. This thing sliced my finger open.
B0063J9I5K|5|good
B0031WGQBQ|1|Had to replace twice with in a month it tore very very easily . At the end of the day you get what you Pay for. My other jeep has had the nx top for years no issues
B001JEIHAG|4|Does its job of keeping the seat belt from cutting my neck. Only down fall is it doesn't allow the seat beat to retract leaving it in the path of the door if not paying attention.
B003RQBKLC|5|Awesome
B00449PUD0|4|Looks like a lighter paper element as compared to the original oem filter.  Fits perfect.  Not sure it will last as long as the original.
B000CNHEEA|4|Product is as advertised.  Sounds a little different than expect on my 2013 silverado 5.3.  Non the less, is pretty much what i wanted.
B004XONNTE|4|What I needed for the auxiliary transmission cooler
B005IV0FN8|1|Not bright enough to be useful.  I suppose they would make decent marker lights, but as turn signals.... Nope.
B007A3W0BM|5|This starter fits 2003 to 2008 and maybe more rincon's ?.  I put it on my 2003 and it is a match,  why doesn't the seller know this?.
B00OZ1FQAO|5|The sound is better in person. Good stuff!
B0067EJNBA|5|Great quality at a fair price. Just what I was looking for. Easy installation, fit as advertised. Shipped in a timely manner.
B00BZ3AB8C|4|I have heard NO COMPLAINTS about this part and I would have heard them, too, because my husband thinks I am the complaints department. I would be totally surprised if he has actually used this part, though, because he hasn't worked on the Mustang in a long time. But, it's a Ford part so perhaps he used it for something else. Anyway, it seems to be what he wanted and doing what he wanted because he's staying quiet about it.
B0050QLVS4|4|Gauge seems legit
B001O7PNW8|5|good stuff  reliable seller
B006SA3T90|3|Bought this for my grandma for passover. She doesn't get it.
B00BN468AI|5|Very sturdy design. But you'd expect it to be.
B00DJDYS58|5|Worked great
B00KC39BE6|4|so far it holds the charge very well. its a bit heavy for carrying around but it can go all night with my LED lights when fishing. I will try to power some more items with it simultaneously and see how it does.
B00PT18QAQ|5|I keep this in my truck. Tested it against a few other high dollar ones and it worked just as good. Holds the pressure that you can reset incase you can't see the dial at the angle you test your tire at.
B000EDSSMA|5|It's definitely nice. Not worth the price in my book but I needed something that I was sure was going to fit over the RV stove. Been handy ever since simply because we use an electric stove instead of our gas one.
B011N69SCA|5|Good quality, Exactly as pictured and fits nicely.
B00THHE73I|1|didn't last more than one month ugh
B0009IQXFO|5|love it
B00HZBOPY4|5|PAINT MATCHES WELL ON RAV4 2008 BLACK
B0028SVNZI|5|Perfect fit, little difficult to use. Protection excellent.
B00DE7SM42|5|Excellent product
B00SUTHIVM|5|Just picked 2 of these up and they are great! Just fyi I got them at harbor and freight for 12 bucks.
B00AJYWM62|3|You are basically only paying for the floor mats and steering wheel cover. The seat covers are nothing special the only thing I can think to compare them to are the thin green or gray styrofoam type paper you get in the mail to protect a photo. I guess if they were the right size I would like them more because they aren't noticeable with black interior. I have been using the other stuff for the past 2 months. The mats are not as thick or durable as I hoped. By that I mean they can flip up easily if your foot hits the corner. When the time comes to replace I probably wouldn't order these again mostly because they don't fit my dart. I can't secure them with the hooks that are in my floor with the holes in the corners of the mats because the mats are too narrow.. I would have returned them but I don't really care about that because I like having the logo on the mats more than I care about the fit. So other than that, the steering wheel cover is fine, fits snug and not fading yet.
B0027XEKQ8|4|works good
B000F09CEA|5|Worked great, had a stuck 02 sensor, tried pb blaster (sprayed for two days) with heat didn't work. Used the kroon and the sensor came right out!!
B002N5PNOS|1|It leaks water from around the pull out during filling. Very disappointed and it's hard to believe that someone had design it that way and it made it all the way to production....I wouldn't recommend it, plus made cheaply and it feels like it's about to fall apart when you try to use it.

B002P33KVQ|1|I live off the grid in the Southern California desert and purchased three of these pumps to replace shurflow pumps that I paid $89 for at the local market.  I was impressed with the price and the product reviews.  I used one of the pumps for my whole house pump and the other two on remote water tanks.  I was lucky to get a year on the Shurflow pumps and was looking forward to a better pump.  Long story short, bad decision.  The first pump lasted less than three weeks before it started working intermittently.  I figured I got a bad pump and installed pump number two  it worked for a day before it quit working period.  At this point, Mr. Positivity was feeling not so positive.  On to pump three.  First couple of weeks was good, then it starting operating intermittently as well.  I came home to a dead deep cycle battery and a fried battery tender because of a dead short in pump three.  Pulled the pump off my fifth wheel, a Shurflow, and installed it on my house and promptly ordered two Shurflows from Amazon.  Not in the habit of talking smack about products and won't go through the hassle of returning them.  Just not what I was expecting after all the positive reviews.
B004UPZVSC|1|The Wagan EL2537-5 Twin USB and 12-Volt DC Cup Holder Power Adapter blew the fuse in my 2012 Audi TT for the cigarette lighter and 12 volt charging port within 24 hours of being plugged in and used once with only a detector plugged into one of the sockets and an iphone plugged into one of the USB ports to charge for a brief amount of time. It looked great and fit perfectly but I do not recommend this item as it is cannot be used for more than a few moments before blowing the fuse and become unusable.
B00VRGM9RI|4|I got it I loved it but my fuse has blown  and i accidently got anothor fuse stuck in the fuse shell so I need a new fuse and fuse holder and now I dont know how to contact the seller to get another. need help if you can help please email me at karldeveaux@gmail.com
B00BCRM9RM|3|I have a 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander. It was a little difficult to place ,but the out come was really nice . Exactly like the picture I like it . (wash before use)

B00ELJZN08|2|very good it works well.
B008CE0R5E|4|We haven't used these yet but my whole house stinks and they are still in the box!  They smell like the worst moth balls you have ever smelt.  I put them in another room and my whole house still stinks.  Storing them in the garage until we need them.
B00JLJI648|5|Works fits perfect! Beware of the small amount of oil that will come out when you remove it. I did mine at oil change time so it was warm. Wear eye protection !
B0006MTRJ2|5|Works great...use it outside from tap to garden timer.
B003ZWG6T4|5|very good product
B000BKIGIW|5|Works fine
B000C7ZUF6|5|Works Great !!
B00OCAICC2|5|Great replacement. Actually fit on my 2007 Audi A4. There seems to be a staple towards the back that has been poking towards leather from when I got it causing many pained elbows and arms. The lever that breaks ever so often on the oem armrest breaks just as easily on this. For way less and still mostly identical to oem and even though mine lasted only 4 months I will be repurchasing very soon!
B001P2EYHC|3|Was a Gift for someone.
B00IU95YMM|5|It was exactly what they said it was. No problems at all.

B00074Q2A6|5|Makes a huge difference in stability. I no longer get see sick when I am in the living room and my wife is moving around in the bedroom!<br />Takes a bit to set it up, but I'm sure it will become routine.
B006G6VDQC|1|Installed them on a Friday, and both had burned out by the next Friday. All the wires connecting to these were fried. VERY displeased with your product.
B0002JMF98|5|Great!
B00OL88A04|5|worked fine,no problem,worth the wait for the price.
B00GEIIPY0|5|Worked perfect.. no issues installing

B00P03HO6U|5|Wish I could get more!
B00E0NSL54|5|Best glass cleaner I have ever used. If you use with one of their glass cleaning towels you will have no streaks.
B0007OWD2M|5|I have fallen in love with this stuff. I picked some up at the dollar store the other day when I was cleaning my car. I've tried a bunch of different stuff to get smoke residue off the interior of my windshield. I am thoroughly impressed. I've used a bunch of different window cleaners in the past with no luck. This took care of my problem immediately, I didn't even need to go back over it. Highly recommend it.
B004C0U2SE|5|started my car right up
B000CAVE1W|5|Exact fit working well

B00N44WLXS|5|works Flawlessly . thank you so much
B0049BA30I|1|It's very thin. More like a fabric than a mat. Get a good rubber mat instead
B000BUOSGG|5|Great dish drain for RV or small kitchen
B005JUOG9W|2|Arrived quickly and adds a nice touch to my new vehicle...  Update....Like another customer said, this plate was very nice upon receipt. I bought it last July and it's May and the emblem has faded and, of course, fallen off. Guess I'll fork over 45 dollars at BMW.  You definitely get what you pay for.
B00OU67Z80|1|in the first hour it worked, but after the initial charged, as per instructions, it never worked again. had to return. very disappointed.
B004MA7B9C|4|Good quality.  Have not used extensively yet but did test the ratchet function upon receiving.  Works as advertised. The springs holding the T-handle did not secure it well so I had to bend them but that was easily done.
B00X5GEI5E|5|These look great in my 2015 Subaru Forester. It was a little difficult to get the small chrome trim perfectly lined up with the speakers. Fortunately, the seller included some additional 3M tape with my purchase so I was able to get things exactly right the second time around. Beautiful look when installed.
B00RYPN0SI|4|Worked great
B00VNGOI1W|5|Great price and does a great job charging my motorcycle battery
B00Z8TGR4G|5|This Tailgate light bar is awesome. It is very bright and super easy to install. Will buy again. Please make a fluxbeam bulb that fits a 2014-2015 chevy 1500 fog light. Thanks again OPT7
B00J0UZWYU|5|As another reviewer stated it actually doesn't fit even though amazons fit guide says it does. I own a 1998 Jeep Wrangler but all I had to do like the other person stated, was just file it down to make it fit the electrical plug. It works great and is 10x cheaper than anywhere else so get it it's worth the small effort to fix a common problem. My idle was all over the place and I had check engine code p0320. After putting this in everything works great.
B00480KPLW|3|little difference over stock ones that were 9 years old.
B00MU3LU0Y|5|The product showed up quickly and worked well to bleed my brakes. Very satisfied with it
B00EKW1NEG|5|What a clever idea for a decal! The package arrived promptly and safely. The decal stuck to the wall beautifully. I do wish it were larger, but that is my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. For such an inexpensive item this decal seems high quality. I will order from this company again.
B00MP0M9CA|5|Good quality vinyl sticker

B0041CDPQO|2|Couldn't get it to work with cell phone chargers.
B0051D3MP6|5|Good for my minivan battery maintanence.
B00FXIRHTQ|5|Exactly what I was looking for and they came in handy and already paid themselves off
B000CMH8V0|5|Fits perfect on my truck!  Easy to put on, instructions for the track not included, found an image online that gave me the right idea to install.  Quality is good and overall I'm very happy with it.  (2015 Nissan Frontier Crew cab short bed v6)
B0009IK6SE|5|Just the right part for the job.  Two of the most commonly used tubing size sets for windshield washing  Be sure to keep your existing connectors as this set does not come with them.
B003L35990|5|best oil filter on the market
B00TG24GDU|5|Perfect, just what I expected and wanted!
B0001EVUC2|5|Very nice.
B002VVHRSE|5|outfitted my trailer with 4 of these, and they are great as I can load different bikes in any order and they all fit with just a few quick movements of the adapter.
B000OCBSHI|5|Works perfect!
B002H9CMCQ|5|Very good quality product . Make my truck looks new again
B00PGNMZVI|2|Didn't work on our 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe; unable to get out of first gear.

B00192JGA8|5|Best adaptor I bought, and I have had several.
B00CB8WM2S|5|I honestly had no idea a tool like this exsited until I came across it while browsing Amazon. As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. This is a precautionary tool for me, and thankfully, I haven't had to use it on my own vehicle. Having said that, I wanted to test it out once it arrived, and my father has a few junkers lying around and he allowed me to test it out on the passenger side window. I really expected there to be hesitation and a lot of force needed to break the window, but Tools of Life has made a product that truly works. I hit the window with what I'd call &#34;medium force&#34;, meaning I didn't really exert myself, and to surprise, it shattered that window that a professional baseball player had taken to it. It's my opinion that every family, or anyone, with a car, should HAVE to have one of these. The peace of mind it gives is invaluable. I keep mine in my purse at all times, because my purse is ALWAYS with me. Should there ever be an emergency, I'm covered.
B0039Z3T4C|5|Great product.  Easy to install.  Took the tinny sound out of my speakers. Now the factory speakers sound like high-dollar ones.
B00NF18MIS|5|Excellent, very,very, satisfied
B00W9EBF0Y|4|This little device works great now. I was having trouble setting it up, but after a phone call to the brands customer service they helped me figure it  out. Parking the car is so much easier. Very happy :)
B001449MH8|2|It DOES have the plastic pump cover as shown in my picture, even though the picture in the ad doesn't show this.  I ordered the Sierra 18-3392 from this exact site for my 1979 Johnson 85hp V4.  Everything fit EXCEPT the impeller itself.  It would not fit over the drive shaft with out resorting to a big hammer, (which I DIDN'T) and I could not use the impeller.  I went to a local boating supply shop here in the Seattle area that sold these kits over the counter, and tried a second Sierra impeller of the same part number, and it had the exact same problem - too small to fit over the shaft.  Frustrated, I went to a Johnson/Evinrude dealer and got an OEM impeller - not the entire kit.  It fit perfectly and slid onto the shaft as it should.  It was sufficiently snug, but it was not necessary to hammer it on like the Sierra parts would have required.  I'm very disappointed that two different Sierra impellers didn't fit, and had to buy a Johnson/Evinrude impeller at a significantly higher price - $45 just for the impeller.  I left the Sierra impeller with the dealer since they work the Sierra rep, and they will report my problem.<br /><br />Some notes - I used emery paper to clean and smooth the shaft before trying to fit the Sierra impeller with no success.  It was smooth and free of ridges, etc that would have prevented the Sierra impeller to slide on properly.  Since I tried two of the same Sierra impellers and they both would not fit, and the OEM impeller fit perfectly, I can only conclude that the Sierra parts were not machined properly, and were a few thousands of an inch out of tolerance.  The Johnson/Evinrude dealer mentioned that he has heard of other Sierra parts having tolerance problems, but didn't think it was a widespread problem across all their parts.
B007XE8C74|5|Awesome little piece of kit.
B0069EQT88|5|good product
B000FW7V50|5|Ya can't beat buying in bulk!! Remember to keep at least one original Lucas bottle so you do not &#34;overdose your vehicle&#34; with too much treatment
B000656YNQ|5|It fixed the AC issue on my 1999 Corolla. Now I can select low, med or high instead of running the AC on HIGH only.
B000PGVZ30|5|Good
B00UW09L8U|5|Excellent fit
B00080QHNG|4|good tool
B00PG8UBXC|5|As discribed A+
B00JO9MXDU|5|Great product
B00T3W3FB2|5|Just what I needed.  Works great, well built and the case was a plus.<br />Great price and received very quickly.<br />Will order again.
B009LZTZ2Y|5|Add the title says
B00KCSTVCI|1|Initially I thought it would be somewhat bigger, but this key chain was very smaller than the key and not worth for the price
B000C9CC1E|5|very good product for the price
B0002JN2EU|5|Good price for a quality product with prompt delivery. Will buy from them again.
B00F5MUB66|5|Far exceeded our expectations, an excellent product.  Bought this for the RV, thinking of getting another for home.
B000C9DMAE|3|The Amazon fitment tool says these are an exact fit for a 2006 Silverado with front discs and rear drums.  They are not.  The fronts pads are shaped entirely different and do not fit. The pads do look like those pictured on Amazon for this p/n even though the disclaimer says this is just a representative pic. In the future I will cross reference the GM part number instead of relying on Amazons fitment tool.<br /><br />Packaging - The pieces inside the box were loose and although they arrived ok they very easily could have been banged up during shipment if handled roughly.
B00QJEY14M|5|Part arrived on time and was a perfect fit. Seems to me a quality part
B00ARQY30K|5|Nice large sticker which is easy to read and visible to the cars behind you. I placed the sticker on the back window. My concern was removing it after by daughter completed her driving instruction. Surprisingly, the sticker came off easily in one piece.
B007GLCO3W|1|I am not a fan of this product for one specific reason: while I wanted a wipe that would clean and protect my dashboard area, I did not want it to shine the area so that it was distracting to drive with in sunlight. Some people do want that look; however, it was not what I was looking to achieve. When I use the wipes I can actually see everywhere they have been as an oil is left behind on the surface. Consequently, if you are going to clean one spot, you must clean the entire thing or it looks poor. Again, this may be exactly what some are looking for, but if your preferences are more like mine, I would recommend another product.
B00K9RZZK4|5|Great item and fast delivery!
B00OZZVR9E|5|Easy assembly.  Fit perfectly.
B0026L2M0C|4|its good fluid
B007R4HK3M|5|Real nice .
B000ET525K|5|Works perfect and I would recommend that everyone carry this product with them in their car.
B006N9ETZY|1|plastic instead of metal like the stock ones, got brittle from heat and broke in two months...... absolute junk..DO NOT BUY....
B008AF7640|5|Awesome lights. I've purchased these 3 times, and each use has been successful.  I even used them to put lights on an old John deere 160 that did not have he alight from the factory. I cut out the square slots in the grill, and put the plastic housing behind the grill, and you wouldn't be able to tell they aren't factory. They are super bright on tractors, atvs, and anything small, and I'm assuming they would work just as well on a car/ truck
B00F5QMBK6|5|The order came in super quick. Was not expecting that at all because it came in 2 days before scheduled delivery. Super glad to see it on my front door. I haven't plugged it in yet but it looks quality. It's a universal kit so i have to do some modifications before it'll go in my car
B002ATT0FU|3|it works but not very well.
B00EKTJSIW|5|Looks really good, just as good as factory. It was been through the car wash 4x and no signs of wear or
B006GCWOSC|5|Exactly as pictured and slightly cheaper than buying from the dealership.
B00876OHQ2|5|perfect fit for my 2012 G37s sedan
B00DUL8BSO|4|Great price. Good fit. Does the job.
B00EQQIUGK|5|Easy installation and great performance. Definitely improved throttle response. Appears to have improved smoothness of automatic transmission shifting. It is as if the truck runs smoother.......
B0002LWDU2|5|Top quality, perfect fit, makes a huge difference in interior heat when you park facing the sun. Only wish they came in sizes for the side windows too!
B004AG9ILM|5|I used these to replace all the coils on my '08 E90 335xi. Been driving on them for a few weeks now and I have not experienced any problems.
B00683W092|5|Worked perfectly
B00PV6KTGS|5|This works for 98 legacy and probably most other cars. This is the one on the passenger side that goes under the manifold.
B00HZ31O3W|5|I HAVE NOT USED IT YET, HOWEVER THE QUALITY IT THERE AND I AM SURE IT WILL WORK GREAT WHEN I DO USE IT.
B00CXK4E1Q|3|Did not fit the way the add said,but my car is garaged so it is ok
B008BYQ6ZK|5|Great product.  Very bright.  Only front LEDs on '05 Deluxe, did not need a load equalizer.
B006JJ7BXU|2|Looks great but stopped working after one season.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Reception on this antenna is lousy. Stations that come in fine with the factory antenna fade in and out on this one. Didn't bother returning it. Just threw it away.
B000816KNC|5|awesome price and the fit great
B00SZHJFLU|5|Fit well
B006G3W4J0|1|I ordered the Dorman  56276 Driver Side Heated Plastic Mirror. It came with no instructions whatsoever! I had to look online for the method to try and remove the previous mirror. It took a good 30 minutes to figure out how to get it off. After installing the back plate onto the new replacement mirror I tried to reinstall it. It ended up cracking and breaking into pieces! I consider myself very mechanically inclined, but without any sort of instruction or way to install the product, I ended up wasting 50+ dollars for a product that didn't meet expectations. Now I have no choice, but to order another replacement with the hopes that this doesn't break as well. At this point, I would not recommend the product or company!
B00HNHWW54|2|Fits good, Wiring is so so and to short. switch is junk and fell apart
B0053TVKT8|5|Been looking for something like this a long time.I read reviews where it didn't fit well but it fits perfect like a glove.
B00FW1JQZC|4|Love the color and easy instillation! It literally told you which bulbs go where. However it didn't have the cargo led's and now I have to order those. But I am still happy with this purchase!
B00VGL76CM|5|Fits perfectly on this new type of trailer hitch.
B00BCRMAR6|5|I love the green and black color combination and really the picture doesn't do these any justice. The green is a very bright, vibrant green that really pops against the black. These covers were easy to put on the seats and they fit snugly. I drive a 2007 Dodge Caliber and they fit perfectly and look great. They're light and breathable. I did have to make slits in the back of the bench seat cover to put my son's car seat back in with the hooks on the back of the seat, but it wasn't really a problem for me to do so. Other than that, I've had no problems at all with the seat covers. My two older children love the seatbelt covers too! Definitely a great set.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B000P58DMC|3|no better than the one from ford motor.
B00029WYEY|5|As expected.  K&N a great product.
B005E1KRRQ|5|Great job as usual.  Keep up the good work.
B004A0WFQS|4|Fits great!
B00AO6H81Y|5|This helmet is so comfortable and functional!
B008MISBRQ|5|So far, so good.  Just used it today.  will know more after driving the vehicle for a few days.  Wish it was full synthetic, though.
B004I12438|5|Just as expected. Arrived in a timely manner.  Hubby had it installed in 15 minutes
B00U1PFODM|5|This is a very well made cable with great connectors and a reasonable price. i would purchase this again from this seller.
B00X6DF2UQ|5|Fits my car perfectly and the material is nice!
B00C696VSS|5|Relatively easy to install, works as advertised, but is less sturdy than the one I had in my KIA Optima.
B000NECLQE|5|Bought one for my classic E30 red convertible and I love this key. I find small details like having an OEM key make the experience much more enjoyable. Very highly recommend this item.
B00KTJ0EA8|5|Awesome price - easily programmed!
B0095TC6I6|5|We just purchased a travel trailer and blog members recommended the Grand Aero Towing Mirror. We couldn't be more pleased. Our previous mirror strapped to the vehicle and hitched to the door jams, bounced around and were basically useless.  The Grand Aero Towing Mirror is easy to install, doesn't damage the vehicle and we can see to the sides of our trailer with ease. It is steady and well worth your investment.
B00GWFOKYO|5|Deep blue and brightness  didn't  expect  both for the price  but im very pleased
B00TYNN9R0|4|Fit perfectly
B00DF2WP5S|5|Sticks well
B00429NKWK|5|Works so much better than the others I've used - I had a business clearing headlights. Wish I'd had THIS then!
B0085XV9JA|3|its ok I didn't expect it to be so small
B000I04Z7Q|5|Very nice.. Project turned out nice
B00736L152|5|Product was shipped promptly and was exactly what I expected
B00J73DDWI|5|Works great easy to install
B00RUE3I1W|5|Feels really solid and doesn't move out of adjustment.
B00K9ZXFAI|5|This part worked to shorten the distance between it's attachment point and the bracket where the trans kick-down cable is located. I'm using a 1406 Edelbrock carb, mounted on an Edelbrock 2913 Super Victor intake manifold, on a pre-86 Chevy 350cid block, with a TH200-4R trans, in my 1986 Chevy Monte Carlo. My biggest problem was finding a bracket that would position the cables in the correct locations. At first I tried a Mr. Gasket adjustable bracket. The throttle cable location was fine but even after modifications I couldn't get the kick-down location close enough. I finally took an old bracket off of a 1976 Chey PU with sbc and cut off all the metal not needed. I was left with a bracket that only held the kick-down cable. This moved that location about an inch more forward. Bingo! I probably should have bought the Edelbrock bracket to begin with.
B00DT7C806|5|Its a great piece. Finishes off the MDX and not many people have it so it sets yours apart from the rest. I did the install myself and I don't even change the oil in my car! Was not the easiest DIY but doable and saves a ton from having the dealership do it.
B00IP6BKM8|4|Fitment was a little off.  Had to dremel the clamping part of the passenger side corner light, and it wasn't strong enough to hold itself in, so I made another minor adjustment.  And the holes for the headlights and high beam bulbs were off, in that they left the bulbs facing the wrong direction so when you put the housings back in their place, the bulbs hit the supports in the back.  (the slots on the holes for the bulbs were oriented wrong).
B00YE3SFRE|1|This was a VERY disappointing way to spend 50 bucks.  The &#34;memory&#34; is non-existent. The pad goes down to nothing when sitting ;on it. It's like sitting on the chair itself. Would NOT recommend this at ALL.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Looked great, but it's a stinker and blew off in less than two month.
B000BHNU2C|5|work much better that the two sided cutter
B01092I9LA|1|The seat covers don't fit my Ford Mustang that good!!!
B00KYDA5C6|4|Crazy bright great product for the price.<br />It make a little humming noise but with your machine on you will not be able to here it.
B001A74LKC|5|great jacket!  the removal inner lining is a awesome feature
B00KTMMQJM|5|Put on the handle bars, adjust the chain pully backward, check the oil and go!  If you move the tensioner pully back, this little bike will carry large adults around.  Not faster than you could peddle a bike so don't worry.  Great fun for everyone.  Have had it a couple months now and have had to tighten the handlebars twice and tighten the throttle cable.  Oil level is fine and a tank will run you around all day.  100lbs or less is zero problems but heavier people cannot go up steep grades.  I am 230lbs and I ride it occasionally and have a lot of fun.  There is no suspension and no transmission so it couldn't be simpler to drive.  Have fun.
B00C4YKBOA|3|Installed Aug 1st, 2015.  I did not do the install, but the tech told me that the hose connections tolerances are very tight.  Seems to be working fine, tho doesn't seem to blow as cold as original.  Expansion valve is located behind the dash, which added time to the install.  Not a job for the timid do-it-your-selfer.  Highly recommended to replace the condenser as well.
B005U30NTU|5|Everything was perfect. Nice fit and cargo basket I had fit right on it
B000WK6BKQ|5|Going on 25 years of EK chain being a solid trust worthy chain
B000FW7V50|5|I use it every other tankful. My 2010 Cadillac DTS  (84K) Still gets 27 MPG on the highway with the original injectors. Update 9/17 109K miles. Original plugs and injectors. Got. 29.3 mpg on on a trip from Janesville, wi to Cleveland, Oh
B000C9MI4K|5|What a difference. I replaced the filter and it quieted down the engine so much that I had to open the window to make sure it was running. Sounds stupid but true. Runs very smooth now.
B0038RXI0G|5|I can see why everyone seems to like these DeKups.  My favorite thing about DeKups is being able to spray paint at any angle including upside down and without worries of a spill.  Too bad the throw-away replacement cups are so expensive, but I guess if your able to save on cleanup supplies and make painting easier, then I suppose the cost is justified.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend DeKups to others.  Just make sure you get the correct adaptor for your spray gun.
B0085KGOIE|3|Only use it for 1 weekend. Seems ok. I gave it a 3 star because I only got one hose attachment and need to Walmart to buy other one
B0023VB9S6|5|Fits good
B00JJ68C2O|2|It came days late I wrote the company telling them and never recived a response. It fits ok does look very nice tho in my k10
B003AW1LEE|5|Good
B00KO1QE2S|5|Highly recommend anything from TST. They are extremely thorough with their  install instructions, and service. Thanks!
B00AA5IUVQ|4|Cool idea, the two I tried worked fine, the cardboard/foam container is cheapo, in my opinion they could have made up a nice little plastic box with molded compartments for each relay tester.The  container would not last long in my tool box,so I got a more durable plastic container to store the kit in.
B003Q2LDHS|5|Fit perfect was was delivered earlier than expected
B00BMRRXSM|5|Wow! This beverage holder is the best, and we've been shopping!<br />It holds every type of drinking container, stem ware, mugs, cans, everything, large and small. It even accommodates a bowl! Another neat feature is the foot pad at the bottom that you step on to sink it securely in the ground. None of the others offer this. Our ground is hard and rocky. Trying to sink anything by pushing with our hands is impossible.<br />We purchased two :)
B00C7M3I9O|5|Arrived quickly! Perfect drop for my 2011 w204 sport 4matic!
B0031BCPMQ|5|Worth the money, looks good on the sportster
B008ZCEFJW|5|Installed and perfect fit and quality
B002UC1AYQ|5|replaced cracked AM 5 high handle flush perfectly
B00L4KUNE8|1|Cheap jolts that broke off when installing causing 4 hours of work to remove
B00J65I41C|5|I use this on my Goldwing Trike after every wash and love how it keeps it shiny and easier to clean.  It's the only 'wax' I've used since I bought the Trike over 5 years ago.
B004I8M03K|5|The price was at least half of what the Stealers (Dealers) were asking, the shipping was fast, they look great and the installation went well. Now we'll have to wait and see how well they work out over time.
B00LEBLI82|5|These lights are very bright--they are great!
B005JYWUWI|5|Fit perfectly and a kid could install it, no problem. Looks just like the factory part.
B00AW1AF34|5|Easy to fit once I bought the special tool
B0042UAHGQ|3|Only used it once...time will tell...but so far so go
B006JD481Y|4|Just because it doesn't have the factory info printed on the back of the fob - doesn't mean it doesn't work!!  Geez….  It works just fine and dandy<br />AND CHEAPER than from Chevrolet too!
B010MDPO00|5|Suzuki inazuma GW250-- Both mirrors with &#34;Mirror Riser - RH Riser - RH Bolt - 10mm&#34; Perfect match
B000N8DMZ4|2|Amazon said this was the correct distributor cap for my engine, but it wasn't. I didn't realize until I had everything apart and wired which was pretty frustrating. Definitely double and triple check when ordering this product to ensure Amazon gets it right when you supply your vehicle year, make, and model.
B006JXSTC8|5|Nice for loads of hay. Use one strap instead of lots
B00KX35HTS|5|I installed on my four wheeler. Talk about lighting up the woods. perfect for what I needed.
B00407RTBW|5|Worked well.  Used the white primer for a white car bumper. Even solid spray. No runs, drips or errors. Followed with matching paint, which was really good, and clear coat. Very pleased. For around $ 27 did an amazing job.
B000CLN18U|5|Fit well in my Camry, hope the flanges last longer than previous pipe.
B00308BTO0|5|This is just the most adorable froggie I've seen in a long time!
B000QQ7T20|2|I have mixed feelings because replacing my flywheel made me realize that the one I had was poorly balanced.  My big disappointment was finding out that the LuK200 Flywheel that I ordered came with the six bolt holes mis-machined to be about 1/16 inch toward the alignment pins (see photo attached). I had to use a rotary file grinder to elongate all the clutch plate holes to align with the bolt holes in the flywheel. Other than that everything went OK, and my truck seems smoother because of the better balanced flywheel.
B00WAA6ED0|5|Perfect fit. Just what I needed.
B0042TTB3M|5|This buffing pad is great, the material is excellent and the self centering feature is a very nice idea, I achieved great results with this pad and it seems very very durable compared with other brands I own.
B007RHX2FY|3|It's not genuine or &#34;oem&#34;. It is a little lighter then the oem one and feels cheeper. Does do the job for my 335i with no cel. Was only replacing due to the chord breaking on the stock one. See pic. oem is in my hand.one I bought is installed.
B00407TU8W|5|Paint matched perfectly with my car. Good product.
B0009IQXFO|1|Soap is soap regardless of manufacturer ,who can really tell he difference
B00JKGUFVY|3|if you have a 60-40
B00HVIKJ64|1|Idiots fail to mention it won't fit a '14 Cummins
B00LMJ50FI|1|I purchased this kit with intentions of using it for my RV. I gave this product a one star review because its lack of the correct description. I was very disappointed in this product when I found out that I could not use both levelers at the same time. If you do not have the wide span axles this product will not work on your RV
B00EYTNO8S|5|perfect!, saves battery in trailer big time. good light, similar to OEM color
B00EA0ZB7I|4|These lights were used on my commercial vehicle and they are a great asset to be backing up at night
B0083RNWI4|5|A great jacket for a good price. I've been wearing mesh jackets for years and this one is the best so far.  Tour Master gear is always well made and dependable. this one is especially great as it has a true waterproof liner supplemented with a quilted liner for warmth. I have one of their tank bags that is 20 years old and still going strong.
B002NGVHMO|1|The add says reduce slippage my golf cart starter belt slipped bad so I bought your product. when II sprayed the belt it slips worse than ever it won't even start now. you can take it back  and CHANGE YOUR ADD, that reads prevents slippage you guy are stupid.
B00R6M00DM|5|Simple install, easy on the knees  fits good and looks good
B000C9TZBY|4|Worked on my 98 Chevy K1500..Original wires were scorched and not making a good connection on the heater control which I also replaced..
B00HZB8X42|5|These are bright labels as described with a good adhesive. I am using them outdoors mounted on a piece of vinyl plastic that I covered with clear tape to post on our fence out front. They are smaller than the normal metal warning signs which are too large for our needs.
B000BPZ55Y|4|works like air duct hose should. A very clean install.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Works as expected.  Has saved us on a few occasions having to park on gravel surfaces.
B0050Z9X0I|5|I was a little skeptical about installing this but it went very quickly. There are two metal ballasts that need to be mounted as well as a splitter module. Not a lot in the way of directions but it's really plug and play and no need to cut any wires. I do suggest mounting the ballast so they do not move. They do make a &#34;clunk&#34; sound when turned on and when they go from low to high beam. They also hum a bit as they warm up. Super bright, and I do mean super bright. I highly doubt I will ever use the high beams. I also bought the HID fog lights and they seem to be plug and play. Same set up as the above in that the ballast need be mounted somewhere. That seems to be the only downside as I have very little space to mount within my engine compartment. I am impressed by the quality, given the price. These are top notch! We’ll see if they last 2+ years. I think that seems to be the only issue with other reviewers other than a few ballast that don’t work out of the package. I haven’t had to deal with support or replace anything as of yet.
B00S77QUMK|3|Cloth so won't last to many years, but fit nice
B002BHWZFI|5|Works great
B00FOD2E8Y|1|Not what I expected it to be. I will return it and request my money back
B000VTO2BI|5|Great shifter knob,have not missed a shift yet.100% better than my stock shifter on my c5 Vette.
B00FBKSDDA|3|6000k says bright white but is definitely  blue. Not white with a tint of blue.  Extremely blue. Wiring instructions weren't included or clear on posting.  Took 5 tries to get it to work and I'm pretty technically savvy.
B008S3POHU|4|Fits perfect for my 2004 A4. I have had it for 6 months and it's been very durable. The only think that made me give it 4 stars is that the padding is very minimal and I like to rest my arm there. After awhile you can feel the plastic underneath. But the for the price I can't really complain and it just works.
B00407V5B2|3|Was a close color match but not quite ok until I find a better match
B0009TCR9O|5|good price, but packing was terrilbe
B00J2CI6B2|5|Bulbs look great
B009M1VO6C|4|Works good. More purple than blue but I like it. Bright an easy to install.
B000NJ39E2|4|Good quality at a great price
B006WNR7H8|4|Overall I am pleased.  However, the back floor mats are not the same size.  One of the mats doesn't size up for the 2012 Camry.  I've decided to just make do with it rather than returning it.
B002ZTOBTU|5|Great product, keeps my rugs free of mud and sand from work.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Bag held up for a 30 hour round trip.  Sun rain and high winds had no effect on it.  It does take a little while to strap to the roof but other than that I have no complaints.  Sturdy construction with heavy duty zipper and straps.  Would buy again.
B00E822OH8|5|This helmet is pretty awesome. I wear a medium normally, so I bought a medium and it fits well. At first it was a little snug but after the cheek pads get squished down some it's more comfortable. It's easier to flip the modular portion up,put it on, then flip it back down after the helmets on your head. The headphones work great, but I'm used to in-ear headphones, so there is considerably less bass. The plus side is that you can hear the speakers at all speeds. I have an iphone and this helmet works great with it. You can ask siri to read you your text messages and reply while riding. Also, the microphone is great. I did the ancient, forgotten art of the phone call, and the caller couldn't tell I was on a motorcycle. The only thing that somewhat upsets me about the helmet is the lack of nose-piece. It looked like there was one from the picture but if you zoom in you can see there's not. It is especially irritating due to the fact that the sun visor has a nose cut out. But, I haven't got a sun burn on my nose yet lol. Also, the helmet can feel heavy while looking down, but it weighs about the exact same as a dirt bike helmet I have. I would recommend this helmet if you're tired of pulling over to read text messages, or look at a map, or need to take phone calls for work etc. Also I am happy with the craftsmanship and fit/finish of the helmet. Also, the seller shipped the helmet quickly and I was able to get it a day prior to the forecasted window of delivery.
B00AQ38I8C|5|Our car was broken into and for some unknown reason the burglar broke the driver's sun visor. Ordered this replacement and installed it. Color matches interior and was quick and easy to install. It's been working fine for over a year now.
B00IUE5OPO|4|Great bug spray. You just spray it on and leave it for a bit, per the instructions. The cleaner took most of the bugs off on the first application. This stuff seemed to work much better than others that take 4-5 tries
B0035AMPFK|5|just what i needed fast delivery
B0002KKIXC|5|This stuff is amazing!!!!
B00N0IHMXM|5|If you have an RV with corner scissor jacks, you've got to get this.  Attach to your cordless drill and in 30 sec you'll have all 4 up or down.
B006O85UMU|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 Ninja 636! Was very easy to install and fast shipping.
B00S1PXFVC|4|fits well
B0019BXM1I|5|Perfect fit, bolted up no issues but a lot of compliments.
B001TAPLYA|5|My order was promptly delivered and they were installed. The product was just what I wanted.
B00M0FSRTE|5|Sweet
B0067MGCEI|5|Fast shipping, great product.
