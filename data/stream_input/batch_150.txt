0425170349|5.0|I just have to say this: If you like realistic action, and not a lot of pages that go off into irrelevant detail, GET THIS BOOK. It is my all time favorite book, a must-read, and an awesome plot. Get it and have fun!
630451087X|5.0|i think, if one relies on plot too much in this film, it's incomprehensive and bizzare.  you see, lost highway is an exercise in style.  most of the elements in the film (the idenity switching, the videotapes) are merely interesting ideas on lynch's part.  if you can just get the jist of what's going on and follow it, this film is another masterpiece by lynch, right up there with blue velvet and eraserhead.  for the love of god, see this film.
0553106635|4.0|I sure hope so.  This 3rd book has increased the pace of the story line and moved the plot in ways I wouldn't have guessed.  And that is a great thing.  There is a large mass of scifi/fantasy out there and it is hard to find fresh ideas.  Martin has done a great job and this was a wonderful read.<br />A word of caution: he can be pretty graphic is some of the love scenes.  I didn't mind, but this isn't C.S. Lewis here.  But even if those scenes would make you uneasy, the rest of the story would make up for it.  Just skip those parts! ;-)<br />A great read.  I'll buy number 4 as soon as it comes out.  That's the best praise I can give.  Money talks volumes.
0446677450|5.0|This book is a must read for the average middle class american who has a interest in improving their finacial future.  The author is an educator and it shows through in his effective presentation of the not so obvious way wealth is obtained.  <br />The principals in the book are simple and sound, and the average person stuck in the rat race needs to read this effective explanation about wealth building.
B0000025CP|5.0|I love this CD!  One of metal's finest
B00004ZAV3|5.0|After reading about two hundred or so reviews for this album (hey I had alot of free time) I decided it was time to write my own. Even though everything that needs to be said has been said let me point out these facts for you:<br /><br />1) Please Please Me didn't hit #1 on the British chart that is used today as the reference point. This chart (Record Retailer) is used because it was the only one to be based on sales only.<br /><br />2) In America Billboard charted each side of a single as seperate entities until 1969. This is why Penny Lane is here and Strawberry Fields Forever isn't. However I blame the British: it was kept out of #1 by Englebert Humperdink.<br /><br />3)The First double A-side to hit #1 after Billboard changed this policy was Something/Come Together.<br /><br />4)It's a happy karmic accident that the Beatles had enough #1 Hits, based on the charts used, to nearly fill out an 80 minute cd<br /><br />5)This is the first time that Apple (i.e. the Beatles themselves) have felt so generous as to fill an entire disc up. I could spend hours on this  subject.<br /><br />6)Whether or not your's or my favorite song isn't here doesn't matter.  It's a theme album<br /><br />7)If this disc makes beatlefans out of any teen that listens to it then it has served it's purpose.<br /><br />8)This album is a great listen especially in your car(hence my title).<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0000584V3|5.0|I first heard of Opeth on a heavy metal website named metal-rules.com.  From reading the review of their previous masterpiece cd &quot;Still Life&quot;, I had to find their upcoming release Blackwater Park.  I bought this cd and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  This cd had some of the fullest, richest, and incredible sounds ever put on a cd.  Most of the songs had incredible and beautiful textures, mindblowing instrument playing, and mindnumbing vocals.  If you are a metalhead, buy this cd and be prepared to be blown away by the incredible talent of these musicians.  If you like this album, seek out their other albums; Orchid, Morningrise, My Arms Your Hearse, and Still Life.  These are also incredible albums too.
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult writes a compelling and beautifully paced novel of love and angst, a tale that mixes the lives of  4 adults and 3 children with a satisfying lifestyle, who can't believe or find peace with the traumatic events created by suicide within their circle.<br />The characters are well drawn and sympathetic, and Picoult's writing style, which moves from current day events back to the past and weaves the story to its roots, wins the reader over immediately.  It's a particularly well drawn account of what happens to a young person imprisoned for a long period of time while the justice system slowly moves through its motions - Chris is the character that centers the book, and grows and changes through the aftermath of suicide, although Emily, with all her flaws, is the heart of the story.<br />I generally read thrillers &amp; mysteries and took a break from them with this book.  I was rewarded with a rich reading experience and a book I will cherish for a long time and recommend to friends.<br />Moms &amp; Dads - please read the book.  There are so many clues to what can happen to your teens without you being aware....if something similar has happened to your family, &quot;The Pact&quot; will give you comfort.  If it has not, it will make you more self-aware of the dynamics of your family, and how you may need to examine and change them as your children grow.
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle is the best thing since slice bread. My entire family is an avid fan (from my 3 year old niece, who can sign all the songs, to my daughter who has Cerebral Palsy). We are never bored because her voice is one of the finest instrument I have ever heard. I feel a kindship with this beautiful soul just by her music. Some of the notes she reaches bring tears of joy. I am truly blessed to have this wonderful Light &amp; Sound of a sister in my life. I was turned on to her last year by my Sister-In-Law and we have been turning others on to her.  Everyone loves her - Catch a Concert and you will be amazed and uplifted.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is one of the most watched films of my childhood, ever sence i founf it amongst my parents videos.  I used to watch this film religiously with my sister every sunday without fail.  Sice i bought i bought my dvd player i have been waiting to get this, so when the 25th anniversary edition was released i bought it.  There are loads of extras on this dvd amongst the two dics with features like, a deleted scene entitled &quot;once In A While&quot;, 11 minutes of outakes and altenative ending credits, Documentories and trailers.  This is a must have dvd for any fan of the film, i have been a fan since i was 5 and i always will be and i will always remember the time i went to see the stage production in Birmingham which featured the real Magenta it was fantastic
B0000025CP|5.0|This is one of those albums that anyone who considers themselves a metalhead has to have.  It defines what metal is all about.  Every song is perfect!  Rob Halford's singing is beyond incredible (as always).  The lyrics are very well wrought too.  The production on the album is great too.  Stained Class is the greatest album from heavy metal's greatest band, Judas Priest.  I love all of the tracks but the best are Exciter, Beyond The Realms Of Death, Invader, and the title track.  This CD will be in your player for a very long time.  It is very addictive.  Go out and buy it. Stained Class RULES!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie was incredible, there wasn't a thing about it that I didn't like. What I enjoyed most was the use of music to emphasize what was happening in the film. In almost every scene there was a different piece of music in the background, or foreground to set the mood. Music is a large part of our lives, and its ability to take us back to specific times and places is amazing, and this movie will do that for the viewer.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana has always been one of my favorite bands (also a DIEHARD FOO FIGHTERS FAN). And their disc Nevermind is like the best CD I have. It starts out with one of the greatest hardrock songs, Smells Like Team Spirit and has awsome hits like Lithium, Come As You Are, and Polly. If your anything like me and love hard, punk rock you must have this CD.Being a guitarist myself the electric and bass guitar plays a huge part, and every song  has a great beat. Well its not much but I hope my review will help you. See ya later dudes...Burnout!
B00004YKUY|4.0|Ok, ok, Journey fans! I sold out and bought this! Journey has been my favorite band since 1978 and I have stuck with them through all the bs. Captured is the greatest live album ever! I love everything Journey has put out. ( yes, even Raised on Radio &amp; Trial by Fire!) So, when I heard Clone-Perry on VH1's Behind the Music I was livid! I knew Schon &amp; Cain wanted to do this for a long time, but I never thought they would. BUT, the unexplainable force that is the power of Journey gripped me and I bought this cd. I love it! I suggest you listen to the real audio before you buy and make a choice for yourself.  Let me tell you why you won't be disappointed. 1.) There is sooo much garbage in music right now, plastic boy bands, singing Barbie dolls, &amp; cut n' paste rap/metal bands, ( tell me I'm wrong!) and to hear this kind of music is a HUGE relief! 2.) The heart and soul of Journey runs all thru this cd. Everything you loved about Journey is here again. So, go ahead and sell out! You won't regret it!
B00004TL21|5.0|Its a double edged sword in many ways - if a band comes up with a new sound, they are bound to lose many of their fans. stay exactly the same, and they would not be progressive enough.  the trend with many rock bands these days is that they generally go for a lighter (dare i say 'poppier') sound to show that they are indeed more than a dumb, one dimensional unit that can only pound out the same thing.  as a result some of the fans go ape droppings - they've gone soft, commercial, for ten year olds.   <br />To the people who say this about the deftones;  you are shallow, oh so shallow, and pathetic.  Anyone with more than a few brain cells would realise that the Deftones latest release is if anything, a step up from their previous work.  They are a fine band that produce fine music.  Chino moreno has the ideal voice, whether screaming in the assertive &quot;elite&quot; or floating in the beautiful subscape of &quot;teenager&quot;.  While White Pony is not as openly brutal and dead heavy as its predecessors Adrenaline and Around the fur, both of which were convincing, it is a better production because the Deftones, like many other bands you all hate now, have matured, and they have created almost a masterpiece with White Pony.  The songs are varied but as with many good lps, are of deep musical quality and juxtaposition.  Feiticeira is a great opener, a fresh sounding Chino winding up his voice, Digital Bath is superb, simply crafted and brilliantly executed, as is the voice of the metal master Moreno.  Elite is a pounding, heavy number that was meant for the mosphit, RX queen is slower, twisted, but more beautiful.   Street Carp is inventive, but teenager is unlike anything the Deftones have done before - almost lullably like, and a hallmark of the depth of the new Deftones.  Knife Party is excellent, grinding rock, and Korea (my personal favorite) is the perfect heavy point of the lp.   Passenger, a Toolesque sounding song is tuneful and convincing, and Change is anexcellent new single, slower than expected for the Deftones, and more harmonic at times.  Pink Maggit is a reprisal of Back to School, only slower and more drawn out.  All in all one of last year's best. Congratulations to Chino, Abe, Frank, Steve Carpenter and Chi.     <br />The Deftones, in my opinion, are now one of the best hard rock units around.  You can knock Limp Bizkit, Metallica and the Offspring as much as you like, but if you knock the new Deftones you are just a sad sorry case. If you dont believe in bands changing just a little with each new release they bring out, then i believe you are missing out, and you can go back to beating your head with a stick.
B000002NFM|4.0|Yes, this came out almost four years ago, but it's still a frightening album.  From start to finish, the beats don't stop, and the band continues to prove how it can take techno music to new heights.  The vocals generally don't add much, but the beat--oh my God, the beat.  In my mind, tracks 5, 6 and 7 are some of the scariest music ever recorded.  If you get into techno, you probably already own this--if you don't, this is an excellent place to start.
B00004TH6O|4.0|I bought this CD not knowing much about the band. I was not disappointed, though I didn't know it was such straight-forward &quot;stoner rock&quot;. It's a great rock album- but not for most of you sober people out there. However, it will provide great background music for all you pot-heads when you're sittin around the hooka sparkin' a bowl with your spaced out buddies. QOTSA is a great band that shouldn't be overlooked. Check 'em out.
6305399212|5.0|This movie is by far better than alien, the original first film.  The first film is good, but cannot match the tension that permeates the sequel. Aliens just plain rocks!!!! By the way steer clear of Alien3.
B00000099Y|5.0|I first heard tool on the radio and i have to admit i was a bit skeptical because they sounded a little bit Nine Inch Nails  and i wanted something new and original not another clone.So i went out and bought it anyway . It turned out to be one of the greatest cds ive ever heard second to only dark side of the moon by Pink Floyd. This cd is full of genuine talent from Maynards vocals to the continuous heart pounding drums. Unlike most cds i own i listen to this one over and over because every song is great . The only problem with this cd is that there are to many interludes and skits. But other than that this cd is perfect!
0783225970|5.0|I had been told by many that Scarface was an excellant movie so I picked it up the other day and watched it.  This movie is an excellant movie.  Al Pacino's acting in this film is incredible and nobody can deny that.  If you like films with a lot of good &quot;one liners&quot; that you can walk around and quote with a bunch of your friends than this is what you are looking for as long as you don't mind the language and the violence.  It is not a happy film, it is very depressing, which is why many of the people here give it a bad rating.  If you pay attention to the movie it will make good sense.  It is a 1983 movie and it certainly beats alot of todays movies.  Watch this movie and then try a recent movie released in 2000, I think you will feel that you are being deprived of the entertainment you deserve.
B00004X01U|5.0|When we think of Madonna, we think of new music, and this is exactly the concept behind this album. Madonna collaborates with amateur French DJ Mirwais Amhadzai, and British Producer William Orbit, to create &quot;Parisian Pop meets Midwestern Folk and R&amp;B&quot;. Although the album is very short, the gems this album possesses, won't make you think twice about how short it is. My favorite songs on this album are: &quot;Music&quot; already one of Madonna's biggest club hits on both sides of the atlantic that went to the #1 for 4 weeks and is still getting radio airplay, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; I love the vocal distortions and the new sounds Mirwais has incorporated to make it sound very Parisian. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; Another Madonna hit, with cool Midwest Folk meets American R&amp;B, this song is easily one of the major highlights of the album not to mention the funky guitar skipping at the beginning of the song, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; the new Madonna single that sounds like one of Madonna's earliest songs, demanding recognition for the females, destined to be another hit. Sit back Britney and Christina, and let Madonna show you who the Mother Of Pop is. &quot;Gone&quot; Folk no doubt! This song seems to be inspired by Jewel or Sheryl Crow, of course synthesizer plays a major part in this song also. If you listen close to this song, Madonna seems to want out of the spot light, nooo! Say it isn't so!!<br />While this can be classified easily as one of Madonna's greatest albums, it is actually up to you to decide. You owe it to yourself to pick this cd up, you won't be disappointed!!!
B000002AGN|5.0|The reason I write a review for a record like this - which has had so many sensitive and eloquent remaks made about it - is because no real love for great art should go unexpressed. The magic of this record is not really in the tricky time signatures; it is in the fact that Brubeck overlays 4/4 melodies over 5/4 rythems; and 4/4 melodies over 3/4 rythem, and 3/4 melodies over 4/4 and 5/4 rythems. He is very clever and inspired when it comes to altering the rythmeic character beneath an understandable 4/4 or 3/4 melody and then bringing back the rythemic regularity to end the melodic phrase.This is why this record is so enjoyable. It is a playful record. It ought not be compared to records that Davis and his imitators were making at about the same time. Such comparisons are like comparing Dr. Strangelove to Dr. Zhivago. To comapre them is to insult them both, and we should love all of these artists.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is by far the very best of the very best.  Consider the Filmore Concerts to be a road map of how it's supposed to be.  The very best of the Allman Brothers Band.  Most likely the best live performance by the best live band ever.
B000002KOJ|5.0|Some artists have the ability to establish a deep and lasting relationship with their listeners. Joni Michell never persuaded us to understand any pretensisive innocence; Joni won the hearts of her following with a patient, persistant, and often inspired songwriting, an angelic voice, and an honest and artistic  reckoning with her formidable womanhood. Joni's work - embodied perfectly in this record - will hook you if you are in any way susceptible to her charm. This record really ought sold with a warning: The rapture it imparts to loving and vulnerable listeners does not fade with time. If you love this record, you will love it until the day you die.
B0000508U6|4.0|Colplay is a band who doesn't have any characteristics of a mainstream rock and roll band, like Radiohead, but have somehow found a spot in American music. Their first single off the album, Yellow and most likely the last, is very good, showcasing the band's catchy lyrics and melodies, but with enough heavy guitar riffs to keep things interesting. Other good songs from Parachutes include the ambitious Don't Panic,the subtle Spies, and my favorite Everything's Not Lost with a great melodic ending. Lead singer Martin shows much emotion in his lyrics with an electrifying voice that fits perfectly into pace with the music. This cd should definetely be checked out by the following fans of:Travis,Radiohead,Idlewild,Badly Drawn Boy,Verve,Ben Folds Five, and Blur.

B000002C25|2.0|When Oasis is good, they have catchy lyrics and well thought out arrangements.But when they're bad,they sound annoyingly loud and rushed.This cd shares a bit of each.With good tracks like D'You Know What I Mean,All Around the World, and Don't Go Away, you wonder how they made the crappy My Big Mouth,I Hope I Think I Know,etc.If you liked Whats the Story (Morning Glory)chances are you will not like this album.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is a truely all time great album for me, the songs Muscle Museum and Unintended are very powerful songs and Unintended is quite moving. The song contrasts from the firery Sunburn to the calm Unintended and it all gells together niceley. Its a shame more people aren't aware of this great talent, just becuase they are not overly publisised like Hear'say or Westlife there talent goes to waste. A lot of bands nowadays, like Hear'say, aren't in the industry for the right reasons, all they care about is their special number one and the amount of cash they will get out of it. The week leading up to their number one they appeared on 3 shows a day, Muse didn't publicise Muscle Museum at all and it failed. The new song Plug in baby is getting around though and it is sonetimes getting radio play, but nowhere near enough, i can rank Muse up there above radiohead and just as good as the sterophonics, i strongly recomend this album.
B000003TAR|5.0|Really, what is needed to be said about this cd. It's just great. The lyrics are deep,meaningful, and actually about things that matter. The guitar riffs are incredible of course, led by Cobain. A cd no one shouldn't have in their collection. One of those few ones that can be played from start to finish.
6300181553|5.0|This gem of a film is one of my all time favorites.  Bing Crosby's singing, Fred Astaire's dancing, and a plot revolving around a romantic triangle and an inn opened only on holidays makes this film good fun to watch.  The characters are likable, the songs and dances are great (particularly Fred Astaire's July 4th number).  Bing Crosby's rendition of &quot;White Christmas&quot; to Marjorie Reynolds is delightful.  If you are looking for good escapist fun, this film is the one to watch.
0451526384|5.0|Although the social formulas are not compatible with the present times, I was moved by the power of the emotions and the psychology of all the characters. The ending left me with a smile that lasted hours. Not because was unpredictable, but because of the beauty of the conclusion.
6301797906|5.0|This film, set in Depression-era Oklahoma and California could have been depressing.  Outstanding performances by Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Jane Darwell as Ma Joad (who won a well-deserved Oscar); and especially John Carradine as Jim Casey, a former preacher who finds his calling again in California keep it from being a downer.<br />The Joad family leaves Oklahoma for California when they lose their farm.  Their friend Casey comes along.  Supposedly, plenty of work is to be had in California, but the Joads find out otherwise.  Work is scarce, and when they do find it, the locals cheat them on their pay.  The family starts to fall apart when California turns out not to be the paradise that they had thought it to be.  Ma's struggle to keep the family together is insiring.  Casey finds redemption by organizing the migrants, or &quot;Okies&quot; as they are called.<br />This is a film that I can watch over and over.
0395925037|5.0|These are the words of wisdom of the one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century. Love him or hate him, there's simply no denying his depth and genius. Think about it this way: One man, poorly educated, penniless, singlehandledley lifting not just Germany but the WORLD out of the Great Depression, turning a war-torn, economically and militarially crippled wasteland into a world superpower. So get over your textbook-influenced prejudice, and gather your OWN OPINION. Read the book and think for yourself.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is a phenominal debut. Muse are fairly popular in the UK (their biggest hit so far is 11 and the album got to 14). This album explains why. It manages to combine the innovation of lo-fi indie rock brit-pop bands like Coldplay or Radiohead with the energy of grunge like Nirvana. And the result is stunning.<br />The whole album has an angsty feel, and there is serious passion in Matt's vocals, not least in the amazing opener, Sunburn. The lyrics are passionate and if pain could be turned into a song it would sound somewhere near Sunburn, with its heavy guitars, breaking vocals and hyptonising piano.<br />This is followed up by Muscle Museum, one of the best songs of recent times. The Latin-like guitar riff delicately opens it and the tune is really catchy, with a good bass line. It then breaks into another angsty chorus ('Can you see that I am needing/Begging for so much more that you could ever give/I don't want you to adore me/Don't want you to ignore me/Where it pleases you/I'll do it on my own'). This is the best songs on the album, its also fairly heavy.<br />Filip is the next. Its a weird track but I've grown to love it. It's chorus is beautifully dischordant and it seems to be speeding up incessantly until Matt whines 'to you' in the chorus.<br />Next is the first light track on the album, Falling Down, but its not a boring acoustic song, its got a ghostly feel to it. The falsetto is used superbly on this track.<br />Cave is another angsty rocker. It sounds really ghostly, and nearly descends into goth despite its falsetto as Matt screams 'Come into my cave and I'll burn your heart away' in the chorus. Its another memorable song.<br />Showbiz is also ghostly, as it begins with African drums and deep vocals, manifesting itself in a heavy chorus as Matt screams 'They make me dream your dreams/Make me scream your screams' but then the original vocal tune is played in a high octave shimmeringly on the guitar like one of those really slow metal songs.<br />Unintended is the second light tune, but is even more ghostly than Falling Down. The lyrics are superb and the falsetto is totally chilling. This is the first Muse track I heard and I thought they were all like this, but the album is much much harder.<br />Uno is next and was the band's debut single. It has superb lyrics ('This means nothing to me/ cos you are nothing to me/And it means nothing to me that you blew this away/Cos you could have been number one if you only found the time/And you could have ruled the whole world if you'd had the chance') and a painful chorus. Its the third Muse track I heard and, after Muscle Museum and Unintended, convinced me to buy the album.<br />Sober is similar to Filip, but with slightly less effect. However its still an excellent track. Escape starts off like Falling Down or Unintended and by the end is a bit harder. Its tune is very haunting.  Overdue has a slightly electronic feel to it, but is still primarily rock and in basic tune is similar to Cave, for example.<br />The final track, Hate This And I'll Love You, is really heartbreaking, and a great album closer. It sounds similar to Showbiz.<br />I would NOT reccomend this CD if you only like happy music, but if you like good music, I would reccomend it. The best tracks are Muscle Museum, Uno, Sunburn, Cave and Unintended, but there are other excellent tracks too.
B00004XQ83|5.0|When an album of old-time music goes platinum and hits #1 on the country chart with no significant radio airplay, one may rightly wonder what the hell is going on.  The star power of George Clooney in this depression-era Coen Brothers film may have drawn attention, but the soundtrack stands on its own as a remarkable achievement.  The 19 rustic tracks here are mountain music, primitive gospel, and the hobo vein of folk, the ancestors of bluegrass and country.  You can feel the desperation, simplicity, and reverence of another era through performances by Ralph Stanley, Gillian Welch, Norman Blake, Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, John Hartford, Chris Thomas King, the Fairfield Four, the Whites, the Cox Family, and others, along with a field recording of a chain gang (&quot;Po Lazarus&quot; by James Carter &amp; the Prisoners), Harry McClintock`s 1928 hobo fantasy &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain,&quot; and the Stanley Brothers classic &quot;Angel Band.&quot;  Union Station takes on the musical identity of the three star characters onscreen, known as the Soggy Bottom Boys, and their stark, unvarnished renditions of &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; are arresting.  Ditto for Ralph Stanley, who raises the hairs on the back of the neck with his acapella mountain singing on &quot;O Death,&quot; and the Fairfield Four on &quot;Lonesome Valley.&quot;  The emotional purity and grit of this soundtrack will take the buildup of the plaque of modern living and peel it right off.
B000002HH2|4.0|I love this album so much. the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because while I totally absolutely love some of the songs on it there are some which leave me a bit dissapointed. For example &quot;You've been Flirting Again&quot; and &quot;Headphones&quot; etc but I LOVE &quot;Army of Me&quot;, &quot;Hyper-ballad&quot;, &quot;Enjoy&quot;, &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;, &quot;I Miss You&quot; , &quot;Isobel&quot; and others. I definately recommend it if you're tired of the mainstream stuff they play on the radio and are looking for something different. Bjork's voice is just amazing. I don't know too many people who can sound that good when they wail =)

B00004ZAV3|5.0|Ever since the day this CD was released I had wanted to purchase it!  It arrived this morning, and was the wait worthwhile!  It's a trip down memory lane.......I can remember where and what I was doing at every point in my life as I sing along with each song.  If you don't have this one, DON'T WAIT, it's a MUST for every Beatles fan........and if you're not one already you will be after listening to this!
B000002OZY|5.0|I have officially been intimidated by a rock album. The Who's Tommy is something I have never experienced until now. With so much candy stuff out there I actually started reading the inside information and found that it was a story of awakening. The liberation of a young man's tortured youth. There are many ways to interpret the ending of this but please don't think of it as pompous. Tommy is merely stating a point through threatening situations. The Who's music is too friendly to actually think that they can create a messianic boy who knows the secrets of the world. He is merely an open mind child who leads you to the places in which you create your own answer! He is your guardian angel, in a way. I thought I knew enough of Rock and Roll to call myself a qualified individual, but when thrown off my feet by this album, I cried that I...was being just as pompous as the people were when they called THIS album pompous. It is important to look at yourself with no confidence, and it is important to look again with confidence. Tommy will help you. I promise.

B00003IPFK|5.0|In simple terms, 'Lonesome Dove' at once pays homage to, and transcends its genre. Many western 'cliches' are touched upon, but never treated conventionally. Most important among them, the notion of the character who will &quot;never die&quot;, because he is the hero, or because he or she is &quot;too sympathetic&quot;. In Larry McMurtry's 'Lonesome Dove', violence, death, and the cruellest motions of 'fate' can come to any character. For this reason alone, 'Lonesome Dove' resembles few others in the genre: it conveys a believable sense of life at the time and in the place of its setting.<br />The people who inhabit this tale are as real and unforgettable as any in great film or literature. Partly the result of high-caliber acting performances, these characters also benefit from the epic length of the film, which allows them to grow convincingly. This is above all a tale of human connections. Central to it is the long, deep friendship of Gus and the Captain. These two contrasting men have built around them what is essentially an extended family, but one made up of friends and associates whose connections are as strong as blood. One of the most distinctive and moving features of the film is its emphasis on men and their emotions. The Captain with his reigned-in feelings, Gus with his widely encompassing love, and the unequivocal, overwhelming love between these two friends are the solid ground upon which the story is told.<br />Seldom mentioned is the photographic beauty of the film. This is no studio-bound effort that could be taking place anywhere. An effort has been made by cinematographer Douglas Milsome to establish a potent feel for place. Scene after scene has the epic feel of people set against the gigantic, brutal, astonishing beauty of the natural environment.<br />The score by Poledouris is among the finest ever. (This most underrated of all western genre elements is partly responsible for the success of such classics as 'Red River', 'The Searchers' and numerous others.) While a conventional, melody-based work, the 'Lonesome Dove' score stands out for the inspiration of its themes and for the deft use that is made of the music. One example: the great scene of Gus leaving Clare's ranch for what will be the last time is underscored by the films main (title) theme--a beautiful tune of simple, mostly stepwise motion--that expresses perfectly, without a hint of bathos, the profound sadness at the center of human lives.<br />Accolades for performances could be given all around, but special mention must be made of Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Rick Schroeder, Danny Glover, Barry Corbin, D.B. Sweeney, Anjelica Huston, and Chris Cooper--as the wonderful July Johnson. <br />'Lonesome Dove', directed by Simon Wincer--a masterpiece worthy of inclusion on any list of great films, the western genre notwithstanding.
B000050XEI|5.0|As an Enya and celtic music fan, I truly enjoy this cd. When I listened to &quot;Only Time&quot; the first time, tears came to my eyes, and it still moves me. This is music for the soul and for all your senses. I highly recommend this work.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I bought this cd after i bought the unplugged cd and i was greatly surprised. I really like the hard rockin in such songs as I was hoping and joining you. (especially joining you!) some better songs of the album are, so pure, thank u, that i would be good, ur, and would not come. I hope you purchase this! I have yet to regreted it!!
1559408855|4.0|This film is disturbing on many levels, only one of which is the &quot;gore&quot;/&quot;torture&quot;, which frankly is minimal and mostly implied. It is the intellectualism underlying the all-pervasive perversion and sense of no hope which gives the film its terror, together with the real-life subsequent murder of Pasolini shortly after the film's completion. One buying tip - the British Film Institute has released a completely uncut print on DVD, together with extras, which can be obtained from Amazon.co.uk at http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005954M/qid=987457227/sr=1-2/202-4897521-1657461. Despite Salo being out of print in the US, therefore, don't let that stop you buying this masterwork of genuine, intellectual terror.
B000002NBY|5.0|In the aftermath of the 1960's, in an alternative universe somewhere, maybe pop music started to evolve into something more like this... with the ambition of the long, passionate and occasionally high-concept songs of Led Zeppelin, Iron Butterfly, Cat Stevens and other musicians of that generation, but having gained some wisdom from the passage of time. Maybe in that universe, song about ideas grew from being refreshing but simplistic to being truly thoughtful and thought-provoking (and not just when you're on drugs). Here, however, the idea of &quot;edge&quot; stuck, the bizarre notion that what matters isn't being a good, say, rapper, rocker, etc, but being MORE of a rapper. Too bad-- we could have had more sophisticated, catchy songs like &quot;The Mystery of Fingerprints,&quot; which questions whether people are just too much alike to ever resolve their differences. Considering Simon's broken marriages, and his experiences in South Africa and Brazil, I guess he knows better than the rest of us.
0553266306|4.0|I really didn't like this book all that much. Not enough of of intrigue for me.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is a very intellegent movie, if you have any brains.  If not you will hate it.  You will hate if you are conservative too.  Conservatives, need to stop thinking the world is all for them and their shelterd ways.  There are people out there that probably go through things that are in this movie every day.  Carolyn and Lester remind me of my parents.  They make movies about God and church, why not make one about this?  Why conservatives, why?  I don't want to give anything away so I'll just talk about it.  Alan Ball is a genius.  Sam Mendes too.  The acting is exceptional.  This movie deserved every award it got, unlike Gladiator.  Most sheltered conservatives enjoyed Gladiator.  So if you are smart and not stuck up and stupid like most conservatives, you should buy this movie.
078322608X|5.0|This movie forces you to view it repeatedly, (I've seen it about some 30 times) but I don't know what's happened to me that I still haven't bought this wonderful movie. This movie is probably one of the most intelligent movies of the last decade, it plays with you, what's real, what's Cole's mind??? There's some time travelling that also tries to toy with you. And a great finale. I'm planning to buy this new DVD edition with DTS and a couple of extra things that they've added. WOW! Incredible movie. If you don't believe me rent it and you'll see what I'm talking about. You probably won't return the copy.
0553213105|5.0|I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it.  Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be.  The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society.  This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels.  Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture.
038542471X|5.0|There is plenty of suspense in this book, and it is very entertaining, one of my favorite Grisham novels. The protagonist, Mark Sway, is 11 and his life has been anything but easy. One day, he goes out into the woods near his house and witnesses the suicide of the lawyer of a man wanted for the murder of a US Senator, and the man tells him the location of the body. Suddenly Mark is surrounded by snakes:  the mob who want him quiet, and the prosecutors who want him to talk. His only ally is Reggie Love, a lawyer in her fifties who will fight for Mark and his family until the end. This is an electrifying reading experience and I read it in three days. Even if you do not like Grisham I think you should read this book.
B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream nation is one of those albums that your head just can't seem to process right away; especially if you've never heard a Sonic Youth album before.  That first listen can be painlfully boring as you meander through what may seem like hours of pointless noise as you wait for a familer guitar riff or vocal.  <br />But this is the true beauty and genius of DN.  After you've listned to the album enough times to familerize yourself with the territory you'll begin to notice that the lengthy distortion and noise passages are brillianlty crafted and are the real soul of the music.  Songs like Eric's Trip and Total Trash would be mediocre at best without the bands trademark sonic abberations.  The layers of guitar fuzz and effects help to underscore the burning urgency and passion that resonates with this album.  Some of the more conventionl songs like Candle or Kissiblility are a bit passive compared to the manic hyper-activness of 'Cross the breeze or explosive romp of Rain King.  <br />This album can truely excite and absorb you, but you have to be willing to listen.  The vast guitar textures are not backdrops, they have to be appreciated for their compostion and explosivness.
B000056VIY|5.0|This cd is great, especially &quot;ain't it funny&quot;, she has a good beat in it and great words.  But overall, you will love this cd, Jennifer is great at acting and singing alike!
B000001DZQ|5.0|Roy was the greatest guitarist ever. If you care to dispute that claim, please have the decency to delay your reaction untill you have listened to this compilation. The combination of skill and feeling dispayed on these discs is unmatched.I own well over 1,000 C.D.s, if I could only keep five, this would make the cut.
B00003CXMG|5.0|- &quot;What do you love about music? &quot;   - &quot; To begin with... Everything &quot; .<br />That's one of my favorites quotes of the film. <br />First of all know that I consider this movie along with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; the very best of 2000. Cameron Crowe really nailed this one. Smart and realistic dialogue, mood, story, feeling, and above all real emotion... they are all here. Every single actor and actress hit the right notes. If you forgot the reason of the existence of motion pictures then watch, live and experience this amazing and magical creation.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Most of you have probably viewed &quot;The professional&quot; or you wouldn't be looking for your own copy. This is better!  I watched the original and said: &quot;this is a good action movie, with a new plot twist... but it jumps around too much, and the characters are too thin!&quot; Well, this extra 24 minutes explains it all! From Leon's history and why he came to America, to what makes Natalie think she can take down the crooked cops all by herself. This is almost a different movie with all the new scenes (actually just extending what you already saw), but it truelly makes it better!
B00001ODHF|5.0|after the credits roll they show a different ending as well as the original trailer
0140072187|5.0|I would imagine that every person who reads this book will interpret it differently based on their own history and experiences. Being an ex-crewchief serving immediately after Mason left Viet Nam, I found this book both profoundly disturbing and cathartic at the same time. <br />Now I realize the truth, that the wounds of Viet Nam will probably never heal, for all participants - the foreigners (French/American), the \\"Enemy\\" (VC/NVA), the unwilling civilians, the ARVN, the refugees. It was just too ugly. It was just too much of a corruption of the human spirit. I had almost forgotten how disgusting it was. In a peculiar way reading this book has helped. Now I feel a little better, knowing that I wasn't crazy, jumping up in blind terror in the middle of the night . Or maybe I was crazy, but it's OK. Anyway after 20 or 30 years it gets better. <br />So what have we learned from all this? I think we've learned to displace ourselves from the suffering so we can still exact our deadly vengeance, but not lose sleep over it. Smart bombs. Surgical strikes. Death by video game. <br />What really scrambles people in situations like the Viet Nam war is not the observation of events outside of oneself, but the realization of how one's own psyche has somehow been corrupted by the process.
0679879269|5.0|I had waited anxiously for this book to come out, worrying all the time that it wouldn't live up to what I hoped it would be.  Thankfully, I was wrong.  Pullman masterfully pulls together the many threads he prepared in the first two books (which were no less wonderful) to weave a beautiful yet saddening tapestry of literary genius.  I understand why many people were bothered by the sad ending, having myself cried after finishing it, but I am at the same time glad that Mr. Pullman resisted the temptation to keep it going on and on.  It could easily have turned into another Harry Potter, spawning more and more movies and books and toys (and do we really want Pantalaimon plush dolls, with little microchips that make them talk? or a video game that features Will and Lyra in an all-out battle against another renagade angel? i certainly don't).  I am glad that this trilogy at least has not sold its soul to the big publishing houses as Harry Potter did.  I also believe that to read these books you must have an open mind.  I am disturbed by the fact that many of the reviewers that didn't like the book (which, might I add, is entirely your own choice) attacked the portrayal of the love between Lyra and Will.  What is life without love?  And when I say love, I mean love in all of its forms, not just love of God, if you believe in a God.  It is important that you have an open mind when reading this trilogy.  All in all, I feel that this trilogy is comparable to the Lord of The Rings (though I still feel that the Lord of the Rings is more enduring so far), and I think that this will go down in history.  Eat your heart out, J.K. Rowling.
0375501851|3.0|I agree with many of the reviewers.  This is a very well written debut novel.  However, after one stops being wowed by Smith's ability to write the book ceases to impress.  She tells some good tales and describes people well, but where is the plot, what is the point.  &quot;Abrupt&quot; does not sufficiently describe the end. There is no real attempt to tie anything together.  I wonder if those who elaborately praised this book, finished it.
B000009QPE|5.0|&quot;Auschwitz, the meaning the of pain, the way that I want you to die!&quot; When this lyric is screeched over your speakers, you know that you are in a place to which there is no return. This song is &quot;Angel of Death&quot; and this album is &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. The artist...The kings of speed metal, SLAYER. Sit back, and try to relax, and avoid being overloaded with simply the heaviest recording that I've had the pleasure of listening to.
B000002B1M|5.0|Anyone that thinks this album is any type of drop off or any lesser than Illmatic has issues.  Nas' follow up to his classic debut is fabulous.  Although it is not the exact same mold as Illmatic, it is still a classic itself.  While the mood and style is a little lighter and less rough, by no means is it soft.  There are very few featured artists on this album, which is another reason why I like it.  I can't remember the last time I've seen a rapper put out an album that didn't have like 20 guest appereances.  Although there are a few featured artists, such as Dr. Dre and Lauryn Hill, 95% of the album is still Nas.  This album is a must have for any Nas fan and most hip-hop fans.  Its different from Illmatic, but it is just as good.
B000002I25|4.0|The tracks on this album read like a list of The Doors' greatest hits.  And with good reason; they are some of the best.  Although Jim Morrison is often lambasted for masquerading as a poet, the lyrics on the first album are by far the least poetic.  In fact, they are fairly simplistic (with the exception of The End, which I never liked).  This album is a better introduction to the unique sound of The Doors -- that pulsating electric organ and Jim Morrison's sonorous voice.  You can succumb to the trend and buy a set of greatest hits, or you can begin with the earliest material and listen how the band evolved.
6304806442|5.0|If you are one of those people that likes movies about a cute guy falls in love with a cute girl, or bunch of grown up actors playing roles of high school kids with 5th grade jokes...this is not a movie for you. However, if you are looking for a movie that's not out there to please the popular audience but to show a vison in an artistic way that is not polluted by the influence of Hollywood.....go with Trainspotting
0393314804|5.0|It is no lie that I am usually untouched by contemporary literature, but this is an amazing book. I have read it several times, which is unique in itself. Although I love the movie, the book is more indepth. A lot of this book is written in a phonetic Scottish accent/dialect, including slang. This may be a little confusing at first, but it does not take long to adapt. And it adds so much to the novel. <br />The characters are so vivid and this book is just fascinating. I reread it after I understood the slang and the accent so that I could get as much out of it as possible. If you love the movie, I urge you to give the novel a try.
B00000F169|5.0|I saw this film years ago on T.V. and it tickled my insanity bone no end.  Quite simply it is a classic to end all classics, from the first moment you meet the four man crew on a 20 year mission who are as dysfunctional as they come, to the Captain who's dead but not really dead because his head is kept alive and he talks to the crew, not mention the suicidal Bomb No: 20 that wants to end it all and has to be talked out of detonating itself every so often.<br /><br />This is a movie that is an aquired taste, and you have to appreciate the tongue in cheek, the black humour and the total mickey of all things science fiction.<br /><br />It is quirky, crass, rude and totally irreverent, this is John Carpenter's brilliant portrayal of life above and beyond.  The ending is superb with the bomb getting its wish to end it all, and a crew member finding out that there is nothing cooler in the universe than using the bomb as a giant skateboard.  Wonderful, wonderful pulp science fiction that is ludicrous as it is poignant.
0393312836|5.0|This is one of my favorites. A linguistic classic, brilliantly written. I recommend this copy for, while it has no glossary, it does have the final chapter. American publishers who forced the 20 chapter copy of this book, did the world an injustice. The book, and subsequently, the movie is incomplete, and dare I say void of something. This is the something: Alex, our protagonist, is just that, and any understanding reader knows this but may not know why. How can we know when a novel and a film start and end in the same place? The final chapter fulfills this need for closure, thus transforming Alex into a round character, rather than a flat one, incapable of change. My only critiscism with this novel (including the final chapter) is that, at the end, like at the end of Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, we see conformity, for, in my view, no reason. Not to give it away, I will just discuss the part in question. Before Alex becomes a &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; he tells the reader that he loathes what is, in their society, pop music, and prefers &quot;Ludwig Van&quot; (Beethoven). The changes in the last chapter, has him abandon his earlier passion, in place of &quot;tamer&quot; music. This bothers me; perhaps i have misinterpreted this, but to me it makes a comment about civility and music. <br />Anyway, this is one of my favorite novels. It is a brilliant Pavlovian study of psychology (why we do what we do and what can control that) and the philosophy of free will, as well as the conflict between the proponents of free will and law enforcement and psychiatry. You will not read this book without having a lot to think about well after you close the pages of this book.
B00004C4L6|5.0|No, this is NOT your father's Tangerine Dream performing on their 1969 debut lp. What it is, however, is a meeting of 3 of Germany's most productive musicians ever. <br />Edgar Froese, the guitarist and founder, studied under famed artist Dali and proceeds to put together a unique combination of musicinas that eventually becomes Tangerine Dream. He meets up with avant-garde meistro Conrad Schnitzler (The Madman from Berlin), who adds his cellos and guitars to the mix. Add to the cauldron the amazing drummer (and later moog specialist) Klaus Schulze , and the mix is complete.<br />The results of their experimentations are sometimes uneven, mainly due to poor editing, but the music is unlike anything heard before or since. From the blaring of Schnitzler's cellos to Schulze's hypnotic and explosive drumming and Froese's freaked out guitar licks (and that's just on the first 2 tracks), &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot; takes off for the cosmos and never returns. On later tracks, add Froese's keyboards and moogs for added textures- the only partial sign of what would come later for the re-invented band. But on this lp, it is Schulze and Schnitzler that dictate the pace and orientation of the lp. It is pure psychedelia and avant-garde at once.<br />Schulze would leave the band shortly thereafter to help form another prominent band, Ash Ra Tempel, and later to a prolific career as the foremost master of the moog synthesizer on such classics as &quot;Cyborg,&quot; &quot;Timewind,&quot; and &quot;Irrlicht.&quot; Schnitzler would perform some on T. Dream's 2nd lp, &quot;Alpha Centuari,&quot; before quitting to form the anarchic trio Kluster with Moebius and Roedelius. Schnitzler has since recorded over 200 lps, by far the most prolific of Germany's musicians.<br />Froese, as we know, would re-invent Tangerine Dream as the moog and synth-driven band that created gems as &quot;Green Desert,&quot; &quot;Phaedra,&quot; and &quot;Stratosfear,&quot; but their 1st lp stands out as their most purely emotion driven and among their most innovative ever. It's an amazing listen that has to be heard many times to be believed. Pure passion and power. Cellos, fuzzed out guitars, Schulze's powerful drumming. Pure freak outs. An awesome lp.
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie does what few movies do nowadays: it teaches and compels thought. Whereas most blockbusters are soon forgotten, American Beauty will be with us forever. This is one of the few movies in recent years which has deserved its awards and acclaim. <br />It is the story of a typical middle aged man, Lester Burnham, and his dissatisfaction with his life. As Burnham rebels from societal norms, he cultivates a new appreciation for life. It is at the end of the film, when Burnham assures his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes, that she is anything but ordinary, that we realize, to many, Lester may seem ordinary, but to us he is anything but. The other powerful message, which always brings tears to my eyes, is the message about beauty in everything. <br />All of the actors are superb in this film. There are not words to describe Kevin Spacey and the feelings that he conjures up in us. Annette Benning, although I am not a fan of hers, did what needed to be done and, I guess acts well enough to always make me abhor her characters. Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley were all haunting supporting actors. <br />There is just too much to say about this movie. I beseech everyone to watch this film and see what all the talk is about. &quot;You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday.&quot;
0425152251|5.0|Anyone who's tried to learn philosophy knows that it's boring, right? Well, here's an idea: Read Sophie's World! It's philosophy at its finest, and to top it off, there's a whole ton of fantasy! It's a bit of a long read, but trust me, it's worth it! This is also a great read for those who can't find anything to read after the Harry Potter books... Overall, just read it, and you'll be happy you did!
0316926345|5.0|Brideshead Revisited is one of my favorite books of all time. Alas, this, being my first journey into the mind of Evelyn Waugh, has ruined me for his other novels as they are not very similar to this one. This book, for me, has had a magical aura. It was written Post World War I, as a treatise to the past, which explains the grand departure from style and content from other novels.  Charles Ryder returns to the Brideshead estate, releasing memories of his school days and his friendship with the exquisite Sebastian Flyte. <br />This novel also carries an extreme theme of Catholicism and a family's attempt to flee from the faith of their mother. Like an unwoven spider web, the children, Sebastian, Julia, and Cordelia eventually become ensnared and return to the religion their mother showed them when they were children.<br />This is an amazing novel. Whimsical and sad, at once. This is a must-read.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Hearing humming and a guitar as an intro is going to catch your attention and seeing &quot;Video&quot; will glue you to the television. Here we have a &quot;sister&quot; letting us know its alright to be &quot;natural&quot;. Arie has a true story to tell in each song and each track has its own identity demanding us to listen to and feel it. Arie gives much respect to those who paved the way before her and allows us to relate with many of them through her &quot;soulful&quot; sound.  You won't be able to focus on just the lyrics, whether its the mellow sound of the guitar and vocals or the strong backbeats, Arie is going to grab you somehow. Although i know her cd will encourage &quot;all&quot; women to think positve, her cd will have great influence on African-american women to teach us to love and repect ourselves and our &quot;BROWNSKIN&quot;.        porsha ... a soulful fan
0060278234|4.0|Like others, I found Garth Nix' Sabriel to be a sleeper -- in fact, I think it was one of the best fantasy books in the last 10 years. If you haven't read it, go back and get it!<br /><br />However, I was disappointed with Lirael, largely due to expectations set by the author in earlier works, and by the publisher in marketing the book.<br /><br />First and foremost, all the other Garth Nix books that I've read were relatively stand-alone, and though this book said that it was a sequel to the stand-alone Sabriel, nothing was said that it was the middle of a trilogy. In fact, the book is the first of a duology, and unlike any other book by Garth Nix, it comes to an incomplete and unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />The only major \\"mystery\\" set up and revealed at the end of the book is spoiled by looking at the cover of the book and/or reading the description of the main character. All the other mysteries of the book await the conclusion of the final book Abhorsen.<br /><br />I also found the male character whiny and unsympathetic. I understand why the author made him this way, but didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say buy both Lirael and Abhorsen together. Thiss book is still better then average, but will be disapointing both to a fan and to someone newly arrived to the trilogy.
B000050FEN|5.0|then you missed the point.<br />1) This movie is a study in contrast!<br />Morgan Freeman is an older, black, unmarried man on his last case; Brad Pitt is young, white, married and on his first case. The constant noise outside is a contrast to the quite voices of the cast. The chaotic music at the beginning and end contrasts the classical played at other times. The beauty of the library contrasts the horror of the crime scene photos. Parts of the script are writen in stone and parts are ad-libbed, ie... Pitt in the car w/ Spacey...Etc ...<br />2) Seven (7) is a concluding number. The case lasts for 7 days with 7 victims of the 7 deadly sins. At the end, at 7 pm, it's light outside, July (7), etc, etc...<br />3) The symbolism is thick. Everyone is wearing black and/or white. The first case is in the dark (evil/the unknown) and the end in is full day-light, truth/knowledge. Spacey is covered in blood and then wears red, symbolic blood. And on, and on...<br />This movie is brilliant. If you didn't get it I feel sorry for you. And if you thought the plot had holes in it then you missed the point.<br />Get this DVD! There's nothing else like it!
B00004OCRN|5.0|I would buy this album JUST for the &quot;Born to Run&quot; on it and I would pay the price of a regular CD for it. I have never in my life heard a song so intense and so beautiful as that song performed on this CD. It gives me chills up my spine every time I hear it and it makes me cry every time those last few lines are chanted into the night.
0792156684|4.0|What James Cameron's TITANIC proves once and for all is that, with the right creative team, you don't need tonnes of money to make a great picture.  The look of the film is amazing; its period detail and grand ocean vistas make this a widescreen must.  Still, the main reason for the picture's success is the adept handling of its love story; this really is as close to a big-screen homage of THE LOVE BOAT as we are likely to get.  (I kept looking for Gopher or Isaac, the bartender, to show up in cameos, but they never do).  While the overall excellence of the film is beyond question, I feel it was a mistake to sink the ship.  This movie was hugely popular when first released, so there was definitely an audience for a sequel, (or two).  Critics may argue otherwise, but moviegoers prefer a happy ending.
B000007SPU|4.0|As on the stunning debut &quot;It'll end in tears&quot;, 4AD label owner Ivo and long-time producer John Fryer follow their predilection for creating music which fuses many different styles and moods, often drawing from neo-classical and chamber music. Surprisingly, &quot;F&amp;S&quot; is not a mere rehash of the previous collection, as TMC have obviously taken a different path this time: Instead of the usual song sequencing where the individual tracks lead their separate lives, TMC constructed the album as a series of 'normal' songs which are seamlessly held together by short fragments, incidental mood pieces, landscapes of floating sounds, orchestral arrangements, or even some industrial drum loops. The blurring of lines between song and sound, between reality and fiction, pushes the album into an realm of otherworldly beauty and intrigue and bears the effort of endless hours in the studio. At times, the concept did remind me of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, and there are really a few elements --  such as the circling helicopter in &quot;Thais 1/2&quot; -- which are directly taken from this mega-work. The outstanding musician on &quot;F&amp;S&quot; is multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde, who took some time out from the Cocteau Twins while 'the other two' were working on &quot;Victorialand&quot;. Raymonde delivers a breathtakingly beautiful ambient instrumental with &quot;Ivy and neet&quot;, clearly inspired by piano player and ambient master Harold Budd: It begins with dark, slow piano chords and ominous atmospherics drifting in an ocean of delay and reverb, then adds some gentle saxophone before it fades away into nothingness and loneliness. The other instrumental tracks in the album's first half also have enough ideas for their length, such as the bright guitar chords of &quot;Meniscus&quot;, the orchestral interlude of &quot;Tears&quot; and the ethnic drumming of &quot;At first..&quot;, the latter being played by DCD's percussionist. The vocal pieces also manage to shine, most notably the Appleton-sung &quot;The jeweller&quot;, the rock-inspired &quot;Strength of strings&quot;, and &quot;Morning glory&quot; with its powerful piano line and playful synth accompaniment. And then, some rather odd things happen: First comes the avant-garde string arrangement of &quot;Inch-blue&quot;, followed by the fragile and wonderful &quot;I want to live&quot;. But &quot;Mama k1&quot; with its industrial drum loops (which are more in line with, say, Nitzer Ebb and Front 242) breaks the mood, and the noisy title track features too many disconnected sounds sharing the space, some discordant, some melodic. Unfortunately, this pattern occurs a few times in the album's second half, but there are enough good tracks to counteract the dismal ones and prevent the album from getting tangled in its own loose web: &quot;A heart..&quot; slowly evolves from hard-hitting drum loops to menacing drones and waves of ambient sounds, while the musically very psychedelic &quot;Firebrothers&quot; provides another showcase for the mysterious vocalist Richenel. The awkward moments come with the cover version of Colin Newman's &quot;Alone&quot; and the utterly dire &quot;Drugs&quot; (originally recorded by The Talking Heads); both songs kick in with relentless beats and rather vitriolic vocals, but this style simply doesn't fit with the rest of the record . Thankfully, Raymonde turns in another superb performance on &quot;Red rain&quot;, where his typically throbbing bass and exquisite melodies provide a convincing bed for Seaman's totally triumphant vocals. Honestly, this track is as good as any mid-'80s song by the Cocteau Twins and flows gracefully into &quot;Thais 2&quot;, another excellent ambient soundscape which concludes the album on an unpredictably peaceful note. Though &quot;F&amp;S&quot; is not as successful at finding the right balance of styles and moods as the project's first album was, there's nevertheless an impressive selection to choose from, and most people will find a lot of pieces to enjoy. Having said that, I do understand where some of the criticism comes from: There are a few cuts which border on unlistenable, and the vocal compositions are not as strong as those of TMC's other records, perhaps due to the lack of a really distinguished singer like Liz Fraser or Gordon Sharp. Still, the album's impressive ambitions and its unorthodox structure, which is more allied to efforts by Pink Floyd or Yes,  make it an essential item for your record collection.rom, and most people will find a lot of pieces to enjoy.

B00003CXN4|1.0|My streak continues...  If critics like it, I hate it.  This movie has been hyped by the media because it is politcally correct.  The entertainment value of this movie is zero.  I got bored throughout and probably would have left if I was not with a group of people.  Come to find out we all thought the movie was a waste of money.
B00004YM0D|5.0|After seeing this great movie I had to have the soundtrack !!! It is wonderful!! It brought back so many memories of my teenage years in the 70's. I was disapointed though that James Taylor's &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; was not on the cd. This is a great &quot;feel good&quot; cd that will live on for a long, long time.

The video is very good, although there are not a lot of dark scenes. The dark scenes tend to be the most affected by poor transfer quality. Matted widescreen. French. Extras? Nope, but the movie is pretty good, so for the price, this is a good DVD.

0393307050|5.0|&quot;Master and Commander&quot; is the first of the Aubrey/Maturin series, which takes place on the high seas during the Napoleonic wars. While I loved this novel for its rich historical flavor, what really appealed to me was the dramatic conflict between the young master and commander, Aubrey and his second in command, Dillon. <br />It is clear that Dillon hates Aubrey for a number of reasons that seem ineffable even to him. Both men are similar in age and it is not surprising that Dillon judges Aubrey with competitive criticism, frequently finding him too cautious or even cowardly. But Dillon is an even harsher judge of his own character. Like Maturin, Dillon participated in an ill-fated uprising in his native Ireland. He subsequently avoided capture and joined the Royal Navy where life would be perfectly suitable for him if his duties did not occasionally require him to search for and arrest Irish nationalists. The conflict between loyalty to his nation and loyalty to the Royal Navy instills Dillon with considerable self-hatred, which in turn manifests itself in his contempt for his commander. Aubrey, already a simple man by nature, senses Dillon's hatred but is incapable of probing the depths to understand its origin.<br />To make matters more difficult, Aubrey has earned the hatred of his own commanding officer by having an affair with his wife. These matters are eventually resolved through a series of raids and sea battles and a few surprises for the reader. <br />Exciting and worth reading-the series only gets better.

B00004XONN|5.0|Buy the CD, and flip to song 8. Turn the volume up real loud.<br />Sit down.<br />Listen.<br />After about 5:05, the song is officially finished. What you have just heard is one of the best songs Radiohead has ever created. I'm so serious! I can feel the mad replies right now. Ahh, what the heck -- everything about this song (oh yeah, it's called &quot;Idioteque&quot;) is genius. The same beat, the background noises, and the simple keyboard riff going on and off like a broken record. Not to mention Thom's amazing voice weaving through the already amazing song. And that's just one song.<br />Wait until you hear track 03, &quot;The National Anthem.&quot; It could definetely just be noise passing through your ears -- but, really, listen to it. Several times. Or track 07. Or for that matter, track 09. Or the riviting &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;<br />People will constantly be rejecting it -- &quot;It's SO different from OK Computer!&quot; or something like &quot;It's weird...&quot; ..well of course it is on first listen. And also the horrible, nasty comment &quot;It's not Radiohead.&quot; -- If you hated this album, then you're certaintly going to dislike the upcoming &quot;Amnesiac&quot; -- it has the same tone as &quot;Kid A,&quot; and for crying out loud, was recorded in the same time period.<br />And while track 06, &quot;Optimistic,&quot; is the most conventional Radiohead song -- that certaintly doesn't mean it is the best.<br />It IS a departure for Radiohead. That's why I like &quot;OK Computer&quot; as much as &quot;Kid A&quot; -- because I can listen to them both back to back and hear two different albums. If &quot;Kid A&quot; was more of &quot;OK Computer,&quot; then it would be a bit boring.<br />I love Radiohead. They have made my life, musically, at least, better. I had always had problems trying to indentify with music... and it was a year or so back when I stumbled on them. I can't get enough of them either. What a special time it is for Radiohead fans -- two albums released in less than a year.<br />Alas, &quot;Kid A&quot; is probably going to appeal to people of all tastes, or fair tastes -- if you're the kind who won't give their CDs a few listens, then this probably not for you.
B00004SA8A|5.0|This set is a reissue of recordings of Schubert's piano sonatas made in the 1970's. For me this is Kempff's greatest contribution to classical music on record or cd. <br />Kempff is the master of the poetic, unforced and unhurried interpretation, which lets the music speak for itself and extracts its joys and sorrows in a seemingly effortless and loving fashion. His attention to the essential unity of the music, as well as its color and polyphonic strands beneath the surface, is unmatched. (Perhaps this is because he began his career as an organist). Kempff's sometimes humble, sometimes playful and always direct approach makes him the perfect interpreter of Schubert's phrasing, and offers a delightful and refreshing change from the glitzy showmanship seemingly favored by the pounding technicians of today. <br />To listen to the sonata D.568 is not just to hear Schubert, it is to welcome a gentle, happy, spring breeze in to your living room. This is first and foremost music which is at ease and yet at times appeals to the depths of the soul in simple, direct terms, absent all pretense. Listen, for example, to the sad beauty of the second movement of the sonata, D959!<br />For my money this is the finest set of Schubert piano sonatas we are ever likely to see. Don't miss this one!
0782008372|4.0|Many of the reviews of this Highlander DVD claim it is terrible quality and is unwatchable. I think that is highly exaggerated. This DVD was not made with much care, especially when it boasts a THX remastering (i guess Lucas's team slacked on this one). But it is not that bad. I found it very watchable and only noticed some fuzziness now and then. The soundtrack isn't done that well (the dialogue is too low and the music by queen is too high), but this really isn't that big a deal. Unless you're a hardcore Highlander fan i doubt you'll notice or care about any of these faults. This was probably the cheapest DVD i've ever gotten (it was like 7 bucks), and for that price it was well worth it. Sure, it's not made as well as it could have been, but it's also not as expensive as it could have been either. The quality is good enough and its faults are really not that bad, it is certainly worth the low price.
B000056NX4|2.0|When I saw the promo for this video on my copy of &quot;Cats&quot;, I was very excited.  I love the soundtrack to Jesus Christ Superstar, and found Norman Jewison's 1973 movie version lacking.<br />Unfortunately, this 2000 production is just as flawed.  It is, in its own way, every bit as dated, and Glenn Carter's portrayal of Christ is even less charismatic than Ted Neeley's<br />Jerome Pradon, as Judas, has a marvelously expressive face and brings the role the depth it needs.  However, his singing voice is not Broadway quality.  <br />Except for Fred Johanson as Pilate, no-one's vocals come close to the original Broadway or London casts, and most even fall short of the cast from the 1973 movie version.<br />I am terribly disappointed.  There is no need to modernize this  musical. The 1973 movie slipped back and forth between being about modern actors doing a Passion Play and actually being about Jesus' life.  This version's conceit seems to be &quot;What if Jesus came back today?&quot;, but the guns, graffiti, glitz and &quot;Jesus Rules&quot; flyers add nothing, and will soon seem at least as dated as the '70's stuff does now.  <br />While the video version of &quot;Cats&quot; dressed up the just-OK music in the best version possible, this video takes a great play and makes it tawdry and boring.<br />I'll stick to listening to the soundtrack and visualizing a perfect version in my head!
B00000IAU3|4.0|I was pleased to see Dido shot to fame. Her debut album is fast becoming a hit pretty much everywhere. Here voice has been compared to Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O'Conner, and good ol Alanis Morrisette for song writing. It seems everybody gets compared to Alanis when you write songs about bad relationships. Although the lyrics can be regarded as a bit of a downer, the music, which has a bit more bass n stuff than the names above, helps lift it up again.<br />As some of you may know Dido has a brother called Rollo, who helped produce the album. However he is member of the band Faithless, which Dido has done a fair amount of vocal work for. Within the two Faithless albums you can hear what has progressed into Dido's debut album - check out the beginning `Postcards' from Sunday 8pm and you will here the chorus to `My Lover's Gone'.  <br />With all this experience and Eminem's `Stan' plus a high rating TV theme (Roswell) - well it's no wonder she is the next big thing. I bet Dido's agent is gaining as much popularity as she is.
B000001EG6|2.0|This is where it all started..well, if you don't count &quot;Empty Sky&quot;. I love Elton John's music, I have for a long time, and this album is essential, but it's not one of my favorites..&quot;Your Song&quot; is still a nice touch, while &quot;I Need You To Turn To&quot; scores more points(check out the &quot;Live In Australia&quot; version), but &quot;Take Me To The Pilot&quot;, this version of it is pretty horrid. It doesn't sound as catchy as it would on different live releases. &quot;No Shoe Strings On Louise&quot; is one of the better songs on here, with a definite Stones influence; &quot;First Episode At Hienton&quot; makes me feel like jumping out of a window; &quot;Sixty Years On&quot;, while not a terrible song, the strings are too much at times; &quot;Border Song&quot;, again, sounds better live; &quot;Greatest Discovery&quot;, a touching song, but one I don't find myself indulging in too much, &quot;The Cage&quot;, filler; &quot;The King Must Die&quot;, there is something somewhat moving about this one, but it is still overblown. As for the bonus tracks, &quot;Bad Side Of The Moon&quot; is overproduced; &quot;Grey Seal&quot;, I kinda like it, though I can't tell you why; &quot;Rock N'Roll Madonna&quot; is a catchy, Jerry Lee Lewis type rocker. To sum it all up, I think all of Elton's &quot;Classic Years&quot; albums are worth having, including this one, but this is my least favorite, with the possible exceptions of &quot;Caribou&quot; and &quot;Empty Sky&quot;. I think the strings present the biggest problem on this album..just overly dramatic in a lot of places, and a little hollow at times as well. If you want to hear the strings put to good use, check out &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot;.
B000059ZT4|4.0|Universal Music, the mega-company that seems to have eaten and digested dozens of other labels, has issued an expanded and remastered versions of the landmark reggae album &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; by the Wailers.  While the music has never sounded better, there are some significant and fundamental problems with this release.<br />  Except perhaps for the soundtrack album to the film &quot;The Harder They Come,&quot; the Wailers' &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; (1973) was the first reggae album that most listeners outside of Jamaica ever heard. The group had been together in some form for a decade and had enjoyed a long series of Jamaican hit singles.  They had also moved easily from r&amp;b to ska before becoming one of the earliest reggae acts.  Although Bob Marley wrote and sang most of the songs, it was by no means his band.  Peter Tosh also was a major contributor, and Marley, Tosh and Bunny Livingston (a/k/a Bunny Wailer) had been bandmates from the beginning, and their vocal blend was striking and beautiful.<br />  Island Records' founder and president Chris Blackwell had long followed the Jamaican music scene.  When he heard the powerful results of the Wailers' '72 sessions he was ready to spring reggae on the rest of the world.  Between this decision and the music's actual release, though, Blackwell got cold feet, and altered most of the tracks in London by judiciously and tastefully overdubbing rock keyboards, guitar and backing vocals in an apparent attempt to make the tracks more accessible to rock-oriented listeners.  Whether these alterations were necessary, or even a good idea, &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; found an audience in England, the U.S. and elsewhere and became a modest hit.  Although the original band broke up a year or so (and one album) later when Tosh and Livingston left, Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers were on their way to international stardom.<br />  &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; (Deluxe Edition) makes available for the first time the original unadulterated recordings from the 1972 sessions, and they are really a revelation.  These versions are rawer but more powerful; its as if a sonic gauze has been removed, revealing the true nature of the music for the first time.  These tracks have an immediacy that was lacking in the originally released versions, and long-time fans of Marley and the Wailers will feel as if they've stumbled upon the Holy Grail of reggae.  There are also two previously unreleased songs that fans will find worth hearing and owning.<br />  The remastered version of the original album, overdubs and all, is also here and sounds better than ever.  Such Marley classics as &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot; still retain their appeal.  Its worth noting, though, that two of the album's most powerful songs, &quot;400 Years&quot; and &quot;Stop That Train,&quot; are written and sung by Peter Tosh.  Tosh was one of reggae's greatest artists, and its a shame that his reputation seems diminished largely because he was so overshadowed by badmate Marley.<br />  The major problem with this release, and one that may make you think twice about purchasing it, is that there is barely eighty minutes of music on this two-disk set, which sells for the full price of two CDs.  The Wailers recorded extensively in the period before &quot;Catch A Fire,&quot; and perhaps some of those tracks (many of which are excellent) could have been licensed by Universal for inclusion here.  Another option would have been dropping one of the two outtakes and fitting it all on one disk.  Serious fans of Marley and the Wailers will purchase this package without a second thought, but more casual fans might do better to seek out the earlier, budget-priced CD issue of &quot;Catch A Fire.&quot;  The booklet of the Deluxe Edition includes all the original artwork and some nice and rare photos, as well as song lyrics, but the essay is second-rate and disappointing.<br />  In the last few months Universal has issued such classics as &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot; in similar &quot;Deluxe Editions&quot; at a premium price.  While there was a  significant amount of previously unheard material in those two releases to justify their purchase, the paucity of new music here makes this feel like a bit of a rip-off.  Its too bad, because &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; is a classic that deserves better treatment.
6305078564|5.0|I loved Pride and Prejudice! The movie focused on the main bits without losing too much of the non-essentials to the story. It was a very magical film with very authentic buildings, props and costumes. The acting was superb and all of the actors and actresses portrayed their characters very well indeed. To understand the story even more I suggest you read the book.

B00003CXR1|4.0|It's a decent French film from 1988 by the director Claire Denis about a French woman returning to colonial West Africa to remember her past.  Complex film about interracial relationships and the past.  It's a bit slow moving and not the fantasy jaunt that the new film of the same name is.  But it's enjoyable.  Take this is a warning and do not think this is the same movie or even same story as the 2000 film of the same name.
0312243022|5.0|The Hours, Michael Cunningham's fourth book, is an amazing read. Through the tales of four women - three &quot;real&quot;, and one fictional - Cunningham has showed us the interrelationships of life, and how experiences stay the same, even while changing, from generation to generation.<br />The book centers around the stories of three women: Virginia Woolf, an author writing a story about Mrs. Dalloway; Mrs. Brown, a housewife in California in 1949, and Clarissa &quot;Dalloway,&quot; a writer caring for a close friend suffering from AIDS.  These women seem to live separate lives; yet at the end their experiences intersect profoundly and in an important way.<br />I had never read Virginia Woolf, and it did not diminish my enjoyment of the story itself.  However, I do think that I perhaps missed some of the literary foreshadowing early in the book.<br />When I began reading this story, I admit I didn't understand it. The stories seemed disjointed, and I didn't &quot;get&quot; where the author was going.  But by the end, I was struck by the beauty of the book and the author's masterful revealing of his concept.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|R.E.M. had &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, Lou Reed had &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; and Dire Straits had &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, timeless anthems all. Great tunes, a story to tell and you can listen to them over and over and they are always fresh and appealing. &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; is clearly the highlight of this album but the rest of the songs here are by no means embarrassed to be in its company. <br />Dire Straits formed amidst the punk rock boom that was rejecting the overblown musical styles of the mid seventies. They were rejected by many record companies because they were not punk but that missed the point of their music. They were re-injecting the timeless Blues essentials that had been discarded by the bands against which punk was rebelling. The opening track &quot;Down To The Waterline&quot; sets the tone for the CD and, while subsequent tracks raise and lower the tempo, the style is coherent all the way through.<br />When you listen to this CD it is almost a shock that it is a band's debut release. It is so well put together that you might imagine that it is the magnum opus of a band who have been recording together for a decade. The CD has the immediate appeal of clear memorable songs but with enough depth to reward repeated listening.<br />Mark Knopfler comes over as a man who has his guitar style all worked out ready for the band's debut. Arguments about who is the world's finest guitarist are unresolvable but without doubt, he is a candidate for the elite group.<br />If you have not heard this album before, listen to &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; and rest assured that the other songs here will not disappoint you. This CD deserves a place alongside Lou Reed's &quot;Transformer&quot; and R.E.M.'s &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; in any collection of mainstream rock music.
6305311463|3.0|Not a film I would have gone out of my way to see, I picked this up because I got it cheap, and I was curious what redeeming qualitites might have possessed Criterion to produce it. I expected to watch it and get rid of it, but this is definitely a keeper! The director's history in TV commercials, and his clear inability to do anything else, are evident throughout. I think no take in the film lasts more than three seconds, and a huge number of those look like they were lifted from ads for  AT&amp;T or Pampers. No action-flick cliche was spared in the story line, nor any opportunity for an explosion that made no sense. Laughed out loud throughout. There is no suspense of any kind (you can write down the entire story after watching the first ten minutes), but the combination of light-hearted humor and really-bad-movie excess make for a very enjoyable time. I've only made it through part of the commentary material, but am enjoying listening to the technical consultants point out the technical errors that I missed on first viewing.<br />As for those who think it was inappropriate for Criterion to waste their time on this when they could be restoring some decent film, recall that they have produced other junk films like Blood of Dracula and The Night Porter as examples of their genres. I think a -really- bad big-budget Hollywood film like this has a place too. Now as for doing it again with &quot;The Rock,&quot; I agree, I wish they had done Ikiru first....
B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous is a charming movie with heart and soul rarely found in today's mire of blockbusters. I found Almost Famous appealing on many different levels, and while it wasn't a tremendously funny film, I wore a snug smile continually while watching it.<br />On one level, it's a great movie about a talented and earnest teenager commissioned by Rolling Stone Magazine to write a feature on a rock band called Stillwater (they don't know he's only fifteen, of course). His name is William Miller, and he has become liberated from the vehement values of his mother through rock music. He develops a passion for it, and his role as a young rock critic garners the attention of Rolling Stone. On the road with the band, he meets (and becomes infatuated with) Penny Lane, a groupie whose character (played by the lovely Kate Hudson) is heartbreakingly delicate. She tries to rationalize her existence and rejects the notion of being emotionally damaged by this fantasy world lacking morality.  William is saddened by how Russell (Stillwater's guitarist) treats her, and helps her out in the end. William also befriends the aforementioned guitarist Russell, and their developing relationship allows them both to learn from each other.<br />On an ancillary level, it's a movie about rock music. During William's travels with the band, the band scores with a successful record, endures battles of ego, and goes through management changes. Although Stillwater is a fictional band, the script and director's canny sense of time and the business could trick you into thinking they were real. It's about the pragmatics versus of ideals of the industry. It's about a critic's integrity, the cruelties of the biz, and more.<br />Why this movie is so wonderful is that it's a great movie about growing up. William's exploits with the band parallel coming-of-age for most teenagers. He is a starry-eyed idealist who witnesses the broken hearts and inclemency of the real world, yet still steadfastly clutches at confidence and optimism. William is a smart kid, and his character is very well-acted with the right amounts of naivet&eacute; and youthful exuberance to add credence to his role. Great, great movie.onfidence and optimism.

B000001ESP|5.0|I was really tired when I wrote this; forgive me if it...ahem, goes astray... :-)<br />Rush's &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; is what is known in progressive rock circles as the &quot;Perfect Album.&quot; <br />I would agree. <br />This Canadian power trio are remarkably adept at creating not just epics, but on Moving Pictures, epics clocking in at under 5 minutes. That a prog fan like myself is not turned off by such short songs is a testament to the power and craftsmanship of each song, in both its lyrical and musical content. <br />The subject matter on Moving Pictures covers traditional and contemporary issues, from &quot;modern-day warriors&quot; (Tom Sawyer) and Sunday races with granddad (Red Barchetta), to Toronto time zones (YYZ) and ignorance (Witch Hunt). <br />The addition of synthesizers adds another facet to the Rush sound, giving the songs a weightier, fuller, tastier, fresh, futuristic feel.<br />Neil Peart's drumming is outstanding, with odd time sigs invading even the most radio-friendly songs, such as the memorable riff in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and the guitarist's wet dream, the catchy, &quot;YYZ.&quot; Even casual listeners are unfazed. His rhythms power and propel the fast-paced tunes, even introducing world music and reggae-flavored grooves, rolls, fills, and licks.<br />The music is all around outstanding, with mind-blowing string work by Alex Lifeson, and virtuosic keys and bass playing by vocalist Geddy Lee. They are helped in no small part by the flawless production, courtesy of Terry Brown. Simply mah-velous is all I can say -- you have to listen to understand how simply tight the recording is. Ah, if only today's music were so meticulously crafted. <br />When people ask me to give them suggestions on outstanding music to check out, there are very few bands and records on my mental list of such music. Rush is one of those very few bands.<br />Moving Pictures is one of those very few records.

B000002B7O|5.0|Many will argue that this album is far worse than Blizzard of Ozz, but taking into consideration that is follows one of the greatest ever made, I believe it deserves recognition. With uplifting songs like Flying High Again (no pun intended), Believer, and Little Dolls, who could refuse a listen? I'm honestly surprised that my copy has not melted from excess use. Bottom line: a must have for all good Ozzy fans.
B00004YKUY|5.0|15 songs on one C.D. all great tunes. Some sound like classic Journey, some mellow,some rock all good. Steve Perry who? Journey is back with a vengence.This CD will put them back on the map along with their summer tour.Arrival has the stuff to be classi. Great party,driving and concert music. Welcome Back Journey,you have ARRIVED.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|all i can say is, you must buy this television series pronto!! i'm from london, and i watched this series when it was first aired. i, like most people, was amazed by the intelligence of the script and the acting. yes, there was frontal nudity, and sex scenes, but your completely oblivious to this because you become so absorbed with the characters and all of their emotions. this oirginal british version of the show is far more gritty and well oserved. the american version is far more about the actors being &quot;beautiful&quot; and the show being &quot;camp&quot;. the british version is set in rural manchester and all the characters seem completely real, and thats why the show works better.
6302902010|5.0|This two-tape opera version was indeed superb but it clearly doesn't come even close to the long-sought-after all-time-classic rarity of director Otto Preminger's 1959 film version of Porgy And Bess....produced by Samuel Goldwyn. Yes, the 1959 film is definitely the one you've been looking for....the one starring Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters and Diahann Carroll....featuring the music of the incomparable George Gershwin....the film which, of course, won Academy Awards for music directors Andr Previn and Ken Darby. And now....with Dorothy Dandridge: Little Girl Lost having been featured on A&amp;E's Biography....as well as the much-acclaimed Introducing Dorothy Dandridge not only having made its debut on HBO....but also the amazing Halle Berry having won her most highly-deserved Golden Globe Award as well as her most impressively-earned Emmy Award....1959's Porgy And Bess will certainly become even more of a pursued rarity than ever before! For all those who are major fans of and are interested in discussing....and/or viewing....the 1959 film version....in both the full-screen pan-and-scan format....and also in the awe-inspiring widescreen letterboxed format....please feel free to E-Mail me at porgyandbess1959@freeze.com!
B0000019PA|5.0|i don't need to describe this album any further as it has been well done by others before me. all i want to say is this album is one of those that does something to you when you listen to it. i know it back to front and inside out. the things that got me hooked are the simple chord patterns - major (happy) chords with some of the saddest most beautiful vocal imagery imaginable, mangum's eerie pirate like voice that rings in your head for days (nay, forever), the plethora of exotic instruments, the overpowering dynamics. this is definitely one of my most listened to and favourite albums. it's the first album i'd recommend to anyone i meet that loves music. it's a must have...trust me.
B000059PRW|5.0|This was a good movie, and pretty much meets the standars of the first one, which by the way I gave a 4/5. I must say though, I give this one a 5, just for the reason of the sencond story, &quot;The Raft&quot; it is about a group of teens who go out and sit on a raft for no reason and a substance that swims in the water is trying to eat them. The first which has to be the worst in the movie is about an indian that owns a shop and 2 other indians break in and kill them and steal stuff, the worst one on the movie! The thrid and final story in about a man that is hitchhiking, and a woman who just came from a, let's say close friends house, hit's him trying to rush home to her husband, he, of course, comes back from the dead and stalks her until she gets home. This movie gets a 5 out of 5, for the thought put into it.
B000002KGT|5.0|on saturday night live, mike myers in his wayne's world skit, made a jibe about so many people owning rumours...&quot; it was like the mailman delivering boxes of tide detergent to your house...&quot;<br />     it's the third biggest selling album in history for a reason...the songs are great...few artists know how to use their anger and passions and turn them  into something creative and beautiful, able to stand the test of time...i heard courtney love sing a version of  &quot; gold dust woman. &quot; while her song rocks, i like stevie nicks' version a little more...all the players on this album contributed...but stevie is special...before alanis, liz phair, pj harvey,and tori amos, rock had stevie nicks...
B00000JR29|3.0|The original of this album is a classic, of course. But the new material not only doesn't improve it--it actually makes the record worse. There are seven new &quot;songs&quot; on this, but five of them are really electronic noodlngs that weren't good enough to be put out. They're quite boring, actually, and represent a marked letdown from the quality of the album's original tracks. <br />The two remix tracks are nothing special, though the version of Shout is kinda fun.  So if you already have Songs from the Big Chair, no need to buy this...
B00003CXB2|4.0|Most people looking at this review of Lawrence will have seen the movie in the cinema and probably own the VHS version. I would recommend to these people that they buy the DVD! Unlike most DVD's there appears to be nothing to choose between the region one and two versions. The outside package of region one is better but you then have to put up with the booklet being loose in the box, region two is not quite as well presented but the booklet and fly sheet are better presented. The film is superb and I would suggest viewing on a projection TV.
0930289234|5.0|Rorshach is quite a character. And Night Owl, and the others make you wonder... what do 'super' heros do when they get old. How do the adjust to being mere mortals when youth abandons them? Wonderful book. 5 out of 5. No hesitations. BUY THIS, because you do  want to know who killed the Comedian... don't you?
6305335745|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I rented it, I like every story of the four, except for the last one about the guy who was afraid of bugs. It was pointless, and any scary story that deals with royalty is STUPID. The first story is about a woman who killed her father, because he kept nagging her to get his cake, so she killed him. The second is the best one, it stars Stephen King as a hick that finds an astroid he touches it, and after that everything he touches turns to grass. The third stars Leslie Nielsen (Prom Night, The Naked Gun) it is probably the second best story, it's about a guy who buries a couple up to their neck in send by the lake, and when a tidal wave comes in... well... you know what would happen. And the last is just plain stupid. I give this movie a 4 out of 5, it could have had a 5 but the last story was just too stupid!
B000003TA4|5.0|this is definitely one of the best albums out,losing nirvana was like losing a piece of rock n roll.This album is not just heavey strumming its in parts soft&quot;polly&quot;The album contains the catchy single&quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;other standout tracks would be&quot;come as you are,lithium,in bloom,drain you and on a plane.every rock fan has to have this album because it's top.(similar bands include greenday and offspring)
B000002AGE|1.0|Unfortunately (for this album) I already owned - and was very fond of - &quot;Celebrating the Music of the Weather Report&quot;.  The musical style in &quot;Heavy&quot; is just what the name implies - heavy (even irrritating in comparison to the same pieces in &quot;Celebrating&quot;).  &quot;Celebrating&quot; is a nice departure from the &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;.  Save your money for it.
B000002LEE|5.0|This album is a masterpiece plain and simple. I have been a Jane's fan for a looooong time now (mid 80's). This album has yet to be eclipsed on my list of great alternative records. I think it's better than Ritual... by a long shot. The only other album by any artist that even comes close for me is &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magic&quot; by RHCP.
B00002Z88D|5.0|From the first time I heard this album just after it was released, to the time I saw the whole concert on DVD, to right f'n now, I've never been able to put my feelings to words.  While combining rock and roll music with a symphony orchestra isn't exactly a break through in music, Metallica doing it is.  The band has long been known as possibly the best Hard Rock/Metal band ever (not to take anything away from Led Zepplin or Black Sabbath) and this adds a totally new dimension to their music.  From old classics like For Whom The Bell Tolls and One, to new hits like Hero of the Day and Outlaw Torn, this CD moves, mesmorizes and gives goosebumps to me every time.<br />Even though I would have liked to see Sanitarium or Fade to Black in place of songs like Devil's Dance, this CD is well worth the 20 bucks for both CDs.  And if you have a DVD player, get the live concert.  Just as worth it
0783228317|5.0|Funny stuff, Johnny Depp has a grea part in the movie and its starts of perfectly with, Bats. Del Toro plays also a good part as Depps attorny with great outcomes.  It is a must see hit that deals with the drug century.  This is the best movie on the drug decade!!!

B00002E23E|5.0|This DVD showcases Led Zeppelin in their glory years in the early to mid seventies.  It has some truely awesome footage from their 1973 Madison Square Garden appearance in which they played some of their greastest hits like heartbreaker, stairway to heaven, and black dog.  This is a must have for any hardcore led zeppelin fan. I found myself watching some of these live scenes time after time, its a great DVD not to be passed up!
B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica did an awesome job covering every one of these songs.  The CD with all the old cover songs released on B-sides is something I've wanted forever, and gives the album that old-Tallica charm.  While the CD with the new covers combines heavy guitar work with classics by Black Sabbath and Lynyrd Skynyrd, it shows what Metallica intends to accomplish with their music in the future... hard rock.  Some good ones on this are Turn the Page, Whiskey in the Jar (an old Irish folk song), and Tuesday's Gone.<br />Metallica shows where it got it's roots, and for that it gets a 5.
1882723007|5.0|Betty Eadie's book &quot;Embraced by the Light&quot; is an awesome book that I recommend everyone read.  I was recommended this book after the sudden passing of my 21yr old brother.  I can say that this book has truly helped me with my faith in the afterlife.  Betty's detail and descriptions of heaven are beautiful, belieavable, and utterly amazing.  It only took me a day or two to read it and after I was finished I longed to no more about near death experiences.  I have also read the Ripple Effect which was just as good as &quot;Embraced&quot;  However, Embraced was such a moving and touching  book, I would suggest that everyone start there.  It will truly make you think and believe in a life after this one and a comfort in knowing that your loved ones are safe in heaven.

068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is the chronicle of author Frank McCourt's childhood, first in America, then in Ireland, or purports to be. The sadness, tragedy, ugliness, and despair are laid on so thickly as to become improbable in combination. Bad things do happen to good people, but in McCourt's world, the worst always happens. When the family moves, it is to the worst house on the lane, next to the only outhouse. When it rains, their house is the one that floods. When he develops conjunctivitis, it is permanent (he still has it years later). When other kids' alcoholic fathers go to England during the war to earn money, his is the only one who drinks his pay away and loses the job. Nothing is ever halfway for McCourt. If there is a tragedy to tell, it will be the most tragic conceivable.<br />There are inconsistencies, such as time frames that make no sense, as well as improbabilities, like his grandmother making several walking round trips of over a mile, all in one night, months before her death. There is also the issue of whether McCourt could possibly recall such detail (as his lengthy story about the IRA refusing to helping his father out and why) during his very early years without any context. It would be as though you were four years old and heard your father talking about the New Deal, and you remembered everything about it even though you had no idea at the time what all the acronyms represented. Oddly, while McCourt goes into great detail about his early childhood, his timeline becomes increasingly compressed as he approaches adolescence. There is much less detail, and whole months are passed by just at a time when a person would be more likely to remember more -- and to be experiencing more. It almost feels like he grew tired of the tale (and fabricating it) and was in a rush to get to the end. Or perhaps, having gone through a sleazy conception, rats, fleas, sewage, open sores, tuberculosis, vomited blood, corporeal punishment,<br />prolonged hunger, his mother's prostitution, etc., etc., etc. (no horror goes untouched), he simply ran out of material.<br />So, from early on, I viewed Angela's Ashes as a work of fiction in which none of the characters is likeable. While many would say the father is the worst, as he is a hard-core alcoholic who cannot and will not support his family, I found him to be far more sympathetic a person than his mother as portrayed. When sober, the father often shows his sons small signs of affection and empathy, but Angela herself is nearly always cold, distant, and unsympathetic toward her children. She is always more focused on herself than on them. I'm not sure how many people could write about their own mothers as dispassionately as McCourt does. If she had one good quality, McCourt is careful not to present it.<br />As a child, McCourt seems relatively balanced, likeable, and ethical, wanting to do the right thing, but adolescence seems to turn him into a different person. He lies, he steals, he takes advantage of people -- and the only guilt he seems to feel is that imposed by the Catholic Church. There is never a sense, even when he achieves adulthood, that he has any deep thoughts about who he is, what he is doing, and how he affects others. Even his agonizing over his belief that he is responsible for a consumptive girl's descent into Hell because he had sex with her is tainted by the selfishness of his focus.<br />In the end, I must concur with an author acquaintance who said, &quot;Angela's Ashes? 'tis as phony as the photo on the cover.&quot;<br />But it is certainly well written and compelling, if you happen to have a large grain of salt handy. Recommended under those conditions.ostitution, etc., etc., etc. (no horror goes untouched), he simply ran out of material.<br />So, from early on, I viewed Angela's Ashes as a work of fiction in which none of the characters is likeable.

0525945636|4.0|Good standard thriller, though Follet's done better. Nor as good as better thrillers in recent years (Michael Crichton's AIRFRAME, Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE). But a good piece of work by a master of the genre.
B00000JG41|5.0|It's hard to give your personal title of 'best album ever made', but California would certainly be up there. I'd be here forever explaining why, but I'd agree with most things mentioned in the other reviews. Ars Moriendi is one of the greatest songs ever written, for me it's the Bohemian Raphsody of Bungle. As a musician I just get bored of your average 4/4 safe rock song, and when I first got into Bungle via Faith No More, they just blew everything into preportion musically. And their depth is endless. This album is just almost 'perfect' - whatever that may be. Buy it - You need this album like you need your brain!
B00004RFCM|3.0|I really liked this DVD. It was good to see how Mr. Big first met Carrey and view all the episodes that I missed. It also has a nice text screen that allows you to read about the episode before watching, that way you can tell which episode your going to see. However, I must say that the video quality of some of the episodes (especially the first one) is very grainy and basically sucks. The colors are bland and I was very disappointed. That being said, I still think this DVD is a must have...Just dont expect much in the &quot;video-quality&quot; department.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I originally saw this great  film in 1962 on the first release.  I've seen it two more times on the big screen, once around 1972 and again around 1993 at the AFI theatre in DC after the restoration of 1988-89.  Cut to the chase, I just watched the DVD, component out into a 36&quot; monitor and it looks  and sounds great.  I thought the 5.1 Dolby Surround was very nicely mixed.  The image was very crisp, very solid and stable colors and for once the sand was back to the natural salmon color of the original film. I hope there's a DTS mix someday. Anyway, it's great film.  It's great to be able to &quot;see&quot; it again on DVD. I highly recommend it.
B000056K04|5.0|I've been following DMB's carreer since 1994 and had not heard such a good album by them in quite a while.<br /> Never mind the popular 'I did it'. It doesn't speak well enough about the album.<br /> Pieces like 'The Space Between' and 'Mother Father' (with the participation of Carlos Santana), show you that these guys have come back with a very high caliber album that brings back some of their early feel, along with some ground breaking work.<br /> I recommend it highly.
B000005Z0G|5.0|A lot of people say All Eyez On Me is 2pac's best album, but I 100% disagree with that. In my opinion Yall say All Eyez On Me is his best album because you never have heard this 2pac or you didnt listen to rap in the early 90's.  2pac just goes so deep in this album its like all of his albums in this one Cd. Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. is a very off balance CD, 2pac talks about how wrong men are about women, but then he talks about Phukking them, but its not the lyrics that are off balance 2pac couldnt have wrote better lyrics for this CD, Its the beats. This CD is 2PACALYPSE NOW and THUG LIFE VOL.1 combined into one. Plus there are some very hard songs on here like the Thrid hit off the CD &quot;Holla If Ya Hear Me,&quot; this is one of the hardest songs ever made in rap history. In &quot;Holla If Ya Hear Me,&quot; 2pac is one angry Muthaphukkah, he screams in that song. Then theres the sad &quot;Papa'z Song,&quot; where 2pac is Angry, ...and upset about not having a father his whole life, its the 4th hit off the CD and PAC's basically saying POP's Step Tha Phukk Off. Then theres &quot;Last Wordz,&quot; Feat. Ice-T and Ice Cube and this might be a Faster and Harder song then &quot;Holla If Ya Hear Me&quot;. &quot;5 Deadly Venomz,&quot; is a good song with a lot of bass. The song where 2pac gets really deep is in &quot;keep ya head up,&quot; it was the 1st hit off the CD and PAC talks about how we should treat or women better and he samples &quot;Ooh Child,&quot; from Fivestair Steps. My favorite song off this CD is &quot;I Get Around,&quot; with Digital Underground , it was the 2nd hit off the CD and its one of 2pac's best songs ever. There isnt a bad song Off this CD thers &quot;Strugglin,&quot; &quot;Peep Game,&quot; and A lot of other tracks. If you havent heard this Pac you have to hear it.
B000003TAB|4.0|Incesticide was released to capitalize on the mammoth success of Nevermind.  The album collects early singles, b-sides and outtakes.  The album was most people's introduction to the fact that the band had released music prior to Nevermind.  The album's first two songs, &quot;Dive&quot; &amp; &quot;Sliver&quot;, made up the band's first single.  They are both short, but extremely powerful.  The album contains some incredible work in addition to &quot;Dive&quot; and &quot;sliver&quot;, most notably &quot;Aneurysm&quot;.  The song is a furious workout with squealing guitars , feedback, power drumming and amid all the noise, an incredible catchy melody.  Other strong cuts include &quot;Molly's Lips&quot;, &quot;Beeswax&quot;, &quot;Stain&quot; &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot; and &quot;Been A Son&quot;.  There are some forgettable numbers like &quot;Mexican Seafood&quot; and &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot;, but overall, Incesticide is better than your average compilation.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Whether you have all or most of his albums or want to take a peek into this brilliant artist's discography, this is an excellent pick.<br /> For those who have most (or even all) of his albums, it's an excellent compilation, and happens to also include the awesome new piece 'Again'.<br /> For those who are new to his music, Kravitz is the perfect combination of John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, but with a 90's feel to him. There is not one song or album he has released which is not simply excellent.
B000002BFZ|2.0|After the monster success of their first three albums, Pearl Jam did the time honored tradition of recording a self indulgent, non-commercial album that's more for themselves than their audience.  The band is to be applauded for branching out and stretching themselves, but as with most bands, they would have been better off sticking to what they do best.  The band is influenced by Neil Young, especially his work with Crazy Horse.  The band tries to ape the sound of Mr. Young's work from Rust Never Sleeps on &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; but they come across as bad imitations.  They go curiously into a world beat sound on the &quot;Who You Are&quot; (flip flopping the title of another major influence, The Who's &quot;Who Are You&quot;) and &quot;In My Tree&quot;.  The latter song is particular bad.  Stone Gossard steps in front of the microphone to sing &quot;Mankind&quot; and he shows why he is the band's lead guitarist.  The album is not without its merits. &quot;Hail Hail&quot; ranks as one the band's all-time best songs with its driving guitars and powerful Eddie Vedder vocals and &quot;Lukin&quot; is another strong rocker.  Many people love this album for its eclectic nature and the fact that it doesn't sound like anything else the band has ever done.  That's the problem No Code suffers from, it doesn't sound like a Pearl Jam record.
B000002UDD|3.0|Actually, I give this record 3 1/2 stars. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that King Diamond is one of my all time favorites. I consider Exodus a little behind King Diamond. I think Metallica is overrated, but I don't deny that their 'Ride the Lightning' is an intense masterpiece. As far as Megadeth is concerned, I consider the 3 essential or 'gotta have' Megadeth records to be \\"Peace Sells, But Who's Buying,\\" \\"Rust In Peace,\\" and \\"The World Needs A Hero.\\" Like \\"Hidden Treasures,\\" I consider \\"So far So Good So What\\" to be a strong 2nd best. (And 2nd best isn't always so bad!) Well, moving on, 'Into the Lungs of Hell' is a nice instramental introduction that lures us in. 'Set the World Afire' is a nice powerful thrashy song that sets the mood. 'Anarchy In the UK' is a nice follow up. I haven't heard the original, so I can't compare. 'Mary Jane' is a nice song with strong intensity, frustration, and sorrow side by side. '502,' well, it's a great song, but don't get any ideas if you're playing this tape while you're driving! 'In my Darkest Hour' shows a gentler and sadder side of Megadeth. 'Liar' is probably the main reason for the warning sticker on the record. It's a good song full of obscenities. (I'm digressing a little, but Dave Mustaine had had a falling out with his former guitarist. He had stolen equipment and claimed it was a break in. So it would explain why Dave Mustaine sounds like he's venting.) 'Hook In Mouth' may actually be the best song on this record. Not only is it nice and powerful, but it shows the hypocrisy of politicians and those in authority. It also shows how the truth is often lost by people who write history. I guess my advice boils down to this. This record is certainly worth having. but if your budget is a little on the tighter side, first buy \\"Peace Sells, But Who's Buying,\\" \\"Rust In Peace,\\" and \\"The World Needs A Hero.\\"
B000002AZ8|5.0|The name and look of Pearl Jam's third album Vitalogy was taken from an old medical journal about medicine and a philosophy of life.  The cd is not in the regular jewel casing, but is set up to look like a mini medical journal.  The album's songs deal with life and death and ways to heal your soul.  &quot;Last Exit&quot; questions what awaits in the afterlife.  &quot;Spin The Black Circle&quot; is a punk like ode to the healing power of good old vinyl.  &quot;Whipping&quot; returns to subject close to Eddie Vedder's heart the abortion rights argument.  &quot;Immortality&quot; is a song that questions life and death and was obviously inspired by the suicide of Kurt Cobain.  &quot;Tremor Christ&quot; is a great track with an interesting arrangement while &quot;Corduroy&quot; is a straight-ahead rocker in the classic Pearl Jam tradition.  They quiet things down on &quot;Nothing Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Better Man&quot; and &quot;Not For You&quot; is probably the best song on the album with it's slow, driving and powerful beat.  There are some truly bizarre songs on the album like &quot;Bugs&quot; &amp; &quot;Aye Davanita&quot;, but &quot;Stupid Mop&quot; takes the cake as the hands down weirdest song the band's every done.  These three songs are a complete waste (to add insult to injury &quot;Stupid Mop&quot; drags on for seven plus minutes), but they cannot diminish or take away from the rest of the album which is a powerful and intense statement.

B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. was Pearl Jam's follow-up to their megaselling debut Ten.  The album shows a nice progression of the music.  Where Ten was full of anthems and power chords, Vs. expands their sound to include more acoustic guitars and they show a softer side.  Most notably is the long windedly titled &quot;Elderly Woman Behind A Counter In A Small Town&quot;.  The song is built around a soft melody and has a subtle vocal performance from Eddie Vedder. &quot;Daughter&quot; is another softer song but it has the social consciousness of &quot;Jeremy&quot;. The song is about child abuse and the band employs strings to give it a stirring edge.  The band still punches out some crunching guitars on the album.  &quot;rearviewmirror&quot; is a pulsating track, &quot;Go&quot; is a short blast of punkish fury and &quot;Blood&quot; has a funky riff to it.  &quot;Leash&quot; has the anthem like quality of &quot;Alive&quot; and Mr. Vedder sings it with the right amount of anger.  Vs. is just a notch below Ten, but it is still a tremendous album and an impressive piece of work from Eddie Vedder and the crew.

B0000035E7|4.0|Bleach was the debut record of the most influential band of the last twenty years, Nirvana.  Released on the seminal Seattle label, Sub Pop, the album is an impressive work.  Kurt Cobain was a troubled young man and his conflicts, fears and angst drove his music. Bleach has a much heavy grunge sound to it than their subsequent releases, but it still has the crisp melodies that separated the band from the rest of the grunge artists.  Songs like &quot;About A Girl&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot; and &quot;Blew&quot; have almost pop sensibilities but unlike most happy, sunny pop songs, the lyrics about hurt, obsession, betrayal.  Most of the songs are powerful barrages of machine gun guitars and stinging feedback.  The band was still evolving at this point as Dave Grohl had not yet joined and they had an extra guitarist.  The playing isn't as crisp and powerful as it would become, but the album showed that Mr. Cobain was a force to be reckoned with.

It's an obsession that is not merely surface &quot;good movie,&quot; but explores every facet of the world that is created and photographed.  A true Fantasy Film Fan knows the background of the characters, their names, their passions, their motivations.  And then the Fan separates Fiction from Fact by knowing how things were done (special effects, writing, etc.) and marveling at the making of the film.  A good DVD presentation of a fantasy film is a dream come true for Fantasy Film Fans.  Unfortunately, a good DVD created for the fan can be hard to find.  Fortunately, if you're a &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; Fan, you've been blessed with a spectacular DVD.<br />1. 2.35:1 Widescreen Presentation- A simply perfect print in it's original widescreen format is enough to make any Dark Crystal Fan faint.<br />2. Making of Documentary- This is a great documentary on the Making of &quot;The Dark Crystal.&quot;  The comments by Jim Henson and Frank Oz to say a few reflects the abitious nature of the making of this film.  Not only is there a lot of delicious information but the passion of film making can truly be seen in this documentary.<br />3. Isolated Music Score- A great fantasy film is not just wonderful visuals, but also grand music.  Trevor Jones composed a beautiful score that adds audio color to &quot;The Dark Crystal.&quot;  You can fully appreciate his work by isolating the score and just watching the music and how it was married beautifully to the visuals.<br />4. Deleted Scenes- The deleted funeral scenes and original language work prints are incredible and fascinating to see.<br />Although these 4 features alone are well worth the cost of this DVD, the film itself is a gem.  A rare opportunity to see what happens when a fantasy film is done the right way.  Fantasy Films are not just about magic and quests.  A good Fantasy Film takes you to an entirely new world and creates every facet of life there making it so real that obsessed fans must own DVDs that explore deep into its creation.  If you're a &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; Fan, or someone looking for a good fantasy film, you must own this DVD.
B000003TAR|5.0|After the huge success of Nevermind, Nirvana became reluctant superstars and the poster boys for the new Alternative music scene.  Kurt Cobain was not comfortable with all the adulation and hero worship throw at him and many of the songs on their follow-up to Nevermind, In Utero, deal with the high price of fame.  &quot;Serve The Servants&quot;, &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;Milk It&quot; deal with the trappings of superstardom.  &quot;Frances Farmer Will Get Her Revenge On Seattle&quot; is a powerful song about the former actress who went crazy from the pressures of Hollywood.  Not everything is about rock stardom though.  &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; is about his relationship with Courtney Love and it is one of the most stingingly powerful songs the band ever recorded.  &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; is a soft and almost touching song that stands out next to a song of unbridled fury like &quot;Tourette's&quot;.  &quot;Rape Me&quot; opens up quietly with the guitar riff from &quot;Smell Like Teen Spirit&quot; before diving into a furious crashing of guitars.  The song alternates between quiet strumming and singing to frenzied, crashing guitars and blood curdling screams.  In its short playing time, it perfectly encapsules both sides of Nirvana's music.  The album closes out with the quiet power of &quot;All Apologies&quot; that is a perfect ending to the album and as it turned out their recording career.  Nirvana wanted to get back to a harder edge and In Utero is much heavier than Nevermind.  Unfortunately it would mark the last album of original music the band would make.
B000002P5R|5.0|a few years ago, i had only just heard of jimi hendrix, and on a very spontaneous decision i bought this album, little did i know it would change the way i look at music almost more than any other album i would ever hear. no, its not as astonishing or as revolutionary as &quot;are you experienced&quot;, no its not as beatiful as &quot;axis: bold as love&quot; and no, its not a masterpiece like &quot;electric ladyland&quot;, but this album, i think, has an element that appears more here than on any other album; it was jimi doing what he WANTED to do and not what he was  EXPECTED to do. the recordings may not be the his best or most polished, but there is not a more honest album that i had ever heard before listening to it or ever since. just one listen to &quot;my friends&quot;(which is my personal favorite hendrix track)  or &quot;hey baby(new rising sun)&quot;, and you can catch, for one fleeting moment, what Hendrix could have done had he lived. This was my first Hendrix album, and is still one of my favorite albums by anyone today. do yourself a favor, expecially if you are a hendrix fan and get it. if your not a hendrix fan... well... i wasnt when i got it, and now he is my favorite musician of all time - bar none. a truly amazing album.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I'd actually like to give this one 3 and 1/2, but halves aren't an option.  :-P<br />All critques of sound quality aside, this record is still just okay.  I don't regret buying it, but it's far from being my favorite Beatles record.  It should be obvious that a record of a band's number one hits is different than a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, especially when you consider that some of the Beatles' very best tunes are from records that never spawned singles (Sgt. Pepper's, the White Album), thus making those tracks ineligible for this CD right from the start.<br />There's nothing wrong with these songs though.  They're all worthy tunes, and it's amazing to watch the band's music grow in sophistication over the course of a single disc.  <br />Unlike some reviewers, I believe that this is a worthwhile first disc for beginners.  Perhaps the Anthology series is a better overview, but it may be too pricey for somone just starting out.  Since this is a band that changed so drastically over the course of less than a decade (!), it's impossible to suggest one specific studio album to start with.  This is the only single disc collection that provides a good overview of the Beatles' legacy for a novice.  For the rest of us, it's certainly not essential, but I'm glad I picked it up.
B000005DQR|5.0|85 reviews for this CD! I am glad that people are listening to and hopefully supporting artists like this. My 2 cents: This CD is simply wonderful. It is a joy to the ears and soul.
0440539811|4.0|i started writting a book about a chaos mage phreaker with brain damage, and a drug problem inadvertantly pissing of an illuminati agent, and ending up saving the world from certain certainty. it was to be a mixture of naked lunch, the matrix, and hp love craft. these bastards beat me to it. the annoying thing was i had already written most of &quot;candle throat&quot; (as it was to be called) when someone gave me a copy of illuminatus. it was annoyingly good and better than mine. but mine didn't have talking dolphins in it. brilliant, funny, clever, acurate etc. one question though, where are the other two?
0451160916|4.0|First, let me start by saying The Shining is a fantastic read.  You will be emotionally stimulated by this suspenseful portrayal of the Torrance family and their battle for survival.  <br />This novel explores the concept of history as a cyclical force; king is asserting that people have the ability to manipulate history and to forget or &quot;overlook&quot; its cyclical presence.  The Shining documents the struggle that results from individuals that perform both of these actions.  Stephen King uses the conventions of a ghost story to dramatize his themes.  The forgotten past that is haunting the family in the present is represented by the Overlook Hotel itself.  The Hotel personifies the cyclical force that is threatening to first, isolate the family from the rest of the world and eventually from each other, and to then completely destroy the family unit.  The focus of the Hotel's motivation lies in Danny, the young boy (only child of Jack and Wendy) who possesses a gift - the shining - that allows him to see things both in the past and the future.  The Hotel, the aggressor in the conflict, desires this gift in order to ensure everlasting life; to ensure its history will live forever. (Of course the Hotel itself is &quot;overlooking&quot; that it is the nature of history that makes it live on forever - its cyclical nature). The ensuing rising action details the Torrance family's struggle to overcome the Hotel's opposition on a dramatic level and to overcome their desire to ignore their history repeating itself in the present on a thematic level.  <br />Unfortunately,the dramatic reading is stressed in the marketing of this novel and, as a result, is usually the only level perceived by its readers.  This misconception is not helped by Stanley Kubrick's film that is an inaccurate adaptation of the novel.  Kubrick's film, though creatively successful, fails to portray King's thematic intentions; Stephen King only used the ghost story conventions on which the film is based as a toll to dramatize his themes.  These conventions drive the reader through the novel by constantly building suspense.  Therefore, placing this novel strictly in a genre category would be a slight to King's intentions and a disgraceful attempt at critical reading. A careful reader will identify both the dramatic and thematic lines of narrative in this literary work.<br />For those who have difficulty reading The Shining thematically, look closely at structure.  This novel is divided into a 5-act structure.  However, King does not strictly follow the conventions of this structure.  The first two acts are devoted to exposition; the third act contains more exposition, the inciting incident and the start of the rising action; the fourth act continues the suspenseful rising action; the fifth act concludes the rising action witht the crisis moment, the falling action and the resolution. <br /> Critically reading this novel entails picking up all of the evidence King carefully provides and correctly identifying the inciting incident and the main conflict, dramatically and thematically.  The novel is saturated with the theme of cyclical history.  In fact, even before the novel begins, King informs us of this theme and its consequences with the excerpt from Edgar Allen Poe's The Masque of the Red Death.  He continues with countless passages about the Torrance family history, the Overlook Hotel's history, American history (the prejudice and racism involving women, homosexuals and blacks), and the history of the various relationships in the novel.  <br />king brilliantly demonstrates how easily history is manipulated via its varying descriptions by different voices in the novel.  For example, the Overlook Hotel's history is shown in many different lights, including both Ullman's praising, biased view and the scrapbook's negatively revealing view.  Also, the concept of the memory of history, individual's own recollections of history, being unreliable is found throughoutthe novel.  <br />Thus, through careful consideration, is should be impossible to critically collect this evidence and not come up with the ambitious thematic reading King is asserting in The Shining.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I wasn't really a Green Day fan until about 1999(long after Nimrod came out), when I met a friend that let me listen to his CDs and I became one of the biggest fans ever. In the past couple years I have managed to acquire all the studio CDs except Kerplunk, Which I am working on geting. I bought warning on Oct. 3rd (opening day) on my lunch break.  It was a surprise to say the least, but once I got used to the sound, I really enjoyed it. It's no Nimrod, but it is better than Insomniac. If you liked time of your life, you'll probably like it, and &quot;Fashion victim&quot; is essential listening for anyone who knows a kid headed for junior high.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nevermind was nothing compare to In Utero. ...In utero is just the best Rock album since 70's and it s not limp or other bands in 2001 who can pretend be as good as Nirvana - In Utero. A real band, a real suffering, a real personn, a real soul. A man, not a marketing product. Stay real.
0140185232|4.0|Let me start by saying that this book is indeed great. The style of writing by Maugham is incredible. The book is basically the life of Larry as described through the eyes of the author. Larry searches for the meaning of life and supposedly finds it in an Ashram from South India.<br />  The whole discussion between Maugham and Larry towards the end of the book is fascinating. Since I am from South India I exactly understand what they were saying. The only problem I had with the book was the abrupt transformation that Larry goes through on the top of the mountain. This leaves a taste of an unfinished work and the satisfaction of an answer is never gained at the end. On the whole an excellent read.....
B000006ZPY|3.0|This album Really was a bad way to keep fans. It in all fairness was the producer or mixers fault. I do think that some songs on here really are good but do to the boring 80's sound on here you really miss the stringth this album has. 1. Gates Of Hell -Only an intro to Headless Cross the Song. 70% . .2. Headless Cross - Well this is the highlight of the album. Very well done. 95% 3. Devil &amp; Daughter - Good song. sort of classy. 90%4. When Death Calls - Heavyer song? Something I wish Tony Martin would do more of! 95% . .5. Kill In The Spirit- Weird song. Something that sounds too 80's but will atleast keep this album interestig. 90% . .6. Call Of The Wild - This song plain lost me. This song should have been the beside! 80% . .7. Black Moon - This song is very Classical in ways. This is probably give you a good idea of where Black Sabbath went with TYR. 95%  . . 8. Nightwing - Not sure whypeople think this song is so great. It sounds too muc like another 80's song. But it's ok. 90% . .( Japan Extra track and on Black Moon cd Single 9. Cloak &amp; Dagger- This song is better than almost everything on the album. I was very pleased I spent my $14 on the Black Moon cd Single (It's somewhat hard to find) But this song is a faster pace song. I sort of understand why it was left out tho. some lines in this song were used in other songs on the album. 95% )If you like this album you should Check out: Black Sabbath- Heaven and Hell, Black Sabbath- TYR, Black Sabbath- Cross Purposes, Black Sabbath- Enternal Idol, Black Sabbath- Seventh Star.
B0000508U6|2.0|I wanted to like this CD, as they seem to be the at the forefront of Alternative Rock these days; so I picked up the CD...listened...waited for something exciting to make me go &quot;WOW!&quot;...listed...waited some more...listened....  I made it to the end of the CD...but really no &quot;WOW&quot;.  This is passable music...perhaps best left to the elevator.<br />If you want Alternative Rock to make you go &quot;WOW!&quot;, skip Coldplay, then get &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; by SPOON.  Each song is melodic, good basic guitar &amp; drums, and unique unto the other songs.

B00003CXRP|5.0|I truly do not like Tom Hanks, and I usually avoid his movies... but when I saw this movie in the Cinema I really must admit it is an excellent movie.<br />90% of the time, Tom Hanks is alone in the movie... and for an actor to do such a job is something. He managed to make us laugh loud, sympathize and enjoy the movie.<br />But I think he should have lost much more waight... he was not thin enough!<br />For both Tom Hanks fans and non-fans... this movie is worth watching!
B00003CXBK|5.0|The genius behing Pincess Mononoke, combines the legends and myths of the forest and brings it to the reality.  Fill with emotion and sphistication, the art is extremely incridible.  I couldn't believe it was all that when I bought it. I would recomend this movie to anyone out there who likes myths and tales of the forest and also for those who never heard of some of the tales of the forest.  This movie would bring u a little closer to what you been missing out.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|This is not a movie... it is as well said a &quot;Screen Saver&quot;!<br />It is so relaxing, entertaining and amazing! It shows you the paths of the world, sounds and scenes... how it all floats in a rythm.<br />It is worth watching and buying... I hope there are many DVD's of this type.
0064407667|5.0|The &quot;Series&quot; is a charming addition to the world of childrens books. Not only do these books give children the chance to learn new words in a fun way, they are also classic examples of storytelling. Kids will love to hate Uncle Olaf and enjoy the antics of three smart, respectful children.    Particuarly, I enjoy the fact that Violet is a 14 year old girl who is interested in engineering, while Klaus loves to read. The reversal of typical &quot;girls love books&quot; &quot;boys love science&quot; roles is valuable for kids to see.    Finally, I know that I've read them and come to parts where I have burst out laughing. The clever humor adds so much to the series
0671015206|2.0|If this book got summarized in a Newspaper article, it would have been acceptable.<br />But it was a long boring book, that I could not finish..! In summary this books talks about certain Millionaires (who are a majority by the way) who made their furtune by being cheap!

0792156684|4.0|Ok the movie is so great... to me the love story is a weak point in the movie, it doesn't sound reasonable or convincing to me (that's why I did not rate it five stars). But the scenes are so RICH, great picture, great acting, great animation, great emotions and great soundtrack!<br />But it really bothers me that this DVD has no extra's what so ever!!!! The TITANIC DVD should be so rich with extra's and the making of the movie features...<br />So four stars for the movie but no stars for this DVD edition!
B00003CXE7|4.0|Almost all my DVDs are region 1, I like them because they have more specials, better presentation, and even better quality (just compare Matrix Region 1 with Matrix region 4). But in this case, I have to say that region 4 rocks. The DVD presentation is the same, the extras are the same, and the quality is the same.... BUT.... you have spanish dialoge, portuguese dialoge spanish subtitles, thai subtitles, chinese subtitles, portuguese subtitles,and other subtitles I don't remember. Even the specials have subtitles in those languages. I think the reason for a DVD is the multiple languages option (besides the sound and picture quality), waste a DVD with only one language and NO subtitles can't be forgiven.<br /> Well, as the two DVDs are the same, I have to say the movie quality is great, good sound, good picture quality. I liked the costumes a lot (worth the Oscar).<br /> It has a lot of extras, all very interesting.<br /> If you live in USA, don't hessitate buying this DVD, anyway you speak english, but if you don't, buy the DVD from your region, has all the same extras the zone 1 DVD has.
6305127689|4.0|Ok the movie is so great... I liked the story that includes friendship, love and challange... the soundtrack is great as well. But what really bothers me is that this DVD has no extra's what so ever!!!!<br />If you love this movie, you better wait for another DVD edition to enjoy the extra's!
B000002IGP|4.0|I was first introduced to Ratt on Friday Night Videos in 1984 when they first showed the video for &quot;Round and Round.&quot;  (You know, that really cool video with Milton Berle!)  I liked the song immediately, and it didn't take more than the next 3 times I heard it to make me badly want to get the album &quot;Out Of The Cellar.&quot;  Just before I did, I had already heard the follow-up single &quot;Back For More.&quot;  ANOTHER killer track!!  I bought the album, and it remained one of my most-played albums that year.  The above two songs were my favorite, plus I also liked &quot;You're In Trouble&quot; and &quot;Wanted Man&quot;.  Sorry, but &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; never did it for me,  I basically refer to it as &quot;Lackluster Communication.&quot;<br />Ratt was a group that had a glam image, but were certainly not a bubblegum group by any means.  They had a good, crunchy sound; more melodic than the Crue and no less talented.  Ratt was also never one to ride on anybody's coattails.  I've always found it interesting that as soon as they became big, they distanced themselves from other L.A.-based heavy metal bands. (You would have expected a young band like them to do the opposite.)  First of all, they described themselves as hard rock, and they went out of their way to distance themselves from the &quot;heavy metal&quot; category.  In fact, lead singer Stephen Pearcy STILL maintains that Ratt was not really a heavy metal band at all, just a regular hard rock band.  Whether or not this would accurately describe their style of music I guess is a matter of personal taste, and is therefore subjective.  In any case, I have always respected them for being very non-pretensious about themselves.  Listen to their music and decide for yourself what they are. :)<br />I do agree very much with the earlier reviewer, who said that the real secret of this band was the rhythmic groove they provided, in the form of bassist Juan Croucier and drummer Bobby Blotzer (who was such a madman on drums, and probably one of the strongest drummers of his time).  Of course, this is to take nothing away from Warren DeMartini's talent on lead guitar:  I've always admired his fluid, effortless style of playing.  Robin Crosby played a steady rhythm guitar, and occasionally traded off some pretty mean leads with Warren DeMartini (like on &quot;Round and Round&quot;).  Stephen Pearcy has always been a decent rock 'n' roll singer/screamer.  Sure, he'll never be counted among the true greats (Plant, Halford, Dickinson), but how many hard rock singers can say that they've been doing this for 20 years the way Pearcy has?<br />After this album, Ratt would go on to record several others, each of them having at least 2 or 3 certifiable rock 'n' roll hits.  Over time, they have amassed a pretty impressive collection of great songs...call them hard rock or heavy metal, one thing's for sure:  Ratt have been, for the past 20 years, one of the most consistently good rock 'n' roll bands around.  They are instantly recognizable without being repetitious.  Ratt rocks!! :)
B00003OSSL|1.0|I can never believe such a successful actor could fail this way!<br />This movie could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the Cinema history... it has a meaningless story, bad acting, and is so stupid!<br />If you want to say a star fall so bad, watch this movie... but do not ever consider buying it, or you'll be sorry!
B000002INR|4.0|&quot;...lived 9-to-5 and worked his FINGERS TO THE BO-O-ONE!!!!&quot;<br />That, right there, in the opening line from the great and disturbing song &quot;18 and Life,&quot; sums up Skid Row perfectly:  They could start out a song nice &amp; slow, almost innocent, and then in a matter of a split second, whip it into a frenzy of magnificent bombastic heavy metal proportions.  Plus, all the themes of youth gone wild are here, with all of the pain, heartache, and yes, even tragedy of growing up.  Here's a band who looked good, played hard, and were not afraid to reflect the honest truth of the horrors of growing up as inner-city youth.  They were also immensely talented, almost frightening in their power and virtuosity.<br />Of course, most standout is Sebastian Bach's incredible vocal range and larger-than-life persona.  His multi-octave vocal screech isn't so much screaming as it is full-throttle singing on all cylinders.  However, that isn't what is most appealing about his vocal talents.  Many heavy metal singers have high-pitched screechy voices, but Sebastian infuses his high-octane vocals with a tremendous amount of emotion.  I think that is what really makes him one of the greatest rock 'n' roll singers of all time.<br />This is a great album.  From the famous anthem &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot; to the most powerful power ballads &quot;18 and Life&quot; and &quot;I Remember You&quot; to the near-thrash &quot;Piece of Me,&quot; Skid Row were a band that combined raw talent, heart, soul...and especially ..., like hardly other band did at the time.  I remember Skid Row, fondly. :)
6305903182|2.0|I am a big fan of SCREAM 1 &amp; 2... and I was really hoping that Wes Craven might be able to succeed in this TRIOLOGY but as all triologies fall down... Scream 3 was as bad if not worse!<br />The scenes of 3 are much weaker than of 1 &amp; 2... the thrill, suspense and surprises are very low!<br />If you are buying the Boxed set or building Scream library go ahead and buy it... if not don't consider it as it is very disappointing, at least in comparison to the 1 &amp; 2 it failed!

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I don't know how powerful the music will be if you have never seen the film, but if you have, the album is almost like reliving the film.  The string music is grating, mesmerizing, soothing, and shocking all at once.
B000002UWP|5.0|I first heard this album in 1991 while my family was vacationing in Italy, near Piza. My cousin let me borrow it for an afternoon.  I've been hooked ever since and have great memories of it.  This album is &quot;Per&quot;-fect happy music. (Pun intended, the lead guitarist/singer is Per Gessle.)  This album is the only CD my siblings and I listen to while playing Super Mario 3 on the original Nintendo, when we get a chance.  <br />Roxette will always have a special place in my musical heart...
B000050FEN|5.0|Sure, we have all seen serial killer movies, but rarely are they so masterfully done.  David Fincher has constructed a multi-layered work of sublime precision.  The photography of Darius Khondji (Pulp Fiction, The Ninth Gate) is as perfect as you can get.  Morgan Freeman is his usual outstanding self but Brad Pitt gives a highly nuanced performance that just provides more evidence that he is another &quot;star&quot; who never gets enough credit for his acting.  The bonus material, like the &quot;Fight Club&quot; DVD, is outstanding also.
B000059LGC|5.0|The video tape of &lt;Death on the Nile&gt; has long been available, although the widescreen edition was hard to find except on such channels as AMC and TCM. Now I am delighted to find that star-studded film on DVD with the Anchor Bay label.  As has been pointed out by many, this plot fits the Agatha Christie pattern in which an isolated group of people (on an island, a train, a boat) experience murder and the guilty party must be one of themselves. In one of them, they ALL did it. In two of them, the detective did it. In one of them the only two who could not have possibly done it did it. In the slim case you do not know the solution to &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; I will say no more.<br />  As with &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; the period d&eacute;cor is just about perfect and each one of the Big Names in the cast gets at least two good scenes in which to do their thing. Possibly Maggie Smith can be singled out as giving us the most subtly comical character in many a film. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, pulls out all the stops as the forever tipsy author of sex novels. And indeed the entire project has an obvious blend of comedy that helps make this (perhaps) a bit more watchable than was the far more serious &quot;Orient Express&quot; that had preceded it. (How seriously can you take a film in which the manager of the cruise ship exclaims &quot;Goody goody gumdrops&quot; when they dredge up the murder weapon?) (And how did the villain acquire a live cobra aboard the ship?)<br />  There is no point in comparing Ustinov's Poirot with Finney's in the &quot;Orient Express&quot; film, since they both are very good in their own ways and neither had David Suchet with whom to contend. What is a good example of missed opportunity is one of the DVD's bonus features that gives us an interview in Spanish with Ustinov in which he is not really being asked the right questions to elicit any really interesting answers. A similar interview with Jane Birkin proves even less enlightening.<br />  Among the DVD extras is a not-bad 24 minute &quot;Making Of&quot; short, the original trailer, and some short but detailed printed bios of the cast, included Harry Andrews, who shows up for only a few moments at the film's start.<br />  All in all, this is a DVD I know I will view many times in the future, as I have done with the full screen tape edition, but with far greater satisfaction.<br />  As a footnote, I should mention that Audio Partners has released a reading of the complete novel with David Suchet as narrator and the entire cast. It always makes a fascinating game to see what changes the film has to make to simplify things.s even less enlightening.<br />   Among the DVD extras is a not-bad 24 minute &quot;Making Of&quot; short, the original trailer, and some short but detailed printed bios of the cast, included Harry Andrews, who shows up for only a few moments at the film's start.<br />     All in all, this is a DVD I know I will view many times in the future, as I have done with the full screen tape edition, but with far greater satisfaction.<br />   As a footnote, I should mention that Audio Partners has released a reading of the complete novel with David Suchet as narrator and the entire cast.

B00004YM0D|5.0|I saw the world premire of &quot;Remember The Titans&quot; at the Rose Bowl, and then saw it two more times in theaters, and loved every minuet of it.  It was a wonderful movie, and the soundtrack is fabulous!
0517122707|5.0|This is the funniest piece of work I've ever really enjoyed. How did some reviewers ever found this book 'boring'??? If you are offended by JK Toole's humour, or don't find it funny at all, you're BORING! to say the least.<br />Even those of you who have read any funny books in your lifetime, can you say honestly that this isn't the funniest you've read?
0553579908|4.0|Mr.Martin is a superb storyteller. He pays great attention to detail and references his past works diligently. My main problem is these books are so depressing. After 8000 years of this civilisations' existence,(8000 years of the Stark name being extant), the people in this story have barely gotten past inventing the wheel. Imagine being stuck in a cold murky castle, with a feudal system of crazed knights, lords and kings for eternity - this is the definition of a nightmare. Does the story line get less depressing with this book? Heck no, it's worse. Maybe after ten 1000 page books, these folks will discover the steam engine. I don't consider this series fantasy - it is pure horror. I will read the next installment in the series, if only to find out how much mileage martin can get out of this well thought out nightmare.
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance is a fabulous album that moves the heart and soul.  More upbeat and r&amp;b than his previous masterwork, &quot;Astral Weeks,&quot; &quot;Moondance&quot; is no less brilliant.  &quot;Moondance&quot; is one of those albums you just put in the car and let it play.  <br />The album starts out with the self reflective &quot;And It Stoned Me.&quot;  The imagery on this song alone proves that Van Morrison belongs with Lennon, McCartney and Dylan as one of rock's great lyricists.  The album then swings into the jazzy title track about love in the moment on the dance floor.  &quot;Caravan&quot; in my opinion is one of the greatest road songs ever recorded.  A song that combines the mysticism of a gypsy caravan and turning the radio takes us on a journey into what music is all about, emotion.   While all of the songs are amazing pieces of music, (notably &quot;Crazy Love,&quot; and &quot;Brand New Day&quot;) the real standout on this album is &quot;Into the Mystic.&quot;  &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; is a haunting love song about getting away from it all, and leaving the troubles of earth behind.  It is the song of a lost lover singing to his live companion that soon they will travel &quot;Into the Mystic.&quot;<br />This album is a must have for any true fan of music.  Great songwriting, musicianship, and feeling make this album a forever classic. A+
0156907399|5.0|Virginia Woolf's novel &quot;To The Lighthouse,&quot; is, as its title suggests, a multivoiced final journey from the 19th century into the 20th.  What must be determined over the course of reading the novel and reflecting on it, is the function of the lighthouse.  Are its probing, distant lights supposed to be a beacon of hope as its characters move from the repressive age of Victoria into the liberating age of technology?  Does the lighthouse echo the arch of experience which Tennyson's Ulysses claims 'fades forever and forever when I move' toward it?  Or is the lighthouse just a lighthouse?<br />Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's main character and guiding principle, is herself a lighthouse, built on a foundation of tradition and stock 19th century notions of how people should interact in society and towards each other.  Her matchmaking schemes are ever fainter echoes of the Victorian novel's marriage plots.  Woolf undermines and qualifies Mrs. Ramsay's intentions by exploding the conventions of the 19th century novel - plot structure becomes amorphous, protean formlessness; narrative voice is shared between characters as narration becomes thought and smoothly passes from character to character, anticipating the stream of consciousness style.  <br />Woolf also questions Mrs. Ramsay's social priorities - is marriage really a vital or necessary condition for women?  Through close examination of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's marriage, Lily Briscoe's determination to remain single, and the novel's myriad other relationships, Woolf severely problematizes any comfortable ideas about knowing other people.  Another important issue is the social value of art - Frequent conversations involving the philosopher Mr. Ramsay, the doctoral student Charles Tansley, the poet Augustus Carmichael, and the painter Lily Briscoe, along with Woolf's own speculations on the permanence of human design in Part II ask us to consider the role of art in regard to humanity.  <br />In a novel where the boundaries of time and space are consistently challenged, and the family unit is exposed, one must also focus on the erotics of storytelling.  Love, hatred, admiration, and disgust permeate &quot;To The Lighthouse.&quot;  Our attempt as readers to understand the drive of the novel compels us to seek a reason for reading it among these four potential narrative scenarios.  Does love, hate, or some combination of the two commit the characters to reveal their thoughts, and why do these thoughts involve us so that we feel a need to read to the end?<br />&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; is a fascinating book - coming on the heels of such anti-Victorian masterpieces as Edith Wharton's &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and Samuel Butler's &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot;  Woolf's novel through form and content seeks to put the 19th century to rest, while simultaneously dealing with the terrors of post-World War I existence.  Concentrate and give Woolf your undivided attention.  This novel deserves it.
B000002H8F|5.0|&quot;Bossanova&quot; is a tour de force masterpiece from one of rock's most revolutionary bands.  An album full of chaos, fun, surfing and otherworldly imagery, &quot;Bossanova&quot; takes the listener to worlds that exist only in Black Francis' twisted head.  From the opening chord on the surf instrumental &quot;Cecilia Ann&quot; to the beautiful conclusion &quot;Havelina,&quot; &quot;Bosanova is a perfect rock album.  &quot;Rock Music&quot; shows what rock really is, indecipherable nonsensical screaming.  &quot;My Velouria&quot; is a beautifully written song (it could be about the ecstasy of love, or the ecstasy of drugs, you decide).  &quot;Alision&quot; is power punk pop at it's finest.  &quot;And when the planet hit the sun, I saw the face of Alison&quot; capture the moment of love(or lust) at first sight.  &quot;Dig For Fire&quot; is another melodic sing-a-long pop song.  <br />My favorite 3 tracks on the album however, are &quot;The Happening,&quot; &quot;Blown Away,&quot; and &quot;All Over the World.&quot;  Listening to &quot;All Over the World&quot; takes you everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  It combines the trippy journeys to the moon and back etc., with an ending cadence of defiance against the rules and morals of modern society.  &quot;Blown Away&quot; shows how idiotic we all are when it comes down to women, &quot;I didn't get so far, my words got blown away.&quot;  <br />The climax of the album occurs on &quot;The Happening,&quot; a song about Las Vegas, aliens, and Shakespere (the last part of the song is written in Shakesperean sonnet form....cool!).  The screaming about aliens landing in Caesar's Palace is interrupted twice in the song by the beautiful melody of Francis' vocals and Santiago's guitar.  The last half of the song is nothing short of brilliant.  You'll have to listen for yourself to get the full effect.<br />The Pixies' &quot;Bossanova&quot; is one of my favorite albums.  It takes you all over the place with it's trippy songsabout love, rock, confusion, and aliens.  A bizarre album, yet beautiful at the same time.  One of the best albums of the 90's. A+
B00005AAFS|5.0|A friend of mine got me into Rammstein a while back.  Sensucht was a great album filled with Metallica-esque (we're talkin' earlier metallica here) power chords and growling, almost inhuman, vocals that made you want to snap your neck, banging your head.  Well, here is the follow-up and it most certainly DOES NOT dissapoint.  Even though, most american fans don't speak German, they still dig Rammstein because their music is packed with emotional intensity.  The band has greatly matured here.  Sure there are enough power chords here to satisfy the &quot;du hast&quot; crowd (like myself) but there are some slower, more melodic segments, such as the title track that prove Rammstein are capable of more than just fast riffing.  To sum this puppy up,  If Rammstein are the Metallica of Germany ( I HATE to compare) this is their &quot;Load&quot;.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This movie is SO boring! It drags and drags. DON'T buy this movie.
B000059MEK|3.0|After all the hype about Discovery, I'm just a tiny bit disappointed. These boys are definitely clever and cool and have all their pop references down. In it's own dumb way it's extremely smart. <br />However, despite they're apparent womb-to-adulthood immersion in pop style, too little real songsmithing seems to have rubbed off. A lot of their taking off points, like the great Kraftwerk and Chic, created confections as airy as these, but more put-together in ways that look positively Byzantine by comparison. If you're going to appropriate something with a cute ironic twist, at least fully appreciate it.<br />There is too littly variation per song -- no build, no bridges. The same gimmick or hook just gets worked and worked and worked to death (a la Fat Boy Slim, another critic-adored master of overworked single ideas). However (again, like Fat Boy Slim) it is invariably a great hook or gimmick and that's why I find myself returning despite my misgivings.  They will be perfect in advertisements for cars, computers and brokerage firms in a few months as cool once again gets masticated and barfed up for reeating by the pseudo-hip rubes of USA Inc.<br />In the meantime, it's nice to see Paris, a city with a gay socialist mayor, becoming the capital of cool again.
B00005AAFS|5.0|It's been SO long since their newest cd I almost forgot how incredable Rammstein is. After waiting you'd think anything would sound good, but this just isn't anything. It seems like they put alot effort into their cd's, all the tracks are great and it does'nt matter if you don't speak German. IT just matters that it sounds badass, right? Also if you get the chance, catch them in concert. It's well worth it, trust me, especially if you like pyrotecnics.
014028009X|4.0|Okay, I've already read both books and I've just watched the movie.  I have to say that Bridget Jones is a very amusing read, and you don't have to relate to the girl to appreciate her antics.  It takes a bit to get used to Bridget's writing and lingo, but you catch on and relish in your amusement.  It mirrors P&amp;P fairly well, with a &quot;Mr. Wickham&quot; and an honest-to-goodness Mr. Darcy, but you didn't have to read P&amp;P to enjoy the book.<br />I personally loved the second book more than the first (so go out and get the second one too) but that's because I am a big fan of Persuasion.  And watch the movie!  I don't mean to promo, but if you didn't love Colin Firth already from P&amp;P, you'll love him now.  Sigh!
B00003CX8N|5.0|Helene Hanff's 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD is one of the few films I have watched many, many times and have never tired of its wonderful story, great acting and inspiring picture of a life-long friendship.<br />Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are a perfect match for this timeless story that spans the literal breadth of the Atlantic Ocean and some 20 years in time. The supporting cast including the always-engaging Judy Dench, round out a superbly-written screenplay.<br />This film will make you laugh, and cry and sometimes both at the same time. It resonates so much with not only the joy of finding a great book, but also with the connections books bring to our daily lives, and those friendships that arise and/or continue over the lively discussions of a wonderful book you have shared with someone. <br />A wonderful movie to share with a fellow book lover, or just a good friend!
6305171769|3.0|I am a really huge Halloween fan and was a little dissapointed in this one. First of all it was not as scary. Second, there were only 6 killings.Halloween 1-6 had more killings than this one did, you would think this one would have more killings since it was the latest installment. It was still good but not as good as the others. I don't suggest you buy it unless you need to complete the Halloween collection at home.
0345350499|4.0|I get really tired of books that &quot;re-write&quot; the story of Camelot.  Every year brings a new slew of them.  But &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; transforms itself into a classic worthy of being grouped with &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;.  <br />Mists of Avalon's biggest strength and flaw is that it goes head to head with the morality of the original legend of King Arthur.  13th century society gave us our most lasting legends of Camelot, but those stories are laced with that period's sensibility, namely that women and sex bring the downfall of mankind.   Mists re-writes the legend with a modern perspective.  Morgana is no longer the evil woman bent on the destruction of Camelot, but instead a priestess of the Druidic religion trying to defend her beliefs against Christianity.<br />This perspective is interesting because it is true that in the 5th and 6th centuries Christianity was settling into England and facing off with the woman-centered Druidic religion.  Camelot would have existed during a time of immense social change, dealing not only with the constant invasions of the Saxons, but also with new ideas of morality.  <br />Some people may dislike this book because of its bias towards the Druidic religion, and its portrayal of Christianity as being dogmatic and anti-woman.   But this book is not the feminist, anti-christian pocketbook everyone seems to think it is.  King Arthur is still the noble, ahead-of-his-time man we always loved.  He is not destroyed by Guinevere's affair, instead he is a man destroyed by the littleness of humankind (both men and women).  Morgana is a woman trying to keep the dignity of women intact.  All are searching for ways to do the right thing.<br />This book is unfair in that it puts a 21st century view head-to-head with 13th century Christianity.  We are no longer the Christians who pay money to be forgiven of our sins.  Our bishops don't go around impegranating hundreds of women.  The reformation came and went, and women are not considered so evil anymore.  But the legends of Arthur we learn in school are based on this previous version of Christianity.  This book stands in response.<br />Mists may not be fair to Christianity as it exists today, but it is fair to it as it existed during the age of the Inquisition.  It reminds us that Camelot should be remembered in legend as a place where women as well as men strived for nobility and grace.  The littleness of both is what destroyed it.<br />Gracefully written and thought-provoking.  A book you can't put down. (8 out of 10)
B000002V07|4.0|This is not an album to buy if you are a casual music listener. This is not an album to buy if music is something you view as something to be in the background while you do something else.<br />If you view music as something you DO, something you ARE, something you PLAN for, and set aside time for, and unplug the phone and lock the door and settle into the quiet confines of your listening room for, then this album is for you.<br />Dark &amp; dreamy, vocals like a haunted, phantom ship at night, dripping with dismay, vibrating with hope (no pun intended....) if these images appeal to you, then try this. But please, do yourself a favor; don't listen to it in the daytime; don't listen to it while doing something else, and listen to it the whole time through.

B00003CXB2|5.0|Glorious 2-disc set that does ample justice to Lean's epic masterpiece. I'm afraid I didn't notice the &quot;errors&quot; mentioned by one of the previous reviewers. Though I did notice Anthony Quinn's obviously dubbed voice during the restored scene when he asks Arthur Kennedy not to take his picture. The picture was startlingly clear at times and every grain of sand is visible. Also liked the fabric casing for the DVD box. The cornerstone of any DVD library. Hope Columbia does as good a job on Doctor Zhivago and Ryan's Daughter.
B000056K04|5.0|When I heard that Dave Matthews Band was going to release a more studio enhanced album, I must say, I was disappointed.  However, it occured to me after listening to the new album that this was definitely a good decision.  With Everyday, Dave Matthews Band has released music with a fresh, new feel.  With this evolution in their music, they have reached a new caliber as a band.  I have always loved their music, but I am definitely impressed by this new sound.  It is a great album, the entire thing is very well-executed.  Verdict: Dave Matthews Band strikes again.
B000056NX4|5.0|This movie is absolutley WONDERFUL, I thought the acting was the best ever, compared to the 1973 movie of Jesus Christ superstar, this one blows it out'a the water!! The end is so powerful, and the acting is great, when the crucified him, the tears just come out, you cant hold'em back!!! I suggest this movie to anyone, it's just awesome!!
0201633612|5.0|I disagree with some of the negative reviews here. This is a very good book on software design using OO method. But being able to read this book requires some experience. Not the kind of experience in writing 500-line programs or small routines. You have to actually designed at least one project of significant size to understand what the authors are talking about, and then you will enjoy the elegance of the solutions.
0425170349|1.0|I started reading this book expecting another Hunt for Red October, but it was different.  I didn't expect a &quot;clean&quot; book concerning swearing, but it was a little over done.  It was a well written book, as Tom Clancy usually puts out.<br />My advice is that this book is for older teens or adults.

0066620694|4.0|Comment:  This review is part of an assignment for the E-commerce MBA class at San Jose State University.  <br />The Innovators Dilemma is an interesting book about the problems that larger organizations have trying to compete with start-ups in new markets.  The book discusses how larger companies rarely are successful in developing products for emerging or non-existent markets.  <br />The book provides some very relevant examples how larger companies--primarily in the technology sector, but not limited to them--often find themselves stuck trying to satisfy their current, and large, customers.  This often precludes them from devoting resources to new technologies for emerging markets, due to the fact that those markets do not yet exist, and will not provide adequate revenues to maintain a required level of growth.<br />The Innovators Dilemma is generally well written, but at times a bit verbose.  I found that some sections were difficult to follow, due to the grammar that is used.  I found the book interesting, although there are a lot of examples revolving around the disk drive industry, which personally I do not have a lot of interest in.  <br />This book is likely to be helpful for managers of companies that have or use some sort of technology that sets them apart from their competitors.  In particular, this will be helpful for managers at the larger companies that need to have large revenue growth year over year.  It could also be helpful for managers of smaller companies, especially those who are designing products that do not have a market yet, so they are able to understand what the competitive advantage that they will have over the large companies providing the existing technology.<br />This book does intend to give managers ideas how to avoid the \\"dilemma,\\" however it is my impression that it would be very difficult for one, or even a group of, individual manager to change the companies' focus to the point necessary to avoid the trap.  There are many changes that one must incur to avoid the problem of trying to satisfy current customers who are providing your revenue stream, including garnering support from upper management and other stakeholders, as well as altering the processes and values of the organization.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book to mangers who have decision making authority or influence in companies that produce or use technology products.  It provides an interesting viewpoint, although I feel that it is a bit too limited to be of use to a wider audience.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Unfortunately, the star system would not let me give 0 stars, so I am saying that it deserves 0 stars.  At first I thought this album was awesome.  I listened to some of the songs and realized that it is one of the worst existing CD's of all time.  The lyrics are horrible (take 'hot dog' for example.  I've never heard so much use of the 'F' word.  I think he says it about 50 times (honestly).  I recommend this CD to nobody.  It is terrible.  If you listen to it the first time, you'll think its cool.  Listen again.  Its like you're listening to a new, bad CD.  NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
0385335482|5.0|This is a wonderful book, both because of its humor, and the way in which Kinsella shows the destructive side of Rebecca's compulsive shopping.  Her downward spiral is not only a vicarious thrill, but a lesson to shopaholics everywhere.  I both identified with Rebecca, and was relieved that I am not quite that bad.  Although Rebecca may bear some resemblance to Bridget Jones (i.e., writing career, attraction to the snobbish rich guy) Kinsella's narrower focus sets &quot;Shopaholic&quot; apart.  In addition, I think Kinsella takes her heroine's struggle a little more seriously, although there are plenty of laughs along the way (especially in Rebecca's letters from creditors).  Although everything seems to work out okay in the end for both women, I sense that Rebecca's success was more hard-won, lasting, and the result of lessons learned.

0790749998|3.0|I went to see this movie in the theaters and was not impressed with the storyline. The effects were good, but the plot was lacking. Also, Aaliyah and jet-li (our Romeo and Juliet) didn't really have great chemistry, I wasn't convinced that this was a tale of star crossed lovers. Basically, they seemed like two people thrown together who became good buddies and united in a common goal, except it never got that intense. Aaliyah is great to watch because she is stunningly beautiful and she does not do a BAD job for her first acting role. Jet Li is amazing to watch in action. The movie had bits of comedy. However, nothing came together to make a good story. The acting as a whole was semi-good at best, though you could tell the actors were trying to make it strong.<br />I'm glad I went to see this in the theater for the fight scenes and the effects. But the movie itself isn't all that great.
B000000OPZ|4.0|I give this album 4 stars, the songs such as Still of the night, looking for love, is this love, crying in the rain are fully inspiration. I read about DC last night from his fan club, he said that the song Still of the night has nothing to do with the arrogant led zeppelin sound.....as many ZEP fanatical fans thought. The story behind the song that DC found the old rehearsal tape from his old days with deep Purple, and listened to the blackmore snatch riff. DC messed with it and changed it around to his own version &amp; finally gave it to John Sykes to try it,...wha agreat riff and inspiration from his old school deep purple days.  I personally enjoying the new version of crying in the rain, John Sykes is a good guitar player who also admired Deep Purple in his teenie days, if you love Deep purple, you will love this album too,....
014028009X|5.0|I deliberately held off from reading this novel because I'd heard Colin Firth was the romantic lead.  I loved him in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and when I heard this was a modern reworking of that favorite novel and series, I wanted to \\"save\\" myself.  I'm glad I did because the two works are very different.  Firth plays the hero, Mark Darcy, and Hugh Grant, the romantic rat, Daniel Cleaver, Bridget's boss. The movie is much more romantic than the novel, with Firth and Grant onscreen the majority of the time.  Renee Zellwegger does a bang up job as Bridget but the men do take time away from her that they didn't in the novel.  The novel, by contrast, is Bridget's with the two men really being supporting characters.  The novel is funnier because you are reading Bridget's LOL diary entries.<br /><br />The movie is also funny but that accent is shared with the overall romantic mood.  I promptly began reading the novel just hours after having seen the movie. Bridget's life as an early 30s single in London, who wants to find a boyfriend, is about as timely and universal a theme and a plot as possible. It's the entertaining way she writes her diary that \\"makes\\" the novel.  It is the three leads, Zellweger, Firth and Grant who \\"make\\" the film.  The screenwriter reworked many of the scenes and got rid of many scenes altogether, which if you adored the novel may be a problem for you. I didn't have this problem since I did them in reverse order.  Bridget's mother remains a comic and controlling force in both versions and she goes about her own way of \\"finding herself\\" with an oily tv con man from the continent.  She nevertheless advises her daughter throughout and, just like the mother in \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" is right in her advice even though you think she hasn't a brain in her head!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00003CWOL|2.0|This movie would not have been so terrible if it was not supposed to be in line with the Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy series.  To those of us that truly enjoyed Clerks, there is no low budget elegance about this one.  There is no absence of the mainstream media explosion that you find in the other three (okay, maybe two, but we'll forgive Chasing Amy).  This movie may have ranked a four, but not tied to one of the best movie series ever.  It's like teats on a bull, it just don't belong.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Sequels are rarely better than the original (The Empire Strikes Back is an exception) but most often they are not this disappointing. What will let you down the most is the poor script; too many important scenes from the book have not been used, the final confrontation between dr. Lecter and Starling is ridiculous, it lacks refinement and there are simply too many one-liners that are simply not funny (even though some were obviously intended to be).  Great actors (Hopkins, Oldman, Giannini and Liotta) but Moore does never convince as Starling. Jody Foster could not have saved this movie but she might have made it a bit less hard to swallow. Buying this movie is not the best way to spend 20+ dollars. Read the book or get Silence of the Lambs on DVD, in case you havn't got that yet.
0345404475|2.0|I first saw the movie BladeRunner before I read the book. The book to me was hard to understand  especialy when Isidore had hallucinations or dreams. The book did not explain who Mercer is or who the killers are. The androids in the book seemed stupid compared to the ones in the movies and made less an effort to survive or fight back. The book was partialy intresting but became boring at the end.
B0000560RV|5.0|Another classical/rock hybrid, with influences including minimalism via the more romantic end of minimalism's gray spectrum (Part, Rautavaara and perhaps Tavener), rather than the drier Philip Glass end; also in the mix we hear various early 20th century composers from, er, cold Northern European countries, with Sibelius, Alnaes, and one or two others in there as well. <br />And so you have drones, interesting slowish chord progressions, pretty keyboard and guitar sounds; but after a listen or two you find that it isn't merely ambient. Minimalism's key flaw (or the reason it generally fails to hold my interest) is that it's about texture rather than structure; it either doesn't go anywhere, or it moves so very slowly that I generally can't be bothered hanging around waiting for the composer to make another decision, like putting the notes somewhere different this time around.  But Sigur Ros write and play pieces that aren't as static as they seem. They change and build, with reasonably interesting structures that develop, progress, and occasionally even climax; they go somewhere.<br />As for the unintelligibility of the lyrics, I expect that's a plus.  I remember quite liking Smashing Pumpkins until I actually bothered to listen to the words and discovered Billy Corgan's spoilt-brat whining.  Whatever the Hopelandic is about, by the sound of it it's neither whining nor violent nor tritely-easily cynical, and so that makes it better than most lyrics anyway.  :)        <br />Most people figure this album for the bastard son of Kid-A, but I expect the influences on the rock side go further back than that.  Eno, obviously, and Pink-Floyd-when-they-were-good, ie Meddle and More and Saucer and Piper, and not Dark Side or anything later.  And - a band that is probably not known at all in the States, but I think a regular visitor to Iceland - the Ayers/Wyatt and then Mike Ratledge-period Soft Machine.  <br />So, this is good music. And yes, easily in the 10 best albums of 2000.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon
B00005B3Z5|5.0|As someone who has the benefit of watching PAL (British/European) formatted video, I'm fortunate to have the original release of QAF 1 and 2 from the UK.  This is the series that started it all. While the American version of this series has definitely improved and the actors have gotten more comfortable in their roles, I have to say I still find the British version superior with respect to acting and with the more gritty, realistic view of what gay life is like in a working class city.  The American version is still a bit polished and its portrayal of the gay nightlife is a bit surreal.  While the American version pushes the sex envelope a bit further than the UK version, you have to realize that in the UK this was shown on Channel Four, which would be an equivalent of NBC in America.  Imagine NBC (or ABC or CBS or anything not on a premium cable channel) showing this!! As the analogy goes, America is cutting edge with violence and the British with sex.  The original version is definitely worth getting your hands on.  I think you'll find the characters are multidimensional and considerably more realistic. (and if you have the capability to play PAL tapes, buy these tapes from amazon.co.uk as they include the original soundtrack which is far superior to the sad thing they had to do these tapes to comply with licensing them in North America).
B00000K3UR|4.0|In a cynical view of this movie, you could probably say that Adam Sandler made it to impress critics. However, this is probably my least favorite Adam Sandler movie for lots of reasons. Above all, it gets WAY too sappy. I mean most AS movies get sappy intentionally, but come one, the whole montage scene at the end was too much. Secondly, it strives for the kind of coolness factor ala the Kevin Smith films, Swingers, and the like. AS films were never meant to be as mentally challenging as those films, and I know I sound like the average AS fan when I say all this. However, not all is bad. There are some funny lines/scenes (all he does is eat and sleep, he's like a damn cocker spaniel) but mainly, the film fails because it tries to hard. However, you could say that AS achieved his goal-most critics liked it, however I don't.
B000002NHN|5.0|This is McKennitt's newest album, and possibly one of her best. Unlike some of her earlier albums that tend to be all one tempo, there is a well-balanced blend of fast and slow songs, each beautiful in a unique way. While others commented that her diction tends to be poor, this is not always the case, and her voice is one of the most pure and tone-filled I've ever heard. While &quot;Mummer's Dance&quot; tends to be the most talked-about song on this album, my personal favorites also include &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; (which is even more moving if you're familiar with The Divine Comedy) and &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; a beautiful interpretation of Noyes' famous poem. While her songs may tend to be rather long for some, I find they are the perfect length to really get into the music. This and her last album, The Mask and the Mirror, show McKennitt's musical expansion, particularly with the use of percussion and different tempos. Her notes in the cd booklet explain her inspirations and sources for her songs; if possible, read these as well to get a better understanding of the historical backgrounds of her songs. Though others have tried to imitate McKennitt's style, I've never found anyone who can quite match up to her unique music (and believe me, I've looked.)  If you've never heard McKennitt before, this is the perfect album with which to start.
0788816454|5.0|This is not my favorite, or least favorite AS film, but it's good for laughs. As with all his films, they show that endurance and perserverance rule! (heheh) Seriously, The Waterboy is a classic because so many scenes/lines are etched into our brains (WATER SUCKS!) and because it achieves the AS goal perfectly-not even Happy Gilmore, which I consider his best, did that-but it's better because it has more funnier scenes. I mean, you have to either be a cynical freak or stuck-up critic to deny that you were NOT rooting for the Muddogs at the end of the film. A great american, football, Adam Sandler classic.
0671449028|5.0|If you want a book to read to your little one that satisfies their need for simple sing song rhymes but isn't dripping because it's so sweet, Sandra fits the bill. Alex loves the pictures and the rhythm. (Mommy does too!) His library now consists of 7 Boyntons and we're not done yet.
B000000OAH|1.0|Jazz is one of my least favorite Queen CD's. Besides Mustapha and Don't Stop Me Now, this album is to be avoided at all costs.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Even though I love rock music, and I thought the soundtrack to this movie was excellent, and I thought the acting was admirable, the storyline in Almost Famous is ludicrous and boring.  This was an opportunity to make a great, or at least fun, movie about the music and larger than life characters from 1970s rock and roll.  Instead, it's a flop.  The movie gives us an excellent soundtrack, but we learn nothing about the artists who made that music.  It presents us with some interesting characters, but they are not portrayed in any depth.  There is some potential in the storyline -- a 15 year old away from home for the first time touring with a rock band -- but the story we are given is boring mishmash about flunkie groupies and shallow, moronic rock stars.<br />How anyone could have watched this movie and liked it is a complete mystery to me.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is my FAVORITE Queen CD, and it has their best songs on here. Here is my review of all of the songs: 1. Death on Two Legs: This song is an awesome opening song to this album. The guitar riffs and the vocals on this song are perfect. 2. Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon: A perfect example of how different Queen was. They could do hard rock/metal, then they could put out songs like this. Peaceful and interesting. 3. I'm In Love with My Car: This song is a good rock song sung by Roger (The Drummer). Good example of how he could sing and play drums very well. 4. You're My Best Friend: I'm one of the few people who doesn't like this song. I don't know why, but I don't. 5. '39: Good Brian May song. Peaceful and it sounds nice. 6. Sweet Lady: I didn't really like this song either, but it has good guitar riffs. 7. Seaside Rendezous: Same as Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon. 8. The Prophet's Song: The BEST song on the album. Wonderful guitars, and a cool vocal part in the middle of the song. 9. Love of My Life: A really pretty song full of good piano and vocals. 10. Good Company: Never really liked this one either.  11. Bohemian Rhapsody: Good song, almost as good as The Prophet Song. It would be better with the middle part cut out. 12. God Save The Queen: Good guitar song.

6304626495|4.0|Excellent movie, truly worthy of the Python name, but falls short of the Holy Grail. Can be rather slow at times, but mostly hilarious. If it wasn't for what I think of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I'd gladly give this movie five stars.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|A neat throwback to the war/adventure stories of a bygone era. The movie is fun, tense, and engaging with great, realistic performances. They took great liberties with the story, but it's not claiming to be a documentary. All in all, it only attempts to be a crackling thriller and on that level it succeeds. For a fun/historical treat watch the movie, then tour the U-505 at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.

B0000542DJ|5.0|if you're reading this or any of the other reviews of this film then i don't need 2 go in2 details about this movie or the details and circumstances surrounding the events in dallas on nov. 22, 1963. what i did notice was that the facts in this movie come fast and furious, especially when donald sutherland, an informant who goes by the name of 'mr. x', starts running off details about a military cover-up. there seem to be some dramatic license used, like the hopped-up-on-cigs-and-coffee portrayal of david ferrie by joe pesci (he's always manic, isn't he?), the swishiness of clay shaw(bertrand) played by tommy lee jones, and kevin bacon's prison character. the effect i got of the film was that it got me thinking about what went on behind the scenes of the assassination and who was behind what. every review i've read seems to state the fact that oliver stone is giving us an answer to the whole thing, which i think is not true. because if u read between the lines of all the details in the film, some speculation and some fact, u will c that there are many sides to this complex and unnerving story . plus, yeah, it is hollywood, and it is not a documentary, so someone has to ride off in2 the sunset. my favorite performance in the movie is gary oldman as lee harvey oswald. he seems to capture the essence of this &quot;patsy&quot; to the letter; i don't know if there is anything out on LHO for oldman to be able to capture mannerisms, tics, etc., or if it was the work of oldman himself, plain and simple. there is so much detail to be seen, some details that are left out (or we'd be siiting there 4 5-6 hrs. at least, to cover all teh angles), and not a minute to be missed. hopefully it gets u thinking about this whole thing and it leads u 2 believe what u will. fantastic casting all around; walter matthau (as sen. huey long? i'm not sure),for me, gets this whole ball rolling, and it's his 5 minutes at the beginning that are critical to the film.
6303433766|4.0|The true story of two teenaged girls living in New Zealand in the early `50s, \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" directed by Peter Jackson, is a riveting, sometimes intense drama that examines the fast friendship between Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), and the effects of that friendship, on not only themselves, but on their families and friends as well.  From a working class family, at fourteen, Pauline was shy and prone to introspection, recording her most intimate thoughts daily in a diary.  Originally from England, Juliet was the new girl in town; from a well-to-do family, she was well traveled, her father a professor of some stature.  Gregarious and outgoing, she was also given to flights of fancy, all of which appealed to Pauline immediately.  Brash and vivacious, Juliet was everything Pauline would never be; and Pauline was writing a novel, an endeavor in which Juliet quickly joined her.  Together, they would write and act out their romantic notions of brave knights and fair ladies, and Juliet shared with Pauline her knowledge of \\"The Fourth World,\\" a place to which she would one day go instead of heaven.  By the time they were fifteen, they were virtually inseparable.  They were \\"best\\" friends in every sense of the word.<br /> Director Jackson does a magnificent job of taking you into the world of Pauline and Juliet.  By contrasting the reality with the fantasy, he gives you an excellent sense of what they were all about, how they related to one another (as well as to others), and most importantly, their collective mind set which enabled them to actually embark upon their chosen path.  the girls' dream world is presented with a lyrical style that makes the happy times uplifting, and enhances the impact when things turn dark.  Throughout the film, passages are read verbatim from Pauline's diaries, which adds such stark realism to the events as they unfold, that in the end it produces a veritable sense of awe.  To see the things depicted here in a movie is one thing, but when you stop and think about the fact that two such \\"normal\\" young girls were capable of doing what they did, it is indeed sobering.  And when you learn what finally became of Pauline and Juliet, it merely adds to the incredulity of it all.<br /> This film marked the screen debuts of Winslet and Lynskey, and in Winslet's case, this film could have been subtitled \\"A Star Is Born.\\"  From the opening frames, in which her talent, beauty and charismatic screen presence are readily apparent, there was no doubt as to the direction her career would soon be taking.  In retrospect, this was a great role with which to jump start her career, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands and created a truly memorable character, using her natural poise and charm to the ultimate effect.  Winslet not only played the character, she discovered the spirit that moved Juliet and used it to the fullest extent to bring her to life here.  It's a genuinely auspicious and incredible performance.<br /> That Lynskey hasn't fared as well in her career as Winslet has since this film was made is in no way a reflection upon her performance in it.  Pauline is perfectly realized by Lynskey, but due to the more solemn nature of the character, it was almost as if she was predestined to be overshadowed here by Winslet.  But the credit for making the on screen relationship between the girls work so well, and the fact that it is so believable, has to be distributed equally between the two actresses.  And it was Lynskey's ability to evoke and surround herself with an ambience of darkness that allowed Winslet's light to shine so brightly.  <br /> The supporting cast includes Sarah Peirse (Honora), Diana Kent (Hilda), Clive Merrison (Henry), Simon O'Connor (Herbert), Jed Brophy (John), Peter Elliott (Bill), Gilbert Goldie (Dr. Bennett) and Kirsti Ferry (Wendy).  Watching such extraordinary circumstances being played out so matter-of-factly by such seemingly ordinary peoplecan be a thought provoking experience, but in the case of \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" it's profoundly disturbing.  There's nothing quite so jarring as realizing the facility with which certain boundaries can in fact be traversed, and when it happens, it's like a slap in the face from reality.  And that's what this film does.  It's an engrossing tale that will prick up the hairs on your neck of awareness, and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark.
B000002KB8|5.0|This album really rocks! When I listen to it I see black and orange inside out plastic squids that fit together in a perfect pattern.  Ozzy's voice sounds like a ripe watermellon dragster U.F.O. that is peeling out down a cobble stone street during the Inqusition.   If I was in a terrible motorcycle accident and was being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, as I was starting to get dizzy from loss of blood, the sirens would start to sound like the guitar in the Wizard. Of course, all the dogs and cats would have Mickey Mouse ears on and have human lips and be a lot smarter than usual and able to make decent money in the hospitality services industry.
0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies. With exception of The Godfather &amp; The Godfather Part II, and of course Scarface. The film is rather long, but it don't seem that way when your watching it. Led with an all star cast of Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II, Casino), Ray Liotta (Blow, Hannibal), Joe Pesci (JFK, Casino), Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown). <br />The film is about the life of Hank Hill, (Liotta), who from when he is young he wanted to be a gangster, but maybe he asked for more than he was bargaining for. Led with Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and his hotheaded, childhood buddy Tommy DeVito (Academy Award Winner Joe Pesci), they do anything and everything. From robbing loads of trucks, (and all their merchandise), to contract killing, nothing is left out in this true, adapted story, or true life gangster Hank Hill.<br />This movie is one of my all time favorite mob flicks, that made Joe Pesci the star he is today. This film is easily one of Scorsese's best movies. (With the possible exception of Taxi Driver or Raging Bull).<br />The Only Bad Thing About The DVD Is It Single Layered, meaning You Have To Change It About 1/2 Way Through The Film.<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />Chapter List<BR>Theatrical Trailer(s)
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the best bands out there, and i can tell they will be around for a long time. In the album Aenima, tool really sets you off with roaring guitars, pounding drums, and Keenan's vocals. To tell you the truth, its very hard to put in words to say how great Tool really is. Just think if there was a scale from 1 to 100, I would pick something like 100,000,000,000,000/or mabye more. There is no reason that you can hate this band, no reason at all. So go out and buy this album and you will be suprised.

B00004U8P3|5.0|I love this movie. I have to say that it's very different from the book, but it's still a smash hit. I own it and have watched it about 1000 times. My favorite part is where Big Rex catches the attacking raptor while he's already in the air because he was going to pounce on the people.

0440234743|4.0|The Testament by John Grisham/Fiction; Random House, 1999:<br />Troy Phelan, the tenth richest man in America with holding estimated at 11 billion dollars, is staring into the eyes of death.  With only hours left Troy is being examined by three psychologists, one from each ex-spouse, to make sure he is mentally sound in order to sign this last will.  After each psychologist has had his shot at Troy they all agree unanimously that he indeed is mentally sound.  Watching in another room via cameras all three families are pleased they will finally be getting their millions.  The psychologists and families vacate the Phelan building, Troy's hardly humble tower, but before of the property Troy pulls out a new, hand written will.  After signing it he slowly creeps from his wheelchair.  His lawyer Josh Stafford, Josh's assistant, Durban, and Troy's maid, Snead, the only people still present did not notice until it was too late.  Troy had walked outside on the terrace, and jumped over the rail, plummeting to his death.  After getting over the shock Josh Stafford opened and read the will on camera saying that he was present during the signing and saw that indeed Troy Phelan did sign it.  The biggest shock yet came while reading the will, which left most of Troy Phelan's fortune to an unknown, illegitimate daughter, a missionary named Rachel Lane.   The Testament, an action suspense novel by John Grisham, clearly portrays his unique style of writing where each character seems to be written by one whom has experienced all the hardships the character goes through.  With Troy Phelan every little move was calculated ahead of time. Troy Phelan's descent did not reach the level of high drama he had dreamed of.  Instead of diving to the earth like an angel, a perfect swan dive with the silk robe trailing behind, and landing in death before his terror stricken families, whom he'd imagined be leaving the building at just the right moment, his fall was witnessed by a lowly payroll clerk...  (The Testament, page 22)     Nate O'Riley, who was struggling to recover from his alcoholism, fell into a deep state of self-sympathy while in Brazil.  While describing this scene Grisham leads the reader to believe that Nate O'Riley is speaking to you, not the author Jon Grisham. Late in the afternoon he stopped in a small deli a few blocks from the hotel.  He was roaming the side-walks, saw that the deli was open, and walked into it with the hope of finding a beer.  He was alone on the far side of the world.  It was Christmas and he had no one to share it with.  A wave of loneliness and depression fell hard upon Nate, and he began to slide.  Self-pity seized him.  He saw the rows of bottles of liquor, all full and unopened, whiskeys and gins and vodkas, lined up like pretty little soldiers in bright uniforms.  His mouth was instantly dry, even parched.  His jaw dropped and his eyes closed.   (The Testament, page 150)  Through both Grisham's excellent writing and the great plot, The Testament has been a great read.  John Grisham has been writing very similar book over the past few novels which includes a protagonist running from his past.  In this narrative you can see similar qualities with Rachel Lane however through creating several main characters: Nate O'Riley, Josh Stafford and Rachel Lane, Grisham has created a new frame which is a spectacular read.
B000056VIY|4.0|While J.Lo has been flanked down by many bad reviews, and people who don't listen to the music but rather judge Jennifer herself, it can be a very hard decision whether to buy the album or not. But take it from my personal opinion, when I say that J.Lo is a mix of Latin, R&amp;B, Pop, Techno Pop, that is very suitable for just about anybody's taste, because as you can see Jennifer brings out the flavor without going overboard. Although many producers, writers, and mixers were hired during the making of this album, nothing seems to bring down this album, not even that. Many highlights on this album including the current hit &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; a high-driven R&amp;B sensation, with an incredible beat and is directed to the females who are able to obtain everything they own without the help of any males, females unite on this track, &quot;Play&quot; the new single, and inevitably will be a club smash not to mention a top 5 hit yet again, it's got the Madonna thing going on with the &quot;Mr. DJ,&quot; but Jennifer keeps it Original. This song will keep you dancing because the beat is hypnotizing, and the electronic sound is nothing short of amazing. &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot; or should be dubbed &quot;Waiting For Tonight Part II,&quot; yet another romance song about falling in love with the one you love, you can absolutely tell that Jennifer's voice is technically enhanced via the vocoder. Last but not least the salsa flamenco &quot;Dame&quot; here she duets with another Latin artist Chayanne, who sounds very good with Jennifer singing, this might appeal to the latin audience or anybody that enjoys latin numbers. The beat is great, and Jennifer's vocals are at their best. <br />The only downfall on this CD, is the written for Britney Spears reject &quot;Dance With Me&quot; which sounds as though Jennifer got hooked on the teeny-bopper explosion and decided to follow the trend.<br />I'm recommending this CD to anybody that enjoys fresh talent, and dancing in-your-face type of music that will get anybody grooving.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Enema of the State sounds very un-similar to the great Dude Ranch.But does that even matter if it still works?Who cares if it isn't as hardcore punk as it used to be.Who cares if they sold out?Enema of the State is still a very good album, even if they did go mainstream.The big question though, is Enema as good as Ranch?Not quite.At times it's over poppy (All the Small Things) and over produced.But Blink do what they do best...make catchy tunes with guitar riffs and drum beats that you can't get out of your head for a month. - 1.Dumpweed:A pretty solid guitar riff by Tom Delonge is the highlight of the song.It's about girls and if you didn't know yet, Blink writes about girls,A LOT!The slow,pretty part, which most of the songs have on this album, is at 1:45 - 2.Don't Leave Me:A lot of wit and humor in this song about girls.It's catchy like almost all of the songs on this cd and has the slow,pretty part at 1:20. - 3.Aliens Exist:The only song not about girls with the first real catchy chorus on the album. - 4.Another incredibly catchy tune with a lot of bubble gum/pop flavor.It's about girls too but this is one of the best written songs on the cd and has some really nice arrangements.The slow pretty part comes in at 2:20 with a nice drum and guitar solo. - 5.What's My Age Again?:The first &quot;hit&quot;, but unlike All the Small Things this song is actually good.A song that's great from start to finish.The slow,pretty part is at 1:10.Oh yeah,the song's about girls. - 6.Dysentary Gary:My favorite track on the album!It switches from fast to slow, and funny to serious.Delonge's best song ever.The best part of the song is when Hoppus comes in though, at 1:40.The slow,pretty part is at 2:20. - 7.Adam's Song:A song that most punk bands wish they could come up with.I'm not speaking lyrically of course (it tends to get off-subject), I'm talking musically.It's a power ballod that Hoppus,like always,delivers perfectly.This song is one gigantic slow,pretty tune. - 8.All the Small Things:Can someone say &quot;...To think a punk band would actually make this song,let alone make this the single!?!?!The slow pretty part is at 1:45 and I sware I've heard it before in a Christina Agulera song.Well,maybe not,but it sounds like it. - 9.The Party Song - A fast punk/poppy tune about girl at a party.Although it does slow down a bit,it always maintains its energy. - 10.Mutt:A song (about girls) that not a lot of people liked, but it's my second favorite on the album.Awesome drums and Delonge's trademark hummable guitars.The slow,pretty part kicks in at 2:45. - 11.Wendy Clear:The second worst song on the album.It's not nearly as bad or poppy as All the Small Things though. - 12.Anthem:This is the ultimate party song,even though track 9 is called The Party Song.It's loud and Delonge sings with a lot of emotion.It's even kind of catchy when &quot;I time bomb&quot; comes in.The slow pretty part is at 2:20. - Note:If you like Fenix TX,Sum 41,MxPx,The Get Up Kids,Ataris, or New Found Glory than you MUST buy this one.Well,at leat give it some consideration.
0743506650|3.0|It is said to be good at something you study masters, a golfer would probably look to Tiger Woods.<br />I guess for a writer Stephen King is a good person to study.<br />The book begins with a brief autobiography, ending at approximately his kicking his drinking and drug habits.  Interesting as background but little of it explains how it helped his writing.<br />The second half is King's approach to writing; which seems a bit extreme(4-6 hours of writing/reading a day!), but his ideas on dialog, adverbs(avoid at all costs!), descriptions, plot and revising are on the mark.<br />As an aspiring writer, I suggest you take Kings advice as suggestions as opposed to a plan.

B000056N8X|3.0|Highlander Endgame was great. The acting was good, effects excellent, and it is very entertaining. The only flaw is the storyline. The storyline doesn't follow the original plot, and is somewhat hard to learn. In the first highlander we learned there could only be 1 immortal left to win the prize. 2 and 3 both explained a way for there to be more immortals. This one didn't. The plot didn't follow the original story, and it was a little hard to follow at sometimes. The movie is great, and I recommend it to everyone if your a highlander fan.
B00003CWN2|5.0|Roger Ebert said in his review that this story - based on true events - could have been handled badly - could have gone wrong at many turns - but everything was handled just right, and I couldn't agree more.<br />From the start, even those unfamiliar with the documentary surrounding this dramatization will feel the essential sense of fatality and inevitability that drive this tragic tale to its logical end as it begins its slow progression from a quirky slice-of-life comedy to a dark study of many conflicting characters and a powerful social commentary.<br />A second viewing will reveal still further what a finely crafted gem this picture is. The reality-based events are placed as strategic set-pieces with a sometimes warped chronology and given fascinating spins - I don't know how much artistic license was employed (I imagine it must have been a lot) but fully justifiable for such a satisfying end result. The documentary is the shell and THIS is the filling, the substance, the meaning. The questions that arise from any study of this case are ANSWERED here, in a very satisfying way.<br />There is phenomenal acting on display here in all roles particularly the lead (Hilary Swank).<br />And before I leave, I must mention the masterful dialog utilized in this film - It strikes the perfect balance between believability and significance. Lines are as realistic as possible within the context they're spoken yet still allow characters to say what NEEDS to be said - I'm talking about PROFUNDITY with a capital P.<br />Outstanding movie - well worth anyone's time and money.
B0000508U6|3.0|After hearing the song Yellow numerous times on the radio, I felt compelled to purchase this album. I definately wasn't expecting a hard rock album, though I definately wasn't expecting something as mellow as Parachutes. There is really nothing exceptional I can say about this album. When you're hearing the same monotone songs over and over again it's hard to pick out any one thing. However, there is something about this CD that grabbed me. All of the songs are gorgeous and the production is solid. I do not think that this is a great album, but it's certainly better than most of the [stuff] out there today.
B00000163G|5.0|THIS CD IS A MASTERPIECE, CLASSIC, MUST HAVE DOUBLE CD EVER. ONE OF MY FAVORITES. NOW BECOMING RARE, IT IS A MUST HAVE ALBUM. AFTER MAY 1, 2001 (WHEN IT IS RE RELEASED) IT WILL BE HARD TO FIND AFTERWARDS. MUST HAVE IT. IT IS A GREAT TUPAC ALBUM EVER.
0375501851|4.0|I really enjoyed white teeth by Zadie Smith. Not only is it wise, and well written, it is incredibly witty. To me, the story seems to be about the absurdity of humankind. It doesn't really matter which part of the world a person may come from, everyone is struggling to make sense of it all in their own inimitable way. She has a sagacity way beyond her years: the characters are real and human. It was easy to read the five hundred pages or so, because I was so curious as to what would happen next.  It makes a refreshing change to read an energetic book by a young woman that is not introspective nonsense  on `how to catch a man', but instead intelligently consolidates life experiences and complex issues in to an altogether more expansive view of the way people think today. This takes tremendous talent. I hope this paves the way for broader perspectives from 20 and 30 something authors. The book is chaotic, fun and vital and is very much London (or perhaps any other cosmopolitan city) today. I read the paperback version which I bought from Amazon.co.uk (if I'm permitted to say that), and so can only hope that the US version has not changed too much of the quintessential London everyday language into Americanisms. Zadie Smith has a great understanding of dialogue, that she could so easily be a playwright. Perhaps because I grew up in London, of a mixed race family, I can understand much of what she says. I had to chuckle to myself when on public transport, despite the strange looks I received on the T.  The book is topical and even touches upon scientific patenting, which was intriguing. There are many people in the UK and US who have very limited experience (if any) of non-whiteness, and those people who feel uncomfortable with such multicultural images should not read this. I, however, loved this book and eagerly look forward to her next novel.
B000023VR6|5.0|THE BEST OF DRE SINCE 1992. WITH HIS UN SUCCESSFUL AFTERMATH ALBUM THIS WAS A HUGE COMBACK FOR THE RAP PIONEER. WITH OTHER ALBUMS LIKE CONCRETE ROOTS OR COMPILATIONS LIKE THE FIRM DRE WAS NOT AT HIS BEST. BUY IT.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Woody, Buzz, Slinky and the rest of the Toy Story gang have returned in Toy Story 2.  This time Woody gets kidnapped and meets characters from his past which he had forgotten about and now must come to grips and choose between the friends from his past and those he has now.<br />Buzz and some of the rest of the gang come to Woody's resue.<br />This is the best movie sequel that I have seen in a long time.  The animation surpasses that of Toy Story and the story line is fantastic.

0792833201|5.0|Hey I saw this movie for the first time ever in the theaters when I was 7 years old, and this movie scared the heck out of me (to put it nicely).  I hated this movie between that and when it hit cable, then I increasingly got not-scared of it.  I just recently purchased this DVD and watched it for the first time in 12 years and to be honest, when you take the spooky and gross out stuff out of it, it's a heartwarming movie.  Plus for me it reminds me of life growing up in the early 80s, since both young kids (Carol Anne and Robbie) are around what my age was then. Based on first hand experience, please do not show this movie to your kid if he's that young.  I went after begging my mom to take me there. LOL Robbie (Oliver Robbins) is a boy who has possibly two of any 8-year-old kid's worst nightmares come true; a tree (or any object that looks mean) coming to life to take him away, and a clown who comes to life to attack him. Carol-Anne (the late Heather O'Rourke) ends up in another void, and her mom finally goes in to get her, to put it simply. There's everything for you in this movie, and if you're old enough, it won't scare you THAT much.
B000005Z0E|4.0|THIS CD IS A GOOD TUPAC ALBUM. IT IS HIS DEPUT CD. IT IS A CD TO GET AND KEEP. CLASSIC, AND ONCE WAS TRIED TO BE BANNED FROM STORES. ITS GOOD. BUY IT.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I am always to the point. My point is you can listen to this whole album without fast forwarding. It is very mellow and laid back. It has all her hits, and thats why its the best of Sade!
B00005B3Z6|5.0|A group of friends and I have made our Sunday nights a gathering for dinner and the US (slash Canadian) version of Queer as Folk. I had to see what the British original was like. Having seen them both now, I couldn't say which I prefer. There are aspects of character development in the US version that are more fully rounded. But the shorter &quot;arc&quot; of the British version makes it more focused and intense. The development of the Stuart (Brian) character is done better in the British series. There were times when I was laughing out loud and times when I was moved to tears. I recommend both and each for their unique take on a group of characters that I've come to love whatever their nationality. Manchester, Pittsburg or Toronto: Go Queers!
079073639X|1.0|This movie is just plain old bad -- no logical plot, and derivative and stupid subplots (Samuel L. Jackson going whacko is a straight ripoff from another movie) designed to distract you from realizing there IS NO plot, etc.  The only fun thing was the airplane cockpit, but it was gone in 60 seconds.... There are some fun &quot;C&quot; movies -- this isn't one of them!
0671027344|3.0|Yes, for all that people say, it is a good book. The material is interesting and feeds all the readers needs of gossipy taboo's and nostalgic memories one may have of his/her teen years.  I feel that Chbosky over dramatized the lives in the book, trying to fit in as many twists as possible to make the characters more intriguing.  However, his ability to puzzle together as many situations and themes into one 213 page book is quite remarkable.  Somehow it all fits.  To be able to enjoy this book, you need to be able to let loose and just flow wherever the book takes you.  It is an exciting ride that is nothing new.  Just another tale of teenage crisis: kid goes through changes to reveal truths of the world.
6303686796|5.0|Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece written by Paul Schrader to me is the ultimate film about loneliness and insanity. Two things that Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) obviously is. The movies starts out with Travis going to a cab company for a job. The reason is he can't sleep at nights. At his job he meets a lot of odd people in his cab. But, he also meets his share when off work too. Like fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle) whom at one point Travis tries confiding in. He really is loney and has no one to be with. All he does is drive his cab, untill, one day he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). She's working on political campaign for some politician. At first she thinks he's &quot;creepy&quot;. Tom (Albert Brooks) has I would say a crush on her. At first he tries to &quot;defend&quot; her against him. After the two go out for a brief time. She becomes digusted with him after he tries to take her to go see an adult movie. At this point the insanity kicks in. He now starts to talk about how the streets of New York make him sick. Everyone is &quot;scum&quot;. He can't breathe the air. In an effort to &quot;free&quot; himself, he decides to &quot;save&quot; a very young prositute Iris (Jodie Foster). The problem first of all is, she doesn't think she needs to be saved. She thinks things are going ok. Secondly, her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) says he loves her. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; hits so many right spots to keep our interest. It has so many powerful moments. The acting by De Niro is truly a standout. His Oscar nomination was rightfully deserved. We see this transformation in his character, and to me, it's spellbounding. His &quot;our you looking at me&quot; speech has to be one of the most OVER quoted lines in film history, it's right up there with &quot;What am I a clown? Am I here to amuse you?&quot;. Scorsese is a director of considerable outstanding talents and this film allows him to showcase it very well. He also has a small cameo as a jealous husband who is spying on his wife, who is cheating on him. The movie was up for 4 Academy Awards; &quot;Best Picture&quot;, &quot;Best Actor&quot;, &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; (Jodie Foster), and &quot;Best Musical Score&quot;.on his wife, who is cheating on him. The movie was up for 4 Academy Awards; &quot;Best Picture&quot;, &quot;Best Actor&quot;, &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; (Jodie Foster), and &quot;Best Musical Score&quot;.
0066620694|4.0|I read this book for my e-commerce (MBA) class at San Jose State University (Silicon Valley). I was primarily attracted by its title at first, which is nothing surprising as it was chosen from a given list. The fact that it was obviously dealing with innovations made this attractive, as I work in the Silicon Valley, where innovations and new technology is rampant and is the main source of success of a company. This book looks at a variety of companies in industries from the disk drive to the Mechanical excavator in the past couple of decades, and why they have become leaders or failures.  The author explains the reasoning behind the failures and how one can reduce this problem. Some of the key approaches are the fact that every company, product, market , time should be dealt in a situational manner. It is not wise to simply apply textbook information to a business, this is a sure guide to failure. A strong attribute to success, according to the author, is by focusing on disruptive technologies as opposed to sustaining technologies. Disruptive technology, being radical new products where no customers expressed needs for. Meanwhile sustaining technologies consist of improvements on existing products, that originate primarily from what customers have expressed they would like to see. It is more common to find small companies creating disruptive technologies, as unlike big companies they are in search of any kind of market even a small one, and are more risk taking. This book, one will find, is easy to read, and straight forward. I would say that it is a good guide for aspiring, or existing managers who need to see the light!
B000056NX4|5.0|I saw this before seeing the 1973 Norman Jewison version and so I won't comment on that film here.  (If you like, you can see my review at the other Amazon page where I do make comparisons.)  This was in fact my first experience with Jesus Christ, Superstar, and I must say I was delighted, especially with the acting and the music.  Surely this is a different production than that which ran in London and on Broadway since Directors Gale Edwards and Nick Morris use close ups of the actors' faces to great advantage, something not possible on the stage.  Lost to the viewer, I suspect, might be the full range of movement and choreography.  Not lost is the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, in particular the title song and the haunting, ironic ballad, &quot;I don't know how to love him.&quot;  When Mary Magdalene in the person of the velvety Renee Castle breaks into song our spirit is roused and our understanding of one of the ironies of Christianity heightened.  The lyric, &quot;He's only a man, and I've had so many men before...&quot; somehow brings to life the enigma that Jesus, God in the flesh, is to all of us.<br />I recall when JCS was first performed a controversy arose about whether it was sacrilegious.  I don't know how that controversy played out, but I can see how some might be offended.  (Of course, I was not.)  This production, while not directly sensuous does depict a very human Jesus, clad in one scene only in a very scanty loincloth.  There is an emphasis on the blood that he shed, wiped from him onto the hands of us all, or, as some have complained, onto the hands of the Jews, who have been getting the bad rap for two thousand years.  And there is the question, first of all of making Jesus into a political &quot;superstar.&quot;  Yet, that too is irony, a dramatic irony that is a truth.  He is a superstar in this country and has been for a long time.  Whether he is also the son of God is another matter.  That is partially the point of this musical.  The fact that it is played out in a contemporary milieu really adds to its universal power since it is conceivable that such a religious transformation could happen here.<br />One does wonder however about some of the costuming.  Why are the Romans in Nazi uniforms, recalling an earlier era, and why is Judas in a leather jacket, looking a little like Marlon Brando from The Wild One (1954) or perhaps John Travolta from Grease (1978)?  Perhaps what is suggested is a broader time era, say the entire mid twentieth century.<br />I found myself comparing this to some other filmed musicals that arose during that same era, the sixties and seventies, West Side Story, Grease, and Hair, musicals that in some sense seemed to break with the pleasant tradition long established with, for example, Where's Charlie?, South Pacific, Oklahoma, etc.  In a sense these newer productions seemed out to shock the bourgeoisie as well as to entertain the burghers, to widen the parameters of the London/New York musical comedy tradition and to call on the audience to think.  Indeed some imagined that a revolution was in the making.  JCS in particular seemed to threaten the religious orthodoxy.  In retrospect, however, Hair seems more dated than shocking and West Side Story and Grease totally within the tradition of My Fair Lady and Damn Yankees.  Jesus Christ, Superstar now thirty years later also seems totally within that venerable tradition.<br />Glenn Carter as Jesus was very good.  His combination of strength and vulnerability suited well the conception of a Jesus who believed he was sent to earth to die for our sins, a persona half God and half man.  True he seemed to lack somewhat in charisma, but in attempting such a part, who wouldn't?  J&eacute;rôme Pradon as Judas also was excellent in a nicely balanced characterization.  When he too laments that he didn't &quot;know how to love him&quot; we know the truth of the very human trap he made for himself (although properly speaking, he was God's instrument).  Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene was expressive and sung beautifully; indeed she seemed the very embodiment of a woman in love with a man she cannot possess.  However there was something lacking not in her performance, but in the very conception of the part.  I felt the need for some rags and dirt and some real destitution.  Perhaps Mary Magdalene here is too sanitized, too pretty, too clean and too well behaved to be the real Mary Magdalene.<br />My only real disappointment with this engrossing and thought-provoking entertainment was in not seeing a glorious resurrection of Jesus.  But in retrospect, I realize that would have detracted from the Rice/Webber conception of &quot;a man, like any other man.&quot;  I think they make a powerful point, because in the deepest religious sense, at least to my mind, we and Christ really are brothers, the immaculate made flesh.nt).

B00003CWN3|5.0|Odd cinematography, but appropriately chosen.  Boys Don't Cry has a feel to it you know stirs inside a part of you that is very afraid...very buried and doesn't want to surface.  The movie is a true story with the creepiest elements of over-entitled male mentality, along with social biases against a girl who so strongly feels invested in being the opposite gender.  The movie is first and foremost, a poignant love story...and then a case against society for their close-minded and sick fears about when someone doesn't fit in the box made for him or her.  The movie can at times be gruesome and if you're in touch with yourself at all, it will take a lot of energy out of you.
B000002OR4|5.0|I chose to do my Year 9 history Project on the Holocaust because I knew nix about it and it seemed so much more significant than 'Fashion in the war', so I did all the research and stuff and then noticed the film schindler's list was goin to be on tele and thought 'chance to a bit of back-side research, get the feel of it'<br />The movie totally blew me away and the music was the icing on the haunting cake that was schindler's list. I was so glad I watched it and rushed to the computer to find some of the music and download it!!!!! I think my mum was a little surprised when the cd turned up on the doormat a few weeks later (I'm more of a rap/rock person) but now I can sit back and imagine myself playin that violin theme music myself. ( I've been playin since I was 8 (Now ...) but i'm still not quite good enough)<br />oh well. dream on AND BUY THIS CD If you only buy one remotely 'classical' cd..make it this one and that stuff. Words cannot really describe it.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Finally a CD with songs that can rock and still have lyrics that go somewhere.  I have recently become a CREED fan and like some of the newer stuff, but when you boil it down, it all really sounds alike, very cookier cutter sameness.  Then along comes Journey, with a new lead singer, after the whiney TBF CD.  Now way will this fly......WRONG!  This cd is the best product they have provided since ESCAPE.  The songs on this CD have heart, soul, great musical depth, and wonderful lyrics.  &quot;Signs of Life&quot; could have been on the ESCAPE albumn.  Augeri's vocals sound a lot like Perry but definately has his own style as well.  A kind of mix between the voice of Perry and Rod Stewart.  Schon has not lost a thing on guitar and the new drummer rocks!  If you want a preview of the sound, check out the free concert on DSS.  You too will be a believer.  I guess I never should have &quot;stopped believin&quot;.
B000056K04|5.0|As a first time listener, I have to disagree with the many negative reviews given about the album.  The talent of the five musicians is incredible, and the instrumentation, combined with the songwriting of Dave Matthews, makes for a very complete album.  Though Dave's voice is detracting at times, his vocal ablities add a lot, especially to the slower songs on the album, which I found very inspired and heartfelt.  I especially enjoy the violin parts, which really give more depth to the songs in which Boyd Tinsley plays.  The album is not as mellow as many make it out to be either, with plenty of electric guitar and bits of groove, accented by the excellent drumming of Carter Beauford.

B000001ESJ|5.0|I love this album, it is unbelievable. While many people choose, &quot;2112&quot;, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;,and &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, as their favorites, (as I think those were good albums also), this is the one that stands above the rest in my book. This album probably dosen't get as much recognition by the critics, I don't understand why, but what the hell do they know, the fans know the real deal. <br />This album starts off with the title track, which starts off with classical guitar, then turns into a rocker. &quot;Xanadu&quot;, is my second favorite epic by this talented band, as it is 11-minutes long and beautiful. I'm quite sure everyone knows &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot;. &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, is also great with acoustic and electric guitar parts. &quot;Madrigal&quot;, is soft and beautiful. &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot;, oh my god!. This is my absolute favorite on the album. At first, I hated it, but then it totally grew on me. Now it is my #1 favorite Rush epic. The others are good, but to me Rush didn't surpass what they accomplished on this truly dark, heavy and insane epic. This is truly a hard song to play as I've only learned to play some of it.(the ending of the 1st movement in something of a 9/4 time, I think. Any guitarists out there like myself, try the Eb minor, C minor barre chords based in A, to F# barre chord based in E. Play it and see if it sounds familiar to you.) Sorry for rambling but an album like this is worth it. By the way my favorite part of the epic is the 3rd movement as it starts off in what I believe is something of an 11/8, and the key of E is repeated into submisson. <br />Alright I'm done with my rambling, I'm sorry if I bored anyone, but this album is truly amazing and shame on the idiots who didin't give this album the justice it deserves.<br />Definitely, my favorite Rush album!<br />Thanks
B000005ILF|3.0|Nothing against this album but, as I said in the title, I think it lacks the edge, the punch, if you will, of previous albums.  This release, as some have already observed, more introspective and soulful and I can't say I'm as much of a fan of that stuff.  The first two songs are potential classics.  I also particularly like &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Regrets&quot; and &quot;Lithium Sunset&quot; but after only two listens thus far, not much of the rest of the album grabs me.  &quot;I'm So Happy...&quot; almost made it, but I felt the chorus was repeated too often.  Don't know if that makes any sense but I think it spoils an otherwise good song.
B00003CWMI|5.0|I had read the reviews of this movie when it came out into theatres, actually more of my dad bashing it really, which between the two caused me not to see it.  I was home sick one day and I happened to stumble on to this movie on STARZ!  What I saw wasn't just a movie, it was a masterpiece.  Every aspect of the movie was done to perfection.  The acting, the directing, the music, it goes on and on.  Not since The Last of the Mohicans have I seen a movie do this.  The movie itself did something that only the movie Brian's Song has made me do... Put me into tears.  If you do not cry at some point in this movie, you may just not have a heart.  You can thank the great acting by Robin Williams and relative unknown Embeth Davidtz and the music by James Horner for doing this to me.  I especially enjoyed Davidtz.  Why this was her first &quot;Big time&quot; movie I do not know.  Williams and Horner as usual performed to thier potential.  Another thing well done in this movie was the special effects.  It's a rarity today to see a movie with special effects that actually has a plot.  In the end, you must see this movie.  If the Academy just didn't pick their best picture nominees according to highest gross and public opinion, I truly feel this would have been in contention.  After you see this movie, tell me if Gladiator was better than this.
0385486804|2.0|I was left with mixed feelings after completing Into The Wild.  On the positive side, Jon Krakauer did some great detective work to piece together what happened to Chris McCandless.  I was impressed by how he was able to track down so many of the people who encountered Chris, and even how he was able to make plausible conjectures about what eventually caused his death.<br />What bothers me about the book is Krakauer's portrayal of McCandless as an &quot;everyman&quot; who was trying find himself by being immersed in nature.  While it's true that many young people go through a period where they embark on soul-searching odysseys, there's a difference between taking a summer off to drive around the USA and what McCandless did, which was to completely isolate himself from his family, and then to venture into the Alaskan wilderness without the expected necessities.  I also was unimpressed by Krakauer's comparison of McCandless to his own youthful experiences.  That part of the book seemed like an unnecessary aside.<br />As a whole, this fairly short book was probably better off as a long magazine article (which it originally was).  If you take out Krakauer's own introspection, as well as many reptitive passages, it probably can be condensed to under 100 pages.<br />One other note - for those who have read Into Thin Air, I found Krakauer's views different in the 2 books.  In Into Thin Air, Krakauer comes off as cricial of the people who unnecessarily risked themselves and others while trying to climb Mt. Everest.  In Into The Wild, Krakauer instead seems to praise McCandless for his journey into Alaska, even though his lack of preparation (e.g. no maps, no compass) eventually led to his downfall.  Is it possible that Krakauer's views changed after his own personal experience on Everest?
0553213105|5.0|When I was a young teen, a freind of my mother's had the 6 volume BBC movie version of this novel, but we never saw all of the episodes.  Now, I am twenty, and I only wonder why I waited so long to read it.  There were truly moments when I wanted to scream, laugh, and heave a sigh from the core of my innards.  The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience.  I recommend to all women, and all sensitive men.  Also, women who come from families with all sisters will have a strong nostalgic reation (I sure did.)
0425170349|3.0|Overall I generally enjoyed this book.  Anytime I had a chance to read it I did.  However, this book does not stand up to the wonderful writing of his previous books.  In general I feel this book suffers from two things.  First, the egomaniac/eco-terrorist/billionaire criminal is clich&eacute;d at best and uninteresting at worst.  The plot seemed formulaic at times and lacked any real credibility as a real threat to the world (Olympic Security Contract- the need to raise terrorism around the globe to force the hand of the Olympic Committee).  Another issue is the \\"tree-hugger\\" as terrorist.  This at best seems a little comic book-like and I found myself wishing for a more ruthless criminal.  Regardless of whether I liked the character or his motivations, it just seemed that Clancy wasn't able to make me sympathize with him.  And I especially felt the story was more than anticlimactic with the ending.<br />The second problem I had with the book was the length.  Although I enjoyed the variety of ongoing storylines, I did find myself becoming anxious to move on about 3/4 the way through.  This may be an example of an overwritten novel that fails to deliver on the extra words.<br />Again, I generally like this book and I'm glad I read it.  I would recommend that anyone picking this novel be prepared for a less than stellar writing performance from Clancy but one that still engages the reader at times and builds anxiety, etc. in the storyline and character development.  I would also be dishonest if I didn't think this book could be weaved into an interesting screenplay with characters like Clark.
B00005B3Z5|5.0|The British &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; is witty, intelligent, well-written, well-acted, and incredibly entertaining. The American version is dumbed down; the punchlines sound like they belong on a sitcom, and the creators seem intent on hitting us over the head rather than observing. Where the American version particularly suffers is in the character of Brian. Stuart in the British version (played by Aidan Gillen) has such presence and vitality that it's impossible not to watch him. His charisma makes him likeable; we can root for him despite his smug self-confidence. Brian, by comparison, is a piece of dead wood that just walked out of GQ. I just wanted him to go away. The American version also uses flashy &quot;MTV-style&quot; editing in a effort to look cool, I guess, but it's really just annoying.<br />I could go on, but you get the idea. Watch the British version. (And as for the person who wrote that the Brits don't have it in the looks department...you don't know what you're talking about.)
158234082X|4.0|It's a fun book to read, but Bourdain would have benefited greatly by a good editor.  He refers often to his drug habits, and then -poof!- they're gone.  After devoting several chapters to the strange degenerate life he and fellow cooks lead, the last chapters recognize that there is a more conventional side to a chef's life; Bourdain just chose not to take that route for reasons he never tells us.  The flow of the book is rather choppy and doesn't hang together as a neat tale.<br />All that criticism aside, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the experiences Bourdain relates, and his colorful way of telling his story.  Although he lead a seamy life, sometimes I wish I could have hung out with him for a while.  Don't tell my kids.
B000002L9J|5.0|certainly the best pop album of the 80s and a contender for any nick hornby-worthy &quot;best ever&quot; top-ten list.  morrissey's sad-sack sardonic lyrics prove the perfect foil for the jangly-pop guitar licks of lead strummer johnny marr; easily one of the most effective pop pairings in music history.  that being said, there are some mediocre tracks on this album: frankly, i never cared for &quot;frankly, mr. shankly&quot; (see &quot;paint a vuglar picture&quot; for a more clever spin on fame-seekers and the corruption of art through industry) or the flippant &quot;vicar in a tutu.&quot; but even these can't overshadow such classics as &quot;boy with a thorn in his side,&quot; &quot;the queen is dead,&quot; &quot;cemetary gates,&quot; &quot;there is a light...&quot; and &quot;bigmouth strikes again&quot;--a string of gems that make this the band's greatest studio album.  <br />if you dig the smiths you might also like other uk imports belle and sebastian and suede.
B0000024JN|5.0|The Beastie Boy's Licensed to Ill is a classic rap album that stands the test of time.  All the songs are well crafted and the use of sampling works to the album's advantage.  Some of my favorite are Paul Revere, Slow and Low and Posse in Effect.  Every song is filled with catchy hooks and witty lyrics.  This album is an essential for any die-hard music fan of any age. This piece is best listened to in the context of the whole album, as the songs run together, (in similar fasion to the Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band).  Bravo Beastie Boys... you have created the perfect head-bobbing album.  Anyone even interested in the Beastie Boys needs this piece of music!
0385121679|4.0|I am a big Stephen King fan, and I read most of his work. Of everything I have read such far, I enjoyed &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot; the best, but had a tough decision deciding whether or not &quot;The Shining&quot; was better...in the end, &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot; received five stars, and &quot;The Shining&quot; four...here's why:<br />I read &quot;The Shining&quot; in three days. It was a quick read for me, mainly because I got into the story and it never let up. I did the same with &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;, but I found that throughout this book, it got slightly annoying when paragraphs were suddenly broken with thoughts, then continued...I had to go back to remember what they were talking about before the break occurred. This, for me, slowed the pace, but I eventually didn't mind as the book went on. <br />&quot;The Shining&quot; was filled with believable characters that I could get to know. Jack really seemed like an alcoholic when he got angry, but you could also the good side to him...I wasn't sure whether I wanted to hate him or like him. That caused a lot of conflict that I enjoyed. As for Wendy and Danny, I felt connected with him. Though I am 15 years old, I can remember being five, thinking things like, &quot;It's not a sweet, it's a suite.&quot; <br />King wrote this book beautifully, and I can see why it is such a classic. This is easily one of the best books I have ever read, and I will never forget it...but maybe being so popular has taken away from it. Before even starting, I knew that REDRUM was MURDER, so that took away some of the shock when it was finally revealed. <br />&quot;The Shining&quot; is truly a great book that you must read. I loved it, and will eventually reread it one day...I can't say enough about it. But there were only a few things that took away from it...I already knew a lot about it before I started, whereas with other books, it was a shock. If you liked &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;, you will love &quot;The Shining&quot;. Personally,I don't feel the ending was a letdown...I enjoyed it and felt satisfied. Read this book. That's all I can say!!! (It's the best Easter present I've ever gotten!)
B0000524CY|4.0|Some of my girlfriends and I rented this movie for a sleepover I was having at my house. It was Friday the 13th and we watched it in my basement at 11:30 so we figured we would be scared out of our mind. I liked it because it was a classic horror movie but I guess after seeing all this new-age horror movies with all the real life graphics, The Exorcist wasnt that scary. The only thing that creeped me out was the way the girl looked when she was possesed. But dont get me wrong, I think everyone should see it atleast once.
0671027344|5.0|After reading the book &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower,&quot; I thought about a lot of things.  Especially about how the book relates to my life as a teenager.  I thought about how some of the things Charlie does relate to what I like, and do.  I loved how it was so easy for you to relate to the characters in the story.  What was great about the book is that the author either remembers his high school experience vividly, or did a lot of research becuase, he writes just like it is.  I also loved the different format, and how all of the pages are in letter form.  I think that this way made the story that much more interesting.  He also showed many good examples of how a &quot;difunctional&quot; family may act.  I think that all in all the book was great, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000001FMC|5.0|Yeah, it came out nearly 15 years ago, and the English group has been super-popular in Japan (rather than the U.S.), but the album still has replayability in the new millennium.  Some may think this music isn't their cup of tea, but to tell the truth, everyone will like at least one song on this album.  They kinda touch upon several genres, from pop to jazz. &quot;It's Better To Travel&quot; broke Swing Out Sister into the U.S. They're the group that you would hear on the radio and think &quot;Man, that's a catchy song. I wonder who made that.&quot; And you would never realize that all those catchy songs you've heard were made by S.O.S.. And it all started with &quot;It's Better To Travel.&quot; In fact, one of the greatest songs of all-time (and I may get flack for this) is &quot;Twilight World.&quot; I don't think there's anyone who grew up in the 80's who didn't like that song. The horns and violins are captivating, and Corrine Drewery's english accent makes the song even more interesting.  My favorite ones are hard &quot;Breakout&quot;, &quot;Twilight World&quot;, &quot;After Hours&quot;, &quot;Fooled By A Smile&quot;, and &quot;Surrender&quot;.  All equally melodic songs that you never get tired of.  Corrine Drewery and Andy Connell truly didn't know how to make a bad song...
0380788624|5.0|I'm about to read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  From reading these reviews, it seems to me that one of my favorite novels of all time would appeal to the same people who like this book.  That would be Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace.  It doesn't have the geek factor that Cryptonomicon apparently has, but it has a zillion interweaving stories and digressions within digressions and it's funny as hell.  Give it a try!
0380778556|5.0|A young, naive woman who is the paid companion of an obnoxious rich woman is taken along to Monte Carlo. While she smarts under the rudeness and gauche behavior of her employer, she meets the dark, handsome widower Max de Winter.<br />What follows is a love story and a ghost story of a woman haunted by the powerful presence of the former mistress of Manderley.  We never learn the name of the heroine as she marries Max, moves into the rigid but elegant life at Manderley and tangles with Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's fearsome housekeeper. What unfolds is not only a mystery but a story of obsessions and evil. The end is a shock.<br />Du Maurier created an unforgettable atmosphere of decaying beauty, frightening spirits and horror mixed with love and death. If you haven't read this, I am envious. You get to experience it for the first time.
B00004RHZU|4.0|This girl has got some mad skills when it comes to singing. Shes got a voice on her and she knows how to use it. especially on stop falling becuase she straight screams in that song during the end. My favorite song though is there you go, that was my favorite song last year and my jam this year too
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is a great movie. Just ... because you are used to mindless films doesnt make it a bad movie. On any stand poit, critic and movie go-er, this movie rocks, honestly. DONT LISTEN TO ANY BAD REVIEWS, THEY ARE ALL PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. BUY THIS MOVIE.
0345409671|2.0|I liked the book just fine but it ruined lestats whole image He's supposed to be a strong blood sucker that has very few feelings'but toward the end of the book he gets just as soft as louis. Anne Rice Really needs to write a book that reinstates his image.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was such an amazing book to read, especially as an adolescent.  Being able to understand and sympathize with Charlie was a wonderful experience. It was so interesting to see his character change as people entered or left his life. The way the author portrayed the charachters and situations involving Charlie was incredible.  He made everything seem so real, and that just made the book that much better.  This was not another one of those sad teenage sob books where the main charachter deals with drugs and sex, but a story where reall life things actually occur.  Being able to relate with Charlie and the situations he was faced with made reading this book an incredible experience.
1572522232|4.0|Ive read nearly every review on the internet for this film (i was THAT excited about seeing it!!)and it seems theres a lot of people who are PRETENDING to have seen this!!People are calling this 'the most terrifying movie ever' etc.I mean these people really need to relax.Its a great film but definitely not the scariest ive seen.The first ten minutes though are,not breathtaking,but really good.Theres enough suspence in these opening ten minutes than anything of late youve seen.I wasnt expecting much of a plot after reading others reviews and i wasnt dissapointed.The beautiful camera work and set design make up for it though.This is not a great horror film,its a great film.PERIOD.The thing i like about this one though is the fact that you can watch it time and time again and get something new out of it.I`m not sure if its just me or weather you really are not sure if its really happening,if shes dreaming or if shes developing an extreme psychotic state.The best example of this is a scene when she kills a bat in her room(!!) with a chair and the very next scene shes sat on her bed calmly smoking a cigarette as though nothing happened.Theres so much going on here,it really is well directed.You can get quite disorientated trying to work out whats going on!!A great film but dont believe them 'scariest film ever' reviews from them anxious,nervous induviduals!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I went out and saw the movie. Right after, my friend asked what I thought. The first thing I said was &quot;I've got to have that soundtrack!&quot; The songs are the best I've heard. Starting from Po' Lazarus, then on to songs like You Are my Sunshine to the beautiful great combo of Gillian Welsch, Allison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris singing &quot;Nobody but the Baby.&quot; You not only re-live the movie, but you also find yourself singing along to words you've only heard once. It's quite uplifting (though it is the depression era) at points and just ahhhh I can't even stress enough how good this cd is!  It's so good that I had two people borrow it and one person steal it!!  It's just so different from what we are subjected to everyday over the radio (and don't get me wrong, I am your typical twenty year old). It's nice to listen to songs without someone thumping a heavy techno beat or screaming every few seconds. I would rather give this cd 10 stars than just five. It totally made the movie (though George Clooney wasn't bad!)
0385335482|4.0|I LOVED this book. Happened to pick it up on a whim and was delightfully surprised. I could not put the book down. I laughed OUT LOUD on a five hour flight full of business types. I was quite embarassed but could not- would not put the book down. I rushed to pass the book on to my family, collect it and pass it on again so that everyone could enjoy Becky's antics.
B000059ZT4|4.0|Universal Music, the mega-company that seems to have eaten and digested dozens of other labels, has issued an expanded and remastered versions of the landmark reggae album &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; by the Wailers.  While the music has never sounded better, there are some significant and fundamental problems with this release.<br />  Except perhaps for the soundtrack album to the film &quot;The Harder They Come,&quot; the Wailers' &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; (1973) was the first reggae album that most listeners outside of Jamaica ever heard. The group had been together in some form for a decade and had enjoyed a long series of Jamaican hit singles.  They had also moved easily from r&amp;b to ska before becoming one of the earliest reggae acts.  Although Bob Marley wrote and sang most of the songs, it was by no means his band.  Peter Tosh also was a major contributor, and Marley, Tosh and Bunny Livingston (a/k/a Bunny Wailer) had been bandmates from the beginning, and their vocal blend was striking and beautiful.<br />  Island Records' founder and president Chris Blackwell had long followed the Jamaican music scene.  When he heard the powerful results of the Wailers' '72 sessions he was ready to spring reggae on the rest of the world.  Between this decision and the music's actual release, though, Blackwell got cold feet, and altered most of the tracks in London by judiciously and tastefully overdubbing rock keyboards, guitar and backing vocals in an apparent attempt to make the tracks more accessible to rock-oriented listeners.  Whether these alterations were necessary, or even a good idea, &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; found an audience in England, the U.S. and elsewhere and became a modest hit.  Although the original band broke up a year or so (and one album) later when Tosh and Livingston left, Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers were on their way to international stardom.<br />  &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; (Deluxe Edition) makes available for the first time the original unadulterated recordings from the 1972 sessions, and they are really a revelation.  These versions are rawer but more powerful; its as if a sonic gauze has been removed, revealing the true nature of the music for the first time.  These tracks have an immediacy that was lacking in the originally released versions, and long-time fans of Marley and the Wailers will feel as if they've stumbled upon the Holy Grail of reggae.  There are also two previously unreleased songs that fans will find worth hearing and owning.<br />  The remastered version of the original album, overdubs and all, is also here and sounds better than ever.  Such Marley classics as &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot; still retain their appeal.  Its worth noting, though, that two of the album's most powerful songs, &quot;400 Years&quot; and &quot;Stop That Train,&quot; are written and sung by Peter Tosh.  Tosh was one of reggae's greatest artists, and its a shame that his reputation seems diminished largely because he was so overshadowed by bandmate Marley.<br />  The major problem with this release, and one that may make you think twice about purchasing it, is that there is barely eighty minutes of music on this two-disk set, which sells for the full price of two CDs.  The Wailers recorded extensively in the period before &quot;Catch A Fire,&quot; and perhaps some of those tracks (many of which are excellent) could have been licensed by Universal for inclusion here.  Another option would have been dropping one of the two outtakes and fitting it all on one disk.  Serious fans of Marley and the Wailers will purchase this package without a second thought, but more casual fans might do better to seek out the earlier, budget-priced CD issue of &quot;Catch A Fire.&quot;  The booklet of the Deluxe Edition includes all the original artwork and some nice and rare photos, as well as song lyrics, but the essay is second-rate and disappointing.<br />  In the last few months Universal has issued such classics as &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot; in similar &quot;Deluxe Editions&quot; at a premium price.  While there was a  significant amount of previously unheard material in those two releases to justify their purchase, the paucity of new music here makes this feel like a bit of a rip-off.  Its too bad, because &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; is a classic that deserves better treatment.issued such classics as &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot; in similar &quot;Deluxe Editions&quot; at a premium price.

B000002U82|5.0|Let me declare my old age right up front.  I'm pushin' fifty, and I recall buying &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; when it orginally came out.  Needless to say I was totally blown away!<br />I also recall all the hype and fawning reviews surrounding the Beatles' &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; album.  Everybody was praising it for being the &quot;best concept album ever,&quot; etc., etc.  Of course, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was a great album.  In fact, when &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was being recorded in early 1967, another English band (guess who?) was recording its first album at Abbey Road studios.  Coincidence? When I first heard &quot;Pepper&quot; I enjoyed it, but felt that it didn't  hold together as a &quot;concept&quot; album.  Several songs seemed out of place.<br />Anyway, when I first heard &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; I was impressed by the cohesion of it.  The songs blended together, one right after another, so seamlessly. Overall, I think it's a much better album than &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; and I'll go out on a limb and call it the best concept album ever recorded by a rock group.  It sounds like what the Beatles attempted to do with &quot;Pepper,&quot; but couldn't pull off.  <br />&quot;Dark Side&quot; is more cohesive than &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; or any of Floyd's later recordings, including the dreary, pretentious &quot;The Wall.&quot;  I don't think Floyd ever recorded a better, more enjoyable album.  It sounds as fresh and innovative today as it did in 1973.
B00004SWBD|3.0|This CD is okay.  I was expecting more.  To be precise, I expected there to be no cussing and I assumed the &quot;Explicit Lyrics&quot; thing at the top of this page was a typo.  After all, there isn't any PA sticker shown on the picture of the cover, right?  Well, I bought this CD and every cuss word is intact.  Don't ask me why this CD is called an edited version.  Maybe that is the typo.    Anyway, lyrics aside, the music is pretty good.  It starts off with a cool intro, kicks off with two loud metal tracks, softens up a bit for &quot;Wait and Bleed,&quot; and fires back up again with &quot;Surfacing.&quot;  It doesn't let up until track 7, then gets loud again for all the remaining tracks.  All the musicians are talented, but the guitar riffs and bass lines are pretty uncreative for the most part.    Over all, this is a good alternative metal/rap metal CD, but I wish I could find a clean version.  This wasn't it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is my favorite movie.  For years my favorite movie was Terry Gilliam's Brazil, but Fight Club has managed to remove it from the mantle and take it's place as what I consider to be the finest film ever made.<br />Not to quote the infamous line from the movie, but you truly cannot tell a person about Fight Club.  It's like The Matrix, it's a film better seen the first time knowing nothing about.  Even better if you go into it with misperceived notions of what the movie's about, so you can be proved wrong.<br />I think the only problem with the movie is that it was meant to be seen on the Big screen.  It uses certain camera tricks and techniques that were meant to enhance the theatrical experience.  I fear that anyone seeing this movie for the first time at home will not take from it everything that the theatrical experience provided.<br />So...for a proper viewing of this film...PLEASE follow the following rules:  1) be relaxed.  be ready and in the right state of mind to sit back and watch a long film.  It's NOT like watching &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, but it is an involved film that will require your patients and attention 2) remove all distraction.  Go to the bathroom, unplug the phone, and be settled to watch a great movie 3) turn off the lights, you'll like the movie a lot better in darkness...it's a very dark film and you'll need darkness to see everything 4) if you didn't like it...wait two weeks and watch it again.<br />For a movie review:  It is difficult to talk about the film without ruining it.  I first saw the preview for it when I went to see The Phantom Menace.  It was part of a Fox set of previews.  I saw a bunch of guys fighting and a bar of soap.  I thought, &quot;Is this like that lame Van Damme movie Lionheart?  No thanks.&quot;  In fact none of the previews made me want to see it.  Months later, after it's release, I heard a radio add for the film.  The add sparked a little interest in me because it involved the reading three scathing reviews by critics and one positive review.  I thought it was very ballsy of them to release those adds, but I still didn't go see the movie.<br />The next week I was away in upstate New York on a job interview.  I was flown there from California and had nothing to do on Thursday night in the tiny town that I was staying in.  They had an impressive movie theater, so I thought I'd unwind from my 10 hour interview by taking a film in.  When I arrived at the theater, Fight Club was just starting, so I bought a ticket on a whim (even though I really didn't like Lionheart very much).  I walked out of that film with my mind buzzing.  I had just enjoyed one of the most incredible theatrical experiences I had been through in a very long time.  As soon as I go back to San Diego I took three friends to see the movie.  I was so excited for them to see it and to hear their reaction.  I Needed someone to talk about the film with.  After the movie, and for the entire ride home in the car, no one said a word.  I thought to myself &quot;Oh no!  They hate me for making them see this movie.&quot;  Finally all three broke the silence and thanked me for taking them to one of the best movies they've ever seen.   I saw that movie 4 times in the theater, because I wanted all of my friends to see it.  Some loved it, some hated it, some didn't get it...but all were happy they saw it.<br />I don't want to give away any of the movie.  I'll just warn you that you'll like it or you'll hate it.  Either way, you should see it.  If you have no opinion about it...you need to learn to think a bit more critically about your world and the art that you see, because this is a film that you should have an opinion about.<br />As for the DVD, like the Seven DVD, David Fincher packs it full of goodies and commentaries that make it a worthwhile purchase.<br />Finally, you can make a great Trilogy if you watch three movies in this order.  First watch American Beauty, then Fight Club, and finally Office Space.  All three films have similar messages told in very different ways.  Watch Office Space last, because the first two films are so heavy, you might need a little comedy to lighten your mood.  Warning: watching these three films may make you quit your tedious job/life and go look for something more fulfilling in the world.

B00000FZ1V|5.0|Ghostbusters is a modern classic of a movie - it features an original premise, good special effects, and an A-List cast of great comedians. Seriously, we've got Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Ivan Reitman as director, and the beautiful Sigourney Weaver. What more could anyone ask for in a movie? The DVD version is definitely the best way to experience this movie, after all my years of inferior pan-and-scan cassettes taped off the television. Given that the film itself is 15-odd years old, the picture and sound quality aren't up to the heights of the Matrix and Gladiator DVD's, but they are far and above most reissues. Another problem that has plagued reissues of old movies have been the lack of extras. Movie trailers and production notes have become too common to be called extras anymore. Luckily, Columbia Pictures gave Ghostbusters the full treatment. Included is an audio-commentary featuring Reitman and Ramis, ten deleted scenes, concept sketches, behind-the-scenes programs, and so much more. The main menu is even nicely animated.<br />There is a lot more praise I could give this film, but what it comes down to simple: if at any one time in your life you liked Ghostbusters, then get this DVD. The movie is hilarious, the DVD is loaded. Too bad I can't say the same for the sequel...
0792839749|4.0|My main complaint about this DVD version is not the fact that it is a standard and not a letterbox format because I feel the quality of the picture as it is is very high and extremely pleasing. My complaint is that the quality of the soundtrack in comparison to mp3 version is quite inferior. The sound, including the base, is somewhat muddled, not fine and crisp at all. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this problem?

0920668372|5.0|Love you Forever was given to me when I first had my son. I cried half way through this childs book! Who ever thought a childs book could be that touching for adults? If you have a son, your love is expressed right through this book. A mother talks to her son when she sneakss in his room at night just to hold him and tell him she will always love him,and be there for him. As he gets older she does this often,even when the boy becomes a man. This may be comical to some but for all you mothers you will understand this and bond wit this book, as a mother bonds with her baby boy. In the end when the boy is a man he goes to his mother because she is old and tired, he holds and rocks her and repeats to her what she has told him all his life,about &quot;loving you forever&quot;,he goes home that night and shows the same unconditional love to his baby daughter. What a touching story for all ages.If only more writers could express a mothers true love for her child. Give this book to all the moms you know.What an excellent mothers day gift!
B000056K04|3.0|I just got this cd for Easter, and I'd been dying to get it because I'd heard it was good from a friend...I have to say, I wasn't overjoyed...I think a lot of the music on the cd seems to center more around Dave himself, more than anyone else in the band, which is a real shame because with all those extremely talented musicians (especially Boyd and Leroi) that you never find in other bands, they shouldn't be bumped into the background...I don't think that the cd's _bad_, it's just not as good as they could've done with their follow-up to Before These Crowded Streets

B00004SA8A|2.0|Don't be mistaken, I am a big fan of Kemff myself. As usual, Kempff's performance is more than avarage. However, the recorded sound of these more than adequate performance is bad enough (way too resonant) to make these CDs repulsive! Shame on you DG.
B000000W5L|4.0|Many fellow Stones fans refer to Exile on Main Street as the &quot;best&quot; Stones album, but I disagree.  I have yet to hear a convincing articulation of why this recording is deemed better than Sticky Fingers and Let It Bleed and I can arrive at no explanation myself, despite having listened to it dozens of times.  <br />The tone of this album is slightly darker, more morose and less upbeat than other Stones' records, but also less listenable as a result.  I can and have put my cd on the player from start to finish without significantly noticing it playing in the background, unlike Sticky Fingers, which will usually get me tapping my fingers or singing along with Mr. Jagger and Co.  The problem is that there are very good songs on this album but no great ones.  Additionally, some of the less played songs are kind of filler tunes, that have never grown on me, as did, say, Sister Morphine, Dead Flowers or Moonlight Mile. <br />However, I really like the raw, nasty, gritty blues intensity of Shake Your Hips and Ventillator Blues and the more sentimental harmonies of All Down the Line and Shine a Light.  There are plenty of quality songs on this cd that was once a double LP and it should be an essential part on every serious Stones' fans' list of required recordings; I just don't think it belongs as number one on that list.

The tune with Jon Davis is probably the only song on here that I can see listening to in years to come, though &quot;Break Stuff&quot; is worthy of many re-listens due to the &quot;I can relate&quot; factor.  These guys have the potential to put out some great albums if they took the time to dump the filler.  All in all, it has enough decent music to warrant purchase at a discounted price... just be prepared to skip through about half of it.  You know something?  They MIGHT be a REALLY good band if they got rid of Fred Durst and got a REAL singer.  But that's just my opinion....
B000059MEK|5.0|It's been four long years since Daft Punk released their first album, &quot;Homework&quot; and it seems like the techno scene has risen and fallen as sharply as the stock market during that time period.  Fortunately for fans of the genre, this French duo has come sweeping back upon the stage to inject some seriously needed fun into the music, something that seems to have been seriously missing over the past year or so.<br />\\"Discovery\\" is a throwback to old school, booty moving tunes of the 80's and it's a change in style that Daft Punk takes in a swaggering stride that displays their mastery of the sampler.  These guys can pick a groove blindfolded, and it shows in such snaptacular numbers as \\"One More Time\\", \\"Digital Love\\", and wonderfully wry \\"Too Long\\", and they don't just drop beats, they surgically insert them.  Daft Punk blends intelligent sampling, urbane lyrics, and soulful beats with the results being an album which, by all rights, should be the beat manifesto for this summer's dance floors, and all  for seasons past that.<br />The only short-coming of the entire album is the gimmicky Daft Club addition to the package, which consists of a credit-card like club I.D. which allows you to go online and download special extras from the band.  This turns into an absurdly long process which begs the question &quot;Why not include all the special software on the CD?&quot;  The end result is a collection of extra songs which can only be played through the provided software, and are tracked by some watch-dog every time you play them.  The entire thing seems poorly thrown together, but since it doesn't affect the quality of the album in any way, I haven't let it affect the rating...at least you get a cool Daft Club card to go in your wallet.<br />The bottom line is that this album is one of the best electronica works I have heard this year, and you should definitely go out and get it, just skip the downloads.
B000002J0B|5.0|This was the climax of Led Zeppelin's career.  Released in 1973, this album was the first Zep recording to have a title.  The boys were now mega stars around the world after &quot;IV&quot;... and they had enormous pressure to put out something better.  Well just put in &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and you will soon realize that this is exactly what they did.<br />HotH is not as radio friendly as the first 4 Zep albums were.  In fact, I don't think I've ever heard any of the songs on the radio besides Dy'er Mak'er.  What does this mean?  Nothing.  In fact, it means that this will all be fresh material to you if you haven't heard the album itself before.<br />&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is a fast, fun song with unreal guitar work from Jimmy Page.  Robert Plant's vocals are so-so, but it's reall the music on this song that shines.  Bonham pounds away like the drugged up, freak-genius he was.<br />&quot;The Rain Song&quot; is an absolutely gorgeous acoustic song.  Clocking in at around 7 and a half minutes, it stands right up there with the other Zepics (Stairway, Kashmir, Achilles...).  Very beautiful song here.  Great to listen to... on a rainy day!  What irony ;)  Best song on the CD by far.<br />&quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; starts off with a nice acoustic beginning and turns into a hard rocking good, fun song.  Great riff created by Page here.  My 2nd favorite song.<br />&quot;The Crunge&quot; has a great, funky beat to it.  Another fun, rocking song created by Zeppelin here.  I love it.<br />&quot;Dancing Days&quot; is something almost everyone has heard.  If not by Zeppelin, then by the Stone Temple Pilots who covered it.  Great inventive riff and good vocals by Plant.<br />&quot;Dy'er Mak'er&quot; rules.  It truly does.  A very silly song (just look at the lyrics).  This was the only SINGLE released from &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;...<br />&quot;No Quarter&quot; is pure genius.  Another great Zepic that is very underated.  This song gives me the chills.  Something else to realize is that Tool covered this song.  'Nuff said.<br />The album ends with a great, heavy song &quot;The Ocean&quot;.  Bonham is at his best on this song, and Page's riffs are as usual, heavy as a mother f**ker.  Just like most Zeppelin albums, a rocking way to end another classic recording.<br />I give most of the credit of this masterpiece to Jimmy Page.  The production is astounding.  The order of the songs (an underated factor in albums) is perfect.  Page was a master at this.  He knew exactly how to order the songs so that the listener would not get bored.<br />House of the Holy is my favorite Zeppelin album.  Each song is incredible, and does not sound like anything else on the album.  Everything is fresh, and still sounds as great as it did in 1973.  Great job Led Zeppelin.
6302439566|2.0|After asking this movie I feel compelled to ask &quot;what were you thinking?&quot; to a number of people: John Travolta, Jamie Lee Curtis, Director/Screenwriter James Bridges, and his collaborator, Aaron Latham.  All of them (with the exception of Curtis) were involved in &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, but apparently they went to the well one too many times with this picture.<br />This movie is awful on so many levels.  The script is bloated and pretentious, the directing is laconic, and the plot is predictable.  Travolta and Curtis were annoyingly cute and cliche, and Marilu Henner is without a doubt the worst actress in Hollywood with the possible exception of Rosanna Arquette.<br />This stinkburger of a movie put the brakes on a few careers or at least caused a downward spiral.  Travolta went on to make even worse films (like &quot;The Experts&quot; and &quot;Look Who's Talking&quot;) and practically couldn't get arrested until redeeming himself in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Bridges didn't direct another film until the good but somewhat uneven &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (sadly, his last film).  Curtis survived, but barely.<br />Bad directing, bad casting, and a bad script do not make &quot;Perfect&quot; even mediocre.  Walk away from this train wreck if you can.
B00005AFVR|5.0|As one who was NOT able to get a ticket to any shows of this tour I find it hard to listen to those who have seen 3 have the nerve to complain about the CD. I would like to thank Bruce, Jon, Barbara, or HBO for having the consideration of blessing those of us who were left out with this beautiful compilation. Anyone saying he has less energy, less voice, less anything are obviously numb or anhedonic, because you will never find anyone who gives the way Bruce does. I've had too many negative concert experiences by those I thought were &quot;the ones&quot; to not appreciate any fraction of Bruce's efforts. May I also add that when he sang &quot;The River&quot; it truly felt like he was relating a piece of life from a 51 year old point of view, and, was he not crying for us in the end? The only time I will ever whine about Bruce is when I come up empty on a ticket. Again, thanks for sharing this with those of us who really do care.
B000001Y5J|5.0|this is my favorite NIN.  to me it is nonstop from the opening PINION thru WISH and (my favorite song called) LAST.  angry, emotional, honest, intense, and ROCKING from begginning to end.    This album established Trent as not only an artist worthy of notice but a GREAT producer.  each song blends to the next creating a stellar ride from the emotionally fragile HELP ME I AM IN HELL to HAPPINESS IN SLAVERY.  this was one of the first albums to also play with the cd format and &quot;hide&quot; tracks&quot; inside the album itself.  there is NO disapointment here.  if you do not like this album then your not hearing correctly.
B00004XONN|4.0|I see a lot of people don't think too much of this CD.  I understand why they don't get it, cuz the first time I heard it, I didn't either.  I had just bought The Bends and thought it was awesome, so when this came out, I had to have it.  The first time I listened, I was unimpressed.  A couple songs were okay, but the rest of it seemed like a clumsy arrangement of electronic noises and nothing more.  Occasionally I'd play it, just so I wouldn't feel like I wasted my money.  After a few months of owning it and maybe 10 times listening to it, I had a revelation:  This CD is absolutely amazing.  Maybe you have to be in a certain mood, but it was late at night, the lights were low, and I just tripped out.  From the opening track to the very end, I couldn't believe anything so simple could possess so much genius.  This isn't a very lyrical album, so there aren't really any catchy songs.  The CD is meant to be heard all the way through.  It's become my favorite current CD, a real work of art.  I don't know what Radiohead was thinking when they made it, but it worked.  The reason I give it only four stars is that I realize some people aren't going to like it, no matter what, but just give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.
0691023565|5.0|Critical thinking and problem solving are not stressed in any kind of modern education.  Students tend to take a cookbook approach to problem solving and wonder how is it that some people can think circles around them.  Polya introduces the reader, in a simple yet rigorous manner with heuristics and examples, to how genius does problem solving.  Its fascinating what truly learned people are able to articulate for the rest of us.  Learn how to think outside of the box.
0375501851|1.0|The writing of a procosious child trying to impress. Condescending both to the reader and to her own characters.
0140131558|5.0|What a great book!  Don't you think the cover should have been a Red spiral three-ring notebook?  It's amazing how Auster is able to use similar themes, character names and objects in all of the three stories without having them lose their individual significance and characteristic within each separate story.  This is the first Paul Auster book I have read and if his other books are anything like this one I am excited about what I'm in store for.  This is a great book to read while commuting on the LIRR or subway into Manhattan.  Enjoy!<br />Henry Dark
0316777722|4.0|I have about 20 pages left and I don't want it to end so I'm procrastinating by writing this instead.  This book is a series of essays about Dave's different jobs, his childhood, his family and -- the absolute best -- his stories about moving to France and trying to learn French.  Maybe because I also took French and visited France with a very small grasp of the language did I find those chapters in particular quite hysterical. Also I live in NY and his stories about NY and the tourists (especially around Christmas) are quite true and very funny to me personally. This is my first Sedaris book and I fear I may run out and buy all of his books and try to read them all too quickly -- better to space them out over a few months and make them last.  There are some short chapters so if you're not sure if you want to buy this read a few chapters in the bookstore and then come back and buy it on amazon for cheaper if you liked it.  I read the first couple pages and decided I would like this book and I was correct.    I had to leave the library today because I was the only one laughing and I looked just a teeny bit insane.  Better to read in the privacy of your own home!
B00004XSUW|5.0|This reissue is a good one. The music displayed here is a &quot;roosty&quot; sound that Clapton was seeking after he left the big ol' Marshall sound. Taj, the Band, Dave Mason, Delany &amp; Bonnie..... &amp; the closest he got to it was with the Dominos. Ry Cooder seems to get most of the PR for the guitar work on this album, but the real star is Jesse Ed Davis. He answers Taj's vocals &amp; harps on these tracks from the opening track. While the trend of the day was to play LOUD, the playing of players such as Davis &amp; Robertson was a welcome addition to the music scene. And yes, the Statesboro Blues later influenced a young Duane Allman to pick up a Coricidin bottle....if you are into Taj's &quot;blues&quot; work, this is the place to start.
0780622553|4.0|I guess you could say 'The Matrix' got its inspiration from this movie. Or maybe it just ripped it off!<br />Rufus Sewell plays a man who is being pursued by a bunch of very very weird people. As he runs through the very strange trying to escape from them, he discovers some holes in his life. It just doesn't add up. He later discovers that aliens have pulled a 'Matrix' on the whole city and he is the one who can save all the humans.<br />The similarities of Dark City to The Matrix are staggering though Dark City is well darker, and definitely weirder. In place of scary agents, you have bald headed weirdos in overcoats who look like Pinhead from Hellraiser. An interesting movie to say the least. Very weird and has a rather satisfying ending. Watch it!
0380789019|4.0|Neil takes you on the ride of your life. With every twist and turn you are pulled deeper into the under world. You'll find yourself checking over your shoulder because the characters are so real and the mental pictures are phenomenal.<br />If you are looking for something diiferent in Sci fi/fantasy and want a book that actually ends in that genre this is the book for you.<br />Read! Enjoy! and Never look back.
B000056K04|3.0|This CD is OK. Its good especially I did It and Space Between. Its good 4 DMB fans and alternative/light rock listeners. If you like Dido or some kind of music like that than you should buy this. :P <br />Hey look @ my wishlist n buy me somethin lol
0790725657|5.0|If you remember seeing Shirley Temple in the 1939 \\"The Little Princess,\\" this is the same basic plot with a wonderful new twist. The story is based on the beloved classic by the same author of The Secret Garden.<br /><br />The movie opens with some stunningly beautiful scenes from India and all too suddenly Sara Crewe must leave with her father who is being called away for military duties. Sara has to go live in a New York boarding school. Through her experiences she learns to survive in the world and takes each day as it comes. Her vivid imagination is a pure delight and when she tells her magical stories, they are played out in a fairy tale like way onscreen. This contrasts with her real life at the school.<br /><br />Sara's fun-loving spirit does get her into trouble from time to time. Overall, she is just used to living with her father and being free to do mostly what she likes. In her new school she has to follow many rules. She draws strength from her father's words to help her believe in herself. He tells her that she will always be his little princess.<br /><br />A wonderful movie which shows that if we make the best of our circumstances, we will be blessed in the end. Five stars for storytelling magic!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000056NX4|5.0|I'm a 22 year-old college student who is also the daughter of a UMC pastor. Nevertheless, aside from these minute and unimportant facts, I MUST say, as a MOST devoted Christian who thinks of THE WORLD when it comes to Jesus, the Son of God, I found myself getting goosebumps throughout much of the scenes. When I 1st saw Jesus, I thought, &quot;Hmmm...he has no beard, his hair is sooo nice and shiny, and BOY does he look young!! And also handsome...&quot; At first, I was offended by this new version of a more hipper and more adorable  looking Christ. But then, I thought, what would Jesus think if he saw this new version of him portrayed by Glenn Carter? Thus I left it up to Him to decide, and simply enjoyed the awesome musical. The songs and the lyrics and the singing and the costumes and the staging...they were all very CREATIVE and BLEW this pastor's kid away! When it comes to religion, BOY! is it difficult to talk about...and I KNOW  many people are offended and disgusted by the concept of the ever important and holy role of our Lord and Savior being portrayed by some actors and singers who  themselves have said they do not accept Jesus as the son of God, and to make matters worse, the casting of Jesus has almost always been the handsome-faced, strikingly resembling the Jesus of the western European, and of course a  GREAT voice helps. I'm NOT here to convert anyone to Christianity, nor am I here as a messenger of God. I'm just here as a regular 22 year-old college gale, a pastor's kid, to say that there have been and will be many different  renditions of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.  Some will be inaccurate and will offend some  people. But I ask that you do give THIS one a fair chance. Hey! I even bought the video and CD...and my parents even liked it!!! It was a bit different, I admit, but I'm sure Jesus Himself would understand the pure and innocent concept behind this  new and great musical. I give it Two Thumbs up!! And so do my parents. So all inall, I suppose it's more like... six thumbs up :)!!!
B000056K04|4.0|I've listened to this twice since I bought it for my wife. Definitely more aggression here then your typical DMB record, which I find refreshing. There is a bit less funk to it, and a whole lot less acoustic guitar, both of which I find somewhat disapointing, but I can respect the need to explore new ground. I really dig track 9 &quot;Mother Father.&quot; I'm going to have to spin this a few more times to really know how I feel about it. I can definitely see people either loving or hating this though. You might want to taste it first just in case you fall into the latter category.
B00003CXE7|4.0|There are indeed some historical flaws in this movie, so don't purchase &quot;Gladiator&quot; as a history lesson. As a story, however, it is excellent, with stellar performances by the entire cast. There is no explicit sex (and the only innuendo is shown as desired by one party and rejected by the other, and not accomplished) and only one or two instances of swearing. There are, however, definitely some adult themes of vengeance, incest (desired by the evil emperor, so it's given proper moral context), and gore. Lots of gore. This movie is as gory as you have heard. If that doesn't bother you, however, and great themes of courage, nobility, and justice float your boat, you should purchase this movie.
B00003CXE7|4.0|As history, this movie is a total loss; as a story it tends to be simplistic and sappy.  Basically, this is an action movie, with lots of spectacle and the plot is mostly an excuse to move to the next battle.  As spectacle and action, it's fabulous.
B000053NYB|5.0|THE HURICANE is a movie that is to be seen by all ages and members of the family.  It speaks of a problem which continues to haunt American democracy--racism and prejudice.  The movie communicates its story very well and there are not enough adequate words to say how excellent a job Denzel Washington did as an actor.  I was very, very impresssed with the plot and acting from the very beginning and tears were in my eyes as, finally, Carter was declared innocent.  To think that such blatant things can happen in the America we love in this day and age is unbelievable.<br />I highly recommend the film and would hope that someday Hollywood would consider giving Mr. Washington an oscar for such excellent acting.  It is films such as THE HURRICANE which will create an awareness in the minds of Americans that we can no longer and must no longer tolerate such behaviour by those who are in authority.  In a day when prejudice and racism seem to be on the rise in the so-called first world countries, the movie's message is a must for all.  May God help us!<br />Rev.

B00005AFVR|4.0|Having also attended one of his unforgettable 1999 (four-hour plus) shows, this release was a welcome addition to my Springsteen collection, especially since I generally enjoy live albums.<br />Apart from the afore-mentioned sloppy packaging, the poor track selection and sound mixing are what really spoil some of the the enjoyment here. One of the outstanding things about a Springsteen concert is the awesome audience interplay - none of it comes across on this mix. A 16-minute version of &quot;10th Ave Freezeout&quot; works great on DVD with extended band introduction but would have better been left off here to make room for two other choices on the audio version. I can´t imagine anyone not pushing the &quot;skip&quot; button when they play that CD again.<br />Otherwise, this is a brilliant document of the raw energy and passion Springsteen and his E-Streeters deliver on stage, and the new arrangements for old Boss standards sound great. The two new songs on this collection are moving and wonderfully performed, and I do like the band members´ vocal input a lot.
B000001FY9|5.0|To say Bob Marley was the greatest performer from the Third World does him a colossal injustice. His songs that reached a limited audience in his lifetime has inspired more and more in finding a way through their struggles and share a dignity and understanding people around the world can identify. <br />The 14 songs here represent Bob Marley's tenure with Island records. Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer perform on three of them and their contributions can't be minimized. But, like it or not, Bob was the captain running the ship. And he deserves that respect.<br />Legend was released three years after his death (it was the first album of his that I bought). The album had single versions while this CD uses the album versions which I think benefit his songs. You really NEED to have this CD. All these songs are fantastic (great liner notes, too), but they only scratch the surface. You might also want to check out the box set, &quot;Songs Of Freedom&quot;, that covers Bob's entire recording career. When you listen to his music, every song feels like you're sharing a new experience with Bob's life.<br />If you like this music don't forget to check out &quot;The Best Of Peter Tosh&quot;; his music deserves to be heard, too.
0060920084|5.0|Reaction to Bryson's books demonstrate the huge divide between the US and UK. On this side of the water, we were able to laugh at the fun poked at us in his book,'Notes from a Small Island'. Readers in the US lacked a similar ability to see the funny side of their nation. I first read this book several years ago, and as a frequent visitor to the US, and the Mid west in particular found this book hilarious. Whilst I live in England, I am half American, but still feel able to laugh at the foibles of the American nation. Surely the fact that the American public alone didn't like this book despite its world success, and the fact that all his other books sell well there must indicate that the American readership lack an ability for self examination
B000003TA2|4.0|Sonic Youth breaks the mold with this inventive, hard-driven, sometimes obscure but always breathtaking CD.  From the very beginning of &quot;Dirty Boots&quot;  one can tell they are in for an adventure, but don't take my word for it.  Get a copy of &quot;Goo&quot; and take that long strange trip.
B00004TFK2|5.0|Sorry this is not a review but some info for Rockisgoodfood. You said Columbia Tristar should release a 2:53.1 version of this movie. My question is this.. why would you want to do that? This film is presented in its OAR (original aspect ratio) which is 1:85.1 shot on 35mm film. If columbia Tristar was to make a 2:35.1 aspect ratio of this movie... it would literally have to be cropped and cut. Why would you want that? This dvd is 1:85.1 anamorphic widescreen. You cant get anymore than that without destroying the film. If this film was made 2:35.1 it would probably have the actors heads chopped off and things like that.
B000001Y42|1.0|OK, I admit it, I used to be into Limp Bizkit, but than I starded listening to better music(REAL music if you will), and I eventually lost all interest in them. So you see, there is hope for everyone. This isn't quite as bad as Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water(although is comes very close), but it is mediocre at best. I find it funny how you people insult boy and girl groups, because Limp Bizkit is just a boyband if you take away the instruments. I read a review where someone said that Fred Durst is the premier vocalist in heavy music, and I couldn't help but laugh. He might have a chance at that if a bomb went off and killed Max Cavalera, Phil Anselmo, Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, Trent Reznor, Chino Moreno, James Hetfield, and pretty much every vocalist out there. I also read a review where someone said that this CD started the Rap/metal craze. Have you not heard of Anthrax or Biohazard? How about Rage Against The Machine? They were mixing rap and rock/metal before Limp Bizkit was even a band. Well, back to the subject, you would be best spending your money on something better, like I said this is mediocre at best.
B000059Z8M|5.0|Usually Disney Sequels stink up the place, no so with Toy Story 2.  My kids liked it better than Toy Story, it's just great!  Everything equals the quality in the first one, and even the story line is fresh which is hard to do in sequels.  This is a must have!
0380796090|5.0|Looking for a quick and easy yet very funny book to read?  Then you should definitely check out Watermelon by Marian Keyes.  Claire is dumped by her husband right after she gives birth to their daughter.  She moves back to her family in Ireland to mend.  You'll probably find yourself laughing out loud a lot as Clair and her family are pretty off the wall, yet you'll also probably relate to each character on some level, as I did. <br />A very cute story, perfect to entertain yourself with during your train commute, vacation, or while unwinding after work.
B00004XMSN|5.0|I found this gem only two years ago.  Being enamored  of Grant, I had not seen him &quot;perfect&quot; until I saw this film.  What is really great is that a review preceded  the showing. This is where I learned that originally, Niven had the angel role and Grant was the preacher.  Soon after rehearsal began, Grant insisted that they switch parts and Niven agreed to do so.  The switch was the magic that makes this film work.  The movie is poignant and makes one long for that type of intervention and outcome.  A must see each holiday season.
B00000JCB2|1.0|You may have read my review where I gave them 2 stars. I was wrong, this does not deserve 2 stars. Not even Scott Weiland and Jonathan Davis could save this album. It's that bad. &quot;N2gether Now&quot; is just Fred attempting to rap, and doing a ...poor job at it, Method Man(being the MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better lyricisist) makes him sound even worse. Like I said before, Fred should be grateful that people who actually have talent are willing to share a mic with him.
B00003Q43A|1.0|independance day has lots of fancy visual effects, that is for sure. but the emptyness of the scenario and its incoherences. the VERY poor acting of the main actors, and the general blind patriotic idea of this movie makes me spit all over it. this movie has no intellectual value, and will only please teenagers in search of brainless sensations, or people who think that a decent scenario and some content are useless to make a good movie. not recommended.
B000051VQR|4.0|This album has been criticised for not being rock enough but in my view it's their best Album. Stand-Out tracks would be CastAway, Minority , The upcoming single: Waiting and the best track on the album: BLOOD SEX and BOOZE. This is one of those albums you have to listen to a few times. It's more catchy because you can hear Billy Joe (Singer) more clearly. If you liked Dookie you'll love this.  ROCK ON !!!!
B00004U8DV|4.0|The Doors last stand. A bit of a departure from the earlier recordings. This was Jim's last recording before his death. A very bluesy effort with a laid back sound throughout. Songs like the Changeling, Love her madly and others are more real and not contrived just for the sake of doing a different record.  Jim  sounds like a blues shamen on this one.  Too bad they never got to build from this one. Riders on the Storm rejoice and pick this one up.
1572522232|5.0|For those who are not familiar with the italian horror genre or with Dario Argento this is the film to watch in order to be correctly introduced to Argento and the genre. The film is about an american ballet dancer named Suzy Bannon(Jessica Harper) who is accepted into a prestigous ballet school in Germany. But then she discovers that the headmistresses and some of the other staff are actually a coven of witches. Don't concern yourself with the plot because this movie is not about the plot. In this film Argento uses every method he can to scare the bejesus out of you. Creepy camera movements, a terrifying music score which he composed and which is played by Goblin, great cinematography  (a great use of the colors blue, red, yellow, and green) and an immense amount of blood and gore which only adds to the terror. Your senses experience a rush watching this film, especially in the dark and that was the intention. Jessica Harper turns in the best acting ever seen in an Argento film and the supporting cast is good as well, it includes Alida Valli(THE THIRD MAN, INFERNO) and Joan Bennett(THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, SCARLETT STREET). He also co-wrote the film with his wife Daria Nicolodi(TENEBRE, PHENOMENA). It was based on a story she heard from her grandmother about when her grandmother was young how she enrolled in a school and how she discovered that the teachers did witchcraft. And the first ten minutes of the film are unforgettable, they are arguably the best sequence in an Argento film. They inclue one of the most terrifying and one of the most bloody murders in film history. I dare say it even rivals the shower scene in PSYCHO. This film has been acclaimed by critics around the world and it had a great commercial success too. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. Do not miss it.
0671027344|3.0|I am not a big reader....by any means. So when the book is on something that has to do with adolecents (since I am one) and growing up in the 90's, I automatcially know it'll be right up my alley. I'm normally not picky as long as the dialect is in regular english! But with The Perks... I was not overly impressed. I thought that most parts of the book were well written and I especially liked what Charlie had to say for himself. But i felt like in certain areas the plot got a little too weird for me and it made me resent the main character Charlie. Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely liberal, so that aspect of the book didn't bother me. What did bother me is when Charlie wouldn't stick up for himself in situations. You get the sense that as much as the author wants the reader to believe the main character has made some progress in life though it's apparent that he hasn't at all. In the end of the book I wound up realizing that my favorite character wasn't even the Charlie. It was the apple of his eye Sam who kept Charlie in perspective. The final twist in the story was so out of place that I felt like the author threw it in. There were no hints all along and it just didn't seem to fit. It was so out of place that i had to re-read it several times just to make sure what the author was implying. Over all this book had major potenial but fell seriously short.
B000059XVS|5.0|David Lean's film is a masterful blend of history, adventure and psychology.  O'Toole's intense performance is the centerpiece of the film along with the striking desert scenery.  Be sure to get this one in widescreen to capture the mystique of the desert and the epic proportions of the film. The astounding cinematography along with Mauice Jarre's stirring score captures the mystery and the exotic lure of Arabia.  O'Toole's performance is masterful--this is the film that made him a star.  Alec Guiness plays an enigmatic Prince Feisal--one of his great over-looked roles.  A must see for any true film historian
B00005B1EX|5.0|This album needs to be in every metal fan`s collection. I know you hear this often, but trust me this is by far the best Live album ever. You get four decades of Rob Halford at his best. The recent material, the underrated Fight material, and the good ol` Priest stuff. The sound quality is exceptional, Rob`s vocals are at his best, the guitars sound terrific, etc. Plus you have three extra tracks at the end, what more do you need? This album is an instant classic! Rock on
B0000029AL|4.0|After two decades of not being quite sure what my opinion of Aerosmith was, I finally broke down and bought this CD two weeks ago.<br />I can't stop listening to it.<br />There are some odd things here--for example, how come &quot;Make It&quot; is so good, even though Joe Perry's guitar solo is not quite in tune and is totally out of time?  Is he playing along with a different song?  And  who did the lousy overdubbed lead guitar on &quot;Somebody&quot;? It's played bad and edited even worse. And what's with the goofy intro to the great &quot;Walkin' The Dog&quot;?<br />The real revalation, after years of hearing nothing but talk of coke addictions and internal squabbling associated with Aerosmith, is how fun and downright optimistic this band can be.  &quot;Make It,&quot; &quot;Dream On,&quot; even &quot;Mama Kin,&quot; all sound to me like declarations of independence and musical freedom from Steven Tyler.  In it's best moments, this album doesn't just rock; it SWINGS.<br />&quot;Dream On&quot; is pure magic--and inspired, too, because there is nothing else here with the same level of musical sophistication--and it hasn't been rendered impotent by radio overkill the way that contemporaries like &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; or &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; were.<br />I'm shocked to find that this record is carried NOT by Joe Perry--most gorups of the genre lean so heavily on lead guitarists--but by by bassist Tom Hamilton and (I spent years trying to avoid saying these words) the GREAT Steven Tyler.<br />I've spent two weeks listening to this, two weeks searching for the word to describe Tylers vocals, and I keep coming back to my initial adjective: MUSCULAR.<br />My god the guy can sing. He makes me feel strong and macho just listening to him. Trust me, that's saying a lot.<br />I loved the Rocks LP years ago, but even that album didn't display the guys throat like this CD.  He could do ANYTHING at this point, and they were fresh off the bar circuit. He was what--20?--and gave Jagger a run for his money, right out of the box.<br />I hate to admit it, but you can now count me among the Aerosmith clan.<br />Rats.
0790734850|5.0|Based on the creative, ingenious, and sometimes confusing novel by James Ellroy, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; tells a story about three detectives during 1953 who get caught up in the sleeze of Hollywood and Los Angeles during its golden age.<br />Directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and written for the screen by Brian Helgeland &amp; Curtis Hanson, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; is not just one of the best films of the 90's, it's one of the best films of all time, if not the greatest.  The reasoning: Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.  The movie was concentrated around DIALOGUE and not action.  Characters expressed themselves fully and viewers never wondered what they were thinking.<br />Hanson and casting director Mali Finn do a fantastic job with their choice of actors.  Russell Crowe (The Insider, Romper Stomper, Gladiator) plays Bud White, a cop who has loyalty to his department and to his partner and will commit violent acts to any wife beater.  He seems to have more of a fight in him then brains, but that is all changed when he meets Lynn Bracken, played by Kim Basinger (his Academy Award winning role.)  She finds the truth in every character she meets, and inspires Bud to relook at the Night Owl Case, a case where the facts just do not seem right.  He knows something's up, his partner was shot there, but he does not know what.<br />Guy Pearce plays Ed Exley, a man who would do anything for advancement, like rat out his fellow officers which he does.  He becomes Lieutenant Detective after his trial on &quot;Bloody Christmas&quot; which was when the officers beat up Mexicans.  Exley has Jack Vincennes, Kevin Spacey, also get to testify.  Vincennes is a crooked cop, he works with Sid Hudgens, Danny DeVito, who is a journalist for &quot;Hush, Hush,&quot; a magazine that exposes the dirty truth about Hollywood.  Hudgens finds some stars that are doing illegal things, like pot, and sends Vincennes to go out and arrest them.  Hudgens takes his picture, and Vincennes gets a nice payoff.<br />All three of the main characters, (White, Exley, Vincennes,) have totally different personalities and ways of keeping the street clean, and all three of these characters are connected with the Nite Owl Massacre.  Each one goes about it differently, even when they are partnered up, to find the truth, the lies, the deceit, and to find out the kind of person they truly are.  The climax is one of the most exciting and riveting endings film has had in a long time.<br />This film is definitely the greatest modern movie (my personal favourite.)  Russell Crowe plays one of the most memorable and greatest characters.  (If you are a fan, or even if you are not, you will HAVE to see this.)  The whole cast is tremendously great at their parts.  You will not be disappointed if you see this.  The music is great, the bright film-noir-ish kind of filming is beautiful, the story is wonderful AND PERFECT, and the dialogue is key.<br />&quot;Remember dear readers, you heard it here first, off the record, on the QT, and very HUSH HUSH!&quot;
0553573403|5.0|Finally, good fantasy written so well that you just can't stop reading!  The characters are real - so real you cheer,cry and get angry.  This is not a simple good/evil story with outrageous magic and the &quot;good guys&quot; winning every step.  There are heros you will love and characters you will hate, with plenty of people struggling in between. Martin tries to give various points of view by alternating chapters around different characters.  He succeeds in drawing you into each character - they become familiar and alive. This is the best I've read in many years - keep it coming!
B00000JR29|3.0|The original of this album is an '80s classic, but this tarted-up edition adds nothing new particularly worth having. Five of the seven new songs are just junk that you'll never listen to more than once. The two remixes are pleasant, but not particularly interesting. All told, stick to the original album; there's a reason why TFF didn't put these other songs on &quot;Songs from the Big Chair.&quot; And there's a reason why the record company has put them on now: To get you to buy a record you probably already have.
B00004RFDW|1.0|This movie was a flop at the box office, and deserved to be. This was a trivial incident to base a whole movie on. And it wasn't carried off well. I thought it was badly done, and shouldn't have been done at all. And I don't like cigarette companies, and I still didn't like this movie.
B0000560RV|5.0|This is ablsolutely one of my favorite albums. I had been looking for something totally different, and I have found it. I've been listening to Sigur Ros' Agaetis Byrjun since over a month and its one of those cd's that are constantly around your stereo. Overwhelmed by the voices and phrases of the Intro song, Svefn G Englar is the kind of song that you want to listen to next. And it does. I really don't know what this guy sings but I definitely ended up singing along. The mood, it's mere hope.<br />I have realised with time I had been needing different music, but music with so much feeling. I put this cd and it just takes me away to a place where everything's just calm. And when I want to just fit in a perfect song, Hjartad Hamast is the song. Definitely my favorite. Just buy it. Don't listen to people who complain about a fancy case and drawings. Stick to what's important, finding bands that comply, that will make you know that not everything's invented, that a cello stick can create an atmosphere you will never forget. I'm waiting for translations now. BUt for now I'll just keep singing along. THis is by far one of the best cd's I have ever bought. DOn't. DOn't miss it.
B000002LMM|4.0|This CD takes you straight into the world of Twin Peaks. You will ponder the stars burning in space with Laura, dance in a faded blue light in a the Log Cabin and miss your innocence, feel the air pushed by the fan at the top of the stairs, tap-dance that jazzy little tune with the Devil, and....simply marvel at the brilliance of meistro David Lynch.

B00004Z400|5.0|Yes more. This should have been a double c.d. 100%. Even the orginal 11 track version should have been a double c.d. This is just too damn good to not be. Some of the best songs are b-sides and not on here. If I was to be the Deftones and re-issue this than I would have made it a double c.d. with atleast 6 songs on the second c.d. This is an album that you can listin to from track 1 to 11 (12) {depending on what you have}. This c.d. sets the mood greatly. It's the best c.d. I've ever bought. If you don't have this then you need to get it. I don't care if you don't like hard rock you still need to get this. There is a complete mixture of rap rock, hard rock, and mellow rock. This is an album that I can't put down even if I try. I can't go 2 weeks with out listing to this.
0451160916|5.0|When most readers hear the name Stephen King, they often thing of a genre or horror writer.  The Shining proves that Stephen King is more than that, that beyond the intense and terrifying scenes of psychological rage (COME TAKE YOUR MEDICINE!  COME TAKE IT LIKE A MAN!) and ghostly images of decades past (after reading this, you will never stay in Room 217 of ANY hotel) there is a disturbing portrayal of an American Family and a very philosophical comment on the role of history in our lives.  <br />What happens when a man and his family are locked in a giant hotel miles from civilization for an entire winter?  What if the hotel were haunted, and he was a reformed abusive alcoholic?  The beginning of the novel sets these questions up with magestic style.  <br />The outcome is the disturbing tale of Jack, the caretaker, being brainwashed by the haunted Overlook Hotel.  Can he fight the voices telling him to kill his wife and son?  Delbert Grady, a past caretaker, could not when he chopped up his family with an axe.  And Delbert is only one of many of the &quot;residues&quot; of the past.  The past at the Overlook is also the present and future.  The same party happens over and over in the ballroom.  Lloyd is always ready to bartend if Jack just really needs a drink.<br />The Shining is also a comment on how children are like their parents.  Notice the similarity between Danny and Daddy - Jack is a writer, while Danny is obsessed with reading.  When Danny is catatonic, Jack gives him some cherry to calm him down (Didn't Jack used to do the same?).  What Jack doesn't understand is that sons do not have to be like their fathers.<br />If you want a book that tenses your every muscle and something to think about, try The Shining.  It won't dissapoint you.
B000002J03|5.0|After their ground breaking debut album, Led Zeppelin quickly followed the album up with Led Zeppelin II.  Whereas their debut contained a few blues covers and longer jams, II is a much tighter affair.  Jimmy Page was a master at coming up with memorable guitar riffs and they abound throughout II.  &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; opens the album with a earth moving riff and then guitars soar and come crashing down throughout the song that is marked by a glass shattering vocal from Robert Plant.  The song became a big hit and their only top ten single peaking at number 4 in early 1970.  &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; is a bluesy jam that finds Mr. Plant scatting along with some memorable lyrics.  &quot;Ramble On&quot; is perfectly titled as the song just kind of scuffles around with a chooglin guitar riff as its backbone.  John Bonham gets to show off why they call him Bonzo on the drum workout &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. &quot;Thank You&quot; has to rank as one of the prettiest songs in rock and probably the most tender number the band has ever recorded.  Mr. Plant provides an almost whisper like vocal that is framed by ethereal keyboards from John Paul Jones.  The song's quiet beauty merges into the stinging guitars of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; which merges seamlessly into the rollicking &quot;Living Loving Maid&quot;.  Led Zeppelin II became the band's first number one album.
B000001DTM|5.0|I was a child of 12. I had never heard of u2, what they stood for,who they were etc. One phone call changed my entire musical life. On a sunny day I found out that one of my favourite cousin's liked a band called u2 so I thought I should try and hear what they are. On a whim I bought Achtung Baby because the cover was attractive. I drove everyone who knew me at the time insane with playing the tape over and over again. Even at the tender age of twelve, I felt and knew this was not like other rock bands with the sound they had and this was going to stay with me. the extremely pleasing opening of Zoo Station to the guitar riffs of the The Fly, i was hooked. I have played this album more time then I can count and it never gets boring. Thats what real music is. Recently I had the very special oppurtunity to see u2 live in concert at the elevation tour with very front row seating where I could see Bono clearly. When  he sang his songs and bursted into The Fly, I could tell this music was special ,Could see in Bono's eyes. I came back from the concert and gave the album a listen and I appreciate it so much more.<br />1-Zoostation has one of the best beginnings to any rock song I have ever heard and the way it builds up is nothing short of incredible with the melody.<br />2-Love is Blindness is a tender soulful track with The Edge's guitar playing like a prayer.<br />3-So cruel is a very well manufactured pop ballad, up there with the top<br />this album is nothing short of magical with every song such a piece of beauty that it still dazzles me after more then thousands of listenings.<br />this is the best rock band out there for me, having touched my life with their lyrics and music. I wish for you to share with me this joy. Give it a try.<br />if you regret it, give me a buzz on my email.<br />K
B000002J1U|5.0|After the thundering success of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin showed that they had more than just a heavy metal side.  Led Zeppelin III has an acoustic based, earthy sound and in most places finds the band in a mellow mood.  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; opens the album with a driving kick that belies what will follow.  &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Celebration Day&quot; show off Jimmy Page's skills on the acoustic guitar while retaining the power of their electric work.  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is a mournful blues dirge in which Robert Plant bleeds his heart out all over the song.  John Bonham contributes the fine &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot;.  &quot;Gallow's Pole&quot; starts with a slow beat and then builds and builds and picks up speed like water rising in a dam.  The water keeps getting higher and then tension builds in the song before it comes bursting free at the end.  &quot;Tangerine&quot; is beautiful song that doesn't get many mentions as a great Zep song, but despite its seeming subtlety, it one of the most intricate of their songs and one of their all-time best.  III is among the most critically bashed of their albums, but the acoustic nature of it was a precursor to the Unplugged albums of the 90's and the album deserves alot more credit than it gets.
0385335482|4.0|Well, not really quite as bad as the main character Rebecca Bloomfield, but I have certainly understood the mounting pressue of bills.  I am not quite the shopper she is either!<br />A delightful book in which Ms. Kinsella develops a wonderful first person voice and character.  It is perhaps the center point of the entire book.  You keep reading to she what Bex (as she is called by her flatmate) will think next.  For the majority of the book her mind is alomst always in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In fact, the joy of her character is the insistence on remaining herself.<br />The character development is the overwhelming joy of this book.  The plot get reptitive around 3/4 of the way through the book until the climax comes around, but this is hardly a downfall of the book.  There are also some interesting literary references (intended or unintended) to other author's first books, e.g. The Sun Also Rises.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is the most underrated album in the Led Zeppelin catalog.  Released after the sprawling double album that was Physical Graffiti, Presence contains only seven tracks.  The album was recorded while Robert Plant was on the mend from an almost fatal car crash and the songs are heavier on the instrumentation side to compensate for Mr. Plant's physical condition.  The album offers a chance for Jimmy Page to really stretch the limits of his guitar playing and the album contains some his most intricate and interesting work.  &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot; opens the album and it is an absolutely amazing track.  Stretching out over ten minutes, the song is an epic display of the band's musical prowess.  &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; has a ringing guitar and thunderous drum playing from John Bonham.  &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; has an old time rock and roll feel with Mr. Plant sneering on it like the King himself.  &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; is fun and loose song that rambles joyfully along.  &quot;Tea For One&quot; is a slow blues dirge that ends the album on a sobering note.  Presence was yet another number one album for the band.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second and third albums had both gone to number one and they had become the biggest band in music.  Despite their legion of fans, the critics were not kind to them.  Upon the release of their fourth record, they decided to let their music do the talking.  The album is untitled (Though various names abound like Led Zeppelin IV, Runes, Zoso), contains no reference to band and has no track listing.  The album contains a mere eight songs, but they are among the most powerful and memorable in rock music.  There is a mystic and medieval aura emanating from the album.  The album kicks off with the sledgehammer riffs of &quot;Black Dog&quot; that contains a heavily echoed vocal from Robert Plant.  &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; is just what the title says, a frenetic song that rocks and rolls with manic fury.  &quot;Battle Of The Evermore&quot; is a mystical song that plays to Zeppelin's dark side.  &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; is the most requested song in the history of FM radio and though it has been overplayed to death, it achieved its status for a reason.  From the quiet opening of an acoustic guitar and flute that slowly builds to a crashing crescendo to its cryptic lyrics to its grandly majestic vocals and powerful instrumentation, the song strives for greatness and achieves it.  &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; is an almost funky song with some great keyboards from John Paul Jones.  John Bonham pounds some mean skins on the powerful &quot;Four Sticks&quot; while &quot;Going To California&quot; is a lush and beautiful song that has a tender vocal from Mr. Plant.  The album closes with a song that is almost an equal in the epic standards of &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;.  &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot; is a driving, pulsating, blues-based song that has a piercing harmonica and master guitar work by Jimmy Page.  Surprising, this album never made it to number one.  It spent four weeks at number two, but has gone on to sell over 20 million copies and ranks as one the ten best selling albums in music history.  Not too shabby for an album that doesn't even have a title.s as one the ten best selling albums in music history.  Not too shabby for an album that doesn't even have a title.
1892065290|5.0|With drawings every 2-3 pages this edition is illustrated.  The images are reused throughout the book, but are generic enough to fit in multiple areas.  The borders around the text are a bit thin, since space is needed for the images.  Although a bit steep in price, this edition surpasses the Bantam edition in quality.  With Meisha Merlin signing Charles Vess for A Storm of Swords, I'm looking forward to the future books in the series.
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses Of The Holy is probably the most melodic of all Led Zeppelin's albums.  The album has full and layered sound that relies more on the band's powerhouse rhythm section of John Paul Jones and John Bonham than on Jimmy Page's guitars.  Don't worry though, Mr. Page's powerhouse riffs abound throughout the album, but they are deftly mixed in to create a bigger sound.  Mr. Jones' keyboards are found in heavy doses which is a welcomed thing.  &quot;The Crunge&quot; is a James Brown tribute that has a loose, funky feel and &quot;Over The Hills &amp; Faraway&quot; is a driving rocker.  &quot;Dancing Days&quot; has a melodious beat with a stinging guitar and &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; is a reggae influenced song and is one of the few Zeppelin songs you can actually dance to.  &quot;No Quarter&quot; is the most mystical and darkest of all of Zeppelin's songs.  The music has strange keyboards and Robert Plant's voice is so distorted that is sounds like he's singing under water.  The lyrics are Tokleinesque in nature and the song is a mini masterpiece.  The album closes out with the thumping &quot;The Ocean&quot;.  Houses of The Holy has another infamous Zeppelin cover and brought them back to number one.
0790729628|5.0|In 1982, Ridley Scott gave us a vision of the future that we never can't get rid it in our minds. Deckard ( Harrison Ford) is a dectective who is after Replikant Cyborg Criminals who want to be human and they must be exterminated. Excellent film! filled with romance, action, suspense and will leave you breathless. neverthless, it's a must have for Sci-fi Fans. Recommended films to go with this: The Fifth Element, The Matrix, Total Recall, Brazil, Heavy Metal, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and The Terminator saga.
B00004YM0D|5.0|A little bit of country, a little bit of soul, and great rock and roll. It's about time they came out with a movie with music from the early seventies--the pinnacle of rock and roll. I'll tell you what you ought to do--you ought to first buy this CD then get in your car . . . turn down the trebble and crank up the bass and push those speakers right to the edge of blowing. Then let it rip, first, with Spirit in the Sky, then Long Cool Woman--heck every song on the CD is great listening. Just make sure there's no cops around when you play it because it makes you feel wild.<br />The early seventies were great, beacuse as the movie &quot;Remember The Titans&quot; exemplifies, the seventies mark a coming-out from prejudice, and bigotry. It's sad, however, what's happening in places across the US. Some cities, today, appear to have taken a &quot;giant step&quot; backwards to the undesirable times of the sixities. Perhaps they should show &quot;Remember The Titans&quot; at their movie theatres to help remind them of the awful struggle that caused too much death and sadness. At the very least, you can purchase this movie and CD to remind you of how ugly racism can be. Do it in celebration of the time when you realized you no longer had contempt or dislike for any color, race, or creed.
B00000K19E|5.0|Came out during the same time &quot; The Phantom Menace&quot; came out but that one was ok but this is far superior in many ways. The plot deals with &quot; Neo&quot; ( Keanu Reeves) who is a nobody worker that gets involved with a Cybersystem called &quot; The Matrix&quot;, he is now in the trap. Truely Outstanding!!! a masterpiece that you must own on DVD.<br />Recommendations: The Fifth Element, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Metropolis, Dark City, Ghost in the Shell and Con Air.
B00003CXQY|5.0|What can I say, I took my 3 kids to see this truly funny movie and they sat through the whole thing.  The first thing they asked me when we were departing the theater was, &quot;Daddy can we buy the tape&quot;.  They have a lot of Disney movies, but I believe this will be the most watched Disney tape in our house since Toy Story.  I say buy it, enjoy it, its one for the collection.
1559408898|5.0|A Ultra-violent Science-Fiction Action thriller from Paul Verhoeven ( Total Recall, Basic Instict) about a lone Cop named Murphy ( Peter Weller) who gets dismembered by a gang, comes back as a Cyborg named &quot; Robocop&quot; who has a taste for revenge and justice. The Director's Cut is fabulous and amazing, it's even perfect and flawless in my opinion with the storyboards, uncut scenes and everything that a Robofan would love. It's got Gore, Violence and Humor galore, a must see! recommendations for this movie: Blade Runner, The Matrix, Total Recall, Evil Dead, Starship Troopers, Heavy Metal, The Fifth Element, Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Akira, Scanners and Ghost in the Shell.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Given the mindless state of entertainment today, it's a miracle that this movie was ever made - with big name Hollywood stars, no less. This movie captures the inner landscape of isolated, emotionally-disconnected modern people like no other movie I've ever seen. I especially recommend this movie to people who are fascinated by cults (because that's what the Fight Club truly is).
6304806434|5.0|This is one of my top 13 films of all time and it's also the best Action film ever made! thanks to Jerry Bruckheimer. Cameron Poe ( Nicolas Cage) is a Solider who gets sent to prison for manslaughter and 10 years later, he is coming home to see his wife and daughter. He hops up in a airplane called &quot; Con Air&quot; and now it's being held hostage by Cyrus The Virus ( John Malkovic) who demands that the plane will fly all the way to Las Vegas and have everything his way. It's a Great, perfect and Kick-A#$ ride that is one of the best films i've seen in my existnace with ID4, The Fifth Element, Matrix and so many others.<br />You Won't be Disappointed and it's a must own for hard core action lovers and for those looking for a good time.<br />Recommendations: The Matrix, Total Recall, Commando, In The Army Now, The Rock, Die Hard trilogy, Independence Day, Armageddon, and Terminator 2.
B000002H33|5.0|This one hell of a album! Awesome riffs and incredible Lyrics. This album is arguably the best Metallica album (Although i think ...And Justice For All is the Best). But most of all, this is the last album with the bass god Cliff Burton (R.I.P) Just check out his work in &quot;Orion&quot; and/or the beginning of &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; Kirk is in his prime on this album with awesome Solo's. Lars does a great job on drums, but his best work can be found on the Justice Album. James has great lyrics and his guitar work is incredible. Once Again, this is a GREAT album!<br />Tracks are:<br />1. Battery: Starts with a acoustic intro, but soon rips into one of the fastest songs on the album. Lighting quick riffs and great drum work. Kirk's work is great as well.<br />2. Master Of Puppets: The most Popular song of the album, and I don't blame people. This is a great song clocking at 8 minutes and 38 seconds, but it is never boring. Starts off with one of the most regonizable riffs ever. Great lyrics and awesome solo by Kirk. I especially love the slow part in the middle. a Great song!<br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be: My Least Favorite Song, but it still is great! The song itself is pretty weird. It is based on a H.P. Lovecraft book. The song starts off with a very eerie acoustic riff, but soon rips into one of the heaviest songs of the album. Heavy the entire way, with AWESOME lyrics and very cool sounding solo.<br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium: The Albums Ballad. One Damn fine song. Starts off slow and stays like that for a while. About 3 mintues into the song, it starts to get heavy. Kirk has not 1, not 2, but 4 solos in this song. In my opinion, they are his best on the whole cds. Lyrics are great and the ending is really cool.<br />5. Disposable Heroes: My favorite track on the album! AWESOME song! Lyrics about the truth of warfare. In my opinion, this song has the best lyrics on the album. Great work by James, but Cliff does an Awesome job on this song. Kirk has apretty long solo too. This song is also more than 8 minutes long, but it never get's boring. Just a plain great song! They need to play this live more often!!!<br />6. Leper Messiah: One Heavy Track. Lyrics about the utter ...that is Televangelism. Agian, this is one heavy track. Great guitar work by James and Kirk has one cool solo. A very good track.<br />7. Orion: The Instrumental track. The majority of this song was written by Cliff Burton. Cliff's work is AMAZING! It starts of with a organ-like sound which is played by Cliff. It then gets into a slow, but heavy pattern. It eventually picks up for while, only to be slowed down again. This time, Cliff plays by himself for a second until James and Kirk come in with a almost Blues-like sound. It becomes very melodic and very enjoyable to listen to. It eventually picks up again and ends like that. A AMAZONG song.<br />8. Damage Inc.: What a way to end a album! This song starts off with Bass solo by Cliff showing his massive skills. It then picks up into the most fast, brutal, and heaviest track on the album. This is probably the heaviest Metallica song EVER. Great guitar work. Awesome Drum, and a INCREDIBLE solo. Lyrics are about the craving of descruction. A AWESOME song. This should be played more often!!<br />So there you have it. This is one of Metallica's best work. Fans of Load and Re-Load will be in for a suprise when they hear this, but it is still a great album. If you like this Album, check out ...And Justice For All and Ride The Lighting. Hope This Helps!
B00000JMOJ|5.0|Funny, exciting and amazingily fun movie, set in the future about a Ex-Con ( Arnold Schwartzenger) who was framed for murder and he joins in a deadly game show that almost kills him. if you like this movie i would recommend these similar films: The Fifth Element, The Matrix, Total Recall, Commando, Blade Runner, Heavy Metal, Akira, and Army of Darkness.
6300214826|1.0|What happens when you mix a good director with a good cast and a boring, half-baked plot? You get &quot;Apocolypse Now.&quot;  <br />AN's plot is too bizarre to have even a modicum of credibility and having seen this film a couple of times, I still don't get the point of it. AN also suffers from dull and one-dimensional characters. Likewise, AN also suffers from bad directing and editing which makes it a rather difficult movie to follow. <br />For all its potential, AN never lives up to its hype and I fail to see why it received so much acclaim. For a war movie, AN doesn't have a lot of action so if you're a war movie buff, chances are it won't hold your interest. If anything, AN is about as interesting as watching dust settle on your VCR.
B00004TRD8|5.0|The Terminator is back and this time he is here to protect a boy from a shapeshifting assassin. James Cameron gave his word that he promised a Sequel! so he did. opened in 1990, it gave audiences a new look about humanity and showed what special effects can be different. This DVD includes all the extras that a DVD owner can enjoy including special edition and extended special edition with a awesome menu, including Trailers, behind the scenes and everything to satisfy your appetite for action.<br />Recommendations: Ghost in the Shell, Original Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall, Akira, Stargate, Independence Day, The Abyss, and The Matrix.
B00000IQBL|1.0|\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is really two movies in one. The first half's theme is how raw recruits are molded into lean, mean, fightin' machines while the second half's theme shows how war is hell. If there's a REAL plot to this movie, it escapes me. If Kubrick had made this movie along the lines of \\"Tribes,\\" he might've gotten somewhere. Instead, he made a boring, uneven film that wastes your time and takes you nowhere.<br />Although the boot camp portion of this film was very funny, the transition from boot camp to the jungles of Nam is too abrupt. An established director like Kubrick should've recognized that this was poor cinema syntax.<br />The second half of this film is a real bore! There's more talk than action and there's no closure. Kubrick apparently couldn't decide whether to make this a pseudo-documentary film or a mocking political commentary. Either way, he failed miserably. <br />After watching this film, my reaction was SO WHAT?! FMJ has some good moments but it's not worth the price of admission. If you want to see a really good film about the Viet Nam War, check out \\"Casualties of War.\\" Unlike, FMJ, it's got a good plot and the acting is solid.
B00000JMQE|5.0|In the summer of 1985, a film called &quot; Return to Oz&quot; bombed at the box-office, failed with critics but it did recieved a cult following including with Children of the 80's. the plot starts with &quot; Dorothy Gale&quot; ( Fariuza Balk) who goes back to Oz and finds it in the hands of Princess Mombi and The Nome King. Now it's up to her with new pals &quot; Tic-Tok&quot;, &quot; Gump&quot; and &quot; Jack Pumpkinhead&quot; to restore the whole mess that is going on in Oz. One of my top fantasies of all time with it's prequel Wizard of Oz, it's great for Kids but it gets a little scary and dark at times, but Who cares! it's still a good time for the whole family.<br />Recommendations: The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, The Last Unicorn, Wizard of Oz, The Evil Dead, City of Lost Children, Brazil, Time Bandits, Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Fifth Element, Total Recall, Neverending Story, The Black Cauldron, Willow, and Sword in the Stone.
0792156684|2.0|Going into this movie, I already had reservations, having heard the stories from teenage girls claiming with pride to have seen the movie multiple times (some into the tens, and a few even more). I predicted at once that the movie was a sappy love story playing off of the teenage generations then-obsession with girly Leonardo Dicaprio, and when I finally saw it, I was not surprised.  Line after line of vapid dialogue assaulted me from all sides; I was pounded unconscious by the lack of plot or charcacter development.  Kate Winslet's being the exception, every character in the movie was as one-dimensional and cliched as could be.  The only thing that saved this film from total turkeydom in my opinion is the amazing special effects during the sinking scene, a Cameron trademark, and the enjoyment of seeing a few Cameron regulars (Bill Paxton and Jeanette Goldstein, to name a few).  Overall, unless you still have something for Leo, or Kate, for that matter, avoid this cliched monster of a mishap.  <br />Good Will Hunting, all the way!
B00000K19E|3.0|I KNEW all those years of hard-core video game playing would be worth it in the end. It turns out that the world as we know it is actually a super-realistic online computer game and I HAVE THE BEST CHARACTER!!! Not only that, but my video-game playing prowess impresses the ladies so much so that super-models fall hopelessly in love with me after only just meeting me! <br />Life is good.<br />As you may have already guessed I don't find the premise of this movie particulary original or thought-provoking. Sorry, but using your computer-hacking skills to kill twenty or thirty innocent security guards doesn't make you a hero in my book, no matter how cool you look doing it. The acting stinks, and its obvious that the plot's only purpose in this movie is to loosely connect the really cool fight scenes, which are easily the most original part of the movie. Still, while the superhuman leaping and springing were a fresh look two years ago, the technique has become SO overdone in action movies lately that it no longer impresses but rather annoys. I'd MUCH rather see a real martial arts expert show off his (or her) stuff than some CGI-enhanced pretty-boy attached to wires, but maybe that's just me.<br />Anyway, it's a decent action flick and worth watching, but ceratinly not the be-all and end-all of the genre.
0525945636|5.0|This is a wonderful book, a real page turner. I just couldn't put it down, and if I didn't need any sleep at all, I could have read it all at once. I know some readers have mentioned some discrepancies and while all that may be true, don't let it deter you from trying this book! I am looking for more books by Mr. Follett, now that I have discovered him.
B000002GK1|5.0|The perfect progression from Louder than love. Grunge metal at it's finest.My perferred album over the more polished, more commercial sounding Superunknown. From songs such as jesus christ pose with it's amazing guitar riff and Chris Cornells truly awesome voice. To the short sharp rock of drawing flies. Finally finishing with the wailling masterpiece that is new damage. It is simply the best grunge metal band of the nineties, at there peak.
0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin has not made himself the king of fantasy.  This is by far one of, if not the best series I have ever read.  If you finish A Clash of Kings thinking you have some idea of what is going to happen, forget it.  Martin totally astonishes in this chapter of his saga, throwing in twists so great that it will either make you want to throw the book across the room in frustratio, but then pick it two seconds later and glue your face to the pages once again.  This nearly happened to me at one point.  He made me realize how much a reader can actually care for fantasy characters.  I will give one warning about this book though:  Once you finish you will not want it to stop, but of coarse we will have to wait.  Besides the wait until A Dance With Dragons, do not hesitate to read this book.
B000002A3T|2.0|and NOT wasted my money on it. It did not disappoint me, however, since I was not expecting much. PF without Waters is simply not PF, period. This CD is a snooze...with no songs deserving a second listen. With Waters, the songs are lyrical and most of them melodical. Without Waters, the songs just wander on and on without direction.
0441172717|4.0|Arrakis is a hot and dry place.  A place that is full of death and deceit.  It is a perfect place for an exciting story to take shape and to enthrall its audience. Frank Herbert's book about Arrakis (Dune), is a great science fiction story.  There never seems to be a dull moment while the reader is taken away to this desolate place.  The book is entertaining from cover to cover. The book does have a few downfalls though.  For one thing, the characters that appear in this story are often hard to follow.  The characters seem to jump in and out of the story line and it is hard to keep track of exactly what the character's part in the story is.  Another downfall is that the author seems to spend too much time trying to draw a mentsl image for his audience.  For example, when the author explains a certain character, he tells his reader everything and more about the character and it gets pretty boring.  I seemed to lose concentration when I was reading those boring details and explanations the author provides. Overall though, the book is fun.  It is very suspenseful with, something new happening around every sand dune.  I highly recommend this books to people who read science fiction.  It is a classic.
B000056VIY|4.0|From the beat catching LOVE DON'T COST A THING to a soft sultry, almost Janet sounding voice on &quot;Secretly&quot;, I am really feeling this various tempo CD by J-LO. It would not cost a thing to give this cd a try. Although, studio enhanced, it has some enjoyable moments with &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;, the infectious &quot;Carino&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright&quot;.  I know I am alright owning this one. Even Janet conceeded to liking Secretly in the latest issue of Vibe magazine.
B000009EHU|4.0|What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said before.  I finally managed to get a copy of the 25th anniversary edition and sat down to watch it once more.  Was I scared?  Somewhat but having grown older and wiser I now looked past the surface of this film.  First of all, people have failed to notice a lot of the black humour in this film.  All the lude remarks made by little Regan during the exorcism to the Priests is rather funny.  There is no doubt some of the visuals in this film will haunt you especially if you live in a house which has a second floor.  This is the beauty of this film that it takes place in such an ordinary setting where millions live thus giving the impression, it can happen to you.  The pacing also works well though after a few viewings it does get boring.  Some of the scenes are simply too short and the transition from one scenario to another isn't always that smooth.  For example we barely get past Regan's birthday and then all of a sudden twenty short scenes later Regan's mother is begging the priest for an exercism.  And please folks, how does a little girl manage to twist the head of a fully grown man and then toss him out the window?  Why didn't they show us that scene which really would have displayed the demon rather then do the whole thing off screen?  Basically there are very few shock scenes in this film, the masturbation scene and the exorcism itself being formost.  The movie is disturbing and one who is quite religious will find it even more so.  However that seventies feel to it is quite evident and I'm afraid as time goes on it wont age well.  As for the documentry that comes along with this edition it was a let down.  I expected a full account concerning the true story that this film is based on as well as footage from movie goers coming out of the theaters back in 73 when this was first shown.  Lets see actual people confessing to passing out and throwing up.  The things the featurette does show is stuff onecan find on the net regarding production and how they used slings and such for the bed thumping scenes and so forth; believe me it was nothing earthshattering.  The best part of this special edition is the movie trailor that comes with it; 3 in fact and they all manage to scare you.  Its a classic no doubt about it and well done for its time but it has gotten old as well and movie goers have also gotten more sophisticated.  Certainly its one of the most controversial films to be made but I think the scariest film for me is &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;  At any event this film does belong in every true horror fan's collection but you will catch yourself laughing at it more then anything by the fifth or sixth viewing if not sooner.  Highly recommended.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|With Brave New World Iron Maiden has succeded in what they had struggled to accomplish throughout the '90s.  They have manageg to incorporate the elements of their classic albums from the '80s into one near perfect album.  There is not one bad song on this CD.  There are heavy songs like &quot;The Nomad&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, progressive songs like &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and some very catchy melodic compositions as well such as the single &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.  This album is classic Maiden, yet it still sounds original.  The band has managed to avoid repeating itself after 20 years.  Adrian Smith's guitar work is amazing, and has a much more spontaneous feel than a lot of his playing.  The riffs are excellent too, featuring Iron Maiden's classic dual guitar harmonies whith the third guitar filling out the rhythm parts.  Bruce Dickinson is back in top form obiviously, and his awesome voice hasn't aged a bit.  Nicko's drumming is excellent.  He is definitely one of the most underrated drummers in rock, playing his drums almost like a lead instrument, thanks to his amazing double bass drum techinque.  And Steve Harris is... well he's STEVE HARRIS DUDE!  This guy is one of the best songwriters of his generation and while some may laugh at that it's pretty hard to deny.  This is the man responsible for some of the greatest metal anthems of the last 20 years, and his songwriting on this album is no exception (Many of the songs were also cowritten by Bruce Janick Dave and Adrian.) Bottom line:  You will not be dissapointed.  If you were let down by the mediocre Blaze Bailey era albums of the late '90s this is the antidote.  Up the Irons.
0784011176|5.0|People seem to either love or hate this film, which is understandable because it wants to be approached on an emotional level more than an intellectual one. My boyfriend complained that none of the characters were compelling enough to care about, whereas I could see that the central character is, indeed, the piano and how everything revolves around its voice -- Ada's voice. Listening to her voice, being moved by it, is the key to the entire film.<br />One of the several engaging themes is that of who is on center stage at any given time. Count the number of times someone is watching someone else: Baines watching Ada play her piano on the beach, actors in a play looking through curtain eyeholes at the audience, the natives in the audience watching the play and believing the actors to be &quot;real&quot;, Stewart looking through gaps in the planks to see his wife with another man, Flora watching Stewart attempt to destroy his wife's voice. (Interestingly, this is an assault not on the piano itself but on something more fundamental. And those who believe that Ada's gift of the piano key to Baines is a major faux pas perhaps don't realize that he will know exactly what that white key means though he can't read the words burned into it.)<br />The disturbing moments, and there are several, are entirely about the piano's (Ada's) voice and how these men attempt to either restrict or manipulate it to get what they want -- one endangering her sense of self while simultaneously using and liberating her, the other denying her self-expression while trying to be her protector and &quot;a good man&quot;.<br />It's a very fine movie for those of a mind to listen.
B000002H3E|4.0|It starts out mysteriously enough with &quot;Unchain The Night&quot;, which is a decent song that takes a while to build up.  But this CD really comes together with the blistering yet commercially accessible &quot;The Hunter,&quot; which has one of the best intros of any heavy metal song I've ever heard.<br />In fact, the phrase &quot;blistering yet commercially accessible&quot; would be a good way to describe Dokken's music in general.  George Lynch's fully three-dimensional guitar artistry blends effortlessly with Don Dokken's pop sensibility in his songwriting, as well as his melodic singing, to create a unique sound that is all Dokken's.  Their sound is easily recognisable, right off the first silky chords provided by Mr Lynch to the piledriver rhythm section provided by Messrs. Pilsson and Brown.  In fact, I think that Jeff Pilsson is one of the greatest heavy metal bassists of all time.  No wonder why, when Dokken broke up, Michael Schenker snatched him up for the wonderful &quot;Schenker-McCauley&quot; album (1991).<br />Anyway, other standout tracks on this CD include &quot;In My Dreams&quot; (which is very catchy, full of hooks, and probably Dokken's most commercial song ever), &quot;It's Not Love,&quot; and &quot;Till The Livin' End&quot; (which is the most blistering track on this CD, and is one of their fastest songs ever).  Sure, this CD is more polished than &quot;Tooth And Nail&quot; but it will still rock your socks off!  If you love your '80's metal with a bit more artistry than other &quot;hair-metal&quot; bands, well then what are you waiting for??  I HIGHLY reccommend this CD!! :)
B000002H72|5.0|Wow!!  When i bought this album i just wanted it because it was cheap and it had debaser on it.  It's strage lyrics that on first listin don't seam to make sense, begin to after hearing it through.  This is a Must-Have album for any fan of the subpop music.
B00004YKUY|3.0|First off let me state that I have been a huge fan of Journey since the late 1970's early 1980's.  I have to say that Steve Perry has got to be the best male vocalist in rock music and the thought of a Journey album without him almost seems unnatural.  When I had first heard that Steve Perry had been replaced as the singer for Journey, I vowed never to buy another new Journey CD again. But after hearing several people compare the new singer to that of Steve Perry, I just had to hear what they could come up with.  Now while I have to say that the classic Journey sound is back (Escape and before), the truth is that something is missing.  The bands new Steve, while yes he does sound like Steve Perry at times, is not the dead ringer that I had heard about.  In fact, he sounds more like Steve Perry mixed with Dave Meniketti (of Y&amp;T), and Johnny Gioeli of Neal Schons Journey hiatus band Hardline.  While that combo isn't bad, it isn't what you've come to expect from Journey.  Where as Perry's voice always seemed smooth and natural no matter how he sang, Augeri's voice on the otherhand seems to range from smooth to screaming.  After listening to Arrival my only thoughts on Augeri's voical work are 1) what these songs would sound like if sung by Perry and 2)why is it that Augeri's vocals seemed to be drowned out by everything else.<br />As for the songwriting, Steve Perry's other major talent, the songs on Arrival again seem to be missing something.  While the music is fluid, the lyrics however are not.  A few of the songs seem like they could have used a little more time and a few more drafts.  As for standout songs, Arrival has a few, and I'd have to say that they are 'Higher Place,' 'Signs of Life,' 'Lifetime of Dreams,' and 'To be Alive Again.'  Of the 15 tracks on Arrival, those 4 seem to sound the most Journey.  Am I saying that you shouldn't buy Arrival, no, what I'm saying is that if you are a true Journey fan you'll like it however if you only liked Journey because of Steve Perry, than Arrival will disappoint.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Gosh, this film was bad. It was as if the actors were told to pour out their guts in wrenching circumstances for as long as they could without a script to keep them in line. The result, a long, long exercise in self pity &amp; depression.<br />Was anything good about it? Yes, I did like Jason Robards' &amp; Philip Seymour Hoffman's parts; played honestly without excessive blubbering. The rest of it should be locked and showed only as a penalty for moving violations.
B000059XUI|4.0|With the exception of the Tim Burton's Batman, this is the greatest superhero movie ever.  You can't beat it when a superhero has to face someone with the same powers as them.  And this movie has three people like that.  Of course I do have problems with how they kill off the characters which is why I have to take one star away from the overall rating.  Plus you also have the subplot of whether Clark wants to be with Lois or retain his superpowers.  The scene when Clark gets his powers back and goes back to the diner and beats that guys ass is so awesome.  You can just say that's guys in it now.  THAT'S IT I'M DONE!
B0000549B0|5.0|OK. First off this is not my typical brand of &quot;noir&quot;, there's no blood and even less sex. However, this film will always remain a classic, for me anyhow. I must of seen it at least a dozen times by now, yet, it alway is the stale bread toasted to freshness. It's a pure delight, light yes, still there's that undercurrent of reality, Mr. James pulls off so well. Also, unlike the bloody Wizarad of Oz (I know this is film blasphamy, to say anything against Oz.) I was was never disappointed as a child, this wasn't a dream. Hey its a sick violent world out there (thank god), still it's nice to have some simple smiles, pulled off your face in land far away. See you at the bar looking for my pooka. (sorry if I spelled that wronge). Also why does the DVD refer to Harvey as six feet, I believe Jimmmy was six-three and harvey is six foot seven. Just wondering.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This film is amazing when you begin to think that it is basically true.  This really happened to the writer/director Cameron Crowe. The characters in this film are probably the best developed ones, considering they don't say much.  The majority of their development occur through silent looks.  This is an amazing accomplishment in my eyes.  Check out the Tiny Dancer scene on the bus, this is one of the greatest uses of music in a film since the Wise Up scene in Magnolia.  This scene summaries the entire feel of the film, it's amazing.  Stillwater's music is awesome and has the classic feel that it needs.  Jason Lee and Billy Crudup are great in this film although they obviously try to hold back and not take for the main story.
0064407667|3.0|Lemony Snicket's childrens' books collectively entitled _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ have received a certain amount of notice.  I decided to give them a try.  The schtick is that the books all involve unpleasant things happening to our heroes, a virtuous and intelligent trio of siblings, and that the endings are all unhappy.  So it is with the first book, _The Bad Beginning_.<br />I admit to not being overwhelmed by the first book: I think it's the weakest of the series.  But it's still worth reading, and note that the succeeding books get quite a lot better.  I should add that my 11 year old daughter, after some hesitation (&quot;Why would I want to read books about terrible things happening to kids?&quot;) tried them, and has become quite addicted.<br />The book opens with the three children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, alone at the beach when they learn that their house has been burned down and their parents have died.  Things get worse as they are shuffled from the unpleasant home of their parents' executor, a banker named Poe, to the even more unpleasant home of their new guardian, a distant relative named Count Olaf.  The Count covets the considerable fortune which is held in trust for the children.  Eventually he concocts a diabolical scheme to gain control of the money, but at the last moment he is foiled (in a very unlikely fashion).  This sounds like a happy ending, but Snicket pastes on a bit of a downer at the end to keep to his promise.  <br />This book is interesting and a decent read, but in the end it was mostly gimmick.  The writing was funny in spots, but not quite funny enough, and a bit precious.  And the plotting wasn't really sufficiently inspired.  Moreover, I was not able to forget the implausibility of the whole setup -- which I think more inspiration in the writing and plotting might have managed.  Happily, the writing, at least, is better, funnier, archer, in the other books: or perhaps one simply becomes attuned to the voice.One of the great ongoing delights is the hints of his &quot;personal life&quot;, apparently at least as unhappy as that of the Baudelaire children, that the author insinuates into the books.  If _The Bad Beginning_ is not a complete success, it is an introduction to a so far quite satisfying series of stories.
B0000041TD|5.0|Von Karajan's recording of Puccini's La Boheme is probably the best all-around; sound, orchestra detail, structure, and magnificent singing, especially from Pavarotti and Freni.  Von Karajan's concept of the opera is grand, which isn't exactly to my taste.<br />I prefer the Beecham-Los Angeles-Bjorling for the conductor's lyrical concept.<br />Above both of them I love the Toscanini set with Albanese and Peerce with only passable sound.  It's a little wacko because you can hear Toscanini humming throughout!  But the conducting sears with throbbing vitality.  Albanese is superb.<br />You can't go wrong with either the von Karajan or Beecham sets but the Toscanini will be an acquired taste.
B000056NX5|4.0|I watched this on PBS last week also and was reminded of how much I loved this musical the first time it came out...all those years ago.  I don't recall ever having watched the movie but I do remember seeing the stage presentation in the '70s.  Seeing this version just reminded me of how much I loved the music. If one overlooks the costuming choices and the near lack of period costuming it's easy to focus on the music and, more importantly, the story.  I found myself wanting to know more about the period of time that Christ lived and all the forces that were in motion during His lifetime. Most importantly, with age comes much wisdom.  I've often wondered why Weber and Rice split. They were very good together.  Weber has since gone on to churning out pulp and Rice...well, if you like the older Elton John I guess you'll like the older Rice.  This revival is definitely worth a viewing. I'm so glad I did and will view it again and again in the future. The musical has certainly withstood the test of time. I hadn't realized how much I missed it until watching it last week.
0671027344|1.0|I did not like this book. It just wasnt my style, but thats just me.It was about a kid named charlie who wrote about his daily life. It tells the life of how high scool really is, abot relationships, and friends. The Author dosent hold back anything. I know of a lot of other people who like i, so if it sounds interesting to you, get it.
B000056N8X|4.0|Highlander: Endgame...a fitting title to end the grand series with. In this one we have our friend Connor MacLeod and the upstart Duncan MacLeod battling together to rid the world of the most powerful of Immortals, who also happened to be a druid. The relationship with Connor and Duncan is parallel to the one of Ramirez and Connor from the first film. Bruce Payne was delightfully evil as the villian Jakob Kell. The only thing this movie was lacking in, was the seemingly rushed ending...I thought that it could have been better, but perhaps they were pressed for time before the release.<br /> This two DVD set has some great features as well, the 'There Can Be Only One' game was amusing, and I had a bit of fun with that. Along with the character timeline, and the script to screen feature. The one feature that really struck me from this DVD that I wish more DVD's would do, was the early full-length cut of the film..with the poor sound and video quality.. It was refreshing to see the product before the polish, and see what the Director goes through in preparing that final edit for screen release. <br /> If you are a fan of either film making, or the Highlander series, I recommend you at least check out this 2 DVD set.

B00003CXGG|3.0|Jet Li was quite impressive as an action guy and Aaliyah is quite attractive but they just don't light up the screen together.  Their romance was too contrived.  Not too mention that the general plot was a stretch.<br />I had heard some negative comments about the soundtrack but I have to say that what I heard throughout the film was pretty good so i'll have to pick it up.<br />And there's a major difference between veteran actors and singers.  All you have to do is watch Isiah Washington's flawless performance and then look at Aaliyah and DMX.  It's night and day.  But I don't think that Isiah Wasington would be a very good musical artist.  So the moral of the story is stick to what you know best.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is the 2nd best CD I've heard. It is just behind Three Dollar Bill By Limp Bizkit. Tracks worth hearing: 1. Hot Dog 2. Full Nelson 3. Rollin' 4. Getcha Groove on 5. My Way 6. Take a look around 7. Boiler 8. My Generation
0783222955|4.0|When we read To Kill A Mockingbird in English I last year, I found it to be terrible.  However, maybe it was because I was being forced to read it and I hate being told what to do.  Maybe it was just Harper Lee's style of writing.  Maybe if I read it again after seeing the movie I would appreciate it.  Or maybe I really do just hate it.  But the movie is incredible.  Gregory Peck's Atticus is completely admirable, and Scout &amp; Boo Radley are two of the most innocent and adorable characters.  They're a trip, especially Scout!  The trial scene is absolutely moving and makes you want to stand up against the injustices of the world, and the scenes with hate crimes can be downright scary.  If you're like me and hated reading the book, RENT THE MOVIE.  It won't dissapoint.
0385495323|5.0|This book was far better than I imagined it would be.<br />Singh (the author) discusses the use/importance of code and cipher throught the ages by using historical events to illustrate the importance of secure communication. In several of his examples, security breaches affected the course of history (e.g. outcome of WWII; fate of Mary, Queen of Scots). <br />I'm not what you would call a &quot;math person.&quot; Regardless, I was still able to enjoy this book. Singh is wonderful at explaining complex processes in steps and illustrations we all can understand. For example, instead of launching into a discussion about the algorithms associated with authentication and encryption schemes, Singh first tells you to picture a metal box affixed with several locks. I found each of his examples are relevant, clever, and helpful.<br />For those in the security trade, this is an invaluable book, as it explains the &quot;why&quot; behind the &quot;how&quot; with regard to information security. (Ever wonder what RSA stands for? Thought about how our national standards for bit encryption came about? This book will explain.)<br />Highly recommended to security-saavy persons, puzzle lovers, or anyone interested in history. Excellent!
6301247485|1.0|I was incredibly disappointed with this version of The Great Gatsby.  My main qualm was that in the book, Nick Carraway was the narrator.  However they did not see reason to use a narrator with this version.  Unfortunately, we have then lost insight into Nick's character and some of the best parts of the book.  Instead of giving it a brilliant ending where Nick is supposed to say &quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past,&quot; we have a scene of flappers and &quot;Ain't We Got Fun&quot; as background music.  Exactly what were they trying to convey through that?  I feel they put too much emphasis and time into the parties where nothing of interest save for some dancing and pretty dresses happened.  There were also scenes which focused solely on Gatsby's possessions.  While it is important to know that he owns a lot of stuff and owns it all for Daisy, for God's sake put some TASTE into it!  Watching Mia Farrow throw a dozen multi-coloured shirts into the air and a set of brushes next to a half-eaten sandwhich with flies all over it is not my idea of good cinematography.  The acting was terrible in this, as well.  The one saving grace being perhaps Nick.  Mia Farrow simply portrayed Daisy as a dumb blonde but there's SO MUCH more to her we never learn.  Robert Redford's Gatsby, well nothing could really be said about it.  It wasn't Gatsby, it was Robert Redford PLAYING Gatsby.  Jordan Baker was absolutely detestable, and Tom Buchanan just irritated me to no end.  Stick with the A&amp;E version, far less offensive.
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson really made it big in England after the release of 'Notes from a Small Island', which, however isn't his best book. His best would be either 'The Lost Continent' or this book 'Neither Here Nor There'. I very rarely laugh out loud at TV shows or books. Only 'Frasier' on TV and Bill Bryson in books have this capacity to make me laugh relentlessly. 'Neither here Nor There' is Bryson's story of the reenactment of his student-day travels through Europe some twenty years later. He tries to visit all the places that he visited with Katz (yup, he appears in 'Walk in the Woods' too) in the seventies, as well as Norway to see the northern lights. Bryson's descriptions of situations are hilarious, primarily because he is just a normal guy and you can imagine yourself in the same situation, especially if you have visited any of the countries he visits, but even if you haven't, it is still a delight to read. Another great thing about Bill Bryson is that he is not afraid to be politically incorrect, calling France's population 'Insufferably French' to give just one example. He is also happy to insult a place if he feels it deserves it, something which other travel writers can seem reluctant to do. He of course balances out these criticisms with his entusiasm for so many places and you also learn many interesting facts from his stories such as Liechtenstein is the world's largest producer of sausage skins and dentures. Hands up who knew that!!! I can't even begin to do this book justice in my review, all I can say is buy Bill Bryson's books and I promise you will not be dissppointed, they are all a joy to read. Bill seems a lovely guy and, in his words, not mine, 'If he wishes to acknowledge this unsolicited endorsement with a set of luggage or a skiing holiday in the Rockies, let the record show that I am ready to accept it'!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|This cd is quite possibly the greatest cd I have ever listened to. I think it takes a few listens before you truly understand radiohead, and then this cd will blow you away. I literally had shivers at points of the cd. Radiohead had other cd's that were incredible, but did not keep the mood throughout the entire cd. Then Kid A came out. Kid A is like one long song, it can only be truly appreciated if you listen to the entire thing through. Even if youve never heard of Radiohead, this is a must have, you will love it.
014100018X|4.0|I read 'Chocolat' in light of all the recent publicity due to the release of the movie version and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Joanne Harris's descriptions are so vivid that the sights and sounds of the small French town of Lansquenet seem so real; you can almost taste the delicious chocolate creations that the central character, Vianne Rocher, makes. For descriptiveness, 'Chocolat' is second to none. Another interesting point about this book is that it was the first book I read in which the narrative switches between two people, that is to say that one chapter is written through the eyes of Vianne, while the next is written by the town's priest. This is an effective story-telling tecnique and is probably needed in order to reveal a few things about the character's feelings which may otherwise not have been expressed had it all been written through Viannes's eyes. However, the one drawback is that occasionally it can be a little confusing to be reading Vianne's narrative for quite a while and then abruptly switch to Reynaud's.  'Chocolat' doesn't have a huge deal of story, it is more just a slice of provincial French life centered on character development, society, description and, of course, chocolate!!! This can mean that you finish thinking 'Well what happened?' but this minor problem is balanced out by the warm-hearted delicious descriptions and depths of character. Read this with a box of delicious chocolate truffles!!!
B00005B1EX|5.0|One of the true pioneers of metal is back. Rob Halford proved he is back with &quot;Resurrection&quot;, and now his LIVE album (from the &quot;2000 Resurrection Tour&quot;) proves his glass shattering high pitched voice can still belt it out to the masses. 94 shows in 7 months and touring thru 20 different countries - Halford &amp; Co deliver the goods. Halford was so good that after he left the opening slot for Iron Maiden's &quot;Brave New World Tour&quot; this past summer, he went on to headline in other North &amp; South American cities, Europe &amp; Japan. Halford helped bring metal back into the new millenium with his 3 decades of material. From the opening track (&quot;Resurrection&quot; - listen to the crowd going nuts) to hard hitting Fight songs (best two are &quot;Into The Pit&quot; and &quot;Nailed To The Gun&quot;) to classic versions of Judas Priest (&quot;Beyond The Realms Of Death&quot;, &quot;Genocide&quot;, &quot;Tyrant&quot;, &quot;Stained Glass&quot; and &quot;Metal Gods&quot; to name a few)... the action is fast &amp; furious. Chlasciak &amp; Lachman are blindingly fast &amp; accurate on guitars, but I am always drawn to the drummer (Bobby Jarzombek) and he continues to amaze me. A choice set list of songs. Great sound production. Great fans supporting his tour. Plus 3 new studio tracks which follow in the same &quot;bang yer head here&quot; mentality. Excellent package and worthy of the purchase.
0767830555|5.0|This movie, after more than 20 years - still gives me the creeps.  De Niro, as the deranged taxi driver turned vigilante, makes you want to avoid taking a cab at all costs.<br />Jodie Foster plays the part of a pre-teen hooker with excellence.  Her character is sad and provides the only outlet of caring for De Niro.<br />Great bit parts are played by Albert Brooks and Cybill Shepard.<br />What really makes this movie so good is the use of odd camera angles and some very eerie saxophone music.  A great movie that triggers all of your senses.
B000056VIY|3.0|Jennifer Lopez entered the music biz in mid-1999 by releasing &quot;On The 6&quot; which was a sturdy start for her debut release. I'll admit, I purchased this album and didn't think it was half bad. In actually, I only bought it for pictures, but the music wasn't too corny to bump in tha ride. Now, it's 2001 and Lopez has released her repetitive and utterly annoying sophomore joint, &quot;J.Lo&quot;. With the same uninspired attempts to dig through her Latin roots which she never really had since she was born in the Bronx and speaks choppy and slurred Spanish. JLo's standout track would have to be the 1st single &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; with heartfelt as well as angry lyrics w/ an up-tempo beat. Other than that, if you're into bubble-gum pop and meaningless lyrics w/ put-together-in-5-minutes beats, this is YOUR album.
0783225792|5.0|Casino, while being eerily similar to Goodfellas, is a great mob movie.  Deniro, once again, is such an amzing actor and presence that you can't help but be in awe of him.  Pesci plays almost an identical character to the one in Goodfellas - except for a small change in accent.  However, this little guy is still one bad man!   I still believe that this is Sharon Stone's only good movie.  Ironically, she doesn't have to disrobe to earn that status.<br />The plot, like most mob movies, is easy to predict - but I don't care.  They could churn these out every year and I would still be there in the theater - aluminum bat in hand of course!
B000006XVO|5.0|This is one of the best heavy metal albums I've ever heard. Crimson Glory (CG) is a band that delivers the exact amount of energy and talent in each piece of this release. They play some kind of power metal, with progressive touches. Their style is very sheer. CG is probably influenced by Iron Maiden, but the influence is not so evident. They know how to combine an agressive sound with elegance, power, mistery and fine art.<br />Also, the production of this CD is almost perfect. Vocals are operatic, majestic and powerful. Voices are the main piece in this show, and they're very well integrated to the musical background. The singer (which is called &quot;Midnight&quot;) is capable of reaching the highest pitches, but his voice is also full of mistery and &quot;mass&quot; in the lowest tones. I'd say he's one of the best metal vocalist ever. In addition, guitars are clean and very well synchronized. The bass and the drums are perfect too.<br />This album and the one that follows (Transcendence) are their best works. If you like power metal or progressive rock, this one is for you. Though their sound is very different from other bands you may know, you won't be disappointed with CG. Highly recommended!
0790729725|5.0|Based on the true story of mob giant Henry Hill, Goodfellas is the best mob movie to come around since Godfather 2.  Scorsese is a master at this kind of movie.  The characters are riveting, the dialogue funny and clever, and there's plenty of good ol' fashioned whacking!<br />De Niro is such an amazing actor.  Even when he plays the bad guy - you want him to win!  Joe Pesci shines as the pyscho little guy with a huge chip on his shoulder.  If you like mob movies - all you need are Godfather 1 and 2, Casino, and Goodfellas.

0060278234|5.0|Garth Nix's amazing book Sabriel gave fantasy readers an exellent read when it was published a few years ago.  His newest novel, Lirael, is equally as exciting and compelling.   This book is something I would suggest for anyone, whether you are into fantasy/sci-fi or not.  It has a sense of realism rarely accomplished by writers in this genre.  While many writers would try to make the book more real by making the characters less mystical, with more obvious human characteristics, Garth Nix has given the characters a sense of reality by not making them seem childish, or funny, or trying to insert any modern-day phrases or practices. Overall, this is one of the best books I have read, and I look forward to the release of Abhorsen with great anticipation.  Congratulations to Garth Nix on this wonderful book!
B000002JS8|5.0|This album is a KILLER album, I must say that much to open this review.  I must also say that this was a Hell (no pun intended) of a way for Bon Scott to go with AC/DC.  There is not a single bad song on this album at all (with the possible exception of &quot;Love Hungry Man&quot;, which doesn't compare to the rest on the album).  It kicks off with &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, which everyone knows, and is certainly a great song, and an AWESOME way to kick off the album.  Next comes &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot;, which is one of my favorite songs on the album.  From there, on in, the whole album is pure gold.  &quot;Walk All Over You&quot; has a bit of a long opening, but in a little while, the song is so great that it doesn't even matter.  Then comes the very artful &quot;Touch Too Much&quot;, but my favorite cluster starts with &quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot; (my absolute favorite on this album), then the song &quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot;.  The former has killer opening guitar lick and awesome vocals by Bon Scott, and a great guitar solo by Angus.  &quot;Shot Down In Flames&quot; only proves you don't need a complicated guitar riff to make a Hell of a song.  The riff is awesome, but it probably isn't the hardest to play on guitar.  And Bon Scott's vocals on the song are extremely searing ones.  Then come &quot;Get It Hot&quot;, a short and sexy song.  It has a &quot;good ol' days&quot; feel to it, and AC/DC often brings that feeling back, it is basically what heavy metal would sound like in the 60's had it existed before Steppenwolf.  Then comes the raw and ravaging &quot;If You Want Blood&quot;, and there ends the cluster of songs that I adore about this album.  Bon Scott's vocals are raging, and so is the guitar riff.  Then comes &quot;Love Hungry Man&quot;, which is out of place on this album, and is probably more fitted on &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot;.  Then, the album concludes with the bluesy and evil-spirited &quot;Night Prowler&quot;, which supossedly influenced the infamous Night Stalker, but in fact is just about sneaking into a girlfriend's house while the parents are sleeping at night, or something like that.  Only shows how uptight the media is about this.<br />I cannot stress the quality of this album enough.  IT is an AWESOME album, and it is Bon Scott's goodbye to the music world, and this is one of the best goodbye's I know on an album.  This is when the LEGENDARY AC/DC died, but a whole new era of awesome songs emerged with lead singer Brian Johnson.<br />I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great heavy metal/rock and roll blend.  There is nothing about this album you wouldn't like then.  AC/DC prooved that rock doesn't have to be complicated, it's just about having fun... and this album proves it to the fullest.  Best AC/DC album ever, even Dirty Deeds, which was something I doubted.  But, it's true, in my opinion.  Buy it, AC/DC fans, you'll LOVE it!
B000002H33|5.0|I listen to this album more thatn anything in my collection. Every song is so complex and epic, its almost like 8 stairway to heavens.It contains Cliff Burtons finest hour, or six minutes, Orion.Which was played at Cliff's funeral.You can't call yourself a metal head without this album.
B0000024VP|5.0|There are apparently a number of CD's with the same title, different cover art and different selection. To add to the confusion, ...has moved this review from one recording to the other as these recordings to out of print.<br /><br />Despite the confusion of three different albums all with the same title, one is the REAL original Sunshine Superman as Donovan wrote it in 1965/66.<br /><br />A Masterpiece. Starts out with the funky rock title track. His girlfriend's long hair gets caughtup in the Ferris wheel. He moves on through ecstatic Fairy tales and various psychedelic visions; the hypnotic Queen Guinivere, in the royal Court of Arthur moves to the Trip where \\"the whole wide human race is taking far too much methadrine\\".  The weather changes and Donovan posits the paranoid \\"Season of the Witch\\" and then Flies Trans-love Airways (the Jefferson Airplane), who always \\"get's you there on time\\". (When he wrote this The Airplane was unrecorded and known only to undergrounders and the hippies in San Francisco.)<br /><br />This was a revolutionary, groundbreaking album in 1966, following on the heels of Bob Dylan's electric debut \\"Bringing it all Back Home\\". These albums (and others) changed Folk, Rock and Pop forever. See my list and my essay.<br /><br />Sunshine Superman is clearly the best, most coherent, most visionary album of Donovan's career.<br /><br />Newest releases (finally) capture the sound quality of the original LP.
B000000I3O|5.0|This album is unlike anything else, unless its by the misfits.Some of the versions of these songs aren't as good as others I've heard, like teenagers from mars.Its still interseting to hear different versions so buy this even if you already own most of the songs on their other albums.We are 138!
B000056NX4|5.0|This is the 3rd instalment to the universal spotlight collection and let me tell you it is also the best. In comparason to the first JC superstar filmed in the 70's, this verson holds true more to the spirt of the stage show. Not only that but it is just one of the best musical's ever writen by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. I also recomend the other two videos from the spotlight collection: Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream coat, staring Donny Osmond and Jone Collins, and Cats, staring Elaine Paige, Ken Page, and Sir. John Mills.
B000009QPG|5.0|While Seasons still contains the usual wicked-fast guitar riffs and out of control solos, they tone in down a bit on this album. The great thing about this album is it sets an atmosphere for the listener and takes you to the darkest and scariest regions of hell.All the songs lyrical content is amazing.Don't listen to the people who say not to take slayer's lyrics seiously.These are very deep lyrics that explore the dark side of mankind and take you on a journey.Enjoy all the elements of this great album and buy it today!
0684853523|4.0|I'll admit it: I'm not Stephen King's greatest fan. On Writing is only the second book I've read by him (the first being Rose Madder, many years ago), and I only picked it up because I was interested in what he had to say about the writing process. However, in regard to King's fiction writing skill, I never thought he was a bad author; in fact, among all the authors who show up on those tacky &quot;Bestsellers Shelves&quot; at grocery and convenience store racks, he is the one I would consider to be the most consistentely literate and skilled in his writing style. The horror genre is just one that happens to capture readers' attention and therefore sell more; therefore, I never really held his popular success against him as some snotty (in my opinion) literary critics do.<br />Whatever we learn from any writer, however, is most likely subjective and its value can be questioned. What do we want to learn from Stephen King? How to write just like him? Hopefully not, and he does not try to teach this. How to write horror stories? Maybe, but this is not all of what he teaches, or even most of it.<br />When it comes down to it, I picked the book up because I was interested in reading about King's life, as with any author's life; what makes a person a writer? What early experiences led them to want to write or know they were going to write? - writers and readers ask questions such as these about all writers. King did a great job, in my opinion, of sharing these thing with us. The first half in On Writing is an autobiography of sorts, but is more of what King subtitles his book, &quot;A Memory on the Craft&quot; than any kind of general life autobiography. Any aspiring (not to mention starving!) writer can sympathesize with King's early attempts of getting his short stories published in small magazines, and can empathesize with his living situations before he started making money from his writing. I found this half to be the most interesting of the book as it was a glimpseinto a famous author's life.<br />The second half is advice on writing. I liked much of it, and there are a few things that stick with me strongly a week or so after I put the book down for the last time. King's chastisement on those who use the passive voice, for instance, and his pet peeve- those who use adverbs too much in their dialogue in order to express the character's feelings (&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Jill pensively. &quot;Not what you think!&quot; yelled Joe excitedly - is one piece of such dialogue King would hate) are the two that come most readily to mind. As for his other advice... well, all writers are different, and I would admittedly probably take advice from a master like Faulkner much more readily and with less skepticism than I do that from King. The most annoying thing for me while reading On Writing was King's tendency to criticize other writers and books - even well-written and renowned books such as the Lord of the Flies! - in order to show a writer what not to do in her or his work. I feel this could have been expressed much more efficently - and ethically - with examples of King's own work, either published or unpublished, where he feels readers can learn from his mistakes. There is no need to put other authors down just to bulid oneself up. The best part of his writing advice for me was the nuts-and-bolts stuff: how to present a manuscript to a possible publisher, where to find markets, how to find the dedication to keep writing when one lacks the determination and inspiration, etc. Since King is obviously a successful writer - not only with his words but with his marketing skill - these are concrete pieces of advice to pass down to aspiring writers, unlike subjective comments about writing and authors.<br />Overall I think that On Writing delivers what it promises, which is a memoir of an author's life for his readers, as well as writing advice for aspiring writers. For this reason I recommend the vast majority of this smooth-flowing book to both readers and writers. Just watch out for the occasional bumpy spots along the way. ...
B000056K04|5.0|its true, its true...the sessions are gone and now we have this, this, a DMB truist &quot;let you down&quot;. BUT WAIT... as i heard Dave sing 'everyday' w/ trey in febuary, i changed my mind. Now DMB has 20(including the sessions of course) new songs to show case around the world live, and trust me as the band grows to know these songs these creations of David and Satan will become that 'angel' we have waiting for. While 'Grace is Gone'(for now) this album is one that will grow to be a fan favorite before it is all over. Not since i heard 'STAY' live at Jazz fest in '98 (w/o the lovely ladies) have i been so pumped to hear new DMB on the road.
B00004STPT|5.0|HAns Zimmer (who i believe should have won the oscar for this score) is a musical genius when it comes to putting music to the scenes to convey the emotions of the film. After watching the Rock, and hearing the fabulous score, i became an instant fan of Zimmer's and was not let down by this score. Fiove stars and much applause for this CD
0671027344|5.0|When, I saw the cover of the Book, I thought that it was going to be really boring, but when I started reading it, I thought that it was great. It's a book that talks about some of the problems that teenegers in High School have to face. Specially when there are lots of things going on, and a Freshmen student that it's srtugguling to fit into a world, it's a really, interesting book, that it can make you laugh, but at the same time, it can, make you cry. I thought that it was a really wonderful book, and I would recommend everyone else to read it, it is a very Dramatic book, which I'm sure you would all njoy it.
B000021XR5|5.0|This album is like a mix between the older grunge music STP did and the newer alternative that was experimented with on Tiny Music.  Just about every song mixes the two genres and the result is sweet.  My only complaint is the lyrics.  Seems that repeating the same line over and over doesn't hit me as hard as the poetic lines on songs like Adhesive or Pretty Penny.<br />Down-10/10-This is a hard rock track.  It sounds more like something from Purple, there's a sense of grunge in it.  You've heard this on the radio.  The lyrics are pretty basic stuff, but they hold their own. <br />Heaven and Hotrods 9/10-This is another great hard rock song, you start to see the lyric repitition in this one though.  Otherwise it's great.  <br />Pruno-9/10-ANOTHER hard rock song with a pinch of alternative thrown in.  There's some interesting riffing in this song.  The lyrics though are just bad.  &quot;One, two, three, I've got another, got another?&quot;.  Hmmm...<br />Church on Tuesday 8.5/10-I really like this song, it's like something from Tiny Music.  The lyrics are good, but there's something about the chorus that I just don't like.  <br />Sour Girl 9.5/10-This is unlike anything STP has done.  It was made for the radio, and you've definitely heard it.  It has a very relaxing atmosphere and tone.  The lyrics work well with that.  The guitar is really good too.  It's something different.<br />No Way Out 6.5/10-This song has potential during the verses.  You really get a throwback to Core, until the chorus.  Horrible music.  It sounds like one of the new hybrid rap rock bands.  Not what I want from a Stone Temple Pilots album.  <br />Sex and Violence 8.5/10-Another good hard rock song, but it sounds like it could be from Tiny Music.  The verses and pre chorus are excellent, but it's another lackluster chorus that sounds like a hybrid rap/rock band.  But the verses and pre-chorus are so damn good...<br />Glide 10/10-Something from Tiny Music again, something like Adhesive.  Beatiful music, lyrics, guitar, and vocals.  It just shows how much STP has grown.  I can't listen to Core anymore because this is so much better.  Songs like this just show you how much STP has shed its Pearl Jam clone label.  Excellent song.  I love the &quot;oh oh&quot; part right in the middle.  <br />I Got You 9.5/10-Something about this song reminds me of Nirvana.  Maybe it's the lyrics or the acoustic riff.  It changes in the chorus though, then it sounds like The Beatles or something.  Great song.  <br />MC5-9/10-Great hard rock track, like the first three.  Another case of lyric repitition here though.  I like the how the riff follos along with Scott's voice.  Great song.  <br />Atlanta 10/10-STP is a band that doesn't forsake it's closer.  This song does sound like the Doors, his voice could be confused with Jim Morrisson, but this song is awesome.  Has a nice dreamy atmosphere in it, more so than Sour Girl.  Some orchestra in there.  Good lyrics, great song.  <br />So that about concludes my review for No.4.  Another great piece of music from STP.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This record does not display any talent from Britney Spears. Poor vocal talent and what she sings about brings this record to the ground. In &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; (the song), she says &quot;I'm not that innocent.&quot; What is she trying to teach her 10-18 year old fans? That it's ok to have sex and play with mens hearts? Another example is &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.&quot; Between words, she puts a &quot;uh.&quot; Another thing that bothers me is her live performance and the way she dresses, but I won't get into that. Like I said before, she has poor vocal talent. Can't hit any notes. She tries to hold those long notes, but it just sounds like she's yelling instead of using her voice like Christina Aguilara does. Her songs take forever to end. You listen to the chorus about 6 times at the end before she finally shuts up. None of her songs are produced greatly, and it sounds like she just went into the recording studio and quickly sang her parts and didn't care what it sounded like. Her only talent is dancing, but just being a good dancer will not get her any farther into her career, it'll just bring her lower until no one talks about her again.
B00003CXMG|4.0|I am quite partial to films that have a historical background, whether the main story be fiction against a historical backdrop, or totally reality-based. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; falls into that second category with its engaging story about a boy who is smarter than his age who is given the chance to follow his favorite band on their tour through the country, finding out that there is more to rock-and-roll than just the money and the fame. The movie has a lot to say about this particular period in our country's history, taking us back in time to a place where happiness was achieved not solely through drugs and sexual practice, but also through bringing entertainment and joy into peoples' lives through music. The movie has a lot of sparkle and comedy to it, which makes it shine like no other film of this genre since &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; <br />The story is based on actual events of director Cameron Crowe's life, his interactions with a band just getting to know itself, and his own self-discovery as he becomes involved in more than he bargained for. The protagonist surrounded by all of this is William Miller, who lives with his mother and sister in San Diego. He was put in the first grade at the age of five, which makes him a senior at the age of fifteen. Without a father, his mother has become a control freak, dominating every aspect of her childrens' lives until his sister cannot take it anymore and leaves. This sets up the coming stages of William's life: he finds his sister's collection of record albums, which his mother describes as &quot;the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex,&quot; at which point the movie shoots ahead to his fifteenth year. <br />His introduction to the head of &quot;Creem&quot; magazine leads him to new heights: he is given an assigment to write a column about Black Sabbath, leading him to meet the band Stillwater as well as Penny Lane, part of a group of girls known as the Band Aids, who are basically groupies without that particular title. At this point in the film, William's character is seen in many different lights: he's vulnerable to the many degrading aspects that come along with the rock-n-role lifestyle, yet he is completely entranced by finally getting out and into the mix of it all, especially so close to the real action. Crowe is magnificent in bringing out his childish wonderment and awe, which will serve as the higher power for the rest of the film. <br />After receiving a call from Rolling Stone magazine, William is given the opportunity to travel across the country with the band in order to write a full-length article on them. His experiences with the band and their followers provide us with an in-depth look at the music as well as the complications and arguments that arise from its creation. The band brinks on falling apart at various points throughout the film, and it's interesting to see all of this play out onscreen. William is thrown into a mix of things he has never experienced: drugs, sex, music, parties, screaming fans, to mention a few. He never does any drugs, but his resistance to them sets him apart from the rest of the crowd, and his struggle to fit in with everyone becomes hindered. <br />From his first interactions with Penny Lane (which, by the way, is not her real name), he develops a deep interest in her, even though the feeling is not completely mutual. Penny is involved with Russell Hammond, the member of the band most focused on by William as well as the movie, and her relationship with him goes against everything she claims that the Band Aids stand for (&quot;Groupies sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. We're here because of the music&quot;). <br />And that's what the movie is really all about: showing us that people are not what they say they are, or what they appear to be. Everyone in this movie has, beneath their thin veneer, has a deeper human feeling, or something that they haven't shared right away. The band's discord is one such example of this: they have problems with Russell, who they think is taking away from their fame, and their proclamation that they care more for satisfying their fans is countered by these very arguments. Penny and Russell's relationship will reveal something much fuller about both of their characters, as they come to terms with what they have experienced and what they really want in life. <br />William's character is the most complex out of the group. His journey from a protective mother to the wilds and thrills of the rock scene becomes an engaging trip for the audience. His devotion to writing his article soon becomes less important, trading this plot point for William's coming-of-age in the midst of a revolution in musical history. He still retains his values and moral beliefs, and he even picks up new ones along the way. <br />Everything about this movie is fun and entertaining. It's got lots of elements at work in it: there's lots of loud music that has meaning, there's a human story behind that music, there's a little bit of romance, themes about friendship, loyalty and trust... do I need to go on? Everything here comes to life in this movie, whether it be the bright and airy attitudes embodied in the characters, or the delightful costumes and set pieces that bring the beginning of the 70's to life in vivid detail. There are bursts of comedy and deep thought that combine in bringing this era to life as well, keeping the movie entertaining and meaningful all at the same time. <br />Crowe also employs one of the best ensemble casts of 2000. Billy Crudup plays Russell Hammond deeply and with emotion, while Kate Hudson supplies cheeriness and bright wonderment to the movie. Frances McDormand is a nicely rendered controlling mother, while Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the voice of advice for William, who is portrayed exquisitely by newcomer Patrick Fugit. This is a dynamic collection of acting talent from all arenas, bringing a diversity and nostalgia to themovie that keeps it alive and frivolous. <br />&quot;Almost Famous&quot; bubbles over with the sheer joy and happiness that the era was filled with, and it succeeds in bringing that joy to life. It tells an involving story about a boy who sees more than most were ever able to, giving us a unique view of a unique group of people. Its ideas are in the right place, as are its messages and elements. I felt a great sense of exhilaration in watching this movie; it has a little magic in it for everyone to share.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Despite the number of reviews for this album already published on Amazon, I still feel compelled to comment.  The Clash's Sandinista, a TRIPLE album, stands among rock's few great sprawling messes of triumphant albums.  Even more schizophrenic than The White Album, Exile on Mainstreet, and Trout Mask Replica, Sandinista tears through nearly every genre of music that comes to mind.  What makes it great though is not the band's ability to assimilate other styles, but their wild sense of experimentation.  This is perhaps the only link to their reputation as a punk band.  As they take on disco, funk, tin pan alley pop, rock n' roll, reggae, jazz, and whatever else,  they handle it with their signature punk attitude, often mutating the music into something entirely new. Not every step on this album is successful, and there is inevitably a great deal of filler.  But every note is necessary,  the filler maintaining an epic sense of flow.  Nothing else in the Clash's catalogue remotely resembles this album, and Sandinista is hardly their crowning achievement.  Though it does remain a cornerstone of rock music and culture, and a great influence on the &quot;cut and paste,&quot; &quot;kitchen sink&quot; production of the contemporary underground.
0783226160|5.0|With that phrase, Mandy defines both Bluto and herself. In doing so she also defines the range of the movie. Immediately afterward, John &quot;Bluto&quot; Belushi smacks his over stuffed cheeks and sprays mashed potatos on his critics.  &quot;I'm a zit.  Get it?&quot;  This is followed by the classic food fight.<br />With such humor, how can one go wrong?  This appeals to the teenaged boy in everyone.<br />I first saw this film in a theater when newly released.  It had little publicity and I was one of only 10-12 people.  However, the story was so engaging and the 60s atmosphere (when I went to college) accurate enough that I brought a friend back the next week.  That time the theater was full.  Word-of-mouth had filled the place.  This is rare.  Usually a film arrives with ballyhoo and packed seats and slides down-hill from there.  Animal House only picked up steam as more people realized how much fun it was.<br />It's humor has permeated our culture.  Toga parties and road trips may not have been everyone's experience in the 60s but by the 80s Animal House alone had made them familiar to all.  In doing so it made John Belushi a star. There are plenty of familiar faces in this movie.  It's other stars did not  all rise to the level of Belushi, but you saw them for years and would say &quot;that's Otter!&quot; without having a clue who the actor was.  Many of the people in this film became type-cast.  For John Belushi it was a bonanza.  For the  others it may have been a disaser.  Who wants to  spend a career as &quot;Flounder&quot; or &quot;Pinto&quot;?  Yet that's pretty much what happened.<br />The film is not brilliant cinema.  It's not deep.  It's just fun. It unleashes the little  gremlins in all of us,  that little part of the psyche which says &quot;what I would REALLY like to do is...&quot;<br />My favorite scene is when the balladeer is strumming his  guitar on the stairs of the Delta House and singing to two adoring girls &quot;I gave my love a cherry&quot;.  Bluto grabs the guitar and smashes it.  How often have you wished to do that?  (What?  Never?  Then go back to Steel Magnolias and never mind.........)<br />This may have been National Lampoon's first foray into film and they were  wise enough to get young John Landis to make it.  Fresh from Kentucky Fried Movie, Landis  would peak (in my opinion) with Blues Brothers the following year. His other films have been a gradual descent from these early heights.<br />The  film also benefits from the writing of Doug Kenney and Harold Ramis.  Kenney died a few years later, shortly after helping Ramis write Caddy Shack, but Ramis became famous after writing and appearing in Ghostbusters as Egon Spengler.  His comedy writing talents helped create Stripes, Back To School, Groundhog  Day, Analyze This, and Bedazzled.<br />The &quot;free love&quot; and mayhem of Animal House may seem anachronistic in the 21st century but it is a valuable window into that generation of film makers, as well as the prior generation whom they portray.  The story is set in the 60s and is laced with the music and lifestyles of the time.  It is a reversal of the typical Hollywood &quot;morality play&quot; for the bad guys do get their just desserts, but the heros are, by current standards, degenerates, while the villians would  currently be considered upright citizens conforming to a 50s standard which was fading at the time of the story, but which (in some regards) has now made a resurgence in the form of rampant political correctness today.<br />Animal House is the antithesis  of political correctness.  If you've never seen it, it's a world expanding experience.  If you grew up with it, it's  just plain fun.  See it again.
0783222475|5.0|There are absolutly no flaws in this movie. According to another review the car drives over lava, the tires spin and the car escapes unharmed. NOT TRUE the car catches on fire and the tires are melted down to the rims. Great special fx. Some people think it is better than Volcano but Dante's Peak was better because Dante's Peak is a real volcano and the one in Los Angeles is not. Dante's Peak could really explode and the one in the movie Volcano could not. Just see it because when I saw it I thought it would be bad but it wasn't.
B00004YKUY|3.0|I must tell you, I was just as suprised when I first heard Steve A's vocals on the Armegeddon soundtrack and even more impressed when I listened to him in concert.  If you remove the Perry element, I mean really take his ability for what it is, there is true vocal talent. Be that as it may, I will always be a big fan of Steve P.  Yet when you listen to Perry lately, his technical vocal clarity have been so abused over the years.  This may be a blessing in disguise that he move aside for Steve A.  So, on with the review.  I've listened to Arrival for about 2 weeks now and it shows how long Jon, Ross, and Neil have been waiting for their moment to shine.  The sound is much more a group effort with no lyrical/overly melodic glop (Raised on Radio).  Everyone gets to show their stuff and there seems to be a &quot;back to their roots&quot; formula which seems to be the popular thing to do these days.  But is it for real?  For Jon and Neal, I think so.  They took out what they did wrong in Bad English by trying too hard to write radio friendly tunes (Diane Warren writing &quot;When I see you smile&quot; was a big loss of respect for me).  However, some overly produced tracks get in the way.  Track 2 makes me want to sway back and forth like I'm singing &quot;We are the World&quot;.  But I do applaud their efforts and think they feel good about their musical direction and that is essential.  Is it a fun album to listen to with only a few duds. Steve A. shows us he can perform with confidence, Jon and Neil are still focused on keeping the Journey sound in tact. Tracks 4, 5, 1, 6, and 11 are my favorites in that order.  Not nearly the best but worth getting used to.
B000002B7U|5.0|I think Ozzy is one of the maximum exponents of the hard rock on this days. The tracks are excelent and the melody is good also
B000002GH1|5.0|It has been a while since I last heard an album that was great all the way through.  I would consider this album a must have for anyone who takes music serious.  This was the first CD I ever purchased (it was a replacement for the cassett).  It is definetely a feel good album.  That is to say, you just feel good during and after every song.  As a favor to me and to yourself, buy this album.  You simply won't be dissapointed.
0529064847|2.0|Granted - this is the version forced into the lectionary of the Roman Catholic churches in the United States, but that is understandable considering the bishops held the copyright. I gave this a &quot;two&quot; rather than a &quot;one&quot; only because it is not so bad as a few popular bibles which are mere paraphrases.<br />Though the content is not inaccurate, it seems the authors were so desperately trying to be &quot;super-American&quot; that they translated passages into American slang, ironically not realising how that can vary according to region and era. For example, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, generations would have understood the word &quot;harlot,&quot; where &quot;loose women&quot; does not have the same accuracy.<br />For a contemporary, accurate version of the Bible, in non-slaughtered language, try the Revised English Bible.
0156347113|1.0|Now that the \\"century of the state\\" is over and done with, it's fun to look back on some of the century's larger errors.<br />One of the strangest was the \\"economist\\" (or whatever), Keynes. Although he said and thought almost nothing, for no easily guessable reason he got a huge amount of press mid-century. (Perhaps \\"Keynes\\" is a memorable name?)<br />Keynes is infamous for his spectacularly vacuous and callous remark: \\"oh well, we're all dead in the long run.\\"<br />By the time the immense suffering, poverty and horror caused by \\"Keynesian\\" (ie, socialist, money-spending) governments became obvious and undeniable, even to Keynes, Keynes was asked if had a shred of guilt or unrest that his pseudo-philosophy had caused so much poverty and pain to so many millions, that his very name was used to describe that type of \\"Keynesian\\" socio-economic system. His reply was \\"oh well...we're all dead in the long run.\\"<br />Oh well, Keynes is dead now, I suppose.<br />If you find it intriguing to read, say, Karl Marx (a bizarre figure associated with early socialism), by all means have a read of Keynes.<br />(All Keynes books are as odd, utterly unintelligible and utterly pointless as the other, so it doesn't really matter which one you have a look at.)
B000000OE7|5.0|Queen was one of the first bands I started to listen years ago, there are no words to describe what I feel when I hear them, it is fair to say this is one of the best bands ever, and what else is possible to say about Freddie Mercury?, this CD is a song to life. Every body in the world was sad when Freddie gone, but he left a precious treasure, his songs.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesday's With Morrie is a book I believe everyone should read.  Many people claim not to have enough time to read a book, but this book stresses the importance of time.  After reading this book I realized that I needed to slow down and decide where I should be putting the most of my time and effort into.  Although this book takes you on a journey through the last few months of a mans life, it's focus is not on death.  The focus is on living you life to the fullest extent.  When reading this book you see a truly optimistic view of a man that is on his death bed.  After reading this I can only hope to have half as much optimism as Morrie had.  The book Tuesdays With Morrie will expand and change anyone's thoughts on living and dying.
B000059QYB|5.0|hello!, well there are alot of so called(greatist hits) albums around, but not like this, if you lived through the 80s and you would know billy idol ruled with a iron fist,do not sit around and think about owning it, buy it!, i just saw him and steve in concert here in nj(trump marina, hotel/casino)on the 14 of this month, and he still has all the goods to back it up!, he will return to take over the one channel he put on the map(mtv), its a must have!, hands down!, nuff said.
B000002J29|5.0|This is certainly one of the best live albums of the 70's. It shows them just a couple of years after the departure of Peter Gabriel and features much of the Gabriel era material. Collins may be a technicaly better vocalist, (he handles the older songs very well here) but Gabirel's voice has much more character.<br />The rythmic aspects of the band stepped out in a big way after Peter left. Collins doesn't like to sing and drum at the same time and the edition of a secondary drummer not only gave Collins the freedom to be a frontman, but gave the long instrumental passages new life with two drummers that actually complimented each other. Chester Thompson, known mainly for his work with Weather Report is a remarkable drummer, but the band's first chioce for a touring drummer was Bill Bruford (King Crimson/Yes) who is featured here on &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;. I feel his unique style complimented the band more completely. Bruford didn't like the way he sounded playing with Genesis and left after the 76 tour. All that aside, &quot;Dance On a Volcano/Los Endos&quot; showcases some of the finest drum work you'll ever hear between Collins and Thompson My only minor complaint is the lack of a real piano. Banks uses the tinny sounding RMI electric here and it's no substitute for a Steinway. He would later use the Yamaha electric grand which was a huge improvement.<br />&quot;Seconds Out&quot; as well as &quot;Genesis Live&quot; from 1973 showcases the band during their greatest years before they became a boring hit making machine in the 80's. Highly recomended.
B00004YW6I|4.0|I decided to buy this cd on a whim when I was standing in Borders staring at it after hearing tons of good things about the album and the artist. I usually have to consider things very carefully before buying a new cd, and it usually turns out that the ones I buy on whims end up being my favorite cds.  PJ Harvey's &quot;Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea&quot; is no exception. I was truly satisfied with this album, although some of the songs are better than others. My favorites were Big Exit, The Whores Hustle and the Hustlers Whore, and We Float. I liked the other songs, but some of them sound the tiniest bit whiney--such as Horses in My Dreams and This Mess We're In. But I do think the album is worth it.... So, inconclusion, I highly recommend this album if you're willing to put upwith a few annoying songs, and definitely get it if you're a long-timefan. This was my first PJ album, and I would readily get another one.
0684853523|4.0|Another reviewer has commented that this book disappointed her.  She read this book wanting to know where King &quot;gets his ideas,&quot; and came away shaking her head that she hadn't been instantly transformed into a bestselling novelist.  Well, duh.<br />In &quot;On Writing,&quot; King tells us all that stuff about his life not just because it's fascinating (just as interesting as any of his novels, on a small, human scale), but to drive home the message of the second half of the book.  That section grows from the first into a treatise on becoming a brilliant novelist through sheer dedication and hard work, something that reviewer probably knows very little about if she's still looking for easy answers.<br />King has no magic formula to offer readers hoping to become the next...well... Stephen King.  But he's clearly dedicated to teaching by example, and his is a noble example indeed.  The sections on his returning to work after his near-fatal injury were both grisly in their detail and inspiring in their message of hope and strength.<br />King &quot;gets his ideas&quot; using the simple &quot;What if?&quot; formula that any decent writer turns to, whether their fiction is realistic, surrealistic, or anywhere in between.  It's what he does with the ideas once he's found them that sets him apart from the crowd.<br />This book is a fascinating peek behind the scenes for anyone who writes, or even anyone who reads.  The words on the pages don't just fall from heaven... King's memoir proves that, more likely, they've been dripped straight from the veins of hard-working blue collar authors who really care about their craft.
0385484518|5.0|This book is a best seller and  continues to stay on the best seller list because  in my opinion most people down deep understand the truth of Morrie's basic philosophy that people living exclusively  in a materialistic world generally do so to replace what they feel is missing from their lives even though they may not be consciously aware, at the moment, of what precisely is &quot;missing.&quot; What is missing ?  I found part of this answer in a general sense in this book. I  found even more precise and concrete answers in the book An Encounter With A Prophet. I highly recommend both of these books to anyone seeking to find out why they  seem to continue to feel something is missing from life.
6300184080|5.0|A magnificent and completely wonderful film based on the life of physically handicapped (only because society made him so) teen Rocky Dennis.<br />That's all the summary I'm going to give because this is such a magical film from start to finish that to say anything more may take away from a first time viewer the surprise and amazement that comes with each passing scene.<br />I will say this, though, this is one of those rare movies where the casting job was done flawlessly.  All the actors and actresses in this motion picture were born to play these roles.  Eric Stoltz (Rocky), Cher (Rusty) and Sam Elliot (Gar) were particularly outstanding.  Laura Dern also gives a brief, but very beautiful, performance as Rocky's very special love interest.<br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, PLEASE make it a point to do so as soon as possible.  I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
B000056VIY|1.0|HORRIBLE!  What a bad, bad, CD!  Horrible lyrics, horrible music, horrible voice...  It is very sad that they let people with such a voice release CDs and it is even more sad that people actually spend their money on it...it was a TOTAL waste.
B000007T1M|5.0|With melodies, lyrics and emotion that prove that at least some hard rock bands can be completely devoid of mooks (mooks like Fred Durst and nine ninths of Slipknot), SOAD are actually angry AT something.  Confronting suicide (Soil) in a way that does not make the girls swoon (ahem, &quot;P.Roach&quot;).  They also join the ranks of great protest songwriters with Politically Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers (P.L.U.C.K.), which brings to attention the Armenian genocide with all the venom of Edwin Starr's &quot;War&quot; or Barry McGuire's &quot;Eve of Destruction.&quot; There's too much to say about this CD in one writing... it takes many listens and a lot of reflection to truly appreciate it.
0385484518|3.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a book with a good story.  It is about a man name Morrie and one of his old students, Mitch.  Morrie had a disease called ALS, it was a slow and torterous death and no one should had to go through or see anyone go through this disease.      Morrie was an energtic man who loved to dance and go wild.  He was very dependant on his body to help him to these things.  While the disease kicked in, he lost his body in small portions which took his soul away a little at a time.    Even though he knew he was dying, he still talked to all his friends and family and said goodbye in his own special way.  The reason why it is called &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie,&quot; is because that is the day Mitch went and saw Morrie every week until his passing.      I wouldn't recommend this book unless you can discuss it with others.  That way if you couldn't figure out some of the things he said then others could help you figure out these things.  I read it with my College Communications class and some of the quotes he said were not clear to me, but other classmates knew and explained it to me.    This is a book to read with a group of people, young or old.

6302860253|3.0|Placido Domingo IS the Don Jose of his generation.  This was beautifully filmed and the vast majority of the cast can act...  Why, then, make such weak choices in direction and acting as far as Michaela is concerned?  Why make Don Jose and Carmen so god-awful unlikeable?  It is very difficult to be engaged in what is already a love story full of tension and jealousy when neither of the characters, as portrayed by the stars, are worth bothering with.  Domingo has played Jose in much more sympathetic fashion in other productions and this Carmen's acting ability should have enabled us to find her charms more than skin deep.  I own it, but I'm looking for a better version.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom is an awesome story.  It shows how the author dealt with real-life situations, mainly the dying of his mentor, a former college professor.  Morrie Schwartz not only teaches Mitch a few college courses, but life lessons as well.  Mitch enjoys his company and soon graduates from college.  Mitch moves on to the next step in his life and loses touch with Morrie.  March, 1995 arrives and Ted Koppel, from ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; brings the set to Morrie's house.  The anchor has come to interview this amazing man's fight to live.  Morrie explains what he has been doing to enjoy the last few months of his life.  When this interview airs, Mitch recognizes his mentor and decides to visit Morrie.  Mitch begins to visit Morrie every Tuesday.  They talk about everything, and it's almost as if he has joined Morrie for one final semester.  Morrie gives Mitch advice and continues to teach him things.  MItch stays with Morrie until his final breath.  This is a heartwarming story and can teach many lessons.  I give this book 5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this book to high school students and up.
0380796090|2.0|I bought this book based solely on the reviews I read on Amazon.  What a disappointment.  I love a good romance, but I think too many romance readers out there are too easily pleased.  As long as the author manages to string a few coherent sentences together, it's reviewed as &quot;THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!&quot; Maybe I'm too picky, but I know I'd certainly appreciate reading more critical reviews.   <br />That said, I want more from a book than one dimensional characters who seem to have only one genuine emotion --  lust.  This novel's heroine is beyond vapid -- she's stupid and annoying, and her love interest isn't much better.  I'm not going to re-summarize the plot since I'm sure another review already has.   Let's just say if you enjoy cotten candy, this book's for you.  If you're looking for something with more substance, I'd keep on searching. <br />Good luck!
B00003CXE6|4.0|well this was a good movie but it wasnt near as good as everyone was saying. I really just dont like movies that take place back in roman times, maybe its just me.  But if that doesnt bother you than you will love this one.
B0000214F2|4.0|I'm sure you know the plot by now, so i'll only mention other aspects of the movie.  This is a very Robin Williams-ish affair, in a sense, that whatever you expect him to do in this movie, chances are he'll do it.  Often predictable, though quite entertaining, this is feel good movie.  My advice to Robin Williams is to stick to the script of a movie (ie. Mrs Doubtfire) instead of adding in his own jokes (TOYS).  This movie seems to be a combination of those two.  The songs in this movie are all very manipulative.  Forget the fact that williams character is basically a complete nutcase (literally) happy/feel good music is playing so that means he's the good guy.  Good guy/bad guys are very clearly cut out.  I guess this is a family movie, but i'm not sure.  Anyways, I saw the thing and enjoyed it.  I hope you do too.

B000009ROK|5.0|He's Awesome!  I believe there's nothing more romantic than Spanish lyrics in the incredible voice of Luis Miguel. I've been a huge fan ever since I first heard his music about 6 years ago. The Romances set is the most beautiful thing you'll hear in a long,long time. Sorry Ricky Martin...Luis Miguel can REALLY sing!
6301963717|5.0|The Coen brothers are easily the best film makers working today, and with each new release they move closer to the top spot of all time.  Selecting a favorite from among the brothers' films is difficult, but if I were forced to choose it would have to be &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot;.  This film is superb in every respect - writing, direction, cinematography, even music.  The film's theme is honor among thieves, and the opening scene in which this theme is enunciated (&quot;if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?&quot;) is a classic.  The Coen brothers' genius in creating memorable characters is displayed throughout; each of the major characters is a delight to watch: the cynical (and devious) Tom Regan, the vampish (and devious) Verna, the treacherous (and devious) Bernie Birnbaum, the sentimental (and murderous) Leo, the philosophical (and murderous) Johnny Caspar, the sadistic (and murderous) Eddie Dane (you may start to notice a pattern or two emerging); and even minor characters, such as Frankie and Tic-Tac, are sharply drawn and brought vividly life.  And nobody writes better dialogue than the Coens (Tom: &quot;[Rug was] not a bad guy, if looks, brains, and personality don't count.&quot; Verna: &quot;You'd better hope they don't.&quot;) If one were so inclined, one might describe &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; as a post-modern exercise in cinematic revisionism, an ironic deconstruction of the traditional gangster film in which the Coen brothers take the elements of the genre and assemble them into a decontextualized parody which emphasizes surfaces and shapes: the fedoras, the cashmere overcoats and leather gloves, the smoking tommy guns with limitless magazines, the cigarette (no filters please) and the whisky bottles and the vintage autos.  But why would one want to do that?  The Coen brothers defy facile categorization of every kind and just continue producing one masterpiece after another.  &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is their best; don't miss it.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesday's with Morrie by Mitch Albom is a true story of a friendship that Mitch has with one of his college professor's, Morrie Schwartz. After Mitch graduates from college he loses contact with Morrie for 16 years. Until one day Mitch is watching T.V. and sees a Dateline interview with Morrie. Soon after Mitch returns to see Morrie. Mitch would come back every tuesday to talk with Morrie about numerous subjects. All these talks were actually a lesson that would eventually lead to the making of this book.     This book is very good. It gives you Morrie's opinion on many different subjects. This book makes you think, laugh, and sometimes feel sad. This is a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000003BEV|4.0|Most Rolling Stones fans consider this 1967 psychedelic experiment to be an abomination, a blemish on an otherwise respectable string of sixties albums. [....] True, &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; is a bit monotonous and doesn't really go anywhere, but &quot;Citadel&quot; is solid with a great Richards riff and &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; is as good as anything from Pink Floyd during this period. &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; was the single and is alot of fun to listen to all these years later. The album is far from awful, and yet not really a masterpiece either. Just accept it for what it is and take it in it's proper [...] context. Dig it, man!
0880389052|5.0|This book is the first of a series of Book which tell about the main character : Drizzt Do'Urden<br />A character that is so big that it is almost Forgotten Realm on its own. First novel of a series of 14 books with this Character<br />I read the books in a loop for 5 years now, and I can't get tired of them. They are great :o)<br />Sure there is better books to many levels, but none can be as good as my Homeland !
6304696566|5.0|The closing shot in this movie defines the career of one of the greatest American actors ever: Ethan Edwards (a Civil War veteran played by Wayne) rides up on horseback to deliver the kidnapped girl to her surviving relatives and walks off (the classic John Wayne walk) into the sunset as we are looking out through the door of the house. The only other career defining scene that even comes close is the final scene of \\"Dirty Harry\\" when Clint Eastwood asks, \\"Do ya feel lucky punk?\\" and blows the character played by Andy Robinson away. \\"The Searchers\\" is arguably the greatest western ever made. John Ford & John Wayne were as great a team as Scorcese/DeNiro. The photography throughout the movie is also unbeatable.
630439845X|5.0|What a triumphant piece of pure art ! Having always loved art  movies, The Piano impressed me at a very young age. I remember being in the 3d grade and not allowed to watch this movie. Now that I have seen it almost...I don't know...more than 10 times, I cannot forget this sensual movie experience. Gifted  actors like Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin lights up the screen in a perfect mother and daughter pair. Wonderful performance by Harvey Keitel ! Hunter and Paquin deserves every ounce of their Oscar gold ! The Piano is an undoubted winner and bound to be cherished by dozens of generations to come. This is and will forever be my favourite movie.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of the few rock bands I listen to. I don't know what is different about them, but they just force me to listen to them. Californication is full of light sounding tracks,  all of them really good, no bad one in the cd. The music mainly relaxes you, but there are some tracks that bring up other feelings.. It's hard to explain :) Just BUY THIS!<br />Favourite tracks of mine are 2, 4, 6, 7 and 15.. But others are great too!
B000002699|5.0|Miles Davis' 1969 masterpiece In A Silent Way remains one of the greatest albums ever made. There is a type of fiery beauty to the album that makes the listening experience both relaxing and intense. In A Silent Way is one of the first albums that could really be called fusion. Unlike most fusion recordings, however, In A Silent Way is true to the title; it is a very quiet album with incredible playing by th eentire band. The band on the album is extremlely great, with Dave Holland on bass, Josef Zawinul on electric piano, Tony Williams on drums, Wayne Shorter on tenor sax, John McLaughlin on electric guitar, Chick Corea on electric piano, Herbie Hancock on electric piano, and, of course, Miles Davis on trumpet. One of Miles' best bands since the first quintet with Coltrane. The album is a little under 40 minutes and only has two songs. Both songs are almost 20 minutes and are both brilliant. You really need to listen to this album to believe it. Essential to fans of jazz or rock and to fans of Miles or any of the other great artists on the album.
B00000JCB2|4.0|The title of my review tells my opinion the best. If you like this kind of music, the album is a sure choice. But I think I better warn you, you may get bored too quickly. All in all, all the tracks are alike. So if you've heard one, you know what the 13 (not intro and outro) are. If you think you can live with this :) go ahead and buy it. But after a month when you are so bored with it that you regret buying it, don't come to me whining.. :)
0451160916|4.0|Steven King's novel \\"The Shining,\\" delivers a bone-chilling ghost story in which a haunted hotel tests a families ability to overcome their past.  King utilizes the conventions of the ghost story genre in order to serve different thematic functions.<br />It is easy to read this novel on a purely dramatic level.  After all, \\"The Shining\\" is marketed as a book that is sure to \\"curl your hair and chill your blood.\\"  Although these promises of terror are fulfilled,  King provides many opportunities for the reader to delve deeper- to move beyond his dramatic choices and examine the thematic issues that haunt the characters in the novel.  <br />\\"The Shining\\" addresses the cyclical nature of history.  History never fades: it surrounds the characters, forms their identities, and shapes their behavior. Jack's past is plagued by alcoholism, violence, and the memories of an abusive, alcoholic father.  Wendy, Jack's wife, is desperately afraid of becoming her mother.  She has come close to leaving Jack because of his violent behavior, but has stuck with the marriage.  Clearly this is a family that has had a tragic and shaky past, but a past they have learned to survive thus far.  <br />In Chapter One, King sets up the concept of history as manipulatable.  Ullman is aware of Jack's violent past, and uses this knowledge to place him in a position of power over Jack.  History holds a certain power for every character in the novel, but it is a power that can be fatal if not used correctly. Danny's unique gift: the ability to \\"shine,\\" allows him to see events that have occurred in the past, and may occur in the future.  This power places Danny, at times, at a disadvantage because of his youth and inexperience.  Danny feels very alone, in that he cannot tell his parents about his visions, or his imaginary friend \\"Tony\\" who guides him through these glimpses into a possible future.  Upon finding the hotel scrapbook filled with scandalous information concerning the hotel's secret past,Jack feels empowered to use the information to write the great American novel. Jack is so involved in the hotel's history that his own past begins to resurface: his familiar twitch, his craving for alcohol, his violent behavior.  And what seems to be the catalyst for the resurfacing past?  The Overlook Hotel.  The very place Jack seeks comfort, focus, and isolation becomes his undoing.  The Overlook not only isolates the Torrance's from society, it strives to isolate them from each other.  The power of the family unit is thus tested.  When the Torrance's are separated, they are vulnerable to both the Overlook's past, and their own.   A recognition of the past is crucial for progression, yet this recognition can be abused (as in the situation with Ullman).  If repressed, the past will most definitely come back to haunt.  King inserts italicized phrases throughout the novel that function on a psychological level as indications of the repressed past, thoughts, or warnings.  When Jack \\"unknowingly\\" sets the timer ahead during Hatfield's speech, the results, on a thematic level, are profound. This repressed past resurfaces when Jack yells at Danny to stop stuttering.  The cyclical nature of history is also apparent in this novel's racial undertones.  Doc's race works, both for and against him when he tries overcoming the challenges that keep him from traveling to the Overlook. <br />  King structures this novel in five parts, referring to the Shakespearian Five Act Structure.  Is it no surprise then that King manipulates this historical structure in an unconventional manner, placing the Inciting incident in the third section and pairing the crisis and resolution in part five.  King transcends the ghost story genre to meet his own thematic needs.  The thematic levels that underlie King's dramatic choices make this novel more intense and real than any suspense story I have ever read.
B00004Z459|5.0|Couple of months ago Limp Bizkit was almost the only band I listened to. Then a friend of mine played me Linkin Park's In The End, and that's how I got addicted. Now Linkin Park is one of those few bands :) <br />Linkin Park's sound is different from other bands of the same style (eg. LB and Papa Roach). The singers are better, they don't yell and scream but really sing. Guitars are great. Maybe the best musical part of Linkin Park is the DJ. Machine made parts of the tracks bring a nice touch along with the guitars and drums. All in all, the sound is awesome. <br />I can't recommend this highly enough, you just have to get it if you like this kind of music even a little bit. <br />Usually in my reviews, I tell my favourite tracks in the end. But Hybrid Theory's all tracks are equally great, so I'll leave that undone. :D

B000056K04|1.0|After listening to a friend's discarded copy of this musical tripe I have decided to warn fellow Amazoners to stay away from this sap (or a word that rimes with SAP) The &quot;music&quot; within this CD is like a reading of James Joyce on acid; it just carries on with a mind numbing monotony which makes it impossible to go beyond a few seconds of each track. Have these guys had any lesson in theory &amp; composition? Likely not. Get some Valium if you want to be put to sleep safely; this DMB stuff probably causes brain damage, but it does put you to sleep.<br />Jorge
6305165912|4.0|This movie is freaking hilarious.  I'm suddenly a Jeff Bridges fan.  Plus, one scene takes place in Simi Valley, California, where I was born and raised.  How cool is that?  Did I mention that Jeff Bridges rocks in this movie?  I think I did, but whatever.  You mind if I burn a J?
B00000ILGB|5.0|This is the record I have been looking for my whole life.  It is an incredible mix that carries and ages well into its 30 plus years.  Makes most of the other music that is called psychedelic seem pretty lame by comparison, especially the one always held on a pillar, Pink Floyd, who seemed more concerned with making happy sounds without an ounce of tension to please headbangers, rather than in wearing their art on their shirtsleeve, as it were!<br />This is where it is at. The Whole Krautrock thing splintered into a few directions, and from my knowledge of it, Yeti is essential, along with Faust IV, Ege Bamyasi by Can, the first Kraftwerk record, and a few others.  Hopefully it remains available...
B000056K04|4.0|Yes, this album is different, the lyrics can't compare to the previous three albums, no long jam sessions, and it doesn't take advantage of the great muscianship that DMB has to offer.  However after listening to the Lillywhite session, this album definitely needed to be produced.  There are really only three good songs from the session: Grey Street, Big Eyed Fish and Bartender. It seemed very uninspired and stale. If it were released, it probably would have been a dud, unfortunately, and DMB would probably go the way of Pearl Jam.   As far as I'm concerned, Everyday is extremely listenable and pretty sweet. It's got some really catchy songs i.e. So Right, Dreams of our Fathers, Everyday, etc..  Although it seems that only 3/5 of the band is playing, DMB at 60% is hell of a lot better than 99.9% of the band that are out there.  People can complain about how this album isn't like the others, but change is inevitable.  DMB had to do something different, and it turned out they did what they needed to do: maintain their status as one of the most innovative, dynamic band in history.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I love loads of albums by loads of people (anything from beastie Boys to Jeff Buckley) but I suppose this album, along with Radiohead's 'The Bends' is the only one I could leave in my cd player for months and not complain. Anytime of the day or any mood I'm in - I can listen to this. I never tire of it.<br />I love every track on this album, even if in places it sounds a bit drolling or depressive, I never notice that. I disagree strongly when people say Radiohead are depressing - even my Mum thinks 'No surprises' just goes on in a 'depressing droll'<br />RUBBISH! All the tracks on here are beautiful, and perhaps it isn't quite as good as 1995's the Bends but that doesn't matter to me because I heard this album first and The Bends simply made me think 'wow! even better!'<br />After getting this (for reasons i couldn't even explain to myself - I knew very little of Radiohead, their songs, music anything) I immediately wanted all their other stuff. But I;m only 14 and don't get much pocket money so that had to wait, but I stress - if you buy this, you'd love the bends etc etc etc<br />YOU NEED THIS ALBUM it isn't just good, or even excellent...it's essential. Who knows maybe Radiohead don't have the masses of Britain on their side now (did they ever?), with people arguing over whether Kid A is too experimental, or old hat Kraftwerk or whoever did years ago which has been elaborated on by many other people for years, but this album was definately a very big peak in Rhead's career, even if it's not quite as good as 'The Bends', it's got a lot to say
B00003CXPD|5.0|I'm one of the few teenagers who was lucky enough to watch this really great movie.  Jamie Bell (besides being unbelievably adorable) does such a good job of portraying Billy that you'll be blown away. Its one of those feel good movies that makes you laugh (its actually very funny) and cry at the same time.  The music is great, the plot is simple but perfect for this setting, and the performaces were outstanding.  My only complaint...their accents cause you to use closed captioning to understand what their saying.  Please see the movie! jamie bell derserved an oscar nomination for this!
B00001SIES|3.0|I bought this album after hearing the singles 'sunburn', 'muscle museum' and 'unintended', all of which I had liked. I was aware that Muse were always being labelled Radiohead pretenders but I thought is that so bad? I mean, i love radiohead<br />I got the cd along with about 5 others and it kinda got forgotton. At last I gave it a few listens and thought the album was boring and bland - nothing comparing to the singles.So it got left to one side, but i came back to it a few months later and, after listening through it all, I did find a few tracks I liked. I think i went and gave it 4 stars at some website at the time, but it really only deserves three I can see now.<br />Muse are good in parts...but I wouldn't compare them so closely to Radiohead...they don't have that spark. Still this album is fun in places, but as their second album and everything is comin up in the United K now, from what I've heard I don't think they've moved on much or travelled down a different lane, as Radiohead did. Yes experimenting doesn't always work but churning about the same stuff, no matter how cute, gets tedious.<br />I'm really makin much sense here but I'd say, to sumarise...it's good, but not THAT good.Kay?
B00002MZ4W|3.0|I have much respect for Mr. Brion's numerous talents, but his production on this CD is too distracting and too similar to his work with Aimee Mann. This album sounds sooo glossed-over I could see the tacky surface sheen. Why?? Why not just let the lady's songs come through? Some embellishment is nice but please don't go crazy with the sound effects. They're not even amusing. Aimee Mann albums sound great, but 'When the Pawn...' is -too much-, the vocal is smothered, and it sounds like Jon Brion above all else. I hate that!<br />Fiona Apple herself is alright. I don't know what happened to her voice but her singing in Tidal was better. On this CD she groans a whole lot and pseudo-raps, usually to an annoying effect. The songs are ok. I can't help but think they are too structured, without room for anything more interesting. I don't know what the fuss is about the lyrics. They are pretentious but listenable. Actually I kind of like 'Paper Bag'. I think 'When the Pawn...' is a decent buy if you're into the usual slightly-above-average bitter angry girly breakup music. I wish I could say something more interesting about this album, but it's just not that kind of album.<br />Well, I do wish the Billie Holiday/Ella Fitzgerald comparisons would stop. They are laughable.
0783113943|5.0|Angelina Jolie gives a very, very good performance as Gia, the supermodel who lived fast and died young.  The supporting actors, especially Merdedes Ruel are also great.  The film is just altogether well done, with a great script, wonderful cinemaphotography, and a good directer.  Its a shame hollywood films can't look this good.<br />Even if you know nothing about Gia, watch this movie.  By the end of it you'll wish you knew more about her.

0451160916|4.0|The hotel is called the Overlook.  I'll explain the joke in a minute.<br />Stephen King--literary master?  Thematic genius?  No, no, stick with this review.  I swear, he is.  It is very easy to overlook the thematic depth to this novel--in fact, I would pose that he wrote this book as a suspense because, well, he's good at suspense, but also because we can easily ignore important clues when we are not aware of them.  Would you have read \\"The Shining\\" for literary themes unless someone told you to look for them?  Whatever, ....  <br />Jack, Wendy, and their son Danny are set to spend a winter and spring in The Overlook Hotel in remote Colorado as caretaker and family.  This family, though, has a complicated and dark history, a history about as dark and complicated as the hotel itself.  We understand, going into the hotel, that Jack is a troubled man, a recovering alcoholic still yearning for the drink with a violent temper.  Wendy lives in fear of becoming her mother.  And Danny&#8212;Danny possess a gift, a shining, kind of like ESP or second sight or sixth sense-ish stuff.  He can see dead people.  It&#8217;s not good.  Neither is the hotel; as its sordid history unfurls, the reader realizes that the Torrance family is a pawn.  The question is, does the pawn know about the game and can it win?<br />But the book is not thrills and chills, scares and dead bodies.  It is more complicated than that, but it an aspect that most people overlook (hint!).  King is speaking to the importance of history, the complex contexts that guide our lives&#8212;and the harmful implications of overlooking (hint!) that history.  Just like many people disregard a literary effort by King, so too can most reader fail too the complexity within this novel.  I must be frank&#8212;I did.  If I wasn&#8217;t taking an English lit class, I would have simply read this book as a scary, cool suspense novel.  I would not have seen the depth or the significance of the context and layers King deftly places in this book.  How easy we forget.  <br />Moreover, each character&#8217;s action is justified and valid.  This is a rich and justified character study; Jack, even when he is at his most crazed, still has elements of humanity that ground him in reasonability.  In other words, this book never spins to such an outlandish degree that we disregard the truth.  These characters could exist, they could be your neighbors.  And that is what the most successful element of suspense within this novel is&#8212;it is believable.  And in its believability, it gains a new level of tautness.  If these were chariactures, why would we care?  Also, the events are suspenseful on their own&#8212;Dick&#8217;s return is littered with mundane events that create a nail-biting effect.  King is the master of detail.  But you miss one&#8212;you&#8217;ve overlooked it all.<br />I highly recommend this novel--not only as a \\"don't read at bedtime\\" chiller, but as a strong exploration of Santayana's creed: the importance of understanding history or living with its ... consequences.
0393317552|3.0|I define &quot;liberal science&quot; as the prostitution of science to the service of political bias.  Diamond's book is the most edifying example I've found to date of this form of junk science.  Diamond crafts a tight argument by what he doesn't include as well as by what he packs into 500 pages.  He picks and chooses carefully among disciplines only for data that supports his premise: that Earth's varied environment had, over millenia, privleged whites and asians, but left all others holding dead tickets.  He goes to great pains to emphasize that environment had no evolutionary impact on intelligence (his underlying theme) and &quot;proves&quot; it with the most specious arm-waving anecdote imaginable. He doesn't return to this subject after that, and crucially,he ignores psychometric science entirely.  He must.  He ends many of his chapters with a self-congratulatory florish on how they explode &quot;white racist's&quot; beliefs. (In this book, a racist is anyone who believes that environment may have had an effect on the evolutionary rate of intelligence increase.) Diamond struts out geographic determinism as the sole cause for the way world history turned out-a bare-faced crime against open-minded science.  But it is his masterful manipulation of data from disperate sources that has given his book so many positive reviews.  I have been convinced by his argument that geography has a hand in the development of civilization.  But he demands that you believe it is the only hand: that 50,000 years in northern climes only gave W&amp;A better farm products but imposed exactly the same evolutionary pressure on the traits called intelligence and temperment as did the tropics, even though color and bone structure diverged; that civilization, itself a radically new environment we've been undergoing seletion in for 300 generations, hasn't placed even a smidgen of differing selection pressure on intelligence and temperment than did the forest. And if the reader doesn't swallow these remarkable coincidences,so amply supported by Diamond's adroitly culled data, this book, not too subtly, calls him a racist. This book is well worth a careful read.  From it one can learn many fascinating points from prehistory-I loved the explanation of the origin of the Samoans (but why was Diamond so lenient on them for destroying his favorite people-the New Guinea negritics). But remember that Diamond is on a political mission, and he is selectively using his extensive scientific background to make you believe that half of the story is the whole story.  What is needed, after this book, is a for a real scientist to write a critique pointing out all the data, the literature, the disciplines that Diamond saw fit to ignore in his quest for the Liberal grail.

B000002E5J|4.0|I was first introduced to Shakira's music by my aunt, the only person I know who's just as much a fan of latin music as I am.  I now have Pies Descalzos and MTV unplugged, and I love both each time I listen to them.  My music budget is pretty low, so I always appreciate it when I find a really good CD that is top rate from beginning to end.  Un Poco de Amor stood out, but I thought the whole thing was great.  It's worthwhile for anyone looking for music that you can listen to for years to come, especially when you're sick to death of all the BS (Britney Spears!) that plays on the radio these days.
0553106635|5.0|I think I already reviewed Storm of Swords, even before I was done with it. I tried the Terry Goodkind, and the Robert Jordans, but Martin has spoiled me. Charactors that are not carboard cut-outs, successes and failures of pro and ant-tagonists, everything a committed reader should demand are all here. I assume that if you are considering buynig this book, you have read the first two. If you are &quot;window shopping&quot; for a series-STOP! read all three. They are terrific.
B000002I25|5.0|&quot;The Doors&quot; is a stunning debut. Most other bands with strong first albums would go on to greater things, but sadly The Doors didn't. And come to think of it, neither, to me, did Hendrix, as &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; is my favorite studio album from him. Not a slander on his talent as much as a commentary on his too-short mismanaged career. Not every band can grow with each album like The Beatles--such was their achievement. But The Doors were not really a studio band. You had to see them live to &quot;get it.&quot; Same as The Grateful Dead; recordings and live tapes show two different ethics at work. (Before I continue: many Doors fans here would do well to know that &quot;comparisons are odious.&quot; The Doors weren't &quot;better&quot; than The Beatles; just different. Diversity in rock and roll should be applauded, not held up to ridicule. Plus, it hurts the feelings of Beatles fans. AMDG.) The strength of this album is, then, like Liszt's Sonata, that it shows the band in all of their all-too-fleeting glory--an epitome and a masterpiece. This album answers the question &quot;What were The Doors like?&quot; better than the remaining studio efforts, which all have their high points. But I don't think that a band of this nature could go on forever like The Stones. Strange music from a strange time, for sure, and we're all the wiser for it. Their records spin less frequently around my house these days, but I'm thankful for the lessons I've learned from them, and will never tire of telling tales from the weird old days of the '60s when music was made by men like Jim Morrison and The Doors.
B00003CXN4|5.0|CAN'T WAIT for this title to hit DVD. If you've seen and enjoyed Soderbergh's other stuff (Brockovich, sex lies and videotape, Limey, Kafka, etc.), it's a pretty good bet that &quot;Traffic&quot; will blow you away. It's a film people will remember 20 years from now, no doubt about it.

0671042858|5.0|Stephen King has been under fire of late by some of his so-called fans for daring to move away from his traditional style of writing and exploring new themes.  Books like &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; and this novel have received scathing reviews from &quot;veteran&quot; King readers, but I implore anyone who has not yet read one to do so before making up their mind.<br />&quot;The Girl Who...&quot; is a beautifully written, rite-of-passage novel detailing the exploits of 9 year old Trisha McFarland when she finds herself lost in the woods of Maine.  Trisha's odyssey begins when her divorcee mother takes Trisha and her brother for a hike through the woods.  However, mother and son's constant bickering soon becomes too much for her, and she momentarily steps off the trail to relieve both her bladder and her aching head.  Big mistake.  She soon finds herself lost and blundering deeper and deeper into the woods, stalked by something that may be the object of her imagination, or may not...<br />King so accurately describes the thoughts, fears and emotions of a 9 year old girl that one has to wonder if perhaps he might have been one in a former life.  There are times during the book when you think that if one more misfortune befalls Trisha, you might just give up and die yourself.  We feel her pain just as keenly as trisha herself.<br />There are people who have reviewed this book and complained about the baseball references.  However, they obviously do not see them for what they are; the means by which Trisha keeps herself sane.  Her precious walkman and the Sox games are her only link to the civilised world while she stumbles through the wilderness.<br />Please do not let the prospect of baseball references turn you away from reading this book.  They are few and far between, and easily understood, even if you've never seen or played baseball in your life.
630575067X|5.0|Many people may have disliked THE PHANTOM MENACE because it was not made in the 70s or 80s and it didn't have Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Lia. Well, duh...they weren't even born yet in this episode! And Darth Vader didn't exist, either. But this movie is just as excellent as the last three...just different.<br />I think everybody has seen THE PHANTOM MENACE and knows what it's about so I don't really have to write a summary. But in THE PHANTOM MENACE, there are some interesting and new characters such as the young future-to-be Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), JarJar Binks, Anakin's mother Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August), Qui-Gonn Jonn (Liam Neeson), Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and Darth Maul (Ray Park), along with many other new characters.<br />THE PHANTOM MENACE was aiming more toward Anakin Skywalker's point of view. The special effects and sound effects are incredible. The storyline is pretty good, too. Even though this movie is very long, it is a very good long movie that will have you engrossed until the end. This isn't just for STAR WARS fans - though I do say I am a STAR WARS fan - this movie can be for anybody. Of course, it would be better to watch the other episodes so you know what's supposed to be happening and you are not totally clueless about everything.<br />George Lucas did an amazing job with THE PHANTOM MENACE and I congratulate him on a job-well-done. It is a satisfying movie with excellent and surpurb acting from the entire cast essemble. It is a definite must see and must own for all STAR WARS fans and a great movie for just about anyone to see. Go and see this movie and I can guarentee you'll love it. Can't wait for Episode II out in theaters summer of 2002!
0385484518|5.0|I enjoyed everything from the title to the word for word content in 'Teusdays With Morrie'.  Reading this book is one of the most heart touching experiences you can achieve. You can actually feel with the characters; there troubled times and the good times they have shared together. This book on another level was also very informing, it gets you in tune with the disease ALS and makes you understand it. Morries philosophies and thoughts are also eye openers to life. His philosophies make you think and lok at life in a whole new way as well as see how he copes. I think 'Tuesdays With Morrie' should be experienced by all.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink's CAN'T TAKE ME HOME is an awesome album. I absolutely love it. With songs like the smash hits &quot;There You Go&quot;, &quot;Most Girls&quot;, and &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot;...how COULD you go wrong? This gal has got some attitude added in with a little funk. Every song is cool and real. Pink is gonna be the next big Diva, that's all I have to say about it. And sure, some people may think she has too much attitude, but that's all in her songs. I'm sure she's not really all attitude as a person! So lighten up, peoples! This album is wicked cool and you definitely have to get it. Buy it and you won't regret it. If you already like her singles, then you can be pretty sure you'll enjoy the rest of her album, too. This is one of the best Pop and R&amp;B albums out there right now. Go buy it!
0385484518|5.0|i was skepticle about reading this book, but as time went on i was entraped in it's story.  a man about to cross death's thresh-hold was about to reveal his secrets of life.  not only that but he rediscovers a wonderful friendship with a former student and author of this book.         one thing that sticks out in my mind and makes this a great book is Morrie's bluntness about everything.  he was not scared or ashamed of anything he had to say.  in fact everything he said had a specific point he wanted readers to understand.        Morrie's &quot;down to earth&quot; nature is something else i found unique about him.  he was always calm and never let little things get to him.  he accepted things as the came to him.        Mitch (his former student) finds a new respect for life as Morrie teaches him his &quot;final lesson&quot;.  his writing style is simple reading, but never loses its initial focus.        everyone has something to learn from this book.  from love to hatred, life to death, this is a must read.  this story truly teaches lifes greatest lesson.
B00003CXPC|5.0|BILLY ELLIOT is a wonderful film. It is a sure-to-be classic about a young boy, Billy Elliot (newcomer, Jamie Bell), who dreams of becoming a dancer even though his father forbides it because dancing is something that &quot;real men&quot; do not do and it's only for girls.<br />Every single part of this movie is excellent and there is no boring or dull moment. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless with a great storyline and amazing screenplay. The choreography is above all, one of the best parts of the entire film. Jamie Bell and Julie Walters, who plays the kind but strict dance teacher who urges Billy to dance, are the true stand-out actors in this film.<br />BILLY ELLIOT is a heartwarming tale and can be tear-jerky at times, too. One of the best sceens is when Billy shows his father how well he can dance when he dances in that room (I forget where they are), and his father is watching him with tears in his eyes. Another one of my favorite sceens is when Billy is dancing down the street.<br />This is a movie that should be treasured because it is a pure masterpiece. BILLY ELLIOT is one of my favorite films of all time and I really recommend this. Another one of my favorite films of 2000 that I also recommend while buying BILLY ELLIOT is ALMOST FAMOUS. Two really terrific movies and two of the best ever made. Go rent or buy BILLY ELLIOT and I know you will not regret it!
B000056VIY|4.0|This is a great second release for Jennifer Lopez.  It was obviously very well produced.  Quality arrangement of songs, you can listen to every song with out skipping through to your favorites.  Quality and arrangement resemble a Janet Jackson album.  I love the releases on the radio, but I got much more from the entire album.<br />This CD is not just for the MTV generation.  The Latin influence makes for a great collection of songs.  Highly recommended for the X generation and baby boomers too.  Way to go J.Lo<br />-San Francisco, CA
6304030959|5.0|JUMANJI is one of the best computerized special effects movies out there. It's a Family Classic and based on the childrens' storybook JUMANJI. Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, and Kirsten Dunst are awesome.<br />JUMANJI is basically about a boy, Alan, and a girl, Sarah, who start playing this mysterious, enchanting old board game Alan found at a construction site during the late 60s. When Alan rolls the dice, he gets sucked into the board game's jungle and has to stay there until somebody rolls a five or an eight. The girl Sarah gets chased away by a bunch of bats who appeared when she rolled the dice.<br />Now, twenty-six years late, another boy, Peter (Bradley Pierce), and his sister, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), move into the same house that the boy Alan Parish lived in. They find the board game one morning in the house and begin to play it. To make all the animals and jungle plants go away, they have to finish the board game. At one point, Peter rolls the dice and out pops Alan Parish - who is all grown up (Robin Williams), as well as a lion! In order to continue the game, the three go out on a &quot;search&quot; to find Sarah, who is too grown up (Bonnie Hunt). Everytime they roll the dice something bad happens to them: There's once a stampeed, a monsoon (the monsoon is my favorite sceen), and even a hunter who tries to kill Alan!<br />This movie is hilarious as well as charming and heartwarming. It is a divine film and a great movie for all ages. It's full of adventure and action, too. And even some romance. It has something for everybody. The acting is flawless, too. JUMANJI is definitely a must own to your Family Classics collection!
B000000OAC|5.0|Compared to its predecessor &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;  this album is much heavier and straighter. Some people say Queen went punk thinking of &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; . I have to contradict them. It`s just one song. Pondering on &quot;News of the World&quot; I first get the classical hard rock tunes in my mind &quot;We will rock you, It`s late&quot;.<br />Unusual for Queen there`s some R&amp;B as well: Sleeping on the sidewalk; My melancholy blues.The former is about the ups and downs of Show Business. The way Mercury stresses some words and uses some terms makes the listener believe that he is an American singer.<br />The Album also contains strange &quot;underground&quot; tunes  &quot; Fight from the inside; Get down make love&quot; and a weird ballad &quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot; .<br />&quot;News of the World&quot; has the same strength as &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; without any baroque sounds.<br />A Timeless , Down to Earth  Hard Rock Disc!
0792844882|5.0|&quot;Showgirls,&quot; the abundantly enthusiastic, if wayward and offbeat, retelling of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; sends brilliant Speedcolor visuals that expound the demurral hunch &quot;Is the arrival actually the departure?&quot; Elizabeth Berkley drives home a stunning protaganist version in the spirit of Turu Satana (Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill!), in which martials arts is briefly incorporated to destruct the corporeal patriarchal beast that could possibly and secretly loom inside every showboater from Yanni to Seigfried &amp; Roy. The misogynist is destroyed, his spirit devastated. Shrewdly discounted by shallow critics, this Dickensian toned mythology yanks the hemlock away and liberates the prisoner. Increased libidin et alius is acheived since we see frequent and generous sights of Ms. Berkley oh so naked! &quot;Showgirls&quot; ranks as an important contribution to Cardonic cinema.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I love this cd.  I was hesitant about buying it because some of the songs I heard were blah.  But listening to the whole cd suprised me.   I love Rammstein and have ALL their albums.  I was really happy w/ this cd.
0783241038|5.0|As a closet purist 60's Trekkie - I rolled my eyes when I &quot;had&quot; to watch this movie on a long plane trip home.  I giggled all the way through it and it made the flight go a lot faster!  There are so many things you miss if you just watch it once, kind of like a Mel Brooks movie.  So I had to buy it.  I just saw it again yesterday and chuckled some more.<br />There is one fellow in the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; cast - Guy something (he doesn't have a role important enough to rate a last name) who just KNOWS he's expendable and will be the first to die.  Sigourney Weaver has the funniest line in the movie:  &quot;Oh my God!  Let's get out of here before they kill Guy!&quot;<br />This is a funny and sweet movie.  Alan Rickman (my favorite actor - wait'll you see him!) steals every scene he's in.  But Tim Allen, Ms. Weaver, Tony Maloob and the rest of the cast are just as excellent.  The &quot;good&quot; aliens you pretty much want to cuddle.<br />I love this movie.
B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed's 1973 &quot;Berlin&quot; shows us an important lesson of art, often ignored and disregarded. Art does not have to be pretty but at times must be dark and cruel, in order to release certain emotions locked deep inside. Lou Reed can be terribly tedious at times but with &quot;Berlin&quot;, he gets it just right. With the help of Bob Ezrin, it has the grand style of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;(Which Ezrin later would produce) musically and Lou Reed happily supplies us with narrative lyrics of broken souls in dark alleys which we as a society do not like to regard. If you listen to &quot;Berlin&quot; and think these kind of people and situations don't exist, you don't know life. Lou Reed paints us the picture, doesn't comment and lets us be the judge in the end, as real art should do. There are moments like in &quot;The Kids&quot; where the record is really hard to listen to but then uplifting moments like &quot;Sad Song.&quot; I'd rather not go into detail of each song and let you discover them for yourself but will say that &quot;Berlin&quot; is the best thing Lou Reed did after The Velvet Underground and well worth your time and money.

He is a successful sports writer who gave up his musical dream for money.  Morrie is an old college professer who is dignosed with ALS.

B000009O8A|5.0|I Spit On Your Grave is one of the best of the genre that I have ever seen. This film has everything you come to expect from this sort of gem: violence, nudity, unintentional humor, a weak story line and graphic rape scenes to boot. <br />The look on the girl's face when she is attacking one of the guys with an axe is worth the price alone. (not to mention the &quot;tub&quot; scene) <br />This is a great flick you can watch over and over again. I highly recommend it. Also, if you haven't yet, pick up &quot;She Wolf of the SS&quot; More 5-star entertainment in this genre.

B00005ABX0|5.0|In the age of still putting a picture of the rock group on the front album cover, The Beach Boys released \\"Smiley Smile\\" with no picture of them on the front or back covers, then a few months later another album with no Beach Boys pictures on the front cover.<br /><br />In 1965, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys heard Rubber Soul, it made them think, Brian answered back with \\"Pet Sounds\\".  Both the Beatles and the Beach Boys had come a long way by 1966-67, And the Beach Boys had offered a album that challenged the fabs in 1966 in many ways, as Rubber Soul did to Brian, \\"Pet Sounds\\" made the Beatles really think. The Beatles(mainly Paul)saw what most Beach Boy fans would see a few years later in the amazing album Pet Sounds. As a result the Beatles answered with Sgt.Pepper.<br /><br />Pet Sounds was the Beach Boys zenith (they found themselves), yet here was Brian Wilson going to the next step with \\"Smile\\", this was a big task to say the least, and he came very close to doing it. But in all fairness, \\"Pet Sounds\\" didn't go over to well in 1966 with the fans, in fact it wouldn't until a few years later, so its possible Brian was probably still thinking he didn't reach the ultimate album yet, with the fans that is. So back to the drawing board he went. Who knows, if \\"Pet Sounds' would have been considered great as it is today, the Beach Boys next album may have been totally different.<br /><br />Now, I will say this, \\"Smile\\" would have been great if released, what I heard on bootlegs was beautiful and amazing, but that doesn't mean \\"Smiley Smile\\" is a bad album, because it really isnt, It's still a great sounding album.<br /><br />It starts out with a Wilson and VDParks masterpiece, \\"Heroes and Villains\\". All sorts of flavors on this song, Pop mixed with some barbershop quartet and a bit of jazz, with sound effects etc. Then a health song called \\"Vegetables\\" (McCartney is on this song somewhere), great harmony with a thumping bass guitar, more sound effects. Next is a song titled \\"Fall Breaks and Back To Winter\\" (Woody woodpecker symphony), Brian called it art music. If you listen in between the wood knock sounds, the deep echoed barks and bells etc. You can hear the Woody Woodpecker theme, an amazing song.<br /><br />\\"She's Goin Bald\\"(written by Wilson, Love, Parks), starts out like a lazy on the beach bongo song, then the tempo starts going up, in a animated sort of way, then it goes into a 50s piano boogie, about how this girl has no more hair, Good one! \\"Little Pad\\" is comic in its own way, in a Hawaiian song style.<br /><br />\\"Good Vibrations\\"..., its truly a beautiful and harmonic song. Its considered Their best, its one of the best songs from the 60s.<br /><br />\\"Wind Chimes\\" is beautiful and unique; it closes with \\"whispering winds\\".<br /><br />\\"Getting Hungry\\", a Wilson and Love rocker, also released as a single, the bass is played really nice on here.<br /><br />\\"Wonderful\\" is absolutely beautiful as Carl sings , almost whispering the song, yes the original was also great, but I love both. \\"Whistle in\\" is a one minute lyric repeated song with piano and bass guitar,truly a wonderful ditty. Most of this album, (but not the hits and most of Vegetables) was recorded in Brian's living room made into a makeshift studio, The Beach Boys couldnt convince him to go to the studio, so they brought the studio to him.<br /><br />Then there's the album \\"Wild Honey\\", the titled song is a R&B rocker. The whole album is pretty much R&B flavor.<br /><br />\\"A Thing Or Two\\" is a nice jazzy rocker written by Wilson and Love.<br /><br />The biggest hit on the Wild Honey album is \\"Darlin\\".<br /><br />\\"I'd Love Once To See You\\" is a \\"sitting on the ground playing the acoustic for everyone\\" style song by Brian, it has that 1967 feel to it, great song with Brian humor \\"I'd love once to see you...In the nude\\". \\"Here Comes The Night\\" is more R&B by Brian and Mike. \\"Let The Wind Blow\\" is a favorite for this fan here, its songs like this that put thisgroup in the great category.<br /><br />\\"How She Boogalooed it\\" is a rocker, and has that 1965 \\"Party Album\\" BB's sound to it, sung by Carl. I really like this one.<br /><br />\\"Mama Says\\" is another health song, as was \\"Vegetables\\", it was in fact part of that song originally.<br /><br />The bonus songs are fantastic; it shows the exhausting perfection Brian went through on \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Smile\\".<br /><br />\\"Can't Wait too Long\\" is a unbelievable unreleased gem.<br /><br />There you have it, \\"Smiley Smile/Wild Honey\\", two fantastic albums on one CD, its what they became in 1966-67, and they're great albums.<br /><br />Also check out the other great 2-fers, \\"Friends/20-20\\", \\"Sunflowers/Surfs Up\\", all the way to \\"15 Big ones/Love You\\", get them, you'll want them.group in the great category.<br /><br />\\"How She Boogalooed it\\" is a rocker, and has that 1965 \\"Party Album\\" BB's sound to it, sung by Carl.

0553106635|5.0|First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time                 (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic                 and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves                 the world against the Dark Lord.<br />                So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then                 someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!<br />                Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I                 know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:<br />                WHY TO READ GRRM<br />                (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds;                 boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . .                 . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though                 their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you                 get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.<br />                (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER                 CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes                 back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.<br />                This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like                 to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.<br />                (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES                 and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.<br />                (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue;                 lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is                 stupid or not too bright.<br />                (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up                 where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.                 Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone                 else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most                 importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it                 vague so that we are kept guessing.<br />                (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never                 get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to                 heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different                 opinions.<br />                (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />                (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and                 intrigue.<br />                (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate                 storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why                 each novel is between 700-900 pages.<br />                (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypesthat we are used to in most                 fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of                 characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.<br />                (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.<br />                (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.<br />                (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of                 mystery novels.<br />                (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read;                 realistic on how women think, too.<br />                (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.<br />                REASON TO NOT READ GRRM<br />                (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters                 after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so                 be warned.<br />                (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this                 may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story                 with strong archetypes.<br />                (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few                 characters, this might be confusing for you.<br />                (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears,                 this book may upset you.<br />                (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the                 series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.<br />                (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as                 much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.<br />                (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good                 young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to                 pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one                 or two characters. There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more                 grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every milisecond or carrying around some super powerful sword.<br />                (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works                 as this is biiig.<br />                (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). While                 this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to                 speak.<br />                By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his                 short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS.

B000002H2H|5.0|I got this tape about 10 years ago in 4th/5th grade and it is so good that I'm going to have to get the CD because tape players are out dated.  I am more of an old school Metallica fan, but this is my favorite Metallica album, and the songs are so good they'll put chills up your spine just listening to them.  Ever song is classic Metallica, and worth every penny it costs to buy this.  If you never got this album, believe me you've got to get it!
0380804557|4.0|This book is a fantastic journey through a land called Faerie... with several characters all in search of different matters of the heart.  Neil Gaiman has a wonderful way of creating fairy tales for adults with the same naivete as children's tales, but with an incredible maturity.  I enjoyed Gaiman's &quot;Neverwhere&quot; a bit more, but this book was wonderful as well.  It really allows for the mind to create the most beautiful images.  I recommend highly!
0385491026|4.0|When push came to shove,  Elaine shoved back at Cordelia the destructive projections that nearly klled her, and became the survivor of the headgame.  Though they continually tussled over the next thirty-something years, out of each others' sight but earily never out of mind,  Elaine again emerged the winner. I cheered for her each time she drew ahead,  and glowed with approval as she leveled the playing field with her caution, compassion and forgiveness for Cordelia.  What a friend she would have been to her tragically named counterpart, had Cordelia survived,  and what grief Elaine bore at the realization that in some life battles there can be only one survivor. I myself am involved in religious education, and stumbled onto Atwood's book because of its frequent and affectionate mention in Sally Cunneen's book, In Search of Mary--the Woman and the Symbol (1996). Atwood shows that the idea of Mary as a saving mother figure is universally understood and embraced, especially so in the artistic world in which there are no limits to presentations or appellations of her. In Elaine's world, at the juncture when she rejects and is rejected by Grace's (another ironic name chice)family's reactionary style of Anglicanism, her enemy's enemy truly becomes her best friend, and so evolves her receptivity to Cathoic myth and symbol, Mary.  Naturally Mary's antithesis is Mrs. Smeath;  and I cheered for Elaine as she had her say through her art. I loved Elaine's wonderfully sensitive mother, and her quirky intellectual family, who without religion had acheived an inborn faith. I must confess I know nothing of marbles; so the title Cat's Eye spoke to me instead of an instictive, survivor's gift of night-sight, maybe even ancient Egptian astrologer's wisdom. In the cover picture, the robed figure is not simply holding the eye (truth), but seems in the act of placing it into our hands, our possession. Yes, Elaine had to realize the truth that she was not dysfunctional, only weak and naive, and like the elevated eye, needed to see the whole landscape of her life. What an excelent job Atwood did of illustrating a confused, criticized girl's capability for self-mutilation, a survivor's guilt becoming self-destructve.  I would like Elaine to have shared more of her puberty experience and how it was handled in her family, and more about her first feelings of desire, as these were not mentioned. I agree, Amykrug, that ths is an anti-Yaya book, and was thinking that same thought as I read.  Let every parent who reads  this keep a cat's eye on their daughter and her friends! Lastly, I am impressed by the large number of reviews from far-off places like Malaysia, Argentina, I would like to have read more from the reader from Pakistan. (Please someone tell me what level A exams are).
0060278234|4.0|In the Old Kingdom, Lirael feels like a freak as the only person among the Clayr sisterhood who cannot see into the future.  Being \\"blind\\" shames the teenager making her wonder just who she.  By her nineteenth birthday, Lirael knows she has no one to help her except her Disreputable Dog.  However, her time of hiding in the library ends, when the Clayr foresees her involvement in a war against evil with a world at stake.  She is sent forth to do great things despite her own fear of shortcomings.<br /><br /> Feeling incompetent, Prince Sameth can no longer handle his role as the heir apparent to his mother Queen Sabriel.  Rather then continue his education and preparation, Sameth decides he is no hero and will not be the key focus of the fight against the Dead.  Sameth meets Lirael and her canine meets his acerbic cat Mogget as they journey together to save the world.<br /> LIRAEL, the sequel to the fabulous SABRIEL is as good as the first novel.  The prime theme centers on the Good vs. Evil epic fantasy.  However, the deep lead couple with their flaws, fears, and lack of confidence turns the story line into an exciting adventure where the malevolent forces seem ready to win.  Though many threads remain loose for hopefully the next novel to tie up, fans of epic fantasy, especially the Potter crowd, will fully enjoy Garth Nix's fantastic spin.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00004Z459|5.0|I think, I dont promise too much, if I say that LINKIN PARK is the best NU METAL, RAP METAL etc.- BAND this time, forget LIMP BIZKIT, forget FREDDY DURST. Its time for the new and fresh princes of this genre. I dont hate LIMP BIZKIT, but since ROLLIN, I feel sick when I see FREDDY somewhere on MTV, they became a very childish band after a time. LP are much more mature, their lyrics are very good and they dont sing about cars, money and t(...)ts. Their (in my opinion) best song IN THE END, proves their real quality. Their sound reminds me of a mix of LIMP BIZKIT (sorry...), STABBING WESTWARD and MICHAEL JACKSON(!) what shows the very large musical background they were influenced from. They combine aggressive shouts (ONE STEP CLOSER, FORGOTTEN) with melodic passages (CRAWLING, IN THE END, PUSHING ME AWAY) in their innovative mix of (Nu)-Metal, HipHop, Grunge and 80s Pop. BUY THIS CD, IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY BOUGHT IT!!!
0440224764|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and held it to the bitter end.  Full of twists...I would have never predicted how this one ended!  Great book, I highly recommend it!
B00000163G|5.0|This was the first Tupac album I ever bought, and it was so good, I had to go back and buy his older ones because I couldn't believe what I was missing.  I can listen to every single song on here, with the exception of 1 or 2 songs, and they still haven't gotten old after 5 years, since I first got the CD.  There is no better rapper than Tupac and if you don't have this CD, you are cheating yourself.
B000059XUP|1.0|The first Crow was an excellent film....and it's so tragic how the entire plot of the movie circles around death and in the process of making it Brandon Lee's life came to an end....he in the process though made one of the best movies i've ever seen. The best action movie ever, unquestionably......the plot was great, the acting was brilliant, the script had meaning, heart, soul........there is not one bad word you can say about the first Crow. Rest In Peace Brandon.<br />As far as Crow 2: City Of Angels<br />GRRRRR!!!!!! BAD BAD BAD BAD SHAMEFUL BAD<br />This movie is terrible. Brandon has been replaced with a fat balding english man hopping around yelling stupid stuff to the extent of &quot;I'm going to get you&quot;...the witty repartee has been replaced with terrible drivel. Iggy Pop isn't even a threatening villain...but maybe it's because Iggy Pop is so cool.<br />Even Iggy Pop and The Deftones couldn't save this one. Dont waste your money.....go buy The Crow and marvel at it's greatness.
B000059T5O|5.0|The vault of Tom Waits' back-catalogue has been smashed open, 13 songs wrenched from it, beaten within an inch of their lives and brought, screaming, into the light.  <br />With the help of a gloriously raw production by Waits himself, John Hammond has spawned the blues album of this, or any other year.<br />13 tracks of gravel, needles, broken glass, smoke and sweat distilled by the deep velvet growl of Hammond, who has never sounded better, he was born for this.<br />Can't get the CD off the player. One of those albums that makes you close your eyes, grit your teeth, grimace and crank the amp up one notch louder. Tough to pick out a favourite.....maybe Heartattack &amp; Vine or Clap Hands.   Only shame is that it will be filed under 'John Hammond/Blues' which may deprive a larger audience of a true gem. <br />BUY IT, BEG IT, BORROW IT, STEAL IT....BEFORE IT LEAVES TOWN ON THE 2.19
6305232660|4.0|Deep Impact and Armageddon are so similar, but I feel that Deep Impact hit me harder with much more feeling.<br />A huge comet is headed towards earth.  It is pretty much the end of the world for most everybody.  Only about a million or so people can stay in a huge mountain until the dust clears and they will have to start life in the U.S. over again.  Well, this one boy, who had studied the comet has to make a choice within the movie, go with his parents to live in the mountain or stay back and try to find and save his newly wed wife.  I must admit, I cried in this movie, and I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you who haven't seen it.<br />Deep Impact for me was a door opening and got me to think, what if this really happened.  It's a definite rent, and if this movie has the same effect on you as it did for me, you won't be disappointed.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick's last film is an existential tour de force.  It is a fascinating exploration into the sexual mores of modern man, handled with a masterful melding of subject matter and style that is typical of Kubrick.  Nudity is plentiful, but there is hardly any overt sex, for one of the movie's themes is REPRESSION.  The duality of human nature (recalling the line in FULL METAL JACKET) is once again the driving force of the plot: love/hate, honesty/deceit, reality/fantasy, freedom/repression, etc.  Kitman's performance is great.  Cruise's is alright.  Kubrick, well, is Kubrick.<br />This DVD is the R-rated version, and so is the remastered DVD edition to be released this June.  The unrated version without the censored scenes that Kubrick had objected to is not yet available as a Region 1 DVD.  In fact, no one in North America has seen the uncensored version.
B000002WU9|5.0|Biggie's &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, Nas's &quot;Illmatic&quot;, GZA's &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; and this album are just a few of the bona fide classics that dropped in the mid '90s.  I didn't comprehend the greatness of those albums then because there was so much quality being released at once.  But the brilliance of these effort becomes more evident each time I turn on the radio today.  I'm no Wu-cheerleader.  But it's hard not to appreciate &quot;Cuban Linx.&quot;  The hard snare of of &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot;, the calm, apocalyptic Nas verse on &quot;Verbal Intercourse&quot;, the sparse production and lyrical punch of &quot;Spot Rusherz&quot; and the classic Wu-sound of &quot;Ice Cream&quot; will definitely earn this album in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame.

Reciever of Memories is, recieving memories from the past, when the world was not perfect. Memories of war and lonelyness. Pain and sadness. This book interprets the fact that there is no perfect world. Jonas is not alloud to share the memories or his feelings with his friends or family.  This book was the best book I have read in a long time!
0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is my favourite book of His Dark Materials trilogy,I think its one of those once-in-a-lifetime fantasy books,those that after reading them make you feel youve learnt something. And behind all the story lays a sort of &quot;mith&quot;:Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Meanwhile Lyras and Wills adventures take place, trying to explain us what the whole story is all about:growing up.That time when youre not a child but youre not an adult either. And youve got to trust yourself and choose the right path to go through ,from being young and inocent to be someone with experience. I think Pullman suggests that when Eve made the original sin, that action is what makes us be humans. Cause thats our nature and nobody can change us.We guide ourselves by our feelings and emotions not by the fact of right or wrong and that way were happy , were doing what we ourselves like to do not what somebody else wants us to do.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This movie came as a shockingly well-orchestrated film! I wasn't going watch this, thinking it's boring old drama (I usually go for sci-fi, action, special effects) and went into the movie by way of entertaining my cousin, who wanted to watch it. But surprise surprise!!! The dance sequences ARE the special effects! They weren't ballet as such, more of a combination of Michael Flatley's Riverdance moves, with quite a lot of Stomp, modern dance and only a pinch of ballet. The choreography convinced me that it was all the action I need in a movie.<br />True to British movies, Billy Elliot is chocka-block full of subtle messages (e.g. true friendship, the human spirit, following one's own passion, history, brushing off stereotypes, family values, etc.). A major message of the movie is &quot;have guts to follow your passion&quot;. In fact, we could almost use Gattaca's line for this movie : &quot;There is no gene for the human spirit&quot;. Very positive messages emanate throughout the film. The fact that Stephen Daldry sidestepped political issues was a blessing in order to give the movie the crispy richness of its content.<br />Jamie Bell (who TOTALLY deserves his BAFTA - hey where's his Academy Award?) and Julie Walters (feisty and funny at the same time!) truly shine in this film. Stephen Daldry, keep up the great work you're producing! What's next?
0517122707|5.0|This is a true laugh-out-loud book.  One of the funniest and cleverest books I've ever read, and in my top five all-time favorites in general. Ignatius taught me how to become an anarchist at my job, too.  I was a secretary when I read this book.  For several months after I finished it, I would just throw in the garbage various pieces of mail for my coworkers that I deemed to be worthless.  A promotion for tickets to the football game?  Organized sports is a racket and bad for society.  In the trash it went.  I loved living vicariously through Ignatius J. Reilly.  He is an inspiration is a really twisted way.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminems sophomore effort is full of hate, mysoginism, paranoia, and fear, and thats also what our society is full of lately, too. First off, as offensive and shocking as Eminem may be, he is an excellent songwriter, and at least deserves credit for that. Marshall Mathers LP is an excellent album in every aspect, one of the best rap albums of all time. From the incredibly catchy &quot;Real Slim Shady,&quot; the controversial &quot;Kill You,&quot; to &quot;Stan,&quot; the deepest song on the album that takes a serious look at how music affects some people, this album takes a deep look into the negative side of our society. Eminem takes on many personalities on this album, from the psycho who wants to kill his girlfriend and rape his mother, to the depressed rapper who hates boy bands amd just wants to be left alone. Anyone who is easily offended, I strongly advise you against buying this album. The lyrics on this album are very explicit, violent, and shocking. Like I said before, despite being controversial and sometimes offensive, this album is definitely essential listening, if not a must own. As a rap album it is one of the best, as an album it is a work of art. I repect Eminem for taking on important issues to the fullest extent, we need someone who speaks the truth about todays society.
158234082X|5.0|You can take the boy out of college but you can't take the college out of the boy.  Bourdain pretends to be a &quot;bad street boy&quot;  but his passionate, witty and highly sophisticated account is so accurate, it has made most of my chef friends wince and laugh with recognition at the same time.  &quot;Bravo&quot; and a drink for the chef, if not an honorary college degree. And, yes, make me a reservation at Les Halles.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was the BEST movie I've seen- EVER! And the Soundtrack , is just as GREAT! I play it all the time and remember those funny scenes from the movie! I can't wait ... [to]  own a copy! I've never been this excited over a movie, ever!
B00004WKII|5.0|This four cd collection spans the course of Jimi Hendrix's short but very sweet musical career. It has alot of rare and previously unreleased material, including covers of Dylan's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, Chuck Berry's &quot;Johnny B Good&quot;, the Beatles &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, and much much more. This collection has so many awesome tracks and live performances i can't even begin to talk about them all. But in short this set offers tons of stuff that hasn't been heard before on any other Hendrix album or compilation. It's simply incredible how much music the man made in the few short years he was recording.<br /> And to top things off the presentation of the Experience box set is magnificent. The box itself is purple velvet, and includes an incredible 80-page color booklet full of pictures and information on Hendrix's life and career! I would strongly recommend this to any music lover or fan of Hendrix. This is certainly one of the nicest box sets i have ever seen or heard. A Must-Have!!
0525945636|1.0|Code to Zero would have been a great science fiction novel -- in 1958, the year this story is alleged to occur. <br />Claude Lucas, a rocket engineer suffering global amnesia, struggles to determine who he is, why people are trying to kill him, and what secret threatens the success of America's first artificial satellite which is to be launched within two days.<br />Dr. Lucas' confusion may be compounded because he also finds himself in a world that did not exist in 1958.  His mystery focusses on the location and meaning of &quot;xeroxed&quot; rocket blueprints which are missing along with his memory.  But blueprints were still &quot;blue&quot; in 1958 because photocopying was still rare and expensive.  And the first &quot;xerox&quot; machines would not be marketed for another year, nor would &quot;xeroxing&quot; become a verb for another decade.  Other anomalies (the FBI building is built 15 years early, and passenger trains are again running on time despite being well into their final decline)abound, adding to the surrealism.  <br />Lucas also fails to recognize that virtually every scene in his life replays one redrafted Hitchcock movie after another.  Although two Union Station scenes, one Pullman car scene, and a kidnapping by a national monument would not be filmed until 1959  (North by Northwest), the entire plot is a watered down version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, 39 Steps and other films with which Lucas would have been familiar.<br />This derivative plot unfortunately flouts the rules which enabled successful Hitchcock thrillers.  The content of the &quot;McGuffin&quot; (the missing blueprints) is important, and the chases and unsuccessful efforts to kill the hero are pedantically described and ultimately silly.<br />The author compensates for bad Hitchcok by adding bad LeCarre. Read LeCarre, substitute &quot;Harvard&quot; for &quot;Cambridge&quot;, and you know the reasons for every bad political decision by characters in this book.  And the book willgive you a shorter explanation than does this paragraph. <br />The writer treats the readers as suffering short term memory loss and needlessly repeats details.  For instance, Dr. Lucas' wife is described as a woman who likes &quot;modern&quot; furniture -- even after we have &quot;seen&quot; her furniture twice over two decades in the story.<br />The book has a great description of the Jupiter C rocket system, and this description is broken into compelling prologues to each chapter. Unfortunately, these technical descriptions of an engineering triumph underscore the uninspired prose of this artistic failure.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Everyone who has ever felt like the underdog should see this movie.  This movie was one of the best movies of 2000.  I had to convince my husband to see it (not a BALLET movie...), but after the lights came back up in the theatre, I noticed something that I hadn't expected--a big grin on his face.  Billy Elliot inspires!  It tugs at your emotions and really makes you evalute your own dreams.  See this movie--it doesn't ever disappoint!
B000056K04|3.0|First things first, this cd isn't as bad as everyone thinks!! DMB decided to go in a new direction and that is fine. There are some great songs on this cd(The Space Between among others) and when Glenn Ballard took over, everyone should have realized that there was a new sound coming!! All bands must evolve and change their sound over time, its called growing. Needless to say, I miss the old DMB just like a lot of people do, and yes I do own a copy of the Lillywhite Sessions which are far superior. You get to hear other instruments besides guitar! Anyways, I'm gonna catch the boys from Virginia on the road this summer so maybe that will renew my faith in the band. I would suggest buying this cd, its good, but just be ready for a change.
B000005PRX|3.0|Batman takes a back seat to Burton's deranged ideas- killer clowns, seductive cat women, mutants, an army of penguins, and other nonsense.  It's simply too much.  The plot is confusing and extremely convoluted, and by the time it's half way through, you just don't care.  Wheras the excellent first film had Batman fighting an actual human (though terribly scared), this time Batman spends most of his time killing rampaging circus freaks.  The dark, serious, surrealistic, apocalyptic feel of the first film is totally lost here.  It's been thrown out the window in favor of pure craziness, Burton-style.  Plus, Elfman's score is too light and very dissapointing.  But, the few action scenes it has are great, and it does have some standout performances.  And it's certainly better than the Kilmer/Clooney crap movies.
B0000065O1|5.0|I taped over the first one accidentally, lost the second, and had to buy this one a third time.  It is worth that!  It is so tough.  It will give you a satisfying full body workout that will leave you feeling like you have accomplished something.  This is the best total body workout video I have found.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Hi, everyone!! The movie, Billy Elliot is absoultely great!!!  i watched it three times in theatre..actually, i wanted to watch it more before being released, because the movie was really amazing..:) definitely, this film is my favourite..<br />Billy can dream..he can dance..he can smile.. he loves to dance.. unfortunately, his mother died when he was young and his family is poor.. but billy is never frustrated.. he just try to do what he wants most..<br />the movie is really touching! <br />actors are really great, especially, Jamie Bell(Billy Elliot).. his acting is unbelievable!! can't believe he was only 14 last year.. i also like the actor, Stuart Wells who acted Billy's friend, Michael..<br />i wanna say only this: just watch the movie!!
B00000IL1K|3.0|If you like the sound of Olivia Newton-John, you'll love most of this album.  Brightman's voice sounds like Newton-John's on most of the tracks, but with a sparkle that Newton-John only wishes she had.  If you want an album that shows off the power and dynamic range that Brightman's wonderful soprano voice can deliver, this is probably not the CD for you.  A couple of times, she lets loose with a few measures of voice that would remind you of Frederica Von Stada or Kiri Te Kanawa and those few times it is enough to cause chills to run down your spine in its splendor.  I just wish Brightman would put out a full CD of the work that she is capable of, using her voice to its fullest capacity.
0452282152|1.0|Never have I been so bored by the style of writing, nor so angry at the flimsy content of a book capitalizing on my favorite artist's life.  As stated elsewhere, the cover art was the lure here, and I also had to force myself to finish it, waiting for a momentum which never materialized.  This book left me feeling ripped off, since $12+ for a paperback is not peanuts.  The book's cover hyperbole bears no relation to the book that I plodded through.  These accolades, and others read elsewhere, were too freely bestowed on a very minor talent.  Who are these book reviewers setting standards for the rest of us?   Tracy Chevalier should give up writing -- no-one else can drag out nothingness for page after page as she can.  I would not even pass this book along to friends.
B000001FK3|5.0|If there was a God JJ Cale would be a superstar bigger than Michael Jackson. Instead he is a relatively well kept secret. He sings in a way that makes each song seem as if he is singing it personally, to you, on his front porch, as the sun goes down. He is soulful, his songs moody, meaningful, and full of emotion. If you prefer the sentiment in your blues slapped on with a trowel try the overrated 'slow hands' Eric Clapton. If you like blues that'll make the hairs on your neck stand up as well as touch your heart try Naturally. JJ Cale is a genius. There is nothing more to add.
B000002UUX|5.0|Everthing about this album screams mind boggling brilliance &amp; perfection: - the cover art; compositions of incredible technicality, complexity, intelligence &amp; 'rightness'; the sheer flair and undeniable mastery of drummer Nick Menza; the superhuman guitar playing and tone of both Mustaine &amp; Freidman; the crystalline production; and finally the awesome precision and telepathic cohesiveness of this insanely hot band.         In addition to the obligitory and deserved adulation, Megadeth are to be congratulated for this absolute high water mark of both speed metal and music in general.                         An absolute must-have for any self respecting fan of metal, guitars or inspirational music.
1563890119|5.0|The sandman is unlike anything I have ever read before, is it good or bad you ask?It is good,no,VERY good.The sandman isn't  about another kind hearted super hero out to save the world from some villian who has a master plan to rule the universe,infact,the sandman isn't even kindhearted,he isn't evil either although he is very dark.The sandman is more like a catalyst, a watcher and player sometimes in the game of life and death,he doesn't look for trouble,it comes to him.Neil Gaiman (my favourite author after reading the sandman series) truly outdid himself here, he is outstanding,very unpredictable and easy to read,Mike mckean did an amazing job with the illustrations as well.The sandman is a series that will amaze anyone who reads it old and young,why? because a good book is a good book no matter what,and this qualifies as a VERY good book.
B000002UC5|5.0|...this is a moody album.. its light,poppy,hard,raw, rugged, &amp; most of all melodic....its a happy,but expressive album...its great probably my favorite of pauls' solo albums... he plays all the instruments (its homemade).. if you like Paul McCartney = you will love &quot;McCartney&quot;......its not &quot;great lyrics&quot;, but its the melody of the &quot;MUSIC&quot;...&amp; he makes it as usual with the same melodic genius as usual....very great moody happy yet expressive album..a must have for any Beatle fan...
B00003CXDD|5.0|An abandoned baby in danger find the &quot;want to be&quot; wizard Willow and the adventure begins. I have all the Tolkiens books and i never thinked in the relations: but Willow is near in &quot;spirit&quot; to Bilbo in &quot;the hobbit&quot;, both left the confort and went to a travel beyond their imaginations. A friend rent this movie years ago because she supposed that: &quot;i will like it&quot;...and she was right! Warwick is corageous, sincere and determinated, im not a fan of Val Kilmer but in this picture he did it well, is good to know that he married Sorsha, excuse me, Joanne Whalley after completing this movie... IM REALLY WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you don't like this film, you either have no taste or you don't understand the concept.  This is as good as gets in cinematography, direction, story and anything else you can think of.  The Coen Brothers are in my opinion the greatest film makers in &quot;hollywood&quot;.  Get this as soon as possible, you will not regret it.  If you don't believe me, just wait until the academy awards roll around.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I used to like Limp Bizkit...before they totally sold out. Their first cd was awesome and their second was OK...but chocolate starfish is just BAD. DONT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!! Limp Bizkit was a good band but now they are just crap. If u MUST buy a Limp Bizkit cd, buy the first one...the others suck.
0385484518|4.0|Dying is one of lifes greatest lessons and it is something that we all have to deal with.  I feel that this book explisitly explains the real effects of dying and the reall joy in living. While reading this book the reader gets the sence that he or she know s Morrie personally.  You go through reading the book and think ing about all of the issues that are brought to Morries attentioin by Mitch.  Weather it is about relationships, money, spending time with family and friends, or even dying.  Morrie seems to see the good in all of it.      You find yourself wondering how could a man so old in age and so much on his death bed be so positive about everything.  From his living funeral to his life long lessons you will learn that this is a man of character.      At the end of Morries life I feel that he really did do all of the things that he wanted to fulfill. And at the end of the adventure with Morrie, Mitch knows of all the stories and lessons and i htink that he will carry them with him forever.
0064407667|5.0|I have read the entire series (and will go on doing so until Snickett puts the Baudelaires out of their misery), and can only be surprised at the people who seem incapable of seeing these hilarious and blatant parodies for what they are.   These books read in a doleful, deadpan, Poe-like tone, while discussing terrible events...events that become so terrible that they cross the line to silliness. You have an old-style melodrama villian in Count Olaf. In the three heroes, you have the distilled goodness, courage, resource and sweetness of every hero of every melodramatic childrens book ever written. In Mr. Poe you have the quintessential essence of those eternal, frustrating characters who always refuse to believe children because they ARE children. Every character and situation in the book is a stereotype, overblown and caricatured to the point where you are forced to giggle at it.  Sunny's 'conversation', the author's autobiographical notes, and the sometimes hilarious definitions of words add to the spice. For good measure, the three children are honestly likeable!  Very well written, both stylistically, and for 'grab' value. A series to be read and reread and snickered over many times!  But NOT, for heaven's sake, to be taken seriously.<br /> Puttanesca sauce, anyone?
B00003CWOL|5.0|This being the forth Kevin Smith movie, I was highly entertained.  Kevin Smith's clever and witty writting mixxed with talented actors such as Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Chris Rock make for many laughs.  If you have a problem with jokes that deal with religion then you may want stay clear of this one.  If you are a Kevin Smith fan then most likely you have seen this one, if not I recommend it all the way!
1881273156|5.0|Dr. Chapman has cristalised his theory of the 5 love languages in a simple and easy-to-understand way. I started wondering why my husband didn't seem impressed with the fact that I am buying him ties and shirts. He wondered why I always wanted him to take the rubbish out. We read the book together and it solved our mysteries. My love language are words of affirmation, acts of service and receiving gifts and his are acts of service and physical touch. I had realised that he would be very upset if I didn't iron his shirts anymore or prepare him his breakfast bag to the office so he would get his bite in the morning. These meant more to him as acts of love than buying him things. And since then, we have always spoken in our 'love-tank' language: We ask each other 'How does your love tank look like today?' He surprised me with flowers when I got my job interview now that I am looking for employment. He would tell me more often now how much he appreciates a good meal cooked by me or the fact that I dress well for him. Sometimes it takes a big effort to do things you don't like to do but if it is the love language of your mate, you would love him or her enough to want to fill up that love tank. At times even if I don't feel like being intimate with my husband, I take the time to prepare myself and pamper him because I know this is his love language. .... I recommend this book to all couples, even if your relationship is doing very well, because it helps you to understand why your relationsip is doing so well!
B000050XEI|5.0|Ever since I discovered Irish music, I've been hooked but Enya's music blew me away. The melodies in &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; are so relaxing you'll feel like all your problems just flow away. This album makes you feel (at least for me)like you are out in the green fields of Ireland free of your worries. It makes you feel like you are in a magical and totally relaxing place. I say this because as you hear each track you will start to visualize wonderful thoughts.This is how powerful Enya's music is. It's incredible!!! This is just the kind of music everyone should hear from time to time because it frees you from the stress of everyday life and helps you connect with yourself even my 11 year old loves her music. I don't know how Enya does it. The downside of this CD is that there are only 11 tracks and I was hungry for more that's why I recommend you buy her previous album &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; so &quot;a day without Enya&quot; will be a day of stress.  Buy this CD NOW!
B00003CX8J|3.0|The special effects almost make this movie a keeper--however the lack of attention to the actual comic series leaves true fans with a lot to be desired.
B0000524E5|1.0|Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible.  My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the  same time.  It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format.
6301174240|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of MJ, the dances in the vidio are great.  The Movie is a bit long and drawn out.  Overall a great vidio for MJ fans everywhere!!  Loved &quot;Baby Bad&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot;!

B000002J6H|5.0|What could the reviewer possibly mean that Stills was not the most accomplished of the artist in CSN or CSNY.  Yes we all love the gritty Young, but the truth is he barely showed up for the recording sessions traveled separately from the group and has given half hearted efforts into several projects tHey are a better group without the sulking Mr. Young.  As CSN goes, Stills is the glue that held the group togther musically.  He wrote most of the better songs and arranged them all Crosby and Nash would have been spares without Stills' glaring talent to lead the way.  I' ve own this album, tape, CD in some form since 1970.  It show cases the individual talents of someone who just wanted to make music not headlines.
B0000024YL|5.0|This is a really great CD! I've always been a big fan of Simon and Garfunkel, so I decided to buy this one to start out with. It was an excellent choice. It includes most of their best songs, including Bridge Over Troubled Water, The Sound of Silence, and Cecilia. The only problem I noticed with the CD is the applause kind of interrupting the beginning of a few songs. Otherwise, one of the best CD's I own. It's one of the few CD's where you will enjoy every song on it.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I've got a few Clapton CD's, but this is by far one of the best. &quot;Travelin' Light&quot; and &quot;Son &amp; Sylvia&quot; great songs.

6300182193|5.0|From 1979, this is the sensual Dracula...Frank Langella, repeating his hit stage performance in this John Badham directed version, plays the Count as seductive and irresistible...with his smooth as honey voice and flowing costumes. The first thing you see of him is his hand, slowly emerging from a fur cloak...it's one of my very favorite moments on film.<br />Kate Nelligan is stunningly beautiful as Lucy. She plays her as strong and liberated and a willing participant in the Count's plans. Laurence Olivier is wonderful as always, in a performance that's about as &quot;over the top&quot; as he'd ever done. Also good are Donald Pleasence, marvelously insubtle as Dr. Seward, and Trevor Eve, as a more &quot;macho&quot; than usual Jonathan Harker.<br />John Williams' lush score adds a lot to this film, which though it departs radically from the original book, has a lot of atmosphere, exotic sets, and sumptuous (though darkly hued) cinematography.<br />I find the Dracula legend fascinating, and don't think I've missed a single filmed version...this is one of the two I have watched the most, the other being the Coppola one, and both films get better with repeated viewings...so if you're a Drac fan, don't miss this voluptuous twist on the old tale.
B000059QYB|5.0|After watching the 'Behind the Music' on Idol last weekend, I knew I had to pick up this cd.  It brings back all the old favorites, and he sounds just as good now as he did then.  With the passing of Joey Ramone, it's good to have reminders of just how influential the punk scene of the early 80's continues to be.I'm looking forward to the new album, too.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is one of the most complex and outstanding albums of all time.  The Beatles were beginning to break up, but their music was just as good.  Sure it may be not as &quot;organized&quot; as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, but it is just as great.  This is an album to listen to repeatedly.  But one of the greatest albums by the GREATEST band of all time.  The WORST song on this album is better than most bands BEST.  And that's the truth, Ruth.
0451160916|4.0|Having first seen only the 1980 Stanley Kubrick version of The Shining and the Simpsons satire, I was uncertain what to expect of the original novel. Upon beginning my reading, I now understand why Stephen King was so disappointed with the movie. The pages of this bestseller are laced with more depth and strong characterization than found on the movie screen. The Shining is worthy of much critical praise as well as from lovers of the genre.   The plot of this novel is familiar to many. The Torrance family begins the novel about to spend the winter at the Overlook Hotel. Jack Torrance, an educated, published professional, has lost his job at a prestigious private school when in a fit of violent anger he blacks out and beats a student. The Torrances have had a colorful history, with Jack as a violent, recovering alcoholic who once broke his son's arm in a fit of rage, Wendy as the product of a broken home and a vicious, controlling mother, and Danny as a young child who has the shining, which is akin to ESP or other psychic ability. This family, with their history and expansive characterizations, interested in staying together and persevering, is the driving opposition to the Overlook Hotel, with its equally weighty history and rooms full of \\"people\\" interested in consuming this family. In the first part, King frames a perfect picture of this conflict with the Torrances on the porch in almost a family picture, set against the Overlook Hotel.<br /> Stephen King selected a genre that suggested his thematic pursuits. By selecting a ghost story, King could deal with absolving missteps in history, the weight of historical events today, the cyclical patterns of history, and inter-personal dynamics among those being haunted. Though King has suffered critical disdain as a \\"genre writer,\\" until the appearance of The Green Mile, this was perhaps the only reasonable dramatic choice he could have made in pursuit of his themes. Selecting romance or science fiction or western, or even a regular adult fiction would not have accomplished the same ends.<br /> The dramatic choices are not only interesting; they are useful to the novel. Rather than his original idea to set this book in an amusement park, King selects an old hotel, ripe with many individual histories in each room. The cycles of the Overlook have repeated themselves, the murder rampages, suicides, and attacks, every year. In fact, another caretaker's family suffered the same potential fate of the Torrances the last winter. Likewise, the Torrance family has its own cycles, which they have thus far continued, to break (Jack's father's violence and alcoholism, Wendy's mother's tendency to criticize her husband and controlling habits). The characterizations are interesting, give the story depth, and also reflect the ideas of the cyclical nature of history.<br /> Stephen King has not always produced stellar literary works, but The Shining deserves an honored place in the modern literary canon. The Torrances are written to keep the reader turning the pages as they battle the forces of the Overlook, including cycles of American history, hotel history and their own cycle of family history, yet the dramatic choices are thoughtful enough to evoke thematic concerns that reverberate within the reader. The Shining is not just a thriller or a genre book. It utilizes this resource and then transcends the boundaries. To literary fans, to fans of the movie, to all readers who appreciate both dramatic and thematic dexterity I recommend The Shining.
B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie is simply outstanding.  It is certainly one of Billy Wilder's best(he has so many BESTS).  Jack Lemmon has never been better and I cannot wait for the DVD, which will allow it to be seen widescreen (which most movies DESERVE to be seen).  Please watch this movie - it is very funny and touching at the same time.  Hot diggity dog this movie is good.

The book is about one of Mitch's old college professors who has suddenly came down with ALS... a terminal disease. Throughout the book you'll find yourself asking questions about life. Questions you'll strive to find answers to. Mitch's college professor, Morrie Schwartz is a favorite among many and is loved by everyone. Reading this book will give you a complete and totally different outlook on your life. You'll question wheather or not money is so important, or wheather or not popularity is important. Read this fun, interesting, loving book. You'll really enjoy it! I promise.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is another amazingly great Beatles album.  This is where they really started to break free and blow minds.  This is required listening.  Please buy.
B000059QYB|5.0|Good stuff from one of the few non-joke artists to emerge in the 80's. I am disappointed the album does not include &quot;Speed&quot; nor &quot;Blue Highway.&quot; But love it nonetheless, and like what Billy did with the new track &quot;Don't You Forget About Me.&quot; Billy Idol is probably the only non-hypocritical rock star to come along since Jim Morrison. That's why I love him so much.
B000002UB3|5.0|Just when you think the Beatles were through and that they couldn't top &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or the White album, along comes  &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  All of the songs are great.  The &quot;Sun King&quot; through &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot; montage is completely awesome.  As is the &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; through &quot;The End&quot;.  I thought it was brilliant to have &quot;Her Majesty&quot; after &quot;The End&quot; because it seems like it doesn't fit.  But in an odd way - it does.  Of course &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; are timeless classics that start off this amazing piece of musical history.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson's excellent,powerful performance;yet only a small ingredient of a richly detailed modern epic.Takes you in right from the start,the character of Wallace,so convincing,you'll feel every emotion,loss,anger,and sense of true freedom,few films could ever achieve with such awe.An excellent transfer for this dvd adds up to a film that must surely be part of any collection.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is arguably the Beatles best work.  It contains great songs and possibly their greatest &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot;  It starts off great and keeps on truckin' until the end.  This is a must own album that should be listened to repeatedly.
1559409010|5.0|So...is it Meaning of Life - OR - Life of Brian?  Just go ahead and try to choose.  Most people I ask say MEANING.  Ask why and they mention the &quot;Sperm Song&quot; (I think it was Terry Gilliam who once said that Meaning of Life will probably be the only movie in history to have a full production number about sperm).  It really is so hilarous that you have to pause the movie after to catch your breath.  Next they mention the scene with the grim reaper.  &quot;You didn't use CANNED sammon...did you?&quot;  And the topless roller derby girls chasing the man to his death.  And don't forget &quot;the machine that goes ping!&quot;<br />So...how can I argue the fact that I like Life of Brian so much its on my top 2 favorite comedy movie list.  It ain't easy.  I like BRIAN for the same reason I like the OTHER movie in my top 2 list.  That other movie is the Inspector General.  Graham Chapman's Brian character is much like Danny Kaye's Inspector character.  They are each simple men who are thrown into roles of great stature.  Danny Kaye always liked these kinds of roles and he did them well.  Chapman was the perfect Python to play Brian.  I'm exilarated each time I watch these.  With BRIAN on my shelf...I'll wait for Inspector General widescreen DVD next.<br />NOTE:  This Criterion edition is not lacking.  Read the listing and you'll see why the price is justified.  My favorite extras are the deleted scenes and the Python documentary &quot;The Pythons&quot;.  Now I can watch this movie as many times as I want and never have to worry about it wearing out!!
B000002UB6|5.0|This is a great album - however not as great as some of the other Beatles albums - it does feel a bit short, but its still a lot better than most.  Some brilliant, timeless songs are here to be cherished forever.  So just let it be.
B000001ESN|5.0|This album is one of their BEST, along side &quot;2112&quot;,&quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;, and &quot;Different Stages-Live&quot;. The Best Songs...I Think, are &quot;Spirit Of Radio&quot;,&quot;Freewill&quot;,&quot;Entre Nous&quot; and &quot;Natural Science&quot;. All cool songs. The Next Best Album After 'Permanent Waves' is 'Exit...Stage Left'. BUY IT TODAY!
B000002UDB|5.0|If you think this album is not any good - you must have something wrong with you.  This has two of John's greatest songs  - &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.  How can you past that up?
B00004YA66|5.0|I just saw Frequency and was quite impressed.<br />Parts of the film sent chills down my spine. Both the casting and the acting were extremely good in this movie. Jim Caveizel (who played the homeless addict in the less-than-stellar Pay It Forward) is perfect for the part here, as is Dennis Quaid for the role of his father. <br />The film is about a policeman in Queens, NY, whose firefighter dad died in the line of duty when he was six years old (in 1966). Thirty years later, on an October night in 1999, as he is fiddling with his ham radio, the now 36-year-old son hears a voice coming from the radio that is somehow familiar. Unbeknownst to both men at first, his father is on the other &quot;end,&quot; and is speaking to him from 1969, the day before he is to be killed in the fire. When the son (&quot;John Sullivan&quot;) figures out that he's speaking to his father, he quickly tells his father about the terrible fire that will occur the next day, and tells him about the fatal mistake his father made 30 years before, in an effort to prevent the tragedy and save his father's life. Luckily, the plan works, and the Senior Sullivan (&quot;Frank&quot;), changes his actions accordingly on the day of the blaze and survives the fire. Unfortunately, the fact of his survival changes things beyond either of their imaginations. Everything the father does now that he is alive will affect everything else, since he &quot;wasn't supposed to be there.&quot; This is an interesting part of the film, because I'm sure people often think, &quot;what if I/they had done that instead, where would I be now?...what impact would that have had on the world, or on other people's lives.... would I have met my spouse/been in an accident/avoided an accident?&quot; etc, etc...<br />A parallel storyline is that John (the son) is working on a case involving a serial killer who goes after nurses (the &quot;Nightingale Murders,&quot; they're called). But after he saves his father's life, his mother (a nurse) suddenly disappears from the family pictures... and he has to find a way to save both her (in the past, through communicating with his father) and any other of the serial killer's victims, (and also figure out the identity and whereabouts of the killer, in order to save them). The plot may sound a bit silly and outlandish in such a brief description, but the actors and the details play this out so well that it becomes a riveting, suspenseful film. The film makes up for any deficiencies in the realism (of radio time-travel) with an engaging story, lots of well-paced action, and characters who are played so well that you care what happens to them, and want it to be good. It is an interesting journey into &quot;what-if's,&quot; and even though those of us who have lost a parent may cry for a second at the end when that soft, country song plays, we will be better for the experience of the film, as it is a nice story (ie: the idea of being able to see the loved ones we have lost again and live with them, side-by-side again and do the things we always did together), nicely told. The film offers a loving portrait of a father-son relationship. Some nice flashback images of John's childhood with his father (and mother and best friend, who we also see as older adults) complete the picture, making it watchable and endearing without being sappy or overly sentimental. Plus, the idea of the father and son team solving a case together as age contemporaries but in different &quot;times/eras&quot; was a new spin on an old formula, and I found it really interesting. Each storyline (the son who lost his father and was still grieving thirty years later, and the crime story), had enough good material for two solid, separate movies. Together, they create a really memorable, enjoyable movie experience. Another bonus here is the lack of real violence. I found it refreshing to see a thriller that was so suspenseful and entertaining and thought-provoking that it didn't have to rely onmindless violence to get its point across. Violence wouldn't have added to the story, and without it, the story sets itself apart from other films in the same genre with a more humanist, sensitive approach. The film definetely shines in that regard. This is also a movie that baseball fans will appreciate, as it has some interesting scenes involving the son foretelling some future (for the father) games.<br />As far as overall mood and tone go, the nearest film I can think of (the most similar) is the excellent The Sixth Sense. This movie is like that film, but without the ghosts. <br />The DVD features background data on phenomena such as Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights), Ham Radios, and the influence of solar events on such radio frequencies. The various people interviewed in the extensive extras are real scientists who know their stuff. This was definetely a loaded, interesting DVD.
B00003CXB2|5.0|There is nothing like watching this epic film on a large screen TV.  The scene of Lawrence coming out of the desert is amazing!!  What appears to be simply a shot of the horizon is actually a shot of Lawrence approaching after saving a Bedouin in the desert. He starts as a spec on the screen, which can be viewed in all of it's digital mastery only on the right entertainment center. This movie is incredible on DVD.
B000056K04|1.0|I'm listening to it for the second time.  I've had it for a month now.  It's awful.  It makes my ears bleed.  I just listened to Before These Crowded Streets, by most accounts not Dave and Co.'s best album, but it was one of mine.  The contrast is unbelievable.  One album has music on it.  The other is a collection of four minute pop songs, which wouldn't be so bad, except that there is a glaring lack of emotion from a band/artist that is best known for its emotionally captivating albums and performances.  I've never cared for brand-name producers like Glen Ballard, and this is exactly why...all sonic perfection, and no heart.  It's fine when he does this to Alanis Morrissette (who cares?), but for a fine musical ensemble like the DMB to succumb to his hollow ways is the most unfortunate thing to happen to music in years.  Don't waste your money.
B000059R8Y|4.0|I simply cannot get tired of listening to this CD: I lose myself in each and every song, words&amp;music resonate within me and connect me with my deepest self. It's amazing how a CD comes out and as if by magic my life at this very moment finds itself reflected in it. From the bottom of my heart: Thank You EC!
B00004Z459|5.0|Whether rock-rap or rapcore is going to live on for awhile or die off and fly into history next to other music genres that were short-lived remains speculated over constantly. I, personally, think that rock-rap will live on as long as it wants if talented artists like Linkin Park stay behind the wheel of it's driving force. Before anyone dares to stereotype this and throw it on the shelf next to their dust-growing KoRn albums, or their &quot;got way too old, way too fast&quot; Limp Bizkit CD's, this album DEFINITELY deserves several listens, although just one spin should get you hooked. How, you might ask? It's as simple as the fact that this is one of those rare albums where there simply is not a bad song on the entire thing. One can spin the entire CD without coming across a skippable track or a gut-wretching, space-filling interlude. Strictly no-BS here.<br />Leading the front of the group are Chester Bennington, with an amazing voice that would make Maynard James Keenan of Tool jealous, but with enough ferocity to scream his heart out on the level of some of today's loudest metal bands. Such a contrast is rare. Putting forth just as much contribution, and an equal frontman along Chester, is Mike Shinoda, strictly in charge of rap lyrics, who has the flowing ability, if not better, of most hip-hop artists. The crunching guitars of Brad Delson bring the metal part of the album to life, while Roub Bourdon's steady and fast-paced drums keep the beats so in check and so hip-hop oriented that one would swear it is a drum machine at points. However, the most bragging rights go to Joseph Hahn, the band's DJ. He can mix sound effects, cut records, and tear into his turntables with the same level of skill as DJ Lethal, among numerous others, all of which is gloriously reflected in the song &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;, performed only by Mr. Hahn. Strangely, the band didn't even have a permanent bass player during the recording, and had to hire a bassist for each song, but now, thankfully, a permanent bassist by the name of Phoenix has solved those problems.<br />But that's just where the band lies. The music itself is no typical rapcore. The emotionally charged lyrics on all the songs take the music to a level that Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst can't even dream of achieving. Adrenaline-pumping hard rock songs such as &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;With You&quot;, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; will silence the skeptical on the heavy metal matter. Mike Shinoda gets a chance to show off his flowing skills on &quot;Points Of Authority&quot;, &quot;By Myself&quot;, and co-operates on the rock vocals on &quot;Forgotten&quot;. More melodic, but by no means quieter or calmer songs include &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;A Place For My Head&quot;, and the album's finale &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;. The band's sound itself has influences from A Perfect Circle, Deftones, House Of Pain, Nine Inch Nails, Papa Roach, Videodrone, and numerous others.<br />In my opinion, the best songs on the album are &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Papercut&quot;, and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, although it's next to impossible to choose favorites, as every track is equally amazing. Don't stereotype this album with the rest of it's genre and forget about it. This is a must-have.

B000009QPE|5.0|... Yes, there are other albums in existence that may be more graphic, but does that make them better?  No, understand that Reign in Blood was released in 1986, no band at that time had ever recorded anything like this; Slayer was simply ahead of it time.<br />Now, of course you have all of these second-tier metal acts that sing about death, but its common now.  Its nothing goundbreaking.<br />And what makes reign in Blood great is the delivery, songwriting and riffs.  Really, no one has done it better.  Also, the album is not too short, its paced perfectly.  And the songs do sound different.  Sure, some of them may have similar rythyms, but the songs are supposed to connect together.  This is meant to be listened to as an album,it is not just a bunch of songs thrown together.  That is why on the cassette version all the songs are on one side.  <br />All the tracks are on this recording are great, however, the standouts are Angel of Death, Raining Blood, Jesus Saves, Criminally Insane and Reborn.<br />No other album has the same brutal delivery, killer riffs and superb sequencing.<br />Reign in Blood doesn't deserve all the acclaim its received; it deserves more.<br />Classis Albums Magazine
B00002Z88D|1.0|metallica blows they should be shot for releasing such a terrible album classical music does not mesh well with heavy metal look at led zeppelin they were terrible they didn't do true heavy metal and now we see metallica moving in the same direction pretty soon we're going to see the death of metal
B000002JSP|5.0|1979's In Through The Out Door was the first studio album had released in three years.  It unfortunately turned out to be their last as drummer John Bonham passed away not long after its release.  The album is something of a departure from the classic guitar crunch of their previous albums.  The songs are heavily laden with synthesizers and this is due to the fact that most of the backing tracks were laid down by John Paul Jones and Robert Plant.  Those two entered the studio before Jimmy Page and John Bonham and wrote most of the songs together.  &quot;In The Evening&quot; is a strong opening track with its driving track.  &quot;South Bound Suarez&quot; is a tad long, but it is a rollicking song.  &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; is one the catchy songs the band has ever recorded and Mr. Page contributes an excellent solo in the middle.  &quot;All Of My Love&quot; is a gorgeous song that Mr. Plant wrote about his late son.  &quot;Carouselamba&quot; suffers from too much synthesizer work and &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; are decent, but more or less forgettable tracks.  The experimentation with synthesizers was a nice change of pace from the bad, but sadly after John Bonham's death, the band was permanently silenced.  It would have been nice to see what direction the band would have taken in the 80's and further on.
B000005Z0G|5.0|The album is definitely one of Tupac's best. \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\\" is probably the best song he has ever written. That song alone gives the album five stars. This album was done prior to his major problems with the law and Biggie. This I believe displays his clearest thoughts. anyone who enjoys REAL music will enjoy this.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I would love to see Bruce live, but watching him on HBO was almost as good.  The CD is just as good.  The only problem I have with it is that &quot;Born to Run&quot; isn't even documented on the case or the CD.  What the hell is that?  Aside form that, this is welcome addition to my Springsteen collection.
B00004RF11|3.0|Danny Devito gave exellent effort in this movie. He acted and played a major roll in the making of it. He tried and compared to other kid movies it isn't that bad but the amazing talents of Dahl (the author of the book) can't be shown in this movie. I really didn't want to say this but the book was better. If u love the book it might be worth seeing it for a few scenes
6300214826|1.0|What happens when you mix a good director with a good cast and a boring, half-baked plot? You get \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" <br />AN's plot is too bizarre to have even a modicum of credibility and having seen this film a few times, I still don't get the point of it. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's a perfect fit for Marlon Brando mainly because the characters are dull and one-dimensional--much like Brando himself! Moreover, AN also suffers from bad directing and editing which makes it a rather difficult movie to follow. <br />For all its potential, AN never lives up to its hype and I fail to see why it received so much acclaim. For a war movie, AN doesn't have a lot of action so if you're a war movie buff, chances are it won't hold your interest. If anything, AN is about as interesting as watching dust settle on your VCR. Avoid it with extreme prejudice.

630021463X|2.0|I'll admit I'm not a Star Trek fan so I don't share the same level of enthusiasm for &quot;Star Trek IV--The Voyage Home&quot; as do some of the other people who've seen this film. &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; has been hyped as a funny film but after watching it, I'm still not sure what makes this film so funny. <br />OK, there are some amusing moments like when Spock tries to use late 20th century slang in his conversations or when Kirk and Spock sit next to a punk rocker with a loud boom box on the city bus. Other than that, there's really not much to laugh about in this film. <br />Still, from an objective critical point of view, this film does have its merits. &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; does have a half-way decent plot and there's also an element of drama when Chekov gets knocked out of action. Moreover, Scotty, Bones and the rest of the crew have more depth and dimension than they did in the original TV series--which makes for a more interesting film.<br />While &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is basically an OK movie, it still doesn't rise to its full potential. Still, if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll probably enjoy it and will want to add it to your video collection.
B000059MEK|1.0|We're some of us listening to dance music because of its freshness, its resistance to commercialism. Kind of the way grunge was at the beginning. Or punk, or hey, rock and roll. When Daft Punk shows up on the covers of ten of the best-circulated dance music magazines in existence in a six-week period, I start to worry. I buy the disc, and discover it's (1) really repetitive, (2) cheesy in an ironic but ultimately not engaging way, and (3) being touted as the new new thing in dance music. This stinks, man. This is what I listen to dance music to get away from. Sure, you can listen to it as a joke. But even then, why listen twice?

6301942647|1.0|This review crits the lack of a DVD version of this movie.<br /> DVD and digital projectors blow away both TV and HDTV.

B00004XQ83|5.0|It's all music.  Oh, these Lotos Eaters that try to sell you on one kind.  They will tell you that this is the real deal, as opposed to other kinds.  Forget the comparing.  People compare this stuff to ther stuff, as though it needs that to make it good.  This stuff rocks.  If you've ever loved music, this is a good bet.  Some of the high points for me are the Alison Krauss tunes(she goes solo, duo and trio), the ever present Man of Constant Sorrow, and the final piece, Angel Band.  ....The only thing I can say is that this is heart music.  I believe that music exists to bring joy, and this truly does.  ........The movie is about men searching, and all the music does that...it searches for the truths of human condition...it explores the heavenly kingdom, the sorrows of the world, through gospel, blues, and the roots of human existence....soothe your soul...the music is the siren dong to your salvation...........and the movie is fabulous too.
B000056K04|2.0|This cd is an average cd but not what we expect from Dave Matthews.  I never thaught DMB would turn into an MTV puppet but they have.  I am disapointed that the orriginal CD produced by Lillywhite was not released.  The record company execs and Dave felt that the Lillywhite CD was to depressing.  Well.... Depressing is better than this buttle gum garbage Dave threw at us and expects us to eat it up.  After hearing this CD I decided to sell my tickets to see Dave this summer.  I can't contribute to a man who alienates his fan base.  I do however like When the World Ends and Angel.  But the rest of this CD makes absolutely no impact on me when i listen to it.
B00000JPHE|4.0|This is a great movie, of course.  But if you are looking for the &quot;original&quot; version, this is not it.  The new music adds a lot, but at times I felt as if I was watching a music video or something.  In some ways it was really neat, but overall the music took away from the original creepiness.!
B000051VWW|5.0|When I saw that Sade was releasing a new CD i thaught it would be a disaster since its been so long since there last recording. However they proved me wrong. Sade's voice is still beautiful and whimsical. I love By Your Side.  It is one of the best songs I have heard in some time.  This CD is essential to all Sade fans.  If you thaught Love Deluxe was good wait till you hear Lover's Rock.
0393038912|3.0|I have two boys, ages 9 and 15. Although neither of them wanted to read Guns, Germs, and Steel, my reading of it  has led to some interesting conversations in our family. The book gives a good background to history in many parts of the world that I was not as familiar with as I should have been. As I`ve read the book, I've summarized his claims for my kids. It has led us to good discussions about the people that we have replaced on this continent, to question the concepts of race and intelligence, and to wonder just how white Europeans, who could certainly be savage and stupid themselves, came to conquer most of the world. Although I think that many of the author's claims are a bit too strong, it is still  a thought-provoking book.For a more complete review of the book, I'd have to agree with  the weaknesses mentioned by Christopher Smith in a review  on this website  posted on Jan. 24, 2001.
B0000508U6|4.0|This CD is a breath of Fresh Air on the Stale Music Scene that exists now.  Parachutes proves to be an excellant CD.  Yellow, the title track presents a new and exciting sound.  The other songs on this record expand on that sound and create masterpieces.  The rest of this CD is amazing and can be considered even better than the hit single Yellow.  My personal favorites are Don't Panic, Trouble, and Parachutes, the title track.  If anyone is looking for a new cd that will shine a new light on there CD Collection, this CD is an excellant choice.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|U-571 is all promise and no payoff.  A neat dramatic trick starts us out with instant tension between the sub captain (Paxton) and his executive officer (McConaughey)--so McConaughey's on a slow boil as the mission gets underway.  Things start to happen quickly enough, surprises lurk, and before you know it, you're really into the story.  But somewhere after the half-way mark, the movie navigates its way into familiar waters.  At times, it's almost like we're watching parts of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER all over again.  One of the crises McConaughey encounters is almost directly lifted from CRIMSON TIDE; another from DAS BOOT.   By the end, what had been a novel entry in the submarine sub-genre just barely limps back into port.   <br />The DVD is helped somewhat by a whole range of extra features, but it's still not enough to make you happy about the ending.   If anything, the director's commentary almost makes things worse by its blindness about the banality of the film's ending.  Worth getting only in this edition, because at least you'll learn a little something about filmmaking and the importance of Dino de Laurentis to the film industry.
B00005B1EX|4.0|Halford has returned to his roots, thank goodness. It is so good to hear Halford singing the old Priest tunes again.  His voice is tremendous, much better than Ripper's.  However, though his band is good, it  is no Priest.  Their sound is not as heavy or polished as Tipton and co.  However, it is still good, it just leaves you wishing for the Priest of old, with Halford at the helm.  A good effort overall, and Halford still is the METAL god. ...
B00003CX95|5.0|How much you like this film will depend largely semantics.  This historical drama is not very historical but it's an excellent drama.  So choose your word and get your review.  <br />If you like history, you're going to have problems with this movie.  To be sure, pains were taken to evoke an accurate \\"feel\\" of the times.  The way in which battles happened is generally more accurate and horrific than has been depicted in movies previously.  But on occasion, license is taken with the strategy and conduct of particular historical battles.  Indeed at times it's tempting to say this film was merely based on some rumors heard about William Wallace.  Certainly, the most egregious sin is how Robert the Bruce is treated.  Far from being accurately portrayed as the true savior of modern Scotland--and indeed the one individual most responsible for Scotland having never been conquered--he's seen as treacherous.  It fails to account how Robert the Bruce eventually triumphed over William Wallace's chief rival: Edward Longshanks, and indeed his successor.   Sadly, the movie never takes the time to explain William and Robert's twin importance; it just leaves us with the martyr and the snake.    And it's not like Gibson didn't have time in the film to give more attention to the Bruce/Wallace relationship.   This is a long film.  No, he actively chose to make a movie which was so centered on Wallace that it went over the line of truth.  <br />If, however, you're focusing more on the word \\"drama\\" than \\"historical\\", you'll have little to take exception to, here.  It's a great bit of filmmaking on that score, fully deserving of its many accolades.   Battle scenes have rarely been directed on Gibson's par, and the acting is consistently competent throughout.  However this film might warp your history, it's a deftly powerful work that will stay in your mind long after you watch it.<br />[DVD NOTES: A fine director's commentary and making-of featurette bring this puppy up a star, for me.On its own, I'd tend to take off one star for its historical problems, but the Oscar-winner's commentary tips the scales in this edition's favor.]

0441172717|5.0|In the early eighties I walked into the Grand Central Book Store in New York City and asked the salesperson for a recommendation for a &quot;good&quot; Sci-Fi book.  He said that he was a fan and recommended a book and author that I was not familar with. Every since that day I was a Dune and Frank Herbert fan.  I've read all the Dune books and enjoyed most of them but the orignal Dune is by far one of the best Science Fiction book to come along in a long time.   VERY POWERFUL.
0446608955|3.0|This is a book you want to have it on your bookshelf when outside is raining buckets and you are lying under a blanket and you have several hours to waste.  London Carter is first-person narrator of his life-love story when he was 17. He felt in love with a girl, minister daughter who seems to be extraordinary in ordinary sense. It is a novel of a differnce between rich everything-can-get kid and a humble girl with modest outfit and Bible at her side all the time. She's the girl he would never think that she would come across his mind nor even a heart. But she has. The story is developng slowly, sometimes it has pages you can easily skip as it seemst that they are there to fill the gap of making a proper middle-distance novel. I just found a lack of London's emotional involment into romance with Jamie. I missed something here, like the storyteller was not capable of bringing usuaslly exceptional emotional journey of a boy to your heart. But except that at the end of the book that story will make you sad and you will cry like a baby. It's pleasant read, but don't expect too much. Maybe it will remember you of opportunities you missed in your life which won't ever came back again.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I beliave this movie is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen. In fact it is my favorite. I beliave Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer were excilent. The put on a stunning preformince. I belieave that George Lucas and Ron Howard shoud team up and make a sequal to this epic tale. Infact i think the should tell more people about this movie so there arn't just a few people who know about this movie
B000058T5E|2.0|Made in USA in 2000, Serial# EK-61625, Playing Time 36:01<br />Let's get a few things out of the way up front: yes, I gave it 2 stars; yes, the CD is short; no, I didn't give it 2 stars to grab your attention. In any event, it'll be buried in the middle of hundreds of other reviews! I know I won't become a favorite reviewer with this one, but hey, it's just my opinion... <br />This disc is a logical follow-up to &quot;Who Else!&quot;, where JB gave us many surprises in musical direction, sounds, and well, everything. However, this time I thought it failed where &quot;WE!&quot; succeeded.<br />Sure, JB is a great guitar player: innovative, versatile, a virtuoso. But, I simply didn't enjoy it: I'm not a guitar player, so I'm not listening for complexity, techniques, tone, or whatever else a guitar player may pay attention to. I listen to the music (they don't have to be songs), and determine its impact on me (beats, emotions, dreams, whatever.) There are a few melodic tracks (like &quot;Nadia&quot; and &quot;Suspension&quot;), and 1 track I found to be somewhat &quot;constructed&quot;: &quot;Loose Cannon&quot;. The rest seem recorded in 1 take, almost improvised.<br />YHIC disappointed me on many levels: besides Jeff's playing, I found everything else fairly annoying: drum loops/rhythm machines / synthesized/MIDI arrangements, a few vocals here and there, no direction, no theme, basically: extremely good guitar performances layered on top of smudged backgrounds.<br />There, I said it.  I've got EVERY Jeff Beck album, and he demonstrates his abilities on this record extremely well; I just have to find a karaoke-like machine that removes everything but Jeff's emotionally intense and amazing guitar work.<br />That's why I found it so difficult to rate this album: almost every track has something exciting, and something annoying. Sorry, but the latter won...
0064407667|5.0|In this context &quot;gas&quot; meaning a great time.  While Iwas searching, one of the thngs they said they were excited about coming out was the seventh book in the &quot;Unfortunate Events&quot; series.After just finishing the first I can see why. I desperately want to start the second, to see what unlucky fate next befalls the three Baudelaire siblings, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Three very unlucky children whose parents die tragically and are forced to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf. Imagine Harry Potter never getting the chance to escape from the Dursley's and you'll get the general idea. The author relates their tale of woe with hilarity, including a technique of providing definitions for words that the reader might not be familiar with. Destined to become cult classics and handsomely designed and illustrated in their little hardback form, they're books you're kids/niece/nephew/little sibling will want all of. And you'll be sneaking them away to see what all the fuss is about.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I like this cd kinda. it is ok. i like some of the songs on the cd like Full Nelson, My Generration, Hot Dog, rollin, and my way. i used to like Limp until they turned into rap rock. i want to Family Faluies tour and saw them they were pretty good live. more anger and stuff. but that doesnt really matter. i bought this cd. it was not a waste but not my favorite. it is kind of rap that is bad enough but then it turned into mallcore music. i think it is your choice to buy this. cause im not asking you to. if you are a metal fan and you have herd of this dont buy it. it isnt that tipe. so if you want to buy it you can i am not forceing you to but you can.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesday's With Morrie is a book that I feel teaches a great deal about the lessons of life. Throughout the whole book, it makes you sit back and look at life with a whole new outlook. It is about a College Professor named Morrie, who is a fun, loving, and energetic individual. He is well liked by everyone! Morrie is in his seventies when he is told he has ALS, a disease slowly taking over his body from his feet up, until he no longer has any feeling in his body. Morrie has many visitors in his final stages,and one was Mitch Albom,a former student of Morrie's. They had a very close relationship in the past and Mitch promised him that he would keep in touch. It took Mitch many years and a nightline show to finally get him to visit Morrie.  They then make it a date, every Tuesday they will meet, until the last. They talk about the meaning and values of life. Morrie helps Mitch to realize all of the important things in life and not to take things for granted. He quotes &quot;Once you learn to live, you learn to die&quot;. I feel that this quote sums up the book. Morrie has lived a good life, but when he is told he only has so long to live, he wants to spend as much time as he can with the ones he loves. He learns to appreciate all the small things in life and make the best of every day. I really enjoyed this book and learned about what to value in my life.
B0000085N4|4.0|What a sound! The last of the great guitar driven music since the Nuge reigned and before that grunge drivel was unleashed on the unsuspecting masses? &quot;Sonic&quot; seems to have a little of a lot of the great hard rock bands influences in full attack mode on this one.
1567406831|4.0|Whether you are old or young, you always need someone watching over you in life.  Someone needs to give you advice when times are rough, have a shoulder for you to cry on, and encourage you while you succeed.  You need help in paving a road of moral values, and guidance in setting your priorities in line.  Most of all, As you go through life, you need friends.<br />In Tuesdays With Morrie, Morrie befriends Mitch during college.  Morrie was a tremendous influence on Mitch and taught him several life lessons.  Mitch was excited to learn, and take Morrie's courses.  Mitch learned social skills, reasons for people's actions, and the truth of society.  However, after graduating from college, Mitch lost many lessons that he was taught. After hearing of Morrie's disease, Mitch returns to his old professor.  Morrie helps him to re-evaluate his life, and get his tracks back inline.  <br />Tuesdays With Morrie is the most encouraging book that I have ever read.  Humor is mixed with drama, and every thought that comes from Morrie is applicable to my own life.  I was fascinated with the truth of our culture that was revealed, and Morrie's love and passion for people.  I have recomended this book to several of my friends, not only for a good read, but also to sooth some of the hard times that life delivers.
B00004R99R|4.0|No, the film didn't portray the mythical characters accurately. But if children who enjoy the movie now, they may be inspired to read about the Greek Myths behind it later. I loved the observation Phil and Herc made of the disgruntled citizens of Thebes,(&quot;Don't even get me started on the crime rates!&quot;) and the appropriately irritating mannerisms of Hades'Disney-made henchmen, Pain and Panic. Children don't need exposure to the graphic slaying of the Hydra, but adults will enjoy the snide repartee of the characters. As for the singing,I found the Gospel and early 1960's pop styles to be well done. (Incidentally, the comments of an earlier reviewer regarding Michael Crawford and Mel Gibson intrigue me. It looks as though we have similar tastes in favorite entertainers.)
0385484518|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book and never wanted to put it down while I read it.  I found this to be a very inspirational book, a type of book that could change your view on some things. Morrie was a very unique individual who took great interest in his job.  I don't think that Morrie actually considered his job to be a real job.  He didn't go be a Professor each day just to get a paycheck.  He wanted to teach his students the lessons that he learned in life and share his experiences with them.   I thought that they way Morrie and Mich were reunited was very unique.  It was said that Mitch only made time for Morrie after he saw him on a T.V. special because he was dying, but I think it turned out well because it at least brought them some time together before Morrie died. Morrie had his days when he was good and his days when he was bad.  Overall, Morrie handled the fact that he was dying very well.  He quoted, &quot;once you lern how to die, you learn how to live,&quot;  I think that this is very true and Morrie was fortunate enough to be able to learn how to die since he knew he had an illness and was dying.   Overall, I definately give this book 5 stars!!  Parts of this book will make you laugh while others will make you cry.  I think this book will definately change your outlook on life!  Everyone should read Tuesdays with Morrie!
0140177396|5.0|From the first page I fell in love with John Steinbeck's way of writing - his humble and delicate language. <br />In this sweet novel Steinbeck has created an interesting set of characters and he chose to set the novel a few miles south of Soledad (loneliness in Spanish) in the 1930's. It tells the story of the two friends, George (the smart one) Lennie (the dumb one), whom have no family, and no place that they can call \\"home\\". To make a living Lennie and George work on the different farms around, trying to save up money. They have a dream of buying a place of their own.. A piece of land where they can grow their own crop and where Lennie can have rabbits. It is this dream that keeps these two friends going. <br />This short novel captures you easily. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a touching and sad story about friendship and the need for everyone to belong. Well written and highly recommended!

We were interested in the title &quot;Excalibur&quot; because in school you have to do a unit on &quot;Medieval Times&quot; and that day we had just read a story on King Arthur.  Me and Steven both enjoyed this movie which is funny in some parts and very bloody in some parts as well.  We highly recommend this movie.  As it is a very good story and has a never-stopping- action plot.  In every scene you are glued to your seat.  If you are interseted in King Arthur, Merlin, or the knights of the round table this is the movie for you!

1878424319|5.0|Not since Steve Chandler's &quot;17 LIES&quot; has a book really contained all you need to start a refreshingly new life.  The four agreements you make with yourself are hard to keep, very very hard to keep. But the good news is that they are simple to remember and simple to apply once you're committed.  This wisdom is not nebulous new age frosted spirituality or mock metaphysics.  This book is not for the mystical or the lazy. This book is like the Marines in boot camp for your mind. It is as hard core as an abdominal workout. But once you finish, boy do you flow, do you ever just flow through your life.
B00003W8NM|1.0|Yes, I'm a dude, and yes, I did see past its violence. And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm  not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that. To justify violence by millions of air-headed jocks is wrong. Let the negative feedback come on!<br />) of 3584689 users found this review helpful
0553260111|5.0|Robert Ludlum shines with this masterpiece. It's about a secret agent who suffers amnesia after a terrible experience. He has to find out who he is before the crushing,timebombing cluster of pursuers get to him. Ludlum intricately weaves the story into a tapestry of excitement,action and suspense. This is for keeps. Highly entertaining.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Yes, I'm reviewing this again because my first review wasn't really a review. Anyway, ROC is my favorite ATDI album, and anyone who isn't deaf probably agrees that ATDI are the most fresh and innovative bands out there. At first listen they sound like a mix of Rage with the Beastie Boys, and after many listens, they still do in a way. However, ATDI don't attempt to rap at least. The music contained is so thrilling, really. I actually like Cedric, he doesn't get on my nerves and his voice is listenable for the most part (he's got the emo-yell down pat though-and sometimes overuses it) Okay, the really good songs are the first seven. The first one is ok, Pattern Against User rules. It sounds a LOT like One Armed Scissor, but more diverse with a great chorus. One Armed Scissor is a great single, from the really cool intro to the breakdown at the end. Sleepwalk Capsules is THE best ATDI song EVER! It blows away anything before ROC and most of what's on ROC. I mean, have you ever heard a band sing a song with so much heart? It took me a few listens to appreciate it, and now I love it so much. Cedric is really a good singer/yeller, and the really cool guitar solo is great in the middle. Invalid Litter Dept.  is a slow one, very Vaya-ish, but with some cool lyrics. The end part of ILD is really cool, Cedric yells his ass off for like 20 seconds. Mannequin Republic this sudden burst of energy, clocking in at just barely 3 minutes but so packed. Then, Rolodex Proproganda slows things down a bit with the little hostage-intro, and is the last of the great songs. All the others are ok I guess, the only standout of the later tracks are Cosmonaut. ROC is one of my favorite albums of 2000 because it's true music in every shape and form.
1573228214|5.0|Early on in the story, Rob says, &quot;Whan came first- the music or the misery? Did I listen to music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to music? Do all those records turn you into a melancholy person?&quot; As I often wonder the same thing, this quote struck me. A few people I know listen to angry music all the time; they are not the happiest of people. Because they listen to angry music, are they angry as a result, or is there just some comfort to be had in relating to the music? I believe there is a delicate balance between the two (sort of a Yin and Yang relationship). For instance, when I am happy, I like to listen to more upbeat music. However, when I am in a bad mood,   that same music also helps to cheer me up. How music affects a person is subject to the context of the situation (whether a person is happy, depressed, etc...).
B00002E285|5.0|The Wall is not an ordinary movie.  Instead of regular dialog and plot, the movie is a visual experience of the album of the same name.  The movie explores the darkest parts of the human mind and forces the viewer to consider many ideas he or she may rather not think about.  Animation combined with video, all casted in time with the music to Pink Floyd's album, The Wall, this movie must have truely been difficult to direct and create.<br />Several of the movie's producers do not share my opinion of the film, and even Roger Waters himself expressed dissatisfaction with The Wall, but I see the movie as a masterpiece.
6304696566|2.0|Passable western, if you do not mind the racist portrayal of Native Americans, combined with the simplistic and turgid dialogue.  A rather unbelievable film, I can think of many other westerns, new and old that fit the western bill better.  I would recommend &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, &quot;Unforgiven&quot;,even Wayne's &quot;rio bravo&quot; are superior to this junk.  Oh yes, an Italian named Sergio Leone made better westerns than mr. Ford and Mr. Wayne.<br />Takes all the western stereotypes and mixes in bad acting, what a sorry stew!
6305807043|5.0|In all my years as a film-art student I have yet to see a finer example of Post -Freudian Existentialism in cinema! A fist rate film! Acting is kept to a believeble but subtle mean to allow for the transvergence of comic delivery. I love the straight faces and dead pan comedy in this movie. I want to see more like it! If you like low angle &quot;box&quot; style photography you are in for a treat too! This film is essentially art within art; context within context and culmination within culmination. Some great puppet work too, from a master of the art. If you want a plot that rivals &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and a subtle blend of character that upstages &quot;Please Brush My Seed, My Donkey Has Become A Jackdaw&quot; then you want to see this classic. &quot;Being John malkovich&quot; is unique! see it and you know you have seen the best in cinematography and plot EVER. And it's based on a true story too!
B00005B1EX|5.0|I cannot believe Rob Halford can still sing like this.  This will sound far fetched, but this is the best vocal performance of his recording career.  He sings portions of &quot;Light Comes Out of Black&quot; a full octave higher than the original recording (check out the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; soundtrack).  Again, as hard to believe as this sounds, he totally outsings the incredible &quot;Unleashed In the East&quot; (Judas Priest, 1979).  He is a much better singer today than he has EVER been.  Forget about  playing it safe live and not going for those high notes, he sings BETTER than he does in the studio!  There are singers out there that can sing high, but Rob Halford does something magical and god-like with those notes that I have never heard anyone else do.  No wonder so many great vocalists  look up to him.  I am shaking my head in disbelief...what an incredible talent.
0385335482|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's quick witted Confessions of a Shopaholic is an enjoyable read, but don't be fooled by its superficial appearance. Ms. Kinsella has raised some very crucial issues with regard to personal finances, responsibility and credit in this wonderful, fast-paced and light-hearted romp through London's finest boutiques, department stores and Starbucks-like coffee houses about the consumer based/commericial culture that dominates the western world. I found myself laughing with Ms. Kinsella's main character Becky Bloomwood as she explained that she purchased things but always had two prices for them: what she actually paid and what she TOLD her mother she paid (usually calculated at about 70% off a half priced item) and crying with Becky as her monthly credit card statements arrived and she confronted, in writing, the reality of her total expenditures for the month.<br />While Ms. Kinsella makes it clear that Becky has no problem spending money she does not already have (i.e. a credit purchase), she also takes pains to show that the credit card companies are delighted to extend Becky much more credit than her salary would justify as reasonable. Even when Becky does not pay off her balances, the credit card companies continue to entice her with balance transfers, free gifts and things such as airmiles to use their product. The question of why extend credit to someone who is having difficulty repaying or really could never have been expected to repay a debt greater than her salary just hangs there. Yes, Becky Bloomwood put herself in the situation, but her creditors did little to help this young woman, fresh out of college, educate herself to avoid getting there in the first place. <br />Confessions of a Shopaholic is a fun way to be enlightened about the dangers of debt and quite frankly has really helped me to make a conscious decision to charge something before I automatically put it on the credit card - and wait in dread until the Visa bill arrives to see thedamage I've done.
0441172717|5.0|Herbert's Dune is truly one of the best books I have ever read.  It has everything in it that one could want: war, heroes, futuristic technology, villains, suspense, you name and Dune probably has it.  I strongly recommend the book over the movie.  There is far more detail in the novel and you gain a better understanding of who everyone is and what the different people are about.  The copy of the book I have has a dictionary of words that you may not understand, and it has a map so you can see roughly where each scene takes place.  Herbert was able to keep my attention throughout the whole book and the way it was written kept me glued to the book and it never seemed like it was as long as it really is, about 500 pages.  I thought that it had strong similarities to a Star Wars type story; however, it was at the same time completely different.  I would recommend this book and I plan on reading some of the others in the series.
0553277472|4.0|Dear All,<br />As is always helpful I have read the book a couple of times now. I have also read the highly mixed reviews varying from coffee-shop boredom and a philosophy teachers irritation to some people who have genuinely loved this book. I must say that I can sympathise in part with both views. Indeed, if you have already formed some views on philosophy (and you may not be aware that you have) then be prepared, for you may be in for a few irritating moments. However, as is demonstrated by so many who have read and reviewed this book it has been a source of immense enjoyment and for many it seems to have changed their lives for the better. I am not going to bore anyone with the rigours of whether his philosophy is consistent or not but I will say that I am glad that he offers some healthy scepticism to many of todays accepted views. <br />If you want philosophy, do read the book but remember that many of the views are contentious. In other words read with your eyes open and make your own minds up. As some of the less than happy readers have pointed out, there are many good books on philosophy so don't forget about those.<br />As for whether you will be bored or not I think that it is quite clear from the reviews, varying from 5 star to 1 star, that you will just have to read it to find out. I hope you do not find the experience to be a waste.

0451160916|5.0|Stephen King is no doubt a hugely successful writer, however he is not often recognized an author with skills that reach beyond his genre.  In The Shining, Stephen King shows more than just his ability to make you sleep with your lights on.  I am the first to admit that The Shining is by far one of the scariest novels I have ever read, but what adds to its greatness is ability to operate on many levels. The novel leaves the reader completely satisfied with a good scare and a pertinent story.  The novel focuses on the Torrance family.  Jack, the father, is writer with a temper who recently lost his job.  Jack has been sober for almost a year and he is offered a job to take care of a hotel in Colorado in its off season.  The family, along with his wife Wendy and their son Danny who has a very special gift, look at the job as an opportunity to regroup and get Jack writing going.  Danny has a gift that allows him to see things that are going to happen in the future and sense things that most people can't.  His gift gets a name eventually and is called the shining.  The novel is structured in a five-act play type of format and the action never ceases with every turn of the page.  In contrast to the film, which is successful in its own right, the novel doesn't focus on Jack (played by Jack Nicholson in the film) as the antagonist, but rather the conflict comes with the hotel versus the entire Torrance family. In order for the family to move on they must face the horrible things in their past.  The hotel as they find out has a past and the family experiences unimaginable terror as they are stranded in the hotel during the harsh Colorado winter.  Jack develops a fascination with the hotel and becomes more and more interested in history darker history.  The Hotel uses Jack as instrument to get to Danny.  The only thing they can't help the Torrance family is binding to together and facing the Hotel's past as well as their own.  The setting, as usual, shows King's mastery at picking places that we all might have had a fear of from time to time.  On another level the choice of the hotel is perfect in trying to represent a place that could have an amazing past.  Any number of things could happen in a hotel because of different kinds of people that could have inhabited its rooms. King also establish rich characters and as Jack Torrance gets to his brink you fear and feel sympathy for him at the same time.  Stephen King has not only mastered his craft in fear but he takes this novel a step further by having a family face their own past.  Everyone has something that haunts them in their past and the only way to find out if the Torrance family is successful conquering theirs is to face your own fears and read this book.hows King's mastery at picking places that we all might have had a fear of from time to time.

0440178002|5.0|On the list of top-ten, this may be number one.  Everyone should read this book.  I'd advise it for those over 15, because some of the content is hard to understand, and there is a language transition.  But it is a great story, and it really keeps one thinking and reading.  It places you in the middle of Japan as you follow the soon-to-be-intermingled lives of dozens of characters.  There is English piliot Blackthorne, who ends up on Japan's shore by mistake and ends up bending the situation to fit his own needs.  There is the brilliant japanese genral, Lord Toranaga, who keeps all the characters under his thumb.  There is Mariko-san, who unwittingly becomes tangled in a romantic plot of her own.  There is the Father Alvito, who is working for the benefit of his church, and nothing will stand in his way... or so he thinks.  As all these plots meet and unfold, readers will find themselves turning the pages to unravel the next battle, the nexy mystery, the next occurence.
B00004YKUY|3.0|[....]Augeri, though a good singer and can pull off Perry covers, lacks a hard drive vocal to sell these songs for me.  As I listened more and more, I find myself trying to hear Perry in some of the hard rockers for me to like the songs.  The ballads are well written and Augeri can bring a softness to make them enjoyable.  Perhaps they are trying to bring a new sound to edge out Perry but it will take some time.  Neal schon kick [butt] as usual.  hats off to the effort
B0000070SN|5.0|Hawkwind weren't the original heavy rock band; nor were they the first psychedelic/space rock group.  But they did what they did with such style that it doesn't really matter that the particular brand of psychedelia exhibited on 'Space Ritual' had all but died out three or four years previously.  Mercifully the heavy guitar riffage courtesy Dave Brock was very much in fashion in 1972 and indeed still is.  That is not to take anything away from the lyrics however.  Doubtless they are not to everyone's tastes but one tends to find the science fiction poetry interludes entertaining rather than irritating (in the inner sleeve, Hawkwind member Bob Calvert is credited with contributing 'poet[ry] and swazzle' to the proceedings), but few would disagree that the real power of 'Space Ritual' lies in the riffs.  And the riffs keep on coming to such an extent that there is almost an embarrassment of riches over the two discs as the monolithic yet splendid guitar licks come one after another.  'Master Of The Universe' on disc 2 is a particular highlight as is Nik Turner's 'Brainstorm' that brings disc 1 to a close.  The quality of the recording is hardly top notch but it all seems to add to the atmosphere.  The album is a thrilling ride over the whole two discs with little space wasted until the very end of disc 2.  All of disc 1 and the first six tracks on disc 2 seemlessly run together with breathtaking coherency - the album is an experience not just a collection of songs. So why then are inferior versions of 'Master Of The Universe' and 'Born To Go' - both to be found elsewhere on the album - needlessly tacked onto the end? It's not that the versions are bad, they are just not as good - one is advised to program them out when listening.  Overall tremendous album really is a must for all fans of psychedelia and metal.
B000053VAF|5.0|First of all, I'm really sick and tired of all the religious people complaining about this movie. They say that it's &quot;trash&quot; and an insult to all Catholics. Get it through your heads: IT'S A MOVIE! It's supposed to be entertaining, and it is! It's probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. Jason Lee gives an absolutely incredible performance as Azrael, a demon. It's one of the best performances I've ever seen in any movie. So please, rent or buy this movie. It's totally worth every penny.
B000003S5H|5.0|The simplest ideas are indeed the best and 'Moon Safari' is something of a simple idea: Hitherto unknown French duo Jean-Benoit Dunckel and Nicolas Godin get together in Paris and London and record cracking album of self-penned acoustic and synthesizer oriented, jazzy, ambient anthems and almost put Gallic music on the map. The album became an instant hit with critics and record buyers alike and is a perfect 'morning-after' record - particularly the stunning opener 'La Femme D'Argent'. It clocks in at over seven minutes in length and is a neat summation of what is to come over the following nine tracks. The electric piano (played by Dunckel) and the bass (Godin) meander to excellent effect and help make 'La Femme D'Argent' a rainy day classic. The musicianship is excellent throughout and Dunckel and Godin are shrewd in their combination of acoustic guitars and pianos and synthesizers - 'All I Need' being an excellent example. The aforementioned also features Beth Hirsch who gives a beautifully sensitive and unintrusive turn on vocals. She reappears on the later track 'You Make It Easy' which introduces some actually French sounding music to proceedings with the string and harmonica break in the middle. The following track 'Ce Matin La' carries on the theme of Gallic melancholia with beautiful results and soon becomes one of the best tracks on the album with the mellow tuba part achieving the greatest sound here. One suspects that Air will be here to stay for a while following the success of such an assured and strident debut recording - indeed the boys Dunckel and Godin have been busy fellows since 1998 writing soundtracks etc. - but can any future recording from them match the joyous warmth and mellow vibes exhibited in 'Moon Safari'?
B00004XONN|2.0|This new Radiohead album is nothing like their earlier work.  It has the slight electronica feel of their previous 2 albums, but the music on this album is not nearly as varied as any of their other albums.  Kid A is extremely laid back, which is nice at times, but at 50 minutes, this is a boring listen.  I recommend their first 3 albums, and both EPs (My Iron Lung and Airbag) before this album.  Then, if you want more Radiohead, give this a spin.  Just keep your expectations at the level of background music, (e.g. Enya, Eno) which is unfortunate since these guys have the ability to write songs that command your attention.
B00004YW6I|4.0|I don't write many reviews but thought I'd throw in my 5 cents worth about this wonderful album. Although it isn't the most original music PJ has made, it is one hell of a listen from beginning to end  -- It's just too damn catchy not to tap your foot along to and hum with. While PJ's dabbling into electronica-tinged music from the previous two records was quite good, neither, I feel, is like a shot (of rock n' roll) in the arm when I need it. If you like a mix of acoustic, thoughtful tunes with barreling-ahead rock and roll full of emotion and intelligent lyrics, then grab this album NOW.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I hate to sound like a film elitist, but this is NOT, I repeat, NOT a bad film -- so ignore those pathetic (and unreasonable) one star reviews below.  In fact, Steven Soderbergh's descent into the drug trade is absolutely brilliant, giving us the lowdown from all angles.  Beautiful cinematography, top notch acting from a talented ensemble cast, and simply good filmmaking on so many differently levels.  Traffic is definitely worth buying and it should have won best picture.
B000056K04|1.0|After posting a five star review of this album and praising the band for &quot;changing&quot;, I listened to Everyday over and over again. But something happened:  I realized this CD really, really stinks.  I never cared for the Glen Ballard/Dave Matthews pairing at all and now I really hate what Ballard has done.  His production WAS magical with Alanis Morissette and now she has decided to go alone for her next record.  After hearing Everyday, I don't blame her.  Ballard and Matthews have striped the emotion from the songs and have created Backstreet Boy songs which is fine, only that I thought DMB was a &quot;real&quot; band.  Ballard's previous work with Alanis was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is the last thing from &quot;mainstream&quot;, but his work with Matthews is just that.  Why did Dave and his band have to create an album so uninspired and geared towards top 40 radio fans?  I was really excited for them to come to my city to play, but that was before this pathetic album hit stores.
B00000IAU3|4.0|How does that old adage go--good things come to those who wait? That would certainly be the case with Dido.  I remember the first time that I heard 'Here With Me'--long before it was ROSWELL's theme song--on a modern rock station in '99, and thought, what a cool song.  Too bad it took Eminem sampling 'Thank You' to make people sit up and take notice--this album is deep with great music.  Her voice is very reminiscent of Ruth-Ann's(from the group Olive), and her music is somewhat along the lines of Sarah McLachlan, only slightly less pretentious.  A very strong effort.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Simply Excellent!  I bought this CD around Christmas time of last year and it is all I play.  Savage Garden have originality which goes well with the melodic songs they write and sing.  Can't wait for their next album!
B000002BPS|5.0|My favorite track is 'Meaning of Life,' which is the very best non-political punk (best punk song overall, I'd say 'Die for your Government' by Antiflag). 'I Choose' 'Disclaimer' 'Amazed' and 'Gone Away' are all great songs. 'All I Want' and 'Cool to Hate' I just wanna blast at one person at my school, along with 'Ruiner' by Nine Inch Nails. 'Way Down the Line' is good, but i think that 'The Grouch' by Green Day is a better representation of the fear of turning into your parents. 'Leave it Behind' I dont really like, because its hard to leave behind people saying they want you dead. Anyway, its just a great album. Get it now!
B00003ETJQ|5.0|For some, music is not &quot;truly&quot; music unless there`s singing, melody, and a linear accessible pop structure. Or that only good movies have Hollywood actors with mainstream sensibilities. Formula, mediocrity, and lack of imagination: this is capitalist McCulture as we see it in USA Today.<br />BARAKA has no actors, no words, no glossy Hollywood faces. It`s non-linear, has no &quot;plot&quot;, but clearly a message to whomever views it with the right eye. It is High Art.<br />It is deep. Subtle. Complex. Profound. Timeless. Mystical. Horrifying. Achingly beautiful. I also wish to describe it as universal but I won`t, because from my experience most people in the mainstream just won`t GET it. This is not a judgement. It is an observation.<br />Though I came away from the movie feeling that I`ve just witnessed a timeless universal masterpiece, when I showed the movie to a relative, his reaction was quite upsetting to me initially. ALL he saw was the surface and technical aspects of the film/making i.e. &quot;woah dude, an eclipse&quot; or (ignorantly)&quot;that tribsman`s getting groovy&quot;. I later came to realize that not everyone will come away from this movie with the same response. It`s not that he was wrong in his opinion; it`s the fact that he didn`t have the faculty for understanding and/or appreciating such a movie.<br />BARAKA communicates to you what cannot be communicated through words. It is a movie that can only be grasped in its totality, profundity and significance on an intuitive level. Fricke is clearly aware of the limitation of words. Like all the greatest works of art, BARAKA points away toward a direction that is more profound than the object of your observation. I`m not a Christian, but to use the necessary language, this is GOD communicating to You. The closeup image of a Japanese snow monkey, incredibly human-like, resting, meditative, still, aware, awake, ever present, is probably the most beautiful and eloquent capturing of Buddhahood I`ve ever witnessed on film.<br />I could not talk for two days after watching BARAKA for the first time. I felt as if I`ve left my body. It hit me that hard. It shows what crazy times and the crazy world we live in, that it is both full of horror and beauty, and will always be because to know what beauty is we must be aware of that which is not.<br />As for the content of the DVD, I have to give it a C or 2½ stars. This is unfortunate and unusual since Baraka has become quite the cult favourite in repertory cinemas around the country and for audiences worldwide. The DVD does not do justice for the type of curiousity fans like myself want to fulfill. The movie was well over five years in the making from what I`ve read and only eight minutes have been devoted to the featurette. I`d say a least a half hour should go towards this considering how long the movie took to complete. Also, a director`s commentary would have been most satisfying - I can`t imagine Ron Fricke having nothing to say during the making of the film as we`re watching the movie, I mean, he`s put his heart and soul into this project and has had immense complications for it`s actualization. <br />Nonetheless, for me, it is up there with the greatest works of art/cinema in this century. And if you can, try to watch it in the theatre with, hopefully, a good sound system. <br />And you don`t need to be an &quot;artsy fartsy&quot; to appreciate it!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I won't go into all the nitty-gritty details about the plot and the actors.  I'll simply say that if you are a DVD collector who loves action films with strong plots, then get Gladiator.  Even if you aren't a great fan of action, you still need this movie.<br />I have watched it several times since purchasing the DVD and it has gotten better each time.  The power, courage, and drama of this film is simply outstanding.
6304082428|5.0|I was a big fan of the novel Pride and Prejudice.  A lot of times when I like a novel, I do not enjoy the movie adaptation. That is not the case with this one.  It is a very well acted rendition of the novel. Previous movie adaptations were shorter but they cut out scenes from the novel which were important to the story.  I found this adaptation it to be humerous, sad &amp; moving --all in all extremely entertaining.
B0000584V3|4.0|&quot;Blackwater Park is the best opeth album so far&quot;, I keep hearing. (from reviews on the web, not here since it seems I am the only one hear who even knows who Opeth is). But it seems that I hear that statement about every successive Opeth album. My Arms is by far their worst (but still good compared to all the crap that passes for extreme music these days like Cradle of Filth, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson, and all power metal). Now people say that with Blackwater Park, Opeth is getting closer to sellng out. People say, &quot;Opeth is leaving the death growls behind&quot;. To these people, please listen to orchid and Morningrise and shut up. In my opinion, this disc is actually better than Still Life, but not by much. <br />Just listen to the title track. There's is not one clean word on that song. I have been a fan ever since I found a CD in the store with noting more than two flowers on it and I bought and loved it. Now people are finding Blackwater Park and then saying &quot;Oh, by the way, buy Orchid and Morningrise.&quot; It should be the other way around, but such is life   Many people will dimiss Opeth after this album because they feel the are treading the same path as Metallica and Korn. I certainly hope not. All we have to do is keep the nu-metallers and MTV away from Opeth. Blackwater park is far too good to be played on MTV. Lets leave MTV to the nu-metallers, power metallers and Cradle of Filth, and Manson
B000002UA5|3.0|I bought this album right around my 13th birthday back in 1970. It sure knocked me for a loop back then. I didn't play it all that much (with the exception of the live sections) until 4 years later. For the most part, the studio material is a real hodgepodge of half baked musical and non musical ideas. This is not the stuff that one would associate with Pink Floyd, the rock icons, yet I'm perversely drawn back to it from time to time. I don't expect today's 20 year old to get &quot; Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving Withe A Pict&quot; Unless of course, he has it blasting from his car stereo and is cow tipping with his friends at 3am under the influenece of Window Pane LSD, and no, this is not an endorsement of such behavior :)~ But I digress.   The live part of the album is really quite good. &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot; &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and &quot;Saucer full Of Secrets&quot; are classic acid drenched Floyd. The began to refine and tone down that aspect of their sound with each passing release after this.  Why only 3 stars? I give the live half 4 and the studio half 2. Mainly because Timothy Leary's dead
0440219078|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Giver, the content was always moving along nicely, and was never dull. The writing was witty and had a nice touch of realism to it. The story wasn't to hard to understand but it was very bizzare: a young boy living in a controled community, the community controls everything, no colors, no lanscapes, no animal, no nothing, they don't have this stuff because those type of thoughts could mess up the peacefulness of the community. This boy has ben given the task to have the memories of the outside world. He will get these memories by a man that already has the memories who transfers the memories to him. The only problem I have with this book, is that it rushes into everything too quickly, and seems to not talk to detailful about what is going on.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is an awsome book!  It has a very interesting and controversial story.  I could not put this book down.  It is very controversial in that it talks about the idea of abortion, comunism, and the world of sameness.  If you are like me you will enjoy arguing and disscussing the meaning of this book with others who have read it.  I recomend this book to all people in the 8th grade or higher because it is so controversial.
B000059POY|3.0|To paraphrase Brando in a much much better movie, this film could have been a contender. After its mainstream publication in 1964, the source novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg was initially under development at United Artists with Frank Perry (hot off David and Lisa)as director. Southern wrote an early screenplay with the hope that an American actress like Hayley Mills, Tuesday Weld or Jane Fonda would be cast. Well, as often happens in La La land, things change. French actor and Brando pal, Christian Marquand, became interested in the project when things went into turnaround. He managed to convince Brando and a cast of A-list talents - Coburn, Burton, John Huston, Matthau - to enlist. However, he jettisoned the idea of an American actress for the pretty, but woefully inept Ewa Aulin. By the time shooting commenced, Southern had moved on to Barbarella and Easy Rider. Buck Henry gets the script credit, but appears to be doing little more than exercising damage control as Marquand set up a series of sub-Fellinesque riffs. The first and last five minutes of Candy are promising bookends for a garish series of painfully unfunny episodes that are pale distortions of the novel's picaresque brillance. Still as a case study of how not to adapt a cult novel, Candy is still worth watching. The transfer is very good, but even the talent files admit the film is pretty awful.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Ripley returns as the only survivor of the cargo freightor Nostromo. She finds shes been drifting in black space for 57 years and that the planet LB-426 has a colony on it in which her former employers, a greedy corporation has just lost contact with. When they ask for Ripley's assistance and expertise she is skeptical but agrees. The marines corp moves in and finds the colony abandoned, but by the condition the place is in they can tell something went wrong.The only survivor, a little girl named Newt. As fear builds and Ripley and the crew are led once again into a trap by the corporation they realize they must kill the aliens and their queen and nuke the place morbid to put an end to their torrential reign upon LB-426. My idea of a good late night edge of your seat classic thriller  a plus of this movie from the others is the fact that now there is more than just one type of alien and there all nasty but the queen is the best of them all. This movie is a must have to any alien fan and my personal favorite of all the ALIENS films.<br />     &quot;GET AWAY FROM HER YOU B****&quot; Lt. Ripley-ALIENS
B000002KLP|5.0|It was awesome then and now!   Imagine yourself 18 years old driving your car with your friends to the beach, it's after 9:00 p.m....you're jamming to the sound of &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;...under the moonlight drinking a few &quot;cold ones&quot; and dancing to Party Up, Uptown, Head, When You Were Mine.  We laughed at &quot;Sister&quot; the most explicit song known to man...the one song that probably made the entire world very &quot;curious&quot; about this Prince guy!  I loved the way Sister would run right into Party Up, we would just break out.  Then the slight interruption, was &quot;Got a Broken Heart Again&quot; and it usually came just in time to chill you out with the guy you wanted to get with anyway!  Boy, does this one bring back memories.  Prince has come close once (Purple Rain) to this level of genius, but by far Dirty Mind was his absolute best!
B00000BKE0|4.0|OK, where do I start? &quot;Maiden's worst album&quot;, &quot;Low point of their career&quot;, &quot;Boring, predictable, weak Vocals&quot;. All these arguments are hitting on the wrong record. Why? Do Maiden have to sound like a progressive Rock Band? I cannot appreciate the return to their roots enough! Why is &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; a bad song? Because it doesn't sound like Genesis? Because it has no Synth Guitars? Because it's a plain rockin', straightforward song? Hell, it's actually one of my favorite Maiden songs! <br />It seems that most people where upset because Maiden didn't continiue the way they stopped at &quot;Seven Son&quot;. And thank god they didn't. &quot;Seventh Son&quot; was not only one of Maiden's weakest albums, it was also their most commercial and softened up record ever. Anyone else annoyed about the Top-30 refrain of &quot;Can I play with Madness&quot;?. Markted as a &quot;concept-album&quot; to gain more credibility, to proove that heavy metal musicans can have intellect too? Be serious, Seventh Son was far from the Maiden I know and love. <br />&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; is a great album, pure and simple. How can you NOT see the fact, that &quot;Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;Holy Smoke&quot;, &quot;Fates Warning&quot;, &quot;Run silent, run deep&quot;, &quot;No Prayer for the dying&quot; and &quot;Mother Russia&quot; are ten million times more Maiden than the overblown conceptual &quot;Seventh Son&quot; ever was. If you're looking for Genesis, don't buy this album! If you're looking for IRON MAIDEN, this album has all you need. I love it, I love Maiden for what they are.<br />Sure, their historical meaning and their line of legendary albums was ended with POWERSLAVE, no discussion about that. But let me make an awful comparision that will make all you &quot;True-Metallers&quot; want to kill me: Pearl Jam's first two albums saw them on top of the world, writing music histroy. Their last album was hated left and right, not because it was bad, because it didn't move as much as the first two did. Does that make BINAURAL an awful album? I think not! You can't reproduce the feeling a band like Maiden had in their prime time. And you can't help that matter by writing &quot;progressive-complex&quot; albums like &quot;Seventh Son&quot;. <br />&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; is Maiden as I know and love it, and I'm not ashamed to say. Anybody that loves Maiden for the reasons I do will love this album. All the others can stick with &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, Dream Theater, Spock's Beard or whatever else sounds &quot;Progressive&quot;. Maiden are Maiden and nothing else on this album. 4 Stars from me and always one of my favorite Maiden Records.
0062502182|4.0|This was a great story that was a quick read.  It left me with something to think about - a little chunk of life to chew on.  If you are a fan of things that will make you think a little without beeing too difficult, then this is your book.
0679746048|5.0|As i picked up this book and began to read I was drawn into the wold of 18 year old Susanna Kaysen. This is a stunning book, it will keep you on your feet wanting more, even when you've finished. I found it very insiteful, and I loved the way it kept changing scene, yet still giving a detailed idea of how her life was when in the hospital. I can assure you that most of you will love this book, and find your self drawn into the world of an 18 year old patient in the 1960's, and wondering what her life was like, and is like now. I would definatly recomend this book to anyone with an eye for a great read.
B0000508U6|2.0|This is the greatest CD you will ever hear, nor the worst. The fact is, it isn't that memorable. Yellow, the song you have heard on the radiostations for the past few weeks, is the hilight of the album, so don't expect much more. They sound like they're trying to be radiohead, but less original and therefore less effective. Don't waste your money.
068484267X|5.0|While reading this book you realise what life was like for Frank Mcourt as a child. He draws you in and lets you laugh and cry as he tells the story of his childhood. You literally get to see him grow up on the pages, with a new tale in each chapter.  You see how his mother had to cope, with no money for food and clothes, and how his father drinks the dole money.   Please, if you love a good book, then this tuely is, a wonderfull, and enchanting read.
6305558167|1.0|Based on reading the reviews, you either love this movie or you hate it. In my case, it was the latter.<br />The cliche-filled dialogue was shallow and pathetic. The characters were predictable in their blind devotion to the king. The special effects were horrible. All of this would not matter if the fundamental story were interesting, but even this lacked anything that could hold my interest for a long 2 hours. (Somehow my wife and I suffered through this to the end, only to be disappointed by a silly climax.)<br />I am tempted to give it 0 stars, if that were possible. Instead I will give it 1 star. Half a star for a couple interesting fight scenes (other fight scenes were unrealistic) and half a star for trying to be different.
B00004RFFI|5.0|I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it. Plus it is the only Natural Disaster film that I can stand! If you want a killer of a film that you wanna test on your sound system, this is the one! Storm chasing galore, and an internal story between the characters that allows you to make your own assumptions. It's refreshing, and covered in good, old, swirling dirt! Moo, baby!
0440219078|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Giver, the content was always moving along nicely, and was never dull. The writing was witty and had a nice touch of realism to it. The story wasn't to hard to understand but it was very bizzare: a young boy living in a controled community, the community controls everything, no colors, no lanscapes, no animal, no nothing, they don't have this stuff because those type of thoughts could mess up the peacefulness of the community. This boy has ben given the task to have the memories of the outside world. He will get these memories by a man that already has the memories who transfers the memories to him. The only problem I have with this book, is that it rushes into everything too quickly, and seems to not talk to detailful about what is going on. All in all though, it is a great book.
6305011575|5.0|&quot;It&quot; for one thing is hard to locate on AMAZON!!! Now, with that out of the way, here is the review: In the town of Derry there is an ancient force that knows exactly how to appeal to children...In the form of a clown. Pennywise to be exact. Played perfectly by Tim Curry. The film, like the book, follows a group a kids that are being &quot;scarrified&quot; by this menace clown. Pennywise feast's on their fear, that being his food. From start to near finish this kicker is half mystery - half suspence - and believe it or not, another half horror. How does it pull it off? After several viewings I have to say...It is 150% great. (But why a dumb spider!!!!!!!!)
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink is such a new refreshing artist.  The first time I saw her video, &quot;You make me sick&quot; I think I fell in love with this lady.  Also the CD has many other great tracks such as, Most Girls, and love is such a crazy thing, just to name a few.  Buy this cd and take it home today, I guarantee Pink will not make you feel sick.
0451160916|5.0|Ok, I will admit it, I am the most jumpy, scaredy cat in the world!  I have never read a horror/ghost novel because frankly I get scared while watching reruns of Scooby Doo.  Yes, laugh all you want, but I know there are others out there who feel exactly the same way.  Now, knowing how much of a chicken I am, I suppose I can get in to my review of Steven King's The Shining.  For the record I had to read this book for a class and I would have never read it otherwise, but I actually began reading it and couldn't put it down.  King has created a spellbinding story of a family and a hotel.  The Torrence family, as dysfunctional as they may seem, became my tie to the novel.  I felt like I was in that hotel with them, like I was one of Jack and Wendy's children.  Their son, Danny, was however the creepy one to me.  I have always been afraid of books, movies, even cartoons, where there is a child who seems to be &quot;different&quot;.  Danny definitely fits the mold of the creepy little kid.  He has a power, &quot;The Shine&quot;, that allows him to read people's minds, predict the future, send messages to other people, even make things happen just by thinking about them. Also, Danny can see ghost. Yes, GHOSTS! He has a &quot;friend&quot; Tony who is a ghost. He shows Danny signs and other visual representations of either good or evil that is to come.  The sign that troubles Danny the most is &quot;Redrum&quot;  So he learns to read so he can decipher what it means.The novel pits the family against their new home, a huge hotel that has a history  that is almost as unbelievable as the ghosts that haunt it.  The &quot;Overlook&quot; is a hotel where Jack Torrence and his wife and son will be living for the winter.  High atop a mountain in the Rocky Mountains the Overlook becomes very inaccessible during the winter months. Jack's job is to maintain the hotel during the &quot;off-season&quot; time.  Throughout their stay there, the history of the Overlook begins to be chippedaway by Jack, who is a writer and uncovers a secret scrapbook in the basement.    This novel layers information upon information to leave the reader feeling submersed in the terror of the lives of the Torrences.  First we are faced with the drinking problem Jack has, along with the child abuse, and the loss of his job due to his beating of a high school student. You also must remember the jagged history of the Overlook, with the multiple murders and high profile owners/visitors it has housed throughout the years.  It could also be called the &quot;hotel of many secrets&quot;.  Jack and his family are the ones who must uncover this past and in the process must face their pasts also. There are many thematic choices in this novel that I find very evocative and intriguing.  I am very impressed by Kings ability to transcend the conventions of the genre and make a riveting storyline that you will be immersed in.  This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first page until you finish all 464 pages of horror. From the scary landscape of the Overlook, to the flashbacks of the past, to the ghoulish woman in room 217, you will be scared no matter how many horror novels you have read.  If you want to be truly scared, read &quot;The Shining.&quot; Though frightening it is a fabulous book.
B00003CXSP|4.0|A stellar cast and a great director should have made this film one of the most renound sequals to ever grace the big screen. Unfortunatly, the audiance it was shown to has appearently dumbed down, or expected something that no one could give. That unique 'cat-and-mouse' game with Starling and Lecter was what chilled and excited fans to begin with. The novel Hannibal gave critics and fans indigestion, but they were the ones who pressed for a sequal to begin with. &quot;More, more, more!&quot; What did we expect? Lecter said he wouldn't kill Clarice, and that was just odd. &quot;The worlds far more interesting with you in it.&quot; Hannibal Lecter. Murderer. Psychopath. Cannibal. He spared her. Why? True Lecter and Starling fans would argue that he loved her. In his own sick way, he did. And they changed the ending for you, aren't you happy yet, you oh doubting critic? I thought the plot was dumbed down for you. The movie is spectacular, the scenens, pacing, and the characters (hey, I liked Julianne Moore in this) but, I think, people were really edgy about Moore replacing Foster. Big Flippin' deal! She did a good job; her accent was good, and the Starling fans who didn't like Lecter said that she was 'true to character.' I don't understand that. Thomas Harris wrote the characters. Whatever he plans to do with them, they are still the same characters. Eight years passed, Starling is of course going to change. I think the two groups of people wanted exactly two different things, so it's impossible to do a fair job of doing both. Scenario #1: Lecter and Starling ride off into the sunset, lovey dovey and happy, somewhat like Harris wrote it to begin with. (My personal choice) Scenario #2: Clarice captures Hannibal, and he goes back to prision. Scenario #3: (What actually happened) Clarice doesn't succumb to Hannibal's desire for her, and instead, tries to catch him. He ends up chopping off his own hand to spare her, and, of course that kiss by the fridge.  All about control. Ever aspect of this movie, and it's dilemmas, are about controll. In the words of Thomis Harris, &quot;who had dumbed down? Clarice Starling, or her critics?&quot; Bravo. I agree. 4 stars out of 5.
B000002VMH|5.0|Annie Lennox, in my opinion is one of the greatest female singers alive today, with vocal ability and beauty that can make other artists feel sheepish in the prescence of this fantastic woman. Although Annie is fighting to keep the independent side of her alive most people always classify her under her former group Eurythmics, which in my opinion was Annie's immateur phase. On this album she produces songs on this album ranging from a variety of styles that will satisfy anybody's appetite. Among my favorites is &quot;Why,&quot; a beautiful ballad about a relationship that took a turn for the worse, &quot;Walking On Broken Glass&quot; sounds more like a pop song with the same concept in mind as &quot;Why&quot; except that Annie demands attention from her lover, &quot;Money Can't Buy It&quot; sounds like a song Blondie would sing, she even raps at the end! &quot;Little Bird&quot; Annie's voice really shines through on this track, with an incredible beat and of course, Annie's vocals as the chorus, and &quot;The Gift&quot; about the miracle of breaking up, it's very sad yet moving song.<br />For a debut album this certainly tops the list, and after you buy this album you will understand my point of view.
B00004XONN|1.0|Listen to it 1000 times. Makes no difference. Garbage is garbage, no matter how the mind attempts to convince you that you're not the idiot you are for time and money wasted on this junk. Radiohead has played a joke on its fans and is laughing at all the acclaim heaped on it by fans. This ain't the cosmic leap from Help to Rubber Soul or Revolver to Sgt Pepper. This is the same noise that George Harrison released 34 years ago on Wonderwall music. There were a few deluded Beatles fans who were convinced that it was quite genius back then, too. Heck, let's face it, as wild futuristic avant garde musicians, Kid A doesn't even compare to Yoko Ono's stuff. Sad thing is if Yoko put out an album of mechanical warblings and slapped the Radiohead name on it, the same people here who love this album would love that one even more.
B000059PPX|3.0|It was '68: I was 18: this movie was stunning and bright. It's 2001: I'm 49: this movie is embarrassingly naive. Some things are best left in the imagination I think. I would have been happier with my memories of the times and the thrill this movie brought than the reality of how laughable it is. God, it makes you feel old...
0451169514|5.0|I first read 'IT' when I was in my last year of primary school, whilst I enjoyed the book a lot, I don't think I got as much out of it as I could have done, due to a general lack of understanding. However, recently I read it again and only stopped reading for food breaks. One of the many reasons why I like this book and others King has written is because of the way King really unravels the personalities and lives of the characters, without straying too far away from the plot. In my personal opinion, this is the best of King's yet, besides perhaps, 'The Stand'. If I had any advice it would be; don't watch the film, it will ruin the way you think about the characters.
B00004YKUY|4.0|1980. King Biscuit Flower Hour and Journey is belting out &quot;Loving, Touching, Squeezing&quot;. <br />This was my first taste to what was to become one of my favorite rock bands of all time. <br />I must admit I was a bit skeptical, even disappointed when I heard that journey was releasing a new CD with a new frontman. What would they sound like without Steve Perry's voice haunting the room. <br />From the days of rocker Greg Rollie to Steve Perry, I always looked forward to something new but I never expected the surprise I got when I listened to Arrival. Steve Augeri's vocals are amazing. He gives Journey a fresh new sound and yet can sing with an almost haunting stature like Steve Perry. <br />For those long time fans of Journey, &quot;Lifetime of Dreams&quot; will be appreciated and of course they power ballads that they have so greatly achieved still come on strong throughout the CD. <br />Journey has arrived to a new world, in a new time, and hopefully are here to remain for sometime yet to come. <br />Keep looking at that Wheel in the Sky guys. Neal, Ross, Jonathan,  welcome back and Steve and Deen, welcome aboard the mother ship. Keep rocking guys.....
B000059TPN|5.0|This is one of my favorite action films, one reason is because it has a lot of humor in it, mostly coming off of Connery and Cage's (odd-couple like) relationship.  The DVD is in outstanding quality, has DTS and DD 5.1, and a great anamorphic transfer of the film and it's a Criterion disc!!  The soundtrack will virtually blow your speakers away!!! Great action, good humor, a great DVD.
B000056PWV|5.0|A daredevil confined to a wheelchair is the concept of Alfred Hitchcock's comedy-mystery &quot;Rear Window&quot;, a man of action so bored with his confinement that he begins spying on the neighbors he can see across his Greenwich Village courtyard: the frustrated composer,the &quot;interpretative dancer&quot;, the newlyweds, the desperately lonely spinster ... and the bickering couple. The wife suddenly disappears. Has she been murdered? L.B. Jeffries thinks so, and he convinces his fiance Lisa (Grace Kelly) and the insurance company nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) who visits him every day. (Jeffries, a professional photographer, has been temporarily disabled in an accident.) This set-up is perfect for Hitchcock, who loved tense situations in close quarters (&quot;Life Boat&quot;, &quot;Rope&quot;), and who was in top form when he directed this masterpiece of entertainment in 1954. (There was a made-for-TV remake a few years back; according to... reviewers, it's pretty awful.) James Stewart was one of Hollywood's most popular personalities, but he was often mis-cast. He was pushing fifty when he played the 25-year old Lindbergh in&quot;The Spirit of St Louis&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Rear Window&quot; he's too mature for the lead. The part just weeps for William Holden. Stewart even takes his shirt off in a couple of scenes, revealing a pale, thin physique. The idea that Grace Kelly would travel all the way down from the East Sixties to Greenwich Village to spend the evening with him is a little ... well,unbelievable. Miss Kelly is almost as seductive here as she was in her next Hitchcock &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;.The Master was obviously infatuated -- but, then, who wasn't? She also had a droll sense of humor: the way she pronounces &quot;weird&quot; is priceless. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey give witty support. Raymond Burr, just a couple of years away from playing the most famous of fictional lawyers, is quite creepy as the killer Thorwald. The sound trackis a mixed marvel of car traffic, distant voices, and snatches of music; it sounds great with stereophonic ear phones. About the only real complaint in John Michael Hayes' screenplay that the pragmatic might bring up: Doesn't Jeffries ever LOCK his door?
1559408898|3.0|I love the film, ever since I was 11 years old I have loved it!  I assumed that the Criterion edition would have it all.  But really all it has is a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; of the film, the transfer and the sound isn't that great.  First off, the soundtrack is in 2.0, not 5.1 and the transfer of the video is kinda shabby and I don't think it's anamorphic either. But, the other DVD version of the film is the same except that it isn't the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, so for now the Criterion is the best you can get, it just isn't that great!
6305078564|5.0|This movie is great.  It's true to the time, and there's no sex or yucky stuff, if you know what I mean. Sometimes in these movies, they make the movie more modern, and it makes it unrealistic.  The production of this film was very accurate and hardly missed anything in the book.  The dialect is taken directly from the book.  <br />Right away, I fell in love with Colin Firth.  He's handsome, and plays the part of Mr. Darcy exactly the way I would expect him to.  <br />Over the weekend, sometimes I like to splurge, and I watch all 6 episodes.  It takes alllll day to do, but I love it.  I would recommend watching one episode each night, that way it won't be too much at a time.<br />Over all, this mini series was GREAT!  A&amp;E are great producers!
B000055Y0Y|5.0|First off this film has Clint Eastwood in one of his best roles he's ever played.  You can read the summary if you want to know what the film is about so I'm not going to bore you with another summary, this is a review. But it has great suspense, Malkovich plays a great, sinister villain out to get the President and puts Eastwood right in the middle which is his plan.  Great soundtrack (5.1) and an impressive anamorphic transfer, and also some pretty good special features as well. Worth buying.
0783225970|3.0|I won't speak to the quality of the film:  Many others here have done so, and the debate will rage whether it's a modern masterpiece or overblown tripe.<br />Suffice to say that it *is* a significant film, and that the extras on this DVD are quite nice (outtakes, interviews).<br />However -- and this is a BIG however -- the quality of this transfer to DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  It really looks like they simply took the old composite master for the LD release and used it for the DVD.  The colors bleed into one another, and solid color areas are often murky and noisy.  This can be verified on any well-calibrated NTSC monitor, using a quality DVD player connected via component cables.
B000002LK1|5.0|The album Violator is, by far, the best Depeche Mode album to date. I would have to say that they attained perfection when they made this album. Even if you are thinking \\"I already have all those songs on other albums,\\" buy it anyway! The rare song \\"Halo\\" is a gem and you cannot find it anywhere else but here. It is a major shame more attention is not drawn to it. The other songs, \\"Sweetest Perfection,\\" \\"Waiting for the Night,\\" \\"Blue Dress,\\" and \\"Clean\\" are all superb as well. Plus, you get the original version of DM's best song of all time, \\"Enjoy the Silence.\\" This CD is a magnificent buy. It's like you are buying nine golden eggs for the price of one (album). Buy this. You cannot go wrong with Violator! It's the &quot;Sweetest Perfection.&quot;
B0000508U6|5.0|If your looking for a fun, partytime CD, go somewhere else.  But if you want a calming, beautiful set of songs that sooth and relax, you've got the right idea.  I had heard from people that this was an excellent CD, though they warned me it was more mellow than you might expect  from the sound of their released &quot;Yellow&quot;.  Ready to try something new (as lately I'd bombarded my ears with the harsher (to say the least) Rage Against the Machine), I got Coldplay.  I really do enjoy this CD, though my friends say it's no surprise commenting that I have a thing for &quot;pale, scrawny Brit Bands&quot;.  Oh well, I like  them and love this CD all the same.
6302799066|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced.  I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.<br />Part of the inspiration for Kubrick's satirical masterpiece came from the publication in the fifties and early sixties of such absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's \\"On Thermonuclear War\\" in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate.  Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake.  Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was realized some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a \\"nuclear winter\\" that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S.  Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago.  Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.<br />Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented as a comedic thriller.  As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) ...<br />One of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that it almost happened.  During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare.  Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction)./>One of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that it almost happened.

B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink put some heart and soul to this record along with some attitude and you can feel it from all the songs. At first I heard Most Girls and said it might be a worth buying, and then You Make Me Sick came out and bought it for Christmas. Now I must say that this is a hot record. I didn't expect this record to be so tight. I let some of my friends convince me she didn't have it and was just trying to act black. People was I wrong. If I could choose the top 10 R &amp; B CD's of 2K I would put this in there for sure. Even though I think Pink needs to find herself a good man because she seems to hate them, I will say to you to run out and buy this for your listening pleasure.
B00000IFWE|2.0|I love Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, but what brings this CD down is not necessarily the material (which indeed is below normal TP standards), but the way it is performed.  The band gives the flattest performance ever on a Heartbreakers record, and it sounds like they are just going through the motions.  Tom voice sounds like he's just about burned out, or perhaps tired from putting out such an awesome string of albums since the late 70's.  There's just no fire or spark behind these songs at all, and its a shame to hear such a bad album from these guys.  I find it hard to believe that he doesnt still have a good album or two left, but sadly that may just be the case.   A couple good tracks save it from 1 star, but that's all its good for, unfortunately.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it immensely, finding it to be a sweet, light hearted comedy, as much a tribute to Trek fandom as a satirical version of it.  I just watched the DVD last night and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly- it was even funnir than I remembered it being.  Is it funnier if you know Star Trek?  Sure, but so much of the humor is derived from the fish-out-of-water set-up that you will be laughing even if you have never heard of William Shatner or seen anyone ever give a Vulcan greeting.  Don't deny yourself the joy of seeing this film beause of some dislike for (Tim Allen, Star Trek, Sci-Fi, Silly Comedies).  Watch especially for Tony Shaloub, whose constant laxidasical understatement made me laugh every time he opened his mouth to speak a line.  Tony is the true gem of this movie.
B00003CXP1|5.0|That right there is proof that this masterpiece goes beyond the realm of conventionalism. Pi was disturbing enough but this takes the cake. There isn't a positive &quot;eighth-note throughout this tune!&quot; Drugs, prescription or illegal, and the ignorance of self-inflicted deathwish and utopic pipedreams governs this mental mind-f**k from start to finish. Definitely, a keeper. Avant-garde at its best but still stands alone within the avalanche of Hollywood-made drug movies that infiltrate today's theaters. Excellent work from veteran actress Burstyn and Connelly who's addiction that's her to a new level. Not for your ignorant and/or conventional movie fan. My highest recommendation!
B000002513|5.0|The heart of Rock N Roll can be boiled down to a few chords, a catchy riff, and the right attitude. But if you want the heart AND the soul, the mind, body, and the spirit, and all of its possibilities, THE WILD, THE INNOCENT &amp; THE E STREET SHUFFLE is where you'll find it. It rebels against every preconceived notion of what Rock's limitations are supposed to be. Of structure and style and scope. It's Bruce's musical journey from the hangouts of his hometown in Jersey, as a guy with a dream, to the possibilities of what might be just over the river in New York City. Although no song addresses this head on, its implicit in the overall concept, that this story-song album is ultimately Springsteen's autobiography. &quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot; is the opener. As the band warms up, then starts to play, you know this is party time. It's Rock N Roll in the summer.  No air-conditioning's allowed. All the windows are opened wide to meld with the sounds and the sights and the sweat of the streets. To mix with the heat and the humidity. To rub elbows with the proud and the profane, the winners and losers, the lovers and loners. It's the preview of coming attractions, and the album delivers on what this song promises.   &quot;Kitty's Back&quot;, the third song in, opens with a short blistering guitar in heat that gives way to a lazy summer afternoon lament  about  how dull life is now that the most lascivious creature the boys have ever known is gone from the neighborhood, and what she did to get out. As the mood shifts from shuffle to swing and back again, the song is sneakily building momentum,until hazily, the boys spot her walking towards them from the other end of the alley. &quot;Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes, here she comes,&quot; they hungrily whisper, at which point the whole song explodes into a musical, if not literal, gang-bang.  &quot;Sandy&quot; is a different creature entirely. She's your first true love.  Your lover AND friend. She's the girl you showed your tender side to. She's the one who gave you courage to do so. She's the girl you shared life and dreams with. She's also the girl you probably left behind. Bruce uses an accordian here unashamedly. By this point in the album, you've already expected to expect the unexpected, still &quot;Wild Billy's Circus Story&quot; comes from out of left field, musically speaking. A tuba in a rock n roll record? Yup. This is the color Bruce needed to tell this amusing tale of a boy who ran away to join the circus, the way Bruce leaves his hometown by joining the rock n roll circus. It's a truly offbeat number, but Bruce's wry delivery has a way of making you appreciate this song before you're ready to. This song serves as the bridge to Side Two's N.Y.C. suite. And how sweet it is. &quot;West Side Story&quot; was a big influence on Bruce, as it was on all of us back then, and he uses part of that film's landscape to paint his own story about young love in the city between Spanish Johnny &amp; Puerto Rican Jane in &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot;. Filled with stunning imagery (&quot;Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat/ Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on/ And her sister prays for lost souls/ then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone) &quot;...57th Street&quot; is simultaneously tough and tender and enormously cinematic. &quot;Rosalita&quot; of course is the barn burner. Every yearning in a young guy's soul, every dream come true or not,every 4th of July fireworks display, every gamble of going for broke is encapsulated in this 7 minute rock n roll extravaganza. Any other album would have closed here. This is the money shot. But the best, if that's possible, is what follows: &quot;N.Y.C. Serenade&quot;, the album's 11 minute closer, is an amazing  achievement. So tight, yet so loose it feels like an improvisation in it's midnight till dawn setting, I can think of no other song as a touchstone for this number. David Sancious' audacious piano intro: part classical,part jazz, part blues, hands off to Bruce's heartfelt acoustic guitar-talk in what has to be one of music's most unforgettable moments, before quietly settling in for this final story of our boy as one of the  inhabitants of the cruel city, and a stark contrast to the block party atmosphere of the album's opener, but ending on a determinately optimistic note.  Never again would Bruce and the band show such versatility or be this musically adventurous. As time went on, Bruce seemed to straight-jacket himself into tighter and tighter song structures, until he began, literally, writing two chord songs. I guess I shouldn't be angry that he never wrote down this way again. I guess I should be grateful that, at one time, he did.
B000059HCI|5.0|I was tempted to title my summary &quot;Drugs are bad, mm'kay?&quot; because this movie was so sad I was desperate to inject a little humor. Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about this movie and learned about it, the more fascinating it seemed. I also am one of those people who, when they hear a movie is extremely shocking and disturbing, get a burning urge to see it as fast as I can to see if it shocks me (especially if it's unrated or NC-17), since I am pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.<br />  The plot concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business.  Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. REAL ugly. A couple shots even kind of give a whole new definition of the word 'ugly'. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress so she can appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out by being addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to go to a doctor who gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to actually be the old-fashioned kind they gave to women in the 50s- speed.<br />I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes pills and starts losing weight, as well as suddenly becoming very energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through the film (one of the few that had a tiny bit of comic relief) Harry visits her --the only visit he makes during the movie where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope money. He is briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and tells her he bought her a big screen TV-he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that &quot;TV is her fix&quot;. He looks like he's getting a bad feeling when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, and then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out. This is the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An aggressive fridge with a mind of its own sounds Monty Python-esque when you first hear about it, but trust me, you won't be laughing by the end of the movie.<br />  One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The scenes where Sarah hallucinates are pretty close to the real thing. The description I probably agree with most came from Darren Aronofsky himself-he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all 4 characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were.<br />  My only complaints would be that I wish it were longer, with more time for character development. I would have liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before they were addicts, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is great- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here...wow. I would have liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he is excellent and also almost unrecognizable  (he said he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and boy does it show). Connelly I disliked so much before that I would actively avoid seeing movies she was in, but I was very impressed and convinced that she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but she was dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell, which many actresses over 50 would probably not be brave enough to do.<br />  Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay far away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board.  And we were all people who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported and glorified that whole hideous 'heroin chic' trend. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast. And even though I keep my weight down the old-fashioned way, I'll probably never look at my fridge quite the same way again...they were addicts, as well as their relationships with each other.

B000001EKX|5.0|After the dissapointing sales of their debut album,Kiss(with producers Kerner and Wise)decided to take the heavier approach on the follow up.The recording sessions in LA didn't pass without incident,but it didn't show on the finished product,HOTTER THAN HELL.Although derided at the time for it's murky production and Led Zepplin attitude,it is now regarded by hard rock critics as an underrated gem.Sure,less songs were used in concert from this album than from KISS,but it's heavier edge places the band well  on the road to the classic Kiss sound.<br />1)GOT TO CHOOSE - Paul Stanley warns his girl that the time has come to stop fooling around.I could be wrong,but methinks I hear an acoustic guitar buried in the mix.Great group harmonies on the chorus.It surprises me that no one has picked up on how well the boys could sing harmnies.The guitar solo from Ace Frehley is concise and individualistic.<br />2)PARASITE - Sung by Gene Simmons,written by Ace.There's a clinging lover who must be dropped or there'll be trouble.Cool opening riff and fretwork by the man from the planet Jendel,who used this song in the early concerts to lead into his solo showcase.<br />3)GOIN' BLIND - Power ballad by Gene with a tongue-in-cheek edge; about a love affair between an old(er)man and a young(er)woman. Carries on the wicked sense of humor Gene first displayed on KISS' NOTHIN' TO LOOSE.The original title of this song was LITTLE LADY.<br />4)HOTTER THAN HELL - Paul gives us a tale with a warning:always look for a wedding band if you have a one night stand!Peter Criss goes gonzo on the backbeat and I love that gong he strikes at the climax to the song.Ace's guitar dances around Petert's skinwork.<br />5)LET ME GO,ROCK'N'ROLL - A good excuse for a group jam.Very few of Kiss rivals' could compete with them when they were firing on all cylinders.<br />6)ALL THE WAY - Gene complains that his latest beau has become a pain in the neck(to put it mildly!).He lets his demon persona loose on the vocals to this slight,but quirky track.Rumbling bass,piercing guitar and dropping drumbeats mix with great Gene/Paul vocals on the chorus.<br />7)WATCHIN' YOU - Left off the first album and already a concert staple.This is Kiss at their best:very heavy and never humble!The Demon and his girl are in a room with people who like to watch ('nuff said!).This track is more heavy metal than hard rock.<br />8)MAINLINE - If love is the drug,then the Catman's addicted!Great vocals from Peter.I wish this could have been attempted live.<br />9)COMIN'HOME - Paul is getting sick of touring and wants to get back to his baby.Great use of acoustic guitar.This track (plus GOIN'BLIND and GOT TO CHOOSE)was resurrected from the historic KISS UNPLUGGED event.<br />10)STRANGE WAYS - Written by Ace,sung by Peter.The Catman is stuck in the middle of a love affair that's both weird and cool. Peter is in screaming mode for this one.Contains spaced out fretwork by Ace,including a solo that would send a first time guitar novice interstellar.
B00004U8PA|5.0|Before I ever saw RHPS I heard the song Time Warp.I loved the song so much that,a few years later,I finally rented the movie.The first time I saw it,I laughed for SO long!The songs are  extremely catchy.The first time I saw Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-n-furter,I couldn't BELIEVE it!And,when the cast sang Time Warp,that was REALLY funny.It's been nearly a week since I watched it,and the song &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot; is STILL stuck in my head.Let me just say that this movie is not for everyone.For those of you who like movies that are hilarious,this one's for you.This is now my favorite movie.So,come up to the lab,and see what's on the slab.
B000056NX5|1.0|They've butchered JCS.  Buy the 1970 version if you want to see something very good.
B00005J6UP|5.0|What can i say, this was the best film ever on VHS and now it has been brought to DVD, how could it be improved anymore. However DVD has done it again the sounds are crisper, the one liners are better and the Truffle Shuffle is the best it has ever been. I recommend this DVD to anyone even if you have it on VHS be sure to but it, as it is the pefect addition to any eighties freak colletion.
0380804557|5.0|As much as I liked Gaiman's books Neverwhere and Smoke &amp; Mirror, Stardust is the Gaiman book that truly enchanted me. Stardust builds the plot and develops the characters with a leisurely charm and with use of remarkably few words. I never saw where he was going with the plot and I was saddened when the book concluded -- I wanted more. As soon as I finished this book, I gave my copy to a friend and sent copies as gifts. It is a terrific read!
B000059RL3|5.0|To whom it may concern today April 19th,2001 I want to Thank the power that may be for releasing this Deluxe Edition of Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot; 1971 album for the world to hear today 2001. I'm listening to this album right now as I writing this letter to whom it may concern today 2001. I remember when this album came out back in 1971. I was 9 years old that the time,I had to have a tonsil operation the week the &quot;What's Going On&quot; was released. I will say that this album continues to be one of my personal favorite albums to listen to at any given time. I really enjoy listening the disc#2 the live recording of &quot;What's Going On&quot; recorded &quot;Live&quot; on Marvin Gaye,Day in Washington,D.C. The day of May 1st 1972 Marvin Gaye's, home place of birth and growing as a child to a young adult. I've read three books about Marvin Gaye, the lastest book titled &quot;Trouble Man&quot;,then next second book titled &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; and then the first book I bought in 1985 titled &quot;Divided Soul&quot; I'm pleased to know that people haven't forgeten Marvin Gaye, the man,the music and song. I still a long time fan of Marvin Gaye,I remembered when Marvin Gaye, was killed by his father Marvin Gaye senior, on April 1st 1984 one day before Marvin Gaye's 45th birthday. I was a Job Corps student at the time period I was 22years old. I'm originally from Flushing Queens,New York. I now live in San Diego,California today 2001 since August of 2000. Before San Diego, I lived in Los Angeles County (Santa Monica,Venice,Long Beach,and West Hollywood) I've been living in the state of California since September 18th 1994. I hope that other people will get a chance to hear this Deluxe Edition of this &quot;What's Going On&quot; album on Compact Disc Today 2001. I'm glad to hear Marvin Gaye,talking during this historic event in 1972 on May 1st Proclaimed Marvin Gaye,Day in Washington,D.C. Lastly I'm glad again that Marvin Gaye,hadhis parents and family with Marvin,during this special day of celebration on May 1st 1972. I will always treasure this 30th Deluxe Edition for &quot;What's Going On&quot; Album for as long as I live and try to pass this album to other people that I continue to meet in my lifetime. I never knew that this &quot;What's Going On&quot; album was ever recorded &quot;Live&quot; it was back then. This album shows the world that Marvin Gaye,never lost his ability to perform a &quot;Live&quot; show after a absent of 4 years as I learned hearing from Marvin Gaye, state during this &quot;Live&quot; performance in his honor on May 1st 1972. I'm still listening to the second compact disc#2 That's all for now until next time &quot;Love,Peace&amp;Happiness&quot; Take Care and God's Speed Yours Truly Kevin Small,A loyal fan of Marvin Gaye.
0345350499|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago and I loved it.  I felt every emotion that the characters went through.  It seems really long when you first pick it up, but once I started reading it I didn't want it to ever end!
0783226063|3.0|This is NOT a faithful reproduction of Dune the novel. As with all blockbuster books, a film interpretation that is literal to the plot is almost impossible. Editing the plot down to a manageable 2 or 3 hours means plenty of &#34;expository lumps&#34; as Ursula Le Guin calls them. These are the over-voice narrations or worse, scrolling text, to let a viewer figure out what the script writer left out of the film.<br /><br />Having said all that, Lynch's film is not a bad one. The choice of ornatic, Victorian gothic costuming gives the flavor of future feudal-Imperial Caladan and Arrakis, a universe with dukes, barons and Emperors. Jurgen Prochnow (of Das Boot fame), Francesca Annis, Kyle MacLachlan, Patrick Stewart and Sian Philips are a magnificent, capable cast.<br /><br />The over-the-top Baron and Feyd (played by Sting) are evocative of the obsessive, perverse duo in the book if not faithful to the actual portrayal. The heart-plugs, sewn into the Baron's slave flunkies, is a chilling visual interpretation of the Baron's sadistic pleasures.<br /><br />My only quarrel is really with the screenplay adaptation. The voice-activated weapon (a merging of Voice, the commanding use of voice by Bene Gesserit and the duke's superb training.) It seems a feeble idea to me. The Bene Gesserit are really not well explained. However, the director's cut version is a reasonably good film in itself and worth watching.
0783240287|5.0|This by far the best DVD musical we have bought.  My 9, 4, and 1 year kids all love it and can't get enough of it.  The scene with Mr and Mrs Potipher is a little too intense for my younger children, but that's the wonderful thing about DVDs they know how to press the skip button as soon as they see them!  I think the whole production, especially the bright colors and the mix of the young students with the cast makes it more appealing to kids.
B000002C2E|5.0|Comparisons of this album to his vast catalog are hard to make.  Over the years, though, his best albums have been born of crisis or sadness in his personal life.  &quot;Time out of mind&quot; has been compared to &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; for example and they both have a basis in misery.  But on a scale of hopelessness, &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; is a order of magnitude darker and more forelorn.  You get the feeling from listening that there isn't a glimmer of joy in this man's life.  I didn't absolutely love this album upon first listening but it is complex and you really have to spend time with it to see it as one of his masterpieces.  A lot has been said about the old-timey feel of the songs and it's true there are various borrowings from the past.  But end result is quite different from anything else and it defies categorization.  Some of the interviews he gave around the release of the album indicate he put himself in the standpoint of the various songs and he's not necessarily as disturbed as you might think from the lyrics and mood of the songs.  Let's hope not.
B000002UAX|5.0|I'm not sure what I can add to what's already been said, but I guess I can get in my 10 cents worth. First, I would agree that if one pared down the record to one CD of about 20 songs it would be even more stunning. That being said, I actually do like some of the weaker numbers. For instance, &quot;Why Don't We Do It In the Road?&quot; may be a pretty weak song, but Paul's vocal on it may be his best on the album (well, other than &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;). At the same time I could probably do without &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, which sounds just a little to WINGSISH for my liking. Still, Paul does weigh in with &quot;I Will&quot; (which I consider one of his better ballads), &quot;Back in the USSR&quot;, &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; which is probably one of the most demented hard-rock songs ever recorded.<br />John's stuff is almost all great. &quot;Julia&quot; is haunting, &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; is a gem, &quot;....Me and My Monkey&quot; rocks. Even some of the lesser stuff like &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; (buried on side 4 of the LP) has its charms. Sadly &quot;Revolution 9&quot; seemed really great when I was 13, but is pretty annoying now. By the way, I think having Ringo of all people croon on &quot;Good-night&quot; was a stroke of genius. Let's see, of course &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;I'm So Tired&quot;, &quot;Yer Blues&quot;, &quot;Revolution 1&quot;, and &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; (which is supposedly about how the Maharishi let everyone down by making a pass at Mia Farrow) are all classics.<br />George, for his part weighs in with 4 songs of varying quality. The better songs are &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (which may be the best song on the record) and &quot;Long, Long, Long.&quot; &quot;Piggies&quot; is actually kind of silly, but how often do you hear harpsichords on rock records. &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; is kind of a throwaway, but at the same time ispretty catchy.<br />So, over-all the WHITE ALBUM is a strange mix of must-haves and toss-offs. And in many ways the toss-offs are what make it what it is.<br />Well, there you have it. Pretty simple really.
0716703440|5.0|Of the two shelves of physics books I own, this book is easily the one I cherish the most.  I wish I had books on other physics subjects that explained things as clearly as this book does.<br />This book is huge, in large part because it takes the time to explain each topic very thoroughly.  The authors take difficult topics, and break them down into as simple terms as possible.  Although quite advanced topics are covered, very little is expected of a reader as a prerequisite, beyond sophomore level math and a brief exposure to special relativity.  These things combine to make the book great for self-study, when it isn't possible to ask a professor for clarification of something glossed over in a text.<br />This book does a great job of explaining concepts visually, instead of only in algebraic terms.  I, for one, can understand and remember concepts much better if I can picture them, instead of having to just memorize equations.
0590259385|5.0|I was first introduced to this book as part of a college course on literature for children, and instantly fell in love.  Rythmic verses of this rhyming text with fill-in-the-blank style pauses at the end of each stanza help early readers learn to read, young children squeal with glee, and everybody within ear shot get the urge to get up and dance!  In fact, a reading of this book has been produced on tape, with a wonderful latino-mambo background beat; it's also available in oversized format for reading in a group.
B000009ED0|3.0|Firstly, a confession, yes I did buy this album because I'd heard &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; about 1000 times - yes that was pretty much the only reason why I bought it. Now onwards with the review.<br />On the surface of it, this album should be one of the better rap-metal cash cows of the late 90s - all the ingredients are here; Kid Rock (contrary to popular belief, a rapper from the 80s) with his justified anger, Twisted Brown Trucker - a band perfectly capable of keeping pace and volume with the louder metal groups of the era, and some very loud (possibly overplayed) riffs. The only problem is that Rock and friends seem more than content to rest on these credententials rather than using them as the basis of their music.<br />Kid Rock's delivery is generally superb, however one of the attractions of rap-metal is having the rapper actually rap - on many tracks, Rock just shouts his lyrics. Another problem is the fact that Rock consistently raps in an old school style - not a problem for most tracks but when taken over the length of the entire album the predictability of rhythm, cadence and subject matter (sample couplet: &quot;I don't like small cars or real big women/but somehow I always find myself in 'em&quot; - sentiments continued throughout the album) do wind up grating somewhat.<br />Twisted Brown Trucker seem to be suffering from a split personality problem on many of the tracks. It might be simply due to Rock's desire to cover so many musical bases (old school party rap to funk to metal to country and everything in between) but quite often the backing music is not as dynamic as perhaps it could be - even going some way to sounding derivative.<br />The memorable riffs might have gone some way to making the album the sales success it was (and still is) but there's really only so much you can do with them. Even the riffs on &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; get annoying after a while - even worse are the tracks which seem to have been built around a riff, they get to the &quot;skip this track&quot; stage far too quickly.<br />The last culprit here is Joe C. I fail to see what logic there is in putting him onto the tracks at all. The effect might be to beef up Rock's work on the title track but this doesn't work. What the actual effect of Joe's performance is can be summed up like this: &quot;What on earth is a rapper even more profane than Rock doing on this track?&quot;. The other problem is that he sounds like he's about 5 years old - no matter how many fan sites say that he's 27 and a midget it isn't going to sway my view that Joe C should be at home in front of the Playstation.<br />That said, there are some tracks where everything seems to have come together (most of &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, &quot;Welcome 2 Tha Party&quot; and &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; being the most obvious examples). These moments of brilliance hopefully point to a more cohesive album the next time these guys get together and record some new material - not &quot;History Of Rock&quot;, I mean a proper release - hopefully sooner rather than later.
0440219078|4.0|In my opinion, the Giver, by Lois Lowry, can be compared to such great works of literature as 1984, or Fahreinhheit 451.  I feel that it is a classic of the genre, or someday will be.  It is a remarkable book, and it deserves much praise.
B000001Y42|4.0|Three Dollar Bill is still Limp Bizkit's best album. Sad to say, they have depreciated since they released their debut. Their later albums have had stronger singles (Nookie, Take A Look Around), but the albums as a whole can't hold a candle to this one, they lack the pure energy Limp has here. They blend the rap and metal seamlessly, making it actually fun to listen to, rather than incredibly annoying like on their later albums. Almost every song here is worth a listen, even the Intro track, while the Intro's and Outro's to Sig. Other and Chocolate Starfish aren't even worth the CD space they take up. &quot;Pollution&quot; is a great track, along with &quot;Counterfeit,&quot; &quot;Nobody Loves Me,&quot; &quot;Indigo Flow&quot; and the George Micheals cover &quot;Faith.&quot; If you want Limp Bizkit, check out this album.
B0000584V3|5.0|I purchased this album as soon as I could get it.  I own all of Opeth's previous releases.<br />I'm not sure I can add much more praise to this album.  If you have any of Opeth's other albums, you will buy this one.  If you do not own an Opeth album, it doesn't matter which one is picked up first, they are all excellent.  <br />Opeth is progressive-like-death-like-metal-like music.  What does that mean?  The band is not afraid to use acoustic guitars, a piano, or any other variation that may work.  Overall there are harsh growled vocals and guitars that are loud and rock.  The vocals change between a death growl and a very clear and pleasant sound.  Two very active guitars on the album, and a bass that stands out more than it did on Still Life, but not as active as on Monringrise.  The songs are longer than the average 3 to 4 minutes, be prepaired to be at attention for an average of 10 minutes.  <br />This album seems a bit busier than the previous albums.  Complex stuff that may need a few listens to decifer.  Favorites of mine on the album are Bleak, Harvest, and The Funeral Portrait. Bleak is one of the heavies on the album and Harvest is an all acoustic track.  Funeral Portrait has the best riff on the album and is some nice meat in the sandwich of the album. <br />My only hope is that Opeth doesn't grow stale before they get big.  These will be the albums retro-death metal heads will have in the year 2010.  If you appreciate more technical death metal, you should like Blackwater Park.  Opeth doesn't unleash unbridled hatred, they simply tell a story instead with thier music.  You need to tell a friend of Opeth.  <br />This album is worth your time and your money.

B00004XOWM|2.0|Limp Bizkit has very little talent as a band most of the time, and Chocolate Starfish proves it. Most of the songs on here are insanley mindless, yet they somehow convinced millions of people to pay $15 for this peice of crap. Fred's rapping, for instance, is hideous. I'm not a big rap fan, but I can still tell who is good and who isn't, and Fred is at the bottom of the pile on this album. The song Hot Dog is probably the worst here, &quot;F--- this, F--- that.&quot; Gimme a break Fred. Still, some of the songs on here demand attention. Like &quot;Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle),&quot; which, although lyrically pathetic, is just a really fun song to listen to. Other good tracks here are the Mission Impossible 2 theme &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; one of Limp Bizkits best songs, if not the best. Also listen to &quot;Hold On,&quot; a different pace for Limp, but very good; &quot;It'll Be OK&quot; is another good one. These few songs are good, but the album as a whole stinks. However, if you like it, I also suggest Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill Y'All, because they are pretty much the same as Chocolate Starfish.

After devouring the first five books in a flash--the word &quot;devouring&quot; here does not mean that we hastily gobbled them up, but rather that we were compelled to read them rapidly in succession--we immediately e-bought Book 6, &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot; and Book 7, &quot;The Vile Village.&quot;  Lemony Snicket's unrelenting(ly funny) account of the misfortunes that befall the Baudelaires is never watered down by saccharine solutions, trust us. Kids 8 and up will find every book in the series hilariously morose and intriguing, including the author's different photos, bios and letters at the end of each book.  Parents and teachers will appreciate the unique and humorous way in which Mr. Snicket introduces new vocabulary to young readers.  For reasons that remain unclear to us even now, we may never know Lemony Snicket as well as we know JK Rowling, but hopefully his series will contine to get even better, or should I say, worse?

B000002J1H|5.0|YES is without a doubt the definitive prog-rock band.Possesing some of the most musically talented people that have ever been heard on a rock album.GOING FOR THE ONE is just another in a long line of incredible progressive rock albums.Heralding the return of the great Rick Wakeman,GFTO contains some awesome music.AWAKEN..what more can I say about it?..simply one of YES's finest moments(and there are thousands!).Jon's vocals soar unlike anything i've ever heard on AWAKEN.The title track is a great rocker with Mr.Howe ripping up the guitar.PARALLELS features a more streamlined rock sound with great work by Wakeman.WONDEROUS STORIES is a very good ballad but TURN OF THE CENTURY may be YES's most heartfelt song ever.On CENTURY everyones playing is perfect and Anderson's singing is nothing short of remarkable.I rank GOING FOR THE ONE right up there with THE YES ALBUM,CLOSE TO THE EDGE,TALES,and RELAYER as the best work from the ultimate rock band.
B00001ZULV|5.0|An impressive anthology finally released in the late `90's by a band spanning three of the four decades rock 'n roll has truly been active in the public eye (ear?). A genuine effort to demonstrate the enthusiasm and song diversity this group over the years has come to pioneer/define. At last, dedicated fans of this talented rock group are able to include in their CD libraries evidence of the most respected band compositions. The desirable smash ranks of ABACAB, INVISIBLE TOUCH, IN TOO DEEP, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, MISUNDERSTANDING, LAND OF CONFUSION, and FOLLOW YOU, FOLLOW ME are all assembled here as well as the enticing tribal effect of CONGA plus others. Put into a unique professional order perspective, these tracks give the listener an honest representation of the accomplishments by which to some degree or another this reputable band ultimately came to symbolize.<br />   I can't deny the fact that a number of memorable classics were left out. Unfortunately, NO REPLY AT ALL, ILLEGAL ALIEN, + TAKING IT ALL TOO HARD to mention a few, were not included in this hits compilation. For myself, this did not prove any great hardship. Albeit such singles were popular at some point or another, their ommision was acceptable as none contributed to any great length or detail the band's progressive sound and/or commitment. Besides, no respectful band can or should be expected to submit onto disc every favorite musical timepiece without almost feeling like they sold their song rights to PolyTel, Sony Music or similar commercial affiliation. This CD does its best to give all Genesis devotees a way to recapture times of the past and embrace the epic achievements that today are so very much cherished amongst avid group followers. TURN IT ON AGAIN - THE HITS is a terrific audio undertaking for all Rock enthusiasts set to experience the Genesis phenomena once again and always, giving a light slap on the face to any spiteful well-wisher...

B000002VCU|5.0|Like I ROBOT,there isnt a weak spot on FRIENDLY CARD.MAY BE A PRICE TO PAY is a great song to lead off the album with typically strong Parsons lyrics and melodies.GAMES PEOPLE PLAY is a great upbeat tune that still gets plenty of airplay.TIME just may be the most heartfelt song of all time.Eric Woolfson's vocals on TIME are phenomenal.GOLD BUG is another in a long line of great Parsons instrumentals.SNAKE EYES is a song that should have done much better on the charts than it did.The title track is one of the most powerful songs that the project has ever done.NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE is another heartfelt song sung beautifully by Woolfson.While all of Parsons albums are very good,I would rank FRIENDLY CARD with I ROBOT as Parson's best work.
B00000099Y|5.0|Four years ago I listened to Tupac, Coolio, Dr. Dre, and other types of rap. My favorite types of music were the ones you heard on MTV.  I mocked this head-banging music people were listning to, thinking it was just for [those] who didnt actually like music, and just wanted to rebel. I remember a friend always coined the term &quot;Tool's Cool&quot;, and thought that sounded retarted. Well, I listened to this cd, Anema.. and right now I listen to groups like Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd, Gravity Kills... and lots more. Tool totaly opened me up to new music. Its amazing that *Tool* was my gateway music from rap to actual music.  Right now im even ashamed to having liked the music I used to.  Aenima is just plain increadible, and no one would make a mistake by buying this album.
0452282152|4.0|&quot;Girl&quot; doesn't exactly qualify as compelling fiction. It moves along at its own quiet pace, threatening stagnation at times. Chevalier's prosaic, spare style actually suits the subject matter quite well, however. It reflects Dutch society of the period, which was not about &quot;flash,&quot; to put it mildly. The author does a superior job of depicting the straight-laced, mercantile society of late-Rennaissance Delft. She is also shrewd in her decision to focus on the barter system, the spring which provided movement to the social mechanism throughout Holland. Griet metes out small sexual favors to the butcher, Pieter, for instance, in exchange for information about her family, who have been quarantined due to an outbreak of the plague. Vermeer's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, acts as the artist's agent as well as the head of the household. She is interested primarily in the money a particular painting will bring in, rather the aesthetic result.<br />  There are some problem areas with the narrative. The chief being a matter of &quot;willing suspension of disbelief.&quot; Griet, the narrator, at one point informs us that she can barely sign her name and that she is illiterate. At no point in the novel does she relate how she came by the ability to write her story down, and given the nature of her position later in life, it would beg credulity to see how she could have taught herself to read and write. This could easily be dismissed as artistic license, but Griet's own standards are so precise and exacting, that the flaw seems more glaring in context. One other minor negative is stylistic. Chevalier is at her best when she sticks to the straightforward prose that predominates here. Sometimes, however, she allows Griet a rhetorical flight into poetry land and the result borders on the risible, as when she mentions the smell?/sound? of a particular brick mortar. The editor just missed that one, apparently. On the whole, however, this novel is extremely well-written and Chevalier is particularly adept at delineating period and character.written and Chevalier is particularly adept at delineating period and character.
0679879269|3.0|The Golden Compass hooked me into this fabulous series.  The subtle knife took it in a brand new direction.  Those two books set a standard for &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; that I don't feel Pullman remained true to in The Amber Spyglass.  <br />It seems to me that Pullman used The Amber Spyglass to preach the details of his own particular brand of secular humanism to an already devoted group of fans.  Although I personaly do not prescribe to his particular view, I am willing to accept most any belief system as it forms a basis for fantasy and science fiction writing (after all, it IS a fantasy) but I feel that Pullman rushed the story and cut corners on the character development.  It seems that all of the adult characters are preaching the same message over and over again in various different ways (wait a minute - why is everybody on the same side now?)  <br />This book hardly has a climax and the main events that seemed to power the story in the first two books are over almost before you realize it.  The last few chapters are quite good and do offer a great ending to the series, but the middle 2/3 of the book is not an example of Pullman at his finest.  Read this book to finish the series, but beware that it is much less story and more philosophy / anti-religion than the other two books.
B00004SVIK|4.0|20 years after the original chart-topper hit the road, we are finally graced with the definitive recording of those very few, and fondly remembered, live performances. While some of the numbers seem constrained, when the difficulties that were part and parcel of performing a set of this maginitude and complexity are taken in account, this is a truly amazing performance.  David Gilmour is simply on fire during &quot;Another Brick In The Wall PtII&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. The whole band cooks on &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;. And the grand-finale, &quot;The Trial&quot;, is letter perfect. There isn't a note out of place or a sound-effect forgotten. For those who were lucky enough to have been present at any of these performances during the '80-'81 tour, this is a serious blast from the past that will literally make the hairs on you neck stand at attention. If you weren't able to catch any of these ground breaking performances, then &quot;Is The Anybody Out There?&quot; is a great way to expereince Pink Floyd at their peak.
6303027016|5.0|This is a rather old film on the Vietnam War. It has aged. The denunciation of the censorship that existed in the US forces in Vietnam, is still efficient, but it deals with the past. The Vietnam War is finished. The humor about the ex-Vice-Pr&eacute;sident Nixon, is of course a lot less efficient today, because a lot of time has gone by. The vision of the war is still very mild, though it emphasizes, still, the fact that the Viet Congs were everywhere, and it states in a very few sentences the real motivations of these young people who joined the fight against the Americans : personal, victims all around them, and the fact that they were at home, and the Americans were not.<br />But the film has taken, since its first release, a completely new meaning, more allegoric but also tremendously strong. This time it has do only with the functioning of an institution, no matter which, that has to respect some norms coming from above and not from its audience, its public. It has to do with censorship and the desire and tendency of some people to refuse it in the name of the good old freedom of expression and of the press. Just this point, repeated quite many times, shows how strong such a functioning is. But the film delves into the human relations that come along with this general functioning. Those who detain authority in this institution feel frustrated by those who rebel against the censorship they try to impose. And it reveals that the former will try to do anything they can do get rid of the troublemaker : they will send him on an impossible and death-ridden mission, hoping he will be killed ; then they will build up a file trying to show that he is a traitor and has to be courtmartialed, and then they will condescendently move him out of the way with a nice speech on generosity, clemency and even compassion. This denunciation of this terroristic functioning of any institution, public or private, is still valid and full of relevence. On that level the film has not aged one single iota.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.single iota. <br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B0000584V3|5.0|I got this cd not expecting what to get. I heard several good things about this band, and I decided to take a chance. One of the best decisions of my life, next to buying the System Of A Down cd. But one word of warning. If you buy the cd expecting death metal, you will be dissapointed. This is NOT death metal, aside from the grindcore vocals, there is nothing about them that even comes close to death metal. They're doom metal. Which is very depressing and (Kinda've) softer than most metal. Usually with death vocals and acoustic passages, which is evident in this cd. The only complaint I have is that there is not enough! I just wish they had more songs on the cd! But when they're over 8 minutes long...
B00004XQ83|5.0|This soundtrack is filled with the sounds of bluegrass, blues, and early country music.  All of the songs on it are early classics that came from around the same time period as the movie.  They are all really old sounding but the lyrics, music, and voices in the songs shine forth with a classic and timeless aura that can only make you smile.  There is a classic purity in these songs that has been lost in modern day music.  Some of the highlights of the soundtrack are: &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot;, &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;, &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, and &quot;In the Jailhouse Now.&quot;  I love &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; it is such a dreamy and optimistic song that perfectly describes the feeling of what the depression was probably like.  &quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; is awesome and probably the best song on the album.  This is the perfect kind of music if your feeling sad, happy, lonely, depressed, or anything because that is the scope of the feelings expressed through the songs on this album.  I think anyone could enjoy this album because the music on it is so full of feeling and joy.

B00000IQBL|5.0|Stanley Kubrick, in this film, apparently deals with two problems by cutting the film in two separate parts, and yet he only deals with one problem that goes beyond the two parts and reunifies the film. In the first part he gives us a precise, accurate and nearly sickening description of the training of a Marine in the US.<br /><br />This training has to do with brainwashing, physical training and ideological conditioning. The objective is not to produce robots, but Marines who are so well conditioned that killing is their first reflex in a war situation. « Born to kill » as they say. This first part leads to a drama because in the mass of new recruits, there is, not a rotten apple, but one who cannot stand the brainwashing, because he cannot erase some of his old psychological attachments.<br /><br />His unconscuious reacts against the brainwashing and turns the brainwashing against the trainer and against the owner of this unconscious : to kill becomes to settle accounts (in vengeance) and to commit suicide. In the second part,  Kubrick gives us a vision of the Tet offensive in 1968, hence of the dramatic turning point of the Vietnam War that will eventually mean the American defeat.<br /><br />There we find again some of the characters of the first part and a few others and Kubrick describes how the killing instinct of these Marines has become the only survival strategy they have. They can survive and even remain sane because they kill, blindly and without thinking. Kubrick even goes further by showing that this leads to deranged personalities.<br /><br />One case is only quoted, but the main hero is confronted, right at the end, no longer with the blind reflex, but with the necessity to kill in order to respect some deep belief he has (suffering is not justified on a moral level) and the necessity to kill willingly, out of a conscious resolution.<br /><br />This leads to two possibilities : either the Marine is an animal and he will let the wounded person die, hence suffer, thus showing that he has no more moral values, or he will kill just as if it were an ordinary and simple action like drinking, eating or anything else, thus showing that he has no more moral values, no sense of perspective.<br /><br />And that's where the film gets its unity : either the Marine has become a robot for whom killing is as simple as breathing, or the conditioning is in contradiction with ethical values, making the reflex difficult if not impossible. Killing becomes then a regressive attitude and the film can end up on Disneyland famous song : M.I.C.K.E.Y.M.O.U.S.E. And this last image of Marines coming back from their exterminating mission for the night and singing that song, shows how deep war can make people sink. The last scene is poignant and revealing.

B00003CXB2|5.0|Well, this is the one, isn't it?  The Big Daddy of all epics.  And, here it is gloriously presented on DVD.  Of course Lawrence of Arabia should be seen on the big screen, but failing that, this is your next best option (especially if you have Big Screen TV and surround sound).<br />Lawrence of Arabia has become, like Citizen Kane before it, synonymous with greatness and near-perfection.  Well, it does not disappoint.  Fastidious and glorious in all its facets from casting to music score, it is grand entertainment.<br />It is for sure that you will never see another like it.  Even if you could afford it, it would be unlikely you would be able to keep a cast &amp; crew dedicated to filming in the desert for over 2 years, as David Lean did!<br />And what did that kind of dedication yield?  Just some of the greatest production and cinematic values ever put on film.  It was breathtaking 40 years ago, and it is breathtaking today.<br />With a riveting, star-making performance by Peter O'Toole as the driven, enigmatic Lawrence at its center, surrounded by an exquisite cast, and with, as Steven Spielberg says &quot;perhaps the best script ever written&quot; David Lean's obsessive perfectionism created a masterpiece for all time.<br />Quite simply, it is not to be missed.  The DVD is beautiful and reminded me how, as it did Spielberg, this movie just blew me away when I saw it in its first release.<br />The DVD extras are nice, especially the aforementioned talk by Spielberg and a nice &quot;making of&quot; documentary with a mixture of location shots and more recent recollections by the players.<br />This is one of the great, unique achievements in film: art &amp; entertainment in a seamless, wonderful &amp; unmatched mixture.  It is a Masterpiece.
0064471837|5.0|As most reviewers may have already said, this book is amazing. It is chock-full of action and adventure with a surprising yet satisfying ending. Sabriel is the main charcter of the book. She is 18 years old and goes to school at Wyverley College, which is in another world. In this other world, the landscape is divided by a gigantic wall, known as (none other than) the Wall. The modern world, where Sabriel is growing up is called Ancelstierre. Ancelstierre is much like our own world. Meanwhile, beyond the wall, is the Old Kingdom, the place full of magic and unfortunately, the dead who crossed over. When Sabriel's father, who happens to be an Abhorsen (one who puts the dead to rest), the opposite of a necromancer (one who raises the dead)doesn't visit Sabriel at his usual time, things start to get fishy. Throughout the book, there are twists and turns in the plot and you get to meet fascinating characters called Mogget and Touchstone. I deeply recommend this book. Also read Lirael, the sequel to Sabriel!
0743420373|4.0|At first thought, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out, or anyone who is new with the concept of budgeting.  It may rank up there as probably the second best gift you can give to someone for their college or high school graduation (money is always #1!!!)<br />Anyway, the reason I have mixed reviews is because of the books length.  While it isn't a big book, half of the book could be chopped off.  Does the work redundancy mean anything!!!  The authors, who did a good job of making a point, went beyond being thorough, and beyond being wordy.<br />The book more or less says to not spend what you can and save as much as possible.  I recommend to read about 2/3 of this book, and then pass it on to someone else.  You will be better for it, and they will appreciate it.
6305728437|5.0|As the 36th animated masterpiece, this has to be the funniest movie yet. I could not stop laughing. The adorable, mischievous dragon (Mushu) has Eddie Murphy's voice and is perhaps the cutest animation I have ever seen. Watch for what guardian dragon Mushu does when he is trying to explain why he is not \\"just\\" a lizard. It will knock your funny socks off.<br /><br />Mulan is extremely beautiful and her facial expressions make you actually feel everything she is feeling emotionally. I was so amazed they could put so much feeling into an animated character. Her lovable and tenacious spirit is admirable. She also seems to always be getting into trouble and the slapstick humor is the best I have ever seen in a Disney movie. The \\"lucky\\" cricket is a kind of side kick for the dragon and is supposed to bring Mulan luck.<br /><br />This is based on an ancient Chinese legend in which a girl disguises herself as a soldier to protect her aging father so he doesn't have to go to war against the Hun army (the soldiers all look like wrestlers) which has come across the northern border. Mulan trains for war and proves herself quite capable of learning martial arts and excelling at all areas of military training.<br /><br />The movie has a rather ominous beginning, a hilarious center and a memorable ending. It is just perfect to say the least. Through the movie Mulan is always trying to be the perfect daughter. What her father says at the end of the movie is so beautiful and shows the unconditional love between parent and child.<br /><br />The main point to the movie is to allow children to become the person they are inside. To nurture their true gifts and to give them unconditional love. \\"The children of our country materially have just about everything, but what they're often lacking is love and attention.\\" -Johann Christoph Arnold<br /><br />In the Chinese culture, honor is very important, so this aspect is very prominent throughout the movie. In a way, it could help a child to realize that it is fine to be proud of your country.

While at Uncle Homer's farm, Wilbur meets Templeton, Charlotte, and a lot of others.  Wilbur finds out that he is to be killed and made into ham and bacon.  With the help of Charlotte and Templeton, he will not become anyone's meal.  <br /> Charlotte's Web defines what mothering should be and what one needs to become a successful mother. Garth Williams, the illustrator of Charlotte's Web, uses detailed illustrations and imagery to convey messages about mothering in this novel.  According to Lucy Rollin in her article, \\"The Reproduction of Mothering in Charlotte's Web,\\" \\"Mothering in our culture is part of an economic system that contributes to sexual inequality and that relies above all on internalized gender distinctions\\" (Rollin 42). Throughout this novel, White uses Wilbur to suggest that males are as capable of mothering as females are.  <br /> The first example of mothering appears at the beginning of the book.  When Fern finds out that her father is about to kill the little runt pig, she pleads for Wilbur's life.  Fern cries, \\"But it's unfair.  The pig could not help being small, could it?\\" (White 3).  The illustration shows Fern tussling, with her father trying to keep him from killing the runt.  Fern takes the responsibility of raising the runt, which she names Wilbur.  Fern takes care of Wilbur every day.  She feeds him in the mornings, goes to school, and comes back home to care for him.  One illustration shows Fern cradling Wilbur in her arms and feeding him like an infant.  Rollin states, \\"Feeding and touch are the utmost importance in mothering\\" (Rollin 43).  <br /> Later when the Arables send Wilbur to Uncle Homer's farm, Wilbur feels sad because of Fern's absence.  In Chapter 3, the narrator says, \\"He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of laying down\\" (White 16).  Fern visits Wilbur, but as time goes by, she begins to visit him less frequently.  After a time, Wilbur meets Charlotte, who displays a form of mothering, although not in the same form as Fern.  Rollin states, \\"She accomplishes her mothering solely through language\\" (44).  Charlotte's mothering differs from Fern's because Charlotte's impact on Wilbur is more of a hands-off approach.  For example, when Wilbur feels lonely and sad, Charlotte touches him with her words of encouragement.  This relates to Rollin's quote about touch being important in mothering. When Charlotte finds out that Wilbur is going to be killed, she gives advice, encouragement, and promises to find a way to save his life.  She uses her web to weave complimentary words about Wilbur.  Templeton helps by finding papers with words on them to assist Charlotte in carrying out her plans. Charlotte describes Wilbur as \\"some pig,\\" \\"terrific,\\" \\"radiant,\\" and \\"humble.\\"  This makes everyone think about Wilbur's greatness. Charlotte's plan saves Wilbur's life.<br /> Finally, at the book's end, Wilbur finds out that he is going to the fair to win the prize, to which he promptly asks Charlotte to accompany him. Charlotte tells Wilbur that she might not be able to go because it is nearly time for her to make her egg sac.  In Chapter 16, Wilbur goes to the fair with his companions, Charlotte and Templeton.  At the fair, Templeton goes out and finds a word, and then Charlotte weaves a web.  Afterwards, she lays her eggs.  Charlotte tells Wilbur that she is going to die soon.  Wilbur is sad, but he takes the responsibility of taking care of Charlotte's eggs.  He asks Templeton to climb up and retrieve the egg sac.  Templeton refuses to do so until he gets something in return.  Wilbur sacrifices his food for Templeton to get the egg sac.  Templeton gives Wilbur the egg sac, and then Wilbur carries the egg sac back to the farm in his mouth.  The mothering role shifts gender because Charlotte charges Wilbur with the responsibility of mothering her eggs through the winter.  Wilbur monitors the eggs every day until they hatch.  After they hatch, he takes the responsibility of caring for them.  \\"Wilbur's mothering differs from the females.  He does name the spiders as Fern named him, and he mothers with words as Charlotte did,\\" states Rollin (46).  Wilbur's mothering differs from Fern's because she wants the responsibility of loving and raising Wilbur.  In contrast, Wilbur only takes responsibility for Charlotte's eggs because of her death.  Wilbur's mothering differs from Charlotte because she reproduces the eggs, while Wilbur only takes part in watching over the eggs.  Despite Wilbur's differences in mothering and gender distinction, mothering was the only role he played in this book.

0446604844|1.0|This book had the good story line, but the details were not there to support the plot.  Suspense is not having the main character running around like a loose cannon never seeing farther than the end of her nose.  I can't think what parts irritated me more, but the total incompetence of Sidney at times playing into the hands of the &quot;bad guys&quot; didn't cut it with me.

B00003CXBK|2.0|I have not seen (heard) the Japanese version, not that I would understand it, but I'm sure it must be better than the english version. I agree with those who consider some of the voice acting to be out of place. The accents do sound strange and often the characters shout their lines which seems very contrived, awkward and unnecessary. The producers should have eschewed big name movie and television stars in favor of genuine professional voice actors. But often, the english version of the script is at fault. Many of the character's lines are downright corny. Indeed, the entire movie is excessively melodramatic, causing me to almost cringe. For instance, the scene where wolf girl has to chew the food for the hero is really too much. Like I said, the Japanese version is probably much better but I suspect the plot is still too convoluted. I think they tried to do too much with the story to its overall detriment. Overall I found the film disappointing and would not recommend it.
B000006NPY|1.0|look, i love their first couple of albums, and am willing to grow with a band.for the first few years that they were around they were great, and very original.even &quot;pisces iscariot&quot;,a collection of outtakes was awesome(and my second favorite album they did).but when this came out,i wasted my money on a pile of over indulgent proto-prog nonsense.these guys have become so out of touch,as they are now big rock stars,and billy has nothing to write about,except boring,love songs, and stuff only a celebrity can relate to.and hey, i have no problem with an artist being self indulgent if its gonna create good art,but this is just billy corgan stroking his ego.as a fan of punk, this gets to my very core.and than they come out with &quot;machina/the machines of god&quot; garbage(that thankfully i did not buy.i heard it from a friend,and wanted the time spent listening to it back).im so glad they broke up.to bad they dident years ago,and save the world this headache.thank god rancid and propagandhi came out with their new albums.one thing you can count on with them and bands like them, they wont become huge sheltered rock stars and lose their edge and intensity and make boring pompous dung.
B000002GJH|5.0|None of the songs, not even Hunger Strike, is particularly radio friendly so it takes a while to get used to the album. But after repeated listening, one overcomes the feeling that the songs are a big mess jumbled together and begins rather to appreciate their spontaneity, originality and earnestness. There is a lack of polish to a lot of the songs but this is definitely a good thing since this gives them personality. A lot of music these days seems too slick and overproduced for its own good.<br />The songwriting is loose as I've indicated, and as such, many songs are not intrinsically that great, but it allows the band freedom to just play. Chris Cornell's unique, powerful yet emotive voice greatly enhances songs like Troubled Times and Wooden Jesus. Meanwhile, Matt Cameron's drumming sounds so good throughout, I often find myself specifically listening to it. One of my favourite moments on the album is the spacey outro to Your Savior. I did not like that song for a long time but eventually I discovered its merits (or its merits impressed themselves upon me). This is typical of Temple of the Dog. The album is not trying to sell itself or make people like it so many will dismiss it quickly (especially those expecting Pearl Jam). But if you give it enough of a chance, you'll discover some tremendous music. <br />P.S. Don't overlook the last song, All Night Thing. It is, in my opinion, a truly inspired song.
B00004XONN|5.0|ok, first off, how do you compare this album to anything else they have done? is this better than &quot;ok computer&quot;? mabye, but ok computer was for all intents and purposes a guitar album, albeit a very unconvential one.this album just washes everything they did on that album and previous down the drain.i really like &quot;pablo honey&quot;,as its a catchy,yet hard rem/buzzcocks type album, while &quot;the bends&quot; is like the &quot;revolver&quot; of my generation.at that point they had made an album that they could not, if that is, they tried to make another one using the same approach, so they went in a somewhat differant direction with &quot;ok computer&quot;, making a more subtle,almost anti-guitar record.yes, it was a masterpiece,so how do they top that? disregard all conventions,ignore standard song structres,and replace their regular intruments with other ones.what you have is an album that defies logic.this is not supposed to work.its supposed to be a let down.well its not.not even close.it is(at the moment anyway) my favorite album they have done.when i first heard it i was amazed at how weird and quiet it is.it hits you in a completly differant way, from a very strange angle.yes every song is great and fresh and touching in that radiohead way,but there is something more.i listened to it for a few days after getting it,than lost intrest for a couple of months,barely putting it on at all.that one day, i was up late at night,reading some rollins,and thought id give it another go.that was 2 months ago.now i cant get it out of my head.its such a cliche,&quot;you hear something differant each time you listen to it&quot;, but its so true about this album.&quot;treefingers&quot; with its hazy warmth, &quot;kid a&quot;,a song that sounds like a sick lullaby,&quot;the national anthem&quot; the centrepiece of the album that explodes into crazy jazz at the end.at first the 10 songs sound disjointed,and like they dont fit together,but when you go back and listen to it as a whole(which i think is the best way to feel the full effect), they flow into one another.my only dissapointment with the album is that there are only 10 songs, but ill take 10 great songs over 12 or 15 ok ones.and hey, they got a new album coming out in june.get ready.
0553274503|4.0|I didnt exactly read the book..but I read (a shortened version, I beleive) in my English class.  The story was very sad, and it might be boring to some kids.  I liked the story though, and I encourage reading at least the shorter version.
0064407667|4.0|I thought this book was great - I loved the dark humor and the slightly pompous, over-the-top writing style. I don't find it at all depressing or nihilistic (as some of the critics here put it)for two reasons: first of all, these books read very much like FAIRY TALES, not realistic literature. The Baudelaires' predicament reminded me very much of Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, etc. etc. Are those stories depressing? Secondly, the Baudelaires are not passive victims. Through their intelligence, bravery and resourcefulness, they outwit and triumph over the evil Count Olaf. I find that empowering. True, they don't wind up in a happy ending, but they DO defeat the bad guy, and go on to further adventures. I also like the fact that Violet is a strong heroine, and that the books really stress the idea that reading is valuable. The Baudelaires read voraciously, both for pleasure and to research ways of foiling their oppressors. I agree that these books aren't for little kids, but certainly the 9-to-12-year-old crowd can enjoy them.
B000001IPL|5.0|Following on the heels of the likable but larglely un-recognised &quot;Ignition&quot;, Smash was the defining moment in the bands collection. The sound lacks the polish of the later works (e.g Americana) and is far more enjoyable because of it. Raw sound, plently of aggression and well considered lyrics. Best tracks &quot;Gotta get away&quot;, &quot;Come out and play&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;. Forget the more recent mainstream stuff, this is The Offspring at their best.
B000002KOO|3.0|Fleetwood Mac originally a band that was heavily influenced by the blues in the vein of the early Yardbirds and The Bluesbreakers.  Peter Green was the leader of the band that took its name from their powerhouse rhythm section of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie.  Jeremy Spencer was the second guitarist in the band that at first a quartet.  On Then Play On they added a third guitarist Danny Kirwan and achieve a minor chart success.  This version of the band had little in common with their future, mega successful version.  But that aside, Then Play On contains some excellent guitar work and enjoyable songs.  &quot;Oh Well&quot; is an amazing song and it showed the true genius of the tortured Mr. Green.  The rest of the album is a solid, workman like effort.
B000002C1V|5.0|Not an album that immediatly appeals to the ear. Much of the sound is sudden and raw. Intially it is hard to reconcile the raw sound with the softly spoken lyrics. But its addictive, an album that you grow to love the more you listen. Reflecting on the post war dream and how the post modern world has failed to deliver. The lyrics are intelligent and show glimmers of a very dry English wit. Top tracks &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, &quot;Southampton Dock&quot;. Buy it and listern to it until it makes perfect sense.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I don't remember where I was or what I was doing when I first heard LC, but I remember how it made me feel. And that's what matters. And I still feel that way when I listen to it today. Liberated.
B00001NFCY|3.0|Too soon after the release of the excellent &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, the lyrics are often soppy and cliche ridden. (eg. 'with arms wide open'). The sound hasn't changed but the message has become blurred in an attempt to please the mass market. The religious overtones are far more pronounced. Its still a worth while listen but an album with a interest lifespan of a couple of months
6302293553|3.0|If you're a true fan of Monty Python, this is one movie you'll definitely want to own as it has all the trademark qualities of Python silliness and wit. However, if you're only a casual Python fan then this movie may not appeal to you.<br />The movie opens with a hilarious conversation about coconuts between King Arthur and some guards on a castle rampart. From there, things get even sillier. <br />Another thing that makes this film fun to watch is the skillful animation of Terry Gilliam. The cartoon segment where King Arthur and his men encounter God is especially funny as is the scene where Arthur and his men run away from the dreaded black beast.<br />Essentially, THG is a compilation of funny skits that are loosely held together by a contrived plot. THG is one movie that will definitely keep you in stitches but it will also let you down as the ending is rather weak--to say the least!<br />Having seen this film several times over the past two decades, it seems to me that THG was more than the Python gang could handle. This film has an aura of impatience about it and it seems that the Python troupe were glad to get it done and over with. In light of this, this film probably deserves 2 1/2 stars due to its lack of continuity. Nevertheless, this film does show the comedic genius of Monty Python and I would have to say it's definitely worth seeing at least once.
B000002A3T|4.0|Written years after the previous works, &quot;the division bell&quot; has much of the raw feel of the previous works while still being decidedly modern and polished. The division bell features some modern classics such as 'High hopes', 'Keep Talking' and is a very enjoyable and intelligent album. Probably the bands biggest move into popular sound it is a must for all CD collections
630157401X|2.0|One would think that if you put two established actors like Harrison Ford and Sean Connery together in the same film, you'd have an exciting, action-packed movie. Instead, what you get in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; is a stale variation of  &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot; <br />In this third installment of the Indiana Jones series, the chemistry between Ford and Connery, if it exists at all, is awkward and never seems to click. Both Connery and Ford also have a larger-than-life super hero status in this film which I found rather unconvincing.<br />&quot;The Last Crusade's&quot; plot of the good guys vs. the evil Nazis is hardly originial as it has been worked to death in so many other action-adventure movies. This makes for a very predictable plot and the viewer can almost figure out the ending even before the movie's over.<br />Although &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; lacks originality and is something of a retread of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; I still think it's an improvement over &quot;The Temple of Doom.&quot; But that's not saying much. Of the three films in the Indiana Jones trilogy, &quot;Raiders&quot; is the best of the three and it's one you'll definitely want to own. As for the others, rent them and then forget them.
0789723107|4.0|As an experienced user-interface designer and author of another UI design book (GUI Bloopers), I expected &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; just to confirm things I already knew.  In fact, I learned from it.  How to reduce the amount of text on a page, for example, and the value of doing so.  I immediately used that knowledge to help my wife cut the text on... not a website, but a printed brochure she was creating.<br />Overall, I think this is a valuable book.  It's a quick read.  The advice in it is sound and well-explained.  It will be read by many, many more people than will read most other Web and GUI design books.  It will reduce the number of clueless Web-designers, and that is good.<br />My only concern is that many readers of &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; may be fooled into believing that this is all there is to it:  just read this short book, and you too can be as good a web-designer as Steve Krug.  Unfortunately, it ain't so.<br />For example, an easy-to-use e-commerce website requires not just well-designed pages, but also back-end services that were designed in a user-centered way.  You can't slap a user-friendly front end onto a back-end that was designed with no thought to users and their tasks.  Another example:  Krug makes usability testing sound easy, but doesn't warn that:  a) the videotape release and non-disclosure forms will have to be run by your lawyers, who will thwart your intent to make it &quot;short and in plain English&quot;, and b) paying test-users in cash has IRS implications you may wish to avoid, so it's often better to &quot;pay&quot; in merchandise or gift-certificates.
B000002OZY|3.0|\\"Tommy\\" has been touted as The Who's first masterpiece but if you look past the hype, you'll find that \\"Tommy\\" lacks substance. Innovative? Yes! Consistent? No!<br />Unlike \\"Quadrophenia,\\" \\"Tommy\\" doesn't flow very well as some of the songs are misplaced in sequence. For example, I'll never understand why \\"I'm Free\\" came after \\"Sally Simpson.\\" Wouldn't it have made more sense to place it after \\"Miracle Cure?\\" I realize this is being nitpicky but I think this album would've been stronger and more cohesive had the songs followed in a more logical sequence.<br />Another weakness of this album, albeit minor, is the production. Inasmuch as \\"Quadrophenia\\" suffers from overproduction, \\"Tommy\\" suffers from being too simplistic. The sound on this album is rather hollow at times and I can't help but think that if there been a more capable producer (e.g., Glyn Johns) on hand at the time then maybe this album wouldn't sound as dated.<br />Much of the material on \\"Tommy\\" is rather uneven. What's good is very good but what's bad is awful. Among the best songs on this album are \\"Overture,\\" \\"Amazing Journey,\\" \\"Sparks\\" and \\"Christmas.\\" \\"Fiddle About\\" and \\"Cousin Kevin\\" are sick songs that are further diminished by Messrs. Entwistle and Townshend's inability to carry a tune. The rest of the material on this album is at least average.<br />All in all, I'd have to say that \\"Tommy\\" is basically a good album but when you compare it to some of The Who's other albums, it doesn't quite measure-up. Still, this album does have its moments and it's one no Who fan should be without.

These simple songs contain something profound which I believe is unique to them.  That is, they have soul- original, honest, and exposed soul.  This frank beauty and harmony will grip you if you have anything human in you.  It will take you on a journey, a journey that is worth taking.  In fact, it is one I am glad I didn't miss.

1567184855|5.0|Michael Newton's Journey of Souls is so compelling that it is difficult to ignore his findings. He has substantiated the existence of a spirit world and the fact that we all have spiritual guides who monitor our behavior here on earth. That really blew my mind. <br />The information on reincarnation is also compelling. A true lover of this book may want to read Marna Leaks' Confessions of a Sister Out of Time. This book illustrates many of Dr. Newton's findiings.

Sell-out House Music and boring R&amp;B and worst of all...the &quot;Cher-Vocoder-Voice&quot;. Why did they sink so low? I am totally disapointed!! I give it one star because there are one or two tracks that are fair, reminding of the times when they ruled. I'm glad I didn't buy this album...thanx (...)!
0375707972|1.0|for starters, I didn't finish this book, if you could call it a book.  it read like an upscale version of something from penthouse letters.  it was thinly disguised pornography, and trying to pretend to be literary.  also, it struck me that the seduction of the boy by the woman (that boy did not seduce her, that much I know!, he was just a child), was not presented in a way that I felt would have made it genuinely good fiction, or non-fiction for that matter.  what really irked me was that it was presented in a titillating fashion, all about her grabbing his @#$%, etc., which I felt was entirely unnecessary, and in fact, led the reader quite astray.<br />I felt the author had some need of his own to present child sexual abuse in a light that made it look not disturbing, and  while many adolescent boys have or have had fantasies of sexual interactions with full-grown women, by no means would or could or does ANYTHING positive come about in the long run from their fantasies being fulfilled by becoming reality.  it just messes children and adolescents up...<br />so as far as I'm concerned, any book that makes sexual abuse of a child (let's call it by its true name) titillating or racy or exciting for an audience gets only one star in my book.  I wish I could give it &quot;no stars&quot;...
B000007S5B|2.0|My name Is Michael from Denmark, and the only reason why I bought this record, was because of &quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot;, whitch I think is the best song on the album, and because It sounded great when Val Kilmer sang it in the documentary-movie about The Doors. &quot;Five To One&quot; is a good headbanging rocksong, and &quot;Summer's Almost Gone&quot;is a real romantic,but the rest could have been much better, like:&quot;Break On Through and Light My Fire&quot;, but If you are a real addict to The Doors, buy the album, although L.A.Woman and Strange Days are better, both the music and lyrics!!! They're just breaking through(streight to the other side)!!!!!.
0440219078|5.0|I think that the book was one of the best books I have ever read. I don't read that much. The Giver gives a great description of the world that Jonas lives in. I loved the ending.

0800179501|4.0|I hadn't watched this film in a number of years but was reminded of it during a business seminar. There are a good number of principles taught during the movie that are useful everyday. Treat people fairly. Control your emotions. Patience is a virtue. You learn something from every situation - you decide whether you learn something good or bad. The lead character not only represents a young man coming of age but also a person traveling through life and learning to deal with the pitfalls and successes. This movie can be enjoyed on a purely entertainment level as the underdog once again is the victor as well as being viewed on an emotional and physcological level of how to handle different situations we face weekly, if not daily. Watch for fun and watch to learn...either way you will finish the movie with a smile.

0792833201|5.0|Poltergeist is a haunting and moving film. From the opening scene when Carol Anne first talks to the TV to the scary supernatural events that occur later in the film, this film never fails to deliver. The story is very credible and moves along very nicely. Holding it all together is the excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith. His &quot;Carol Anne&quot; theme is one of the most memorable tunes of the 80's. A big nod also goes to the ensemble acting by the excellent cast. You never for a moment doubt these characters. Their ultimate goal of finding their girl at all costs is very heroic. I believe the film has been reclassified as PG-13, due to a scene involving illegal drug use and a scene of extreme gore. Despite some of the good family scenes, this is not a movie for kids under 13.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Okay, here's the deal: Forget all the talk about this being a sci-fi version of &quot;The Tempest.&quot; This film is possibly the pinnacle of sci-fi films of the Atomic Age.<br />This is the film that seemed to have inspired the original Star Trek series, both in theme and style. However, with a larger budget than Star Trek would eventually have, it has much more in the way of bells and whistles.<br />It has a Captain, a fair maiden, a stately scientist, a cadre of astronauts (who really act like WWII Navy men right down to the stereotypically undisciplined &quot;cook&quot; character,) a mysterious robot with unknown intentions, and a force that that threatens to destroy them all.<br />This is one of the few science fiction films from the Fifties that is both entertaining AND intelligent. It does tend to stray at times in a silly subplot about a love triangle, but don't let that deter you from buying this item. It is a keeper.
6301885732|5.0|Dick Tracy is THE best comic book movie ever made. For that matter, one of the best made, period. There is so much to say about this film, that it is hard to point out the best things about it.<br />The art direction, the attention to detail, the music, the acting, the makeup, the story. I could go on and on. You simply can't take your eyes off of it.<br />This is how films used to be made and it is sad that only a few films since have come close to the &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; style of this film (The Mummy most recently.)<br />Al Pacino steals the film! To me, this is HIS film. And I was also impressed by Madonna and Glenne Headly.<br />It is hard to say why most people didn't like this film. Was it not violent enough? Did they want nudity? Did they want something vulgar? Well, if so, they wont get it with this film!<br />I give this film an A+.
6305212112|5.0|Get out the tissues and get ready for laughs and tears as Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy dish out the humor and the sadness that makes &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; such a popular hit among all types of people. The movie is a stunning vignette of life in a time gone by, regailed by an witty old lady to an aging woman who feels her femininity slipping through her fingers. The movie proves that the simplest elements of any friendship are those that are strong enough to survive any ordeal, and it tells this in such a way that one cannot help but enjoy it. For me, the movie strikes such a deep chord within my heart that it kept me captivated throughout: its powerful performances and emotional story is depressing and funny, but proves to be uplifting and joyful. <br />The story centers around the unlikely friendship between octegenarian Ninny Threadgood, who resides at a nursing home that the menopausal Evelyn Couch happens to be visiting one day. The two meet, and Ninny begins to tell her the story of a young, rebellious girl named Igdy Threadgood, who is devastated by the death of her brother Buddy and alienates herself from her family and few friends. Captivated by the conversation, Evelyn cannot help but return for more of the story, and thus begins a close friendship between the two. <br />Ninny's story continues into a mesmerizing tale of emotional strength and courage of two women who refused to allow anything stand in their way. Idgy soon makes her way back into her family's life, with the help of Buddy's sweetheart, Ruth Jamison. Ruth is good-natured and proper, but soon learns the ways of fun and giddiness from Idgy's rambunctious tactics. Their frienship soon begins to flounder when Ruth's marriage separates them, but upon learning that Ruth is being beaten by her husband, she comes to the rescue in a heartbeat. Upon the opening of a restaurant, their relationship grows stronger, ultimately proving that it can survive anything. <br />And there are even morehardships in store for them, ones that cannot be disclosed for fear of giving too much of the suspenseful and sometimes hilarious ending away. There is a mystery involving the characters of the past, one that brings us into its arms and holds tight until the final resolution. <br />Crossed with Ninny's story is the present-day life of Evelyn, whose menopausal outbursts provide some of the funniest film moments to date. Her marriage is all but fulfilling, as displayed in her attempts to get her husband &quot;in the mood.&quot; Attending classes in order to try and rediscover her femininity only succeeds in making her look and feel more foolish. And her sweet nature will not allow her to stand up for herself in any way, shape or form. This is where Ninny's story has such an uplifting impact on her: through the stories of Ruth and Idgy, Evelyn is able to turn her life into the one she has always wanted, with hilarious results. <br />Ninny's story is universal in its themes, but is set in the 1930's in the fictional Southern town of Whistle Stop, which is decribed by Ninny as &quot;a little knock-about place.&quot; The movie doesn't just bring that time and place to life, but instead reincarnates it through vivid use of authentic set designs and costumes. Everything about this film oozes of this period in time, which is essential to a movie whose setting revolves around it. I was more than convinced by it, which allowed me to pay attention to the more important aspects the movie serves up. <br />Its many themes are gloriously portrayed through the two friendships, in different ways and mannerisms. Ruth and Idgy have such a strong bond, and they were able to sell me on that friendship, which is what wins the movie over for me. Their willingness to do anything for one another, and I do mean anything, inspires a very warm feeling of devotion and emotional ties. The friendship between Evelyn and Ninny is so special because of the circumstances under which they meet as wellas the many ways in which Ninny inspires Evelyn to take charge of her life. Like Idgy and Ruth, they are there for one another when the going gets tough, which strengthens their bond and keeps their friendship intriguing to watch unfold. <br />The movie is full of so many elements: laughter, heartwarming emotion, depression, and tears. The laughter comes from the mischievous machinations of Ruth and Idgy, as well as from Evelyn's reawakening. The emotion comes from watching the devotion of these friends, and the lengths they go to for one another. And the tears... they are not so much tears of sadness as they are tears of joy for the message of friendship and togetherness that the movie shouts out. This story speaks to us on so many different levels, and it reaches all of these levels with peak intensity and success. <br />The defining work in this film comes from the incredibly strong performances of the four actresses who bring their characters to life with a brilliant deluge of emotion. Jessica Tandy portrays Ninny with a charm and spry wit that makes her character loveable and realistic. Kathy Bates is a knock-out as Evelyn, and her incredible performance as a woman on the brink of losing her mind and then finding her true happiness is impeccable and delightful. Both Tandy and Bates garnered Academy Awards for their work in this film. Mary Stuart Masterson is the tomboyish Idgy, bringing out all of her character's traits and characteristics meticulously and, it appears, with incredible ease. Mary Louise Parker is convincing as the well-rounded Ruth, retaining her proper ways yet never allowing them to interfere with their friendship. <br />I was highly entertained in many different ways by &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot; The performances were solid and convincing. The characters were intriguing and genuine, emotional and moving. The story speaks out in many ways about the ties of friendship and love, while harnessing all of its themes and messages together without falling short on delivering them. The film proves itself to be a worthy human drama with a solid backbone.
6305910103|5.0|Star Trek II is a wonderful movie. It has everything: action, drama, comedy, horror, a love story (long lost loves meeting again) death, life, and great special effects. Watching it again recently, it finally hit me that the script for this film is terrific, especially the dialogue. Certainly the best of any Star Trek movie and one of the best period. There are so many memorable quotes.<br />Even to this day, Trekkers may watch this film and still have a hard time watching the &quot;sacrifice&quot; near the end of the film. It is still a powerful scene.<br />Those who may have never seen this film, may want to watch the original series episode SPACE SEED. It isn't required, but it would let you see Kahn in action for the first time.<br />Just to be &quot;nitpicky&quot;, how Kahn got to meet Chekov before we met him in the series is weird, but oh well!<br />I give this film an A.
0812550757|5.0|In this book, you are priveleged enough to be able to follow once again the famous Ender Wiggin, aka Andrew, the Xenocide, The original Speaker for the Dead.  This book blends well with the wonderful Ender's game.  Ender has learned a lot from his &quot;adventures&quot; in that book, lessons that have not been forgotten in this great tale.  The characters are as interesting and varied as in Ender's Game.  Ender, freed from his military life, is now an extremely compassionate and admirable grown-up.  The effect of his early life on him is shown clearly through his actions and reactions to the suspenseful plot.  Ender's message of love for all creatures is clearly seen and shown in this heart-warming, though by no means docile or peaceful, tale of courage, hard love, and trust.  The end, I must say at least this:  It leaves you with that feeling of Hope-For-the-Future, just as in Ender's game, and is touching.  You are also left with anxiety, with another newly arisen problem, a reprocussion (sp?) from the actions of the colony, spurred on by Ender.  This book, unlike Ender's Game, follows the hopes, dreams, problems, and joys of more than just Ender, and how these feelings relate to Ender and his mission, not just as a speaker but as the Original one, wanting to erase the hate of others, namely the Buggers, placed in the universe by the Xenocide.  This is all done through the discovery of a new species of sentient being, the piggies.  Learning about their culture, the Lucitanians and Ender have experiences similar to Juna in the Color of Distance, and her struggles to fathom the Tendu.  Definitely an A+ read!
B00000G3PA|1.0|I skipped this one in the theaters, not on purpose, but because of Bruce Willis. I have never liked any of his movies.<br />So, in one night, I watched this one and Deep Impact. I enjoyed Deep Impact because it was more about how we as humans, prepare for the &quot;end.&quot;<br />Armageddon on a whole is simply terrible. Everything feels artificial and forced. Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love ... . Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth. All of the emotion in this film was so staged and fake, that it was hard to feel for these characters. I have to wonder about people who said they cried when watching this film. I also never felt a sense of doom like I did when watching movies like Independence Day or Deep Impact.<br />Maybe I was in a bad mood when I watched this. Maybe this was simply a bad movie. One thing for sure, I wont watch it again.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Another talentless, production session of screaming &quot;lyrics&quot; from the angst-filled members of Limp Bizkit.  One can only wonder how those so young and untravelled managed to become so enraged and manic.  Or how a few years of real issues such as taxes, children, mortgages, et al might impact the hostility of this &quot;music.&quot;<br />Normally, I would ignore such hackish attempts if there wasn't the incessant hourly air play this crap seems to garner.  I'm amazed that my fellow man and local program directors are placated by this trash.  Rise up fools!  Rebel!  Demand that talent accompany your rage session.
6305350205|2.0|Star Trek V has taken a lot of heat. Sure, it may be the weakest entry in the series, but when watched with an open mind and in the widescreen version, it isn't too bad. I think William Shatner did a good job in his direction; it was the script that was sub par. I enjoyed watching the characters and the story wasn't too bad until the ending came, which I will get to later. As bad as it was, it was just so darn watchable.<br />The main problems I had was the out of place comedy and the characters actions. The comedy seemed forced instead of natural. Take the scene where Sulu and Chekov were lost and Chekov blows into the communicator to simulate a blizzard. That wasn't funny! It was a scene put in the movie to make you think it was funny. It should have been natural, like Kirk saying he needed a shower and Spock saying &quot;Yes.&quot; Also, why was poor Scotty fixing the ship during  the entire movie? That is all he did!<br />The ending was terrible. I agree with the line that said &quot;Look for God within yourself,&quot; but a cocktail party with the Klingons? And then in the next movie, they said they have &quot;never been this close&quot; to a Klingon ship!<br />All in all, it is watchable and contains good direction, but &quot;dumbs&quot; itself down in the end. I give Star Trek V a C-.
B00000FZJL|5.0|the only one in the series that is truly worth biuying. Why else do you think it spawned so many sequels? It is really funny and really original (if you forget about the sequals) this is one of the best guttneburg is really funny. Stick w/ this one and forget the others well, maybe not 2
6305232660|4.0|I found Deep Impact to be a very good &quot;study&quot; on how we has humans, may react to an E.L.E. (see this movie for details on that.) The special effects were good, but the best thing about this movie was the focus on the characters. This wasn't loud and stupid as &quot;that other asteroid movie.&quot; This film will entertain you and mostly, touch your heart. You actually feel the doom that is about to reach these people, and to me, that is good film making.<br />About the only thing I could pick on would be the performance of T&eacute;a Leoni. To me, she was never convincing. She seemed down and depressed all of the time, even when she was doing the news. Very odd performance.<br />On a whole, this film delivers.

B000000OPU|5.0|this was an album that began my conversion from heavy metal to a more diverse musical palette. it still stands up, 15 years (?!) after its release because of the sheer beauty of the songs. today's audience might not understand what red rain is about or why it's here, but we still lived in a nuclear world back then. sledgehammer is a funny song whose funk is kept loose and sprighty thanx 2 a limber rhythm section; a funny song and an amazing video still. don't give up brings tears 2 me eyes, especially kate bush's vocal. in your eyes-what female doesn't like this song? mercy street-one of my favorites-moody, ethereal, spooky; like a thick fog cast down on a london street. i recently looked at the instrumentation credits and noticed that a lot of african instrumentation is used quite a bit. my friends in high school always thought this was 2 slow; u just gotta recognize the beauty. i bet he's amazing 2 see live.
0345409671|4.0|The story line was rather clever.  Lestat is inticed by Memnoch (the Devil).  But what the Devil wants is totally unexpected.  He wants to set the story straight about God.  Memnoch is apparently trying to save people from being bitter toward God!  He explains that only souls who have forgiven God can go to Heaven and that is what Hell is for...  <br />Of course the reader is constantly wondering if this is just a lie or the real thing.  So much of what we believe is riding on whether or not Memnoch was telling the truth...
B00003CXMG|2.0|The only character even remotely interesting was &quot;Lester Bangs&quot;.  This movie was an overfluffed self-indulgent ego trip, no one could be such a perfect child/adolescent as Cameron Crowe was supposed to be.  The movie was 100% predictable and contrived.  The story line was an assault on my intelligence, and the characters were totally uninspiring.  Maybe this stuff seemed more interesting to everyone in 70's when they were stoned, I remember these types of people as directionless buffoons (I was ~10 at the time the movie took place).  And now I am certain that with this kind of sentimental crap, the birth of Punk Rock was an inevitability.  The movie did have excellent: acting, cinematography and costumes/sets, however I get really irritated when a movie is used as someones self-glorifying ego-trip.  Unless you are were a teenager or a 20-something in the 70's you will probably hate this.
0525945636|1.0|I have read all of Ken Follett's books and he is one of my favorite authors. NO WAY could the author who wrote &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; be the same author who wrote &quot;Code to Zero!&quot;  So, I think it must be one of two possible explanations.  1) Ken Follett ran afoul of the CIA and suffered the same fate as &quot;Luke&quot;.....he woke up one morning and couldn't remember anything, including how to write. Or 2) A high school student wrote the book and Ken signed his name.  Considering the absurdity of the entire plot involving the memory loss, I would conclude the latter.  Along with the inaccuracies, the characters and the plot are absurd and simplistic.  A child could have predicted the outcome. Please, Mr. Follett, make your next book worthy of YOU!
0780018664|3.0|In 1933 the Nazis offered Fritz Lang the leadership of the German film industry. Being half-Jewish and a liberal he refused and fled to America. His wife, Thea von Harbou (who would become an ardent Nazi) wrote the well-crafted script for &quot;M&quot;, a 1930 film about a child murderer and his tormented mind. This film is eerily steeped in the German expressionist tradition so prevalent during the Weimar period with its gloom and horror and the hairsplitting explorations of the darkest sides of the human soul. But where &quot;Caligari&quot; (1918), the trendsetter, was horror within the ambiguous realm of reality and fantasy, &quot;M&quot; is a real crime story with a thought-provoking end. However, this film is clearly a statement of the crisis of German society at the brink of the ultimate horror of war. The theme music of Grieg's &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; melody nicely ties this masterfully edited film together (Lang used Griffith's montage methods).

B00000612P|5.0|In 1971, Rod Stewart released &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot; AND a Faces LP, AND toured solo AND toured with the Faces.  He was only 20 months removed from the Jeff Beck Group, where he sang on two classic LPs.  He was IT in he summer of '71.<br />So...what happened?<br />Well--read the other reviews.  You'll see Rod was trendy, not a trend setter.  As much as I loved what he did from 1968-1975, I simply can't bear to here any of his newer work, ESPECIALLY his attempts over the last five years to recapture his glory by rehashing his classics.<br />That said, &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story,&quot; along with &quot;Never A Dull Moment,&quot; his work with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces, particularly on &quot;A Nods As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse,&quot; are fantastic.<br />The overlooked link here is Ronnie Wood, who played on so many early Rod efforts, was the Keith Richard equivalent in the Faces, and even played bass and some second guitar on the Beck records.  Wood was a master at getting a lot out of a little--he plays acoustic lead on rockers, dobro on &quot;That's All Right,&quot;, ukes, even some banjo.  The classical intro to &quot;Maggie May,&quot; often clipped by DJs, is, well, classic.  The Stones seem to have imasculated this great rock guitar player after &quot;Some Girls&quot;....the guts of this band--Mick Waller, Pete Sears, Ian McLagan--can be found all over the best of British rock from the era: Faces, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, and more.<br />I've heard &quot;Maggie May,&quot; I dunno, maybe 15,000 times in my life, and it stays great.  It may be a weight around Rod Stewart's neck by now, but it is a piece of perfection that will be around long after &quot;Tonight's The Night,&quot; &quot;Young Turks,&quot; and &quot;Hot Legs&quot; are forgotten.  <br />While I love the cool guitar intro to &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You&quot; (Ronnie Wood again), my favorite moment on this LP comes 3 minutes into the title track, when Rod and MaggieBell jump a note to sing &quot;She claimed that it just ain't natural,&quot; and then, 4-1/2 minutes in, when the bass drops, Ronnie kicks in the rhythm guitar, and Maggie and Rod become insistant: &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story--Don't It?&quot;<br />This is a great LP, made at a time when Rod knew how to work Rock, Soul, R&amp;B, Country and British Folk together into his own unique blend.  Forget virtually every note he played after &quot;Atlantic Crossing,&quot; but don't write him off completely.  <br />Because in the summer of '71, he was IT.
0064409422|5.0|This is the original BOOK ONE of the Chronicles of Narnia which introduces us to four siblings, Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy, all of whom are living in an old house with many rooms, one of which contains no other furniture except an old wardrobe. Lucy is the first to discover that the wardrobe is more than just an ordinary piece of furniture, and from there the adventure takes off to a faraway land known simply as Narnia. This is a story of how Good conquers Evil (in a most unusual and imaginative way!)and of how four children discover that they are more than just children.<br />I am still trying to figure out why this is listed as the SECOND book of the series when the copy I read lists it as the FIRST in the series, and rightfully so in my humble opinion. This particular title beautifully introduces the characters and sets the entire tone for the whole lot. C.S. Lewis has a poetic style of writing that dispenses quite a bit of information without losing the rhythm of the story. Truly a marvelous and engrossing tale.<br />Follow the original order and read this one first.<br />Enjoy.
B000002J09|5.0|Jimmy Page, as a Producer of 1970s metal, was simply invincible.  This album is as close to a perfect metal record as you will ever hear.<br />From the opening scratches of Page's Les Paul strings, through the soaring &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; (with a personal favorite of mine, Sandy Denny, on vocals) and the thundering &quot;When The Levee Breaks,&quot; this is a creative and sonic masterpiece, the likes of which wanna-be's like Kiss, Motley Crue, and a thousand others have never even vaguely approached.<br />There is, of course, &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; which 1970s and '80s FM radio did its very best to kill by playing it 8 times an hour for 20 years straight.  Trouble is it's so damn good--true delicacy on the acoustic intro, true throbbing rock in the middle, and true artistry, intensity and vision on the guitar solo--that it lives on.<br />I once read that Jimmy Page said somewhere he wrote the complex &quot;Black Dog,&quot; and then overdubbed so many guitars on its recording, specifically because he was sick and tired of hearing every bar band in the world do lousy versions of Led Zep songs from their first 3 LPs, so he tried to create a record that second rate bands couldn't cover.<br />It worked. Nobody can touch this LP--including Page, who could never recreate the beauty of the &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; guitar solo on stage.
0440219078|4.0|I feel this book is great for older people. I really like this book.  It pulls you in to it.
0792835077|4.0|Okay, so the premise of this film is deeply flawed. This is the flaw: there is no reason for the robots to have bullets in their guns! That is why I give this 4 instead of 5 stars. But I'm willing to overlook that flaw to enjoy what is a great sci fi thriller. Michael Crichton directed this film and the great thriller COMA. He's a better director than most full time directors. Let's hope he gets behind the camera again soon.
0812589041|5.0|Some nights after a rough day in junior high, I would just pull this battered paperback off my shelf and read it cover-to-cover again in one sitting.  It's one of those few great books that combines wisdom, action, and real depth, but is immediately accessible to young people (I first read it in 4th grade).   If you have a nephew, cousin, or son (boys seem to relate to the book much better than girls do), particularly one who takes lots of those &quot;gifted&quot; classes, this may very well be the perfect birthday present...
0345347951|5.0|First off, let me say that if you are reading these reviews for the purpose of trying to decide to read this book, don't read any reviews that are written by anyone from Hoopeston, IL because their class was forced to read this book and I don't think you should write a review if you were forced to read it. This book is the best science fiction I have ever read, but if you've never read science fiction don't start with this because it may be to deep for you. This is a book that definetly makes you think about things. It's a good well written story that is definetly worthy of being called a classic. When reading you're always wondering what this weird story is leading to because it seems like it isn't leading to anything, that it's just a bunch of writing without purpose. It isn't! I won't say anything at all about the ending except you won't expect it at all. I guess my main point is if the book seems boring, which it definetly might, don't stop reading it because of that. The ending is the best I've ever read and well worth the time!

B00004XONN|3.0|I realy love OK Computer, i think it's one of the greatest things done in the nineties along with NIN's work, and i wasn't expecting something in particular since Radiohead moved really fast with each album. I didn't like this the first time i heard it, i remember thinking of it as something Brian Eno or Aphex Twin could do better, but after listening carefully to &quot;How To Dissapear Completely&quot; i gave a sense of my own to Kid A. I don't love it more than OK Computer, but i really think it is necessary and it gives us something really different that this great musicians can do with their talents. I know that every artist has to move in another direction with every piece of work they do and in this case it resulted in a very eclectic piece of art, this is a fine example.

0345440757|5.0|My husband and I attended &quot;Prep For Parenting&quot; classes, which gave us a good foundation for raising our now nine month old daughter.  This book utilizes many of the same principles that has helped us with understanding the needs of our baby.  I feel the most important point made in this book is the issue of &quot;listening&quot; to your baby.  From day one, &quot;listening&quot; has helped to keep me clued in to my baby and diminished the stress and potential chaos that could occur.  My baby is happy and healthy and so are we!
B000009CEM|2.0|I was really disappointed when this album was released in 1998, and I'm sad to say that it hasn't stood the test of time well.  It's not that this is a particularly bad album it's just that this is such a half hearted rehash of Fear Factory's previous album, the classic Demanufacture.  A couple of tracks stand out, notably, `edgecrusher' and `shock',that are classic extreme metal cuts. The trance like `descent' is the most commercial song the band have ever written (and strangely, never even considered as a single) and is also very good.  `Smasher/devourer', `hi tech hate' and `obsolete' are examples of the weaker tracks, although they are not technically bad, they are just a case of Fear Factory-by-numbers and if you've heard Demanufacture then you've heard this style of song been done better before.  `Resurrection' and `timelessness' are, in my opinion, atrocious and sound like a bad version of 80's metal, coming across like a combination of Manowar and Spinal Tap.  Whoever thought of releasing `resurrection' as a single, should be fired immediately.<br />If you are new to Fear Factory, then you will probably love this album, but if like me, you have followed the band from the early days and seen how the band have progressed from their debut album `soul of a new machine' to their landmark release `Demanufacture', then I can guarantee you will feel at least a hint of disappointment.
B0000087QO|5.0|I love punk and always fond of Blondie. This is quintessential Blondie. A must buy for any retrospective of great 80's music. Fun and irreverent, mildly innovative given the time it was made. I just like Debby Harry's (sp?)voice. Keep me hangin on the telephone brings back alot of good memories from law school days
B000002OYB|4.0|Considering that I've spent the past several years listening to the absolute intensity of &quot;Bat Out of Hell II&quot;, this CD didn't quite blow me away.  However, I soon realized how great it was when I compared it to most everything else that's done by everyone else other than Meat Loaf.  This CD is a prime example of material you listen to all day, and also stuff you'll always skip over after only listening to it twice (if more than once).  To elaborate what exacly I mean, I'll have to break this CD down fully.  Hell, there's only 12 tracks.<br />The songs &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Where Angels Sing&quot; are examples that you only listen to a couple of times and never again.  While not generally bad, they just don't seem to deliver enough emotion, nor do they seem to try to emit the emotion that we listeners want to feel.  We listen to Meat Loaf whenever we want to feel the power of love, or strong portrayals of lust, frustration or sadness; we just don't like Meat Loaf singing about sentimentality very much.  However, &quot;Fiesta De Las Almas Perdidas&quot; and &quot;45 Seconds of Ecstasy&quot; are the examples of songs you only hear once in your life simply because they are awful songs.  You can tell that they would be considering Meat Loaf isn't in either one.<br />Going up a decent notch are the few examples of songs that are neither awful or great.  They're IMO &quot;Original Sin&quot; and &quot;Amnesty is Granted&quot;.  I listen to those songs occasionally, for they are quite decent songs, but both deliver a nice amount of emotion and leave the listener pleading for more.  &quot;Original Sin&quot; is a really heavily done song, just stangely not done quite right; maybe because the metaphor that Steinman was stating was unclear.  And what's the big problem with &quot;Amnesty is Granted&quot; is that it opens with THE MOST INCREDIBLE guitar riff ever, but the rest of the song is quite lacking in comparison.  Another that seems to fit in the middle would be &quot;Running for the Red Light&quot;, but I feel that it's because it's a totally loose style, totally void of heavy emotion, but is still fun to listen to.<br />&quot;Left In the Dark&quot; is a nice song, full of emotion, and clever lyrics.  Like in the old &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; song, you mainly hear the same lyrics a couple of times, but unlike the old Meat Loaf classic, no new lyrics come in later, and you notice the second time that the lyrics are the exact same.  At least the music increases in intensity beautifully, but that's the main reason for liking this song.  &quot;Not a Dry Eye&quot; and &quot;Where the Rubber Meets the Road&quot; are another notch up in the right direction, and always cool to listen to.  Both feature the right amounts and portrayal styles of emotion.<br />However, &quot;If This is the Last Kiss&quot; and &quot;I'd Lie for You and That's the Truth&quot; really steal the show.  The only problems with them is that &quot;If This Is Our Last Kiss&quot; is that it is less than five minutes, and &quot;I'd Lie for You and That's the Truth&quot; is a bit ackward because Meat Loaf generally portrays love as a very painful thing of heartbreak, but here it's righteous praise.<br />However, maybe this did take a long time, but at least I think I covered it well.  If you want another mind blowing thing from Meat Loaf, this isn't quite it, but if you just want nic amounts of emotion and rock music, look no further.
0060196122|5.0|When I think about this book it reminds me of one of those delightful reading experiences, where part of you doesn't want the book to end, yet another part wants to see what else can happen upon turning the next page.<br /> Coelho has the gift that characterizes those writers who capture you and don't let you go.<br /> I've read four of his books already: 'The Alchemist', 'The Pilgrim', this one and, more recently (not yet released in English), his most recent one: 'The demon and Miss Prym'. Out of them, without any doubt I put this one as my favorite, followed by a tied second place between 'The demon...' and 'The Pilgrim'.<br /> Why? Because in this book I feel he achieved the pinnacle as a novelist. His book is so realistic, believable, filled with such emotion, such spirit.<br /> I highly recommend it. If I could give it six stars, I'd do it with eyes closed. Although I should be careful to say that I read it in Spanish, and I don't know how good is the version translated to English.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I don't quite understand why Rein Raus does'nt appeal to many fans, because it is a real catchy tune. Mein Herz Brennt ought to be their next single. It's just that damn good. Feuer Frei was also another &quot;not so popular&quot; song, and I don't understand why. When I'm driving with my radio blasting, if I'm not blasting out Mein herz brennt, I'm playing Feuer Frei! Who cares if you cannot understand what they are saying? If you want to know that bad, visit one of their many fan pages. Out.
B0000027DJ|4.0|Often, it seems that past generations give a wonderful contribution to the world, and later generations try to make cheap copies of what our elders have already done. I never found a modern writer that comes close to writers like Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, or Charles Dickens. (And I'm an English Major!) Now Cooper gave us a really different kind of music. He was creative; he organized his music well; and he provided us with an unusual form of entertainment. (Probably the writer John Webster would have loved it!) With some exceptions, it seems that most people these days have tried to copy Cooper's  ideas without putting the same effort in that Cooper did. All of that aside, this is a wonderful record that gives us some energetic music, some sad music, some scarey music, and even some happy music. Despite the different types of music on this record, it flows wonderfully. Even if you don't really care for Cooper, you should buy this record. It is a piece of history.

B00000HZFH|5.0|I recently borrowed this CD from a friend and It's awesome. At first listen it doesnt really strike you, it just seems to be above average and kind of catchy. However after repeated listenings the truth begins to emerge--this album is absolutely amazing. The guitar work is superb, dense and emotional and the core of the album. This is not to say thatit overshadows the rest of the elements of the band, eeven the lengthy solos manage to retain a sense of understatement. The lyrics are also great and manage to convey alot of emotion. Bottom line this album is tremendous.
0783240236|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a movie.  This is true despite his not having the high tech at his disposal that today's filmmakers have for making a film that needs all of these  attacking birds' sequences.  What he used instead was his imagination and also the best collaborators in the business for every aspect of the film.  Most importantly, he did not get so lost with the wonder of his special effects that he forgot that his prime job was to make a movie that worked.  This was my primary thought upon finishing this excellent movie and comparing it to all of these dismal action adventure yarns of today which have little to recommend them besides their state of the art special effects.  Hitchcock gives us a small coastal town in northern California that a socialite, Melanie (Tippi Hendren), visits for a few days to follow up a chance meeting she had back in San Francisco with local resident Mitch (Rod Taylor).  This romantic interest is soon eclipsed by a much bigger event that begins shortly after Melanie's arrival, when a seagull attacks her hairdo (the nest like French Twist fittingly enough).<br /><br />The bird attacks on the populace begin shortly after this and consistently escalate in the number of birds involved.  Hitchcock used a combination of real and machine made birds for his bird cast, even employing a bird wrangler for handling the real ones. Hitchcock never deals with why the birds are attacking.  He simply develops the possibility that it could happen and how powerless we'd be if it did.  So meticulous was he in staging his sequences that after a solid week of being attacked by birds in the house's attic, Tippi Hendren had to be hospitalized for exhaustion she was such a wreck.  In the \\"making of\\" film that is also in the DVD, you learn the incredible preparation Hitchcock did for every single aspect of this film, including the drawing of it from start to finish on storyboards.  He didn't zero in on just one aspect of making a film but concerned himself with every single detail of it.  Rod Taylor and Tippi Hendren had the roles of their careers here.  They are not Jimmy Stewart or Grace Kelly, used previously by Hitch, but in Hitch's hands they are up to the task of this very unsettling film.

B000000OQF|5.0|I know that is a big title to back up,  maybe I couldn't even convince you, but I really think this is one of the best Rock albums of all time. By the time your into the middle of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; you know your not listening to another copycat band of that time. When I first heard this album back in 1987 I thought to myself, &quot;Now this is what Rock N Roll is supposed to be&quot; and I still think that 14 years later. The album has such energy, anger, sleaze, and street in it, it's impossible not to feel yourself. &quot;It's so easy&quot; is dark, gloomy, harsh, and was a little shocking to hear the first time (Hardly shocking these days). &quot;Nighttrain&quot; will make you want to pull up a bottle of Jack between your legs and turn up the stereo full tilt. &quot;Sweet Child O'mine&quot; was a radio hit, and Slash's guitar in that song still makes me punch the gas if I'm in the car. Mix two parts drug paranoia ,one part Angry Axl, then sprinkle some self absorption and you have, &quot;Out to get me&quot; my favorite overall. Don't be suprised if your giving someone the finger by the end of this song. Rock n Roll at it's best, and I'm still waiting for someone to top it.
B000050IMG|5.0|When I first heard about this movie I could hardly wait to see it. When it finally came out I was so excited &amp; went to see it in theatres on the opening night. This movie is a hilarous movie that makes fun of Modern Horror movies like: Scream, The Exorcist, I Know What you Did Last Summer &amp; Friday the 13th. It also makes fun of comedies and non-horror movies like: American Pie, The Matrix, &amp; River Dance. So I really enjoyed this movie and will give it a 5. 5 stars out of 5. I suggest you go out and buy this movie as soon as possiblr. I bought it the first day it came out to own on video. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
B000001FKY|5.0|I've had acquaintances laugh at me for listening to Def Leppard in my car or at home. I think what many people don't know, or don't remember are how big these guys were in the 80's. Hysteria is an incredible must own album that is so much fun. I'd probably say that &quot;Women&quot; was my favorite song, but radio hits like &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot; will have your neighbors asking you to keep it down. The title track &quot;Hysteria&quot; is a warm and catchy song. To lump these guys in as another &quot;80's Hair Band&quot; would be an insult.
B00000JCB2|5.0|this cd rules because all songs except &quot;dont go off wandering&quot; and &quot;show me what you got&quot; and &quot;lesson learned&quot; it is a great cd but my favs are &quot;break stuff&quot; rearranged &quot;i'm broke&quot; &quot;nookie&quot; and &quot;nobodylike you&quot; so please buy this cd if you know what is good music
B000003TA4|5.0|Ok, several months ago I read some of the reviews on this very board, because i couldn't decide whether or not to buy &quot;Nevermind&quot;. I eventually decided to get it, and after i did, i listened to it nonstop for a few weeks. It is now-by far my favorite album. Nothing tops it. Nirvana is truly the best band of the 90's and one of the greatest bands of all time. Whether or not you like Nirvana, hate Nirvana, or have no opinion of them at all, this cd should be in your collection. its a  must have. And, if you get it and dont like it at first, listen to it. again and again. you will grow to like it i guarantee.
B00004XOWM|5.0|wow this cd os awsome buy this cd all the songs except &quot;the one&quot; are phat man please buy this cd if you think fred durst is cool and your a BIG fan  of l.b. you will love it like i do
B000050XEI|2.0|I love Enya's music, but it seems she has every cd with the same formation.  Every cd has an instrumental, every cd starts with her ethereal voices and every cd has one song in Gaelic.  It's as if you know what she'll do on every cd, it lacks real surprises.  She needs to loosen up a little bit and add some new stuff.  It's okay when its 2 or 3 cd's, does it have to be on every one of them.  Enya seek more influences!
0345440757|4.0|I got this book when my baby was three months old.  I had been using Dr. Sears' Baby Book previously.  I thought I couldn't let my baby fall asleep by herself and that she couldn't cry without me there.  So at three months old, my baby was being rocked to sleep at night and taking 1 to 3 hours (with her crying) to do it.  I was at my wit's end.  But with the Baby Whisperer's advice,  I started teaching her to fall asleep in her crib.  I never let her &quot;cry it out,&quot; and within days of starting she was falling asleep in 30 minutes.  Now at 5 months old, she falls asleep in her bed.  She is much happier this way and so am I.  It took a bit longer than Tracy Hogg's 3-day magic, but I'm not complaining.<br />I am very happy with Tracy Hogg's advice about baby's sleeping.  Most of what she says seems very middle-of-the-road, not at one extreme (Ferberizing) or the other (Sears).  Of course, I don't agree with everything in the book, but I combine it with some of Dr. Sears and a lot of my own opinion.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This is a spectacular movie. Hanks carried the movie for a full 45 minutes or so by himself. Who else can make you get emotionally attached to a volleyball, it became human. I would have actually liked more time spent on the island than there was. The way he gets to the island is pretty freaky. Don't see this movie before you catch a flight somewhere.
0060273224|5.0|SABRIEL was an absolutely incredible story.  I was looking for something to satisfy my Harry Potter craving for a while, lol, and I thought that it looked interesting.  After about the first 20 pages or so, however, I couldn't put it down!  :0) (Which was bad, because I had a looooot of homework to do.)<br />Anyway, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, romance, or mystery, because it will satisfy all your cravings!  :0)
B00004ZESV|5.0|I've owned for years a VHS featuring part of this same concert, that I actually attended at the Zenith Concert Hall, 16 years ago. On this DVD, you can find nearly all the show that was dispatched during the Leisure Tour, without question the most explosive and creative tour Kid Creole ever made. This represents nearly 90 minutes, whereas the video only featured approx. 60 minutes of the show. The director of this video made a very good job, in re-creating the atmosphere of the concert that occured that day (the Zenith Concert Hall can hold between 4,000 and 6,000  people, according to seats configuration; and it was packed and very hot on that evening !) The picture quality is very good (better than on the video) and the sound quality, despite whatever has been said, is very good too (better than on the Hi-Fi Stereo VHS release, even though it is far from the level of some recent 5.1 productions). But this would still be a terrific show to see even with a bad sound and picture. Kid Creole means a lot of fun, energy, exceptional musicians (ah that horns section !)and some very original and perfectly synchronized choreography ! Don't hesitate and go for the buy, especially at that low price !
B00004YRQA|5.0|I bought this card imidietly when i got my ps2. its great i have 12 games saved on it and a 1 mb replay and it still has plenty oh space. i has very fast load save times and has never lost any info of mine. i love it. <br />BUt i think im going to get the mad catz one for my next card because its sony certified ... it also looks cooler but this one is great if u dont want to risk a 3rd party mem card
0783229526|4.0|The book: Splendid.  The movie: Equally splendid.  I enjoyed this movie front to end, thanks to the convincing performances given my Depp and Del Toro.  Die-hard gonzo fans will definitely find this film almost parallel to that of the book.  I wouldn't recommend it to the faint-of-heart, considering the incessant drug usage and vomiting, but for those with stronger stomachs and a liking for fast-paced, drug-induced, slapstick insanity, this one's a keeper!
B000059ZT4|4.0|Like other reviews here, I too wish this Deluxe Set had something &quot;extra&quot; for fans to chew on, like demos, outttakes, or anything totally new.<br />But that feeling dissapears after checking out the unreleased, original Jamaican version. I was expecting a rougher, denser, unmastered version of the album, but was shocked to hear a clean, clear, and joyous mix that in my mind blows the Island version away. It has more spirit, sounds looser, and is much better mix than the one I already thought was a masterwork.<br />I never noticed it in the original Island version, but the sound is notably softer, more subdued, with far less energy. Plus, tthere are a number of overdubbed instruments in the Island version, which just seem uneccessary. Case in point, play &quot;400 Years&quot; from both discs back to back. The overdubbed organ in the Island version swallows Peter Tosh's voice, while in the Jamaican version Tosh is in command. Bold, and straight up.<br />So if you already have the original version, you have to hear the Jamaican release. In my mind, THIS is how it was supposed to be.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I don't recall this movie being released in Australian cinemas, so seeing it on DVD was a first for me.  I'm fast becoming a big Sandra Bullock fan because she is as comfortable with drama as she is with comedy.  It's rare that I get to have a good laugh during a movie AND shed a tear (or three!)  This is a really enjoyable movie, shot at some beautiful loactions with a nice soundtrack as well.  Highly recommended.
0789723107|4.0|As a web designer, sometimes I find myself assuming my websites are user freindly.  Well, we all know what assuming gets you.<br />Most of the information is common sense.

B0000009TK|5.0|Some band. This is not the usual heavy rock arrangements, it's more jazzy, like it says on the cover. So Black napkins is dealt with in the style of zappa in new york, with trumpet/sax..you have big swifty and king kong. Loads of sampling on these and when yuppies go to hell. great guitar on fire and chains and star wars won't work. Beautiful black page and guitar solo. Dupree's paradise, strictly genteel,alien orifice...great instrumentals. Also a couple of songs, stevie's spanking, city of tiny lights, advance romance, cruising for burgers. But mostly instrumental. It's great to here the other band members get a chance to solo too.
1563896656|5.0|Alan Moore's graphic novels (the Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and his  tenures as writer of Miracleman/Marvelman and Swamp Thing) are among the most critically acclaimed dramas appearing in comics in the last 30 years.<br />Moore's more recent creator-owned work, the DC Wildstorm &quot;America's Best Comics&quot; Line is simply great fun, and for my money, &quot;the League, 1898&quot; is the best of the lot (Top 10, coming in second):  The League is an adventure for the literate, a romp for the well read - there hasnt been anything quite like it since Mike Baron and Steve Rude's creator-owned &quot;Nexus&quot; came out in the 1980's (Nexus is also well worth looking up and collecting).<br />Kevin O'Neils (ABC Warriours for the Fleetway UK's 2000 AD) work here is wonderful, a great pleasure to peruse, and the colourist, Benedict Digmagmaliv (sp?) deserves special mention for his bold protrayal of the look of warm yellow ncadescent light at this, the beginning of the high industrial era.
0440219078|4.0|This is a very Grand Book.  One of the best Books I have ever read.  There are a few books that I have ever read that are better.  Its about a boy who grows up in a perfet world, or a not so perfect world.  It made me think about life and what really is a perfect world.  Its suprsing to find out what &quot;...&quot; is.  Sorry can't tell you the word.  Thats another reason for you to read this book.
B000051VWW|3.0|Okay, I've given myself several months to warm up to this cd and it's not really happening.  Hard and uneasy best describes the feeling of this Sade release.  It's almost as if Sade wanted to create a cd that would take years to grow on people, and I think many people are kidding themselves when they say this is her best.  If this had been her first cd, it would have not made a very favorable impression on me.  What happened to the rhythm?  What happened to the flow?  What happened to that smooooth Sade sound?  All of it pretty much abandoned on &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.  Three stars is a bit generous.
6305622930|5.0|1970 hit movie and Best Picture academy award winner about General George S. Patton Jr. in World War II.  George C. Scott, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous general, portrays Patton from his entry into the war with II Armor Corps in North Africa to victory in Europe with the 3d Army.  Patton's triumphs and controversial incidents are covered in this feature and provide entertaining insight on this man whose name is almost synonymous with World War II.  While Patton rests in the elite ranks of other famous leaders, his flamboyant personality sets him apart from most and it is Scott's impressive capture of this that makes the movie shine. <br />The movie is generally accurate.  Patton is credited with taking command of the II Armor Corps at a critical time just after a brutal defeat to the German Army in North Africa, and leading it to victory shortly afterward.  Patton advances to command of the VII Army and is successful in Sicily.  During the Sicily operation, Patton slaps a soldier in a field hospital for perceived malingering, resulting in his relief from command.  Eventually he's reinstated to command of the 3d Army in France and leads the breakout from Normandy when Allied forces were bogged down in the infamous hedgerows.  The most famous event occurs when he anticipates the German's Ardennes Counter-offensive, more famously known as the \\"Battle of the Bulge,\\" and miraculously turns the 3d Army north in little time to defeat the Germans. <br />There's artistic overplay of some historical details for dramatic effect such as being portrayed as almost running operations by himself when in fact he had talented staff and commanders who advised him well and carried out his orders.  A very interesting scene for speculation is after his fuel supplies have been redirected in 1944 to the invasion of the Netherlands [portrayed in the 1976 feature \\"A Bridge Too Far\\"] he is standing on the scorched earth of a recent tank battle and remarks to his aide that he could be in Berlin in ten days.   <br />Overall an epic picture and one of a kind.  Other projects have attempted to follow this formula, but none came close to what was achieved in this movie.  Picture quality and sound are excellent and it's well worth adding to your personal DVD collection.

6301247485|2.0|After reading The Great Gatsby for my American Literature class, I decided to watch the movie, just to see how well it stuck to the plot and theme. I was highly disappointed. Sam Waterston as Nick somewhat impressed me, and Robert Redford was wonderfully mediocre as Gatsby, but the rest of the film appalled me. Mia Farrow's voice is most certainly not &quot;full of money&quot;, and I firmly believe that Fitzgerald intended Daisy to be much more intelligent than Farrow portrayed her. The green glow at the end of Daisy's dock lost so much when it became a small, flashing light that could barely be seen across the bay in the film. The ending of the book was somber and moving; the ending of the movie, with a myriad of flappers dancing to &quot;Ain't We Got Fun&quot; was, for lack of a better word, cheesy. Fitzgerald's Myrtle Wilson was, to me, dignified and even somewhat timid. She was not a &quot;wild child&quot;, as the film paints her. Overall, I am extremely glad that I read the novel before watching the movie, because this version of the film destroyed a great American novel.
B00003CXB2|4.0|Macintosh users should know that the DVD-ROM features on this disk are not usable on their computers -- not even if they are running PC emulation with Virtual PC. I find this an egregious flaw in an otherwise splendid DVD.
B000021Y74|5.0|Unlike most of the other reviewers here, I do not feel the need to regurgitate all the details of this film.  Suffice it to say, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is number one on my list of recommendations!  I usually opt for the extremes: pointless no-brainer movies as a means of relaxing and trying to forget about my hectic college schedule, or profound films which require me to keep my brain locked in the &quot;on&quot; position.  &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is both--it is possible to zone out with the European techno soundtrack, but it is also a film which (if you actually pay attention to it) allows you to explore the subtle clues hidden throughout, which reveal the film's weighty, philosophical themes.  I highly recommend you see this film.  You may not enjoy it as much as many other people do, but at least give it a shot and find out for yourself!
0553573403|2.0|Yes, I am aware that Robert Jorden needs to get his act together but at least he dosen't have to resort to characters with a vocabulary limited to four letter words.  I was disapointed to find that every other word in this series was a cuss word.  I think a real writer can develop his character's thought and feelings without using bad words.  For example, Robert Jorden uses almost no foul language or explict sexual situations in the 'Wheel of Time' series.  For those of you who like a good clean book, stay away from George R.R. Martin.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This movie was absolutely wonderful, they took a huge problem and broke it down from one thing to another, with a beautiful script and wonderful acting traffic really is a great movie.  I don't see how it could be boring, it was the most original film I've seen in a long time, it's about time someone did somthing original in hollywood, this is a classic never to be forgotten

B00000F1D3|3.0|Cher has made her huge comeback, this was back in 1998 when Believe hit the airwaves, and soon everyone knew what song that was. Following suit to Madonna, Gloria Estefan and others who all had dance albums out that year before Cher, she has created one which is alike yet very original and unique. Believe is a club experience. There is some strong material here, key tracks including Runaway, We All Sleep Alone and All Or Nothing, which is the standout of the album. Other songs are good, but some are more bside like such as The Power or Taxi Taxi, which sounded like they were better suited as bsides to the singles of the album. Nevertheless this is a nice album, but by far not her best album.
B00004SQSQ|5.0|SONIC BREW was my first ahhhhh ZAKK fix I had so of course this is the most special cd ever.  <br />ALL the songs on this cd is awesome ZAKK WYLDE you are WILD!

079073463X|4.0|I love this movie!!!!!!! :) the DVD version is good because the night scenes in the video version of the movie, you really can't see what's happinging in the ngiht, and the dialogue is kind of hard to hear in the video version , but the DVD version has the subtitles to look at. This movie is a total tearjerker...I gave this movie a 4 out of 5 because the music in the movie was kind of annoying..but overall if you can get over the music and watch the movie..you will love it!! :)
014028009X|4.0|Set in london, modern time Helen Fielding's novel Bridget Jone's Diary is very enjoyable, and easily realatable. Bridget Jone's quest for self-improvement and her imperfections will bring a smile to your face, when you realize yourself doing the same things. The novel is brilliantly funny, while we read about one year of bridget's life, in this fast paced novel. Fielding truly captures something real in bridget, that many other character don't posses, and that is Bridget's true nature and how she seems so real.
B000002UB3|5.0|i am at once fascinated and revulsed by the chaps who break this cd down song by song, note by note.  this is the beatles!  this album was an epiphany for its time, and continues to baffle and intrigue to this day.  i know not everyone is a fanatic, but i think if people would allow themselves to come at this disc from a fresh perspective, they'd be blown away as i have.  abbey road is art, and as a whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.
B000002V1D|5.0|In an age of artistic ambiguity, there are some works which are refreshingly satisfying to those with a specific taste. I first bought this album when it was released several years ago, and I gave it another look recently. This record has production such as is not often seen anymore. Regardless of your perceived image of this particular band, one must look far to find any recent release which is as well written, performed, and mixed as this one. This record would be just as good whether it was released in 1983, 1993, or 2003.
B000059PPX|5.0|I first saw this film about 20 years ago on some pay channel, and have been waiting to see it again ever since.  Okay, so it is far from the best film ever made, but does that always matter?  Not to me.  This is simply a fun movie.  Overloaded with an amazing 'who's who' cast, a gorgeous heroine and an outstanding soundtrack (which I searched for at record shows and finally found) this film is the 60's incarnate.  A silly, sexy, swinging good time.  The limited edition DVD comes in a cool tin case and has a set of cards with comments and rememberances from most of the major cast members.  It's a treat!
B00004UFYU|5.0|To all those people fascinated with ERA, there is a German Band called Lesiem, Album title &quot;Mystic Spirit Voices&quot;. I got to find out about this group when I bought ERA and I must say that when I heard it, it was an amazing experience.  Lesiem is only available in Germany or through the Amazon German site.  Buy this album and you won't be disappointed, it is amazing.
B00005AFVR|2.0|This live CD was a big disappointment. First, let me say, that I was somewhat bothered originally that he chose to entitle it Live in New York City. What happened to New Jersey? I know that he probably wanted to include the American Skin song, which he didn't play in New Jersey, but come on - what could be a more rocking show than the one in New Jersey - his home state.<br />That being said, I bought the CD anyway. The sound quality was terrible, the songs rambled on, his voice sounded terrible in most songs. Having seen him live, there is an energy in the arena that you just can't capture in a CD, and you shouldn't try. The riff leading up to the end of Born to Run live was awesome - in the CD, lacking the energy of being there live - it just seemed to go on forever. Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out was great live - on the CD it was like nails on a chalkboard!<br />This is not to say that I won't listen to this occasionally - but I will certainly be putting other Springsteen CD's in the changer first!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I love Dido's songs especially Here With Me and Thankyou.  Those are just about my all time favorite songs.  I would recommend this c.d. to anyone.  Dido is a very good singer and her songs are the best.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This was one of the more surprising films I've seen in many years. I went expecting the film to be exactly what the story seemed to be, a young boy wants to be a dancer and though his father forbids it, his hopes triumph in the end. This is not inaccurate as much as overly simplistic.<br />This film examines not only the father's reaction, but the implausibility of the boy's dream considering the social climate of his home town. It explores the teacher/student relationship and we see the dream of any teacher coming true in her student, but after much conflict. Don't forget a driving force for the boy; his late mother. The power of a fallen parent's hopes for their child is not to be forgotten. Throw in the almost bizzare characters of the older brother and young friend and before the end, if you've paid attention, you find a film about much more than a boy and his dreams. You find the human essence. The ever present conflict of life lived true regardless of conflict or consequence.
6300214435|2.0|I am not going to give away the plot in this movie.  I hate it when people do that to me, so I will not tortue you that way. Anyway, I thought the plot was relatively bad.  Bad compared to other movies, awful compared to Raiders and Last Crusade.  I liked the music, special effects could have been better. Next:  realistic or not?<br />IT WAS UTTERLY UNREALISTIC!<br />How could putting a torch to someone's chest take them out of an evil trance?  How could a mine car going very quickly jump from one track onto another and somehow land perfectly?  How could a group of archers manage to fire hundreds of arrows at a target and somehow miss every shot by about two inches?<br />Anyway, it was not good enough to be a film even comparable to the other two Indiana Jones movies.  With how bad it was and how good the other two are, I wonder why they even bothered to make it.
0140434259|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable novel.  Ostensibly a social comedy centered on romance, this book is really an unusually acute description and analysis of the collision of Enlightenment rationalism (Sense) with the Romantic ideas of the early 19th century (Sensibility).  Austen uses the romantic entanglements of 2 sisters to present these contrasting views of life.  This is a remarkable way of showing how ideas permeate and influence the life of society as a whole.  The plotting, laden with clever irony, is brilliant, and the characters are drawn with Austen's usual insight.
B000056H25|3.0|This movie was good, no doubt about it.  Very well produced and directed.  GREAT cinematography.  I appreciated the actors portrayal of Christ. It was a very divine portrayal.  The movie is VERY reflective of Scripture and so I am surprised by some of the liberties taken by the producer.  The form of Judas' suicide is certainly the most obvious liberty because it is indeed a contradiction of Canonical Gospels.  The 4 Gospels are very short books - hardly  screenplays - and yet the movie leaves out so many important details that are given in these books.  Of the liberties taken to make this movie, I am very APPRECIATIVE that nearly all of the violence against Christ was left out of this movie.  As a result of this fine production decision, I can watch this movie with my children.  This is a very good movie, but it is definately not &quot;The Greatest&quot;.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Yes, it may be just the slightest bit manipulative. Yes, the stakes are raised SO high that one has no other choice but to cheer loudly for the hero. Yes, some parts feel extraneous. But you know what? These flaws I only noticed in retrospect. Viewing this movie was one of the ultimate pleasures of my life. It is beautiful, funny, heartwarming, tear-jerking, and wonderfully done. Jamie Bell gives one of the best child performances to date. The final moment of the film made me cry like a baby, as did several other moments in the film. Are certain elements gratuitive (the friend, the grandma)? Maybe. Are they distracting? No. The film is so well shot and so well edited that even the slower parts flow brilliantly with the rest of the film. I am a voting member of the Academy, and this was my pick for Best Picture (certainly more enjoyable than Gladiator). This movie is The Full Monty times 10!
B000001Y42|5.0|No matter how many each of their other two albums sell, Three Dollar Bill is always going to be Limp Bizkit's best album IMHO. It's the only LB album where I've been able to sit through it from beginning to end without skipping anything. Everything else they do is just icing on the cake.
B000059MEK|5.0|the joke here is you guys, who are bashing the album.  Daft punk wrote music they find good .. ignoring the rules that have been recently set by themsleves and other electronic muscians(one of them being the 6 min track rules .. ) the tracks all are still  original sounding, but contain some familiar sounds that people accociate with piop music .. you call it sell out all you want but its not gonna become the next spice girls .. and thier is real artiestry envolved here .. no corp is writting this music for them .. this is far more original than most of the new electronic music .. if daft punk wanted to sell out they would have stuck with trace and and the music they made on homework ..... that would have been a true sell out ..personally i think i would have been scared to change my sound this much after a big classic such as homework gave me the chance to become a musican who can live off his music alone<br />as for the music on this album some of the track are really great and get stuck in your head .. while others even get into your soul .. its great a well rounded experience daft punk have finnaly seperated themselves from the other electronic artiest . bravo .. tres tres chic .
B00004XONN|5.0|First, I must admit that I had a hell of a time adjusting to something as obtuse as OK Computer.  For a while, before I was enlightened, that album actually made me physically sick trying to listen to it.  However, in the end, it grew on me and became great.  I got Kid A on its debut day and was completely mesmerized and in love with from the very first moment.  Yes it is true -- it amazed me from the get-go.  This album is sonically beautiful and, in my opinion, much less grating and imposing than the majority of OK Computer.  When you think of OK Computer, think of an alien equivalent of The Beatles.  When you think of Kid A, think of an alien symphony composed by Mozart.
B000056K04|3.0|I purchased the new Dave Matthews Band CD with an open mind.  After listening to it over a period of a month or so, I came to the conclusion that it does not have the same ability to keep your interest as other DMB CDs have.  With this in mind, I would recommend to all Dave fans to get your hands on the unreleased &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; via Napster or a friend with a burner.  This is the Dave Matthews Band that the fans have grown to love, no influence from Ballard, just the band playing.  Once you get it, you won't be able to take it out of your CD player.
0312243022|5.0|I'm not going to go on and on about this book.  I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of hosannas being sung to Michael Cunningham and this unforgettable book.  I very rarely find myself in tears as I read the first chapter of a book and yet that is exactly what happened. The ironic thing is that this happened the SECOND time I read it; I already knew what was waiting for me around each corner.  The characters are drawn with an exquisite attention to detail. The scholarship which has allowed the author to bring &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; so lovingly to life for us is beyond impressive.  If they had never come up with Pulitzer Prizes before this volume was published, they would have had to invent them.  I place this little gem alongside Ishiguro's &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; and Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; and claim it as one of the finest works of fiction published in the past decade.
B00003CXDV|4.0|As in the cable release, one word of Sigourney Weaver's dialog is dubbed (as they are about to enter the crushers). The original expletive would have been much funnier, but sadly, they wimped out. Otherwise it would have rated 5 stars!
6302968143|4.0|I like this movie for several reasons.  For one thing, Bette Midler (as Winifred Sanderson, one of the witches) looks so ugly with her buck teeth, but she's also very funny.  I also think that the zombie, Billy (the one with his mouth sewn shut) is funny, the way he groans when he's hurt and loses his head (literally) twice.  What I also like is the theme of brother-sister love, such as the love that Thackery Binx, a 17th-century boy who's turned into a talking cat by the Sanderson sisters, feels for his deceased sister, Emily (who dies at the hands of the three witches).  I also like the funny lines-- like the scene where Billy tells Winifred to go to hell and she says, &quot;I've been there.  I find it quite lovely, thank you.&quot;  Normally, I don't watch Disney movies, but I like this one.  It'll put a spell on you!
0345440757|5.0|I loved this book!! I read this after my son turned 1.  I wish I would have bought it before he was born.  She makes so much sense!!  I don't believe in attachement parenting at all.  I also don't believe on &quot;demand&quot; feeding.  Like Tracey says, &quot;it makes a demanding child!&quot;  I know I don't want a demanding child!!  I will buy this book for EVERY pregnant women I know!
6305426651|5.0|This movie is Excellent (That's right... with a capital \\"E\\"). However, before I start praising this movie, may I send the shoppers my strong recommendation.... If you're going to buy this movie, buy the Italian version with English SUBTITLES. This way, you'll be able to enjoy the true talents of Roberto Benigni and the rest of the All-Star Italian cast. THE ENGLISH DUBBED VOICES ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD. It may be hard for some to get used to the subtitles and reading and listening to Italian while at the same time trying to follow the movie visually, but that's only for the first 15 minutes of the movie. After that, you'll be so used to them, sometimes the chracters will seem to be speaking English (Well figuratively speaking anyway).<br />With that out of the way, ... The movie itself comes highly recommended for a good laugh and/or cry. Why this film wasn't the winner of \\"Best Picture\\" is beyond my comprehension. The story, the script and the humorous and outstanding acting make this movie a must-see to anyone. But you don't have to take my word for it. Buy this movie (Remember... the subtitled version) with full speed.
0440180295|5.0|I would agree with the other reviews that say this book reminds them of Douglas Adams (or maybe Monty Python).  Phrases are repeated and things that seem to make no sense initially, come back later for some humorous irony.  Also, in typical Vonnegut style, there are no heroes or villains, and no punch-lines.<br />I also enjoyed the author's unusual directness and honesty.  If you are fortunate enough to read the version of this book which contains the author's introduction; Vonnegut writes, <br />&quot;The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it.  I am that person. I wrote this book, which earned a lot of money for me in royalties and made my reputation, such as it is.  One way or another, I got two or three dollars for every person killed.  Some business I'm in.&quot;<br />Ironically, the book that was supposed to be about the firebombing of Dresden, contains very little information regarding the actual event.  Vonnegut who witnessed the event first hand, admits that he had the intention of writing this fabulous book as soon as he returned from the war.  However, he states that he just didn't have enough material for a book. Twenty-five years later he produces a masterpiece!<br />This is a short book and requires little investment to enjoy.  I would recommend reading it in one sitting so that the many ironies are not lost.  Well worth the effort.
0792844793|5.0|This film is just plain amazing. Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank Booth is wonderful, along with Isabella Rossellini and Kyle MacLachlan who also star in this sick, twisted story viewed through the artistic eye of director, David Lynch...the story progresses into one of the strangest endings ever on film. Frank Booth is probably the greatest and coolest &quot;bad guy&quot; in any crime-drama film. Definitely worth every cent to buy this DVD.
079073804X|5.0|This movie is a great one to have.The acting is superb and the feeling you get while watching it is disturbing.Although many think the possesed girl is scary,she sorta comes off as funny.A great movie throughout though.

0930289234|5.0|When men first started drawing on caves, they might not have realized it, but they began the path that would eventually lead to Watchmen.  Some may rave about how Watchmen is the greatest piece of &quot;sequential art&quot; on the market, but I prefer to think of it as the best damn &quot;comic book&quot; ever written.<br />Make no mistake, Watchmen is about Superheroes.  Crazy guys in tights who, for many reasons, get off on beating the crap out of bad guys.  Moore dissects them, puts them back together and breathes a new life into them that would make Frankenstein proud.  Somewhere along the way, the story ceases to be about guys in tights, and starts to be a story about all of us.  How there are little pieces of us in all of these weird, tragic and ultimately human characters.  Some of them are truly twisted, but all of them possess something redeemable, something that makes them difficult to hate.  It's this level of human complexity, boiling beneath that colorful surface that makes Watchmen great.<br />The plot is huge and epic.  To me, there's nothing better than a story that starts small and ends somewhere so huge, so far away from the beginning that we have to look back and marvel at the beginning.  Watchmen is that kind of story.  Moore adds layer after layer, some of which seem strange and out of place at first, and weaves them all together into a seamless tapestry.<br />If this were only a novel, the plot and characterization would be enough to make Watchmen timeless, but the collaboration between Moore and Dave Gibbons is unparalleled.  Gibbons uses the art to layer another story, sometimes several stories on top of the original.  I've read this book hundreds of times and I can still find little pieces of the puzzle that I never noticed before.  Gibbons style is what makes the Watchmen world so different from the ones we've seen before.  A place out of synch with our own time, yet undeniably connected.  Many artists have tried this and failed.<br />So yes, Watchmen is a story about superheroes, but in the same way that Citizen Kane is about a sled.  It's only skimming the surface of what is ultimately a masterpiece of storytelling.
B000001FKY|5.0|First, about me - I love The Statler Brothers, classic country, traditional hymns, and pipe organs.  So, to say that this is one of the greatest albums ever made says a lot!  I believe that Hysteria is certainly the greatest album of the 80's, and I didn't even own a copy until 1991, long after the fad was over.  Boston's debut was the greatest album of the 70's, by the way.  I can't decide which album I like more, but they are both unbelievable.  You've got to own this CD - your tape will wear out too quickly.  Play it on a surround sound quality system - awesome!  &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Run Riot&quot; are my favorite songs.  Steve Clark's solo in &quot;Run Riot&quot; was fantastic.  I personally believe his death prevents them from ever playing that song again.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I would like to say that this movie is real good. I'm really glad I purchased this movie. The story is real good. Cameron Crowe knows how to make a movie that just makes you laugh and makes you sad. This is one of those movies that you just like to watch over and over. The acting is brilliant, Kate Hudson is perfect for this movie, Jason Lee (of mallrats fame) does a great performance. They all are good. Get this dvd!!
B000002G7G|5.0|I would argue that this is perhaps the best album by the VU. It's shocking to hear it initially because it is so mellow,though, you get used to it.    This contains some of Reeds finest lyrics and some of  Morrisons godliest solos. I do miss Cale and the craziness he gave to the band, but this album is still godly as ever.   My favorite two songs: &quot;I'm Set Free&quot;   and   &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot;<br />  Get It today! Shasta!
B00003CXB2|5.0|I have seen this movie on the big screen, vhs, and now dvd.  Of course, nothing compares to the big screen experience, but if you have a decent sized television and surround sound, the dvd experience is the next best thing.  I really can't add much to what is already known about this movie, but I will say that Peter O'Toole is the most glorious actor in the history of motion pictures.  That performance has never been matched, not even by O'Toole himself.  And as far as David Lean is concerned, he was at his peak as a director.  How much more can one accomplish after making a masterpiece?  I love this movie every time I see it, especially when campared to so called epics like &quot;Gladiator&quot; with it's muddied color and wooden acting.  By the dvd version and you'll have many hours to enjoy this wonderful film.  The scenery is simply stupendous and all the other actors are almost as good as O'Toole.  Buy it!!
B000008COG|1.0|THis is a lost album in AC/DC marvelllous discography. Nobody misses it .
B000059T5O|5.0|What a great album. Why can't there be more like this? The songs are amazing, the beat captivating, the tone warm, and the arrangements perfect! The lyrics roll along with the rhythm of a freight train rumbling down the tracks, so natural and powerful that I can't understand why everyone doesn't write songs this way. I have purchased way too many albums this year, and this one is easily among the best. It'll make you grin ear to ear from the first beat of the first tune. Just in time for driving along with the windows down, too. I just hope Tom Waits writes another album for Hammond again next year -- and that they do one duet.
B000009QPG|5.0|Along with &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; and &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, this is some of Slayer's best material.  The overall sound is basically the same as &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; but with more slower parts.  Songs like &quot;War Ensemble&quot;, &quot;Born of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Hallowed Point&quot; would fit perfectly on RIB, but &quot;Expendable Youth,&quot; &quot;Blood Red&quot;, and &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot; are much slower, and the title track is downright melodic at times.  Wow, that title track is amazing.  It builds up for about 2 or 3 minutes, starting with this slow, Sabbath-like riff, and then going into softer parts, and finally bursting into heaviness.  There are some great vocals from Tom Araya in there too, he even almost sings softly at times.  I'd say his vocals are pretty much at their best here, very hard-edged, yet listenable, and there is none of that weird squealing that seemed to run so rampant on the previous albums.  He can sing, by the way, listen to their cover of Sabbath's &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; to hear what his &quot;clean vocals&quot; sound like.  Besides the title track, another song really stands out here, and that is &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot;, a slow, bone-chilling ode to serial killer Ed Gein.  The song begins with a brief monologue (I'm assuming it's Tom that does it), which is supposed to be the voice of Gein, and toward the end you hear the terrified cries of a child, which is effective in its meaning, but the cries don't sound all that believable, it could have been done better.  It's still creepy though, I challenge you to listen to this song with the lights off.  Those two are the best, but there are no clinkers here.  I'm not sure if this is quite as good as the aforementioned Slayer albums, but I'd say that along with the vocals, the drumming is actually better.  I don't think I've heard better drumming anywhere.  You can go on all you want about Slipknot and their three drummers, but Dave Lombardo could outdo all three of them with one hand tied behind his back.  It's just too bad he left, Paul Bostaph comes very close, but no one can match Lombardo's skill.  If you are looking to buy a Slayer album, this one (along with the aforementioned ones) is a must-buy, but anything by Slayer (with the exception of &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;, where they suddenly started sounding like Marilyn Manson) is worth it.  Ignore my previous review where I said was not a Slayer fan.  Times have changed since then, and I am definitely a fan, and always will be, even if they never stop emulating Manson.  Slayer is an extremely talented band, one of the best out there, and I do not see how anyone could not recognize that.  Even if you can't handle their lyrics or extreme nature, I would think you could still recognize the talent.  But, I don't know.  Anyway, if you love great metal, you'll surely find it here.ee of them with one hand tied behind his back.

B00004RFFI|1.0|It would've gotten two stars if it had killed Helen Hunt and Bill Paxon when it had the chance. Look, the gist of this movie is that some intern in an effects studio was screwing around and created a very tornado-like image. Next thing you know, we have a movie. I sat through this train wreck of a film until I just couldn't stand it anymore. The acting is like an off night at a middle school production of &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. I'll recommend you buy this DVD, because there's no satisfaction like throwing the box into a deep river from a moving car when you watch more than ten minutes of this digitized crap-o-rama.
B00000JMQD|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was about 10 years old, and it was stuck in my mind ever since.  I just recently bought it and it brought back all those memories that stuck in my mind throughout.  It was better the second time around being that I can now fully understand the movie in it's grand scale.  Great effects and the way they implemented the original movie into this new plot was fascinating.  Anyone who liked the original movie and is in for a new twist and tangent should get it!
B0000256VK|5.0|I really cannot add anymore than what has been so eloquently stated in previous reviews. I do, however have to take up an issue with the reviewer &quot;Rossini.&quot; He uses Monet as a visual reference, and I feel that Monet's work does not transcend the level of a study, and certainly would not serve as an appropriate visual equivalent to Avalon. I felt the same soaring appreciation for Avalon as the first time I viewed Whistler's &quot;Egyptian Girl at the Chicago Art Institute. The lovingly executed brush strokes, with glimmers of highlights in the absolute perfect spots, convey the sumptuous beauty and exotic air about the model. It does a disservice to Roxy Music when comparing an almost detached, analytical observation of visual phenomena (Monet), with an incredibly rich and emotion-evoking album like &quot;Avalon.&quot;
B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe's rock 'n' roll loveletter to 70's excess hits all the right notes. The hipper-than-thou &quot;one-star&quot; contrarians and spiteful naysayers are just insanely jealous of the director's incredibly charmed life (I mean, c'mon...writer for Rolling Stone at 15, several acclaimed films by his early 40's, by all accounts an amiable, down-to-earth guy, married to Rock Babe Extraordinaire Nancy Wilson...he's living every American male's Peter Pan fantasy-I say more power to 'im!). &quot;Almost Famous&quot; joins &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; as another &quot;American Graffitti&quot; for those of us who reached young adulthood in the mid-70's (but hated Disco!). Crowe coaxes great performances from his ensemble, with standout turns from Billy &quot;Golden God&quot; Cruddup, Frances McDormand and the amazing Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who edges closer to becoming a national treasure with each successive role he tackles). In short, if you know what &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; sounds like with clicks, pops and turntable rumble...then you'll understand exactly what this film is about!
B00004LN16|4.0|Real rock for real rock fans.  Good hard blues/rock sound.  Brian is screeching and the guitars and drums sound great.  Lots of good hooks.  What else can you ask for?  Actually, here's one thing: The CD is write-protected.  Anyone know how to burn this thing?
B00000IPAX|2.0|sure, you can say what you want, but Blink is just another sellout band now. there are maybe 2 good songs on this whole CD, and most songs sound the same. i dont know about you but i am sick of seeing good bands sellout. pass this cd up and get dude ranch, some early blink when they were actually good.
B0000508U6|5.0|It is rare for an album to grab me on the very first track and keep me entranced all the way to the end...but that is exactly what happened when I unwrapped Parachutes and put it in my CD changer.  I am mesmerized by the soulfullness of Chris Martin's voice. When I first heard the song &quot;Yellow&quot; I wasnt sure who this band was but I knew I had to find out. My reward is endless listening pleasure. Martin's voice captivates and if I close my eyes for just a moment I would almost swear it was Nick Drake (a musical genius in his own right) reincarnated. I think my most favorite part of this album would have to be the tracks from &quot;Sparks&quot; through &quot;Parachutes&quot;...each song flows almost effortlessly into the next to create a vignet of feeling that is amazing and rich.

B00003XAQ5|4.0|Kind of Blue(KOB) is a true jazz classic and a top 10 desert island pick.  The SACD of this disc held great promise and even greater hype.  I just doesn't quite get there.  The now out of print Sony Mastersound edition (long box) with Super Bit Mapping gives the SACD a run for the money.  The SACD bests the SME in 3d soundstage and presence but not in tonality and detail.  As a high end retailer said to me, &quot;maybe the tapes are just gettin' too old&quot;.  If you have an SACD player, get this disc, if you don't, buy one and get this disc.  If you can find the Sony Mastersound Edition, by all means get it.  Either way, it never sounded so good, but for my money the SME will get more play than the SACD.  FYI...Time Out on SACD is mo better than the SME disc.
0553328255|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This guy &quot;wrote the book&quot; on page-turners.(literaly;-} ) You feel like you're right there with Holmes and Watson. You can hear the dog-carts as they rattle allong the dirt and cobblestone roads! You feel the cool breeze and as the book goes allong, you can't help but form your own theories! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is remarkable; a literary genieus! you'll read for hours on end because once you start, you CAN'T stop. Sherlock Holmes is a genieus in his line but he does have a sense of humor. I have yet to find even 1 book that is more thrilling. I hope that you'll lay your hands on a set of these remarkable books and enjoy them as much as I did! Happy Reading!
B000000OA6|4.0|When Queen recorded this album during 1989-1990, they knew that it could well be their last, not many bands record an album knowing that fact, still less so those who find that their break-up is going to be due to tragic circumstances, but Queen obviously put a lot of hard work into this album so that they can go out on a high! The overall sound seems funerreal, but they quality of the songs and lyrics are heartfelt and powerful! One cannot escape Freddie Mercury's battle with AIDS on this album, but at the same time one cannot escape Queen's love of life which permiates this album with rich and colourful sounds, one thinks especially of such tracks as 'I'm Going Slightly Mad', 'I Can't Live With You', 'All God's People', 'These are the Days of Our Lives', and 'The Show Must Go On'. And not since the Beatles Abbey Road album (that I know of) has a band decided to put a stamp out with the last song of a last album (Not of course, including 'Made in Heaven' which is almost as good)
0375703764|5.0|A riddle wrapped in an enigma surrounded by a puzzle. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is creepy fun. Take your time and enjoy this one (you may have to), but it's time well-invested. I first saw bits and pieces of this book on the net, and couldn't wait for a fully bound volume. Danielewski fills pages with random notes, puzzles, backwards and upside-down print, poems, letters, photos and collages that all add up to a story about a man driven insane by the discovery of a monograph about a non-existant documentary, which just might have awakened an ambigously evil force. The characters are very real, the puzzles and notes fun to decipher and the obscure references fly faster than an episode of MST3K. It was refreshing to find that an experimental novel could be so much fun. I can't wait for Mr. Danielewski's next effort.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Jennifer's fresh new talent, and beautiful image is the perfect example of today's music genre without a doubt. Although Jennifer's vocals are really nothing to speak about, she does do excellent job at delivering notes in an even manner which is more than I can say for other artists (i.e. Britney Spears, Mandy Moore etc..). On her debut album, Ms. Lopez seems to have an affinity for dance music, R&amp;B, Rap, Pop, Ballads, and Spanish numbers, which is a very good selection for just a debut album. I have reviewed each of the songs by order, and I hope you find these reviews helpful:<br />1. If You Had My Love: One of my favorite songs, and her first single of the album. Jennifer's voice has never been so strong, and who can't resist the impeccable dance beat? 10/10<br />2. Should've Never: A pretty ballad, but the ballad is just a tad bit too long, but Jennifer's talent for ballads really shines through. 8.5/10<br />3. Too Late: I didn't like this ballad/pop song very much, the chorus sounds out of tune and it doesn't match Jennifer's lovely vocals either. 4/10<br />4. Feelin' So Good: Also a favorite of mine, I like the choice of rappers on this song (Big Pun, and Fat Joe). The beat is very fun, and Jennifer's vocals are at their finest. 10/10<br />5. Let's Get Loud: This song was written by Gloria Estefan, and the beat is so latin and yet a fun song to dance to. It's not the best dance song though. 9/10<br />6. Could This Be Love: An average ballad, but Jennifer's vocals are really pretty here, give it a few listens for it to kick in. 7.5/10<br />7. No Me Ames (Tropical Remix): Very beautiful Spanish ballad! This is a duet with Marc Anthony, a fantastic latin singer. The remix is great, and should find a few people on the dance floor. 10/10<br />8. Waiting For Tonight: #1 favorite on this album. Jennifer's vocals have never sounded so nice, and the beat is fantastic and is already becoming one of Jennifer's hits. 10/10<br />9. Open Off My Love: A very sensual popsong, and you might find yourself playing it over again just being mesmerized. Not one of my favorites, but great nonetheless. 8.5/10<br />10. Promise Me You'll Try: Favorite ballad on the album. Jennifer's vocals are at their best here, and the slow beat is so relaxing. 10/10<br />11. It's Not That Serious: Another ballad, not one of my favorites but it is fun in it's own way. 7.5/10<br />12. Talk About Us: Another ballad, most likely a tribute to Puffy. It's most likely my second favorite ballad on this album, it will start to grow on you after a while and will become addictive. 10/10<br />13. No Me Ames (Ballad Version): This is the ballad version of No Me Ames, it's still great with or without the remix. 10/10<br />14. Una Noche Mas: This is the Spanish version of &quot;Waiting For Tonight,&quot; fun and will appeal to anyone who likes Spanish numbers or to Jennifer's latin audience. <br />The effort that went in to making this album, is nothing short of amazing and Jennifer deserves two thumbs up. Buy this album because I believe anyone will grow to love Jennifer if you just listen to her music, and don't judge her like everyone else has.
B00003CXGG|5.0|Of course the kids loved it, but so did the adults. I took one of my good friends on a date to see this movie. Both being almost 18 years old, I felt like I'd fall asleep during a Disney movie. But I didn't. I loved it. I started laughing from the very beginning. The Emporer, played by David Spade, is just great. Spade uses that sarcasim that is well-known from his SNL days, and Tommy Boy. Even the dim-witted body guard was great. He had me laughing all the time. Getting beyond the sentimental value of that night, this is a really good movie, and that is why I gave it the 5 star.
B000003TAR|5.0|THERE'S NO DENYING THE FACT THAT IN UTERO WAS KURT COBAIN'S GREATEST WORK. HE PROMISED HIS FANS THAT THIS ALBUM WOULD BE THE UTIMATE NIRVANA EXPERIENCE, AND IN MY OPINION, IT IS. IN UTERO POSSESSES A CERTAIN, UNEXPLAINABLE EERIENESS. PERHAPS THE MOST REMEMBERED SONG FEATURED ON NIRVANA'S LAST STUDIO ALBUM WAS HEART-SHAPED BOX, BUT THERE ARE DOTHER MEMORABLE SONGS AS WELL. ALL APOLOGIES, DUMB, AND TOURETTES ALL HELP TO PLACE COBAIN AT THE CENTER OF A MAN WHO LOST HOPE FOR HIS OWN FUTURE, AND SADLY, SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE RELEASE OF IN UTERO, THE LEAD SIGER AND SONGWRITER OF ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BANDS WAS DEAD. KURT COBAIN MAY HAVE DIED OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO, BUT THE LEGACY HE LEFT BEHIND WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US, AND THIS ALBUM, NO DOUBT, HELPS TO RELATE THAT LEGACY TO THOSE WHO NEVER KNEW OF NIRVANA'S SUCCESS. IN UTERO STANDS OUT ON IT'S OWN, AND THATS IMPORTANT. NEVERMIND PALES IN COMPARISON TO THIS RECORD. 1993 WAS DESTINED TO BE THE YEAR THAT NIRVANA REDEFINED A GENERATION THROUGH MUSIC THAT HELPS TO SUGGEST A DISTURBED STATE OF MIND. KURT COBAIN WAS NIRVANA, AND WHEN HE DIED, NIRVANA DIED WITH HIM. BUT STILL, IN UTERO IS REMEMBERED BY ALL WHO FEELS ANGST TOWARDS SOCIETY AND AUTHORITARIAN SOURCES. KURT COBAIN WAS INDEED THE VOICE OF A GENERATION. IN UTERO, IN MY OPINION, CANNOT BE IGNORED OR PUT TO THE SIDE. THERE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHED TO THIS RECORD THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE IT'S INFLUENCE WITHOUT COMPARING THE MAN WHO MADE THE RECORD. IN LIGHT OF COBAIN'S DEATH IN 1994, THE LYRICS TO IN UTERO PAINT A DISTURBING PICTURE OF SELF-DESTRUCTION AND HOPELESSNESS. BUT ALL THAT ASIDE, I RANK IN UTERO AS THE GREATEST ALBUM NIRVANA EVER MADE OR EVER WILL MAKE. IT'S AS THOUGHTFUL AS IT IS INTROSPECTIVE, BUT THEN AGAIN, THAT'S THE WAY KURT WANTED IT TOO. SO GO AHEAD, BUY THIS RECORD, CRANK IT UP, AND LEARN HOW TO TRASH A GUITAR.
B000000OQY|5.0|Even though GnR Lies wasn't the official followup to Appetite for Destruction, Guns n Roses released it to hold their fans over until their next album. This release is made up of their 1986 ep, Live Like A Suicide, and 4 new acoutsic based songs recorded in 1988. GnR Lies is nothing short of amazing. The live songs beginning with Reckless Life are prefect examples of why Guns n Roses were one of the top bands on Sunset Strip. The band is very solid, Slash's guitar playing is great, and Axl Rose's voice is in top form. Nice Boys and Move to the City are both great songs and thier cover of Aerosmith's Mama Kin is top notch. The acoustic songs on the album are also excellent. The only single from the album, Patience is the first of the acoustic tracks. This is a great song, one of their best. The next song is Used to Love Her. The song is written about kind of a sick subject, if you want to hear it pick up the album. The next song is a redone version of Your Crazy which is on Appetite, I personally prefer this version over the original, even though both are good. The last song is the controversial One in a Million. This song is filled with comments on various social issues, but with all that aside it is a great song. This album is definately a worthwhile purchase, just because this isn't the official followup to appetite, don't overlook it.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I recently purchased Mutter by Rammstein. It is a good CD(check out #3-Sonne great song) The backround music is awesome has great melody to it. the songs are good like #3 sonne it rocks!!! The only problem that i have with the cd that it is 100% german. Unlike the old cd none of the songs are translated to english in the old CD Du Haust  and other songs were tranlated for you. This CD is all german. The hit song Links 234 is also a good song. IF you are looking for a heavy hitting band with good song,and meledys. The lyrics are a little hard to pick up but who cares its good music with a hard rock kind of sound. If you like Korn+ other hard hitting bands buy this! U gotta ge t this CD!!!
B00005AFVR|3.0|Let's face it, this is not a five star release.  Let's save those for Born To Run, Darkness and Nebraska.  While offering many fine performances of old favorites (including The River, Lost in the Flood, and the country and western version of Mansion on the Hill) and newer gems (American Skin is a great song), there are glaring weaknesses.  The sound is fair, the sequencing is weak, and the editing is non-existent. The fact that the packaging is incomplete is inexcusable for a label such as Columbia, let alone for Bruce.  <br />As far as the performances go, I enjoyed the show on HBO far more than I enjoyed listening to the CD.  I guess this should not be surprising given the visual effect Bruce has on an audience as he dances (ambles?) around the stage, working the crowd like an old carnival barker.  Without these visuals, and without any trace of the audience coming through the mix, the CD seems rather sterile.<br />This is not to say that most of the performances are not stellar.  Except for a few songs which are way overblown -- most notably Tenth Avenue Freeze Out -- Bruce continues to set the standard for all live shows.  And while he may have lost some of the youthful exuberance he had 20 years ago (who hasn't), he doesn't embarrass himself the way other aging rock and roll stars so often do (are you listening Mick?)  <br />All in all, the disk is certainly worth the $20.00 price of admission (unless you don't already own all Bruce's other albums -- if you don't, use the $20.00 to buy them first).  However, if you can wait for the DVD to come out, you might enjoy it more, especially if it contains any extra footage, interviews, production background, backstage clips, or maybe studio versions of the new songs.<br />Hey Bruce, that was a hint!
0060930187|3.0|Reading Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar, is like entering the life of a young woman that is trying to grow up in a male-dominated society.     The main chareacter, Esther Greenwood, is approached by many mental and physacle obsticles. Her mind is overcomed by many emotions and menatlly challenged problems.  She struggles with many issues from suicide to relationships.      The Bell Jar is a great book for woman and especially teens.  It deals with some issues that young ladies deal with everyday.  Esther Greenwood portrayed a self-reliant woman, but was in need of help from the world that she avoided.  Sylvia's style of writing is very simplistic and easy to understand, but is also full of radiant detail. It's not a story that causes bordem, but instead curiosity and interest.      This book is said to be a reflection of the Plath's life,but is also a reflecton to lives of many young woman all over the world. This novel is some what disturbing but is a true American classic.
0811826848|5.0|I am reading 'The Beatles Anthology' at the moment and I think it is great! At first, I didn;t know what to expect but it is brill! As it is actually written by the fab 4 who changed music, you know that it is what really happened! It gives u loads of info on the actual musical side of things and not just their amazing story from going from working class lads struggling to get a job in a terrible club to 4 of the most talented musicians in the world! Being a musician myself, I found the way that they actually wrote about every album is very informative and it has helped me to write reviews for my own website which I have just started! allyouneedislovefab4.homestead.com - please please me by visiting as it is a very new website! anyway, the anthology is nicely written and easy to understand and it keeps you interested at every point of their musical story! It is probably the best beatles book on earth, or even across the universe.....
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you just bought a Playstation 2, you'll need a memory card.  I greatly recommend this product, because it is durable and is of high quality. It also contains 8mb of memory, which is alot. You will be able to save plenty of games and you'll make the most out of your system. However you cannot save Playstation One games on a Plastation 2 memory card, and Playstation 2 games on a Playstation memory card. This is often overlooked by many costumers and they end up buying the wrong one. Anyway this is a great product!
B00005ABX0|4.0|Don't let anyone fool you, this is NOT SMiLE! This is Mike Love taking over the group. Except for recordings they canibilized from SMiLE, there is zero production, because Brian left the group. Mike even changed the words to Heroes and Villians, and Vegatables because the original lyrics were too hard for him to understand. Go on the web and download the original SMiLE music. (Although you CAN find half of the SMiLE music on &quot;30 Years&quot;, out of sequence)
B000023VR6|2.0|Dr. Dre's second solo album really fails to impress.  Dre relied on too many ghost producers and new, inexperienced rappers to do most of his work on this album.  This has got to be the most over-rated album for 1999-2000.  Kurupt's The Street's Is A Mutha was a classic and a WAY better album.  Yet it only sold about an eighth as much as this did.  The Chronic was an undisputed classic, and though it would be unfair to compare Dre nowadays to the way he was then, he could've done much better than this.  There are over twenty songs on this album, and only about three to five of them are really good.  Hittman was an impressive guest, and the additions of Snoop Dogg and Kurupt were also smart moves.  Where was RBX, Warren G, The D.O.C., Daz Dillinger, The Lady Of Rage?  Dre &quot;Forgot about them&quot; I guess.  Speaking of which &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; featuring Eminem is a terrible song, it's totally catered for the radio, and MTV teenyboppers, yuck.  &quot;Big Ego's&quot; featuring Hittman is a nice song, and &quot;B*tch N*ggaz&quot; featuring Snoop and Hittman is good, Hittman actually disses CJ Mac here and does a pretty good job.  &quot;Explosive&quot; was decent, Nate Dogg and Kurupt saved the track, Dre didn't even rap on it.  &quot;Let's Get High&quot; with Kurupt was okay because Kurupt saved it again, and &quot;Still Dre&quot; with Snoop was a good track.  &quot;Housewife&quot; was good because it's a Kurupt track and Dre remixed it and even this version (different from the one on Kurupt's album) is only good.  Overall four or five honestly good songs and the rest was pure filler.  Overall if Dre wants to improve he should try actually TAKING PART in the making of his album.  But the beats were not good at all on this album.  Dre's rapping was average.  The only plus was having Nate Dogg, Kurupt, Snoop and Hittman on the album.
B00005IC52|5.0|I have searched 15 years for a decent print of this great movie. It is absolutely astonishing how Bob Clark's truly terrifying masterpiece Black Christmas - a pioneering horror flick - has faded from the minds of moviegoers. A suspense sensation on its initial release in the early 1970s, Black Christmas is without doubt a must-have for all horror movie collectors. Starring cutie pie Olivia Hussey - fresh from her success in Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet - and a groovy Margot Kidder - fresh from her horror success in De Palma's Sisters, Black Christmas is the forgotten forerunner of the slasher genre that would spawn later classics like Halloween and Scream...But the staple conventions of the slasher movie: virginal heroine; promiscuous victims; psychopathic stalker; subjective camera; ambiguous ending are all established in THIS movie...And as for the \\"harassment by phone / caller is in the house\\" scenario that everyone thinks comes from When a Stranger Calls - it all started here. As a fan of all these movies, I can tell you Black Christmas is definitely the scariest of the lot. The story of a demented madman stalking the sisters of a college sorority house, the movie quickly ratchets up to 10 on the suspense-o-meter and sustains it to the end with a series of truly evil murders and unforgettable horror images. From the eye in the door crack; the plastic-bagged corpse; the rocking chair; the house mother yanked off her feet into the ceiling; Bob Clarke hits all the right notes to seal his place as a one-hit wonder of the genre. But what a hit it is. Pure, efficient terror at its most extreme. A great, scary date movie you will not watch alone, I rate it as one of the five scariest movies of all time...I guarantee you'll be watching it over and over to share it terrors with friends and family out for a real scare. Suspense brilliance that has rarely been equalled. Respect!
6300214044|5.0|Sad, disturbing, and powerful are all good words to describe this beautiful motion picture directed by David Lynch. Filmed in black and white, it tells the true and altogether touching story of John Merrick, a young man so grotesquely deformed he was forced to spend most of his short life as a carnival sideshow attraction.<br />     Though he is looked upon and treated as an animal by both those who put him on display and others still who pay money to see him, Merrick's fortune soon takes a turn for the better in the guise of Dr. Treves. Treves, portrayed brilliantly by actor Anthony Hopkins, takes John into his care and tries to instill within him a sense of love, dignity, and acceptance.<br />     You won't see a more emotionally draining movie than this one. It's an important film and one that I truly believe parents should watch with their older children, especially given that it's based on a true story and would do well in teaching them acceptance for differences in others.<br />     Very well made and highly recommended.
6304493681|5.0|The art in the DVD is breathtaking - clear sharp images, awesome soundtrack. If you enjoy anime, this is a MUST for your DVD collection. Be sure to watch it as it should be seen, with the native language spoken and English subtitles. Captivating plot, though watch this one without interruptions, you miss a few minutes and you won't know what's going on. This is my favorite anime movie - illustration and soundtrack A+.
B00004YKUY|4.0|In 1999, I GAVE away my Journey tickets to friends when I found out that some Kenny G lookin' dude named Augeri replaced Perry.  What a mistake. I missed out. Fan reactions definitely were full of jaw-drops and creative profanity following Augeri's performance.  Thinking of Trial By Fire, I bought the new Arrival CD with little enthusiasm.  At least the cover doesn't look like an ad for a travel package to Jamaica.  Then I heard it off my 10&quot; woofers.  Man, I cranked that *&amp;$# up to force the public to hear.  That's how much I enjoyed this album.  Other reviewers were right to say that it's the best since &quot;Escape.&quot; For some reason, &quot;Higher Places&quot; reminded me of Van Halen's &quot;Top of the World&quot;.  The rock element in Journey has finally surfaced.  Van Halen was fortunate to have Sammy Hagar who already made it big as a solo.  Journey has a harder road because Augeri is still a no-namer, but have a real chance of restoring itself as a true rock band, something founder Rolie wouldn't mind at all.  Bottomline, Arrival is great for Journey fans who can focus appreciation for Schon, Cain and Valory.  Die-hard Perry fans will remain unconvinced but tolerate the new Journey as a refreshing oasis in this vast desert of slacker rock, country twang and rap crap.
B000002L68|5.0|Nothin' more 2 say. purple rain is the album every artist should dream 2 record, it's necessary in every house, like the bible. Enjoy it. Peace.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This movie was overlooked at the Academy Awards. This was a great movie and I thought that Jamie Bell deserved a nod as the title character who learns to express himself through dance even though he has to hide that fact that he is dancing from his father and the rest of his family. Julie Walters deserved her best supporting nod as the tough chain smoking dance instructer who sees the potential in Billy and tries to help him realize it. This one of the movies that make you go through the gambit of emotions. It makes you laugh, cry, think, and at the end make you feel good about yourself.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Without a doubt,by far the most overated,waste of time film I have ever seen....endless cliche, endless characters you couldn't possibly care less about, and the added insult to injury of it being 2 hours long.... See Spinal Tap instead.....superior in every conceivable way.... I wish I could have gotten comfortable enough to go to sleep through this, since dreaming would have been far more entertaining.....
6304297912|2.0|Another glossily realized finally trite/empty celebration of life without ideas, intelligence, foolish hobbies like learning or responsibility. The celebration is stylistic rather than substantial. TRAINSPOTTING is even-handed enough, underneath, but sensational on its surface, which is as far as the typical sophomoric hipster dude/dudette ever bothers to penetrate. Detached. Not even close to harrowing enough. Commercial trash?
B0000027EP|5.0|I have to say this is one of their best recordings. 1991's 1916 combines many facets of this incredable band.  The title song is the saddest out of the lot, but still delivers an enormous impact. No fan should be without this album.  Truly a magnificent work of art.
0767903854|4.0|In a Sunburned Country is combines comical anecdotes with historical informaiton. Although less kneeslappingly funny than &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; it is a solid account of Australia. By all accounts, Bill Bryson is all praise for Australia,  and as a result the humor is less cutting and sarcastic than it is in some of his other novels. <br />I would suggest waiting for this book to come out in paperback before purchasing it. It is hilarious in parts and extremely informative in others. It's a solid pick for lovers of travel literature [or Bill Bryson].
B000059T5O|2.0|Who's idea was this anyway?  Dull, affected vocalizing on top of some of the most overwrought musical cliches heard this year.  Softening the songs doesn't do anything for them.  The real thing is so much stronger than this tepid offering.
B0000047CX|5.0|I was driving to work one morning, on the Washington Capitol Beltway (not exactly a drive thru the park), when I was overcome by that smooth song on the radio- I was holding back the tears.  I had been in Rio over the holidays...I think that the song &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; is as equally as good as being there.  CIAO people.
B00004XONN|4.0|... but now i love it.  i must admit, i hated this album the first twenty-something times i listened to it.  but then it started to grow on me.  and grow.  and grow.     and now i can honestly say that i love this album.  while it is not as fun to listen to as &quot;the bends&quot; and &quot;ok computer&quot;, it is a better album as a whole.  &quot;everything in its right place&quot;, &quot;how to disappear completely&quot;, &quot;treefingers&quot; and &quot;morning bell&quot; are all beautiful pieces of music after you really start listening to them.     but if that doesn't convince you to buy this album, maybe &quot;idiotheque&quot; will.  it is easily the best on this album, and i think it ranks just behind &quot;fake plastic trees&quot; as the best radiohead song ever.  it also is the only song on the album that holds up on its own, which is why i'm surprised it wasn't released as a single.     do yourself a favor ... buy this album.  and don't give up on it after a couple of listens.  you'll be glad you did.
0805047905|4.0|&quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear&quot; and &quot;Polar Bear, Polar Bear&quot; are two of my 12-month old son's favorite books.  The repetitive manner keeps him interested.  He knows the rhythm and turns the pages when necessary for me.  Although he cannot say the names of the animals yet, he does recognize them.  He gets upset if he is looking for a certain animal, and it is not in &quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear&quot;, so he will go and pick up &quot;Polar Bear, Polar Bear&quot;, and page through it until he finds the proper animal.  At one time or another a certain color catches his eye, and he is only interested in that animal for awhile.  At first it was the green animals, the peacock for example.  Now it is the purple cat.  Who knows what it will be tomorrow.  But his favorite part of the book is the last page, where all of the animals are in front of him and he can point at them and I will tell him what each one is. I am positive this book will help him in animal identification real soon.<br />After reading the book for the eighth time in a night the animals all begin to sound the same.  But, it keeps my sons interest and attention, so it is well worth it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|With his second album, GZA takes you through his dark and somewhat scary chamber with lethally real lyrics and foreboding beats provided by RZA.  Incredible storytelling injected with a seriousness unmatched by any other rapper.  His delivery and cleverness keeps the album a privilage to listen to all the way through.  Just an amazing hip hop album from one of the most talented rappers to ever grace the mic.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|Now for those of you who think you've seen all the formulas that Hollywood has to offer, this is the movie for you.<br />It's a cross between &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Fields Of Dreams.&quot; Starring Dennis Quaid as the deceased father from the sixties, and James Caviezel as his son in the present, who accidently start communicating via HAM radio during a freak Aurora Beorealis. <br />It's a very intresting look at how just one changed historical event in a person's life can cause a ripple effect that can create havoc in that persons present day existence.<br />Ladies, I highly recommend this film, it is a great father/son movie, for it's been known to make grown men cry.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Though I'm not too keen on some of the stuff Eminem offends, I really like his music. The Marshall Mathers LP is really good. And he has talent whether or not you suckers believe it. My favorite songs are &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, and &quot;Drug Ballad&quot;. Excellent vocals and this one bad boy can really rap. I love this CD. It's great!
0446605409|4.0|Our hero, John Corey, does a little bit too much spinning towards the end, turning what could have been a very believable murder mystery into a not so real scenario. Since the book is fairly factual in it's historical and geographical details, the reader comes to expect lots of fact, mixed in with all the good humor, the adventure, the fun, the mystery itself, and the unbelievable descriptions. When John Corey begins to take the homicide case on by himself (with the help of a female cop, Beth Penrose), the plot becomes shaky. In all, a wonderfully worthwhile read about a fabulous character, who is well developed and great to get to know. John Corey is a convalescing NYPD homicide cop, who finds himself involved, both personally and a little bit professionally, in a homicide case involving Plum Island, a very factual place with tons of history. Though way out of his jurisdiction and eventually out of his mind, the story is wild with action and absorbent with enough facts to keep you page turning. A great read, even when Nelson Demille, the author, does stretch it a bit.
0679882820|5.0|Not only does my 12-month old son want me to read this book over and over and over again, but I truly enjoy reading this book.  It's sing-song manner is spriteful and uplifting.  I have even memorized this book and find myself subconsciously reciting it at work.  The words jumping out of the page &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom&quot; or &quot;Dibble Dibble Dop&quot; give me the freedom of expressing myself in a more outlandish manner when reading the book, making it much more fun.  I recommend this book to any parent who wants a book that is fun to read.
B0000507UD|3.0|This CD is...ok. I like Significant Other better. &quot;Rollin&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot; is kind of ok. I don't really like any of the songs in this CD, but I'm a Limp Bizkit fan, so this CD is ok.
B000003S0P|5.0|A lean, mean, fighting King.  This is the line up that worked best for me.  Cut down to the lowest common denominator with Wetton on the bottom and vox, Bruford on the tubs and Fripp of guitar and mellotron.  <br />The music is everywhere from the Industrial title track to an apocalyptic ballad &quot;Starless&quot;, to an equally haunting &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, to the avant garde &quot;Providence&quot;.<br />Bruford plays his best since Yes' Close to the Edge&quot; and does not match it again until the UK debut.  Wetton's voice is spine tingling and earnest, his singular best work.  Fripp is at the top of his frenetic game.<br />If it weren't for the tempers and egos of this trio, they should still be together putting the world on its ear.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is my second favorite band and their new cd rocks!  It's totally different from their other three cds but the quality is equal to the others. I fell in love with it when I got it and I can't stop playing it.  I feel that Ok Computer is their best album, but listening to Kid A is a delight.  My favorite track is &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; it's absolutely fabulous. Radiohead isn't afraid to go out on a limb and try new things.  Incorporating instrumental music and opera-like singing in with rock is fantastic.  His voice is great as usual, and you won't be disappointed at all with this cd.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is the best by Pink Floyd, and perhaps the best album of all time. I heard that album is haunting, and that's it. There are nine tracks in the cd, all perfect. &quot;Speak To Me / Breathe In The Air&quot;: A good way to start the album. Very haunting. Similar to &quot;Us And Them&quot;. &quot;On The Run&quot;: An almost electronic song (who said that electronica isn't analog?) which is very good to listen in your car. &quot;Time&quot;: Very popular Floyd song (a song about time). Rocker. The second part of &quot;Time&quot; is a reprise to &quot;Breathe In The Air&quot;. &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot;: Haunting Instrumental. Very sad song. It's about death. Female vocals on this one. &quot;Money&quot;: The best track on the album, along with Brain Damage. 7/4 timing and cash registers. Also has a great saxophone solo. &quot;Us And Them&quot;: THE &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; song. It's slow and smooth, with echo voice. The last part of it is called &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;. &quot;Brain Damage&quot;: Amazing song about... brain damage. Highlight. It's a sad song. &quot;Eclipse&quot;: The outro to the album. It's only 2 minutes, but it's the highlight of the album. With a heartbeat in the end.<br />Notes: 1) If you start the CD at the third roar of the MGM lion in the Wizard Of Oz movie, the album matches with the film. 2) The End Of &quot;Time&quot; / Start of &quot;Great Gig...&quot; is very haunting and sad. It goes along with a dramatic film. 3) &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is very haunting album. I'll give 20$ to whom find me a darker and more haunting album.<br />Buy it now.
B000005J56|5.0|I also echo the praises of the heartfelt musical performances on this CD, but in addition, I want to draw attention to how well the music is recorded and mastered.  The musicians are so spontaneous in their performances that all the detail captured in the recording enhances the listening experience, giving it a &quot;live&quot; texture that's so important for this music.  The CD's booklet notes that the recordings were made mostly at Egrem Studios in Havana, Cuba.  I would say the Cubans are light years ahead of the American pop music recordists -- the accuracy which the intruments and vocals are captured is stunning.  For example, the armonico used by Compay Segundo in &quot;Y Tu Que Has Hecho&quot; is captured in all its crystal.  The piano timber in performances by Ruben Gonzalez are spot on.  Ibrahim Ferrer sings three feet in front of you in &quot;Dos Gardenias&quot;.  The only track with mastering problems is &quot;Candela&quot; where the left channel is sporadically attenuated, but it is hard to notice with such a spirited performance.  What a CD!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Wow! OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN is actually not a bad album. I'm kinda ashamed that I like this CD, because it's more like a guilty pleasure. This is definitely different from her last album (despite all you people out there who think differenly!). Y'all might not believe it, but this gal has got some talent that she's been hiding from us all until now! It's kinda scary, but I can listen to OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN all the way through without skipping any songs! The cover of the CD may look a bit tacky, but it's pretty cool, too.<br />My favorites on this CD are &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;. &quot;When You're Eyes Say It&quot;, and &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On My Door&quot;. I also like &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, mainly because Britney wrote it herself and I think she did a pretty damn' good job (even though it's a little cheesy). Britney shows her true &quot;hidden&quot; talent on songs like &quot;When You're Eyes Say It&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;, and &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;. So if you think Britney can't sing, well why don't you try listening to those songs?!<br />Personally, I think this is a much better album than her debut, ...BABY ONE MORE TIME. OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN is more moody and more emotional, too. And it went better on the Pop Charts, too. This is Britney's more mature side. Her last album was more of a Bubblegum, party-fun type album. This is a more serious, mature album. I actually liked both CDs. Hopefully Britney's third will be even better than this!<br />Great CD. Pleasantly surprised! :)
B000005J08|5.0|This album is one of the Holy Grails of modern music.  In this album, Zorn destroys the walls separating genre with a giant saxophone sledgehammer, with his cohorts, Horowitz, Frith, Frisell, Baron, and Japanoize pioneer Yamatsuka Eye, gleefully helping him.  If you truly want to have your musical ideals challenged and your ear expanded, I wholeheartedly recommend this album.  It takes you farther than you thought possible.
6300184064|5.0|This film is a masterpiece, but it is so disturbing that it's difficult for many people to watch or understand. It's not the theme that's difficult. That's easy--the theme is bureauocracy as the devourer of men's souls. It's the style in which this film is made that drives critics up a wall.<br /><br />The visuals are strong and biting; enemies of the State are apprehended in the most callous way, hooked up like sides of beef in a refrigerated paddy wagon on the way to lock-up (or the butcher shop?) The set is creatively ugly, with ubiquitous monitors in a utilitarian design that speaks of a society stripped of every single aspect of humanity. Against that background, the character played by Pryce attempts to retain his own humanity against horrible odds. His vision of an angel-like woman is akin to Goethe's \\"Ewigweiblichkeit\\" (eternal femininity) at the end of Faust.<br /><br />No doubt 50 years from now, Brazil will be hailed as a monumental achievement of 20th century film. Right now, it's pretty much misunderstood.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is one of those books that never gets old. I'm only fifteen but I've read it at least seven times front to back. I've written fan fiction for it (as well as some really strange Dune/Star Wars crossovers) and find it intriguing, confusing, and beautiful. When I first read the book I was about eleven, and have devoured the rest of the series in the time since.<br />If you enjoy an intellectually stimulating read, this is it.
0767802551|4.0|Johnny Depp is by far my favorite actor, and his talent as well as his smoldering good looks, shine through in this movie.  Al Pacino is also marvelous as Lefty.  I read this novel and I wish that the movie had started with Agent Pistones adjustment into the mobster world, which the book explains perfectly.
B000000WCA|5.0|How could anyone not like this CD? My two sisters make fun of me because they catch me still listening to it. But I can't help it! When I like a CD, I don't just listen to it until it's not popular anymore...I continue to listen to it forever! Why else would you buy a CD unless you plan on listening to it more than once?<br />Anyway, SPICE is probably the Spice Girls' best CD, though I don't really like their new one, FOREVER, all that much. Probably because Ginger Spice left the group and now it's rumored that Sporty Spice is going to be leaving the group, too! My favs on this CD are: &quot;Wannabe&quot;, &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Last Time Lover&quot;, &quot;Love Thing&quot;, &quot;Mama&quot;, and &quot;Something Kind of Funny&quot;. They've got great vocals and the lyrics are fun and party-like. SPICE is not really supposed to be a serious CD at all. So all of you out there looking for serious CDs...this is not it! But if you're just looking for fun, relaxing CDs, then this is a great one to add to your collection (if you haven't, already). Go out and buy this CD and I know you will not regret it.
B000009QPE|5.0|Going to be short winded. One of the greatest metal albums ever. Probably at least in the top 3, best thrash album of all time. Makes me regret some of the stuff i used to listen to when this was out there all along and the foolish things i've said about musicians that don't even compare to these guys. Kerry King is one of the best metal guitarists ever....some of the most complex solos in the history of metal are found on this disc. Dave Lombardo's drums are fast and furious through it all....he's definitely great at what he does. I'm not a true metalhead but i don't think any true metalhead could live with themselves without having this album.
B00000K2SE|5.0|This has to be one of my top 10 favorite films. The plot is unique; a world where virtual reality is more real and more dangerous than actual reality and where the borders between them are tenuous at best. The shock scenes that reveal the truth are so well done, I can't begin to describe them. You just have to experience it.<br />The special effects in this film changed forever how such effects are done in film. The actors move in ways you can't imagine. The Kung-fu scenes are so good, I watch them again and again. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Ann Moss give phenomenal performances in the Matrix. The entire film is done with such incredible quality of effects, direction and acting, that it's no wonder this was an immediate cult classic. The score is great, too.<br />It's worth having the widescreen edition to appreciate the cinematography, and DVD for the surround sound, as the score is so good.
0767836324|5.0|Spielberg has managed to create a wonderful film here, despite what the critics say. It's true you need to be a kid at heart to love it... but once you're into it you'll be amazed at what you find.<br /> A brilliant set makes for a real dreamworld in Never-Neverland, the star-studded cast makes for a very lively and utterly delightful performance while the film still also contains some meaningful moments. A terrific balance.<br />CRITICS!<br /> Often reviews seem to find great fault with this film while acknowledging there's something there - but what do they say is wrong?<br /> The Never-kids apparently don't fit! Well see it for yourself, I'd like to know what they should look like?<br /> Changing the story to some is unforgivable! There are alot of films where they change things or write a later on version (as Hook is to Peter Pan) and they are awful - total cringe films. The twist in Hook I very much appreciate however and I think it credits the original. <br /> The acting is too plainand unlively! No way. I think here we come back to the type of film - it's a kid's movie! So change, and become like a child, then watch it... I'm sure you'll love it!
B000056VIY|5.0|J. LO is the new album Jennifer Lopez has to offer to the world. And I believe that it has, musically, topped her 1999 smash hit album, ON THE 6. J. LO has some awesome songs on it! My personal favorite tracks on this CD are \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\", \\"Play\\", \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" (my new favorite!), \\"Ain't It Funny\\", \\"Carino\\", \\"Come Over\\", \\"We Gotta Talk\\", \\"That's Not Me\\", \\"Dance With Me\\", and \\"Secretly\\". I also like \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\". J. LO is a great mix of funky, uptempo Latin dance songs and beautiful slow ballads. And all the lyrics are different and Jennifer Lopez's vocals are really good! She can really sing, despite all the negative reviews who claim she can't. She's a better singer than Britney Spears - so you can't compare her voice to Britney's! I haven't bought this album yet, but I'm definitely planning to. I also love ON THE 6, which I also recommend if you like J. LO. This CD is totally awesome and a must-buy for all Jennifer Lopez fans or Latin mus!ic fans. And despite that use of the [swear] word in the song, \\"Play\\", this album is pretty clean. J. LO is an incredible piece of music! Go buy this CD and I can gaurantee you'll love it.
0140135154|5.0|A wonderful introductory adventure into the politics of looking. Anyone with an interest in art and cultural perception will find Berger an insightful and clever narrator.<br />Art students who skip this read are really missing out.
B000059MEK|5.0|One More Time, Digital Love, and Face to Face are worth the price of admission, and Discovery doesn't stop there.
1559408898|5.0|After i bought this DVD the other day, i was outstanded and amazed by all the quality features and bonuses. yet it remains a brilliant classic.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Ok first up, Amazon's review was written by a critic so u can completely disreguard it, for what really matters is what the public likes and not what one person of some company says. Second, this is the best Green Day CD out, with &quot;Nimrod&quot; close behind. This album just shows how Green Day has matured and can bring more to the table then &quot;PUNK ROCK&quot;, even though &quot;PUNK ROCK&quot; is alsome, it is limited by age and less to sing about, well Green Day has passed that mark and has become, not a &quot;POP&quot; band (which really pisses me off when people call them that, for &quot;POP&quot; is Britney Spears and NSYNC and we all know how far they r from that), anyway they r not &quot;POP&quot; but a great &quot;ROCK&quot; band and can be compared to the likes of Oasis, Incubus and mabey someday even the Beatles. I love this band and hope they continue to preform with the talent and that Billy Joe continues to hold onto that great song writing ability. If u call yourself a music fan then buy this Album, you will not regret it, unless u like Kenny G, then you probially don't even like the Beatles. Well I hope this helped anyone who was woundering about this album. Thanks (and for GREEN DAY, ROCK ON!)
B00004Z459|5.0|I usually hesitate when I buy c.d.'s because most of the time I end up liking 2 or 3 songs and the rest are just soso. Not so this time! Its so unique that I couldn't possibly put into one category. If you like hard core rock with a funky beat, true to life lyrics, and really &quot;get into&quot; your music, this is the cd for you. Every track rocks!
6304143184|2.0|There were some good things about this movie. Henry Thomas was one of them. Drew Barrymore turned in the only good work of her professional career. There was an occasional touch of humor (E.T. hiding among the stuffed animals in the closet, for example). <br />But overall, it was maudlin and lacked consistency, and was diluted by the cheap laughs that Hollywood garners by having little kids use vulgar language. Also, It doesn't take a genius to see the pseudo-religious allegory in the story. That probably says a lot about our society; people reject traditional religion, but still have a yearning to believe in something bigger and better than themselves. They satisfy that yearning by believing in warm and fuzzy aliens. Hence the hordes of people who give this very unexceptional movie 5 stars.
B000002U9K|5.0|When you find a band with an extraordinary debut like this it?s hard not to predict a great future. Sure the PSB had it as you all know. This is one of my favorites PSB album very italo-disco influenced but with the own british synth pop trademark PSB sound they still use today with such success. Besides from the obvious hits, my favorite songs are Violence (very special mood song and drum sequence) and Tonight is Forever. That song is a such a gem. Also the album version of &quot;Suburbia&quot; is a raw cut, not as produced as the single but equally enjoyable because of it?s rythming. All in all these songs are the foundations of the PSB sound they still use today. A super debut by all means and enjoyable even if this is the first full PSB album you are going to hear.
1558216847|5.0|The Long Walk has now become an absolute favourite of mine with never a dull moment. A tale about the journey of a young Polish officer who is arrested at the begining of the second world war,accused of being a spy. Moment to moment endurance through the harshest prison conditions, compassion shown and friendships built in these almost unreal conditions and despite huge odds his escape from siberia to India with six others. Gripping and a must read for those who love adventure and the best tales of the human spirit.
0140434089|5.0|I say The Moonstone is 'almost' excellent because I've read The Woman In White, which is by far a superior novel. If Wilkie Collins had not written The Woman In White, I would say that The Moonstone is an excellent book, but the author has surpassed that. The Moonstone is an interesting crime novel where the narrative changes several times throughout the novel. This is a very interesting technique that keeps you turning the pages to see what the next character will have to say about the mysterious disappearance of the Indian Diamond, the Moonstone. Wilkie Collins has created a very interesting and diverse set of characters. Definately recommended.
0425166805|2.0|Von Däniken claims that the myths, arts, social organizations, etc., of ancient cultures were introduced by astronauts from another world. He questions not just the capacity for memory, but the capacity for culture and civilization itself, in ancient peoples. Prehistoric humans did not develop their own arts and technologies, but rather were taught art and science by visitors from outer space.<br />Where is the proof for von Däniken's claims? Some of it was fraudulent. For example, he produced photographs of pottery that  he claimed had been found in an archaeological dig. The pottery depicts flying saucers and was said to have been dated from Biblical times. However, investigators from Nova (the fine public-television science program) found the potter who had made the allegedly ancient pots. They confronted von Däniken with evidence of his fraud. His reply was that his deception was justified because some people would only believe if they saw proof (&quot;The Case of the Ancient Astronauts,&quot; first aired 3/8/78, done in conjunction with BBC's Horizon and Peter Spry-Leverton)! <br />However, most of von Däniken's evidence is in the form of specious and fallacious arguments. His data consists mainly of archaeological sites and ancient myths. He begins with the ancient astronaut assumption and then forces all data to fit the idea. For example, in Nazca, Peru, he explains giant animal drawings in the desert as an ancient alien airport. The fact that the lines of the drawing would be useless as a runway for any real aircraft because of their narrowness is conveniently ignored by von Däniken. The likelihood that these drawings related to the natives' science or mythology is not considered. He also frequently reverts to false dilemma reasoning of the following type: &quot;Either this data is to be explained by assuming these primitive idiots did this themselves or we must accept the more plausible notion that they got help from extremely advanced peoples who musthave come from other planets where such technologies as anti-gravity devices had been invented.&quot; His devotion to this theory has not dwindled, despite contrary evidence, as is evidenced by still another book on the subject, Arrival of the Gods : Revealing the Alien Landing Sites at Nazca (1998).<br />There have been many critics of von Däniken's notions, but Ronald Story stands out as the most thorough. Most critics of von Däniken's theory point out that prehistoric peoples were not the helpless, incompetent, forgetful savages he makes them out to be. (They must have at least been intelligent enough to understand the language and teachings of their celestial instructors--no small feat!) It is true that we still do not know how the ancients accomplished some of their more astounding physical and technological feats. We still wonder how the ancient Egyptians raised giant obelisks in the desert and how stone age men and women moved huge cut stones and placed them in position in dolmens and passage graves. We are amazed by the giant carved heads on Easter Island and wonder why they were done, who did them, and why they abandoned the place. We may someday have the answers to our questions, but they are most likely to come from scientific investigation not pseudoscientific speculation. For example, observing contemporary stone age peoples in Papua New Guinea, where huge stones are still found on top of tombs, has taught us how the ancients may have accomplished the same thing with little more than ropes of organic material, wooden levers and shovels, a little ingenuity and a good deal of human strength. <br />We have no reason to believe our ancient ancestors' memories were so much worse than our own that they could not remember these alien visitations well enough to preserve an accurate account of them. There is little evidence to support the notion that ancient myths and religious stories are the distorted and imperfect recollection of ancient astronauts recorded by ancient priests. The evidence to the contrary--that prehistoric or 'primitive' peoples were (and are) quite intelligent and resourceful--is overwhelming. <br />Of course, it is possible that visitors from outer space did land on earth a few thousand years ago and communicate with our ancestors. But it seems more likely that prehistoric peoples themselves were responsible for their own art, technology and culture. Why concoct such an explanation as von Däniken's? To do so may increase the mystery and romance of one's theory, but it also makes it less reasonable, especially when one's theory seems inconsistent with what we already know about the world. The ancient astronaut hypothesis is unnecessary. Occam's razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is a Buddhist message.<br />&quot;It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything.&quot;<br />&quot;The things you own end up owning you.&quot;<br />These messages dominate the movie.<br />Forget about the point of a degrading society. This movie is about an individual letting go - including letting go of a society's standards. Letting go of what you think are your needs. This includes anything that you think is important - because it isn't. Believing in FREEDOM is supporting that which you hate as well as that which you love. <br />When one can extend this message completely throughout his life - where no circumstance is inherently different from any other - then he is enlightened.<br />To all the buddhists out there (I am not one) I caution you at seeking enlightenment. For a living, I create artificial intelligence simulations. My progressing understanding of what I may be and the way my awareness works has brought me increasing levels of depression. If there are those that think I have yet to learn, I caution them the same.<br />Fight Club stands alone - in my mind the best movie ever made - (The Matrix, Star Wars and The Godfather were up there).  Much of this is due to its message but its presentation is first rate.<br />Don't see it twice - see it 100 times. It is remarkably consistent, rich and if you give it a chance will change what you are.<br />I've quit my job a long time ago - but I still go to that job.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's debut offering, _Dummy_, may be best known for the James Bond-esque \\"Sour Times\\" track that received decent mainstream airplay.  But digging further into the disc, one unearths a true musical marvel, a sound that is at once old and new, fused with a lyrical delivery that makes the album timeless.  _Dummy_ takes what later came to be known as trip-hop and elevates it to a level that no one else has yet to match.<br />To be sure, tracks like \\"Sour Times\\" and \\"Wandering Star\\" are more in line with the traditional sense of the genre, but still contain enough unique qualities to separate Portishead from other trip-hop artists.  The production is simply superb, with every bass line, and every sample, fitting perfectly into each track, giving every song its own distinctive atmosphere.  There are no unnecessary flourishes, no attempts to sully the songs with trendier beats or catchier melodies; the songs are true to themselves, and while that may not always result in a radio-friendly track, the songs are much better for it.<br />When Beth Gibbons is given more melancholy subject matter to sing about, however, it punctuates her haunting delivery and produces incredible tracks.  \\"Roads\\" is a painful journey through the soul, and the heartbreaking tone of \\"Glory Box,\\" combined with its minimal yet sweeping backdrop, has to be heard to be believed.  Gibbons and the rest of Portishead are masters at producing a very brooding sound, and when that sound is matched with apropos lyrics, the result is music that defies description.<br />_Dummy_ is the pinnacle of trip-hop, and perhaps one of the defining CDs of 1990's electronic music.  Others have attempted to \\"humanize\\" electronic music, and some have succeeded, but few can dream of matching the miraculous sound created by Portishead on this disc.
B000002BFL|5.0|Another bit of proof that Springsteen is a true artist.<br />He hasn't simply stolen characters from Steinbeck and others; he turned them into modern day men and women, melded and welded them into his own vision, made them a part of his ongoing observations of America.<br />&quot;The highway is alive tonight, but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes...where it's headin' everybody knows,&quot; Springsteen sings on the title track.  That's a real downer, coming from a guy who used to use the Highway as a metaphor for hope.  But these aren't the young &quot;Born To Run&quot; Jersey kids, who wanted to hit the road to find their fortune.  The characters on TOM JOAD have been thrown on the road, displaced and hunting for a meal or a job.  They want to get off the road but, as the Joads found in GRAPES OF WRATH, nobody wants you to stop at their place.<br />As with so many of his recent records, Bruce delivers one absolutely flawless vocal.  &quot;Highway 25&quot; sounds like &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; or &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; but is, thematically, cut from the same cloth as NEBRASKA.  Like so much of NEBRASKA, it sounds like the courtroom confession of a killer, in this case a man who doesn't quite believe he let himself fall so far off the path.  At the beginning of the song he works in a shoe store.  He flirts with a customer, and before he knows it they are in &quot;a small town bank...well, I had a gun.  You know the rest.&quot;<br />There's so much more I could say--about Bruce's evolving use of symbolism and metaphor, about how cars and the road and rivers are used over and over in ways that shape character and event, about how he uses songs to write novels, and all the other pompous Critic-Talk--but what's the point.  You get it.<br />This is a GREAT album, great on a level that most popular music never even approaches.<br />Frankly, I think the best of Springsteen--BORN TO RUN, THE RIVER, NEBRASKA, and THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD--are the kind of things Dylan always strived for, but only achieved on infrequent occasions.<br />I don't consider Springsteen the new Dylan.  I consider Dylan the old Springsteen.
B00004XONN|5.0|I don't see how others gave this album such bad reviews. I enjoy the earlier Radiohead albums immensely, but unlike other reviewers I don't think that this one is horrendous, or a step in the wrong direction. It certainly isn't a conventional rock album, even by Radiohead's standards, and I think this is probably why people dislike it - it is a slight change of direction for the band, or perhaps a quicker evolution towards a new sound then some people would like to see. This is not a bad thing. Kid A had me captivated from the first time I listened to it, from the twisted lulluby that is the title track to the driving &quot;National Anthem&quot; (which evokes images of a totalitarian state in one's head), to the amazing Idioteque with it's oxy-moronic (but brilliant) lyrics+singing and infectious beat, to the &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; which is a great way to end the album. The whole album sounds somewhat like an epic soundtrack, and has to be (well I think it's best if) listened to from beginning to end to get the most enjoyment out of it. This shouldn't be any problem though, because none of the tracks deserve to be skipped. To dismiss this album as mere random noise like something Yoko Ono and Lennon released together is the ultimate injustice one can do it - this album has very definately been crafted with care and precision, and the music is of a very high standard. There are definate tunes to each song, and an overall feel to the whole album which I am amazed others have not grasped. This album deserves five stars, because it is a masterpiece by anyone's standards - even Radiohead's.
0449002632|4.0|If you've read other people's reviews, you know by now this book reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel.  <br />That being out of the way, let me say that the stories are delightful.  There are 21 of them averaging 40-50 pages, I'd give many of them 5 stars, some 4 and some 3, averaging it out to a four star book.  <br />The stories are an incredible weave of drama, history, romance, suspense, mystery, horror (yes, the plague!), anthropology, politics, psychology,  and more.  There is an incredible cast of characters, many you will root for, some you will boo and hiss when they appear.  I'll agree with some other reviewers, it can be hard to keep track of all the characters.  True, you can still enjoy chapters 18-21 without remembering anything about chapters 1-4, but the geneaology is tied together throughout in interesting ways, and it can be interesting to see similar characteristics pop up in a family through the years, some subtle and some &quot;in your face&quot;(one obvious one that comes up over and over is the Ducket/Dogget family with a white streak in their hair and webbed hands...)<br />Also fun to read are the many &quot;cameo&quot; appearances by real-life historical figures.  From Julius Caesar, to Geoffrey Chaucer and Shakespeare, to Pocohontas.  I like the fact that none of the stories actually focus on these major figures however (that's all been done before) . . .they're all about the &quot;common man,&quot; the affect that historical developments have on several every day people, from the poor to the wealthy.<br />Rutherfurd touches upon many historical happenings, some major, some minor.  But he makes it fun to read, no matter what the subject.  <br />My favorites were &quot;Londinium,&quot; &quot;London Bridge,&quot; &quot;The Tower,&quot; &quot;The Whorehouse,&quot; and &quot;The Globe.&quot; <br />Why didn't I give it five stars?  A few of the stories got a little too political and hard for me to keep track of who was in what party and had which viewpoints.  But overall, he keep the politics light and easy to read in most of the stories.  <br />I'd suggest that anybody give it a try.  If the first few stories suck you in, be prepared for 800 plus pages of reading pleasure!
B00000099Y|5.0|To put it simply, The members of tool have the deepest lyrics on the rock market today. Melodic tunes accompanied by lyrics with dark undertones and hidden agendas make trying to figure out the entire meaning of a song just as much fun as thrashing around to the music on the album. There is an inherent beauty to the sounds produced by the band which is almost surreal. This is to date the finest album I have ever encountered. I am looking forward to the next album so i can &quot;buy buy buy their new record. buy buy buy send more money.&quot;
B000059HCI|5.0|amazing, too beautiful, the best film I've ever seen in my life. this movie is about true love...
B00003CXFV|4.0|I did enjoy watching this film.  It's well made, well acted and well edited.  Unfortunately, to some extent it felt like a 'painting-by-numbers' exercise.  <br />EB recounts the unlikely story of an unemployed, divorced mother who talks her way into a clerical job, spots an anomoly in an - apparently minor - real estate deal and goes on to successfully sue a large conglomerate for a record sum.<br />What is unusual about this film is that story, though unlikely, is based in fact and the film direction largely avoids the usual clichés of painting all the characters as heroes and villians.  In fact, other than a couple of minor characters there are no 'baddies' in the film at all.  The story concentrates more on the efforts of 'little people' to get on with their lives and what happens when they come up against the apparently immovable bulk of a multi-million dollar organization that is damaging their lives.<br />Albert Finney certainly excels as the lawyer but the casting of Julia Roberts, a major, rich and confident Hollywood star, as EB, a harrased, divorced, poor and unemployed mother, was risky.  It's a credit to her acting ability that she largely manages to carry it off.  It wasn't until I saw the interview with EB (on the DVD) that I realised how well she did.<br />The DVD contains many deleted scenes, both as filmed and also with a talk-over by the director Steven Sonderberg.  Seeing what he cut out of the film and hearing why is a wonderful insight into the background of both the film and the original (true) story.  It is such extras that really elevate the DVD over the video.<br />Vince O'Sullivan.
0060930349|2.0|While I admire Paul Johnson's conservatism and think that he has some interesting takes on American history, I thought the book had too many factual errors to be taken seriously. For example, Johnson confuses Confederate generals Joseph Johnston and Albert Sidney Johnston, complimenting Joseph's performance at First Bull Run (rightly) and then crediting him with leading the surprise attack at the Battle of Shiloh and saying he was killed there (wrongly...that was ALBERT SIDNEY Johnston...Joe was still back in Virginia). He also credits the Pinkerton Detective Agency with  providing Union general George McClellan with excellent military intelligence, which is absolutely false. Pinkerton provided McClellan with outrageously inflated estimates of the numbers in Lee's army, contributing to McClellan's excessive caution. I'm just scratching the surface here, because these types of factual errors are scattered throughout the book. Paul Johnson should've researched the material more thoroughly.
B000002KKC|5.0|After the major success of Rumours, everyone expected Fleetwood Mac's follow up to be Rumours II.  Instead Lindsay Buckingham used the clout he had at the time to release a sprawling two record set, Tusk, that was anything but a Rumours clone.  Mr. Buckingham urged the other two songwriters in the band, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, to push their creative boundaries and the results are challenging but overall immensely satisfying.  Ms. McVie sticks the closest to her roots on songs like the upbeat &quot;Think About Me&quot; and the soft &quot;Never Tonight&quot;, but on &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; there is gorgeous vocal interplay between the three singers.  Ms. Nicks is on the top of her game on the mystical &quot;Storms&quot;, &quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot; and the lush &quot;Angel&quot;.  Her crowing moment is &quot;Sara&quot; which appears in its edited form on the cd.  Even in its abbreviated form, the song is absolutely stunning and brilliant, but to experience its full power the nine minute version is required listening.  The song peaked at number 7 on the charts and deserved higher.  As good as the Ms. Nicks is on the album, it's Mr. Buckingham's baby and he has never been better.  He experiments with the production sound all over the album and he shows he has almost as good an ear as one of his idols, Brian Wilson.  &quot;That's Enough For Me&quot; has a crazy fuzz guitar on it, &quot;The Ledge&quot; is a bizarre sounding number, &quot;Never Make Me Cry&quot; is a great duet with Christine McVie, but the creme de la creme is the title track.  It is an amalgamation of world beat sounds, weirdly distorted vocals and an appearance by the USC Trojans marching band.  John McVie lays down his heaviest bass line ever and Mick Fleetwood plays tribal like drums fills that make up a completely original and brilliant piece of music.  To show the band's popularity at the time, the song, which hardly has a top 40 radio sound, became a top ten hit, peaking at number 8.  Obviously Tusk did not come close to matching the sales of Rumours, but what album could.  It was considered a disappointment, but in hindsight a double album of experimental tunes that sells over 5 million copies can hardly be considered disappointing.Obviously Tusk did not come close to matching the sales of Rumours, but what album could.

6305358613|4.0|Ignore the fools who would dismiss this startling film over historical inaccuracies.  As in a Shakespeare history play, 'history' is a background against which director Kapur frames his uncomfortable insights about power: the way it is based on god-like surveillance, murder, blasphemous invocations of religion etc.; and, more frighteningly, the way power is represented in art-forms, like masques, boat rides, costumes, the very images used in these artworks (e.g. the debate about the body and the body politic) - even, I guess, Shakespeare plays.  And the best Shakespeare history plays were always about his present.  Sometimes the film feels a little too CGI in its effects, but its mordant, violent and systematic cynicism makes it refreshing in a decade of limp costume dramas, and Geoffrey Rush once again proves why he is a titan among modern actors.
B000002KGT|5.0|After their breakthrough success with their self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac should have been on top of the world.  Instead, success led to tensions in the band that would result in the two couples, Buckingham-Nicks &amp; the McVie's, dissolving their relationships.  There was tremendous friction when the band entered the studio to record the follow up album.  It was those frictions and breakups that fueled the album and turned it into one of the classic albums of the 70's and in rock history.  Rumours contains 11 songs in which many deal with the breakups.  To hear Lindsay Buckingham &amp; Stevie Nicks sing the searing &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; together when you know that the song was written about their situation adds an extra edge to the song that can't be created if the song was about someone else.  &quot;The Chain&quot; has a dark and ironic urgency to it and the bouncy beats of &quot;Second Hand News&quot; mask angry and bitter lyrics.  &quot;Dreams&quot; is a bittersweet song that captures the essence of Stevie Nicks.  It has a mystical, ethereal sound with deep lyrics and it has the witchy feel that made Ms. Nicks the high priestess of rock.  The song became the album's and the band's only number one single. Ms. Nicks also shines on the eerie &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; that is a thinly veiled song about her cocaine abuse. The song dips and dives with stinging guitars and dirge like Hammond organ.  Not every song is down cast, &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is a classic anthem of optimism and hope in which Christine McVie &amp; Mr. Buckingham's vocals intertwine perfectly to capture the feeling that tomorrow will soon be here.  &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; is a bouncy song that must have burned John McVie as Christine McVie wrote it about her new lover.  &quot;Songbird&quot; is an elegantly beautiful song that is just Ms. McVie on vocals and piano and its position right in the middle of the album provides a respite from the album's high tensions.  Rumours not only capitalized on the success of their prior album, but it was so big that it became a cultural touchstone.  The album spent a staggering 31 weeks at number one in 1977, became the first album to spawn four top ten hits and ranks as one of the five biggest selling albums in history with over 20 million in sales.nly capitalized on the success of their prior album, but it was so big that it became a cultural touchstone.

B00003CXN4|5.0|It is not the job of great directors - like Hitchcock or Sirk - to simply film the scripts they are given.  They should be more like critics, interpreting the script, opening up its assumptions, undermining its neatness.  Soderbergh follows in this great tradition.  'Traffic' has a brilliant script, but its traumas are contained in implausible formal neatness, with some audience-pleasing concessions.  Soderbergh rejects this neatness, most obviously in the way his stark colour-coding - sepia monochrome for stereotypically sinister Mexico; 'normal' colour for 'normal' US - seeps its boundaries, the one messing up the other, just as the border between the two countries becomes a kind of fairy tale threshold; here the aims of 'reality' or 'realism' become impossible.  In the process he turns a good script into a modern film masterpiece.
B000002KXO|5.0|After the highly experimental Tusk was released in 1979, Fleetwood Mac would not release another studio album until Mirage in 1982.  The album marked a return to the Southern California sound that they created on their first two albums together.  Tusk is a great album, but was missing was the vocal interplay between the vocalists, especially Lindsay Buckingham and Christine McVie.  They pair up for some great numbers together including the album's biggest hit, the sprightly &quot;Hold Me&quot; which ranks as one of the best songs in their catalog.  Ms. McVie provides the bouncy &quot;Love In Store&quot; and &quot;Only Over You&quot; which is about her relationship with Beach Boy Dennis Wilson.  Mr. Buckingham is in fine form on the deep &quot;Book Of Love&quot; and the fun &quot;Oh Diane&quot;.  Stevie Nicks was the unquestioned star of the band at this time after the release of her hugely successful solo debut, Bella Donna.  But she doesn't coast here with the exceptional &quot;Gypsy&quot; particularly standing out.  Mirage was a return to the top of the charts, peaking at number one in the fall of '82.  It would be the last time they would hit number one until their big comeback with The Dance in 1997.
B000056K04|1.0|It's just weak.  Weak melody, harmony, lyrics, instrumentation, arranging, singing, it's all weak.  What a boring piece of garbage.<br />&quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; was a masterpiece, but as they say, you've got your whole life to gather material for your first album...  This record has eliminated all that was exciting about the band.  Carter Beauford's drums are relegated to background status when he is actually the musicial focus of the group's sound, whether you realize it or not.  His drumming used to provide the push, the buildup, the excitement that is obviously missing from their latest work, especially this one.<br />There are no memorable, hummable, stick-in-your-head melodies like &quot;Ants Marching&quot; and no daring, original, never-heard-before harmonies like &quot;Best of What's Around.&quot;  This isn't going to inspire any air-drumming or singing along.  It's just thrown together, over-produced dreck.  People will buy it and convince themselves they like it based on the band's past reputation, but the CD will soon languish on a shelf.  Dave Matthews' creative period is over.
B000002L9Y|3.0|Tango In The Night was release 5 years after its predecessor, Mirage.  In those 5 years, the band members each pursued their own projects.  Tango In The Night has the feel of an album that sort of just thrown together to fulfill a contract.  Lindsay Buckingham seems to be the most disinterested and besides his brilliant &quot;Big Love&quot;, he doesn't contribute anything that matches up with his usual excellence.  You get the feeling he was holding his best stuff for his solo work.  Stevie Nicks supplies the airy &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; which is a solid single and the sequel to &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Welcome To The Room...Sara&quot;, but not much else.  Christine McVie fairs the overall best with the catchy &quot;Little Lies&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot;.  This would be the last album from the Fleetwood Mac lineup that produced their biggest hits and it is a letdown compared to their top work.  Despite the five year absence, they showed they could still be a force on the charts as the album hit the top ten and spawned four top twenty singles including two of their highest charting singles, &quot;Big Love&quot; at number 5 and &quot;little Lies&quot; at number 4.

I would love to have a factory recording of a show recorded in front of about 5000 - 10000 fans from start to finish.   While some of the big hits are on the cd, I found the arrangements to be far from the best he has done.     If this is what his live shows are going to be like in the future I will stay home and listen to an old bootleg.   Even with all the faults I have to give it 3 Stars.

B00005A1PR|5.0|If you love music, I mean good music, this is a must have for your cd collection.  I first heard India Arie on the Bamboozled soundtrack and couldn't wait for her cd to be released.  This is by far one of the best cd's I've ever bought.  The fact the she not only writes music but plays the guitar is what impresses me. This is a truly talented woman, her voice is so rich and so deep.  If you are a fan of Jill Scott and Erykah Badu, you will definitely love India Arie.  A force to be reckoned with.  My favorites on the cd are:Video, Strength, Courage and Wisdom, Brown Skin, Back to the Middle and I See God in You.
6303073107|3.0|While I love Kurosawa's samurai films and the great &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, I think &quot;Rashomon&quot; is overrated, probably because 1) people who watch it already heard it was good, and 2) the cultured Western audience finds the story and acting exotic enough to be fascinating.<br />I cannot say I dislike the film; in fact I like it.  But I think the acting is over dramatic and the camera shots too staged.  The acting in particular irks me, much like that in &quot;Ran&quot;, because it looks too much like kabuki on stage.  But &quot;Rashomon&quot; does have its style; it's just not a style I find comfortable with.<br />The best part about &quot;Rashomon&quot; is its masteful editing techniques, which hides quite a few continuity flaws.  In the end, very few of my Asian friends -- esp. Japanese -- like the movie because they view it portraying Asians in a negative light.  I think this is something to be kept in mind as you watch it.
0780622553|5.0|This is science fiction as it is meant to be made.  A story that is worthy of classic science fiction, the movie the Matrix should have been.  This movie draws the viewer in with its masterfull visial depcitions, and allows the imagination to run abound.  <br />      This may not be the most originall story, but it is certianly not cliche, and besides that is beside the point.  Like most great science fiction, this movie is driven by an idea, and that idea is what makes the story turn.  To enjoy this movie the veiwer has to place onself within this world, and come to understand all of the things that this implies.  This movie starts out disguising itself as a mystery, and then preceeds to unveil a vision much more interesting than anything Perot ever did.  <br />      This movie is directed in a style of film noir.  This results in a city that is darker and more moving than &quot;Batman&quot;, and gives the movie more of an edge than &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.  This is a movie that can be easily mis-understood.  I do not suggest watching this movie if you are not in the mood to pay attention, or think about what the movie doing.  Unlike most of what Hollywood creates, this movie does not do all of its thinking for the viewer.  This is what makes the movie so great.  The greatness is in how it helps the viewer's imagination run wilde through this terrible and beutiful universe.
0393317552|3.0|Book Review of Jared Diamond&#8217;s Guns, Germs, and Steel by Joylyn Stover<br />As a second year student at Olivet College in Michigan, I was given the opportunity to incorporate Guns, Germs, and Steel into my Civilization Studies course.  I chose this book because I wanted to see history from a new perspective, focusing more on the science aspects.  As part of the course requirements, I am posting my critical analysis of his book and how it affected me as a student.     Jared Diamond certainly has an interesting take on the history of the early civilizations.  Throughout his book, he attempts to explain the rise and fall of civilizations through a non racist look.  He explains how agriculture, domesticating animals and natural resources affected the destiny of the early civilizations.  His overall thesis states that it was geography that gave civilizations an advantage for survival.  This is a convincing claim, yet how true and believable is it?<br />Diamond successfully explains several aspects that lead to the powerful, dominating societies we see today.  One of those is the transition from hunter gatherers to that of farmers.  Once a society began producing surpluses of food, families grew larger and homes were established.  Property lines were distinguished and laws came into play.  Occupational positions outside of agriculture were necessary and were sustained through the excess of food produced on the farms.  This also led to the advancements in technology.  Weaponry and exploration by sea became more important trades with the help of agriculture sustenance.  This inevitably led to an explosion of wars and the conquering of less technologically advanced societies.<br />Although many societies lived in areas that did not lend itself to be farmed.  Many geographic features hindered societies from this advancement such as the Arctic or desert regions.  In such a case as the Aborigines, the land was incapable of sustaining sufficient plant life to support a growing community.  In this situation, the Aborigines were forced to continue living in a hunter and gatherer society.  The consequences of this outcome is evident when Diamond analyzes the Aborigines' way of life which is similar to that of hunter gatherers a thousand years ago.  They continue living without the extra &#8220;cargo&#8221; that many of the developed nations have.  <br />Diamond makes an unfortunate statement that &#8220;hunter gatherers met one of two fates: either they were displaced by neighboring food producers, or else they survived only by adopting food production themselves.&#8221;  Typically this is what happened to many of the communities.  They often were low in population and were inexperienced with weaponry and organized defense and lost their battles with neighboring societies.  <br />Throughout the book, he supports his theories with intelligent and reasonable evidence that makes his claims believed wholeheartedly.  Unfortunately, he disregards other influences on society growth and advancement such as religion, culture and general human decisions.  Does this mean that if the Aborigines had geographic conditions that allowed for the domesticating of plants and animals and an agriculture surplus they would have dominated as a society?  Diamond fails to include other influential factors that disagree with his theory of geographic determination.<br />Jared Diamond&#8217;s book is effective in that he looks at history from many diverse angles.  He dissects issues of agriculture, animal domestication, disease, language development and most of all geography and the role they played in the success of the early civilizations.  His take on history is easily understood and explains to a great extent how and why some civilizations managed to grow and prosper at the rate they did.  <br />Unfortunately Diamond&#8217;s one major flaw was his inability to omit the redundant information resulting with several dead chapters.  This includes the monotonous chapters about food production and the domestication of plants and animals.  In my opinion, these chapters were space fillers for the book.  Most of the information could have been edited to a few pages rather than reiterating the same ideas and concepts as if his readers were mindless....  I believe Diamond lost sight of who his audience was and fell to a lower level of writing.  Often I struggled to finish the aseptic pages of redundant information.  Yet, this complaint only applies to the few chapters I stated above.  Generally I was adequately satisfied with his book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in anthropology or who would like to study history from a non-traditional point of view.  I thoroughly enjoyed the chapter discussing the evolution of germs, and recommend you at least read that chapter if you choose not to read the book at all.  In my perspective, this was especially intriguing because of my science based interests.  I encourage those with patience and an open mind to read this book.  I believe there is much truth in Diamond&#8217;s theories.
B00004RF0X|4.0|a lot of people feel that this is just a kids movie, while it is a good movie for kids that is not true. I found this movie entertaining and wildly imaginative.

0780625234|4.0|this was a exellent movie, it was entertaining, had amazing visual effects and was wildly imaginative. The story has a little trouble starting up but once it does it doesn't stop. That's another point actually I found that the ending was not very good but I really can't blame the writers it is a hard movie to end. The real problem that I had with the movie was that it seemed like it was trying to make a comment about our culture or something but it really wasn't saying anything. It wasn't making acomment about our past, where we are going or were we have been. I'mnot saying that I wanted it to say something but I felt like it was trying to and it just never did. Anyway, still a exellent movie and truely a one of a kind.
B000000OQF|5.0|... but to prove it you'll have to show me a better album of this decade.  The album is solid from &quot;The Jungle&quot; to &quot;rocket Queen&quot;; one of the few albums worth listening to the whole way through.  Unlike albums thrown out today, every song on here is a favorite, compare that to a band today which are lucky to break more than two hits from the same album.
B00004WG28|1.0|What can one say about this pretty but slushy, mushy film. Hmmm..it's boring, Jodie Foster was miscast, people reacted to this film when it was released in the theatres just like Superman reacts to Kryptonite.<br />I watched this film with an open mind; I realised that it was not the usaual action-packed Chow Yun Fat flick but this was beyond painful..
B000000OSE|5.0|Actually I think both albums are awesome equally.  This one, like the colors on the cover suggest, is the brighter, and louder of the two.  <br />Not as powerful as &quot;Appetite&quot;, though The Illusions were probably the second best offering the Guns N' Roses rock n' roll machine has to offer.  Every song on here is good, some better than others (depending on personal taste of course).  My favorites are &quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot;, &quot;Don't Damn Me&quot;, &quot;Perfect Crime&quot;, and &quot;Bad Obession&quot;.  And of course the famous &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry&quot;, and &quot;Coma&quot;.  Every song on this make up one hell of an album.

Furthermore, this guy isn't steering the ship into sappy and sad waters.  Perry needs psychiatric help.  It's about time the real rockin' Journey was revived.  Good job, guys!  This CD is a MUST buy for folks who loved the classic Journey - ie Escape, Fronteirs, Departure, Infinity, etc.
B000000OQY|5.0|Fantastic album.  Again, like all of GNR's original albums, every song is worth listening to.  from beginning to end, raw Rock n' Roll.  <br />On the Flipside of the album, the last four songs are simply amazing.  Even &quot;One in a Million&quot; which deserves alot more credit.  This song is hardly offensive compared to other songs getting airplay on the radio today.
0553278398|5.0|Not only was this my first Foundation novel, but also my first Asimov. The name is the A in the A,B,C's of science fiction, and I wanted to see why this man was so touted. Well I got my lesson! 'Prelude to Foundation' was an amazing book. Though some have reported that it was boring in places, I found the 500+ page book to just flow along. Asimov sets up an interesting premise with the decaying galactic Empire, and the adventures of those who seek to save it. What pleased me the most about this book was the different aspects Asimov manages to tie together. It tackles everything from science (obviously), the nature of religion, prejudice, politics, human nature and even manages to fit in some action scenes. What surprised me even more was the tender scene in the final section. I always saw sci-fi as a cold, technology driven genre, but Asimov actually manages to create some romantic tension between the characters that ties up nicely in the end. An awesome book, and a series I will definately continue.

B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's first album is excellent in my opinion. That is the only way to describe it. Dont Panic, shiver, trouble and yellow are pure genius. The album is really refreshing and good to listen to whenever, and nobody should be dissapointed when they buy it, if they are in to coldplay's kind of music that is, but then again, people who go for upbeat, bubble gum kind of pop music could probably like it to. An excellent buy I would say, at only 10 pounds, or however much it costs in various countries.
6305508550|5.0|Milton's mumbling has to be the one reason why I have seen this about 20 times. As many have stated this film is right on the money. There has never been a film depicting the moronic office environment like OFFICE SPACE. I actually feel that this film is an important statement on corporate evil in our country. I was so enamoured by this movie that it is now my favorite 90's comedy.<br />When will the corporate masses come to realize that they are cubicle cattle, awaiting the slaughter? We act like submissive slaves or buy into the corporate philosophy and become a shell of what we thought we were as people.<br />The cold accuracy of this film is devastating. And will leave anyone with a conscience just floored. I have seen many of my &quot;smart&quot; friends lose there social integrity because of corporate misguidance.<br />Hopefully it can bring about revolution.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Summary: Chilling  Nosferatu is the first (popular one, at least)...and best...vampire film ever created. Terrific use of landscapes and dark castle corridors supported by great actors (the best being Max Schreck) sets an absolutely chilling feeling rushing through your veins!!!<br />Graf Orloc has a completely different look to him than the  other blood suckers of the Bela Legosi and Peter Cushing era. A beautiful dance of fear and unconditional romance, this film is highly recommended to ALL fans of the horror genre.
B000059QYB|4.0|The most amazing thing about this collection is the way in which these songs feel rooted to a very specific time and yet do not seem dated. Each of these sixteen songs shows that there was some genuine talent behind the somewhat cartoonish image (an image that to Idol's credit he seems to recognize is a bit cartoonish as well). The harder songs (especially \\"Flesh For Fantasy\\") still kick hard while the softer songs (particularly \\"Sweet Sixteen\\") remain truly affecting. It's also nice to see some of the less popular (though still very interesting) singles like \\"Catch My Fall\\" and \\"Don't Need A Gun\\" get their due. Even \\"Shock To The System\\" (from the ill-advised Cyberpunk album) holds it own here. Then there is an intriguing cover of \\"Don't You Forget About Me,\\" the song (written by Idol's long-time producer Keith Forsey) that made Simple Minds a house-hold name back in 1985. While a brand new song written by Idol himself would have been nice, this recording is still welcome, and it's a nifty way for Idol to salute the era in which he found his greatest fame while still showing himself to be a performer whose best days are not entirely behind him.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is one of the classic great movies of all time.  Ridley Scott is a great director and he is teamed up with Russell Crow, who gave his greatest performance to date.  A stirring, moving film with a simply fantastic score.  It's Oliver Reed's last performance and one of his greatest but it pales behind Russell Crowe.  Prepare to be deeply moved, and also to fall in love.<br />It has so much more impact on DVD than on VHS with the gorgeous visuals and surround sound.  Invest in a DVD player if you don't have one and make this DVD your first purchase.  It's my favorite, and I never tire of viewing it over and over.
B00000272N|4.0|This album is just as important as Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;. During this period music had become pretty homogeneous(Kinda like now) and needed a good kick in the rear. &quot;Man in the Box&quot; was that swift kick, but it didn't stop there. The underlying theme through this album seems rather dreary, but each song has it's own unique sound. The guys don't let you forget they have a great sense of humor either, screaming &quot;Sexual Chocolate&quot;(Reference to a band in an Eddie Murphy Movie) at the end of &quot;Real Thing&quot; still leaves me smiling right as the CD ends.
0790729628|5.0|Dark science fiction adventure set in the year 2019 about a special police-operations officer who hunts down five artificial humans in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford stars in the main role as Deckard, a \\"Bladerunner\\" policeman who specializes in hunting down \\"Replicants.\\"  The Replicants are artificial humans manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation, used for hazardous duties in off-world exploration in place of humans.  Replicants have become violently dangerous due to self-realization of their situation, resulting in bloody rebellions against their human owners.  As a result, they're declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death.  Bladerunner is about the particular case of five who return after escaping from an off-world colony, and try to penetrate the Tyrell Corporation for unknown reasons.  Deckard is retired, having lost taste for his work, and is forced by the Bladerunner unit to take the assignment of running down the five escaped replicants.    Released in 1982, the movie boasts impressive visual effects that hold up quite well with today's productions that enjoy digital animation.  The model effects create a massive Los Angeles metropolis of super skyscrapers, millions of lights, neon signs, floating blimps, and flying cars crisscrossing the impressive skyline.  Ridley Scott created an eye-catching atmosphere by looking back 40 years in history to determine the look of architecture and clothing.  The outcome is a timeless appearance that is not mottled with `80's techno-punk.  While being futuristic, it maintains a classic detective-story flavor.    The movie received mixed reviews after it first opened, probably due to audiences' expectations of another `Stars Wars' action adventure with Harrison Ford.  Instead they got a deep and dark story of a man [Deckard] hunting down artificial humans who are looking for an answer to their existence.  Midway through the story, Deckard himself begins to develop emotions for the replicants' plight.  Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who was at the height of his career in the U.S., stars as the replicants' leader Roy Batty, and turns in an exceptional performance.  Eleven years later, the Director's version was released in theaters and is one of the few movies to have enjoyed such a success, differing from the original 1982 release by excluding Harrison Ford's narrative and a `happy ending' sequence, and the addition of an unusual unicorn scene.  Curiously there are no extra features such as deleted scenes or the trailer, which is particularly interesting since it shows scenes never used in the final release.    Bladerunner is one of the better movies in the science fiction category, both in content and visual creation.  A `must own' for Sci-Fi fans.

B000056K04|5.0|This is definitely a change for the band.  The feel of the cd is different, but it still has its appeal.  While it is missing the fabulous saxophone and violin that have been present in past cd's it displays a different &quot;face&quot; of the band.  I think that it is a good thing that the band can change its sound a bit.  It shows they are not stagnating and can still produce good songs.  While I prefer earlier songs by the band, I still enjoy this cd quite a bit and would definitely reccomend it to other DMB fans.
0448060191|5.0|Little Women was an amazing book that pretty much kept me reading the entire time.  I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me!  I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that.  I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.<br />I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else.
0783110871|1.0|This is the worst DVD I've ever seen (and I sat through 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It!'). Completely unrealistic and contrived.  I will relate a few of the many things that bugged me:<br /><br />1) The fire hazard Christmas lights strung up all over the interior of the 747.  Yeah right!<br /><br />2) The rapist/killer psychopath easily overpowers about 10 FBI agents.  Sure.<br /><br />3) OH NO!  No one left to fly the plane!  (Yawn!)<br /><br />4) About 20 passengers on a 747 flight near Christmas, among 400 empty seats.  Next time you cram onto a jam packed, holiday season commercial flight, think about that.<br /><br />5) The psychopath chained to his chair easily gains the sympathy of the flight attendants.  Please.<br /><br />6) I saved the best for last.  Watch for the prolonged 'flying upside down' scene where the killer and Holly wrestle on the ceiling of the aircraft as the plane flies upside down.  This goes on for about 5 minutes.  Then watch the killer stroll up to first class, sit down, and casually pick up an UNSPILLED MARTINI!  That scene is so sloppy.  But that's Turbulence in a nutshell.
0790729628|5.0|Directed by Ridley Scott, possibly the best director in Hollywood, Blade Runner: The Director's cut is an outstanding medley of action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense.   Robots have been taken to a new level - Nexus 6 Generation Robots called &quot;replicants&quot;, which outmatch humans in strength and ability and equal in intelligence, but lack one human quality - emotions.  They were used for &quot;slave labor&quot; to work in places too hazardous for humans.  However, replicants after a few years begin to develop their own emotions, which causes them to rebel against their masters.  Special cops, called blade runners, were assigned to exterminate criminal replicants.  Eventually replicants were declared illegal on earth, and were banished to a shuttle in space.   LA, 2017.  Rick Deckard, (Harrison Ford) a retired blade runner, is forced to &quot;retire&quot; five replicants that have escaped from the shuttle, but winds up falling for one, Rachael. (Sean Young) Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads the other three replicants to find their creator, Eldon Tyrell, to expand their short four-year life span.   Incredible action scenes, dark, brooding noir, creeping suspense, and excellent sci-fi, Blade Runner: The Director's Cut will please fans of any of these genres.  The Director's Cut offers production notes, subtitles, added character developement, the original ending, a unicorn dream sequence, and the deletion of unnecessary scenes and the annoying voice-overs.  Plus, it is digitally restored to excellent picture and sound quality.   Some &quot;sensitive&quot; viewers might find the plot and noir atmosphere cold, but action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense fans will enjoy it very much.   With stunning special effects, incredible cinematography, compelling plot, and rich, incredible characterizations (esp. Rutger Hauer), I strongly recommend Blade Runner: The Director's Cut to action/sci-fi fans.

0060278242|4.0|Lirael continues the unique fantasy world woven by Garth Nix in Sabriel. Like Sabriel, Lirael is filled with intriguing and real characters and a story that grabs and keeps your attention. In some ways, I feel that Lirael is more of a set-up for the sequel because Lirael focuses somewhat more on character than action, especially at the beginning. But the characters are so real and so interesting that you want to keep reading just to learn more about the characters themselves. While the focus of the book might be slightly more on character development, there is also definitely story that keeps one reading. I hope that in Abhorsen, Nix can continue his excellent balance of plot and character development and not focus totally on plot (there is a lot of story left to be told!).      I have thoroughly enjoyed both Sabriel and Lirael and would highly recommend them to readers of ANY age. Children and adults alike will find kindred spirits in these characters. Nix's world is creative and unique and his stories are worth reading multiple times. If you enjoyed Sabriel, you will definitely want to read Lirael.      How long do I have to wait for Abhorsen??
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's famous novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?&quot;, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to retire five genetically engineered syborgues, known as &quot;Replicants&quot;. In 1982, the director, Ridley Scott, found himself at the center of a storm around his production of Blade Runner. After clashes with studio executives over the film's complex content and downbeat finale, Scott added a voiceover narration and a more positive ending. But &quot;Blade Runner&quot; fell victim to negative reviews and a poor box office. It wasn't until the early 1990s that the director's cut, the final version, was finally released on videocassette, and the film was recognized as a science-fiction masterpiece...<br />   Born in England in 1937, Ridley Scott were one of the most promising directors of the late 1970s with films like &quot;The Duellists&quot; (1977) that won the Jury Prize for Best First Feature at the Cannes Film Festival and, above all, &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), the first episode of the famous tetralogy. Directing &quot;Blade Runner&quot; in 1982, he certainly realised his career masterpiece. About twenty years later, we can affirm he is a great and an eclectic director who has tackled many kinds of film as the historical epic (&quot;Gladiator&quot; / 2000 / five Academy Awards, one of whom was the best director award for Scott), the historic film (&quot;1492 : Conquest of Paradise&quot; / 1992), the road movie (&quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; / 1991) or also the science-fiction film (&quot;Blade Runner&quot; / &quot;Alien&quot;).    Blade Runner's actors and actresses are also pretty good ones especially Harrison Ford. This one acted in about 50 movies : among them, the most famous are &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; (1981, 1984 and 1989), &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986) or also &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993). Though they are not pretty famous, the actor Rutger Hauer who acted the leader of the five replicants and the actresses Sean Young who acted an android and Daryl Hannah, a replicant, are also exceptionnal in this movie.<br />   I suggest you a short summary of Blade Runner : in a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard is a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, a cop who specialises in terminating replicants. Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when five replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired. <br />   In order to conclude, I will try to make a review of this marvellous masterpiece named &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.  On top of being well-directed and well-adapted from this great book of Dick, this movie can enjoy a splendid original soundtrack by the famous composer Vangelis, who also arranged the soundtracks of &quot;the Chariots of Fire&quot; (he won an Oscar) and &quot;1492&quot;, that consists mainly in jazz and blues illustrating perfectly the dark atmosphere of Scott's movie. Concerning the dialogues, the lasts lines of the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) are engraved on my memory forever : <br />&quot;Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. I've seen things... you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams... glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost... in time... like tears... in the rain.&quot;<br />   Moreover, the special effects are exceptionnal especially in the opening credits : the best sci-fi scene I have ever seen (tied with the ending of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;) ! The texts, the apocalyptic pan of Los Angeles then the interrogation ... I think that I was very clear about this film. Watch it ! Everybody can watch it because it questions what it is to be human and why life is so precious.

0790749815|5.0|This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that \\"The Master of Suspense\\" stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).<br />Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else.  Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.<br />It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one.  However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter.  Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior.  Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.<br />Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter and filled with Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes.  The crop duster pursuit and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore are classic Hitch.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he wasrefused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original, earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.<br />The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in \\"On The Waterfront\\", but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.<br />I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (\\"Psycho\\", \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Rear Window\\").  I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question.  Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.
B000002NIW|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time because each song is great on its own, but can flow into each other to create one wonderful song. I only know three other albums that can do that, the two closest to Around the Fur being AEnima by Tool and Antichrist Superstar by Marilyn Manson (yes, the Deftones DO sound like Manson a little bit). The best songs on here are &quot;Be Quiet and Drive,&quot; &quot;Headup,&quot; and &quot;mx,&quot; but like I said, all the songs are great. Buy this now, and you will not be disappointed.
0553213105|5.0|i am fourteen years old.  i am an avid reader.  i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times.  my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good.  i just started reading for the heck of it.  i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have.  but, anyways, the book is excellent.  elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel.  she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female.  mr. darcy is a man.  proud yet sweet in his own way.  they are perfect.  mrs. bennet is a character of her own.  lydia is amusing.  the whole book is great.  it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book.  it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels.  it is certainly sweet.  it allows you to relate to characters in your own way.  maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything.  but it definitely worth it.  if you haven't read it you must.  if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it.  i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it.  it is just a satisfying read.
B000002UAU|5.0|I think that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the Beatles' best album. I first heard this album when I was six and after I heard it I wanted to hear other Beatles albums like Help! and A Hard Day's Night (both great albums). There is not even one standard song in Sgt. Pepper's, every song is great.
0451526295|4.0|this book was interesting enough.  i love jane austen.  my two personal faves were pride and prejudice and emma.  this was interesting, the plot was intriguing and everything.  i just thought that way too much was going on throughout the book.  it was event after event after event.  it was definitely suspenseful.  the end was satisfying enough.  fanny is not the best of jane austen's heroines. my favorite character was sir thomas.  he was cool.  i enjoy reading books of this sort generally.  fanny could have been more interesting.  i don't get why she was so totally in love with edmund the whole time that he was in love with mary crawford.  it is a good read if you have time.  it took me a month or so to read it because i had to read in the few spare moments i have aside from school reading and other work.  i do recommend it to people who enjoy jane austen and those who are willing to take a good chunk of time out of their day to read.
B000002N9L|4.0|If you look inside the booklet that comes with \\"Chaos & Disorder\\", you will find that Prince had recorded these songs \\"4 private use only\\". Since he still had to record another album for Warner Brothers, he gave them these songs. The album is about 40 to 45 minutes long and is just great! The list of songs is as follows:<br />1)Choas & Disorder-This great track starts the album. You can hear Rosie Gaines singing with him. Guitars and \\"scratches\\" dominate this track.<br />2)I Like It There-This song makes me laugh! Take heed to the parental advisory label!!:)A great song with a fast pace.<br />3)Dinner With Delores-Another funny song. The tempo and the instruments used make the song sound kinda Chinese...this is one of my favorites.<br />4)The Same December-Prince being preachy...not very good.<br />5)Right the Wrong-Another kinda preachy song...the horns make the song pretty good. Listen for Prince at the end...\\"I'm six feet in the graaaaaaaaave!!!\\"<br />6)Zannalee-The obligatory blues song. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me.<br />7)I Rock, Therefore I Am-The best song on this album, and the longest. Two raps and great vocals make this a standout. My favorite track.<br />8)Into The Light-Boring and dumb. Why did they put this after such a good song?<br />9)I Will-Another dumb song. Why, Prince, why??<br />10)Dig U Better Dead-This song just has a great beat. The thump dominates this song. Another favorite.<br />11)Had U-The less than 2-minute ending song. Very funny!!<br />This album is a MUST for any Prince fan. The other album like this, \\"The Vault\\" doesn't come CLOSE. Enjoy this one. Prince rules (pun intended)!!
B00004XOWM|3.0|It's been some time since I've got this cd, and I still hear Limp Bizkit's songs on the radio which reminds me of why I even bought it in the first place. Well, songs like rollin' and my way are good and catchy, but I think they ripped me off. The rest of the cd is mostly filler and different versions of their older stuff, esp 'outro'. What a waste of track space. I liked three dollar bill y'all and sig other much better. Mr. Durst, change is fine but stick with what you're good at. Appealing to MTV instead of focusing on the music has made me a little sick. Filler sucks.
0684853523|4.0|The numerous reviews published by other readers were all accurate and informative analysis and revealed the literary talent that Stephen King demonstrates with each book he writes. The most enjoyable aspect I found in King's book &quot;On Writing: . . .&quot; was the way he often uses his ability to bring the reader into the story, but instead of being a sideline observer of the action, the reader now seems to be in a one-on-one conversation with King.  An intimate and candid interview that makes the reader feel like he's sitting in the living room first listening to King discuss his life and then explaining techniques on writing.<br />The experience was a better method of meeting King 'in person' than any two minute pass-by during a book signing event.  It was clear how King brings many of his life experiences into his writing and with the number of times and to the extent he spoke about his recent accident, it wont be surprising to find allusions to vehicle/pedestrian accidents in future novels (which I am now discovering in his latest release of &quot;The Dreamcatcher&quot;.)  In short, &quot;On Writing: . . .&quot; was another great investment for my King collection.

B00003CWTI|3.0|Positives of this movie: Great acting. Great music. Great charactors. Interesting stories. Lots of surprises.<br />Negatives: For being such a long movie, leaves way too many loose ends! <br />Huh?: I didn't see how the &quot;freek accident&quot; stories the cop was telling at the beginning of the movie paralled the other stories in this movie. The characters were all related somehow, but their family problems had next to nothing to do with the other characters. <br />What in the world was that black kid rapping about? What did the man tied up in the closet have to do with the rest of the movie? <br />Were everyone's problems simply solved by frogs falling from the sky? Why didn't anyone even mention the frogs falling from the sky after it happened? What happened to the quiz show kid and the quiz show host? <br />It was a fun movie to follow, but I can't begin to understand what it was all about!
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever produced.  Every scene of this movie provided the glue that kept you tight in your seat.  Every aspect of the architectural lay out of Rome and the Coliseum were perfectly recreated.  There is absolutely no flaws as every detail is perfectly depicted.  This movie's script is the perfect story and as far as the acting goes, Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were brilliant.  Crowe, well deserved his Oscar and Phoenix should have won &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; in my opinion.  By the closing scene of the movie I absolutely despised Phoenix, so his task as the evil emperor of Rome was succesfully completed.  The DVD itself is full of special features as a second disc is included with the feature disc to better contain all of the extra footage.  It is very interesting to take a glimpse at how Rome was recreated and how other things developed as well.  In all you get an extremely great deal as Gladiator includes the amazing feature presentation followed up by special features on a second disc.  This is a must for your DVD library, so I recommend that you purchase it in the nearest future.
B000009QO6|5.0|Glenn Danzig, In my humble opinion, is one of the best damn singers of all time. As Metallica calls him: &quot;The Heavy Elvis.&quot; The songs on this album are continued from his band Samhain, which is basiclly the same band as Danzig (The Band started in '84, after leaving The Misfits). Anyway, this is a great metal album, conbining the horrific lyrics of The Misfits (the BEST punk band ever!!) and the Metal riffs of Samhain and making an original sound...mostly because of their original singer, Glenn. The best songs are &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; &quot;Am I Demon&quot; and &quot;Mother.&quot; If you like Metal, or punk, or whatever, buy this damn CD.
B000059MEK|3.0|When people state that this Album &quot;sucks&quot;, they are in some ways right. This album was below my expectations as I highly anticipated it and when i heard it i was severely disspointed. It DEFINATELY could cut out the vocoder effects or vocals entirely for that matter and jsut go back to their Homework days.
B00000ILE7|4.0|I can't understand why people think this film is terrible.  Did you really expect Newt and Hicks to survive?  Their presence in this film would be out-of-place.  Believe me, the Alien series had to end somehow (temporarily of course). Alien 3 has terrific performances by Weaver, Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, and basically everyone else.  The musical score by  Elliot Goldenthal is powerful and moody.  The film has a suitably melancholy, apocalyptic tone throughout.  Is it depressing at times?  Of course, but it suits this film well.  It's an excellent addition to the Alien series.
0786882212|5.0|I didn't buy the Screenplay for a need to understand the movie persay, however it was a definate treat. Sometimes you just don't want to read the entire book but you want to visualize the movie in your head. The screenplay is perfect for this. I recommend it for any Trainspotting fan.
B0000508U6|5.0|I'm a MAJOR supporter of the little bands. I've been tracking and watching Coldplay for a few years now and am so happy that their success has started to grow. They've been on SNL and have a hit song Yellow! They're awesome!Prob. one of the newest bands worth watching and buying their CDs. Yellow, Shiver, Sparks, Don't Panic (aka Beautiful World.) are all GREAT songs. (and so are their other songs!)If you only buy one CD this year make it Parachutes!! Love ya lots guys!! ...  Bye bye..
0425107469|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed The Watchers, (and who wouldn't)  Should be aware of the continuing thread of that story appearing in Fear Nothing and Seize The Night.  Another super smart dog, other intelligence enhanced animals with demonic tendencies, even a brief cameo apperance by the Outsider. Anyone who has read the Watchers will enjoy picking up the story in Fear Nothing and Seize The Night.
B0000508U6|5.0|I love this album. Ever since it was given to me, I have not been able to stop listening to it! The introspective, loving lyrics and the calming, oceanic music soothes my gypsy soul. This is one of the most wicked albums ever!
0312932081|4.0|Ender Wiggins was the character that could attract any child to want to live his life.  As he housed the skills of strength and smarts to save the earth he became an automatic superhero that you had to root for.  I feel this book should be on the list for younger students everywhere.  It is a novel that could attract so many students to a world of reading for fun.  By Ender being this military genious, takes us into a world of imagination that we can't get enough of.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant albums EVER. It is completely insane, completely beautiful, and completely original. There is no /one else like Radiohead, and no other album like OK Computer! Righteous!
B000001Y5X|3.0|&quot;Portrait of an american Family&quot; is a decent debut, but not much more. Maybe due to the major Drug Issues the Band ( fromer Guitarist Brad Stewart was kicked out because of his overwhelming heroin habits and replaced by Twiggy Ramirez ) faced at that Time, Manson's genius seems not yet developed.<br />&quot;Portrait&quot; sounds like NIN meets 80's Metal for most of the time. It hasn't the power, agression and philosophical undertones &quot;Antichrist superstar&quot; had, nor does it contain any of the supreme songwriting talent the band had on &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and &quot;Holy Wood&quot;. It's basically a growning Band that hasn't yet developed a definite personality. <br />The tracks stand on their own, not serving any connection like on the future albums. This album also suffers from an awkard production. Seems like Trent Renzor saw it coming that Manson is going to kick more a. than he ever did, so he took action that at least his debut was sounding very cheap. And it does. Ramirez shines as usual, but the guitars sound more like listening to a jukebox. Manson's vocal abilities suffer from the production too. <br />His lyrics are quiet good however, touching various issues like drugs (Dope Hat), the hypocretical pro-life (get your gunn) or painful sex (Sweet Tooth). But he still remains under his later abbilities. A handful songs are quiet good ( Lunchbox, Organ Grinder, Get your Gunn, Dope Hat, Dogma ) but others are pretty bad ( My Monkey, Sweeth Tooth, Snake Eyes and Sissies ). <br />Overall, &quot;Portrait&quot; remains a decent debut, but it doesn't even compare to his soon-to-come masterpieces. Essential for Manson fans who got his name tattoed on their chest, anybody else should listen before buying.
B00000JPH6|4.0|If one can't see that this movie promotes the squish-head movement known as 'New-Age', then I doubt anything I say will be helpful.  Just compare the Urhu (Weaver, Sand Painter, Herbalist, Musician, Story Teller, etc.) in their caves with the Skeksis (General, Priest, Scientist, Gourmand, etc) in their cathedral-like castle.  Whose side is the film on? The castle even has what looks like choir stalls in the throne room.  Anti-Christian perhaps?  And just what are 'natural wizards&quot;; were there any unnatural wizards?<br />Anyway, I don't mind since the Skeksis are the most interesting characters in the film.  I was disappointed when they merged with Urhu at the end.  I'd rather have seen them enjoying a good Gelfling stew.<br />'The Dark Crystal' is one of my favorites, and I'm looking forward to a visit by my niece and nephew visit so I can play it for them.  The producers have provided a excellent DVD which is described in detail both above and below.  I deducted a point for the tiresome narration at the beginning, and voice-overs by Jen, but this is film for kids, so I guess excessive explication is necessary.<br />Now where can I get me some Garfim?

B00003CXPD|4.0|I received this disc today and watched the film for the first time. It affected me in so many ways that I can't really describe them here. I can only say that I envy Billy Elliot for his precocious passion. The conflict between his desire to be a dancer and his dedication to his family stirs a deep sympathy.<br />I'd give this film five stars except for the intrusive pop music. It might have been all right for versimilitude to the time and place, but there's altogether too much of it. With its...sentiments and schmaltzy lyrics, pop is unsuited for a film that aims at such profound emotions. I'd say that hearing Marc Bolan along with Chopin and Tchaikovsy is like drinking Coke mixed with a fine wine, but that would be unfair to Coca-Cola. I suppose the producers wanted to broaden their film's appeal to include a certain type of audience. Anyway, wasn't T-Rex extinct by '84? The 'music' over the closing credits - although not by Bolan - is particularly offensive.
6304493681|2.0|Ghost in the Shell: it's been called the next Akira, and one of the best anime films of all time. Well, I'm a huge anime fan, and I couldn't stand this movie. My god, was it ever BORING! I swear, I fell asleep watching this. But to be fair, the DVD does have some good special features. But please, PLEASE, view it before you buy it.
078401020X|5.0|The &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; positions regarding this movie have been pretty well staked out over time.  But for all the volumes that have been written about it, nobody ever seems to recognize the film for what it REALLY is -- a loving homage to Alfred Hitchcock from a loyal disciple.  Watch it from this perspective and &quot;see&quot; it for the first time.  (Had HE lived to see it, I say the master could ONLY have been impressed!)
B0000508U6|5.0|After scooping a best album of the year award, and bringing us several stunning tracks, I felt it was time to experience Coldplay's debut album for myself. The album combines chilling acoustic beats with some heavy guitar material. It is highly addictive and includes the hit singles: 'Yellow', 'Shiver', 'Trouble' and their latest release 'Don't panic'.
B00003CXPD|5.0|i thought this movie was the most amazing thing ever. it seriously makes u want to get up and dance and just jump around... the music is wonderful and i am for sure buying the soundtrack! i loved this movie so much that i had a Billy Elliot party for me and all my friends we watched the movie then learned the dance moves. if this movie doesnt touch u then i dont know what will!
B00000IGGA|5.0|I always loved Mr Waits' early music - Closing Time, Heart of Saturday Night,Small Change etc, and then I went and bought Mule Variations and I was hooked.  Every single track is outstanding. Big in Japan and Filipino Box Spring Hog are a blast, the blues beauty of Get Behind The Mule and Lowside of the Road, the tearful brilliance of Pony, Picture in a Frame, Take it With Me and Georgia Lee, the eerie wonder of What's He Building in There. . . . a classic Waits album.
B000002KKD|5.0|If this record doesn't get you on your feet, you might be dead.<br />Like Sgt. Pepper's, this record left me cold the first time I heard it--but it bugged me.  The second time, I started to get the message.  The third time, I was hooked, and have been ever since.<br />Play it loud--real loud!
B000002KBH|5.0|This is one great album and possibly the Dead's finest hour. \\"Box Of Rain\\" is heartfelt beyond words, \\"Friend Of The Devil\\" is such a folk classic that even Dylan covers it in concert, \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" is Weir's best composition ever... I can go on.<br />Strange, really, that such a magnificent live band turned out to make such a fantastic studio record. I personally hold it as the Dead's best album ever, though \\"Live/Dead\\" is a very close second.<br />Even if \\"Attics Of My Life\\" is a bit sub-standard, it cannot hurt the complete and utter brilliance of the rest of the tracks.<br />My personal favourite on the album has to be \\"Ripple\\". Is that one good song or what? Just wonderful. The wonderful melody, Hunter's beautiful lyrics, Garcia's gorgeous singing, Grisman's rippling mandolin and that soaring coda. An instant classic.<br />Watch out for \\"Brokedown Palace\\" as well - that one grows on you.<br />If you are new to the Dead, this is the place to start. If you already know the Dead and haven't picked up \\"American Beauty\\" - what are you waiting for?
