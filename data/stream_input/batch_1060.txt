0312600844|1.0|Having read and somewhat liked Franzen's The Corrections in 2001, I was willing to spend time on Freedom and found myself to be disappointed.   I question whether I was reading the same book that received consistently glowing reviews from many of my favorite sources (i.e. New York Times, Salon, Time).  Freedom is merely a mainstream book costumed as a literary novel (some critics called it \\"The Great American Novel\\").    Among other problems, the author struggles with the female voice of Patty Berglund.  Patty's opening confessional may have been Franzen's attempt to disguise his inability to present an authentic female voice.   As other Amazon reviewers have noted, there was not an apparent change of voice once her autobiographical section ended.    The portraits of most of the book's characters and relationships were unconvincing. Walter's development was not believable given his passive nature at the beginning of the novel.  I did not buy the fact that at the end of the novel Walter decides to ponder whether or not to permit Patty back into his life while she shivers for a time in the cold on his porch.  We never really know why he went from a passive, somewhat caring person to this misogynistic character by novel's end.  I wasn't sure if the heavy-handed way that Franzen conveyed Joey's incident with his wedding ring was intended to be funny or satirical.  It was not amusing and a weak attempt at symbolism.  The overabundance of pop culture references were unnecessary unless they are included to help us all believe that the author is hip and with it.     Finally, some critics have referred to Freedom as Franzen's War and Peace.  I would wager that, unlike Tolstoy's novel which we are reading 150 years later, we will not be reading Franzen's novel 150 years from now.  I'll take Updike and Roth any day.
B00499K9E0|5.0|After 5 minutes I was hooked. After 10 minutes I realized that this is the best television show that I have ever seen. The actors are perfectly cast. I'm not convinced that they are actors. They ARE Watson & Holmes. The plot was riveting. With a delicious twist. The music is marvelous. I've never been to England, so the street shots of London were exciting. I forgot it was a tv show. It was actually like watching part 2 of the Sherlock movie with Robert Downey, Jr. Guy Ritchie is the star of the show. I have subscribed for the season. Must go now. Episode 2 is waiting for me! And I am not from Moldova, Republic of.  Amazon refuses to acknowledge Maryland.
B00004XMTJ|2.0|We were disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  It skips randomly while in play.  The DVD player built into the Macbook Pro displays a message that there is \\"corrupt material\\" during play, and the next time we play it, this happens at a different random spot.  I've tried it in another DVD player and get the same results without the message--just skipping.  I should have sent it back.

0312600844|2.0|I must admit to being a bit premature in this review, but it's taken me over a week to get through 250 pages, and I doubt I will finish the book.  I didn't read the Corrections, so I don't have the revisionist's complaints.  MY only complain is that it is dull.  Who wants to read about the ruminations of a handful of entitled, narcissistic folks who are having difficulty getting along with each other?  I see enough of this every day.  I generally enjoy Oprah's picks.  This seems to have been picked based on criteria other than entertainment value.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|DEATH RACE delivers pretty much exactly what it sets out to deliver.  If you're expecting anything like convincing character development (or ANY character development), a credible plot or incisive dialogue...you have not read the description of the film or seen any of the previews.  If, however, you are looking for a film with lots of car chase action, gory deaths and more car chase action with a touch of gunfire...then DEATH RACE fits that bill.    It's just a couple of years in the future, but apparently, our economy has gotten worse, and our prison population has exploded.  Run by private companies, the penal system has developed a novel way to make money.  They have inmates chase each other around a lengthy track in the middle of the prison island in souped-up, heavily modified and armored vehicles.  A race to the death.  Millions upon millions of Americans pay up to $99 to get live streams of these races.  (I did the math...apparently each race must gross somewhere between $4.5 and $7 BILLION!)    Jason Statham is framed for the murder of his wife, just so he can be imprisoned and compelled to race.  If he can win, he will be freed and can see his infant daughter again.  You see, Statham was a famous race car driver at one time, but fell on hard times.  Now he, and his rag-tag team of mechanics (led by Ian McShane), must wage battle against the most ferociously resilient moving vehicles ever devised.  And Statham also wants to find out who killed his wife and how the warden (Joan Allen...I hope she received a HUGE paycheck for lowering herself to this junk) is involved.    I will give the movie credit for not skimping on the chase scenes.  They are lengthy, noisy, fast, crazily edited, violent and satisfying on a visceral level.  Many lower budget action films will promise lots of action, but have lots of scenes of endless talking instead.  DEATH RACE gives us a quick, brutal opening race and then three more lengthy races to enjoy during the duration of the film.  The action in the races defies the laws of physics, of course...but there are inventive moments of mayhem.    Jason Statham, who can be fun (THE BANK JOB showed he actually has skills.  The CRANK films show he has a sense of humor) is fairly flat in this film.  Allen plays her part exactly the same throughout.  McShane chews the scenery, but he comes closest to making something of the sketchy dialogue and character he is given.  Tyrese Gibson, as a rival driver delivers yet another flat, uninteresting performance.      I'm actually thinking this film should be 3.5 stars.  It is, on any critical or analytical level, pure junk.  But with your sound system turned to 11 and your brain turned to about 2...it features well-made violence and chaos which can be enjoyed for 90 guilty-pleasure minutes.    (By the way, I haven't seen Roger Corman's DEATH RACE 2000 in decades...but I think the two films bear little resemblance.  Corman gets a producing credit here...but honestly, the film has more in common with THE RUNNING MAN than Corman's cheesy classic.)
B001PO53IO|5.0|I had not watched the series until I purchased it but have always been a Star Wars fan.  I choose not to pick apart the story or its relevance to the Star Wars universe but greatly appreciate its value to a new generation of science fiction enthusiasts.  I watched the entire series without stopping and have shared episodes with friends.<br /><br />The series could be a little violent to some parents so I do warn to that regard.  There are some valuable lessons to young viewers.  The stories are excellent and I look forward to Season 2.<br /><br />The packaging is very well done and feels like a collectors item instead of standard packaging.  The case cannot be fastened closed and may be susceptible to little hands.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B001DJLCRC|4.0|The key to all the rationalizations is cancer.  Is it terminal?  Who can say?  It's Stage 3A.  Doesn't sound good.  And Walt teaches high school--ergo, he makes so little money that he has to moonlight at a car wash.  His health \\"insurance\\", like most US health \\"insurance\\" prior to ObamaCare, is really great until the day comes that you get really sick.  Then you're screwed.  And usually you lose everything and then you die, leaving your family penniless, homeless, and buried under a mountain of debt.<br /><br />So this is supposed to give Walt permission to do a number of bad things, like, 1) traffic in meth, 2) steal lab equipment from his employer, a public school, and, 3) turn a blind eye when an innocent person is accused of the theft and ends up getting fired for \\"having a record.\\"<br /><br />Well, you know, it's all very nice to act like you're a real citizen with upstanding morals and family values, but then comes the day when it actually costs you something to live by those values, and put principle into practice, and that's when most people stumble.<br /><br />And Walt falls flat on his butt.<br /><br />And the fall is made blatantly apparent when Walt refuses a helping hand from someone with the resources to help.  What's the justification for that?  Well, maybe Walt's just too proud.  Because apparently it's better to stand on your own like a real man, even if that means committing multiple felonies and maybe spending the rest of your life in prison.<br /><br />But, really, what's the big deal?  It's TV.  And it's not NYPD Blue, where the lead character hears a fellow officer admit to murder, and does nothing about it.  And it's not the Shield, where one cop murders another cop, and apparently this passes for good wholesome TV entertainment.  And it's certainly not the Sopranos, where you know going in that at least half the characters are murderous thugs who really quite enjoy committing every kind of mayhem.<br /><br />Well, yeah, that's kind of the point.  This guy Walt is a school teacher.  His excuse is slim and none.  And I'm not even bringing up the worst thing he does, with its own special rationalization, because it's one little conundrum the script really doesn't resolve, except by putting the character into an absurd position, where, in effect, Walt invites another character to provide the justification.<br /><br />So, really, while Breaking Bad IS entertaining, bear in mind that it's more of a satire than a \\"drama,\\" in that it's \\"...holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn.\\"<br /><br />And, uhhh...yeah.  Seven episodes.  Keep that in mind when you're looking at prices.cuse is slim and none.

B003VIW8DK|5.0|After the last few Ferry albums, I didn't expect to receive an album reminding me the old days of the Roxy Music and Ferry from almost 30 years ago. It feels as if the album itself is a continuum of the great Avalon, but with the time taken into account. Most of the pieces are there. Ferry took into account his age, and soften his approach, which is nice since it illustrates the maturity clearly without the need to hide it. If he had tried to make it look more like the old Roxy records, a highly possible failure would have disappointed many fans. With Olympia that is not the case. And going from the faster to the slower, the album paces itself nicely.    The only negative I can think of is the many moments I can make connection to different songs from the past. I can feel the inspirations, and I am not sure they all belong to him. But, after a few listening, that effect loosens, and I can finally focus solely on the album at hand.     In any case, if you really are a fan of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry, I don't think you will be disappointed. This album will be a worthy addition to your Roxy collection.
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever and you can check out the many other DVD reviews for raves about it.  So, I will simply say that the availability of Almost Famous with its fabulous soundtrack on Blu ray is an overdue delight.      A great transfer with great sound.  Available as an import with this listing.  My seller was very helpful in reassuring me that region free applies to Blu ray and backed this with a guarantee to return (ERK Media btw - highly recommended as a result of their excellent help).  Well, it plays without any problems and is beautiful looking and sounding.      In short, if you love this movie, you will enjoy it more than ever on Blu ray!
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Who else but Mark Knopfler could author such a wonderful group of songs about ordinary people ? I've listened to this recording MANY times . Much as i love ALL \\"the Straits\\" discs , song for song , i feel this one (their last as a group) is their best . Other , better writers , have told you ALL that you need to know . As WAS and REMAINS most often the case , ROLLING STONE magazine and their ilk simply got it wrong . No surprise there . Superb and brilliant . Almost flawless . Hear it somehow .
1416583432|3.0|First of all, most dog lovers will enjoy this book because of how it brings the human into the world of the dog and makes us reconsider all the details of the world from his/her point of view. That said, there are numerous basic scientific flaws in the book, which, while they aren't central to the material, are glaring enough to make me wonder what other flaws the book may contain that i didn't catch. Examples: stating that insects are arachnids (p.20) as well as using \\"family\\" and \\"class\\" interchangeably; and stating that an increase of 10 decibels is a hundredfold rise in sound strength (it is tenfold, as 10 decibels = 1 bel, and the bel is a base-10 logarithmic scale). Maybe she just needed a better editor. I hope her future endeavors will be more carefully inspected before they are published, because such errors make me take all of the scientific reporting in the book with a grain of salt. Other than that, i was left wishing for more specifics about the how and what of dogs' body language, expressions, and movements. The author frequently stated that these things have nuanced meanings, which she gleaned from her hours of painstaking review of her video footage; i only wish she had shared more details of her hard-earned findings. I would love to know better how to communicate with my beloved canine. I was glad that the author did take the opportunity to dispel several common myths about dog training and behavior. I did enjoy the author's often endearing language, such as when she describes that dogs \\"see [humans] as fine general-purpose tools.\\" Overall, the book is a wonderful blend of perspectives on genealogy, history, and sociology of what it means to be a dog. The book succeeded in amplifying my already high regard for my dog -- and in encouraging me to think of myself as a human in a dog's world rather than the other way around.

The story was overall boring..
B004132I4S|5.0|I've been a Sufjan Stevens fan for the past 7 years, so I've been eagerly awaiting a new full length album from him since Illinois. Upon first listen I thought there were a couple really good songs on Age of Adz, while the rest was mostly okay, but not quite polished material. I've been listening to the album for a few weeks now and I've grown to really enjoy it. I had the great fortune of attending a Sufjan Stevens concert last week, and it really helped make the CD click. Watching the band perform these pieces live gives you a real respect and understanding of the seemingly initial chaos of some of the songs. If you like Sufjan's past material and you enjoy electronica at all, then please give this album a chance!
B002ZG99CC|4.0|This was a good movie and the acting was good.. I did like the boy who was The Karate kid and thought he was a better actor than Ralph M.  The only thing. the story was almost exactly like the original story...if make a remake, why don't they make an original one? Mr Miyagi was nowhere as good as the original one...but i did find it interesting and enjoyed watching it...It was also set in China, instead of California.
B000002HMH|3.0|I once purchased this album a long time ago thinking this is my first Metallica album , considering I was like 13, and my brother loved Metallica and told me they were the kings, it was a magical moment.  When I got home and popped it in I thought it was awesome, but remember I was 13 and really never even heard their earlier stuff.                     As time went on I kept this disc but not even knowing what Metallica was capable of I even got bored of this album.  I think like two years later I finally got And Justice For All, and the black album, between the two of these albums, not even being the best example of Metallicas true potential, I was like WTF?!?!?!?  In turn I ended up getting rid of this album and never looked back..... That is until about 10 years later.                     Fast forward to 2010, The music scene is starting to bore me, all my favorite bands just released all their new albums, i enthusiastically purchased and played to death all of these albums, which include Chimaira, Devildriver, God Forbid, Lamb of God, All That Remains, etc.  Obviously my tastes have gone a touch heavier than Metallica, however I was starting to find this taste for old metal.  The things i listened to as a kid, but got rid of, im starting to find a true interest in it.  I dont know if its the nostalgia or just supplementing my boredom with something from the past, either way im starting to find beauty in the things i discarded years ago.  Load was definitely one of the first albums that came to mind when i started this project.  Im listening to this album right now and the only thing I can think is, its not that bad.                     I think the truth is a lot of fans waited so long for this album, it was like a kick in the junk when it finally came out.  For any new fans it only takes a few minutes to find some old metallica and realize this doesnt measure up.  For any true Metallica fan they will defend this album and all others that didnt sound like early metallica, fans of metallicas edge and not necessarily them will discard this without a moments hesitation.                     For all you out there that hear this and toss it, I recommend you keep it around, and try it out later, honestly now that we finally recieved a record from Metallica worth while, its actually kind of fun to hear this album if just for sh*ts and giggles.  Give it another chance you might just find its not as terrible as you thought, and just give it a spin whenever your in the mood.
0312600844|4.0|I would recommend this book.  Since it is currently an Oprah book and very highly profiled, as a reader I think it is important to read this book.  While there are certain sections that I didn't enjoy, I felt that the book was very readable and provoked a lot of discussion.  The characters were very interesting and the plot moved along quickly.    This is very difficult to summarize as there are so many sub plots and so many characters.  I would not consider this a vacation book but would recommend to book clubs and for people who are interested in being current with what is available to read.    Everyone in my book club finished the book and our discussion was lengthy and provocative.
0307454541|5.0|The first 50 pages or so are a little confusing or slow but keep with it.  I am so glad that I did.  I loved the characters and the plot.  There are many twists and turns but no matter how I tried to figure out the ending I couldn't do it.  This is a terrific book to read anywhere--great  escape novel!!!<br /><br />Others have adequately given a summary so I won't do that but I will encourage you to read this book.  Everyone that I know who started it really loved it and continued on to read the other 2 books that come after.

B001AQO3QA|3.0|When i bought this long awaited box, i was very happy that the first two aliens had been restored so well.  Picture is clear and really above all other editions.  But then came Alien 3.  Starting from there, the things were not as bright...  Average image quality, i was disappointed.  And worst of all, Alien 4.  The image quality is so bad that i was wondering if it was really a BR or the raw copy of the DVD version.  Definitely NOT an \\"anthology\\" version for this one. Perhaps we will get a reworked version in 10 years or so ?
B0036TGSRG|4.0|This is a well made film by Roman Polanski which seems to be cross between an old Alfred Hitchock movie and an Oliver Stone political thriller (JFK). This film underscores conscioulsy or unconsciously how world leaders are made in the 20th centutry, e.g. groomed and bred by secret societies-clandestine services in order to serve a geo-political agenda. You might also like \\"The Good Shepherd\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate.\\"
B00164KYV4|2.0|I wasn't drawn to this movie by its own charms, I just wanted to see how they translated the advice book to the screen.  Given that one of the book's central theses is that life is not a rom-com, my expectations were fairly low.    It's a competent effort, but for me the casting was a bit dull, the writing fell short, and I wasn't engaged by any of the relationships explored.  It felt like a quick knock-off of \\"Love Actually\\".
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|When I was about 19 I saw SOM in a real movie theater palace - one where you has reserved ticket seats. These theaters had upgraded their sound to handle the 6 track audio and expensive Todd-Ao projectors, screens and lenses. There were also beautiful and expensive programs booklets available in these palaces. The opening scene was breathtaking! When I watched the Blu-ray - it was like being there all over again. Your neighborhood theaters were showing it on a regular screen with mono and sometimes stereo sound. A few years ago I saw it at the American Film Institute - it was a terrible print - it was a painful viewing - I did notice that the younger generation was having a great time - and just loving every moment of the film. A young father and I began talking - I shared with him my experience - he was very interested in just how these masterpieces were shown in their prime. I still loved the AFI presentation in spite of its flaws which conflicted with my experience of 45 years ago!<br /><br />This restoration is a real treat - it brings beautiful and rapturous memories!
B001AQO3QA|3.0|It's pretty much stuff that we've seen before in previous products like the Alien Quadrilogy that have been transferred to Blu-ray. If I rated it just for the movies, I'd give it somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars. The background material that was included the Alien Quadrilogy is included in this release as well as some new material. But before you get your hopes up, most of it appears to have been filmed at the same time as the Quadrilogy, but never really made it into the featurettes. Still notably absent are the interviews with some of the people that got messed with by 20th Century Fox and Brandywine like David Fincher, but also absent are interviews with the central player, Walter Hill. So, it remains essentially an incomplete work.  Despite its limitations and the pro Fox and Brandywine spin, the featurettes together pretty much tell the story of how the Alien franchise arose from being a B movie script to a timeless Sci-Fi classic as a result of the rare synergy of different and unique talents and fell as a result of corporate greed and hubris. Of particular interest is the additional material where some of the principals ruminate about the possible future of the franchise which sounds like a giant \\"I told you so\\" to both the AVP movies and seriously calls into question the justification behind the making of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection.    The only other thing I can say is the MUTH-UR mode is just daffy and annoying.  It's hard to read in some cases and frames the picture in a visually distracting manner when it's on.  And just like MUTH-UR, it is largely cryptic and unhelpful.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|After reading the negative and positive reviews of the The Pacific and finally viewing the DVD set, I have to say that the series is just astounding.  First of all, comparisons to Band of Brothers (BoB) is inevitable but unnecessary given that the battles in the European and the Pacific theatres were fundamentally different as any professional and avid historian will tell you.  The documentary included in the DVD states this quite poignantly.    As a result, the format and the presentation of the Pacific departs from BoB in that it focuses on 3 Marines (and not an entire combat unit as in BoB), and is much darker and cynical given that the Japanese and the Pacific War in general were far more brutal and savage to the American soldier. If you can understand these differences, the Pacific truly shines as it powerfully conveys how the 3 Marines change from gung-ho idealism to men emotionally and physically tempered by unrestrained combat, a relentless enemy, a brutal environment, and survivor's guilt.     And who are these Marines ? John Basilone, a true-believer of the Marine Corp, who wins the Medal of Honor in Guadacanal, but perishes in Iwo Jima.  Throughout the story, you get the sense that he is on borrowed time, but nevertheless lives his life to the fullest knowing well and good that death awaits him.  Bob Leckie, a Marine who enters the Pacific war not completely understanding what he has gotten into, and as a result finds himself on the brink of insanity as he struggles to make sense of the violence around him. And Eugene Sledge, a Marine who at moments of vicious fighting in Okinawa, finds and loses his humanity, and is left to question why he enlisted, the necessity of the war itself, and why he survived when others did not. In this vein, the Pacific is vastly more psychological than physical which is truly where the conflict lies in each man. Not to say that the violent battles depicted in the series are cheap and gratuitous. Quite the contrary.  They arebrutally realistic and assault the very core of these Marines, who are left to comprehend and survive a vicious world turned upside down.    For the reasons cited above, the Pacific is worth owning as it serves to better understand the WWII experience. You won't be disappointed !!
B003V6L94Q|1.0|This album is a classic case of putting out an album to soon after the last album which was actually good.  I am also pretty sure that they stole music from themselves off of their first album, which could be ok if the song didn't suck.  I am very disappointed that I actually paid for this album instead of getting a copy from a friend.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I work as a game specialist at a small board game store and I have played Settlers of Catan on numerous occasions. Like the title says...There is a reason why it's one of the number one selling board game in the world. Settlers is wildly popular in Europe where there is a huge board game following (to the likes of which Americans have never seen  before.) It's a great game that you wouldn't think requires much skill or effort to win, but it sometimes does.<br /><br />There are elements of sabotage, bartering, resource management, luck, and gambling that make for a entertaining game for everyone (even if they aren't board gamers.) With simple rules that don't take to long to learn and a decent time length for the average game, I would recommend this game to anyone that may be tired of the classics such as Monopoly, Scrabble, Sorry, etc...<br /><br />All in all a fun and entertaining game that almost all people that play will enjoy and end up purchasing for themselves or their families.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|I'm fairly particular when it comes to adding a DVD to my library. Only the best made film, or the most interesting get selected. After renting this movie while on vacation from a local grocery store I decided this one should be added to my library. This film is vintage Ridley Scott. Great action, good story, fantastic production. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are superb, and carry the film.  It doesn't get much better than this.
B00006IRJU|4.0|It's easy to see why 'Man Of Colours' became Icehouse's biggest album, and a worldwide hit; it's easily the most consistent album since their near-flawless debut. Although they had some brilliant individual songs and singles, some of Icehouse's other albums didn't quite match the peak of their debut. But there's no doubt about this one; Iva Davies and Co got their mojo back in the best possible way, delivering ten really strong and memorable pop songs.     'Crazy', 'Electric Blue', and `My Obsession' are obvious singles, and deserved their success, but there are plenty of other pop gems here too, such as 'Girl In The Moon' and especially 'The Kingdom' (a personal favourite). The title track is a subdued, haunting number, with a passionate vocal performance from Iva Davies, while 'Sunrise' is an anthemic closer. There are also a couple of surprisingly edgy and hard-driving songs like 'Anybody's War' and the horn-driven 'Nothing Too Serious' (another good vocal performance here).     There is not much that's particularly \\"arty\\" or \\"experimental\\" about this album. For the most part, the music is fairly straightforward mid 80's pop/rock. But 'Man of Colours' stands out because Icehouse were just so good at it. Iva Davies was a gifted composer and musician, and he surrounded himself with people like Rob Kretschmer and Andy Quanta, who were talented instrumentalists in their own right. The result is one of the most consistently strong synthpop albums of its time, full of pop hooks and clever songwriting. 'Man of Colours' should take pride of place in any collection of great 80's pop/rock.      Four stars.
B004132HZS|4.0|I REALY wanted to hate this production, the same way I hate Shakespeare in modern dress, but once viewed on PBS I have to come clean and admit I enjoyed it.  They're a little heavy handed on the high tech imagery, but I guess they want to hammer home that this isn't your father's Sherlock.    Sherlock is played as a hyperactive iconoclast which certainly isn't the way Conan Doyle wrote the character, but it does follow as a sort of pastiche of Jeremy Brett's decidedly off center version.  The modern stories are good but not great, with the first (\\"A Study in Pink\\") my favorite of the three.  Sherlockians will find many an homage to the Doyle stories peppered throughout these three with brother Mycroft, the dolt Lestrade and evil doer Moriarty playing minor parts and certainly laying the ground work to visit a post modern Riechenbach Falls.  Production values are up to typical BBC standards and even in the modern London there is an atmospheric quality that fits the Holmesian canon. In the end I suspect the degree of enthusiasm for this production will hang on generational demographics and good writing.  For me, they are an entertaining respite from the \\"real thing\\", but not something I would view over and over again the way I watch videos of Brett and Rathbone.  Remakes of the Sherlock Holmes stories come and go, both as pastiche and true to text presentations.  Given time this effort will seek it's own level in that growing group.    In my opinion nobody touches Basil Rathbone as the definitive Holmes and no video production can match the Granada series' \\"time period correctness\\" starring Jeremy Brett.  But (and I know this is a video review) in my opinion the very best way to enjoy Sherlock is with a treasured copy of William S. Baring-Gould's \\"The Annotated Sherlock Holmes\\" in your lap and Charles Viney's \\"Sherlock Holmes in London\\" on your end table.  Call me old fashioned, but the best fictional characters come alive in your mind when reading, not watching a DVD.  In this effort I just miss the gas lamps, horse drawn carriages and eventful train trips to lonely estates, so 5 stars for a well done modern take, production values and generally good writing and a star off for the certainty that these will not be in my library of \\"must view over and over\\" DVD's.  BTW:  Has anyone else noticed a more than passing resemblance of this Holmes and Watson to that of Doctors House and Wilson?  Even the surname initials fit....

B000002USN|4.0|I'm not sure that it's established fact that ALL of the duets included on this famous collection were done (shall-we-say?) in that \\"unforgettable\\" Natalie Cole style--with guest artists singing to a pre-recorded vocal (by Ol' Blue eyes, in this case), but it's actually pretty much what I would expect and nothing I'm about to get all het up about.  As controversial as Cole's duet album with her long deceased dad was in some circles, it actually brought new light on what has longsince been common music industry practice--namely, the fact that not all contributors to a project are in the studio at the same time.  Whatever complaints you may have about a potential lack of spontaneity or warmth, it's not uncommon even for duetting singers to never share studio time.      I remember once posting a note on the website of American roots singer Tracy Nelson's website (the singer, not the actress) inquiring about her experiences working with another singer (Eliza Gilkyson) I was interested in on a project album.  Ms Nelson recalled doing the track but acknowledged she had never worked directly w/ Ms Gilkyson, nor had she even met her.  Clearly, it's not just on slick pop projects that not-so-live duets, trios or you-name-the-number is routine practice.  And even if you don't find it ideal, artistically, you've got to admit that it's an interesting phenomenon.  I mean, just how is it done?  Did Sinatra record his half of the song, leaving gaps for the guest artist to fill in, OR did he do the whole thing as a run through, with certain spots being just a \\"working vocal\\" for the second singer to step into?    There are actually some advantages to singing along with a pre-recorded Frank.  For one thing, you get a few chances to work out just how you're going to respond to some of his famous \\"nutty, cuckoo\\" improvisations (with both lyrics and melody).  That seems to be the case on several tracks, particularly the opener 7(\\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\")with Luther Vandross and \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" with Charles Aznavour.  Perhaps as a nod to real or imagined feminist critcs, Sinatra mostly changes \\"tramp\\" to \\"CHAMP\\" in the former song, but not always.  In a live duet, it'd be hard for his vocal partner to keep up with Sinatra's constant playing with that (and just about every other) lyric.  Responding to a recording allows Vandross to sing the same text and to play off some of the Chairman's imporvisations and just stay on top of things overall.      As for Aznavour (as it is elsewhere for Julio Iglesias, to some extent), imagine what a relief it is for a non-native speaker of English to NOT have to keep up with Sinatra's slangy and highly idiomatic textual improvisations.  Iglesias has it somewhat easier on \\"Summer Wind,\\" which the usually breezy Sinatra sings fairly straight.  It is, in fact, Iglesias who improvises here and there--playing of his Spanish roots at one point by singing \\"two AMIGOS and the summer wind.\\"  Some may find that endearing; others may think it a bit cutesy.      If Sinatra's vocals weren't \\"live\\" for the tracks with Streisand and Anita Baker, you'd never know it from their warm interplay and conversational insertions.  Tony Bennett and Sinatra are so simpatico that the actual circumstances of their recording of \\"New York, New York\\" scarcely matter.  And Aretha Franklin's vocal on \\"What Now My Love\\" has such grandeur that it's hard to care whether she and Frank shared studio space and went out for coffee after the session.  And speaking of vocal chops, Sinatra still had 'em for this session.  I've heard some clips of him toward the end of his life that weren't nearly as strong, but on DUETS,  he seems to be in rather good voice.    Perhaps I can be such a fan of this record because (ironically) I am not a huge, huge Sinatra fan in general.  It seems that many of the negative reviews stem from ardent admirers of his '40s (and particularly) his '50s work.  If not exactly ardent,  I'm nonetheless an admirer of those recordings, and I find it really quite interesting to hear the older, wiser, if somewhat more vocally frayed singer's re-takes on some of this classic material.  Perhaps if I were more emotionally invested in the older versions,  I would be as indignant as others seem to be that their memory has been tampered with.  I find I can enjoy this CD pretty much for what it is--and isn't.  The comparison/contrasts to earlier work is fascinating.    Is DUETS (and its follow-up) gimmicky product masquerading as art? Was Sinatra just coasting and cashing in at the end of his career?   Well, that's up for individual listeners to judge.  To paraphrase the Rolling Stones, \\"It's only contemporary adult popular music and I like it.\\"

0312600844|4.0|I watched an interview with the author, and was intrigued by the plot line, so I bought it, and also purchased _The We Came To THe End_ which I started reading first. And tossed at page 174. Couldn't stomach anymore. Waited a month to start _Freedom_ and finished it in under a day. My only and big complaint is the use of the word c**t. I hate that word no matter the usage. I hope whoever came up with that word is still burning in hell. My second complaint about the using of this word, is that I don't care how crazy or loopy a man is, or how many personalities he has, he would never use that word towards another man, or even use it to describe himself. He just wouldn't. There are at least three other names you could put in place of that word, and the effect would be the same.     Just my opinion, while the book is good, has a strong plot line, it certainly shouldn't be in the top ten books of the year.

0316077054|5.0|Sequels can be tricky.  Can the author(s) maintain the story arc, make the reader still emotionally invest in established characters while introducing new ones, continue to pace the story so it engages the reader?  Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl can do this and more.  They can build a multi-dimensional paranormal Castor World while doing justice to the Gothic South with its small town customs, history and language.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Creatures\\" and \\"Beautiful Darkness\\" are aimed at the YA market.  Believe me when I say there is no way I fit into that niche.  The books are good enough to engage an adult reader and make them look forward to the 3rd book in the series.  I have recommended \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" to numerous YA and adult readers and will continue to do so with its sequel.  Anytime a book/series that appeals enough to YA to get them reading and discussing it that is worth kudos from me.<br /><br />The plot has been revealed by previous reviewers enough not to warrant further telling. My only bit of advice to them is not to forget the Ethan/Lena connection and romance that made this series so successful.<br /><br />Buy the book for a YA reader or better yet for yourself.  You will not be sorry.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I like the book but have to admit it was a little slow for me at times. I suppose where it was slow for me is all the details of the war and how many troops France had and how many Germany had etc... The book really picks up in the last half, and I had trouble putting it down. I wish there would of been a little more on David & Lucy. I found myself kind of skimming parts of the book until it came back to this couple.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I loved , loved this series. I am just so sad about Andy Whitfield won't be back due to his illness. May God be with him and his family. The fact that this stayed close to the history was amazing. If you go by history it really made you think that they were in the time period. I also liked that they did not hold anything back but I do wonder if some of the words they used were around at this time. I would highly recommend this series to any adult film buff but most certainly not to children.
B000QUCNXG|2.0|Very disappointed.   I expected more and this short novella did not deliver.  The author selects a very tiny slice of society and includes OLD stereotypes.  .  I would have liked a more detailed discussion of why he felt happiness in the 9/11 attacks and why a lunch should have crystallize his dissatisfaction with his firm.  This is not a philosophic conversation about fundamentalism, more like a litany of America's wrongs.

I'm not sure if a person unfamiliar with the topic would get much out of this book, because the emphasis seems to be on a somewhat wishy-washy concept of \\"love\\".  There are few practical instructions beyond \\"imagine it\\", \\"feel it\\", \\"believe it\\", and \\"love it\\", and everything is accentuated by lots and lots of exclamation points!  Really!<br /><br />After reading this book, I did realize that I tend to take a rather negative view of things, and that a bit more positivity wouldn't hurt.  Beyond that, though, I'm not sure if I found much helpful information.  Some suggestions for guided meditations or how to make a vision board would have been nice.<br /><br />The book itself is very pretty, though, and would make a nice gift for anyone who likes this sort of thing.  I'm sort of on the fence with this one.  It wasn't great... but it wasn't completely awful, either.

B000VZSEWA|5.0|If you read the majority of the One Star reviews here, its easy to see why the rating is so low. Outside of a handful of people who actually had a point and a reason to rate it that low, the majority of them are more or less whining that its not \\"The Downward Spiral 2.0\\"...... Same reason why so many people complained about \\"The Fragile\\" album when it came out.    Not that this album is anywhere close to \\"The Fragile\\" though. Its a bit rushed and can get overly- preachy at points, but theres no way this album should be getting a 1 star rating from anybody. Its not one of their finer moments but, especially when compared to the music of the moment, its a breathe of fresh air. Trent Reznor is still a musical genius and a few songs on this album would make my NIN greatest hits record    Highlights :The Hand that Feeds, My Violent Heart, Survivalism and In This Twilight    Low Point: Capitol G (worst NIN song I think)    Realistically should be a 3/5 , but I'm gonna give it a 5/5 to balance out the over Emotional characters on here giving it 1/5 because there upset its not a repeat of what he did 15 years ago. Not there best effort but certainly not horrible by any stretch of the imagination. If your a fan of NIN, you'll find alot of stuff here to like, as well as a few songs that make you wonder \\"What was he thining when he wrote that\\"

B00499K9E0|5.0|I am so in love with this new Sherlock Holmes adaption that I had to buy. You can watch it for free on the PBS website but as this fangirl will require extra viewings, I pluncked down my hard earned money and got the episodes on instant view. I really enjoyed this younger, more action-man version of Holmes. It somehow seems closer to the original character somehow. The series itself is suspenseful, intelligent and inventive. The actors are simply yummy! Sherlock is of course wonderful to look at; all long limbs and ethereal cheekbones. But my heart belongs to Watson; broken, valiant and smoldering. He is simply delish! The difficulties veterans face once coming home was poignant and relevant in this modern time. Bringing the art of deduction into the age of technology was an impressive and well executed feat. This series is great for the whole family. There are, to my eternal delight, several nods to female fans obsession with leading male trysts, yet the characters remain manly enough to not scare off male viewers. The end revelation of who Moriarty was left me squeeling and Watsons quip during the pool scene left me gasping! Such fun! My only critique is that the season is way too short. Only three episodes leaves me begging for more! Can't wait for the next season! I highly recommend this show.

0547338023|5.0|Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's 'Le Petit Prince' was written in 1943 and has become a staple in the libraries of children (and adults who has preserved their child-like reverence for the philosophy that The Little Prince expounds) throughout the world: latest statistics show that the book has been translated into 190 languages and has sold in excess of 80 million copies!  This last figure is sure to change with the introduction of this new version - the same story but made in to the graphic novel format by Johann Sfar, an illustrator par excellence.<br /><br />There will doubtless be purists who prefer the original (very exquisite) illustrations for the book and feel that the presentation of the story in graphic novel format (read `comic book format') diminishes the concept of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry.  But the joy here is that the illustrations are so excellent and so very much in keeping with the original story, that given the chance the book will take hold of any reader and become user friendly.<br /><br />The story is so well known that it needn't be reiterated here: suffice it to summarize as `an aviator whose plane is forced down in the Sahara Desert encounters a little prince from a small planet who relates his adventures in seeking the secret of what is important in life'. It is a fable so fine that it has been transformed into a film by Stanley Donen, stage play by several writers including Rick Cummins and John Scoullar, an opera by Rachel Portman, and now another art form - the graphic novel.  For this reader it is successful on every level, and if anything this new edition will introduce this charming fable to millions more readers, young in years or in spirit. Grady Harp, November 10
B003HARV3Y|3.0|When the movie first came to theater, I encouraged my son we should read the book before seeing the movie.  The first page of the book had us hooked!  The time for it to be in theater ended so I bought the movie as soon as it came out on DVD.  By this time we had read all 5 books in this series and had gobbled down the 1st book in the Kane series.    We were disappointed in the movie.  It strayed away from the book and Greek mythology.  As one reviewer points out about Percy, Annabeth, and Grover being greeted by Pes ... Pes (what her name???)  Anyway, that particular gal wouldn't have been with Hades in the Underworld because it was Summer!!  She only stayed with Hades during the Autumn and Winter.  Also, since the Oracle was eliminated, they elimated a MAIN character that shows up in ALL 5 books.    I give it 3 stars because .... 1) As an action movie with a story of it's own it does ok and my son chose to block out that fact it didn't follow the book.  When you judge it as movie, it can stand.  2) Because it didn't follow the book nor remain true to the plot of the book.   So, I give it the \\"middle of the road\\" score.    I would like to take this time to mention that parents should take an active involvement with their children's reading and entertainment choices.  I read one comment by a parent that said Medusa was scary looking and the movie isn't for ages 8-12.  Well?  Sorry, but that is Medusa for ya!  Have ya read the book or studied any Greek mythology?  If the 3 headed dog in the underworld doesn't scare ya, nuttin will. LOL  Seriously, be active with what kids are reading, watching, and playing not just because you need to be informed BUT so you can have fun with them!!

B00000G3PA|4.0|This is one movie besides Ever After that I will watch more than once. I don't like to watch movies more than once unless it has been a long time since I have seen them, so that is saying something. I know the movie is ridiculous, but honestly I think it is better if you look at it from an emotional/communication standpoint rather than a scientific one. This movie shows a wide range of emotions that these people went through and how different people in the same circumstances deal with their fears or inadequacies some rise above them and others let them take over. When Bruce Willis lets Ben Affleck live even though Ben was willing to make the sacrifice it shows how much a father can love his child and I know that is one of Gods greatest gifts the love of our parents. No matter what we do they want us to be happy even if it means sacrificing their happiness or life for it. This part in the movie makes me cry every time I watch it.      The overall message is that life is short and you never know when it is going to end. So stop wanting material things because in the end the only thing that is going to keep you alive or give you the will to live is the people that you love such as your family or friends.

Madonna is the Queen of Pop and always will be! I really enjoyed everything about this concert, just pure entertainment. I loved the new renditions of some of the Material Girl's older hits like Into the Groove, Human Nature, La Isla Bonita, Vogue, and You Must Love Me. And I really love the rock version of Borderline! The performance that really blew me away was Like A Prayer, what an explosive, heartfelt moment...goosebumps literally! Madonna does look a little thin but she can still outdance her younger hoofers and her guitar playing has really approved. Miles Away, She's Not Me, Heartbeat, and Devil Wouldn't Recognize You sound great as well. I highly recommend this amazing concert! Enjoy!

I began to feel towards the middle of the book that the story line was falling apart. And it goes downhill from there. This book has potential characters with story lines that were just not nurtured. It seemed the author introduced them then nothing more. I almost wish someone had said to the author as Ma said to Jack, \\"just slow down, count to 100, breath\\". I just can't believe the other \\"rave\\" reviews about this book.
B00006I53S|1.0|After using this lens with other lens, I conclude that  this is the worst lens I have ever used so far.  And it is useless for crop sensor cameras. And I am wondering  why this lens came with Canon 7D as a bundle.  Whenever I bring this lens out, I always regret.  28mm is not wide enough.  And the general purpose quality of  28-135 mm is below the general quality.  If I compare this lens with Sigma 17-70mm, Sigma is so much  better. Sigma has so much quality and the sharpness is really  amazing. I normally don't realize it until I switch the lens with  this low quality Canon 28-135mm. Comparing with Tamron's  18-250mm, within the same range, I think that Tamron is  still better. And I am wondering why you should use this lens  when you use cropped sensor camera.  And I you use an expensive full frame camera, there is no  reason why you make your full frame camera a cheap point and  shoot by using this lens.
1416550550|5.0|I first read House at Riverton and quickly picked this book up.  So glad I did.  I read it within a week and never put it down.  The only thing that may turn others off from this author is that it is a lot like the Time Travelers Wife.  With each chapter, it is flipping between 3 different timelines and 3 different generations of women.  But with each chapter, I was left on edge, having no idea how the story could get any more interesting.  It did take some effort keeping all of the story lines straight but I just loved it!  If you like this author, I suggest you try Joshilyn Jackson also.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to be released this week.
B002ZG999U|2.0|- The action scenes could not exploit the skills of the stars. For example the  fighting between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren was a big disappointment. It's too dark. I could hardly see anything.    - The plot has been repeated multiple times before.    - In short, it's a waste of all the talents of  all the stars such as Stallone, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham
B003Q6D27S|3.0|John Kramer wanted to play a game and now it's coming to an end with Saw 3D. After six Saw movies I suspect that if you're currently reading this, you're obviously a fan who followed the Saw franchise. If you've never cared for Saw or always hated the franchise this one probably won't change your mind. However, for fans it's a fitting end to the series and we owe it to ourselves as fans to see this \\"final\\" Saw. After all we followed the entire series and waited year after year to see the new Saw movie (I personally did). In the past  we've seen Jigsaw die, the rise and fall of Amanda Young, Hoffman taking control and countless victims die. The seventh Saw brings something the other Saw movies didn't have : 3D, hence the title Saw 3D (although it is also referred to as Saw VII). Saw 3D ends it all, we get answers it and has the most traps out of all the Saw movies. Speaking of traps, they're not bad at all but I felt it was almost impossible to outdo what they previously did (Saw VI had some pretty interesting ones). The 3D, however, offers something different and makes VII that much more disgusting and gory.<br /><br />Saw 3D is all about putting the pieces of the puzzles together and end Saw while it's time (no one wants Saw 14 do they?) to. This time around we're following Bobby Dagen who wrote a book called \\"Survive\\" about his fake experience as a victim of Jigsaw. Dagen achieves fame because of his book and Jigsaw is determined to give him what he deserves. At the beginning we see a flashback sequence of Dr. Lawrence Gordon which finally explains what happened to him after the events of Saw 1 (I'm not spoiling anything, fans have been wondering what happened to Gordon ever since the original Saw, it's about time we found out). ) We also see what happens to Jigsaw's wife, Jill, who's been somewhat of a mystery since Saw V. Hoffman's future is also addressed and as claimed nothing is left without an answer. I find it a little insulting to fans that the two most important characters of Saw VII, Jigsaw and Dr. Gordon don't receive enough screen time, especially considering this is supposed to be the final Saw. Jigsaw barely has 5 minutes of screen time for the whole movie (perhaps they killed him a little too early in the series?) and Gordon who is very important to this final Saw doesn't get as much time as he should (his situation is mostly recaps unfortunately).<br /><br />Saw 3D is a fitting ending and puts the pieces of the puzzle together, likely to satisfy the fans but nothing exceptional for the fans who have seen all previous films. There was supposed to be an eight Saw film but after Saw VI did poorly at the box office (when compared to the other Saw films at least) it was decided that it would better for everyone if they ended the series as quick as possible. I think it might have been better had the time been taken to make two separate movies but Saw VII is an entertaining conclusion to the series. I'm not a huge of 3D but I admit it worked well in Saw 3D and it did add some excitement to the series. Most viewers certainly seem to think so, Saw 3D has earned over $ at the box office. Producer Mark Burg said that the DVD release of Saw VII will be 2D only and that 3D will be theater only. Saw 3D received mostly negative reviews from critics, but Saw movies nearly always get poor reviews from the \\"professionals\\" so if you're a fan don't bother with negativity and enjoy it for what it is. I liked Saw VII 3D for what it was, certainly not my favorite Saw film but decent. Regardless of your opinion it's time to admit that the game is over, 3/5.characters of Saw VII, Jigsaw and Dr. Gordon don't receive enough screen time, especially considering this is supposed to be the final Saw.

B003YOZNBU|1.0|- The special effects were terrible. In many scenes, I could see they were obviously fake. For examples, the scene where Jonah was shooting 2 machine guns straddled on both sides of his horse. Yeah right!<br /><br />- The plot was thin. The acting was non-emotional even when it was showing a teen being abused by the leader of the bad guys.<br /><br />- There is no humor.<br /><br />- Even Megan Fox could not save this movie. It's another nail in the coffin of Western genre. No wonder, the majority of movie-goers do not pay to watch Western films any more.
B0017OB12O|5.0|Let us not forget this was filmed on location. Top notch gigs by Holden Hawkins Hayakawa and an all time job by Alec Guiness. The last scene ranks as perhaps the most ggripping scene of adventure in film history. Lean was and still is when you watch this, one of the top ten directors of all time.
B001NLKT60|5.0|My first book review..I have read all three of these books by Stieg Larsson and was sad to learn that the author died in 2004 after delivering them to the publisher.  All three books were convoluted, mysterious filled with love, hate and life's sadness and humor.  I just loved them and the never ending surprises.  I also have seen both movies and have preordered \\"The Girl who kicked the hornets nest\\"  If you love mysteries, real life type of  backroom politics, deceit, betrayal and just good drama, these books are for you.
0525951652|3.0|After reading \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World without End\\", I was very anxious to read this book. However, I found this book to be disappointing. Follett could not seem to build any suspense or tension with his WWI story. I learned a lot about the Great War that I didn't know, but the characters were just not that interesting to follow. I am hoping for something better with the second intallment.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|..... that is what I told my friends when I saw the trailer. One of my friends went to see it and he told all of us it was the movie of the year or decade or whatever so I was almost forced to go watch it by everyone and guess what? I was probably the one laughing the loudest. Talk about judging a book by its cover.... this movie was awesome.... I felt so attached to the characters for reasons I cannot explain. I had lots of laugh out loud moments so I enjoyed it. And what the hell is up with that girl, Ramona Flowers ... I feel she's hot but its nothing like I would say is the standard of hot if there is such a thing. She just naturally made my focus on her so mesmerizing but I'm going off topic here. Over-all I give the movies a 9/10 because two of the fights I found a bit weak like the concert one but the music redeems it and Inception remains my number one movie as of now with Ram--Scott Pilgrim not far behind

Then as the book progressed, it just kept getting better and better!  It was simply more than I imagined and I really want more.  Now I want to know what happens to Jacob in the future with his life the way it is headed at the end of this book!  I cannot wait for the movie, I hope they include the romance, humor, horror and emotion that the book holds.

193413712X|5.0|Is this the most riveting book ever written? No.<br /><br />But then, the Pulitzer Committee is not searching for a roller-coaster thriller likely to be forgotten when finished. According to its guidelines, for its fiction award, it is looking:<br /><br />\\"For distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life...\\"<br /><br />Paul Harding's \\"Tinkers\\" is definitely distinguished, commanding the respect of the reader long afterward.<br /><br />The novel is also distinctly American--set in New England, it echoes the great works of the American Romantics, building upon them in a new and powerful way. Hawthorne's \\"Scarlet Letter\\" is referred to explicitly with great panache. I also felt echoes of Hawthorne's classic short story, \\"Roger Malvin's Burial,\\" a tale about unkept promises and familial loss upon the early American frontier (but perhaps that was my own reader-response).<br /><br />Harding's book retraces the New England landscape of this same American frontier--some centuries later--obliquely. As various tropes surfaced throughout the work, such as hieroglyphics, I was reminded of Emerson's \\"Nature,\\" which also made use of the trope (it was common in a lot of literature of the Romantics--especially after the news of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone). Just as Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, and other American Romantics would explore the deep, ineffable mysteries of Nature, so does Harding, with poetic symbolism, in this modern, transcendentalist masterpiece.<br /><br />That said, don't get too worked up if the novel doesn't make perfect sense on the first read. It is not written chronologically. Instead, Harding writes in Emersonian circles, so to speak; the narrative shifts about, eventually receding deeper and deeper into the past--into the pain, joy, and wonder of being human--even as life is ebbing away. This novel works its magic on the reader--the audience feels a true connection. That is, we leave the world of fiction, walking away down the paths of our own lives, contemplating what is most precious as this ephemeral dream speeds by.away down the paths of our own lives, contemplating what is most precious as this ephemeral dream speeds by.

B003YUC2FE|3.0|The Toy Story trilogy is amazing, as most would suspect. However the 3-star rating given to this product is NOT because of the movies, it is for the sub-par packaging they come in. For such a lucrative franchise I expected much more. The \\"toy box\\" design is certainly cool, keeping with the theme of Toy Story, but the disks sit inside a styrofoam container with little room to grab each disk. The flimsy quality of the actual toy box could be an issue in the making as I am not certain it will last that long. I wouldn't recommend leaving this for little ones to play with or use, in stead take out the disks and place them in slim jewel cases or possibly buy the 3-disk trilogy instead.
1442337966|5.0|I have read and watched Rhonda Byrne's 'The Secret' which is superb and this. although a little harder to assimilate surpases that. Anyone with an interest in self-help should listen to this and read 'The Power' book.
6304711905|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It is absolutely the best western movie I have ever seen.  It has everything; cowboys, liquor, guns, whores, gambling,and best of all Doc Holiday! Val Kilmer made the whole movie. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role of Doc Holiday. While the story is widely about Wyatt Earp, it would not be much of a show if not for Kilmer's rendition of Doc.
0439023513|3.0|I finished the book yesterday and I am still trying to sort through my feelings. I have read over other reviews of both likes and dislikes for the book, but strangly I am still finding myself in the middle.    To begin with, I was pretty dissapointed and bored through the first 2/3 of the book. Not seeing Peeta was bothersome because he was always such a loveable character to read about. It was nice to finally meet Gale and learn more about Prim, but Katniss was not herself. Reflecting back on the end, maybe that was the point that war changed all of them and there was no reclaiming the characters they once were. Even so, I missed lovable Peeta and strong determined Katniss.     Through out the first 2/3 of the book I kept waiting for the excitment I saw in the other books, Collins would bring you there and then bam the chapter would end and Katniss would be back in the hospital being druged up. The story never really moved anywhere and again maybe that was the intention...Collin's was trying to paint a picture as using all the characters as pawns in her sick twisted game that was just as bad as Snow.    As I moved into the final third of the book, my interest started to peek. Although, with the introduction of a slew of characters that had no part in the book, but to show the mass destruction war can have was confusing to the main story line. I tried to start connecting the dots on what the end would hold for all, but nothing prepared me for the bomb going off with the children and Prim being in the middle of it.     This angered me because from the very first page of the Hunger Games Katniss stepped in to take Prim's place in the games to protect her and Collins just decided to rip this away. Yes, it shows that war is ugly and people die that we don't want to die, but it was what define Katniss. As Gale said in the cellar, Katniss always wanted to protect her family more than herself, but that was totally void in this book. Collins took everything that was great away from Katniss and made her into a sad scared little girl. Why not kill Peeta or Gale to help beef up her romance, I asked myself why Prim?    After the bomb, I was numb and struggled through the last pages. As I neared the end, I felt that I would not be walking away from the book with happiness. The final pages of the story seemed shoveled together and I was instantly angry when Collin's was so quick to write Gale off and explain Peeta and her getting together in a short 1 page summary. I understand that it really was never about the romance, it was about the war and Katniss, but come on...give the readers what they want!     Above all the somber ending angered me because I started relating it back to our soldiers coming home. Really Collins is saying that it doesn't really matter once you are war you will never be whole again. Not even the love of a man or having children will change what you have been through. I DON'T BUY IT! Yes, Katniss has been through hell and back so has Peeta, but by leaving her dead inside proved one thing, Snow won, Coin won, because Katniss is defeated forever. She isn't physically dead, but the emotional tolls have killed her.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Entirely to much Edward in this movie to me. I am totally team Jacob (but there was really no team because she choose Edward in the first movie, the second movie and the third movie). So there really was no triangle and to me thats where movie the failed. If Bella was torn she should had more time with Jacob to see where heart really was. Instead all we got tons of Edward. (YUCK). But the movie was good. And so three stars for Jacob.
B000AADYUI|5.0|I have loved this album from when I first heard it at age 10, and my praises will echo those of past critiques.  As a previous Amazon reviewer noted--this record is really still the Airplane, regardless of its being credited to the Starship.  There's a lot to love here--this is the best concept album by the Airplane besides &#34;After Bathing at Baxter's&#34;.  The difference being--whereas &#34;Baxter's&#34; can revel in the sinister in its exploration of the darker side of psychedelia, &#34;Blows&#34; is a joyful, hopeful and happy hippie record--although the album concept / through-line seems idealistic by today's cynical standards.  The positive musical influence via participation by David Crosby, Jerry Garcia and crew is in evidence here as well.  None of the cuts are weak and all the songs flow into each other effortlessly.  Highlights include &#34;The Baby Tree&#34;, &#34;Let's Go Together&#34;, &#34;A Child is Coming&#34;, and my favorite--the final cut &#34;Starship&#34;.  &#34;Sunrise&#34; is another one of Grace Slick's angry witch songs, at which she excels.  The rocket noises and spaceship effects of &#34;Home&#34; provide a bridge from &#34;Hijack&#34; to bring us into orbit with &#34;Have You Seen the Stars Tonight&#34;.  &#34;XM&#34; features more blast off sound effects providing yet another segue-prelude to the celebration that is &#34;Starship&#34;.  A final note--the Russian cover art is fabulous, as is the surrealistic and sexually ambiguous artwork featured on the back cover.<br /><br />Stephen C.

1416589473|5.0|As far as video game adaptations go, this was top-notch, especially considering that Ghosts is less of a creative interpretation and more factual to in-game lore.  The authors avoided making their cast of characters complete cardboard cutouts of their representative races, while still managing to give the reader a fairly accurate sampling of what defines each race.  The story is well-paced, action-oriented, and certainly entertaining for any Guild Wars enthusiast awaiting the release of Guild Wars 2.  For those unfamiliar with Guild Wars, I'd recommend Ghosts of Ascalon to any fan of high fantasy as a good introduction to Tyria.

B00004WX4U|5.0|The Music on Vinyl label always does a great job, but the sound quality and quietness of the vinyl is impeccable on this one.  There was unfortunately a factory defect on the first track of each side, however that adds clicks for the first 20 seconds or so.  Once you get past those defects, however, the sound will blow you away.  Just a note for any Americans like me buying this:  It is imported from Europe, and in Europe I guess they don't always seal the records in shrink wrap.  Instead it came in more of a dust cover type jacket that is resealable.  It's nice because you can keep it, but makes you wonder if anyone else has taken it for a spin before you got it...

B001HN69AY|3.0|I caught this on cable TV. I didn't know it was a Terry Gilliam film. If I'd known, I would have skipped it as Gilliam's movies are always incoherent as if conceived in a drug haze...or something. As it was the thing pulled me in from the beginning and I stuck with it, however near the end, like everyone else, I had no idea what was going on.    The special effects were stunning. I especially liked the metaphor destruction of the drunken young man at the beginning. After he slips through \\"the mirror\\" on stage, he ends up in a Salvador Dali-like world where he has 2 choices: climb the terribly high steps of knowledge and achievement at the heavenly castle, or immediately get drunker at the pub next to it. He of course takes the \\"easy road\\" and soon after he enters, the pub explodes.    The acting and actors were especially good, all of them seemed to have a chemistry. Vern Troyer (Mini-Me) finally gets to speak and has a big part. He surprisingly held his ground with classic trained actors like Ledger and Plummer. And his big eyes hold you mesmerized. When he's on screen, you can't take your eyes off him.    I'll only watch it once, but if you want to see a movie with really great production values, this is it. Don't expect to make sense of the story.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|Well, you buy a doll from a movie this name and you get what you pay for.  Our 4 year old daughter received this as a birthday gift yesterday.  Already, the doll's hair is one big tangled mess and almost impossible to brush.  Our daughter wasn't rough with her, just normal playing, but I guess when she has this much hair it is to be expected.  The extension is a joke though and not nearly as thick or lush as it looks in the photo.  I don't really get the concept because, when you snap it on, it's just one skinny piece trailing behind Rapunzel and looks like a tail.  So, we've pretty much put that part to the side.  Maybe she just need a deep conditioning treatment or something.  Oh well, our daughter loves it and is taking it for Show and Tell tomorrow, which is a big deal in preschool.  And, we're very much looking forward to seeing the movie.

It contains a Refreshingly original story, a creepy as hell atmosphere, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.     This movie starts out creepy and bizarre and has a constant satisfying momentum with several twists, plenty of monster fighting gory action, and lots of suspense. This movie transports you into a frightening and bizarre futuristic atmosphere of desolation and desperation. The movie also has you questioning the main characters' sanity and sense of morality, adding a surreal dimension that strokes the darkest parts of the human psyche.    The acting was great, the story was great, and the filming was great.  Love this movie!  The ending has a very unexpected twist and leaves you feeling relieved for the characters who go through hell, Literally HELL....don't miss this one!

Keith is legend and the book does a fairly good job about detailing how he used the open G tunings, his influences with Chuck Berry and Grahmn Nash, his hooking up with Lubbock legend Bobby Keys. Keith being a class act doesn't really speak all that badly about Anita or Mick, in fact some of his worst words are reserved for Brian Jones. The touching part of his book is his reunion with his estranged father.  Not a great book, but for Rock historians it's probably a must read just to get Keith's viewpoints.
B003X8597K|5.0|This story is presented as a generic brand political leader who believes that he knows how to save the world. There are no simple villains here because the people under his rule run amuck without a charismatic leader to keep them in line.     This production is a surrealistic presentation of a composite of all the dictators of the 29th Century and then some. From the very start we see Rienzi hallucinating his colossal office flying into space and suspending Earth in space awaiting his virtues than are neede3d to save it along with Rome. Over the course of the opera you see his break from reality as he genuinely wants to make life better for the people.     I wonder if the noblemen who turned against him because he pardoned them for treason are a warning against what we see in Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Unfortunately, the Indy franchise was well past that best-when-used-by date before this movie was released. As much as I've love the Jones character, played by Harrison Ford, it was a different character than the one played by a now, much older, Ford. I'm not sure whether his heart simply wasn't in it or if script was so bad it never gave him a chance, but the suspension of belief to watch this movie just wasn't possible. The supporting cast just didn't make for me either. Karen Allen was in it for the money and the her storyline was simply weak. And the LaBeouf character was there as eye candy for the younger set who, presumably, find him to be a star. As far as the script goes without giving any spoilers away, it was ridiculous. Apparently, the director, Spielberg, had a few spare alien CGI characters laying around from Close Encounters that he needed to use.    All in all, a major, if not totally unexpected, waste of time.
1416589473|5.0|The book is compelling. It hooked me from the start. You don't need to have had played the game to enjoy the book, even though a few characters and events from the games are mentioned they aren't the whole story.

B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I LOVE this record...and I do happen to like most of the man's work. While not a fan of Chickenfoot, it appears that working in that band has reinvigorated his passion to take chances...moreover, it seems to have relaxed him, as his soulful playing breathes and he allows more contribution from his terrific new band (here, in addition to mainstay Campitelli, includes the wondrously gifted Mike Keneally on keys and Allen Whitman on bass)...personally, I find \\"Black Swan and Wormhole Wizards\\" to be as good as anything Satriani has done in his career. \\"Wind in the Trees\\" is stunningly beautiful....\\"Premonition\\" is fantastic, classic Satch... \\"Littleworth Lane\\" and \\"Two Sides to Every Story\\" are refreshingly new and fun territory. Not much shredding here, which is fine by me, and the warm production is excellent, and makes it a joy to revisit... I highly recommend it.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I enjoyed this film, but don't think it was as good as the first one.  It's a little slow on getting to the action, and doesn't give Micky Rourke enough screen time.  All in all it was an enjoyable follow-up to the first movie, just not filled with many surprises.
B003UYUR10|4.0|The plot was great, super action scenes, acting was above average.  This movie was very easy to identify with.

B002ZG99CM|2.0|The original was so much better.  The story line was grasping at straws and the acting was very poor.  The disk was bare bones.  I was disappointed.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Excellent! Makes me wonder if Brian Wilson, back in his Little Duce Coupe days, ever suspected that some 45 years later, perhaps is best work would be one that features a collection of Gershwin tunes. Great music,great performance and way better than average sound quality.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|It wasn't what I was expecting, based upon the previews.  I didn't find out till the end of the movie, that this movie was how Robin Hood got started.  That is the only thing that disappointed me.  The acting was great and sub plots were so entertaining!

We are very happy to own this Alien Quadrilogy.
0316098337|5.0|Wow.T his was was shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker and to be honest I liked it more than \\"The Finkler Question\\" which won the award this year.  Having three kids myself, I can point to many instances when I have said to myself \\"Wow I am just so tired and I can't imagine taking the time now to play with them.\\" And then to imagine that the mother was able to conceive of all of these different games, adn instructions, and names, and different ways of amusing, cajoling, and simply keeping her son going without knowing when and if they would be freed not to mention enduring unending abuse.  The scene where the son first encountered stairs reminded me of bringing home a newborn puppy for the first time and sitting him in front of a set of stairs--he simply did not know what to do.  I highly recommend this book.  It is quick. It is gripping. It evokes emotion.  And the story ends in a perfect way.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I like this purchase and it comes faster than expected.  I viewed it several times and will keep it for my collection.  It is the best action movies in my collection.
0312600844|3.0|Franzen does a good job with character development but overall I found the book to be just too long. Ironically, the number one comment I have received about this book is in regards to its length and how difficult it was to get through.  Walter is quite an interesting and tragic charcater.  He keeps your interest throughout the book as much for his constant search for self-validation through his foundation as well as his ability to hold off the advances of his assistant for so long.  This is in stark contrast to his friend Richard who as is one of the most \\"out there,\\" belligerent, and adventurous characters you will encounter in any novel.  His son Joey also brings a great deal of tragedy to the book.  As a parent, I found myself saying \\"Come on Joey--just get back on the straight and narrow and get your life together.  Finally, you sympathize with Patty who in some cases is the glue that keeps the story together while also maddening you with her lack of a backbone.  A well-written but sometimes long-winded ride down the path of family travails.
0470477237|5.0|Erik Qualman highlights all the basics and more in Socialnomics. His research makes this book indisputable; I guarantee you'll be amazed by some of the statistics shared in this book.

I highly recommend this book for any person or business looking to brand themselves through social media (which really should be everybody).
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie and the soundtrack.  it's about real life, successful life, honest life.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|This has to be one of the best episodes on tv of the year.  The pilot for the show was good and indicated an interesting path for the series but I feel like this episode was even better.  I mean crazy good.  I can\\"t wait to see more from this show.  I don't understand how shows as good as this can be made when really lame shows like The Event are what garner the biggest viewers.  How did Lone Star ever get canceled either?  Well seriously folks this show, its insanely good.  If there were a magic word to get you to watch it, I\\"d say it.

B002G3459Q|4.0|It really bugs me when I see this book filed under \\"religion\\" simply because it has the word \\"Zen\\" in the title.  This book isn't about Zen, and it isn't about motorcycle maintenance.  It is an exploration into the idea of \\"quality,\\" what it means, and what it should mean.    This book is the perfect gift for professors who say you should not be so focused on grades.  It analyzes the whole carrot and stick approach that our education has become and turns it on its head.    The narrative that accompanies this exploration is both entertaining, and you will discover pertinent.  I found some of the digressions a little boring, but pushed on anyway, and boy, was it worth it.
0553381687|5.0|Although I am only half way through the first book of the series, I happened to see an interview of George R.R. Martin which prompted me to write this review.  In the interview, Martin states that the Song of Fire and Ice books are \\"fantasy for adults.\\"  He is absolutely correct, that's exactly what these books are and they are exactly what I was looking for in a fantasy series.  I had not read much fantasy since J.R.R Tolkien and was looking for a series with something more than fluff or violence or magic.  These books fit the bill.  The Fire and Ice books are not the Fantasy of adolescent pimply faced teenage boys, nor is it the fantasy of breathless stay at home housewives, it is the fantasy of real life, good and evil, brains and stupidity and all the rest of the stuff we all struggle with.  Nothing less than five stars for this series.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I had become a Reacher fan & decided to read the first installment in this series. Mr. Child has provided a well written & gripping novel. He's developed Jack Reacher's character well in book one. Reacher basically hasn't changed much; he's been tweaked a bit.<br />Here, the premise is a small out of the way town in Georgia which is controlled by a couple of high powered men. These fellows are also running the largest counterfeiting ring ever. Reacher, ever the wanderer, strolls into town & is caught up in it.<br />The unfolding story is gripping & entertaining.<br /><br />On the down side, I found a couple things not too plausible. The coincidence of Jack & his brother in the same place? A brother he rarely sees. The failure of the Treasury Dept. not getting involved when two of their agents go missing?<br /><br />Still, I'm going with 5 stars on this one since it was basically well done for the first in a series. I found it difficult to put down
044654146X|5.0|This is a fantastic analysis of Israel's successful businesses and how they happened to develop in such an adverse climate of being attacked by neighboring nations.  The country only has 7.1 million people and two years ago, when this was written, was only 60 years old.  It has produced more start up companies than large, peaceful and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the United Kingdom. Israel has more companies on the NASDAQ than any of the ones listed combined.   The authors found that it is the state of mind of the Israelis, and the fact that most all have had to serve in the IDF, have developed the ability to solve problems and think outside of the box.  Israelis have put Chutzpah first as an important skill.  They don't mind failing as this only adds to their learning so that they know what not to do next time.      The book came about from a class at Harvard where the students were trying to figure out Israel's successes.  They all went to Israel and learned first hand what made up the Israeli mind. They were business students wanting to reboot the USA economy and were seeking clues as to what caused Israel to be so successful, even though Israel's economy is in its infancy.      I enjoyed the book so much I bought another for my brother, a psychologist.  It's interesting to see that Israel's IDF does not work like our USA army.   They truly learn to think outside the box. This skill carries into their business world.  I think Edward de Bono, Prof. of Creative Thinking, could learn something from this book.
B003YLM780|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic.  It is a clean movie, with values like \\"helping your fellowman even in hard times\\".  It is a joy to watch time and again.

B003F3NDWG|3.0|[[ASIN:B003F3NDWG Castle: The Complete Second Season]]The DVD box set of Castle has very few extras compare to season One.  I was very disappointed that there was no audio commentary.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I've always been a fan of Eric and remember being blown away by some of the early Cream songs.  As of late, to enjoy his work you would need to see or buy one of his live performances.  This studio album is a good representation of how this terrific musician has matured.  It provides you with some really interesting, entertaining and novel blues tunes with hint of New Orleans jazz.   I highly recommend you add this cd to your Clapton collection.
1594484775|4.0|This is the first Nick Hornby novel I've read, and I was surprised by how thought-provoking and moving it was. Hornby has a reputation as a writer of easygoing, easy-to-read books, and \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is certainly an entertaining read. But it's also funny, smart about the role music can play in fans' lives, and compassionate toward characters uneasily navigating the challenges of middle age.  The relationship between Duncan and Annie is sharply drawn. They're just old enough to start recognizing that what they're living IS their life -- they're not still get ready to live it -- and to feel a bit dissatisfied and uncomfortable with the compromises they've made. For years Annie has tolerated Duncan's fixation on rock musician Tucker Crowe, who mysteriously dropped out of public view after the great success of his album \\"Juliet.\\" Duncan has channeled all his emotional energy into the website about Tucker that he has created, and spends more time communicating with fans across the globe than he does with Annie. For her part, Annie has not expressed her disappointment and has stayed with Duncan because it's the path of least resistance. Hornby does a masterful job of leavening the essential sadness of their relationship with humor, especially Annie's own thoughts about her relationship with Duncan and her reasons for staying in the fading seaside town where they live. Duncan's obsession with Tucker, and his conviction that he can assess people's intelligence and perhaps even their essential worth on the basis of their reaction to his music, is something any serious music fan will recognize (and shiver at). One of the questions \\"Juliet, Naked\\" explores is the line between appreciation and obsession and to what extent being a fan can become a substitute for living one's own life.  This could all have gotten ponderous in other hands, but Hornby keeps the story moving along smartly. When Duncan posts an ecstatic review of the stripped-down \\"Juliet\\" album (the \\"Juliet, Naked\\"of the title) on his webiste, Annie weighs in with her own review, strongly preferring the original version of the album. That these two characters end up learning more about each other's deepest thoughts through online postings than they have through face-to-face conversations is entirely believable. What happens next is a stretch, but a stretch in the best novelistic tradition, as relationships get shaken up and characters' inner lives rearranged.  \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is, among other things,  a loving but sharp-eyed exploration of what it means to be a music fan (or to love art in any form). It never feels as if Hornby is putting his characters down -- even Duncan is sympathetic. Rather, he seems to be encouraging readers to recognize that time passes by, all the time, and to focus on what's important while time is still left. That he manages this without getting boring or preachy is a real achievement.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive the new BluRay Alien Anthology as a gift and have been blown away by the initial viewing and features.  For those of you unfamiliar with the history of the Alien movies and their release onto viewable media, there have been several collections over the years, from laserdisc, to DVD, and to BluRay.  I, fortunately, have owned basically all of them and can tell you that this Anthology takes (almost) every feature and extra from the laserdiscs, Legacy DVDs, and Quadrilogy DVDs and presents them amazingly and fluidly.    The discs, presented in a great book-like box, have a reasonable loading time, but feature resume playback (thank you!) and a neat feature where you are able to switch discs without having to leave the menus and reload all the disclaimers etc.  This is such a time saver, as basically all my blurays have to be restarted, and do not feature resume.    The first movie looks and sounds phenomenal.  The transfer to HD is incredible in the detail but retains the grainy look at the same time.  The resolution is incredible as well, especially for a movie from 1979.  The transfer allows you to see every detail from the nasty film on the alien eggs to the details in the Nostromo.  I couldn't imagine a better viewing experience for such a movie.  Another great feature, brought from the Quadrilogy DVDs, is a little logo which you can have displayed during the deleted scenes when you choose to watch the director's cut rather than the theatrical cut.  The second film retains its distinctive look but like the first one has better resolution, colors, shadows, and a deep dark black.    The other two, while also HD, are more akin to their earlier DVD counterparts.    All in all, this is the collection for any Alien Fans.  I will still hold onto my Legacy and Quadrilogy DVDs, but this will be the one that I watch over and over.
045122499X|3.0|I expect a historical novel to be more than just one set at a certain point in history.<br /><br />In \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" Follett deftly wove the fortunes of Kingsbridge (the fictional town in which it was mainly set) and of the various members of its cast of characters into the great historical events of the time - such as the sinking of the White Ship, the Civil War that erupted after the death of King Henry I, the ascension of Henry II, the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket (of 'Murder in the Cathedral' fame), etc. History buffs who like to capitalize the \\"H\\" thrive off stuff like this.  It makes us want to go buy books on English History to read up on what really happened at that time.  It makes us want to read Eliot's \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\" to get a sense of what happened to create such a schism between Church and Palace.  And so on ...<br /><br />It is writing like that that makes historical fiction thrilling - there is a palette that already exists, and the author skilfully blends the story of seemingly ordinary people into it. Follett also coupled with \\"Pillars\\" a grand story of cathedral building, which awed even someone who is normally bored by discussions that are more at home in books on structural engineering.  \\"Pillars\\" was on par with \\"I, Claudius\\" and its more kitschy (but spellbinding nonetheless) cousin \\"The First Man in Rome.\\"<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" does not hurdle the bar that \\"Pillars\\" set.  There's lots of building and structural engineering, but very little of the part that makes Historical novels interesting to this reader.  There is a tease at the start of the novel, to create a link with the great succession battle of the day, replete with hints of royal intrigue.  But at the end of day, there isn't very much that's interesting.  The Plague does make it in to the story, but in a very non-gripping fashion, as do some campaigns in France.<br /><br />That said, the core story is good.  It is well-written, with interesting characters - especially its leading female protagonist, who would have been considered \\"forward\\" in the 1960s, let alone in 14th century England.  The length of the book did not bother me - in fact, I was happy for it, since it gave me something to look forward to doing for several evenings after putting family to bed.  And it did inspire me to go to Wikipedia to read up on some of the Kings of that time.  But all in all, I was disappointed, compared to the thrill that \\"Pillars\\" gave me.
0765326353|5.0|Let me first start by saying that I don't write many reviews. Generally when I like a book others with far better review ability have already said everything I could want to say about the book better than I could. I'm an avid reader, especially Fantasy-type books. Some of my favorites: George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice, Wheel of Time, anything by Brent Weeks. That should give you a good idea of the type of book I enjoy. Another reason I mentioned those author's is that if you enjoy their work I think you'll really, really like this. An important thing to remember when reading is that this is the first book in a 10 book series. However, from the intense and mysterious Prologue that sets this book up, I was hooked. I found the 3 main characters Dalinar, Kaladin, and Shallan extremely well-written and interesting. I also really enjoyed the character of Jasnah, she's just too cool. The book has a lot of exposition and back story, but the last third picks up and the final chapters leave you with your jaw-dropping and wanting, no, NEEDING the next book to get here QUICKLY! LOL. I honestly enjoyed this book, the characters, and the story so much that I wasn't that excited when Towers of Midnight came out. I had originally planned to take a break wherever I was in \\"Way of Kings\\" and start reading \\"TofM\\" but was so engrossed that \\"TofM\\" got put on the bookshelf. Overall, I highly recommend this book if you liked the other series I mentioned and I honestly believe this series will go down as one of the all-time fantasy greats next to A Song of Fire and Ice and the Wheel of Time.
B002Z58GQI|2.0|I bought 2 of these (the old model, so maybe they fixed some things with this new version, I don't know). The first one lasted 6 months then just died. The second one is still going, but the metal USB connector on it is loose and it is hard to get a good connection. Bottom line ... I will have to replace this one too very soon because I don't think I can rely on it to function all the time.    It looks like a great deal for the price, but it doesn't have the durability to stand up over time and you might need to replace it fairly quickly. So is that a bargain or should you just pony up a little bit more for something that will last a while longer? Your call.

0142000671|5.0|I'll say it right up front: If you can read this classic novel without shedding a tear, you are one hardcore, cold, heartless person.<br /><br />Since nearly every kid had to read this one in school, do I really have to give a synopsis of the plot? Okay, just in case: During the Depression, two displaced workers find themselves landing a job on a ranch in California. One of these workers is George Milton, bright but down on his luck. The other workers is Lennie Small, a huge ox of a man who also happens to be mentally disabled. George and Lennie are best friends, with George looking out for Lennie in hopes of keeping the simple-minded fellow out of trouble.<br /><br />Unfortunately, keeping Lennie out of trouble is easier said than done.<br /><br />I'll leave off any further synopsis, for those who have not had the joy of reading this novel. It's truly an American classic that everyone should read.<br /><br />Steinbeck is definitely an opinionated writer, and I've always felt he did a good job of presenting his views without slamming the reader over the head with them. Others, generally those diametrically opposed to Steinbeck's views, often say otherwise. I consider myself middle-of-the-road socio-politically, so maybe that's why I feel the way I do.
031603438X|5.0|What a fun biography! What a life!<br /><br />Keith Richards is definitely my favorite heroin addict, ever.<br /><br />Random observations:<br /><br />--He refreshingly avoids recovery-speak in discussing his legendary drug abuse.  Consequently this may be one of the best firsthand accounts of it ever written - clear, plain, detailed. I'd rather read this than Aldous Huxley or The Beats. While not encouraging anyone else to try it, he doesn't apologize or lather on phony regrets . He enjoyed it while he did it.  A lot of it was just business for touring musicians - something to get you up for the next show on your grueling schedule,  and something to mellow off the first drug's hard edges after the show. He figures he stayed alive because he used pure products (often obtained, albeit illegally, from prescriptions in England, where it was legal), and was meticulous about not overdoing it. There's a jolly scene where he describes himself cutting Turkish heroin exactly 97 to 3. Not 96 to 4.<br /><br />-- He's down to earth. More genuine in some ways than Jagger, whom he faults for accepting a knighthood after playing the rebel his entire life. (A class thing perhaps: Jagger the middle-class, good-student striver ultimately wanting acceptance by the elites; Richards the son of a factory worker, knowing that's not his bag and not really wanting it.) He'd rather hang with musicians, particularly good ones, than the jet set and Eurotrash.<br /><br />--He never turns to Buddhism, rants about politics or devotes himself to saving the planet. For this alone I'd lionize him.<br /><br />-- Richards prefers the band to the solo; for him the big moment is when the sound blends and you can't tell who's playing what. He likes hanging with his best buds, most of whom have been in jail. He's comfortable with black people in contexts most whites never reach - Rastafarians in remote villages where most white people would get shot, all-night parties with black musicians on the other side of the tracks after shows in the still-segregated South.<br /><br />--He really has led a charmed life, wriggling out of numerous busts where they had him cold - in Canada, Honolulu, Arkansas, and England. He's also survived auto wrecks and fires, physical mayhem and rioting English teenage girls, whom he regarded as scarier than the cops who staked him out for years trying to catch him with drugs.<br /><br />--Oh my God: all the women. Sigh. It's good to be king.<br /><br />Now for the pontificating. This is one of the most important books in rock history in recent years. Popular culture knows a hell of a lot about the Beatles but far less about the Stones. What folks know about them,  they tend to know about Jagger instead of Richards. And what they know about Richards is disproportionately his indestructibility in the face of unbelievable drug abuse.<br /><br />Which is a pity. Let's not forget that the Rolling Stones were there at the conception, just like the Beatles. Teenyboppers rioted for them, just like for the Beatles.  In 1964, two British polls showed them more popular than the Fab Four. Their rise was seen as heralding the Apocalypse, probably more so than the Beatles. Stones mania in England caught up with the Beatles by 1964 or 1965. The two bands would coordinate their singles' releases so as not to step on each other's hits. By the age of peak cultural and political rebellion, the Beatles were already breaking up while the Stones were just hitting their stride.<br /><br />While Lennon and McCartney were the latest pop-standard immortals, the Stones saw themselves as bluesmen. They singlehandedly brought the legacy of the Chicago blues to an enormous worldwide audience, reviving many blues careers.  Their merging of early rock and roll and Chicago blues created what you today think of as rock - that big pounding sound filling stadiums. No one has ever surpassed them in its execution. Richards refers to them without braggadocio as the world's greatest rock and roll band, and that's true.<br /><br />So much of that can be attributed to Richards, their guitarist for half a century. He was never a glossy pop celebrity.  He had bad teeth. He never came across as a virtuoso a la Clapton or Hendrix. But he and Charlie Watts were - I'm stealing a phrase from the book here - the band's engine house, while Jagger sang and danced out front, the band's public face.<br /><br />Richards was mesmerized during youth by the blues, but unlike a lot of older blues purists, he also loved  rock and roll. The band's early insistence on playing it raised hackles among their base of blues fans; Richards parallels this to folkie disapproval of rock and roll. Richards, Jagger and Brian Jones spent two or three years in poverty singlemindedly pursuing the blues. They dissected every record they could find to replicate its sounds. And they really got it. Early American audiences hearing them on the radio couldn't tell if they were white or black. Richards' life changed when he first heard Elvis singing &#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; on a crackling Radio Luxemburg broadcast, but it was Elvis's guitarist Scotty Moore he really idolized.<br /><br />He describes how music is made, how he and Jagger wrote songs, how a sound was achieved, recording tricks. His discovery of five-string tuning - removing a guitar's lowest string and tuning the others like a banjo - changed the Stones' sound.<br /><br />The personal data intrigues, and not just the inside dope on his relationships with Ronnie Spector, Anita Pallenberg, Patti Hansen, Uschi Obermaier and others. Readers may be surprised to learn Richards was a devoted Boy Scout patrol leader and thinks it shaped him into someone who could run a band. Or that he was in a prize-winning boys choir. Or that he was nervous approaching women. Or that in later life he's become a devoted reader, preferring history (World War II, the Romans) Patrick O'Brian's &#34;Master and Commander&#34; series, and George MacDonald Fraser's &#34;Flashman&#34; books. (I salute his excellent taste.)<br /><br />The way to view his life is this: it's not a recommendation to everyone else to screw countless women, including gorgeous models, beautiful revolutionaries, black strippers, groupies and bankers' wives. It's not a recommendation to lead a jangled lifestyle for decades abusing every drug available while putting in recording studio sessions measured in days, not hours, without sleep.<br /><br />Richards is, more or less, a god in the Greek sense, and we marvel at him because he does things that most of us can't or don't really want to. He's unkillable. He's mega-talented, fabulously rich and famous. He has lived a charmed existence by his own rules. But this life killed or destroyed many around him weaker, less lucky or talented than he. Brian Jones was gone by 1969. Richards is the exception that proves these rules. That's the role of gods and kings.<br /><br />Don't try this at home. But it's sure fun to read about.lf a century. He was never a glossy pop celebrity.  He had bad teeth.

0684830485|4.0|Set during the Spanish American War of the 1930s, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about an American sent on a mission to help guerrilla fighters blow up a bridge.<br /><br />There. That's the basic plot. It sounds like something out a an action movie, doesn't it. To stop there, however, would be doing the novel and the author a grave disservice.<br /><br />When it gets down to it, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about death and how to face it. The men on this secret bridge-exploding mission are going to die, and they know it. They will not be coming back from this mission. Each of them will be facing death one way or another, and they each have to deal with it individually. The idea of suicide is even approached from a soldier's point of view; the question is raised, is it preferable to kill oneself than to be captured by the enemy?<br /><br />For Whom the Bell Tolls also touches upon racism and politics, though not strictly from an American point of view.<br /><br />Within this tale, violence is to be found in spades, but this is not a simple action story. This is true literature, told in the best writing Hemingway ever did (yes, I admit that's arguable, but it's my opinion ... believe what you want).<br /><br />As a writer, is there anything not to learn from Hemingway? The man knew how to write tense scenes and deal with weighty subject matters all while using as few words as possible, and most of those short words. No other author in my experience has quite been able to do that.<br /><br />As an aside, I'll admit that every time I read a Hemingway novel, I always hate it. Until I reach the very last page. Then suddenly I love it. Not sure why that is, but it's always been my reaction.
0142428272|4.0|Excellent historical fiction - based on facts.  Very interesting!!  Totally enjoyed the book.  Classic and vintage Follett
0786860707|3.0|The material in this book is fantastic. It's stuffed full of insight, anecdotes, and beautiful artwork.  However, the binding is extremely cheap, not able to support the weight of the book.  I, like a lot of people, tend to read while laying down in bed, and the spine of cover ripped right off the book within the first 100 pages of reading.  It seems to me that if you're going to make a book that's this heavy, it needs some extra strength in the binding.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I thougt this was a pretty good movie even though it was alot like the original.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Love the series. The difference from the dvd is minimal because it was filmed with a grainy quality, still it is awesome... The quality does improve
B002ZHKZEM|2.0|I, like most Whovians, was more than just a little disappointed that there would only be five special episodes of Doctor Who produced in 2009, instead of a full season of thirteen episodes. But by the end of the year, with 2010 and a new Doctor right around the corner, it finally registered just how disappointing the year had been.    The first special, \\"The Next Doctor,\\" teases the audience with a glimpse of the next Doctor, however, (spoilers ahead!) it's just a cop-out, as the so-called \\"next Doctor\\" is simply a man who thinks he's the Doctor. It's still a fun little romp through Victorian London with the Doctor and his addled would-be doppelganger facing off against the Cybermen, at least for the first half or so, before leading into a climax involving a giant Cyberman that was so ridiculous that Steven Moffat had to explicitly retcon it away in Series 5. Watch the first half-hour, turn it off, and make up your own ending.    The second special, \\"Planet of the Dead,\\" is dull and boring, featuring a bunch of flat characters trapped on a bus with the Doctor in the middle of a desert planet. The Doctor must get the bus and its passengers back to Earth before a swarm of space-locusts devour them. Although it has a few nice little bits with UNIT near the end, don't even waste your time with this one. Skip the whole thing and just imagine a better Easter special instead.    \\"The Waters of Mars\\" is a sharp turn from the previous specials, in that it's actually worth watching in its entirety. The Doctor finds himself on Mars and encounters a doomed interplanetary expedition. How does he know it's doomed? Because he read it on future-Wikipedia or something. While the base is terrorized by a virulent microscopic organism that turns its hosts into water-spewing zombies, the Doctor has to grapple with the tough decision of whether he has the right to change the outcome of a supposedly-fixed event in history. The climax, in which the Doctor goes mad with power after saving the crew of the expedition, is absolutely gripping, though resolved far too quickly. Overall, this special made me feel excited for the upcoming \\"End of Time\\" special...    ...which was garbage. The Master is resurrected by a nefarious cult, but things go horribly wrong and he's left as a deranged shadow of his former self who can shoot lightning out of his hands like Emperor Palpatine, leap tall quarries in a single bound, and chew both scenery and people. (Yeah, he eats people now. Roger Delgado is spinning in his grave.) The Doctor teams up with Wilfred Noble and comes face to face with the Master, the Time Lords (led by a rejuvenated, scenery-chomping Rassilon), and with his own mortality in a jumbled mess of a two-parter. The writing feels first-draft quality at best, and we go from setpiece to setpiece with no logical progression. Even with saliva-spewing Rassilon and Super Saiyan Master (among other disasters), this turd would have been so much better if it had been more polished. Watch every scene with the Doctor and Wilfred for some touching character moments, then fast-forward straight to the Tenth Doctor's moving (if a bit on the long side) regeneration scene and the subsequent first appearance of Matt Smith as the new Doctor. Just use your imagination for everything in between, as anything you imagine would undoubtedly end up better than what actually happened.    David Tennant does his best with what he's given to work with and is fantastic as always (he will be sorely missed, and I eagerly await the next multi-Doctor reunion special), but this collection clearly shows that head writer Russel T. Davies had worn out his welcome by the end. Avoid wasting money on this set, unless you just have to have a complete collection of NuWho.
B00402FGE4|5.0|This is a fantastic show.  Up to the Stargate standard. Looking forward to many more seasons.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Let's face it, we were all skeptical of Matt Smith. How could a young nobody be the Doctor after David Tennant had defined the role for a generation? Luckily for us, and for the franchise, Matt Smith proved to be absolutely incredible in his role, and has re-defined the Doctor! Smith has a decided alien-ness to him, completely different to Tennant's more anguished and angsty humanity. In his mannerisms, he brings about an innate sense of being older than his appearance would suggest, sometimes as crotchety as Hartnell and sometimes as paternal as Pertwee, while still only being a few years older than fan unfavorite Doctor Colin Baker was when he took the role. Smith also models himself on Tom Baker, regarded by many to be the best Doctor ever, and Patrick Troughton, and his synthesis is simply sublime. Smith is, like all great Doctors, a delight to watch.    Now let's get to the writing and episodes. Russel T. Davies has left, and the new showrunner is Steven Moffat, mastermind behind some of the greatest episodes of the NuWho. This is a new, more refined version of the show in many ways. The production values feel higher, although there are some hilariously bad special effects (but, then again, what is Doctor Who without bad special effects?) here and there. Series composer Murray Gold is more restrained and less melodramatic and bombastic in his scoring, although the soundtrack is still pure Gold--possibly his best score yet--and the writing is much more refined. It's not perfect--for example, the Dalek episode feels rushed and should have been a two-parter, whereas the Silurian episode was plodding and should have been a one-parter--but Steven Moffat is shaping up to be the best head writer since Robert Holmes.    Now, a rundown of the episodes:    1. The Eleventh Hour: Our madcap introduction to Eleven and new companion Amy Pond. Fast, fun, and with tantalizing hints at a season-long story arc.    2. The Best Below: A solid episode filled with fun and frights, even if the ending lacks subtlety. Also contains a great segue into the next episode...    3. Victory of the Daleks: Though this Dalek-centric episode is highly polarizing and the climax and conclusion to the episode feels rushed and sloppy (hence the need for a two-parter), it's still a decent episode, with Winston Churchill!    4/5. The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone: The return of Moffat's pet monsters, the Weeping Angels, and of River Song at her smuggest. Though the Angels' MO is different from their first appearance, this is a tense and thrilling two-parter that is to Series 3's \\"Blink\\" what \\"Aliens\\" was to \\"Alien.\\"    6. Vampires in Venice: The Doctor does his best to prevent Amy from falling in love with him by taking her and her fiance Rory to Venice. Unfortunately, there are vampire fish-people there. A fun, if mediocre episode.    7. Amy's Choice: The Doctor, Amy, and Rory must determine the difference between fantasy and reality while fighting against a caustic, sardonic enemy agent known as the Dream Lord before time runs out. A tense, fun episode with a great villain.    8/9. The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood: This two-parter re-introduces the Silurians and is made in the vein of a Third Doctor/UNIT episode from the '70s--that is to say, it's twice as long as it needs to be and slow-paced. Though somewhat unremarkable, the last ten minutes contain a shocking twist that's not to be missed.    10. Vincent and the Doctor: The Doctor and Amy visit Vincent van Gogh and fight an invisible monster only he can see. The monster is so poorly-CGI'd that it's almost embarrassing (which is why it should have been kept invisible), and is so ancillary to the plot that it could have been left out entirely. The real draw of this episode is the pathos-driven interactions between the Doctor and van Gogh, culminating in a tearjerking finale.    11. The Lodger: An Amy-light episode that's not as bad as it sounds. Separated from his TARDIS, the Doctor moves in with a mediocre guy(played by a mediocre comedian who, thankfully, is not the comic relief of this episode) in order to investigate a space-time disturbance. A surprising funny episode!    12/13. The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang: The entire universe is at stake as the grand story arc Moffat has been building up to reaches its climax. This finale is different from anything seen in NuWho, with a kind of restraint that was missing from Russel T. Davies' cheesy finales and enough masterful foreshadowing throughout the season to make every theme, every motif of the season build up to the incredible, mind-blowing finale. This is something unprecedented in the new series, I'll leave it at that!    Overall, Series 5 has its highs and lows, but unlike the past four series, the lows are simply mediocre. No farting aliens, no \\"Love and Monsters,\\" no \\"Last of the Time Lords,\\" no faux-regeneration, no \\"End of Time.\\" Whereas Russel T. Davies' era was marred by episodes so bad it made me almost ashamed to enjoy Doctor Who, Moffat's era is, so far, characterized by episodes so good it makes me feel a childlike sense of wonder and enthusiasm I though I'd long outgrown. Let's hope he and Matt Smith can keep up the good work! All Hail Grand Moff Steven!
B002ZG981E|5.0|One of the best, and original movies I have seen in a very long time.
142311339X|5.0|When I first heard that Rick Riordan was writing another series about Camp Half Blood, I prepared myself to be disappointed.  It's often hard for the next book in a series to be as good as the first one, much less for a sequel to a series (I'm not sure that's the right phrase) to be as good as the original series.  But Riordan more than meets the challenge.  This new Olympian series is a perfect continuation of the original one.<br /><br />In The Lost Hero we meet three of the seven mentioned in the prophecy: Jason, who has no memory of his life before he wakes up on a school bus with Piper, who has the gift of persuasion, and Leo who is more than handy with his hands. As is the case with heroes, things get off to a rocky start and the trio soon finds themselves battling monsters before being transported to Camp Half Blood where they will learn their true identities and begin to prepare for their quest.<br /><br />Riordan keeps things fast paced and suspenseful. The gods, especially Hera, know what is going on, but no one is willing to share that information with our heroes. Never fear, this intrepid trio does not let that slow them down.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Percy and his adventures or if you enjoy mythology, this new series is a must read.  One of the things I enjoy about Riordan's work is that it inspires me (and I've had students say this is true for them as well) to do a little research to refresh my memory on mythology.  Any book that students not only enjoy but encourages them to learn more is a definite winner.<br /><br />Recommended for Grades 4 and up. (Even if you are an adult, you might consider reading this series. Not only will you be up to date on what the kids are reading, but you just might enjoy yourself.)
0312945973|1.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed several of Smith's books.  But not this one.  Historical fiction can be fun.  Fantasy can be fun. But why the author chose to take an era that had real history, real people and real rulers and then make up some crazy non-historical jibberish to fill it is beyond me.  I was terribly disappointed and am sorry I bothered to read it. I prefer to recall the author whose work I enjoyed prior to running across this random mishmash.
0316077054|4.0|Beautiful Creatures (Caster Chronicles, #1) is one of my all-time favorite stories, so I couldn't wait to get lost in this book.<br /><br />I sincerely love the world Kami and Maggie have created. Amazing characters, unique settings, mysterious and suspenseful enough to keep me pining for it every time I had to put it down.<br /><br />In this sequel I missed the romance between Ethan and Lena. Although there were new relationships budding (some I'm not so happy about) there were no fireworks. I know this is part of the plot and wholly intentional, but the romance was one of the reasons I LOVE Beautiful Creatures.<br /><br />To make up for it, there is SO much more paranormal! We get to learn more about not only the Casters, but the Keepers, the Incubuses, the Greats, and a Wayward (shhh)!<br /><br />At times I felt like the story flow was a bit choppy; definitely NOT 'Bad\\", but just difficult to follow. This didn't effect the thrill of the tale, but did make me slow down and re-read paragraphs in a few spots.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great modern-day southern paranormal adventure with beautiful creatures as well as beautiful darkness (and beautiful Ethan, too).
0345509617|5.0|This is a perfect companion to the Making of Star Wars book. Very in depth and great to read transcripts from the original Arnold interviews that weren't included in the paperback making of book. I wish they would've gone a bit deeper into the financial issues, at times it felt a little glossed over, but they've been documented in other places. I would've also loved to see some of the photos larger than what they were presented, but that's the fanboy in me wanting to make out all the detail. Can't  wait for a Making of Jedi!!
B0041BQ5KS|5.0|I thought that babies were taken care of the same ways all around the globe...  The caring love of a mother as in fact several translations.  So nice, so beautiful, so real.  Thank you.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|Was first introduced to 5FDP this year starting with War Is The Answer and loved it so much that I bought this CD too.  Well this one is definitely a heavier CD with powerful and generally angry lyrics and I love it even more than War!  I love the in your face, get out of my way attitude in the music!      The only complaint I have is that they have not released more music!  Get to work guys we want to hear MORE!  I blame these guys for blowing my speakers and now my ears are ringing all the time!  Sucks to get old!
B003UHYSDK|5.0|I love the growth of this band. From Black Mountain through In the Future to this new album, I like the expansion of their sound. Evolution implies some kind of improvement, but that's not the case: the previous albums were excellent. This album is definitely more straight-edged, a rock album with driving songs like Let Spirits Ride and slower, heavier tracks like Rollercoaster. However, the gorgeous harmony and counterpoint of Stephen McBean and Amber Webber's vocals comes to the fore more than in previous albums (on tracks like Buried by the Blues) like a heavier version of The Decemberists (but not like the heavenly power of Kylesa). There's an awesome 70s feel all over this album with the right amount fuzz in the guitar and great layering of organ and synth. A really great album, and one of my best of 2010 so far.
B000BGH22W|3.0|I like Doyle's flighty tone for this score, but I hate the fact that there's very little subtlety. It's just so noisy and simple. Where's the complexity of John Williams? The whole score pretty much uses the same beat and it grows tiresome after a while.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I've never written a review before, but I just needed to say this book is SO GOOD... I mean, I loved the Percy Jackson series. It opened my eyes to greek mythology, which I now love. Well, The Lost Hero is doing that to me again, but with roman mythology. I just can't wait to read the next one.    Don't think too much about it. Just get the book. You won't regret it.

1400052173|5.0|This book is amazing and I couldn't put it down. How tragic for this family to discover their mother had been violated this way and yet, phenomenal good has come from it. A great read recommended by my brother who is an avid Amazon book customer.
006176759X|5.0|This book is an easy read, I generally do not have time to read and this book moves along smoothly. I must say that being a fan of \\"The Hills\\" I was looking for something that would keep that naughty obsession going. The books story line was perfect for that hunger.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The reason I purchased Supernatural Season 5 is the 4th season was so strong and it hasn't reached New Zealand telly yet.I've been fan of the show from the very beginning and it just keeps getting better and better.  I must've watched the entire season in a couple of days and it had me enthralled from the very first episode \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\".  The highlights of the season would have of been \\"The End\\",\\"Abandon All Hope\\",\\"Fallen Idols\\" and \\"The Song Remains The Same\\"  Guest Star Paris Hilton was a laugh when she turned around to Sam joked about \\"The House Of Wax\\"which we all know that her and Jared Padaleki were in together.  All in all a great season to wrap up Eric Kripke's mammoth saga.  I just hope that Season 6 is just as good and Seson 7 if they go on to make it.I will be tuned in with baited breath and relish in the adventutres of the Winchesters.

B001EYU1VO|3.0|I was excited when I first noticed this product. I quickly ordered one, attracted by the twist-rudder axis, and dual throttle control built in. For the programming and functions, I only use it in one fighter/combat game, and, as others have stated before, there is no generic programming set-up, it is different for every game.    I do also like the ability to adjust the angle/rake/slope of this, the height, and a few other fine tuning adjustments, and the fact that there are multiple keys, a hat controller, and scroll wheel (handy for flap control); the fact that the controller can be broken down, and made easy(-ier) for storage and/or transport, and the dual throttle control has a lock for individual, or solo use.    The REAL downside to my review centers (<--pun) around the Z-Axis/Twist/Rudder control. Within a week or 2 of ownership, the sensors were shot, and even when my craft was set to auto-pilot (without me toughing the flight stick) the craft would wildly, and violently bounce back and forth as the rudders would flail back and forth. I did not get very far with tech support, my e-mail got returned almost a month after it was sent, and I had given up by that point, and disabled the rudder axis controls.    So, aside from that one main issue (and that one of the buttons broke off within the first week), I still use this controller, since I did not want to have to eat the cost of shipping it back to Saitek, and be out of a controller for an unknown time period.    I would be on the line about referring someone else to purchase this.
0312600844|2.0|Plowed through two hundred pages of Franzen's latest book and decided, why bother? I read glowing reviews and wanted to find the nugget(s) that would keep me at a tedious book whose characters are basically one-dimensional. Was at the same time re-reading Updike's Run Rabbit and said to myself, \\"Now that's a book that speaks about the American character, the angst, confusion, disillusionment of our times.\\"
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I couldn't agree any more with the review above mine. I personally love zombie movies but this show goes along a different route. It's not simply action with shooting and killing zombie after zombie from what I've seen, this show actually has feeling and emotion behind it (family drama etc.)! Here that moms? This is a heartfelt show that you would probably enjoy watching with your kids, after all...it's rated TV-14. The kids probably won't be up to see it because it's on at 10pm but you can still enjoy it! Oh hell, I'll admit it...it even almost made me cry a couple times! BEAUTIFUL!
B002ZG98XW|5.0|Just saw it and it is the Absolute Best movie I have ever seen in all of my life. The slated dvd release date is set for February 1st, 2011.....counting down already..
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Seeing is believing, this Blu Ray is breathtaking in so many scenes. The scenes in the Abbey were so crisp I felt like I was 10 again seeing the film for the first time on the big screen in an early 70s revival. Salzburg has never looked this good. You can even see the delicate patterns in the tweed jackets.   The audio is music to the ears (don't shoot me for the bad pun please). The 5:1 sounds studio quality again.   Did anyone else have a crush on Christopher Plummer the first time you saw the movie?

The Blade Itself probably deserves a 4.5 star, rather than a 4 star, rating. Briefly, the story takes place in a medieval setting, as fantasy novels so often do, taking place primarily in a large kingdom (called the Union) and tracks the various characters as the nation moves towards war with the barbarian tribes of the north. All the while, the apparently evil empire in the south has a new emperor who is eager to regain that which the empire lost to the Union in a previous war. In all, it's a fairly standard fantasy set up. Where the novel excels, however, is in the characters and the execution.    The characters were truly my favorite part of the Blade Itself. For the most part, the characters are extremely realistic - none are entirely good, none are entirely evil. Most of them are arguably bad people, or at least have done many terrible things in the past, but at the same time, they are all decidedly human. They have weaknesses, strengths, hopes and fears. Glokta, for example, was a rising star in the Union army, a noble of good blood, a champion fencer, etc., etc. but was captured and tortured during war with the southern empire. He emerged crippled, constantly in pain, and took a position as a government inquisitor, whose occupation typically involves torturing suspected criminals into confessing to crimes they may or may not have committed. He is truly a tortured soul - he's utterly miserable and seems to hate everything, including himself.     Another character that I found particularly appealing is that of Logen Ninefingers. Logen is in some ways the prototypical barbarian fantasy character. A great warrior, brutal, typically ruthless, uncouth, etc. But he's been through so many battles and lost so much that he's become a reluctant warrior. Indeed, despite the fact that he is a tremendous killer, he's probably the closest thing to a decent personin the novel. Abercrombie develops his characters nicely. Even those which initially seem like the proverbial one-trick pony, such as Jezal, show growth.    Another major strength of the Blade Itself is in Abercrombie's writing. Although he's capable of writing some fine descriptive narrative, he typically leaves a lot to the imagination of the reader. I'm not sure I could really describe the physical appearance of most of the characters. Personally, I like that. I don't think we typically need to know every minute detail of a characters appearance. This same minimalism is extended to scenery, buildings, battles, etc. He tells as at least as much as we need to know, sometimes more, but rarely burdens us with excessive detail. One particularly strength of the writing, in my opinion, lies in the fact that Abercrombie tailors each chapter to the character who is narrating that chapter. For example, a Logen chapter will be much gruffer, rife with some odd grammatical choices, some slang, etc. A Glokta chapter will seem much bitterer, rife with sarcastic thoughts. Although many authors write different chapters from different perspectives, few show a demonstrable difference in the writing style dependent on the character. It's rather unique and definitely well done.    Abercrombie also injects a fair bit of sarcastic humor into the novel. It's rarely laugh out loud (though some of the descriptions of the barbarian, Logen, exploring the great modernized city were pretty darn funny). Abercrombie's wit is similar to that of Douglas Adams (though certainly not in the same ball park quality-wise). It's definitely worth a chuckle here and there. Finally, as far as writing is concerned, I think Abercrombie writes much more realistic fight scenes than most authors. Most fantasy fight scenes seem to involve two classy swords man who fight epic duel with grace and dignity.  Abercrombie imagines (and, I think, rightfully so) his fight scenes as brutal fights to the death. Characters cheat, fight dirty, do whatever they can to survive. It's a refreshing change in the fantasy panorama.    If I have any complaint about the Blade Itself is that its plot is really nothing unique or special. As I said above, the plot is pretty much standard fantasy fare. Civilized kingdom deals with a barbarian invasion, with a dark, evil empire looming in the shadows. In that regard, the first novel is somewhat predictable. There aren't any real twists or turns, no major surprises. From what I understand, the subsequent novels become more unpredictable, however. My other major criticism is that, well, not a whole lot really happens in the Blade Itself. It reads as one long, extended introduction. This makes sense, of course, because the trilogy was originally intended as one novel and was broken into three. But the novel is basically all setup, introduction and development. The plot doesn't really advance until the last couple hundred pages.    In sum, the Blade Itself is really good and the series has a ton of potential. If the next two books pick up the pace, and the plot starts to unfold in more unpredictable ways, the First Law trilogy could be truly special. The best thing I can ever say about a book is that I want to read more. Well, I do. I finished the Blade Itself and ordered the next two books in the series within an hour. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. You won't regret it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I would never find a book that I would love as much as I enjoyed reading the Twilight book.  This was an excellent and easy read.. I totally recommend this book.  I am currently half way through the second book \\"Catching Fire\\" and I am loving that one as well.  So far the first book is my favorite.
B004132HZS|5.0|I have been frustrated for the longest time with regard to adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories that don't stay true to the general spirit of the books. Typically, Holmes and Watson are cast much too old. Watson is always some bumble-brained goofball who just tags along for the ride, almost like a comic sidekick to ask the \\"stupid\\" questions that most people would ask of a brilliant mind like that possessed by Sherlock Holmes. As if Holmes would have the patience to deal with such an idiot?! And the story lines are nearly always garbled beyond recognition.    But anyone who has read even one of the stories knows that these other adaptations, while they may have some fine acting and story-telling going on, fall far from the flavor of the written works. Holmes is sarcastic, socially-inept (most of the time), methodical, more than a touch OCD, etc. Watson is health-conscious, a good doctor, not an idiot, fishes Holmes out of serious trouble on more than one occasion, and has taken it upon himself to chronicle what he sees as the brilliant career of his friend, Holmes.    Though this contemporary adaptation does not stick to the letter of the books, it is fantastic, and that's coming from someone who gets really irritated when movie adaptations stray too far from the details of a well-written story. My only (mild) source of irritation is that Watson doesn't have his hand gun until the third episode. While the details from the stories are present to some degree, they are sometimes mixed up a bit. But there has obviously been a sincere effort made to stick to the feel of the original stories, which is why I am happy to give a five-star review.
B0025KW29U|2.0|I generally love all things Joss Whedon and didn't hesitate to order this when it was released on blu-ray. I watched it and surprisingly was disappointed. Looking over the zillion 5-star ratings, I'm obviously alone. I found it kind of boring despite really liking the cast. I felt disconnected rather than endeared by the absurdity of it all. The abrupt ending was the nail in the coffin. I'll certainly give it a second spin and hopefully I'll finally see why folks are heaping praise.
7885142450|5.0|Definitely not the official release for American audiences, but really really well done. It would not work in my DVD player, but my Apple PowerBook played it just fine; I have a large screen so it was not a big deal. English translation is a bit funny, but expected with this type of version. Just happy to not have to wait until the official version is released. If this version is available for the 3rd movie before American companies get their act together I will buy from them again!
B001IA2PTK|2.0|Indy, Indy, Indy...or better yet, Lucas and Spielberg how did you go wrong? The first thought that comes to mind if you read that first line is that I am going to rip this INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL a new one. I am afraid that I am going to be that guy in the room or that guy on those message boards who seems to disagree with everybody when it comes to the newest installment of the INDIANA JONES saga. I will be as honest as I can and explain where I am coming from without revealing too much. I am basing my evaluation of this movie on the three that have come before it. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and THE LAST CRUSADE are all classics. Some might argue that RAIDERS is the best of the series and I couldn't agree more, but I am noticing that with every new installment, something is missing. The story is not as strong, substance is out the door and the wow factor(special effects) is brought in to mesmerize the crowds. I guess this time around, Spielberg and company ran out of substance and wow factor; and realized, in the middle of the shoot, that it is no easy task to duplicate the originality, the wonder or the spectacle of the first movie. They move on ahead anyway and give us this movie that feels more like a nostalgia piece, than a solid entry in the franchise.  The movie starts off with our favorite archeologist, in a tight situation, as usual; but this time around the Russians are the bad guys with Cate Blanchett as their typical leader whose stares are more of an effective weapon than this supernatural ability bestowed upon her by Spielberg. I guess if that talent had actually worked there would be no need for old INDIANA. Dr. JONES played by Harrison Ford is older in this new movie; a relic of the 40's stuck in the new and convoluted world of the 50's stuffed with  everything from Elvis Presley to  Communist paranoia, the nuclear bomb, Area 51, spies, men in black , hot rods and greasers. Indy looked like he had been transported to our time period in a key scene at the beginning of the movie. You won't forget the perilous moment, I assure you. That scene sets the tone and shows that a new dawn in warfare was definitely upon the world. On that note, this is where all of my problems with this movie start. Where are the other perilous moments? Where is the escape by the skin of your teeth moments that this franchise is known for? After the scene that I make reference to, there is no real hold your breath, grab your arm chair moment. INDY 4 feels like it was going through the motions, giving us action scenes with no heart and bigger than life visuals that would have been much more impressive if the climax was not so sluggish and all too familiar.  In this movie, Spielberg and company did not follow my golden rule for making a sequel \\"Go with what works\\". They have been following the road map they have laid since Raiders and it has worked for all three previous movies. It's simple: Action, then talk, more action then more talk, back to the action and finally the climax. Keep the audience stimulated throughout the whole experience. This is the first time in an Indiana Jones movie that the whole thing comes to a halt. Nothing was happening. They start talking about the skulls and then we go to South America, fight some second rate bad guys, find the crystal skull, then Indy's old flame and his  mentor. That was a big whole chunk of the movie with nothing really exciting happening. There were some comedic moments along the way, but the thrills were definitely absent. When the action finally starts, it looks like Deja Vue.How many times are you going to give us the chase/fight scene before you try something different Mr. Spielberg and Lucas? I mean all tree movies have the bad guys chasing Indy in their trucks only to have him jump from his vehicle to beat the crap out of them. They were in the Amazon for goodness sake; Why not a boat fight this time? If you are going to do the same thing atleast try to do better than the last three pictures. Surpass what you've done before or do as good. The chase scene felt like it was put together by a first time director trying to imitate Spielberg's work. The action was happening, but the wit and the thrills, like I said, were somehow non existent. Not until the tenth minute mark before the ending, we get a new twist on the old Indy going toe to toe with the big bad guy who seems to beat the hell out of him first. You won't forget that scene with its voracious extras. I can already hear some fans saying that this movie is as good as Raiders of the lost Ark. What? Did they see the movie I saw? Because it is Spielberg, he gets a free pass? If somebody else was at the helm of this project, moviegoers would have canned this picture.   I really do think Lucas and Spielberg could have given us more and push the limit of their creativity, instead of relying on the love of the character to fill the seats at the movie theater. With so much competition out there, like a National Treasure, for example, which touches on the same subject(action, adventure); Spielberg and Lucas needed to show the younglings who is the best and why they are the best. I predict there will be a debate over this movie for years to come, and it will be between those who just wanted to see Harrison Ford with his famous hat one last time and those who love this series because it is supposed to be an action adventure piece. After the inside jokes and the walk down memory lane, you got to give the younger folks something that is going to keep them stimulated or they will just jump ship for the next big summer thrill ride. After watching Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I was not raving about what I had seen, but I was drawn to go watch the first three INDIANA JONES because they were fresh and exciting.  Like your first love, you never forget the first of a franchise. Unfortunately, I am sad to report that, INDIANA 4 has fallen under the dreaded sequel curse.
0312370849|4.0|I received the book in condition better than I expected. It is a good read.
B0040T7B2W|2.0|It's no use in damning Belle and Sebastian for all-but-abandoning their most twee saccharine stylings of \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" because the past ten years or so for the group have been sparkling. They've found a way to keep their sound, while at the same time, updating it for the more casual listener or fan. Albums such as \\"The Life Pursuit\\" and \\"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\\" scream B&S, but are much more lively, fun and often even a little more interesting than their older fare. Knowing of the lapse since their previous album, I was hoping \\"Write About Love\\" would continue in that trend of catchy goodness they've taken a liking for.    Boy, was I wrong.    This album is a downright boring trip through what could almost pass as a second-rate b-sides compilation from \\"Tigermilk\\" or even \\"The Boy With the Arab Strap.\\" It's a shame because it starts off with the climbing-and-soaring \\"I Didn't See It Coming.\\" After that, it drifts off as quickly as it builds. It's not to say the music is bad, it's just really, really bland music coming from a band that had (as I had assumed) found its way.    Could this be a beginning of a return to the old days? ..before the departure of Isobel Campbell and the reinvention of their sound? I certainly hope not. Stuart Murdoch seems to be a subtle visionary, a brilliant one, too, but \\"Write About Love\\" doesn't support that at all. It's a grand step back in time and I don't think that's what B&S should really be doing at this point in their existence.
B003L77TZI|5.0|My name is Taylor, I'm a boy, I'm 14, and I am using my dad's account.  Enjoy my Katy Perry Teenage Dream review...    This is an incredible album!  Every single song has its own taste and Katy Perry has an amazing voice!  These are my reviews for each song...    1... Teenage Dream- 5 stars... This song makes a perfect start to the album.  It starts out pretty and relaxing but then goes into this great dance sound.  The lyrics are very love-like and the song is addictive    2... Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)- 5 stars... This is a very catchy, 80's like type of song.  Katy's vocals are amazing and the chorus is fun and catchy!  It's a great song to dance to!    3... California Gurls (feat. Snoop Dogg)- 5 stars... This is the most catchy song on the whole record!  The lyrics are hilarious and the song itself is full of fun, cotton candy yumminess!    4... Firework- 5 stars... This song is amazing!  Katy gives a great performance in this song!  The chorus is my favorite part!  Listen to this and you'll see how special it is!    5... Peacock- 5 stars... Well... this song is definitely not for little kids!  It is very catchy but it's a little risque but Katy is not trying to shock people, I think she is just writing how she honestly feels about a guy.  It's fun and catchy but if you let 5 year olds listen to it, don't tell them what the song is really all about!    6... Circle The Drain- 5 stars... This song is great because it is catchy and is about a relationship that wasn't so great.  Katy's boyfriend was obviously taking lots of pills in this song.  But she did a great job and I love it!    7... The One That Got Away- 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!... THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ENTIRE RECORD!!!  It is beautiful, honest, and sad.  Katy's vocals in the chorus make you want to burst into tears.  Katy and other singers like Avril Lavigne, never fail to write sad, pretty songs!!!  Listen to this and you'll looove it!    8... E.T.- 5 stars- This is the most hilarious song on the record!  It's about falling in love with an alien!  It's kind of weird but in a good way!  It's really catchy when Katy says \\"Kiss me, k-k-kiss me.\\"  It's a fun song and anybody would find it amusing!    9... Who Am I Living For?- 5 stars... This song is really interesting... it's catchy but I don't think I have a full understanding on what it's about.  My guess is that she's thinking to herself about what her life is like and who she is living for.  It's a great song and it's catchy so listen to it and like it!    10... Pearl- 5 stars... This is a really classical, pearl-ruby like song that makes you feel good, and it is about how Katy has grown up.  She went from a shell to a pearl, as she says in the song.    11... Hummingbird Heartbeat- 5 stars... This is an incredible love song and it is amazing!  When anybody is falling in love for the first time, you should listen to this song... because it's worth it!    12... Not Like The Movies- 5 stars... This is a very drop-dead gorgeous, piano ballad about Katy Perry's love.  I assume it's about Russel but then again, I could be wrong.  Listen to it and you will enjoy it!  Just like Katy says in the song, this song has a \\"fairytale feeling.\\"
0307454541|4.0|Typically I'm not a huge fan of crime/suspense type novels, so I was hesitant to pick up this book. But friend after friend continued to pester me with recommendations, and I finally folded and bought the damn thing. I was surprised to find that I couldn't put it down! I read it in just a few evenings and even found myself thinking about it throughout the day, looking forward to getting home so I could curl up with it and find out what happened next. Usually I figure out the twist in books early on, but I truly didn't see this one coming. I loved the scenes that took place in Blomkvist's temporary home on Hedeby Island; it was so cozy and now I want to go there! A really, really captivating mystery that I didn't want to put down.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|HEREAFTER deserves a very mixed review because it deals only superficially with the supernatural and offers no real answers despite the fact that its craftsmanship is undeniable.<br /><br />After a brilliant start with the tsunami wreaking havoc as giant waves sweep over an entire village beach front, I expected HEREAFTER was about to delve into and explore the possibilities of an afterlife.<br /><br />Instead, we examine the lives of three separate individuals whose lives are about to converge rather unconvincingly at the finale. Meantime, we have no idea where the story is going until the final scene. There's an uneven quality to the thread of the story with many scenes played too long before getting near the payoff.<br /><br />But overall, the acting is excellent, particularly that of the little boys, FRANKIE and GEORGE McLAREN, who play the twin brothers effectively, CECILE DeFRANCE, the French woman who almost drowns during the tsunami and her lover (THIERRY NEUVIC), who makes the deepest impression as far as acting and charisma goes. MATT DAMON is effective as the psychic who wants nothing more to do with his \\"gift.\\" But at all times, the script gives nothing more than a surface treatment of the hereafter and avoids delving into a deeper look at the supernatural implied by the film's title.<br /><br />HEREAFTER could have been a great film. As it is, it's uneven, slowly paced, and avoids the paranormal aspects that its title implies will be touched, especially since its main character is a psychic. But on the credit side, the opening sequence is amazing for its special effects. Unfortunately, what follows is not as absorbing, challenging or thought-provoking as it ought to be.<br /><br />The cooking class scenes between BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD and MATT DAMON were dragged out and less than satisfying, due to her irritating habit of delivering giggles with each line to suggest the airiness of her character. Furthermore, their relationship is never fully explored once he agrees to do a psychic reading. She just disappears from the plot line after foolishly begging Damon to practice his skill. The script might have taken a better turn if it resolved their relationship in a meaningful way for the conclusion. Likewise, there are other scenes that are totally irrelevant and give the story a lack of focus.<br /><br />An attempt to end the story of our three main characters on a bright note is only so-so in effect. I'd have preferred a deeper look at the supernatural than this hints at being and the ending just seemed downbeat and contrived.<br /><br />The acting throughout is uniformly fine and special praise is due MATT DAMON, THIERRY NEUVIC and the McLAREN brothers, all giving top-rated performances. Clint Eastwood's direction is fine but the script presented too many obstacles for any director to overcome.just disappears from the plot line after foolishly begging Damon to practice his skill.

B003Y58CKS|5.0|It is difficult to imagine that the Virgin release of Verdi's Rigoletto will be bettered in the near future. Musically, vocally and dramatically this is one of the most satisfying performances of this opera that I have heard and seen. There is not a whiff of routine or cliche. Maestro Luisi conducts on the brisk side but never at the expense of the music or the singer; indeed those arching Verdian melodies are always given full value. And it must be added that the three leads give more than full value. There isn't an Italian among them but their unerring sense of style and how the music should go compensate for a performance that could have emanated from the stage of La Scala. Among the information that Amazon provides is the \\"timing\\" of the set:90 minutes! This couldn't be more inaccurate. If one checks the timings for most of the sets, the opera runs about 128 minutes. A major exception is the Met set which is alleged to run 180 minutes! I heard and saw this set some years ago, but it is clearly off the mark. I have the ROH set and the timing is listed at 170 minutes. I relistened to it and it checks in at around 128 minutes. There are extras which may boost the timing to 170 but this figure clearly is off the mark as far as the opera is concerned.    As far as Juan diego Florez is concerned, this set is significant. After the run he announced that he was dropping the role! A pity as he is ideal, but the man knows his voice better than we do; thus we must respect his decision and be thankful that it at least has been memorialized. His decision is interesting in that one of his predecessors counted the Duke as one of his signature roles. Tito Schipa has left records documenting his mastery of the role; I assume that he sang it at the old Met--a very large house, larger than any in Europe. Schipa did nothave a large voice: old 78's document this as well as his repertoire. If I am wrong, I trust that corrections will follow. At any rate conductors did respect vocal size in those days. Remember too, that de Luca was considered a great Rigoletto and he was not blessed with an immense voice, a Warren size voice. Florez is marvelous, elegant, musical and charmiing in his depravity. All the duke's arias are rendered with a bel canto sensitivity which surely is what Verdi intended. Damrau matches her Duke with equal musicality and sensitivity. I can only repeat myself by sayiing that her two great arias are exquisitely molded with legato and beauty. As coloraturas go she has a larger voice than, say Galli-Curci, but no less sensitivity to line. Zeljko Lucic (sorry no diacriticals) may not be Italian and the tone may not be as \\"sappy\\" as Warren's (or another greatly underrated American baritone, Robert Weede). But it is a performance to be reckoned with: dramatically and musically satisfyiing, involved and committed. I have to make mention of the Sparafucile: Georg Zeppenfeld. A young man blessed with a black sound that is reminiscent of Gottlob Frick--high praise. Is there a Haen, a Hunding in his future? One can hope.    As to the production I suspect I will have to hedge a bit. Lenhoff is responsible for a somewhat goofy reimagining of Lohengrin, an updating of Dialogue of the Carmelites from Hamburg, a wonderful Tristan from Glyndebourne and a Parsifal that is a mixture of the outre and the wonderful. In the two Wagner opera there are bonus lectures provided which are pedantic in the extreme. One can hardly absorb half of what he is saying. Poulenc and Verdi are spared his academic pontificating. He has updated Poulenc to the (presumably) Nazi era. this has had little or no effect on the opera; after all the henchmen of the French revolution were thugs of the same stripe as the SS. Rigoletto in its time did, of course, have political ramifications and Verdi was obligated to make changes in the source material. As near as I can determine Lenhoff has not offered any political parallel. The Duke's court is dissolute as is the Duke, the courtiers support this amorality: in other words the essentials of Rigoletto are followed in a way that most of us are used to. That the costumes are (more or less) contemporary is really not important and no one wanting a first class Rigoletto should let this be a barrier to acquiring this set.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|I couldn't get past the first five minutes before I shut it off.  Being a mother, it was completely horrific to me to see a real baby being used to act out this part.  Who lets their child be laid on a pile of fish guts naked and screaming for a movie??  The real kicker for me was when the children tried to suffocate the baby.  I'm sorry, no.  I don't want to see that in any movie - that truly is a nightmare for me!  My mommy instincts kicked in and all I wanted to do was protect the baby, and it completely turned me off to anything else that might have been interesting or thought-provoking in the movie.

0374290024|5.0|Ian Morris combines the best aspects of Jared Diamond, Paul Kennedy, David Landes, and Thomas Friedman while contributing his own fascinating insights as an archaeologist in this insightful and fascinating book.  Why The West Rules-For Now is  solid world history, beginning with the first hominid developments and stretching to the early twenty first century CE.  The primary question Morris asks throughout deals with which area, West or East, had the advantage and was more highly developed during each historical period.<br /><br />But Why The West Rules is more than just history.  Morris roams freely throughout the time periods, using economic data and statistical analysis to extrapolate alternative scenarios leading to very different outcomes.  These counterfactuals are always fascinating, none more so than the one with which Morris begins his book, describing an abject Queen Victoria humbly performing the kowtow before a triumphant Chinese overlord.<br /><br />Even more fascinating and important are the final chapters, in which Morris speculates on future developments and posits several possible scenarios for the next hundred years.  These are also solidly grounded and are convincingly argued. They make Why The West Rules-For Now a book one hopes national and cultural leaders will read and discuss  for many years to come.

0307346617|5.0|I'm only three-fourths of the way through the book, so I'll keep my review brief. First of all, I'm a huge zombie-fiction fan. I've seen more zombie films than I care to recount, read all of Kirkman's \\"The Walking Dead\\" and done my best to prepare for the time when the real thing happens (that last bit was a joke, I'm only partially convinced it will happen).   I find myself more and more surprised reading the book how incredibly vivid both Max Brooks' vision and writing both are. I felt (most specifically in the battle of Yonkers) that I was right in the middle of things, and the pace, tension and fear just never let up.    The most important aspect in my opinion though, is Brooks' genius use of zombies as a means of attacking the tendency of those in charge to take freedoms with the lives of those they govern, in order to secure the \\"greater good\\". Freedoms like forced sacrifice, deciding who is \\"worth\\" keeping alive, decimation of soldier batallions as a means of keeping control, etc. As with all great zombie fiction, this author has realized that during a zombie apocolypse, the zombies pale in comparison to the evil and pain that we can cause each other.   In case you haven't realized yet, I love this book, and find it to be one of the most interesting, layered, original and terrifying tales I've read since Orwell's '1984'.

B00005JLRT|1.0|Just an all-around boring snooze of a movie.  Probably worse if you are a Star Trek fan, because you know it could have been so much better.  This movie was actually much worse than the average television show.  I have no idea how the script was approved for filming, because it's all right there in the basic story - boring, and more boring. I guess the main drawback of the film is that it just seemed worn out, as if the story had been told one time too many.      For a wonderful, spot-on review of the film, go to the Roger Ebert website and search for this film, it's an amusing and deadly accurate review on what went wrong with the Star Trek line of films.  Thank goodness J.J. Abrams has come along to rejuvenate a dying patient.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Very good read.  A friend recently suggested that I read this book and I was shocked at how good a read it was.  I half expected to be reading it as a piece of comedic fiction, but found myself agreeing with the majority of the questions Von Daniken poses.  While I don't believe in the theory, I love the idea that he challenges traditional thinking and provides options that are outside the norms.  If you have an open mind, give this a read.  You won't regret it!

0307389839|4.0|As a distance runner, it's great to have sources to draw upon for inspiration. Haruki Murakami's memoir (of sorts) gives an interesting look at what he thinks about his writing. But if you're not interested in that, it really is about one man's life as a runner, what motivates him, both to run and write, and what meaning he finds out on the trail. If you're looking for inspiration as a runner, I recommend this one. Maybe not to get pumped up for a big event, but rather to find peace, satisfaction, and meaning in the work you pound out on the road.
B001VNB54A|1.0|In a word:  Disappointing.  I was a big fan of BoB, but do not subscribe to HBO so I waited until the DVD set came out to watch the series.  I couldn't even get to the end.  By the 5th episode I had given up on the series, which seemed to have dedicated inordinate amounts of time swapping back and forth between the drudgery of training to the indiscretions of Marines on leave (all of which you can see elsewhere with better detail).  Further, the almost perpetual state of physical and mental decay amongst the Marines was unrealistic and even absurd at times.  Oh, and where was the Navy in this series?    The series became disinteresting very early, the characters were not likable and the plot devolved into something out of a daytime soap.  Nothing about this series was memorable, with the exception of the memories of the money I won't get back after having bought it.    Save your time and money.  Skip this.
0439023521|5.0|I know a book is good when I put off all other responsibilities, including sleep, in order to finish it. And even though this is classified as a 'young adult' novel, I enjoyed it perhaps even more than other 'adult' novels I've read recently. It deals with a very mature concept without being too graphic, and at times is very thought provoking.     If you have read Koushun Takami's \\"Battle Royale\\"  then the idea behind \\"The Hunger Games\\" will be familiar. In an effort to keep their citizens in a state of constant fear and passivism, the Capitol of Panem (formerally the USA, renamed after a violent uprising of citizens against the government)has created the \\"Hunger Games\\", an annual contest to the death between 24 kids between the ages of 12 and 18. One boy and one girl are randomly picked from each of the Capitol's outlying 12 districts. When the story begins, it is reaping day, when the 'tributes', as they are called, are chosen.At age 16, Katniss Everdeen has already had to endure four reapings in District 12, and she has had the fortune of never being picked. But this is the first year her younger sister Prim has been required to enter, and wouldn't you know that she is picked and Katniss volunteers to take her place. To make matters worse, the male tribute of District 12 is a boy she owes her very life to--Peeta Mellark, the son of a baker who purposly risked a beating from his mother in order to give Katniss bread when she was on the verge of starvation several years earlier.    Just in the first few chapters Suzanne Collins has set the pace for an exciting, violent and emotional story that never loosens its grip on the reader. Katniss is caught in a whirlwind of activity where she must prepare to kill or be killed, but the complications of having Peeta involved make the situation much more difficult, as there can only be one winner of the Hunger Games.   Katniss is an easy character to like and root for, even when she is being completely oblivious to certain situations right in front of her. Her main goal is survival, and she will do whatever it takes to win. The deaths are handled very tastefully and are never too graphic. The romance is also subdued, no more than kissing, but adds just the right amount of extra suspense and problems for Katniss to deal with.   You can't read this book and not help to wonder if something like this could ever happen in the civilized world. Could one government become so powerful that the could keep an entire population controlled to point that no one thinks twice about children being sent off to kill one another? How long would people allow it to go one before rising up against the government and taking control again? By the end of \\"the Hunger Games\\" it is clear that another revolution is brewing, and Katniss is right in the middle of it. Almost as soon as I finished this book I rushed out to pick up \\"Catching Fire\\". Collins has created a mature read for anyone, though some parents might want to read it for themselves first before deciding if it is appropraite for their kids. If anything, it should encourage some family discussion about the boundaries of power and how one maintains individualism in the face of overwhelming subjection. I can't wait to see how Katniss's story ends.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is one of those games that keeps you coming back for more. The game changes every time you play, so you need to invoke new strategies to win for every game. 3 or 4 people can play, but it's the most fun to play with 5 or 6 (you can buy an extension that allows you to play with more people). After playing only 2 games of Catan, I realized I needed to buy the extemsion because this game is just that fun. And now it's even MORE fun! 20 games later, I'm still fully enjoying it! Players must achieve victory by collecting 10 Victory Points. Victory Points are acquired by building settlements and cities, and by collection Victory Point Cards. Players collect various resources throughout the game which they can use to build roads and settlements etc. The beauty of this game is the fact that a 10 year old can enjoy it just as much as a 50 year old. The 10 year old will build whatever he can to try to achieve victory, the 50 year old will try to base his game play on strategy. And believe me, there is so much strategy involved in Catan. Trading is an important aspect of the game. Players trade resources with each other so they can build more on the board. A fun twist me and my friends add to trading is this: Any deal is fair. Where some people would only trade resources, we trade ANYTHING. This means we could agree to not build on a certain spot on the game board if the person gives us the resource we want. It also means that we could pay someone $1 for one of there resources if we so choose. This special rule really adds a lot to the game because trading is important. Catan is an AMAZING game, I'd recommend it to anyone! It's my favorite board game I've ever played, and I love board games.
0525951652|2.0|Both my wife and I were underwhelmed with Follett's latest. The characters strain the reader's credulity - other reviewers have already remarked on the Welsh miners' kids who routinely outsmart army officers, lords, businessmen and powerful politicians, and the German soldier/diplomat who doesn't give a rip about his relative's homosexuality. The prose is simple and feels \\"mailed in,\\" the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic, and the historical context seems a mile wide and an inch deep - if you want richly-drawn characters living and shaping the 20th century's greatest moments, read Wouk (Winds of War, War and Remembrance); if you want painfully sharp and vivid descriptions of infantry combat, read Myrer (Once an Eagle). The book itself feels padded - I suspect the exact same book could have been put into well under 700 pages. The whole thing feels less like a literary endeavor than the result of a marketing-department brainstorming session.

Not only is she irresistibly attractive and adorable, she's funny, smart, dedicated, and truly talented at her job, which not too many people on the planet could pull off. So why on Earth a television network would let her go is beyond her comprehension and ours. Nevertheless, she's fired from her job as executive producer, due to budget cuts. Rachel McAdams gives one of, if not thee best performance of her career as Becky, in Morning Glory.<br /><br />Now that she's been let go she is desperately seeking employment elsewhere only to find dead end after dead end. Finally, she catches a break when she's hired on as executive producer for a morning show in the slumps.<br /><br />She has her work cut out for her to say the least. The show is a disaster. The lead anchor is a chauvinistic creep, the network can offer only pathetic jokes for stories, and virtually no one really has a desire to be there, nor do they take their job seriously.<br /><br />The person that displays this best is Colleen Peck, played by the lovely Diane Keaton. A veteran of the morning show, she wakes up every day no doubt asking herself why she is still there. Along with everyone else, Colleen cannot really see any potential in Becky, offhand.<br /><br />It's evident the news cast needs immediate revamping to get their ratings up, if they are to stay on the air. Enter: Harrison Ford. Ford plays Mike Pomeroy, a television legend who has long since hung up his hat as a news reporter. His solid plans of lackadaisically waiting out the time left on his contract are interrupted when Becky is struck with the notion that Pomeroy could be precisely what the show needs.<br /><br />Becky forces him out of his fantasy world and back into reality, where he must lower himself to the likes of a morning news caster. As he showed in his previous film Extraordinary Measures, when it comes to playing a bitter recluse, Ford has the act down. Together they will try to do all they can do to save this sinking show and that's where the laughs come in.<br /><br />Morning Glory scored big laughs with the packed audience I shared the experience with; especially when Becky has to `up the ante' so to speak, by orchestrating some hilariously drastic interviews and broadcasts that include a feeble man screaming his brains out on a roller coaster, with a camera mounted two inches from his head. Cut to Harrison Ford's face as he watches open mouthed, out of sheer morbid curiosity - and  we are laughing our heads off.<br /><br />Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna knows comedy and she knows romance and she knows how to balance the two perfectly in an artistic melody. She's shown this before in 27 Dresses, The Laws of Attraction and Three to Tango. Morning Glory isn't a rom-com by any means, but it has a little romance nestled in there for good measure. Patrick Wilson has a small part as the office hunk and he is charming and likeable without bogging the story or the comedy down with heavy romance.<br /><br />Director Roger Michell who's brought us such gems as Changing Lanes and Notting Hill, has delivered another one. He lets great actors do great acting and he brings us to a world that I found fascinating and that I haven't seen too much of in movies, which is: what it takes to produce a live television broadcast. Not sure it's a venture I'd sprint to the head of the line to work in personally; but I certainly enjoyed watching humorous and believable movie-people at each other's throats in it for nearly two hours.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|** Minor spoilers ahead **<br /><br />A daring bank heist: four armed robbers in heavy disguises hit a bank in urban Boston, executing every detail with clockwork precision - but despite their precautions, one of the employees manages to trigger a silent alarm, and the cops interrupt them.  Taking one of the managers (Rebecca Hall) as hostage, they flee the scene and manage a getaway without being apparently identified, but paranoid about what the bank manager may have figured out they decide to watch over her.  The leader of the group, Doug (Ben Affleck) takes on the task, and eventually meets her, gets to know her, and...well, you might be able to guess where it's going, as this helps to cause complications with the rest of the group, especially his childhood friend (Jeremy Renner) and as Doug starts to question how much longer he wants to maintain his life of crime.<br /><br />Ben Affleck's second film as director is a solid genre piece, with good-to-excellent performances for the most part, but there's no question that it's in some ways too beholden to typical crime genre tropes, and rather predictable.  We have Doug, the kid from the old neighborhood (Charlestown, an old neighborhood of Boston that used to be an independent city) who unthinkingly follows a life of crime (bank and armored car robberies) until he realizes there might be a reason to stop; we've got his best buddy (Renner) who keeps guilting him into staying at it, and who is more than a borderline psycho; and the incredibly cold-blooded mob leader who runs the whole operation and won't let anybody leave it (Pete Postlethwaite); the tough FBI agent who has to be almost as dirty as the criminals (Jon Hamm); the victim-girlfriend who doesn't know about the life of crime (Rebecca Hall) and who represents a better life - being educated and not from the projects and all; the scorned, sleazy ex-girlfriend (Blake Lively), and a plot that mostly goes from a to b to c.<br /><br />But Affleck has a decent visual sense, a really good eye for the neighborhood details, and a solid way of putting together an action sequence - the robberies and car chases are exciting and punchy without relying too much on the typical shaky-cam that to my mind has ruined a lot of action cinema over the past decade.  And he's got an excellent touch with his actors, particularly the women - I would be astonished and disappointed if the British Hall, disappearing completely into an American character, doesn't get some awards attention, despite some thinness in the writing of her character.  I'm not sure that I'm crazy about Affleck's own performance, but his character more than most is hurt by the generic qualities of the script, and the relationship with Hall never comes off as terribly believable from either character's POV.  And there's an attempt I think that grows over the course of the running time at making this story out to be something more than an action-thriller (especially in the rather pretentious snippet of closing narration) that doesn't entirely work - the film can't decide ultimately between being a drama and an action film and isn't capable of handling both smoothly at the same time.  I think we'd have to be more sympathetic to Affleck's character to really get the whole \\"tragedy of a life in the projects\\" sense that is building; but I for one can't really see a guy who is still willing to fire automatic weapons at cops, with bystanders in close proximity, even after he's claimed that he's going to change his life, as anything like a hero.<br /><br />Still, despite some fairly significant problems in the screenplay and characterizations, this adds up to a very entertaining piece of work, and Affleck's sense of Boston and the urban terrain is exciting and very solidly real.  I hope he continues to make pictures in the city where he grew up; New York and L.A. get enough visibility in films.  Those who haven't seen a zillion other films of this type and who respond a little bitbetter to the central romantic/dramatic arc of the story will probably love this film, and I'll certainly be catching up with GONE BABY GONE, Affleck's first film as director, and with Rebecca Hall's earlier performances.ramatic arc of the story will probably love this film, and I'll certainly be catching up with GONE BABY GONE, Affleck's first film as director, and with Rebecca Hall's earlier performances.

1439156816|5.0|I have never read anything by Stephen King since I don't read his genre.  However, when this book was suggested as a valuable reference at a writer's seminar, I decided to pick it up.  What a delight! The ideas I had in my head about this author went right out the window.  The first third, which is a C.V., I found very refreshing.  Here is a man who is willing to tell the whole world about his successes and failures, his achievements and his weaknesses.  I found him humble and truthful, not talking down to the reader but putting himself on my level.  I got the feeling that he still has to pinch himself sometimes to realize his great success as a a popular fiction writer. I was very taken with his dedication as a family man.<br /><br />The second part is Toolbox which reveals his recommended tools of writing. Vocabular should be the first tool and do not make a conscious effort to improve it. Attempting to dress up your vocabulary will not produce a good product - he recommends to use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.  Next is grammar which includes the basic parts of speech. Nouns, the words that name,  and verbs, the words that act, are the indispensable parts of writing.  In this section he describes his dislikes which include adverbs, the use of the passive voice and dialogue attribution.  These three rules are so golden that I have started back through my own writing to make sure these errors have not crept in.  The third layer in the toolbox is elements of style and King refers frequently to the Bible on this subject, The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. King puts forth the idea that the paragraph is the basic unit of writing. The quicken in the pace of a story comes at the paragraph level.<br /><br />The third part is On Writing. He groups writers into a pyramid, at the bottom the bad ones, next the competent writers, good writers and great writers.  He gives examples of each type and talks about the weaknesses of himself and others writers.  He says that good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals and then making a good writer out of a competent writer by hard work, dedication and timely help.  He claims it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad one.  The talent to write comes as a natural born creativity that can be honed.  Great writers are not made, they are born great. In order to be a writer, one must read a lot and write a lot.  I agree.  King recommends to write what you like and then make it unique with your own personal knowledge of life. I think that is one of the reasons why he says a writer must read a lot.  It helps to build the necessary knowledge.  King admits his style of writing is to create a situation and let the characters deal with it rather than have a set plot or story to begin with.  It works for him, maybe not for others.  Descriptions should include only what is necessary to  make the reader a sensory participant.  Dialogue must be true.  Well-crafted dialogue tells a lot about the character and can be used to reveal facts. Once a story is on paper the writer must think about what it means and enrich the following drafts with that conclusion.<br /><br />He suggests writing a whole first draft with the office door closed,  distractions kept to a minimum and no outside critique.  Write as fast a you can exactly as things come to your mind. Then let the whole thing set for a period of time, weeks. Then  reread the whole thing over making notes, fixing misspellings, picking up inconsistencies, looking for glaring holes in plot or character.  Finally, open the door of the office and let other trusted friends and colleagues see it.  The Ideal Reader will help you gauge whether the story is paced right and if the back story is satisfactory.  Back story is the stuff that happened before the story began. It helps define character and establish motivation. A second draft should be 10% shorter than the original. King also talks about writing courses and seminars, the benefit of these being that the desire to writer is taken seriously. He ends this section with a brief description of how a writer may proceed to get published.  Be your own advocate, do not forget magazines as a first publishing venue, and you should be able to get an agent if your work is salable or has promise.<br /><br />The last section of the book, On Living: A Postscript, describes his nearly fatal auto-pedestrian accident that stopped this book in its writing.  I was very saddened by the suffering caused by his serious injuries, but he went back to work only a month later.  This description helped me understand that life has very serious interruptions and to continue to write after a horrible experience can help a person recover and heal.  Life will bring us all trials and as writers, our love of writing is a solid rock to cling to along with our faith, our family and our friends.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any fledgling writer for the view it gives of the heart of a writer and his ideas of what works.

0312600844|4.0|I never got around to reading Corrections, so I can't evaluate how well Jonathan Franzen's new work, Freedom, matches up with that extremely popular book. Overall, however, I really enjoyed Freedom. In short, this book follows a trio of characters over the course of several decades. The story centers on Patti and Walter Berglund, a married couple who at the beginning of the book are living in suburban Minneapolis. The second section of the book is told from Patti's point of view, although as several readers have critically pointed out, this section is still told in the third person and doesn't read much differently than the rest of the book. In this section, Patti discusses her childhood and college years, including how she met Walter. She also introduces a new character, Walter's roommate Richard, a musician in a local punk band. At the very beginning of this section, which was written some time after the events in the first part took place, Patti implies that her marriage with Walter ran into difficulties, and it is immediately clear that Richard played a central role in that. Therefore much of this section deals with the complicated interactions and relations between these three characters, all leading up to the very crucial moment implied at the beginning.     The action then shifts ahead several years, when the Berglunds, still together at this point, have moved to D.C. and their children are both in college. We get to know their son, Joey, in greater detail, particularly the troubled relationship he has with his parents, as well as the complicated relationship he has with his long-time girlfriend from Minnesota. Walter is now an environmental activist working to protect bird habitat, and his new female assistant, along with another appearance by Richard, further complicate Walter and Patti's marriage, leading to a dramatic conclusion.    I noticed that several of the more critical reviews of the book complained about the characters, specifically that they weren't very likeable. I can see where these critics are coming from, but I think it's too harsh of an evaluation. The characters are certainly complicated and imperfect, but as the book progresses, Franzen does a nice job of fleshing their characters out, providing some context for their actions, so that they become more empathetic. I would say that I found the character of Connie, Joey's girlfriend, rather perplexing and unbelievable. There are some implications that she suffers from depression and mental illness, but these implications are never really resolved satisfactorily.    I probably wouldn't read the entire book a second time, which is why I gave it four stars and not five. While large sections of the book flow very smoothly, and Franzen's prose is excellent throughout, some parts, particularly those dealing with Walter's political activism, were a bit more difficult to slog through. That said, it was still a worthwhile read, and I would with pleasure go back and read certain sections multiple times. I was incredibly moved by certain passages, particularly those dealing with how the characters dealt with great personal loss and tragedy. And, without giving away the plot, I found the conclusion to be very touching and satisfying.
B003ZK58WM|2.0|Mr.Follett has done better.  While the  ambition of the project should be acknowledged, I hope the upcoming installments connect the characters with the events in a less contrived way.
0061353248|5.0|Love the book and how it exposes the awkwardness that financial transaction add to our lives.
0060763280|5.0|I thought this book was very informative. It has some excesises in it that I thought sounded really odd. Like tap your head while saying \\"I have a millionaire mind\\" But I have done it and somehow it is changing my mind. This book really explained to me why and what was keeping on poverty. Now all I need to do is follow the books advice. Like not spending money on worthless stuff. Also the book has a website where you can download some affirmations. And on the website you can fill out an affirmation where you declare when you will become a millionaire and they will send that to your e-mail. It looks like a certificate that can be framed. If you have a poverty set mind this book may be for you.
B001G8XON0|3.0|Moulin Rouge is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I've watched the hell out of the DVD, and vowed to pick up the title as soon as it hit Blu-Ray.  Well, I did just that, and have been seriously disappointed by the release.  The video claims to have been remastered and \\"Approved by Baz Lurman\\", but half of this disc seems to have been mastered out of focus.  The contrast is muddier, the colors aren't quite as vibrant as they should be, there is quite a bit of noise in many of the dark/slow-motion shots.  Half the time, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor feel blurry and out of focus, even though the surrounding scenery might be sharp.  Did Baz approve this transfer by checking it on an iPod?   I've also seen this film in the theater several times and I don't remember the film prints having this many issues.    Unless you are a huuuuge fan, do yourself a favor and stick with the special edition DVD of this movie.
0440131480|5.0|I love this book. Others have said a lot more, but I simply think everyone should read this book. There, now go read it!
184767481X|5.0|After watching the youtube videos this author posted, I had to get the book.  Its all sketches without words.  Some single frame and some series drawings.  Its a laugh, if you like the simons cat videos or know someone who does, they will like this book.
B002NUULNG|2.0|When I was younger - I tried many times to finish this movie. With the release of 2.0 - I somehow finished watching it. The new features aren't worth the purchase due to the lack of quality that was inputted into this version. Nothing new besides the terrible CQ sequences that belong in a Playstation 1 game. Which - if I remember correctly - were two. SKIP.
B00005RIKI|5.0|I'm just getting into Lynyrd Skynyrd, and I'm starting to love their first album, (Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd). I know I should have listened to this sooner, but still, I'm glad I found this album. Every song on this debut album is a scrumptious feast for my ears. \\"Free Bird,\\" pretty much my top favorite song on this album, is flawless. \\"Tuesday's Gone,\\" \\"Simple Man,\\" and \\"Things Goin' On\\" are just plain brilliant. \\"Mississippi Kid\\" and \\"Poison Kid\\" are fun to listen to. The rest of the songs are great, although \\"I Ain't The One\\" is pretty bland in my opinion.<br /><br />(Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd) is a classic, and it should remain a classic. And even though I'm not a big fan of Southern Rock in general, I might change my mind later on in the future.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8/10
B0040QYROA|5.0|I just watched this last night on TCM. It is the most complete version, adding forever lost (until now) footage, which tells the story with much more clarity.<br />One of the complaints with the 2003 release was that the newly recorded music score was complete but didn't cue up properly with the still incomplete film.<br />This film's score works marvelously! It is, again, newly recorded in 5.1 surround sound and matches perfectly with the film's action. In that regard, if it weren't a silent film, the audio track on the added 16mm restored footage would probably sound horrible. Because the film's sound exists only of the wonderfully recorded score, the really grainly film scenes suffer no audio compromise.<br /><br />The newly discovered and restored scenes are, indeed, very grainy and noticable. By stark contrast, the scenes which are very clean are beautiful, especially for a film from 1927. Juxtoposing both are certainly noticable, but given the importance of this film and the opportunity to flesh this story out as completely as possible is a concession worth making. Perhaps technology will exist in the next 15 years which will allow the 100th Anniversary release in 2027 to produce a very even film - probably holographic 3D to boot!<br />A wonderful film and the best version you're going to see.
B003EYVXYG|2.0|First, I consider Romero to be THE authority when it comes to the zombie genre. Everyone since his first zombie movie has patterned their style of zombies after his. So I sadly have to say that this movie was a disappointment. The character development is poor, the acting is subpar and hammy, there is no chemistry between the actors, and the script is reminiscent of a poorly written 70s film. I bought this DVD because I am a fan of zombie movies and I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Romero movie. I'm still hopeful that Romero will continue making \\"...of the dead\\" movies and will remain a fan despite this movie but hopefully the next installment will be better.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This movie was great when it released. The DVD version - the Collector's set - and now the Blu-Ray version. The Blu-Ray version is a must buy for any FFVII fan - or anyone into action movies or high quality CG movies. With it's extended version on the blu-ray - watching this version of the movie again was like watching it for the first time. All the extras and bonus features are a plus too. Highly recommend purchasing this Blu-Ray.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|SPVTW is incredible for a zillion reasons, but for one, it manages to finally put on American screens a sense of humor that has been enjoyed by American teens for decades in the pages of Anime and Manga.    The more into that scene  you are, the more the nonsense of the film will make perfect sense, but it's all packaged in a north american veneer that makes the film enjoyable to all modern kids from 13-30.    People who don't enjoy this film tend to be people who can't accept films that move outside the standard flow of American films.
B003UYUQZW|3.0|I really liked the locations and the behind the scenes info on how this film was made. Good story. Good character development. However, I thought the movie ran a little long and lost some momentum.  Nice tension between the two lead characters but to no real conclusion.  It would have been nice to see them fulfill thier ongoing attraction.

B001Y8WAKA|5.0|July 9th, 1983.  At fourteen, I was seeing my first concert at the Long Beach Arena: Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Fastway.  I remember when the lights went out just before Saxon came on.  The place went freakin' nuts.  It was as if Maiden wasn't playing at all.  Saxon ripped into the \\"Power and the Glory\\" and my ears melted.  Not only was I hooked on live music, but I went out the next day and bought this on cassette.  (By the way, Iron Maiden was pretty good that night too!) Over the years, I wore that tape out and eventually purchased it on vinyl.  I've followed Saxon's carrer on and off over the years, but this record is definitely a desert island top 10 for me.  It has to be played at FULL VOLUME to appreciate it.  If you only buy one Saxon album, THIS IS IT!!

B003VIWO9I|3.0|Classic Terry Pratchett, yes, if you like the other Tiffany Aching books you'll like this one.  However, as with Pratchett's other books there are amusing footnotes which Kindle mangles and places at the back of the entire book.  If, like me, you love the wonderful asides these footnotes offer, buy the phyical book and get somethign else on the Kindle.
061891868X|4.0|I found Smolin's book quite interesting and in some sense novel in the subject (at least at the time it was written). As a member of physics academia, I found myself nodding in agreement to most of what is written in the last sections of the book regarding the 'sociology' of science and what should be the goal for physics in the coming decades. I also feel that some re-thinking is needed on the current curriculum for physics majors all over the world.  His list of problems that should be attacked by physics is also adequate and reflects current theoretical research. Also, his assessment that String Theory has, at this point, failed to solve a few of them seems well supported by the material included in the book.  The main reason why I did not give a 5-star rating is that the book is a bit too dense in terms of information and that at some points it is actually difficult to follow. As a scientist, I found some of the explanations too superficial. Also, I found inconsistent that the same author that claims the readers should doubt groundless statements by scientists...is happy to often add new concepts with some fancy label and just tell us that since they are too technical we must just believe them. Finally, although I appreciate that a lot of the resources have been placed into the String Theory camp, I am unconvinced that is the only reason why quantum gravity has also failed to deliver...maybe BOTH approaches are flawed?
B00406UK7S|4.0|Year: 117 A.D.<br />Combatants: Romans VS Picts<br />Rating: R (language and blood/gore)<br /><br />This is not your typical 'Roman Era' type of film. The normal Roman type battle consists of massive armies and extensive battle scenes. However due to a severe betrayal of trust, the entire Ninth legion is whittled down to just 6 men, plus Quintus Dias (Fassbender), the sole survivor of a previous Pictish raid on a Roman frontier fort.<br /><br />The fighting scenes in this film are Intense, with a capital 'I'. The brutality and viciousness of the battle scenes are well captured. There is a lot of body, limb and head chops that can make your blood crawl.<br /><br />These seven soldiers (on foot) are now in a race against a brutal set of horse mounted Picts to get out from deep behind enemy lines. To make the situation even worse is the brutal cold and the ruggedness of the terrain, which is beautifully captured.<br /><br />The tension is kept at a high as the unexpected arrows fly with deadly accuracy, as well as surprise ambushments.<br /><br />This film is well worth the watch, and is gripping right unto the very end.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|The Dock Stubz converter works just as it said it would.  It allows my iPhone 4 to dock to any device without the necessity to remove my OtterBox Defender series case.  It was a little difficult finding this handy little device, but I'm glad I did.  I could not find a docking station radio labeled iPhone 4 compatible that would work with the case on.  I even considered giving up my defender series case and using the very thin silicone cases that are popular and still, the iPhone 4 would not fit in any of the radio docking devices, it was just too wide to get a proper connection.  The Dock Stubz eliminated that problem right out of the box.
B002FID3M2|5.0|What a deliciously wonderful book! (For those who haven't seen the movie with Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, I recommend that too.) The author spins a sensuous and romantic story about a Robert Kincaid, a wandering magazine photographer and Francesca Johnson, an Iowa housewife born in Italy. The author provides two characters who approach each other with respect and caution, yet they both strive to fulfill their need to soar above the mundane, to celebrate life, and culpt a moment in time that transends commitment and soul smothering societal expectations. Their encounter, frought with dangers, survives only in their psyches. Both know that what could have been, should have been, could not be. Yet, hearts persist, tickling both characters' minds. Both remember a few stolen moments when two souls sang in perfect harmony, but through circumstance must not sing again.    For authors there is much to learn about building sexual tension, character development, and involving the reader through the use of all senses.    Hats off to the Robert James Waller who with his delicate phrases tweaked my heartstrings on each page.    Review by: David S. Rosenberg, author--The Hungry Dragon
0312427999|5.0|The free market economic revolution is exposed in accurate and substantiated detail for the horror story it is. Far from being a scientific theory, it is exposed for what it really is, a cultish set of beliefs, based on an assumption that human greed is the fundamental motivation of humans, and the way to create a better world is through unleashing and encouraging and if necessary forcing governments in emerging democracies to subject their populations to the violence and degradation of its consequences. In country after country we are shown precisely how such economic manoeuvreing behind the scenes has resulted in the replacement of democratic governments by dictatorships, of the rule of law by the rule of terror, of cultural diversity by the monoculture of poverty. What the west labels terrorism fades into insignificance in the light of the structural violence manifested by their own economic policies. We are shown clearly the results of implementing policies devoid of compassion whose consequences are devoid of the 'freedom' they promise. Except, that is, for a ten or hundred fold increase in millionaires. For many years Americans have been puzzled about why the world seemed to hate them. If they read this book they will have their answer.
0312600844|1.0|I read `The Corrections'first and liked it even though some parts were bizzare/ unbelievable.  At least I felt sympathy for the characters in the book.  After having struggled for 300 plus pages of `Freedom', I finally decided to quit my efforts to finish the book.  This is the first time I have ever abandoned a book half way through.  I will not read another Franzen book no matter what the NY Times, Time Magazine, etc, etc. may say.  He was on the cover of the Time Magazine because of `Freedom' ?????  The fact that this book is not among the finalists for the 2010 National Book Award for fiction says something.  Many seemed dismay by the omission. For me it was assuring to know that I was not the only one who had hated this book.    Do not waste your money buying this book.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|It takes someone of Aaron Sorkin's talent to diss a litigious billionaire on screen; it also takes his skill to make a legal-commercial spat interesting (admittedly there are billions at stake here, but compare this with Wall Street 2).  So overall I liked the style of the movie; Zuckerberg is played (extremely well) as almost closed down, Asperbers type personality.   The areas which cannot be proved - did he plant stories, call the Police to party's he did attend - are suggested in the movie, by lawyers acting for him i.e. they are suggested as reasons why he should settle with his former business partners out of court, rather than get smeared with allegations.    The movie takes place (mainly) in Harvard, where Zuckerberg is a computing genius, who lacks certain social skills.  He is part of a group of programmers, and comes up with various programs which (to say the least) are very easy to use (and popular); the roots of Facebook lie here.   He cooperates with (and then leaves) the Winkelvoss twins, who want to form an exclusive online club, based on having Harvard email addresses (or so the movie says).  They eventually sue him for stealing their ideas.   He forms a company that becomes  Facebook, with some of this other friends and eventually outgrows them and moves to California where he is guided by the founder of Napster to dilute the shareholding of his Harvard friends. The Napster guy eventually resigns from Facebook due to being caught at a party where there were drugs present etc.    I ended up sympathetic to Zuckerberg.  He seems quite emotionally immature, but hugely talented; and has sufficient megalomania to see his vision through (think Henry Ford, Bill Gates).  He clearly doesn't want to take advertisements during the start up phase, until Facebook reaches a vast audience, and has the drive to uproot himself to California.   He has the ruthlessness to get rid of his initial shareholders (not illegally, but effectively) and keep growing.   You maynot like to socialize with him, but business success means you pursue a vision without compromise.   One thing I did directly after the movie was to Google `How does Facebook make money'; apparently it makes about $500 million per annum from various types of advertising and product sales.   Its not exactly ESSO's revenue, but it seems to have that kind of valuation.  Maybe its a bubble.   Insofar as I have a concern about Facebook , its what happens when/if it goes public, and if earnings disappoint what will the company do with the information they have collected?  However I don't loose sleep over it.  I presume there will be a generation whose teenage embarrassments will be online, however if it happens to everyone it will become acceptable.   A bigger concern for me is the distortion that is evidenced by the movie.  It is obviously based around the experience of one of Zuckerberg's Harvard friends, while being sanitized (presumably) to be legally defensible.  Sorkin's talent has been used to make this view accessible (and possibly seen as definitive) by the movie going public.   I'm more worried about the distortion of truth by talented scriptwriters than I am about the commercialisation of privacy by Zuckerberg.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|I agree with all of the positive notices.  I've seen this film multiple times, both in theatres on on DVD, and it pulls me in every time.  What a terrific ending!!!    A friend sent me a two-page collection of \\"gaffes\\" detected in the film by various nitpickers---virtually all of them trivially minuscule errors, such as the ferry rate from Martha's Vineyard to the mainland being way too low.  This kind of \\"gotcha\\"  game can be kind of mindlessly diverting for fans of the film, but none of the cited errors make a bit of difference in one's enjoyment of the film.    One thing I noticed myself: the film takes place in January, mostly on Martha's Vineyard, during mostly miserably rainy weather. Yet every time the beleaguered ex-Prime Minister emerges from his hideaway there are big crowds of protestors jeering and heckling him.  The off-season population on the Vineyard is very sparse, especially so in January, and it defies belief that there could be this many people living on the island who are sufficiently infuriated by Adam Lang's alleged war crimes to camp out outside his citadel in such crappy weather.  And certainly they are not taking the ferry over every day!    Doesn't matter.  It's not a documentary, and I saw the film quite a few times before this even occurred to me.  I didn't even recognize Jim Belushi as the ghost writer's publisher (he has a shaven head here) until my sister pointed it out.    The ghost writer is never given a name.  I wonder if this is Polanski's slight nod to Hitchcock's \\"Rebecca\\".  In that film, the title character dies before the film action begins.  She's the worshiped first wife of Lawrence Olivier's character.  His second wife is continually made to feel that she is an inferior replacement.  To underline her anonymity, Hitchcock did not give the second wife a name.  In Polanski's film, the ghost writer replaces another writer, who has drowned in suspicious circumstances.  That first man is frequently spoken of in glowing terms, which unnerves his replacement.  You notice that although the title character is in several scenes in which he is meeting new people, nobody ever asks him his name, nor does he ever volunteer it.  The ex-prime minister calls him \\"Man\\", and the PM's wife (who shares many scenes with him, including one in bed) never calls him anything.  It's a credit to the screenwriter's skill that this doesn't jump out at you as an anomaly.    Wonderful film.
0691142165|4.0|\\" We've got to jump\\" says Butch, exchanging fire with a posse who surround them on three sides, the only escape route is a cliff-edge over a ranging torrent. \\"Nope\\" says the taciturn Sundance, grimly aiming and firing.   Butch, perplexed, eventually gets  Sundance to explain that he won't jump because he can't swim.  \\"Are you crazy?\\" yells Butch \\" the fall will probably kill ya....\\"  There's a foreign exchange joke in the book which says that its not the inflows of mobile capital that does for economies, its the sudden stop; this reminded me of the Butch Sundance cliffhanger.  I read the book to try to gain an insight into the causes of the financial disaster.  I didn't get this, but the book does clearly state that foreign exchange crises, banking crises and government defaults are by no means uncommon.  It goes on to compile a data set which allows impacts and timelines of the various types of crises to be averaged out (a recession which follows a banking crisis is possibly the worst kind, by the way; and can lead to sovereign default).  At root, its the uninhibited accumulation of debt, by individuals, companies and countries, which leads to major defaults.  The lack of inhibition is in each case associated with the phrase `this time its different'.  I assumed that defaults hadn't really occurred in `stable/developed' economies since the thirties, however the surprise for me is that the data on default etc. Is so widespread.  How come we weren't more aware of this?  I live in Ireland, where we have had the most severe banking crisis in the developed world so the books analysis  is quite stark.  The first half of the book is quite difficult and technical, however the second half is very clear.  It would have been useful to read it five years ago.

B0000025ZF|5.0|Short and simple - I hadn't listened to this for years until today.  This is an absolute masterpiece. A true concept album - a format that I don't ever find these days.  If you've never heard it, take a listen - by yourself, with no distractions and on the louder side (lots of \\"hidden\\" stuff going on in the background tracks!).  It's like a long emotional road trip....It will bring up emotions you never knew you had.

1401310400|1.0|As an avid reader and a big fan of the TV show I was looking forward to the books written by \\"Richard Castle\\".  What a big disappointment.  I found myself not liking any of the characters (and I so wanted to because I love the characters of the show)and the story line dragged.  Do yourself a favor, stick with the television form of Castle.
0385339585|4.0|The story is very compelling and worth your time.  On the cover of the paperback edition there's a quote by Larry King saying that it's the most gripping first 50 pages he ever read or something like that.  That'a a bit of an exaggeration.  In fact, the book starts a little slow in my view but builds up nicely.  I took a star away only because the ending falls a little flat in my view.  The story builds so nicely that you're expecting a \\"wow\\" moment, but it ends up being a little sappy.  However, Grisham does some tremendous work delving into the character of Nate O'Reily.  Read and enjoy.
1401309666|4.0|What exactly is the long tail?  There are very few products in the world that actually sell very well in a genre, like how the Backstreet Boys sold millions of records back in the late 90's.  The Backstreet Boys would have been part of the \\"Short Head\\", or one of the bands that were responsible for a large amount of music sales during that time. However, what about all those little bands that nobody ever heard of?  Well, since all these bands sold very little music, they are a part of what is called the \\"Long Tail.\\" The long tail used to be something that most stores would never really care about, they would just have the music for the top selling bands and call it a day, but today, that is not the case anymore.     Chris Anderson shows in The Long Tail how consumers today are able to broaden their horizons outside of mainstream products.  Music, movies, TV, radio, you name it.  People now can have it in the blink of an eye.  SO now, all those huge bands do not sell as well as they used too, because people can easily find more diverse music that was never showed to them before.  A lot of this is possible because of the internet.  You can look for any type of band, TV show, radio station or more all around the world, which is something most people were not able to do even 20 years ago.  Amazon.com has over 25% of its profits come from this long tail, because while a band by itself won't sell much, the 10,000 bands that are available will sell enough to make it profitable to carry.  Chris goes into saying that there were three main forces that paved the way for this phenomenon:  Democratized Production (people can now create their own movies at home if they want with a digital camera and post it online), Democratized Distribution (as I already said, Amazon.com), and Connected Supply and Demand (websites like Rhapsody).      Chris Anderson definitely shows how much the world has changed within the past 20 years.  Any person can now be famous as long as they have the talent because of websites like Youtube.com.   The days of the Short Head being in demand are over, and now, everyone will be looking for the niche of their desire.  Now the question is when will the curve become a plane?

B001B51B9M|5.0|The movie is superlative and the Blu-ray is great! So, just some comparisons with other releases.    The Making of...documentary (\\"Right Here in River City\\") on the Blu-ray is carried over from the DVD BUT it is eight minutes shorter. (Blu-ray = 22 mins. vs. DVD/Laser Disc = 30 mins.) That's nearly a third of the documentary missing. I imagine the editing down was due to legal issues: not having the same clearances for photos, etc. for the later BR release. Also, the Blu-ray doc. quality is not as good as the DVD. Some of the stills are quite bad actually (probably working from a dupe transfer, not original elements).    Also missing on BR from the DVD release are several series of Production Notes: still cards of text telling very interesting information about the Cast & Crew and the history of the production. The BR has the same reissue trailer but the DVD also has a trailer for \\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\\" not carried over. So, if you like Bonus Features as do I (I also produce them), keep your DVD copy just for the extras.    As for the film itself on Blu-ray, I used to use the Laser Disc as a sound demo for friends. It's one of the best movie sound recordings of its era. I feel the Blu-ray does not have the bass response of the Laser, nor are the surround speakers as pronounced. It's been suggested that the BR requires a Subwoofer (which I do not have, since my speaker system does quite well without one) to fully hear all the lower end. Conversely, the BR track is crystal clear, bright, crisp and present, so I'll get over it.    I ran it last night for 18 friends and we had one of the best, most joyful times ever. What a masterpiece! During the \\"Lida Rose/Sweet and Low\\" medley, I started to cry out of sheer happiness. Talk about an uplifting, feel good movie! As my friend Paula comments, 'it's one of the best musicals ever because it celebrates the transformative power of music. Everyone's life in the film is made better because of music.'    And the BR is an exceptional presentation. From my experience on limited titles, Warners. does an excellent job on their BR remasters and new transfers (I never thought I'd see A STAR IS BORN look and sound so good). Other reviews have raved about THE MUSIC MAN BR quality, to which I concur (other than my slight disappointment about the bass). I think I'm ready to watch it again!
0140157352|4.0|\\"Getting to YES\\" is a book about how to come to mutually-satisfactory agreements with people, from your spouse and kids to your boss at work or even in a hostage situation. The real-life examples tended to be business-related or based on national-level events, but it was easy to see how each principle could be applied in any situation. It was easy to follow his points and see how to apply them.<br /><br />Quite likely some of their suggestions won't be new to you. Either you did it and didn't know why it worked, you read it in a marriage/relationship book, or learned it from someone. But you'll learn why it works plus new things you hadn't thought of before. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their working relationships (and I'm including spouses in this).<br /><br />The book covered: why merit-based negotiation is better than haggling-style negotiation; how to carry out merit-based negotiation and why it works; how to negotiate successfully with people who are more powerful, refuse to play by the rules, or resort to \\"dirty tricks; and a summary of the main points of the book. The second edition included answers to 10 questions that people repeatedly asked them after reading the first edition.

Thank You Rhonda Byrne for sharing this..........
B000WS4QJG|4.0|This album is really great, one of Michael best ones, but I don't like the new versions added at the end

B003VFEROQ|4.0|I'm a hardcore David Bowie fan, so there was no way I was going to let this one go by... and the charity seems a good one. Full disclosure, though -- I've listened so far to only the first disc and bits of the second. The vast majority of the bands are new to me. My first and most obvious observation is that nobody is ever going to top a Bowie original (ever). But that's fine. (With the exception of Apocalyptica's version, I've detested every cover version of the great \\"Heroes\\" that I've ever heard.) My first disappointment with this collection is that so little of Bowie's output post-Let's Dance is represented. I get tired of the \\"good old days\\" mentality here, and to my mind Outside, Heathen, and (to a lesser extent) Reality are all strong works in the Bowie canon, but aside from \\"I'm Deranged,\\" none are represented here. My main hesitancy about this album is that a lot of the artists here seem to be trying a little too hard to outbowie Bowie. Lots of submerged vocals, electronic overtreatments, bleeps, fizzes, and so on (and I'm an Eno fan, too, with no particular prejudice against these things). But I would have liked to see at least a few of the artists veer from the robotic.     However, I suspect that this is the kind of record that will reward repeated listens. Thus far for me, the cover of \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is the standout. All in all, a worthy enough addition to any Bowie fan's collection, but anyone who is just discovering David Bowie should stick with the original, at least for awhile.
031606792X|5.0|This came in perfect shape and came right on time. I would definitely buy from again.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|People always get down on this movie's utter absurdity. The reason of it's ludicrous nature I take from Lucas' hack writing. HOWEVER, this molten cheddar cheese factor is this movie's greatest strength and curse. This movie is a complete and utter fantasy, that has the hallmarks of an exploitation movie but doesn't venture into it's realm fully. We get Indy hooking up with two idiot stand in characters, and accidentally wander into a satanic cult. Call it whatever you like, it is blatantly obvious the makers had Satanism on the mind when they made up the bogus cult of the Thugees, WHICH IS FREAKING AWESOME.    The annoying parts can be ignored and fast forwarded through. The highlights of the movie are its WAY over-the-top ritual scenes when the Thugees worship Kali and pluck out hearts and such. Without these wacky pseudo-satan cult scenes, this movie would not be as popular as it is.    In short. If you liked the other two Indy movies, and you happened to love movies like The Devil's Rain, you will enjoy this classic clusterf*** of melo-dramatic adventure. This is a genuine adventure movie its purest, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Lost in Austen is a delightful twist on Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Amanda is from current times and is a fan of Jane Austen.  She reads Pride and Prejudice over and over with some teasing from friends.  Through a quirk of fate she is switched to the past and changes places with Elizabeth Bennett.  What fun to watch Amanda as she tries clumsily to adapt to Regency England culture!  Amanda tries to manipulate events for the Bennett family but things don't go as she expects. The plot twists and turns satisfyingly.  I Loved the references to Colin Firth's Pride & Prejudice,too.  As a fan of Austen's, I wasn't keen on watching this but was delightfully surprised.  There is food for thought here...a lot of \\"what ifs\\". You do have to suspend your tight hold on Austen's work and let yourself go in this piece.  If you can, you are in for a treat.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I watch this with my son, and it brings me back to the place of wonder, where things are different, not all is known and you may be small<br />and feel powerless but your strong and can push forward. Fantastic MOVIE for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />100/100 for me.
0500515328|4.0|This book is lavishly illustrated and has much documentation.  However, I feel that there is more information on the individual members of the Romanov family than of the jewels themeselves.  The author should have included who the present owners of these gems are or if they have been distroyed.  I understand that some of the present owners might not like their names included, so the \\"generic\\" term Private Collection would have sufficed.  It is very inconvenient to have to go back to the end of the book to see the source of the photographs and thereby surmise who the present owners might be.  Nonetheless, it is a great book to have for lovers of jewels and the Romanovs.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|Bought this for our son for Christmas-I love that it came with a truck toy.  Good value for the money.
0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show is a classic in my opinion.<br />Jeff Bridges is one of my favourite actors, he is amazing in most of his films and this one included!<br />The story would seem like a simple story, but there is so much going on in this film.<br />A story about an almost forgotten time.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|If you are a dog lover and this movie doesn't have you crying like a baby by the end, you'd better check your pulse. The movie is a little corny and Richard Gere is not my favorite actor, but the story itself is heartbreaking -- and also heartwarming.
B003TVMIDO|4.0|As a big fan of Lennon's, I was eagerly waiting for the remasters to come out. And this pacakge is very well put together. It represents a work of art. I think John would have love how this was packaged. But, the 3 ablum trilolgy, Mind Games, Walls And Bridges, and Rock n Roll were disappointments for me. They do not sound as good as the remaster from earlier in the 2000s. They sound muffled and with no bass. The other albums, do all sound great, including the singles CD and the outtakes CD. I generally take up for Yoko, for I feel she has taken so much crap that was undeserved, and once again the packaging is exquiste, but I do not see how she approved this. Maybe I am a little too picky. One thing I will give her kudos on is the album CDs went back to the oringinal tracking and artwork, no bous tracks. Overall, a job well done, but I will listen to the past remasters on the MG-W&B-RnR CDs.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|...but I just couldn't. The beginning of the series left much to be desired. I wasn't drawn in to it like I was with Eccleston and Tennant. There was nothing in the beginning that left me saying \\"Now THAT'S my doctor!\\" Absolutely nothing.   I tried very hard to enjoy the series. 'The Vampires of Venice' was overkill--why must every show have vampires?--and 'The Time of Angels' left me completely bored with the idea of the weeping angels. Even the series finale left me wanting more.   I'll admit, Matt Smith and Karen Gillian are great actors, but the writing made them worse than they could've been.   I might consider buying this set, but not at this price. Maybe I could manage to part with twenty dollars for it, but no more than that. This is not the Doctor Who that I fell in love with.   But yes, I will continue watching. I still have hope that the writing could get better and the Doctor could seem less... well, mad... before the end of the next series. We'll see.
0061997811|5.0|What a gorgeous book!  I was expecting interviews, some behind-the-scenes photos, maybe closer looks at props, sets, and concept art.  What I got was much, much more.  All the film details are amazing, yes, but this book is about much more than just the films.  It's about the Harry Potter UNIVERSE.  From the Black family tree to (admittedly abreviated) Marauder's Map, every page reveals another little treasure.    While this book is definitely focused on the movies, even those who prefer the books will find plenty to love.
0321200683|5.0|When I first saw this book I thought it looked nice and noted that it was associated with Martin Fowler, but figured that I had plenty of patterns books and didn't need yet another patterns book. I couldn't have been more mistaken. Recently I was reading the early access edition of Spring Integration in Practice from Manning Press and noticed that they kept referring to the Enterprise Integration Patterns book. It turns out that the book breaks new ground to cover messaging patterns in a way that I've not seen in any previous book. \\"Messaging patterns\\" are not simply messaging in the sense of Java Message Service (JMS) (although they may include that). They are patterns that have to do with work flow through an application where the message carries the payload that needs to be worked on, often in multiple steps. The book has plenty of diagrams to explain these patterns and the web site has links to free stencils that can be downloaded for Visio and other applications. While the web site has quite a bit of free content, there's considerably more meat in the book, so don't think that you've seen it all if you've been reading through patterns on the web site.    In short, Enterprise Integration Patterns is an essential book for those working in the enterprise spaces that want to learn from other developers that have come before them and captured a bit of what they've learned. It will certainly help simplify complex designs and contribute to avoiding a host of possible missteps. Definitely worth your money.

B003ES5ZPK|4.0|This is a good quality adapter that does everything it claims.  It is well made, the swivel action is good, the connections seem to be of decent quality and it performs well.  Not sure what else to say, it seems like a good product at a fair price.<br /><br />If you need a swivel type HDMI adapter, this is it.  It will allow you to more easily run your cables without compromising a/v quality in anyway (that I can tell).<br /><br />The picture and description are accurate and represent the item well.  Seems like a good value to me.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|If you are a Pink Floyd fan, you will truly enjoy this double DVD video. The absence of Rick Waters on bass and vocals is regrettable from a nostalgia point of view, but the music and show does not suffer as a result. The Pink Floyd sound quality and light show production are once again, the BEST in the music and entertainment industry. WOW!David Glimour is at the top of his form as well. My only regret is that is is not offered in Blu-Ray. Buy it now.    Gary D.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|The first Final Destination was a preety good,entertaining, and somewhat original film(despite similarities to death scenes in The Omen). The second was also an enjoyable film that in some ways exceeded the first. The third wasn't terrible and was still an okay film but showed  a downfall in the series. This fourth entry in the series is by far the worst. The other three's opening disaster scenes were anywhere from really good to decent, the one in here is just cheesy and lame. It involves a race car crash that leads to a stadium falling apart and crushing many of the people inside. This scene is poorly done with terrible cheaply done cgi special effects. This film also suffers from cheesy 3d gimmicks that might have had some affect if you saw it on the big screen but are otherwise annoying. The death scenes in this one aren't as good or original overall as the ones in previous films. One involving a guy having his innards sucked into a pool drain was kinda cool even though the cgi blood ruined it a little. This film is overall lame, predictable, and a disposable entry in a once good horror franchise. A fifth film is planned and I just hope that it will be better than this one.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I just loved Toy Story 3.  In my opionion it is better than TS2 and because of advances in the technology- better than the original too.

They are great reads, unique, fast paced, and logical.
031603438X|5.0|The long awaited autobiography by legendary Rolling Stone guitarist, Keith Richards, is now in stores and being devoured by fans the world over. Weighing in at 544 very readable, informative, historical pages, I was pleasantly surprised at the lucidity with which \\"Keef\\" tells his story.<br /><br />I know some of you will credit James Fox for making Richards easily comprehendible and that may very well be the case. However, Fox still needed a lot to work with.  That said, my bet is that what you read is Keith \\"thru and thru\\" (Stones fans will get the pun.<br /><br />The book opens with Richards' perspective of the famous 1975 bust in Fordyce, Arkansas, cluing the reader in to the negotiations and shenanigans that took place to get him and Ronnie Wood sprung from jail.  I was particularly interested in this story since Keith alluded to the event when my daughter and I caught the Stones during their tour stop in Little Rock in 2007.<br /><br />The rest of the book is equally as unvarnished in telling known and unknown stories about the Stones.  Stories behind the songs?  Absolutely.  Stories about the women in his life?  Yep.  How `bout Brian Jones' death.  A little bit. Altamont? Not as much as I would have like. What about the legendary drug use?  C'mon!  We're talking about Keef!  Of course he spills the beaker on it all.<br /><br />Also shared, in his own way with words, are war stories from the road, the studio and a myriad of places from around the world.  The gossip-monger that resides in each and every one of us will especially relish the digs and barbs he reserves especially for Mick Jagger.  How much of it is for show or for real, I don't know.  But it does make for some very fascinating reading.<br /><br />What will be of special interest to musicians - especially guitarists - will be the various secrets to much of Richards' guitar playing.  This, along with the stories behind the songs, is where you see the world in which Keith Richards lives and breathes, deservedly giving him the reputation as being a true rock troubadour.<br /><br />I was particularly touched by the incredibly tight relationship between Keith and his son, Marlon, from his relationship with Anita Pallenberg. Because of the incredibly crazy circus that Keith called \\"life\\", Marlon was forced to be an adult well before he should have.  However, from the looks of it, he appears as though he's turned out to be a well grounded adult and family man. Amazing how that happens.<br /><br />The tome closes with a heart touching story of some of the last moments with his mom as she lay dying. To me, the story shows me that Keef isn't as out of it as he likes to come across. He allows the reader a peek into a very special and personal moment in his life without sharing everything. One is left with the feeling that there other things that took place between a mother and her son before she passed away. Keith exhibits real class in knowing what to share and what to keep for his own pondering.<br /><br />The book left me with the impression that Keith wanted to tell everything from his perspective while, at the same time, say some things that he felt needed to be said.  He clearly is seeing that there's less of life's road ahead of him than there is behind him. Perhaps that's why he's obviously no longer as concerned about his rock and roll pirate image as he places more importance on family and relationships.<br /><br />Such is Life.<br />Randy Patterson<br />Boomerocity.com<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006JU6O Keith Richards and the X-Pensive Winos: Live at the Hollywood Palladium, December 15, 1988]][[ASIN:031603438X Life]]being a true rock troubadour.

1439177783|5.0|A brutally honest look into the amazing life of an amazing girl.  I pray this book becomes #1 on the NY Times Bestseller list.  The courage, insight and energy that it must have taken her to write this book renders me pretty much speechless which I guess is probably not good in a review.  Some things I could relate to (ED stuff - particularly using the orange color of the cheetos to \\"mark\\" and certain feelings) and others I could not, but with Portia's gift of writing, you \\"get it\\" as much as you can without being right in her shoes.  Anybody who has ever struggled with an eating disorder or being gay will want to read this book.  Nobody is alone and I thank God for that and that she has a happy ending and new beginning.
0525951652|4.0|I am a ken Follet fan after reading The Pillars of The Earth and World Without End. While starting to read Ken Follet's other spy novel, they are not really my favorite story type. Fall of Giants is in the same category as Pillars and World, so I couldn't wait to start reading it. Pre-ordered mine a few months ago, I got it shipped to my door on the day of release.<br /><br />Ken is a master story teller. From literature perspective, Fall of Giant is a as good as any other Ken Follet's novels. It tells the stories of inter-winding young men and women around the time of World World I. Compared with Pillars and World, the portion of history and real historical figure are weighted more in Fall of Giant. You can almost read it as The-History-of-World-War-I-In-The-Eye-Of-WALTER/MAUD/FITZ/ETH, and so on. So I agree with some of the previous reviews, that it reads more like a history book than stories.<br /><br />There are many threads of the stories. Each of them are interesting and fascinating. Though I also feel that it lacks the main punch. It does not have a main line, such as the love between Jack and Aliena in Pillars. Among the three books, my rank will be 1. World, 2. Pillars and 3. Fall of Giants. Fall of Giants is clearlly not in the same class as World or Pillars. It's a great book, but it is not exceptional as the other two.

It wasn't necessary because I have plaster ceilings with lathe so we just screwed it up. I definitely recommend this solar system.

142311339X|4.0|I buy these books for my nephews, but always read them myself before giving them.  They are based on the Greek Myths of gods and goddesses, presenting them as real, with half blood \\"hero\\" children who are the main characters in the books. The young Heros encounter all manner of magical and mythical creatures.  They fight, sometimes with deadly consequences.  This, of course, makes them somewhat controversial.  I do recommend that concerned parents read and then discuss the books with young readers.    The story-lines are always fast paced but also very well researched and clever.  My nephews adore the Rick Riordan books and even the 9 year old has read every one!  When considering the competition of all manner of electronic gadgets and gizmos, games and internet surfing, any book that can encourage kids to read is a great one!

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Curious Case...\\" for many reasons, which I will detail below.  Unlike the film, I'll try to keep it brief!<br /><br />First, Eric Roth wrote another great screenplay. Or perhaps should I say, he dusted off his fabulous screenplay for \\"Forrest Gump,\\" changed the names (if not some of the places), and voila! Another wonderful, allegorical romp through an imaginary world where personal character is the most important thing. The parallels between the two screenplays are amazing, and it makes for a fun evening to invite your friends over for dinner, then spend a few hours trying to see who can come up with the most parallels (Louisiana, strong mother figures, no/weak father figures, strong african americans, overcoming handicaps, fighting in the war, hummingbirds & feathers, boats, running odd businesses, emotionally vapid lead male character, beautiful ephemeral female lead who returns after travelling the world to have a baby with male lead, etc. etc.).<br /><br />What I love about Eric Roth is how he completely suspends reality in order to get at what is most real (and important), such as character, perseverence, family, and caring for other people.<br /><br />Clearly Brad Pitt was directed to suspend personality in the portrayal of his role. In retrospect I feel better now about how Tom Hanks portrayed Gump, because Hanks was able to suspend being normal, without suspending Gump's feelings.<br /><br />Cate Blanchette was fantastic. She is sooo good. Wow is she talented. Oops, I said I'd keep my comments brief. At times all I could do is stare at her stunning, handsome face, born to convey raw grit, power, and determination with etherial grace. She is one of those women who will never be pretty, but will always be more attractive than all the other women in the room - even those who are thirty years her junior. Like Robin Wright in \\"Gump,\\" she was very worthy of the role, and elevated the visual beauty of the film. But I think in \\"The Curious Case...,\\" Cate also filled the personality gap left by Brad.<br /><br />I was a tad disappointed by a few things. When \\"Benjamin\\" gets.... old ...eh, young, ... I mean, when he comes to the end of his life, why did he shrink back into a baby? Since he came in as a tiny old man, I would have expected him to go out as a huge baby. Oh well, that wouldn't have been as pretty as that beautiful little baby.<br /><br />I could only see two flaws in the screenplay (which is two more than I found in \\"Gump\\"). First, why did \\"Benjamin\\" come into the world with some wisdom and poise, and leave with so little? It should have been the other way around.<br /><br />Second, if the movie is about character, loyalty, and family, why then does \\"Benjamin\\" abandon his family when they need him the most? Instead of being with them, we see scenes of him traveling across the globe, through Tibet (another Pitt movie...), China, etc. on a motor cycle. Yes, I was watching when he told \\"Daisy\\" that he didn't want to be a burden on her or the child. But I didn't buy it. It was totally out of character, and contrary to what I saw as the point of the movie.<br /><br />Oh well. Add it all up, and it was still a great way to spend nearly three hours. Much better than the other alternatives being offered in my local sixteen screen mega-movie house.<br /><br />I hope Eric Roth keeps writing. But I hope its about something entirely different next time.the personality gap left by Brad.     I was a tad disappointed by a few things. When \\"Benjamin\\" gets.... old ...eh, young, ...

0132350882|3.0|It is definitely a must read book. It gives tons of useful advise and gives you a ton of things to think about.    However, some advice is usable only at the toy-system development level. E.g. there is a strong implication that logging an error message is the only thing that would ever be required on \\"unhappy\\" code paths.    Another example is the requirement for function sizes to be limited down to 3-10 lines. Sure it will work for a project that draws a magic band on the screen, but it is clearly unacceptable for projects above 10 mln. LOCs and will be problematic even at 1 mln. LOCs.

0156027321|3.0|Reading 'The Life of Pi' I was less and less sure what this story is meant to be - an adventure story? A dream? A philosphical/theological parabel? Until the episode on the strange floating island, I would have stretched my imagination and believed, that this might be an original and innovative story about the fate of a shipwrecked boy and his slow and intelligent adjustment to the circumstances. But the floating island with all its horrors was simply stretching it too far and cast basically a shadow of dreamy surrealism on the whole story. I finished the book thinking it to be drowning under the overly heavy burden of meaning. I do not feel enticed to read another one of Martel's books.
0553805371|3.0|Stephen Hawking, considered one of the most brilliant minds of modern times, has always fascinated me with his insights, his humor, and his intelligence. He does not approach the \\"there is no God\\" argument--and believe me, that's what this book centers around--with the sense of bitterness found in Dawkins' or Hitchens' books. He maintains that objectivity that is so important to scientific endeavor, while so hard to truly embrace in human terms.<br /><br />\\"The Grand Design\\" sets out with large ambitions: to explain the hows and whys of creation. Yes, creation. Hawkins accepts that this reality was created from nothing, that it came about due to an inordinate amount of coincidences and variables, that in fact there is ample evidence that something intelligent was behind such a miraculous and mysterious occurrence. But, as the book then points out, M-theory can explain all of this without the need for a god or intelligent being. In Hawking's own words, \\"No one seems to know what the 'M' stands for, but it may be 'master,' 'miracle,' or 'mystery.'\\" This theory, he claims, can coalesce all the other theories and unify our understanding of the multiple universes. \\"Their creation does not require the intervention of some supernatural being or god. Rather, these multiple universes arise naturally from physical law.\\" He concludes his argument at the end of the book in much the same, saying, \\"Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing . . . Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something from nothing . . . It is not necessary to invoke God.\\"<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed much of the scientific explanation in this book. Hawking has always had a gift for breaking it down in understandable ways. He is brilliant, no doubt. But he makes leaps of logic that, from a scientific viewpoint, can only be seen as failing to remain objective. He says that time itself has no starting point--which, in fact, is consistent with a biblical view of eternity in both directions--but uses that idea to say emphatically there is no need for a specific point of creation. He says the universe is so large, expanding so far, that it negates any validity to the idea of something special or unique about our planet--aside, of course, from the fact we were the one that produced carbon life forms in this particular version of reality. This is akin to saying God couldn't have created this planet because what is out there is so much bigger, therefore He is too small. If He's God, doesn't that argument turn in on itself, finding that He is even bigger than ever imagined, not limited by our versions of reality and/or space-time? Yes, humans and theologians have come at this from limited viewpoints through history, spouting arguments that were laughable, but scientists have also given us theories that worked in their day and age, considered irrefutable, but later were seen as faulty. We learn as we go.<br /><br />As a race we are limited, but we have been gifted with minds and curiosity. Hawking employs those gifts with great skill, but in his effort to undermine one particular viewpoint--a God-centered one--he undermines his own theories. For example, he accepts that intelligent design is a very real possibility, but then explains that away through the appearance of physical laws. Where, though, did these physical laws originate? What set them into motion? And, yes, while I agree time is relative, looping, warping, twisting, we do not get any definitive answer from M-theory regarding where space originated. I do believe a big bang started all of this 13 billion years ago. In the biblical account, the earth was formless and void before the creation of mankind, and that could have been so for billions of years. But the big bang, the moment (in my perspective) when God spoke this into existence, required a provision of space in which this creative explosion could take place.<br /><br />And so we arrive back at the same question. No matter how Hawking tries to dance around it and explore its many beautiful questions, we don't know how something came from nothing. We have no explanation for the God-like abilities that Hawking assigns to gravity and physical laws. Is it really so illogical to believe God established those laws? Hawking offers some thought-provoking concepts, and I enjoyed reading the book, but he decides that he and his colleagues, fellow scientists, are the new lords of creation and that philosophy is dead. In fact, he has not answered the questions of meaning and purpose, of love and charity, or evil or morality. He's simply expanded scientific knowledge, for which I'm grateful, but than called it something it is not.<br /><br />As a believer in a creator, I do accept, just as Hawking does, that something came from nothing (ex nihilo), that it shows all the signs of intelligent design and patterns, and that it is truly beyond mathematical comprehension to have sustained life. Instead of calling that gravity and physical laws, I call that God and His laws at work.<br /><br />Is it possible that M-theory is just that, Master, Miracle, and Mystery? These are three names given to God in Scripture. Could this be an example of the three-in-one? My reasons may vary slightly from Hawking's, but I, too, am in wonder of \\"the grand design.\\"ries to dance around it and explore its many beautiful questions, we don't know how something came from nothing.

0307389839|4.0|Our son gave me the book, knowing that I am a runner, but not knowing that I would move a little later to Cambridge/MA one of the loctions of Murakami's Marathon-training and narrative. I was a bit hesitant in reading the book, because some of the reviews have not been particularly kind. Reading it, however, I was able to relate very closely to Murakami's experiences and impressions. I smiled at his impressions of running along Boston's Charles River, seeing the young varsity athletes passing at a fast clip - I experience the same. I share his sentiments on aging (I am two years younger than Murakami) and its effect on running and I enjoyed his more meditative thoughts on running and the meaning of life.     I still wonder, however, about the meaning of the book for somebody who is not an aging runner or a fan of Murakami's. I haven't read any of his other books yet and I do not feel a particular urge or need after reading this one.
B000BNX4MC|3.0|If you're planning a sick-day, and want a movie to watch, then this is the one. Sure it's a bit 'stuck in the '80s', but the themes are all still relevant, and it's straight up funny. You can probably only watch this movie once a year before it comes across as too corny, but if you know what you're expecting wen you put it in the player, then it's great.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Classic angst-ridden teens in the heat of the 90's - amazing cast, great themes...this show (and Jordan Catalano) will never die for me! Love this box set, it's a must-have for anyone who grew up watching this.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I bought the DVD after falling in love with Rent on stage in Sydney. The songs, the characters, the story - it's such a great production. The movie lived up to my expectations, but it didn't live up to the thetre performance. I recently saw the show again in Dublin, and again, it was great. When I return to Sydney I'm looking forward to watching the movie, cos while it's not as good as stage versions tend to be, I can watch it when I want, and in my loungeroom ... and for a fraction of the cost of a live show.
B001L1S1SK|4.0|Item came fast. Even though I was not happy to see a broken case, the seller was prompt to answer my concerns and return my money. At the end I was pleased to see his prompt responses and before I decided to keep the item he has already returned my money.  Good seller.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It had all the elements of a great action/adventure flick without the ones I don't want to see.  Hope they make more and continue the story.  I live outside the US, where you cannot buy first run DVD's, Thank You Amazon for providing this service.
1401309666|4.0|The Long Tail starts by introducing an article that was published in Wired Magazine (where Chris Anderson is the editor-in-chief) about a pair of books that got popular in the late 80's.  These two books are very similar in nature and competed for sales against each other. Amazon.com actually used their \\"recommendations\\" tactic to suggest the books to readers of the other books. These readers responded well to the recommendations and started to like one book over the other, which caused the sales of that book to surpass the other. The ability of the online retailer to provide real-time recommendations allowed the books to compete at the level they did. People are given the opportunity to learn about an item that may never have stood out to them if they were going to the local bookstore to buy a particular book. Companies such as Amazon.com have helped many products grow at a pace that was not possible 20-30 years ago.      Chris Anderson talks about the nature of popular products (hits) and less popular products (the Tail). He talks about how the \\"long tail\\" products in the past no longer serve the same purpose. In the book he shows how the consumers today are no longer only worried about the product of \\"now\\", rather they are interested in various products.    He wrote this book in 2006, before the social epidemic attacked the world. He shows readers various examples about how the internet has already changed the business models for many companies, and now four years later, almost every company has a business model revolved around the internet and social media. Though 2006 was not too long ago, the world has changed so much in the past four years and I feel Chris Anderson had a good handle on how the world was changing and will continue to change.    I thought this book was a good read, not extremely simple, yet not over the top either. At first glance, you see the charts and you wonder what kind of book it is, but the graphical depictions were interesting and forme personally, pictures stand out. Reading this book has made think about the economy and the market and how it is changing so quickly. The Long Tail is a good read for all, but specifically managers of companies that have not yet embraced the world of the internet, because it will definitely change their outlook.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I am going to give this movie 5-stars anyway...   First of all, I would like to say I loved the original Karate Kid Movies. They are classics. This movie fell short of my expectations. I thought it would have been closer to the original. I wished they hadn't given this movie that title. It would have made the movie more enjoyable to watch. No comparison to the original. This movie could have been more realistic to say the lease....    However, Jaden Smith shined in this movie. He is growing up to be a fine young-man. I laughed alot at his character. His sense of humor in this movie reminded me of his father \\" Will Smith\\". Acting is in his genes. Both parents are great actors.     In all fairness, the first Karate Kid Movies was great to all of us who were kids back then. So, let's not be overly judgemental of this movie, I am sure the new generation kids will love this movie \\" my kids did\\".
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great game, and good for hours of enjoyment. What's included is 13 dice, an instruction sheet, and the tube they all come in.  Rules are simple. roll three dice, set ones that come up as brains to one side, shotgun blasts to another. If any come up as runners, you can choose to re-roll them along with however many needed from the cup to roll a total of three dice. You can choose to end your turn after any roll and add any brains you rolled to your score. If you get 3 shotgun blasts, your turn is over and you lose how ever many brains you have rolled that turn. When someone reaches 13 brains, play continues until the end of the round, at which point the person with the most brains wins.    Each die is one of three colors, Green, Yellow, or Red, which rate the difficulty, or, your chances of successfully rolling brains. Green dice have 3 brains, 2 runners, and 1 shotgun. Yellow dice have 2 brains, 2 runners, and 2 shotguns. While red dice have 1 brain, 2 runners, and 3 shotguns.    Though the game is rated as for 10 years and up, my 6 year old learned the basics in a matter of minutes, and got the hang of the strategy involved after several play throughs,  and is now one of his favorite games. Though there really isn't much education wise, this game can teach him about the possibility of losing everything on a bad gamble. When you live in Las Vegas, this can be an important lesson.    Durability is medium. 13 6 sided dice and a cardboard tube and a plastic lid. Dice can get lost easy if you aren't careful, and the tube, while it seems pretty strong, could possibly get crushed or damaged by a spilled drink.

031603438X|5.0|This is a deeply personal, deeply felt book that relates many of the events of Keith Richards' life while also hinting that there is a lot more, enough to fill multiple volumes.  The reason I took this away from it is because certain instances will be tossed off in a few sentences that feel like monumental.  A comment will be written about a conflict with Jagger or a car crash or the creation of a a song and we're given just enough to get the flavor of it without Richards revealing all the mysteries.  Also, the book is almost impossible to put down even if you don't know that much about the Rolling Stones.  A lot of reviewers have referred to it as \\"unapologetic\\" and I agree.  You read some drug-filled celebrity memories that feel as if they were penned in an AA meeting (Artie Lange's, Nikki Sixx's, etc.) where the person in question is all about making apologies and amends and convincing the reader that though they did them for years, drugs aren't really cool.  Richards just tells the story and makes no judgments about his readers.  It's the story, unvarnished.    One of the more telling parts of the book comes in how Richards talks about the other members of the Rolling Stones.  You walk away with the idea that Charlie Watts is a consummate professional who might have been just as happy in life if he hadn't been a Rolling Stone.  That Mick Jagger is an epic narcissist, but is the only reason the band didn't self-destruct along with Keith in the seventies as Richards just descended into the crapper.  That Bill Wyman just kid his own thing and that Ron Wood was a huge drug user.  That Bobby Keys and Ian Stewart have far more to do with what people like about the Stones than either Wyman or Wood.  That Brian Jones just couldn't handle the fame.    Because the book is so articulate and not the kind of self-aggrandizing book \\"Stone Alone\\" by Wyman is, you feel like you can take more of it at face value.  Richards loves the blues and wanted to be in a band that played that kind of music, composed some truly great songs hand in hand with Mick Jagger, got into drugs for years and came out of it eventually to see that the band was now the Mick Jagger Project and spent a few years trying to get back on top before recognizing that his relationship with Jagger was permanently fractured.  Fascinating, very human read.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|A great film of the Disney Franchise with new characters who are sure to become some of the most memorable Disney characters.
1439163146|1.0|I found little to like in this collection of short stories. Each seemed to be packed with scenarios designed to produce shock and emotion, with very little substance to back it up. The characters were shallow and poorly developed, as were the stories. Instead, form was replaced with the vulgarity I have come to expect from those from the entertainment capital of the world, Hollywood. Cat poop soup mixed with urine just isn't my idea of literature, and neither is a vivid, raw description of an adolescent boy's emissions. Please. This book found its way to the trash can quickly, and seems quite at home there.
0679882820|5.0|I love reading this book with my 2 year old.  She makes all the sounds while I read the rest of the words.  Like all Dr. Seuss, I think this will start her reading off strong.
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|I don't understand why Amazon doesn't have a better price for the season pass. You can get a season pass on itunes for $16 dollars but here all it says is \\"Save 5% per episode\\" so I don't really even know the full price but it seems it would come out to be much more. I love buying my digital content from Amazon over itunes but I just don't understand the pricing.
0920668372|5.0|My 3 year old loves this book.  Makes me cry almost every time.  Heart warming and a great reminder to your kids that your love is forever.  Glad we have this one in our collection!
0316067938|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn.  I didnt think it would measure up to Eclipse but for me it surpassed it.  I can understand why some didnt like the imprinting of Jacob on Nesse but after the shock, it didnt bother me...especially with her growing so fast.  I loved the ending and wish there was another book or two after it cuz I'm going through withdrawals.
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is an odd character. Coolly cerebral, yet a known brawler. Able to out-class the upper crust, yet friendly with the urchins of London. Emotionless, yet unable to control tedium except through drugs. Bloodless, but clearly holding deep affections for Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Irene Adler. Updating stories from the Holmes canon, the writers and producers of \\"Sherlock\\" have captured the spirit of the original, added modern filming and editing techniques, thrown in a nice bit of modern technology, and created an entertaining reboot that is really quite superb.     Each 90-minute case is well-done, and bears repeat viewing. Dialog is spoken crisply, not much is lingered over, so you'd better be able to keep up. The third episode is particular fast-paced.     The actors are excellent choices, the scripts are tight, the direction is peerless, and the genre is well-served.     The game is afoot once more!
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Believe it or not, I had never seen the original Terminator film from start to finish.  So, when I found it offered on Amazon at a good price, I decided to buy it.    Even judged by today's standards, when CGI and over the top special effects are run of the mill stuff, this 1984 film holds up very well.  The \\"hunter/killers\\" that fly over LA by night, shooting lasers at anything that moves are very well done for the time, as are the Terminators.  The piercing, red robot eye that Arnold's Terminator reveals behind his human flesh exterior is haunting, revolting and amazing, all at the same time.  The final confrontation scene, when the Terminator has been reduced to his naked, mechanical skeleton, is also extremely well done for the time, and again, those Satanic red eyes add to the suspense and uneasiness that the viewing audience feels as they watch this machine relentlessly pursue Sarah Connor.    The programmed determination of the Terminator becomes evident very quickly, and Reese's description of it to Sarah brings chills to one's spine, as he describes how the Terminator will never stop hunting her down, never stop trying to kill her as long as either she or he are still alive and operating.  How could anyone ever go to sleep again after finding that out?    Of course, the chase scenes are still some of the best that I've ever seen, and they move the pace of the film along at breathtaking speeds.  And, the famous \\"I'll be back\\" line that leads to an incredible police station shootout is as great as ever.    The Blu Ray transfer of this film is good, but it will not stun you with 1080p, super high def HDMI pictures.  I did not find anything to quibble about with the video quality, though, and for a transfer of a 1984 film, I was entirely pleased and was in no way distracted by any obvious video shortcomings.  Likewise, I was pleased with the sound mix on my 7.1 surround system, with much of the music and effects tracks coming through the surround speakers, while dialog mainly existed in the front and center channels.  Don't expect any big booms or earthshaking, sudden explosions from your sub, as they aren't there.  In my experience, the sub just added the overall bass and low key effects that were needed to fill in the rest of the tracks and make them realistic.  Overall, it was a very satisfying experience both video and audio wise.    This is the first film in a great action series, and I highly recommend it.  It'll be a classic, for sure.
039472903X|4.0|I found this book to be interesting and pertinent even though it was written in the 50s and 60s. If you want a glimpse of the ad world then-it is well worth the read. I recently rented the television series Mad Men and wanted to get a little more information about Madison Ave. during that time in advertising. The book confirms the heavy drinking that went along with creativity. David Ogilvy was a true pioneer and master in early advertising.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie very much.  You have to watch it multiple times to catch all the twists and turns this movie takes and to understand what the British actors are saying, but the plot and story are very exciting and fun to watch.  The emotions they show are so strong you feel you are there experiencing their pain.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Did not view the DVD but received it in a short period of time which was great because I was sending it as a gift.

1416589473|4.0|Hands down one of the best video game-based books I've ever read. The story, the characters, the setting, everything blended well into a cohesive and, more importantly, believable journey. While I saw one of the twists coming towards the end of the book, I wasn't quite sure which character it was going to be, and that is definitely what kept me reading until the very last page.<br /><br />NCsoft could have easily put out crap with the 'Guild Wars' name but they didn't. They hired a fine writer, fleshed out a great beginning story, and I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|After years of looking for this movie, I was eager to get it in the mail. It was delivered within the time frame it was promised. Thank you so much.
1400079144|1.0|i liked angels and demons, da vinci code and especially deception point by dan brown.  this book however was very disappointing and thinking back now i'm not sure why i even finished it - probably like a deer-in-the-headlight stare.  it feels like the story was made from leftovers of the other books, the writing was not good (for example, i don't have to be reminded that someones body was tatooed from head to toe almost every time there is mentioning of that person), it was very predictable and the story didn't have a flow.  just my two cents.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you're a fan of the comic, then you'll love this TV series.  If your unfamilar with the comic, then I strongly suggest picking it up.  I've been following the comic series since issue #1, and I have to say, with only 2 episodes of the Made for TV series, it's absolutely brilliant.  It follows the comics pretty close, but not exactly, which makes it all the more fun to watch.  The characters and casting (so far) have been perfect.  Kirkman is a brilliant writer, and takes the ZOMBIE genre to places it has not gone before.  The key here is characters, and in \\"Walking Dead\\" there are plenty to love and hate.    If your a fan of zombie movies, then you'd be a fool, or undead, to not be watching this series.
B001ADW4UU|4.0|Several others have already said it...Pierce Brosnan...stick to acting!  He's pretty nice eye candy but he can't sing.  This is NOT just 'he can't sing'...more like it should be a criminal offense to let him use his vocal cords for singing.  The rest of the vocals are very well done, many bordering on fantastic.  If you haven't seen the movie, you should take the time to watch it just for Christine Baranski's performance on the beach.  The woman is a hoot!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The was a very enjoyable video of nature. I would recommend this series to anyone that love nature.
B002ZG9788|1.0|Mythology or hyperbole?! More of the latter and very little of the first! This mess is really pushing it. The special effects were indeed \\"special\\" and effects but...yuck! Loved the eyeless hairy covered skulls with them coveting a large super-intelligent talking eyeball on the end of a clump of vines that they were tossing around. OH...and if you like your heros galumping about with hairy legs and a mini-skirt...this is your movie. What a waste!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Simple, true, real. A wonderful, thought provoking book. Even for people who have not loved a dog.
1442337966|5.0|The Power is an excellent read (in my case I listened to it) but none the less it is a great book.  On the audio version each chapter starts with a quote and music to prepare you for the topic.  After the auther reads the chapter so beautifully a summary of the chapter is repeated by a man with a very nice voice.  You can't help but get the message and have it change your life.  A great follow up to The Secret although you don't have to read The Secret to get the incrediable message from this book.
B0047O2HJC|3.0|First let me state I'm a huge Dylan fan, but not necessarily a nerd when it comes to all the technical differences between mono versus stereo.  After purchasing the Beatles in Mono last year and being blown away at how different they sounded, I figured Bob would be similar.  I was disappointed and hate admitting that with these versions I can't hear a big difference -- slight yes -- but different enough to make this pricey set worth it?  Sadly, no.<br /><br />Once again, from a big fan that has purchased all the Bootleg sets, has owned Bob on vinyl and cd and still buys his new cds, I thought this would be a no brainer.  So I thought at least the packaging would be cool.  I have to admit that a well-packaged set will make me keep it much longer than a poorly one.  So how does this one rate for me?  Once again I was surprised to be \\"not blown away!\\".  The booklet has some great photos but \\"way too small\\" type.  In my forties if I have to put on glasses to read type, I usually don't bother.  After an hour and a nice headache I managed to read about the set with mixed feelings about the essays included.  Next came the reproduction sleeves of the original LPs.  On the surface, \\"Cool!\\" but basically everything you would want to read is so microscopic it's pointless.  How about a booklet including Bob's rambling essays in some sort of readable type?  How about and \\"LP sized\\" booklet reproducing these images and type and forget about replica sleeves?<br /><br />Who exactly is this set for?  20-somethings?  40-somethings? Baby-Boomers? Being in the middle of those last 2 categories, most of us can't read small type, so why bother with this limiting packaging?  For $125???? No bonus tracks (except for one if you download the whole set to your computer), no extra discs, no unreleased concerts from the time, no bonus DVD.  $125, really!  WOW!  Is it double-dipping (not particularly), but is it necessary?<br /><br />So to sum up:  The songs: 5 stars (of course); The Mono Treatment: 3 stars (for my ears); Packaging: 0 stars.  Of course, evertyhing being relative, if you've got the cash and you're a huge fan you might need to own this regardless of it's faults.  If you are on a budget, I recommended (instead) THE WITMARK DEMOS 1962-1964 - amazing stuff (most of which you probably don't own any version of, but at least these are \\"unique\\" versions).

B00275EHJG|1.0|My family and I were very disappointed that the very first time we went to view this movie an entire chapter had to be skipped b/c there is something wrong with the DVD. There are no visible scratches but none the less we are unable to watch the entire movie:(
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|The footage in this blu-ray is GREAT. Some parts are extremely impressive in 3D. It's the best 3D content that I've viewed so far. However, the environmentalist message gets old before it even starts. The commentary was disappointing and an utter pain to listen to. I don't know why they couldn't have produced a film that just displays the beauty of the Grand Canyon and its surroundings without having to inject a \\"beat you over the head\\" environmentalist message into it. People don't spend money on a 3D setup and a 3D blu-ray to sit though the blu-ray and listen about the supposed bleakness of the Colorado River's future.     The scenery makes it worth sitting through though. In fact, you could just turn on some fitting music and mute the blu-ray's audio, which would do away with the sickening commentary altogether. Overall, I recommend buying this just to view the incredible 3D footage.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar already has Hollywood dumbfounded by its unbroken track record of solid box office hits. Now Toy Story 3 has surged ahead of its sister films and become the leader. It has also done what even Coppola couldn't do: make a third sequel that arguably tops the first two films.<br /><br />Much has already been said and written about Toy Story 3. While the majority of opinions have been positive, it has also been called the \\"darkest\\" of the Toy Story movies. Some have also expressed displeasure at the cruelty of the Lotso character. [Spoiler alert] One might wonder if there were some behind the scenes debates; there had to been some concern that the fluffy pink bear's misbehavior might have affected merchandising and such (though to our family's thinking, we've reconciled the plush and theme park versions of Lotso as \\"other Lotsos\\" and not the discarded, bitter bear we saw in the movie.<br /><br />Toy Story 3, like all of Pixar's features and shorts, seem to have a creative vision funneled through a singular director. Even though TS3's director, Lee Unkrich, has been with the franchise since the beginning, this particular film really has Unkrich's humor and intensity.<br /><br />This theory is based on the extensive and detailed audio commentary he does with producer Darla K (for Kay) Anderson, in which explains the stories behind the story decisions and even the little jokes (for instance, Michael Keaton mispronounced \\"library\\" as Ken and Unkrich left it in and overruled requests to the contrary -- and it does get a laugh in theaters). But on a larger scale, if one were to take the caricature of him literally (which you can see in a bonus feature about the crew shaving their heads), he seems to be perceived as a pretty intense fellow.<br /><br />I saw the movie three times in theaters and my family saw it twice. It made me misty eyed every time, both at the beginning and especially at the end. Like Walt Disney's classic animation, these CG-generated creatures have the ability to elicit real emotion from viewers. When Andy explains each toy to little Bonnie, it's truly touching, not contrived for effect. And yet the film is laugh out loud funny in other places, such as Mr. Potato Head's makeshift \\"base bodies.\\" Much of these ideas are explained in the commentary too.<br /><br />Nearly every animated feature today uses celebrity voices, but to the new and carryover casts of Toy Story 3, this isn't just a pick-up-the-check-and-mention-it-to-Leno deal to any of the stars involved here. They know they are part of something special and don't take it lightly, I'm certain. My favorite performances have to be Jodi Benson as Barbie and the aforementioned Keaton as Ken. The apparently did their lines together and the timing pays off (many voice actors, especially stars, do their lines separately). It's even funny when Ken is reading the roll and, angry at his lady doll, call her name out with middle-school disdain (\\"BAR-bie.\\") Things like this make repeated viewings fun.<br /><br />Most of the extras are on the 2 Blu-ray discs, though the commentary and a few of the \\"animatic\\"-style behind the scenes features are also on the single DVD. I was particularly pleased that there is also a narrative audio option for the entire film, so those with sight challenges can enjoy the film as a narrator explains the action. This is actually quite nice as a bonus feature too, because you don't have to stare at the screen and you can get a \\"Disneyland Storyteller\\" LP-type experience.

Its starts off with a bang and ends in a Grisham-esq surprise. Thank you Grisham for shunning the typical 'Hollywood' endings because I abhor reading 400 pages but already know how it will end.

1401309666|4.0|The book mainly based its premise on the emerging of digital entertaining marketing which has changed the way customers interact with industries radically. Customers today have more choices that ever imagine before; resulting in segmenting of markets into numerous tiny niches that serve any possible demand for customers. The author, Chris Anderson, claimed that a market today is a market of multitude of niches products rather than a one big hit product for all. In his book, he laid out the statistics of the best seller albums and the highest earned movies to explain his point.   I like the way he examined the 80/20 rules which generally referred to the facts that 20% of the products or services account for 80% of the revenue. However, as he argued, a company also takes in big portion of revenues collectively from the 80% products that were not in high demand. Interviewed with the CEO of The digital jukebox company called Ecast; the author was surprised to learn that ,out of 10,000 albums, 98% of it were sold at least one track per quarter. This statistic is shocking because it means that the company should continue to add albums to its archives to increase its revenue. By putting some hit albums and many of non-hit albums, the company will gain more revenues; because every non-popular album added to the archives will almost always sell to at least one customer every quarter. This is what Anderson called \\"The long tail\\" which resembled the graph of the high demand with huge numbers at the head of the curve and with the curve falls off steeply and approaches near the end of the graph, but never exactly be zero.   By applying his theory to the online business, we can see that Google, eBay and other online businesses are all, more or less, the long tail. Once a company identifies a long tail of its business, the real challenge is to drive the demand down the tail by offering opportunities to people to move from the \\"hits\\" world into the \\"niches\\" world; The wider the head of the curve, the higher revenue a company brings in--the ultimate goal of a business.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This is by far the best album she's made in a long time. Most people can argue with this since they all will say The Emancipation of Mimi was huge all over the world. However, vocally and the production (specially the orchestra arrangements) of this album are vastly superior than any other.   I'm glad she decided to record another Xmas album, the duet with her mother is absolutely stunning! Beautiful voices, it's so spiritual.    People should stop comparing this album with her 1994's first Xmas' compilation. Can't you just say they're both different and some will prefer the older while others will prefer MCIIU? As simply as that.  Great work Mariah, you've made us proud!!
0385523912|5.0|North Korea is one of the most mysterious places on the planet. Every Western image of it is a carefully calibrated facade which belies a nation living with unconscionable poverty and repression. Here, in Demick's brilliant and vital book, North Korea and its inhabitants come to life in all their tragic reality. Demick shapes her book as small biographies of a small number of defectors who have since found freedom and prosperity in South Korea. Their journeys there, however, are stunning in their series of countless terrible situations, starvations, forced loyalty to an indifferent dictator, and many more examples of NK's unsuccessful communist regime. The writing style is simple to get used to and engaging, even when describing the most unimaginable of horrors, and the book overall is thorough, keenly intelligent, and very readable. One finishes the book informed and enlightened, yet with a feeling of hopelessness, because everything is still exactly the same. Modern history of the highest caliber.
0345505387|1.0|Let it be stated: I am a huge Gabaldon fan and I LOVE the Outlander series.  Naturally, when I learned that Gabaldon would be writing another book, from Jaime's perspective, I got excited all over again.  I sincerely enjoyed the section in The Fiery Cross that allowed readers to, for once, get the story from Jaime's POV!    But The Exile??  Please, if you love Gabaldon's talent for writing and storytelling, don't taint your admiration of her by reading The Exile.  Honestly, I was shocked that as excellent as a writer she is, that she would sign off on a project like that!  Simply stated, the book was remedial, splotchy and more than a bit ridiculous.  I really believe that if they'd had more money or time to put into it, it had the potential to be an AMAZING ordeal.  She could've exposed her story to an entirely different audience!  Unfortunately, it came in way below the mark.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|Evil Dead is a must-see for horror fans.<br /><br />The version I watched was the Special Edition which says \\"Elite Entertainment Presents\\" at the top of the DVD box. It has two commentaries, one with Bruce Campbell talking and another one with the makers of the film Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert talking. It also has as an extra some clips of takes from the making of the movie.<br /><br />I would like to note here that the movie was originally filmed in full screen, so the full screen format on this DVD is the original format for the movie. It was not originally filmed in widescreen. Its a fullscreen movie.<br /><br />The movie is about some college students who go to a cabin in the outdoors to have a good time, but instead they accidently unleash demons. Bruce Campbell who plays Ash is the star of the film. He's great. At the beginning he doesn't yet have his persona down but as the film progresses he matures.<br /><br />\\"Evil Dead\\" is extremely gory and terrifying. The first time I watched it, I watched some parts standing so I could exit the room before it got too scary. In some of the scenes I was so scared that I closed my eyes and covered my ears because I couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />Of the two commentaries that come with the movie the better of the two is the one with Bruce Campbell. He makes really funny comments as the movie goes along and his commentary is very entertaining.<br /><br />Evil Dead gave me the best scare of my life and if your looking for a scary horror film, Evil Dead is the movie to see.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time and leaves you wanting more.  Its grusome and raw,  and I hope theres going to be a season 2.  Their really going to have to scratch their heads to keep come up with ideas on this one.  I enjoy how they are making the viewer have mixed feelings about the cops friend and his wife.

B0013SJ44Q|5.0|The slow beginning of Otis' professional fortunes was boosted by this milestone in soul music. In a nutshell, soul music's definition was emotion. His range of emotion and experience was vast and he conveyed that here with that gritty baritone. The three originals were his best at this point. Although \\"Respect\\" would be \\"stolen\\" just two years later, his version was a classic in its own right. But it was with \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" that he established his true identity as the consummate pleader. It's little wonder this has endured as one of his signature cuts both live and in the studio. He was as deeply involved in his unarguable great taste in covers. He and the band took impressive turns with B.B. King and William Bell. He memorialized Sam Cooke thrice. \\"Shake\\" was the real standout that far outdid the original by stomping and romping it to a fury. Booker T. and the MGs and the Mar-Keys didn't play a subordinate role on this album either. They knew instinctively how to shade and build up intensity in a song. Steve Cropper was one of the funkiest guitarists ever and Al Jackson was amongst history's steadiest timekeepers. With that in mind, this version of \\"Satisfaction\\" was Otis' and the bands' genius at work at getting to the raw sense of a song's character - thereby fulfilling Keith Richards' initial vision.<br /><br />With Otis, the studio and the stage were separable. There's some powerful live stuff that duplicates the studio stuff with some neat twists that reach the breaking point. His alternate takes are pleasant if minor additions. Both the stereo and mono mixes of the album are welcome. He handily sustains this expanded two-disc reissue. More hovering on the horizon I hope.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|Watching \\"Chloe,\\" I felt a little disappointed and misled. While the acting and directing pedigree of the film seems to indicate an intelligent and sophisticated film, the script is really little more than yet another variation on \\"Fatal Attraction.\\"<br /><br />I've seen parts of \\"Natalie\\", the French film \\"Chloe\\" is based on, and from what I saw the film looked like a mature exploration of the disconnection of a middle-aged couple. But \\"Chloe\\" seems to reinforce so many of the tired stereotypes about sex and romance that come from American films ... most notably, the ridiculous idea that a couple who has been together for decades are still supposed to be behaving like they are in the initial infatuation stage of the relationship, and if they're not, that they've somehow \\"lost\\" something.<br /><br />Julianne Moore, one of modern cinema's best actresses, gives the same outstanding performance she gives in pretty much everything she's in. She plays Catherine, a gynecologist whose marriage to a professor has lost its spark over the years. (Well, duh. Juggling two successful careers and raising an almost grown son will do that to a couple.) When Catherine finds reason to suspect that her husband might have had a dalliance with a student, she makes the bizarre decision to hire a doe-eyed escort, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried, who has never looked so delicious) to try and seduce her husband and report back to her.<br /><br />What follows is an even more bizarre and outlandish series of events which proceed to reveal that Chloe, a young woman who clearly has \\"mother issues,\\" is in fact sexually obsessed with Catherine and not, as Catherine fears, attracted to either her husband or barely legal son. Since the film never really gives the audience enough reason to believe in Chloe's feelings or actions, by the end of the film the whole thing really just becomes kind of silly.<br /><br />Chloe might be worth a watch for its good performances, sumptuous art direction, and sexual titillation. But it doesn't offer much intelligent insight into the subjects of relationships, sexuality, or prostitution.h intelligent insight into the subjects of relationships, sexuality, or prostitution.

1416955070|4.0|One of my best friends told me to read this series probably a little over a year ago and she lent me City Of Ashes to read when I was done with the first. Well, I FINALLY decided to read it and I am SO glad that I did.<br /><br />Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, Warlocks, Shadowhunters, and a bunch of other creatures all wrapped up in a pretty package called City of Bones.<br /><br />Clary thinks that her father died before she was born, that her mother is a painter, and that her mother's best friend and the only father figure she's really ever know, Luke, is a book store owner (can he be my mom's best friend too?). But one fateful night changes everything she ever thought she knew. When she goes out with her best friend, Simon, to the club Pandemonium she sees a girl and two boys corner another boy in a storage room, tie him up, and try to stake him, but she intervenes before it happens. While she freaks out not knowing why they are about to do that, Isabelle, Alec, and Jace (the aforementioned teens that are also Shadowhunters that cornered the other kid who turns out to actually be a demon) wonder how it is that Clary can see them. She is only a mundane (human), and mundanes don't have the Sight to see them and past glamors. But Clary does.<br />After this night, Clary's life is turned upside down when her mother gets kidnapped by another powerful and dark Shadowhunter, Valentine. Her life is also intertwined with Jace's in more ways then she could imagine.<br />She is racing to find a way to save her mom all while finding out the truth behind all the lies her mother has fed her all her life.<br /><br />Now, by all means, this is not an original story. There is a pretty wicked twist towards the end that my best friend told me about when she first told me to read it...but it still took me by surprise. But other than that, nothing groundbreaking or genre defining original. I did end up totally loving Jace though. He is a really good character. And he made me laugh. A lot. He's overly confident and some of the stuff he says is just classic.<br />Some of the writing style was a little strange. I didn't understand why Clare chose to use some words because they just didn't seem to fit and she kind of over-used \\"so and so looked just as *insert some kind of emotion here* as Clary did\\". I swear I counted at least 5 times or more. I was always wondering why Clary never really looked the emotion she felt. She wasn't the kind of person to hide or push aside what she was feeling.<br /><br />City of Bones was a fun read though and I am curious as to what happens in City of Ashes and City of Glass so I will definitely be continuing with this series.ome of the stuff he says is just classic.

B00406UK7S|5.0|For anyone who enjoys historical movies and action movies, this one is for you.  The movie is well made highlighting a legendary event (that probably never occurred) of the massacre of the 9th legion in 118 AD.    That event and the lead up is only the beginning of the story, however.  The main story is the attempt of 7 soldiers to escape the Picts after this massacre and return safely to Roman Britain and their trials and tribulations on the way.    Their travels take them through Scotland and the scenery is breathtaking.  The mountains, the snow, the cliffs, etc. and all of this was filmed right there in nature.    The battle scenes are violent and bloody.  The director and his staff leave nothing to your imagination as people's heads are chopped off; people are impaled on spears (either through the body or face); etc.  At times, I found myself having to turn away from the screen because of the violence (especially during the massacre scene of the 9th legion).    The fight scenes, however, you can tell are well choreographed, especially the fight at the end in the fort. Some reviews claim that you can't really care about the people in the story, but at the end, I found myself hoping that they would survive, especially the Centurion, played by Michael Fassbender (who I thought did an excellent job acting).    All in all, this is a very realistic and well made film depicting life in that brutal time.  This is highly recommended for anyone interested in Roman history.
1416972242|4.0|I was planning on reading another book after I read City of Bones, but when I finished CoB I couldn't wait. So I went right into the second Mortal Instruments book. And now I have to wait til I can get to the store to buy City of Glass. Urgh. I hate waiting...especially to get books that are in series.<br /><br />The tension between everyone in this book is great. Pretty much everyone is dealing with some kind of relationship woes.<br /><br />Valentine is up to some tricks again. He has stolen the Soul-Sword and is planning on using it in some way to over-throw the Clave.<br />Clary's mother is in a coma and nothing her or Luke do seems to help.<br />After Jace has a run in with Valentine the Inquisitor is called in to test whether he is lying or not about being a spy for Valentine. But she needs the Soul-Sword to do that and she finds it very suspicious that Valentine steals it right when it is needed. She seems to really hate Jace, like she has a personal vendetta against him. Isabelle and Alec's mom doesn't believe that Jace isn't helping Valentine either. So much drama.<br /><br />I loved Jace in this book. Well, I loved him the first one, but his character development in CoA was great. Every single thing he thought he knew about himself turns out to be a lie and he's not sure how to deal with it. Even though he puts on the tough guy facade there are some scenes where he is just broken.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Jace is in the Silent City. The fear is intense and it's just so emotion-filled that it really stays with you.<br />This is a good read for the YA Fantasy lover.
B0024FAG6M|5.0|Put Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson together and you have an iconic film about the crash landing that was the end of the Sixties in America.  The making-of documentary included in this disc is an absolute must after seeing the film - the insight you get into how it was put together is both funny and amazing.  I can see how this may appeal more to Baby Boomers than those born after 1970, but everyone should enjoy Easy Rider.  The ending is powerful and makes a lasting impact.
0143118420|3.0|I got this book many months ago when I saw that Julie Roberts was in the movie and I LOVE Julia Roberts so I decided to read it before I watched the movie.<br /><br />Basically it's a story about a woman who has everything, but wants none of it.<br />She is unhappy in her marriage for many reasons (which she discloses very few of)and decides to leave her husband after a very messy breakdown on her bathroom floor. Apparently she cannot handle being alone though, because she quickly falls in love with her rebound lover. But, as most rebound relationships go, they end up not working out after a series of break-ups and get-back-togethers. Which of course, this devastates her, as well.<br />Gilbert wants to run away and travel but cannot afford it. But wait, publishers to the rescue! They end up paying for her trip since she is going to write about it, so now she can go.<br /><br />Now, since she starts off the book by telling you everything that she has in life, but how all of it is wrong and not what she wanted, she comes off as...selfish...and self-centered. But Gilbert is witty and a people person, so that helps as she tells you about her travels. And she is honest about herself and what she has done which also helps.<br />In Italy and India she is great. I love that she really starts to find herself, create herself, and center herself (and Italy is where she 'learns' to eat and India she 'learns' to pray). Bali is where she is supposed to learn how to love. And after finishing this book I sat and thought about where the love was. The whole book leads and builds up to this point and then it just plops. I don't know, the ending just really bothered me and I cannot go more into with out spoiling some of the story.<br />I disagreed with her most of the time (especially using God as an excuse to get out of her marriage), but it was kind of interesting to read, even though I felt very unsatisfied after finishing it.<br />In my opinion overall it was only an \\"alright\\" book.
B001G8XON0|2.0|This review is not on the movie; it's one of my favorites and we had been waiting for the Blu-ray for sometime thinking it would be incredible.  Unfortunately, the Blu-ray is not good at all; the picture at times appears grainy and I can see no difference in the DVD vs the Blu-ray.  It seems no effort was put into this transfer and the result is very disappointing.
B003IDEX04|5.0|I was supposed to read this book in middle school, but I chose not to because I knew the story already and I was home schooled so I could do stuff like that. I chose not to read it because I was a big chicken. It made me sad just thinking about it and I did not want to read about what this girl who was my age was having to go through.<br />Now, just about 10 years later I decided it was time to man up....erhmm...I mean, woman up and read it. I had been missing out on so much. It was beautiful, inspiring, and tragic.<br /><br />This girl starts out with everything and gets it all ripped away from her simply because she is Jewish. Anne's diary starts off a few days before they have to go into hiding, then for the remainder of the time they are in their \\"Secret Annexe\\" .<br />What I loved about it is that she is just a regular girl. She's not trying to write anything special, just the goings on in their secret life. How they eat, how they sleep, how they go to the bathroom. How one day she feels so grown up and independent and the next she needs everyone around her. How she misses school and cannot wait to go back.<br />There is always an underlying fear though, that they will get caught and sent to a concentration camp and die there, or not even make it that far and just get killed the second they are found. But she is almost always optimistic. Writing about how when the war ends and they get to leave their hiding place she is going to take all of her notes and scribbles and make them into a book about how those years in hiding were.<br />It has such a sad ending though. I knew it was coming but I couldn't help myself wishing and praying that something would change. So if you are not in the mood for a tear jerker, you should probably postpone reading this one. I say postpone because I now will not encourage skipping it entirely. It is too good of a story.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|I have liked a good revenge movie since Charles Bronson did some house cleaning in Death Wish. The victimization has to be brutal and over-the-top to warrant the revenge at hand. No one on earth deserves Sarah's brutality and degradation, thus the sickos could not deserve their come-uppance more. I believe the punishment should fit the crime..and Sarah's character does a fine, yet preposterous job.It doesn't take the victims' suffering away, but she assures they won't do this to anyone else. Revenge,anyone?  This fills the bill.Good acting,too, and loved the special featurette, especially talking with the bad guys and some of the difficulty in making this work, even tho it deals with a horrible, yet all to real, situation.
B003F9G8B8|2.0|Unfortunately this film does not do a great story justice.  The script struck me as simplistic, flat, and utterly predictable.
B001E57SH8|1.0|Nice lighter but peeling off the label on side left the glue all over and required acetone to remove. Acetone on a lighter? Go into your warehouse and try to get the label off ten of these lighters yourself. Would have expected better from a product made in USA. Not happy camper.
B003OAL58E|5.0|A disturbing portrait of a small village examining various abuses of authority and their effect on individuals and society overall.  Great attention to set detail in regards to historical accuracy, and a superb cast selection.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|Pretty much disappointed in the final cut.  I was expecting a little more at the ending.  It is pretty much the same as the original movie disc except the voice over from Harrison Ford is missing.  I rather prefer the original disc as I could care less about the interviews on the second disc.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|The movie was excellently done!!! Great storyline. Entertainment for the whole family. Jaden Smith did an excellent job.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Great package. I must be honest, I can't see much difference between 720 p and 1080 p.   Episodes seem a lil' longer but might b e just me noticing little pieces I didn't before.  The extras are once again fantastic and It's a way to get closure to this great show...  I will miss LOST and it's characters, Locke's faith, Jack restlessness, Kate's beauty, even Sawyer's nicknames.  Sayd's torture, Jin and Sun korean, Claire's madness, Richard's imortality and Ben, my favorite and his cynical heart.  Finale itself...let's not get into that! Recall all 6 years of wonderful memories and week after week theories.  Is it purgatory, are they dead? Are we in purgatory watching this show with no answers week in  and out?  No! we're just watching TV history in the making once again. Like before with X files, Seinfeld, Friends and others.  (not the hostile others...other shows) This will stay forever in west culture for good or bad.   For me a great show, final season packed into this wonderful set. Buy it, Namaste!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I've always loved Joe's early work for it's subtlety and complexity, and more unusual riffs and melodies. His current/recent work with Chickenfoot is much more adolescent, simplistic and less interesting than his earliest work, which was much more sophisticated, in my view. This album has some nice textures, great tone (love that he's playing through Marshalls again), interesting melodies, good dynamics, and is beautifully recorded. I've always found the albums that grow on you seem to get listened to more than others, and this is one of those for me. Anyone want to buy a Chickenfoot CD? Only played once...
1400076943|3.0|This is my first novel by Chimamanda Adichie whom I have been wanting to read for some time now. The book is about a family living in Nigeria under the strict rule of the devoutly Catholic father, Eugene. Our narrator is the daughter of the family, Kambili, who is fifteen and terrified of her father. Kambili's life work is to please her father. The other family members are the mother, Beatrice and a son, Jaja. Eugene is a tyrant that subjects them all to mental and physical abuse all in the name of religion.<br /><br />Honestly, I have been nursing this book for some time. I have picked it up an put it down continually over the past few months. The beginning was so slow. It was like walking through mud. Towards the end things began to pick up because we were introduced to the character, Aunty Ifeoma. Aunty Ifeoma is Eugene's sister. She is a free spirit, a widower, and a mother to three lively children. It is when Kambili and Jaja go to visit them that they start to blossom and come into themselves. Aunty Ifeoma's children are not bound by rigid religious traditions and rules. Kambili is the character that had the most growth. She broke out of her shell and got in touch with her own emotions instead of them being dictated by her father. The ending was sad and shocking.<br /><br />In my opinion, the book took a while to develop. There is nothing about this story that has left a lasting impression on me.
B003405MF6|5.0|This is one of those albums that, if you expect the old Jeff Beck, you may be disappointed. Maybe it's because I'm getting older and my musical tastes are changing, but even though I often listen to my many Jeff Beck albums from WAY back, I really enjoy this new work by Jeff. It seems that one of the more difficult things for a musician to deal with is the expectations of fans, and the challenges that can cause when they want to change directions or evolve in their playing or musical genre. Jeff Beck is so iconic that it would be easy to expect him to stay within a musical groove; after all, he still cuts his hair the same way and wears the same types of clothes! Emotion and Commotion is, to me, a beautiful, dynamic and sophisticated album that really delivers after a few listenings, and has what it takes (Beck's tone, feel, and incomparable playing style) to be a memorable album. I'm not good at writing reviews of every song, so will just say, buy it and listen to it a few times. If you like unique, tasty, Jeff Beck guitar work, excellent vocals, and great arrangements, this should do it for you.

0345472322|5.0|\\"Mindset\\" was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It examined failure and how people deal with it - do they cave or use it as a learning tool?  It explained so many things that have happened in my past.  This book should be required reading of all parents and teachers.

1439102813|2.0|Having read several non-fiction books on Alzheimer disease, I was looking for something different in a work of fiction. I expected to care about the characters. I expected to close the book and to be haunted by the characters. In fairness, I did finish the book and was moved at several points. However, Professor Genova is not yet a fiction writer, and this made her book a painful experience. From the first paragraph, I knew this to be the case -- her book does not read well and is clunky with lists and painful, high school-ish descriptions. Again and again, Genova violated the simplest of principles: show not tell. If Genova is committed to becoming a fiction writer, she should take a serious writing workshop. She should seek out the most brutal critics she can find. Not everyone is cut out for fiction, and that's okay.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've seen Jillian on The Biggest Loser a few times, so I decided to try this workout. She gives me the verbal butt-kicking I need to stay motivated! The DVD is great -- I started as a beginner on the first level and within a week I was onto the second level. It really makes you sweat and get a much harder workout than you would expect from such a short routine. I highly recommend this DVD.
B000001F6A|3.0|This CD was shipped promptly and was as described, but was a old BMG issue.  I did not remember how bad the old releases were.  I downloaded another Moody Blues album (children's,children's,children) that was the newest reissue and it was much better sounding.  I will pay more attention to the issue date in the future.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks` books but this one is one of his best yet. He keeps you on the edge of your seat for the last 5 chapters! Must read for everyone!
0316069485|4.0|This novel features both Inspector Harry Bosch and his half brother Mickey Haller and their respective families (including the two ex-wives of Haller).  It is more a courtroom drama then the typical police investigation, but Bosch is drawn in as the investigator for the case, a retrial of a convicted child killer who had been convicted 24 years earlier and appealed.  Much of the novel is on legal procedures, so you may be put off if looking for the usual Harry Bosch investigation.  Some of the police procedures seem a little unreal, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  Overall, the main plot is OK.<br /><br />I do wish authors would be a little more careful with their research to avoid annoying errors.  In this case, the car ferry from Seattle does not run to Port Townsend - it runs to Winslow, and you have to drive from there.  Also, the residents of Port Townsend would never, never, call it a village.  There is a time warp in having a new artisan settle in the outskirts of the town.  That often happened 30 years ago, but the town and its outlying areas have become an upscale retirement and tourist destination.  Property now has a high price, and it is doubtful that a relatively new artisan would choose the area.

1932100660|5.0|I was given this book last spring, put off reading it, but once I started I could not put it down.  It is a fascinating study giving insight into the scarey illnesses we all fear.  Perhaps we do not need to worry about cancer, heart disease etc if we are willing to change our eatting habits.  I am sure that many people involved in our present food chain do not want us to make these changes, but we shall be better off for the changes. I have lent out my copy and bought two more for my children. I consider it a must read.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|This is a great 3D demo disc. Lots of excellent scenery shots. I would give this 5 start if it weren't for the fact that its one big environmentalist recruiting device. I don't need to pay $20 to be preached at about conservation. I get enough of that on TV.    Other than that, the PQ is sharp and clear with some great 3D.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|In Treatment was originally aired on HBO. Paul is the therapist and he has four patients: Laura, Alex, Sophie, and a couple: Jake & Amy, that participate in weekly treatment. This series goes over sensitive content such as suicide and attempts, sex and sexual abuse, abortion, marital issues, etc. This series is recommended for a mature audience. The patient structures the therapy, which is generally free association. By the fourth episode, you'll wonder, \\"how does this guy put up with all the crap these people give him?\\" Episode five, Paul goes to see Gina, his ex mentor, who is also a therapist- but retired at this point in time. He blows off steam from the week and Gina helps him deal with the stress of life and his patients. Who said therapists don't need to talk to someone too?
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Here Chicago is back to the double album format with mixed results. My favorite song from this album is the 6 min Jazz instrumental Aire. Also Call On Me has a nice arrangement along with Wishing You Were Here. The later has to be the best Chicago ballad ive ever heard featuring The Beach Boys on backup vocals. Update  September,2012<br /><br />The More i listen to this album the more i like it, more of the songs have grown on me. Listen to Danny Seraphine's drumming on Devil's Sweet. Also doesent Lee Loughnane sound a bit like Terry Kath on Song Of The Evergreens winter is coming and Song Of The Evergreens is the perfect snow song.Towards the end of the song the whole band starts singing snow, snow, snow over and over again a bit strange but i never shut it off. Ive Been Searchin So Long was a song i wasnt crazy about years ago it starts off to sappy but then gets better. Women Dont Want To Love Me i shake my head because when i ended my Chicago collection back in December,2010 i somehow never added this song to one of my Chicago best of mixes. I dont see how that song got overlooked its super catchy Peter Cetera give a great vocal and the horn arrangement is one of the catchiest James Pankow has ever written.Of all Chicago's double albums this is the only one i feel could have been a single album. If i had the opportunity to turn it into a single album here is how the track listing would go.<br /><br />1. Aire<br />2. Devil's Sweet<br />3. Italian From New York (Cant decide on this one yet, its like nothing they have done before)<br />4. Call On Me<br />5. Happy Man<br />6. Ive Been Searchin So Long<br />7. Wishing You Were Here<br />8. Song Of The Evergreens<br />9. Woman Dont Want To Love Me<br /><br />That would have made a perfect single album. The song Life Saver is laugh out loud terrible i always skip that one. Byblos would be my next pick if the album had to have ten songs.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|It's diverse and that's always a good thing in music.Joe sounds a little more quite in the pocket on some songs,Giving his sound more breathing run to mess with your head.Which I feel keeps the Lister more in the game.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I liked the stories in this movie.  But if you've done any reading on the subject, like Manchester's [[ASIN:0316501115 Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War]] then this is not a new subject.  Indeed, when one looks at the old John Wayne movie [[ASIN:0782010040 Sands of Iwo Jima]] it could be argued that Wayne's movie is better.  That is the rub with this series.  Band of Brothers is one of the best mini-series ever made on HBO and is equal or better than most WWII movies on the subject.  The old movie [[ASIN:B000WC39SG A Bridge Too Far [Blu-ray]]] isn't as good as Band of Brothers.  Conversely, John Wayne plays a compelling Marine Sergeant in Sands of Iwo Jima and that movie is better than \\"The Pacific\\".      The movie starts off with Robert Leckie telling a woman in a church that he is off the Marines.  When you read Robert Leckie's book [[ASIN:0553593315 Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific]] in the first page the thing he really remembers is the Marines forced him to get circumcised before he could enlist and he's complaining about the pain.  The video is a little different than the book, don't you think?  Eugene Sledge is the story is the same way.  In this series we see somebody who is sickly and becomes a Marine.  In the book Mr. Sledge was at a military academy and enlisted in the Marines because he believed that he was going to miss the was if he had stayed at the academy.    \\"The Pacific\\" starts off with the Marines being placed on Guadalcanal and the soldiers seeing the sinking of the US Navy Fleet during the Battle of Savo Island (the worst beating the US Navy ever had in a battle).  That was pretty good special effects.  The casual viewer is shown what it's like for the Marines.  Their uniforms were rotting off their bodies.  They ate captured Japanese rice that was infested with maggots.  The Marines endured many Japanese suicide attacks.  It is fairly good but what is missed is the Marines underwent nearly nightly ship bombardments.  The viewer is shown one bombardment that lasts for a minute.  The Marines on Guadalcanal had a Japanese battleship empty its guns on them; one of the few times American service members had to endure a battleship bombardment.    I liked the Guadalcanal treatment.  But doing that could have been a whole mini series by itself and an adaptation of the book [[ASIN:0935553045 Guadalcanal: Starvation Island]] would not get HBO a lot of viewers.    I did like the cut away to Australia.  I didn't know that the Marines sent the Marines to Australia to have the men recover from the ordeal at Guadalcanal.  This reminded me of the better parts that the American soldiers had in Europe.  Hats off to the producers for this and a big thumb up.  It sounds like Mr. Leckie's Marines had the time of their life in Australia.  The stories with the women are half true and half fiction.  The fiction is the family stories.  The fact is the women were accomidating to the Marines.      Most of the characters meet up at a central location, the island of Pavuvu; the Marine Corps main depot island in the Pacific.  This is a little made up but was done to bring continuity to the story.  In the post mid-1943 period it was logistically easier to have the marines at Pavuvu than ship them back to Australia.  Pavuvu is a nasty little island that is infested with crabs and rats.  But after the Marines are subject to the horrors of miserable islands like Peleliu it's better than nothing.  At least the food is constant and the medical attention is good.    At Pavuvu the second groups of characters take over from \\"Lucky's\\" group of Marines.  This is based off the book [[ASIN:0891419195 With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]].  This is where the series really falls down and falls down hard.  Iwo Jima's set is unconvincing.  The sets are a series of rocky hills that are used and re-used.  A viewer can see that Iwo's set looks like Peleliu 's set looks like Okinawa's set.  This isn't good and it actually starts having a cheap made-for-TV look that half ruined network TV back in the seventies and eighties.  What was HBO thinking?  Also, this reviewer is an equipment geek.  One Amtrack is used in the series and one M-4 Sherman is used.      The viewer is really cheated if they think this series captures Okinawa.  Okinawa was nightmarish for all the participants in WWII.  Japanese bombers would attack the fleet at night and the sky would light up with thousands of tracers.  Ships would explode and could be seen from the beach.  Japanese suicide bombers would run under tanks and blow themselves up.  The Army and Marines have different ways of fighting and this causes lots of deaths when the US Army would pull back from a position allowing the Marines to be flanked.      I will give any good WWII series three stars.  This is a good series but it hardly touches the surface of what the Marines went through.  Honestly, one is better served by watching Sands of Iwo Jima with John Wayne (link above) or watching this old video [[ASIN:B00005PJ8K Guadalcanal Diary]].      I rented \\"The Pacific\\".  I would not buy it.  It's a good three star rental but the characters are not that compelling.  Boot Camp, a miserable experience for any Marine, is not shown in this series.  The producers try to do too much with too little.  And like putting too little butter on a large piece of bread it just does not work well.    And that is the real pity of this video.  Now, the people who like the Navy and the Marines will give this five stars.  But the typical reviewer will only give this three stars and watch it only once or twice.

0439023513|3.0|~Major Spoilers~       At the start, i didnt feel up to reading MockingJay until i had to read the whole book over this weekend.My friends told me it was good and i was procrastinating on reading.  I do have to give Ms.Collins on a few writing aspects that i see very little and i appriceate.   1) Her use of present time insetead of past tense. i was suprised to see this( 95% books are written in past tense, even my stories i use past tense). Its a subtle detail that i enjoy.      To be honest, my first day, after reading about 200 pages, i really enjoyed it. the begining didn't catch me as much as i would think it would have, though not a lot of books do. There were many things that i didn't enjoy including: at least 60% of what happens at the begining of the story and throughout it is filler. I didnt quite enjoy the \\"utopian\\"(in Panem's terms) society of 13. 13 seemed to be well equip in every possible way and ,in my opioin, almost unimiaginably. How did they, without any knowledge or help from the rest of the world, survive 70+ years as subterran humans. I would have enjoyed it if Collins would have given more backstory to the history of 13 and more importantly the DEVOLEPEMENT of 13 other than saying, \\"'...we faced many hardships...'\\".     A thing that clung onto my mind the whole time was why in the world is Gale so...i dont know...clingy. He is way overprotective and is not the noncholant male we met in the first book. In this book, he is all but *for the use of a better word* stalking...Katniss. Gale, again, gets too much importance placed in him with next to no backstory.     Katniss in this story really, REALLY, pissed me off. From the start she went in this cycle...Regular Girl--> Girl that is the breadwinner of the family -->Deadly fighter--->Emo, depressed girl. Katniss seemed so out of character, not strong, nor did she retain most of her characterists from the first two books. She was just...broken in this book and it really, REALLY, made me mad.      The whole \\"hijacking\\" bid with Petta was a good idea implimented wrong. He went from Mad-->91% Mad--->2% mad in a course of a few weeks. the poison, supposedly used to last forever, was too weak **though they said it was given mulitple times constantly**  than Collins portrayed. This would have gone better if the poison, that the doctors said tehy knew NOTHING about, was a bigger obsticle than a constant, empty threat.     I really enjoyed some of the new characters/personailies(old Characters) that she did. The sober Haymitch was enjoyable for a while, though she reduced him back to the sniffeling drunk that he was always.     The next topic, and probably my most pissed off one yet, was the deaths. Collins threw in people left and right, who she killed off fast before you got to know the characters. Finnick, who i really enjoyed, was mentally handicapped half the book, then killed off in a such abrupt way that i had to re read over the page of his death before i realized he was dead. His death was just, in a word, stupid. Finnick's death was just pointless and really unnessicary. Primrose(Prim)'s death surpised me. I literally didn't know she had died, for the fact that all it said was there was a med. unit worker with a blonde braid and that mouthed Katniss's name, until i read to the part about President Snow where Kat. is picking a rose. Prim's death was not needed.     This book is really good for the first 300 pages. After that, in my opinion, it is crap. To be specific, the last 40 odd pages annoyed me. I think Collins slacked off for the fact that it was the end of the series. the last line, \\"But there are many more deadly games to be played\\" stuck in my head for a while and then i realized that line was a load of crap. its a corny ending to a mediocere book that is in a good sereies. The ending, a mere 2 pages to summerize the rest of Katniss's and Peeta's lives together, was bland and child's level writing. The fact that it described a course of 15+ years in a short period is just crap. I was horrible disappointed in her idea of using children playing on a cemetery as teh ending; corny.    ~End of Spoilers~  Overall: This book is a decent way to end the Hunger Games series. The last 40((give or take a few)) pages are a disappointment as was the whole rest of the life of Katniss. Collins did a mediocre job that, good in some places, lacked in others. The first 300 pages are a wonder when they are of use, though some is pointless filler that could have been used at other areas. A decent book overall, i reccomend IF you want to conclude the series. If you are extemely picky you will be bothered by the ending and that seems to be the major disappointment.

And now   that I've got two grandchildren, I certainly can appreciate her song 'Never grow up!'  I have her other albums too   but this one is very good.  Thanks Taylor!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This movie is a more realistic take on the classic Cinderella story. Many movies claim to be real Cinderella stories, but this one seriously delivers. It has epic dialogue and beautiful cinematography. It's set back in like the seventeen hundreds and it surely takes you on a trip through time. Drew Barrymore is so good at conveying emotion and keeping you in the movie. There wasn't a point during this movie where i felt that what was supposed to be happening wasn't actually happening. It has been my favorite movie since i was seven and   I'm sure you'll love it!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have had these headphones for four years, they still sound and feel as good as the day I got them. Sound is remarkable, like being there. I have worn these for hours with no ear pain or discomfort of any kind. I have had many different brands and type of head phones, these top them all, for almost any price. Bose sets are far over priced for about the same or less sound quality. These are the best I have ever had for sound reproduction of mostly classic rock. Will buy another set when these where out, if they ever do. I do treat them with the respect and care such an important part of my music experience deserves, they have not fell apart or one side stopped working as others have said, you need to just treat them like a fine piece of equipment they are, they are not meant to be thrown around and the wiring tugged on, they are not a toy. For anyone that appreciates good sound of their music these are the ones to get. Buy them and sit back and enjoy.<br />Update : I have now had these for {8} years, still the best sound I've ever heard in head phones !

0201633612|4.0|I thought this was a great book on OOD, but I would be careful on how far you take it.    What I think it's useful for is understanding the different ways that you can design a piece of software.  That doesn't mean that you should be cookie-cutter about it though.    It's like... seeing abstract art, realism, black and white, etc will help you be a better artist.  It'll help introduce you to difference way that you could represent something.  That doesn't mean that you should imagine something you want to paint and say \\"oh, this looks like a time for abstract!\\" and apply the other artist's approach verbatim.    OOD is the same way.  You should absolutely read this book to introduce you to different ways of designing classes and methods.  Things like the Factory class or Singleton class may have never occurred to you.  But don't start trying to force-fit one of these design patterns to any all problems.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Now, don't get me wrong, I loved season one of Legend of the Seeker, but season two takes the show to a whole new level. While I gave the first season 4/5 stars due to the shaky first few episodes, I have no hesitation in giving the second season a well-deserved 5/5 stars. Season two is, in a word, epic. It is truly one of the best seasons of any show I have ever seen (EVER). Why is it so brilliant? For one thing, cast. Cara Mason, played by Tabrett Bethel, who was introduced in the season one finale, is promoted to a main character in season two, and she is a wonderful addition to the show. Funny, awesome, tragic and a hardcore warrior (let's not forget the leather catsuit), she's an all-around great character (though Kahlan's still my favorite). Bridget Regan and Bruce Spence as Kahlan and Zedd, respectively, are excellent as ever, and, thankfully, Craig Horner's acting and character have both improved (Richard actually *thinks* in this season, and actually has some pretty good ideas). Locations and soundtrack are still stunning, and the show for the most part dispenses with the slow-mo action scenes (thank the Creator).  And now, the plot! Well, what can I say besides WOW. In the first episode it transpires that the events of the season one finale have opened a rift between the Land of the Living and the Underworld (the Land of the Dead). The Keeper, the Lord of the Underworld, takes this opportunity to try to take over the Land of the Living. And that's all I will reveal! I could go on and on about Legend of the Seeker: Season Two, but I don't want to spoil it. Just watch it, it is just plain EPIC (I keep using that word...and yes, it does mean EXACTLY what I think it means).  Also, now that Legend of the Seeker has been canceled *boo hiss*, everyone should join the Save Our Seeker campaign! We MUST have a third season!
1423113381|5.0|Let me first start off by thanking Mr. Riordan for his gift of creating amazing tales that craft from his mind along with the myths we've come to learn.  This first book in The Kane Chronicles is an absolute homerun for what's certain to be an amazing trilogy.  Carter and Sadie Kane are split up after the death of their mother, and years later (technically they meet up twice a year), reunite one terryfying night while at that British museum when their father's plans go terribly wrong and the Egyptians gods are released into the modern world.  And from there, the story really takes off as secrets are discovered, dangers are lurking, and magic is significant.    My favorite character by far was Sadie Kane.  Don't get me wrong, Carter was, and still will be, a likable character as he set the balance between the two.  But Sadie was a complete riot with her sharp tongue and witty humor towards the other characters (specifically Carter) and it was much fun to read from her perspective.  I also very much enjoyed Khufu the babboon (who know babboons could do so much?) and Zia Rashid.  The way this first book in the trilogy ended, definitely leaves room for more excitement, revelations, and comedy.    May cannot come soon enough!!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|First of all, I'd just like to say, I love this show. Never having seen it while it was on, I watched the first episode on the Internet, then the very next day went out and bought it on DVD, and watched the entire first season in one night. It is addictive. I remember seeing ads for it when it came out, and I was familiar with the works of Terry Goodkind (never read them, but my sister had), and I absolutely worship Fantasy, however, I just couldn't get over the lame title. I mean, Legend of the Seeker? Really? I still think it's one of the worst titles ever. And yet, this show is one of the best Fantasy shows I have ever seen. It's got all the High Fantasy tropes and cliches (wizards, witches, warriors, destiny, prophecies, dark lords, etc.), and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it's also got a rich mythology all its own (the Confessors and the Mord'Sith being the stand-outs). Add in true love, swashbuckling sword-and-sorcery scenes, and the stunning scenery porn of New Zealand, and you've got a Fantasy show for the ages. The reason I gave this four stars, not five, is because A.) There's far too much slow-mo (seriously, whoever thought up the idea of using slow-mo in action scenes ought to be handed over to Mistress Denna ASAP), and B.) The first seven episodes are a bit shaky. However, by the eighth episode (there's 22 in all), the show starts to become great, and by the tenth it becomes downright brilliant. And you know what? Season two is even better. It's a crime that this extraordinary show was canceled after just two seasons, but it was to be expected; good shows rarely last long.

0345505387|3.0|Basically The Exile is Outlander with a lot more of Jamie thrown in, which I think we can all admit is a welcome addition.  It's been a few years since I read the novel Outlander, and I was a little loss as to who some of the minor characters were (the fact that they all had red hair and were related did not help clear up my confusion).  Still, I enjoyed Jamie and Claire's romance, probably more in the graphic novel than in the book.      I'm a fan of graphic novels, but I'm still new to the genre.  I think the artistry was beautiful, and thought the writing pretty good for trying to sum up Outlander plot.  I'll happily buy more graphic novels about Jamie.  I read The Exile during a 24 Hour Readathon, and the graphic novel was a great break from some of the more lengthy novels I was tackling.  If you're a fan of Outlander, especially of Jamie, or are just looking to start treading into the graphic novel genre, then I think you'd like the Exile.  It didn't blow me away, but it kept me entertained even during the wee hours of morning!

B001MW0J2O|1.0|It's almost impossible for me to believe that anyone actually likes this crap.  I think that since it won the Village Voice Pazz 'n' Jop poll and is the darling of all the critics, people just convince themselves that they like it.  It's repetitive, monotonous, unmelodic, dull, pretentious, unbearable.      It's okay, though.  I once tried to be hip and learn to like stuff because I was supposed to.  Because the hipsters and critics said it was great.  What happens, see, is that critics have to listen to way more new music than you and me.  They get bored with stuff that sounds like something they've ever heard before.  Therefore, they swoon over something that sounds new and different.  The trouble is, most things that sound new and different are pretentious s*** that will be completely forgotten in a year or two.  I could throw a bunch of sound together (in a major key if I wanted to sound like AC) without any rhyme, reason, melody, structure, or sense, and probably catch the ear of several of the critics.  But it would still be crap.  Like Animal Collective's MPP.  Do not be fooled.  Buy something you really like.  Not something that you're supposed to like.
B0041CGP02|5.0|First let me say that I'm amongst the younger generation of Bon Jovi fans. I was born in 1985, so I wasn't an avid music fan until the 'Crush' album. From there, I had to work my way backwards, and though I've listened to every album (incl. '100,000,000 BJ Fans Can't Be Wrong') beginning to end, the fans that were listening to Bon Jovi while they were on the rise in the 80's and early 90's might be able to give you a more accurate depiction of how well this Greatest Hits album represents Bon Jovi through the years. However, I'm gonna take a stab at it.<br /><br />The album is divided into two discs of which feature 16 and 12 songs, respectively. All but two songs on either CD are previously released songs/singles spanning Bon Jovi's 25+ years in the music business. The first thing I looked for was album representation, and I was disappointed to find that only nine of the band's eleven studio albums were featured. I'll quickly break it down for you:<br /><br />Bon Jovi: 1 song - \\"Runaway\\"<br />7800º Fahrenheit - None<br />Slippery When Wet: 3 songs - \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\", \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\", \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\"<br />New Jersey: 5 songs - \\"Bad Medicine\\", \\"Born To Be My Baby\\", \\"I'll Be There For You\\", \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\", \\"Blood On Blood\\"<br />Keep The Faith: 3 songs - \\"In These Arms\\", \\"Keep The Faith\\", \\"Bed Of Roses\\"<br />These Days: 2 songs - \\"This Ain't A Love Song\\", \\"These Days\\"<br />Crush: 1 song - \\"It's My Life\\"<br />Bounce: None<br />Have A Nice Day: 2 songs - \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home (feat. Jennifer Nettles)\\", \\"Have A Nice Day\\"<br />Lost Highway: 2 songs - \\"Lost Highway\\", \\"(You Want To) Make A Memory\\"<br />The Circle: 2 songs - \\"We Weren't Born To Follow\\", \\"When We Were Beautiful\\"<br /><br />- The other three previously released songs are \\"Always\\" and \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\\", from the greatest hits album 'Cross Road' in 1994, and \\"Blaze Of Glory\\", first released in 1990 on Jon Bon Jovi's solo album of the same title.<br /><br />You see it yourself. While the 'New Jersey' album is easily the highest regarded on this compilation, '7800º Fahrenheit' and 'Bounce' were not represented at all. While I understand neither was by any means a defining album for Bon Jovi, both needed to be recognized on here as part of the band's repertoire, especially \\"In & Out Of Love.\\" Also, in my opinion, 'Bounce' could have been represented by either 'Everyday' or 'Misunderstood', preferably the latter if you ask me. While neither song was ever a major cog in the Bon Jovi machine (especially in the U.S.), both singles were present on various charts throughout the world and \\"Everyday\\" was even nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Group With Vocal.<br /><br />Four other songs I thought should've made the cut:<br />** \\"Raise Your Hands\\" from 'Slippery When Wet' - Also one of, if not the best live song the band does, in my opinion (from the two times I saw Bon Jovi live)<br />** \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" from 'Slippery When Wet' - This is probably the most glaring exclusion on the album; reached #11 on the U.S. Mainstream rock charts in '87<br />** \\"Dry County\\" from 'Keep The Faith' - It never quite reached the level of popularity I think it deserved, probably because of its length (nearly 10 minutes), but I personally think this is the most underrated single, maybe even song, the band has ever released<br />** \\"I Love This Town\\" from 'Lost Highway' - It was never released as a single, but I've heard it used in various promos/TV spots over the past few years, most notably for me by Major League Baseball<br /><br />The biggest problem isn't really a problem at all. I went to a Bon Jovi concert in New Jersey when he was on The Circle Tour, and he played about thirty songs (a massive set that lasted over three hours); yet when my friend and I were leaving the stadium, she was talking about some of the songs she wished the band had played. Well... the same thing goes for this album; this band has so many hits thatno matter how you pick and choose your favorites, something is going to be left off and somebody is going to be disappointed.<br />Now, personally, I thought \\"Blood On Blood\\" was a take it or leave it song. Of course I could, and probably will, be in the minority. But either way, it's a great problem to have when you actually have too many hits for a 2-disc set. I've always thought when you're releasing an album of songs already released before, you should fill up as much of the CD as possible. There's no logical reason why an even thirty songs couldn't have been used here. When you do a 'Greatest Hits', especially (as some reviewers have noted prior to me), an >\\"Ultimate\\"&lt; Greatest Hits, you should spare none of the essential cuts. This could very well be the album that teenagers are buying twenty years from now when they're first introduced to Bon Jovi's music. You don't want them to miss out on anything.<br /><br />Now, onto the new songs.<br />\\"What Do You Got\\" - A mid-tempo love song, classic Bon Jovi. It didn't really catch on with me 'til recently. I like it, but it's quite not in that \\"repeat\\" zone for me. 8/10<br /><br />\\"The More Things Change\\" - Sounds like something that would've fit very well onto 'The Circle' album. Kind of a retro-ed up modern rock song. Again, it didn't quite hit me as anything spectacular, but I've grown fond of it over a few listens. 8/10<br /><br />\\"This Is Love This Is Life\\" - This song struck me from the first listen. Great up-tempo song, great for concerts. I will even go as far as to say it's an anthem in the making. It's very, very vintage 80's Bon Jovi. I fell in love with it by the end of the first chorus. 9.5/10<br /><br />\\"No Apologies\\" - Very quirky song from a pretty polished band. I don't even know how to really describe it. It's a song that has momentum and finds its way on a creative pace and a great guitar solo from our good man, Richie. 8.5/10<br /><br />Bands like Bon Jovi last so long that by the time they're finally done doing their thing, they may have two or three different Greatest Hits albums. For all we know (and I hope this is the case), Jon and Richie could write another five albums and we'll see the \\"Ultimate Super Hits\\" Bon Jovi collection in 2025.<br />For now, this album has some imperfections, but it's still one of the most complete GH albums I've ever come across from a band whose career spans more than a decade. There's very little to complain about, at least from my perspective. My only gripes I made a point of on here (because everyone needs to hear both the pros and the cons), but what it boils down to is you're getting 28 of the best songs this band has written over a quarter of a century. This is where listeners first getting into Bon Jovi need to start.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />A-g to be disappointed.

0060555661|3.0|Haven't been able to read much of this book because the print is soo small.  Larger print would be great.  The concepts sound good, but it would take a very practiced eye to read it.  Unfortunately, Financial folks are often more concerned with the cost of printing a book than the readability of it for the regular person.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|One reviewer noted that \\"Splice\\" has more in common with the films of David Cronenberg than anything Vincenzo Natali has been involved with.  That's an understatement.  This would be Vincenzo Natali taking direct cues from David Cronenberg and Piero Pasolini on a darker day and giving birth, no pun intended, to this disgusting piece of trash.<br /><br />Adrien Brody plays Clive Nicoli--his character's appearance itself is enough to tell you \\"not a quality movie\\" (bleached red hair and corporate hipster wear, just not jiving with Brody's regular appearance)--a young scientist who believes that anything is okay to do in science, blaming those \\"ignorant fascists\\" (meaning Christians) who think that any caution in science is unacceptable.  Sarah Polley plays Elsa Kast, his live in girlfriend who feels the same way.<br /><br />In short what happens is this: these two psychologically compromised people end up creating what looks like Sinead O Connor with a slice in the top of it's head.  As a baby it looks kind of appealing, and that's the cruel ruse of the movie: it wants to warm you up to the idea of this kind of \\"science\\", and then turn you on your head and stomach for ever having cherished the creature or the characters.  Let's just say that some disgusting things happen between the three (one count of incest, one count of rape), and the whole thing is like black bile.<br /><br />This is not even shocking art in the sense of \\"breaking taboos\\", it is just unpleasant and gross.  Not recommended at all.

B00447G2T8|5.0|I listened this CD at first when it came out last October 28 in Japan, as usual for this type of bands, release dates come early than America, and even better, includes a bonus track that in this case is AWESOME, especially for the bass work, song name is \\"Faster we fall\\" and as I said is just an excellent track as are all the other ones.  I have been a helloween fan for many years and I can tell  you for sure ... this CD is unique, sound is fresh, heavier and faster than \\"gambling with the devil\\".  Helloween has become a band that keeps evolving in a way that keeps old-fans happy and also delivering excellent material for people new to the band or to the gender itself.  If you listen from start to finish this CD you will enjoy power metal at its finest.   The highlights of the CD could perfectly be the bass and drums work, these sound fresh with full inspiration, second, production and guitar work, a guitar work that can be only expected from these masters.  I am glad that helloween keeps delivering high-quality and high-creativity music, that in fact , themselves represents the highest bar for many other bands.  Go for it, I am sure YOU WILL NOT BE disappointed and most probably, if you are not yet a Helloween listener, you'll be ...

B003YCI1O8|5.0|Successfully mixing comedy and horror is a near-impossibility. There aren't many good comedy-horror films -- \\"Gremlins\\" and \\"Army of Darkness\\" come to mind. And, of course, the mother of them all, \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\". \\"Tremors\\" is another outstanding film to add to this list.<br /><br />What is particularly remarkable is that Ron Underwood, in his first job as director, nails it. Everything is... perfection. The timing, the tone, the pacing, are all models for this sort of film. It's as if he'd been directing all his life.<br /><br />The casting is good, too. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward make an interesting odd couple of handymen, with Ward about 20 years older than Bacon. Ward easily out-sexies Bacon, sauntering with widespread legs and swaying hips, as if he's just wandered in from a blue jeans commercial.<br /><br />Except for the excessive edge enhancement (the worst I've seen in any Blu-ray), the image quality is excellent. The film appears to have been shot full-frame, without an in-camera mask, and the widescreen Laserdisk version looked as if it had been cropped too closely (which seems to be a problem at Universal), with a decidedly \\"claustrophobic\\" quality to some scenes. This edition appears perfectly framed.<br /><br />TECHNICAL NOTE: The Blu-ray seems to be derived from the same source as the HD-DVD, with severe edge sharpening. This is particularly noticeable in the travelling matte shot in Burt's basement -- you can see a white line surrounding him. A few seconds later, the Gummers are on the roof, and there are white lines around /everything/. It's pathetic. (These aren't the only examples, just the worst ones.)<br /><br />Listen, Universal... I doubt most films need much (if any) sharpening. Certainly not /this/ much. If \\"The Searchers\\", a film more than 50 years old, can look breathtaking without sharpening, why is it needed for recent films? As far as I know, you can sharpen the image without introducing Gibbs artifacts. (You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you? Your transfer technicians merely locate the Sharpen knob and turn it all the way up to 11, without regard for the consequences.) This is typical of American companies -- they screw up good things so they'll appeal to the lowest common denominator of customer.I'm talking about, do you?

B003X73QA8|5.0|Upon first listen the Arcade Fire's fourth release The Suburbs is an album which in no way exceeds the expectations of its fans or for that matter any part of the independent music world, and yet that is the entire point. There is something lacking here that was present on previous releases, Funeral and especially the epically haunting Neon Bible. Extreme passion and angst. If Neon Bible at times feels like someone shouting in the down a cavernous and sometimes claustrophobic dimly lit church hallway than The Suburbs feels quite the opposite. In fact it has no feeling and it sounds to me that that is exactly the way the band wanted it.<br /><br />The attitude throughout the first half of the album and even parts of the second half is one where Win Butler, through clever lyrics and happy music, barely avoids complacency, sometimes even giving in to the nonsensical vain lifestyle that surrounds the characters he sings about. The title track is a perfect example of this. Its happy-go-lucky melody is almost too blissful to be true. The blissful melodies often employed in the songs suggests that suburbia is meant to be a place where a person can escape the world's problems and live in a sort of paradise yet, the lyrics of this song and the entire album speak of discontent in the suburban lifestyle.<br />The fact that The Suburbs in many ways has lifted the urgency out of the Arcade Fire's music shows that suburbia is a place where greed and complacency take root and eventually lead to confusion and at times madness. To even try to describe suburbia through music means the passion and angst must be sucked out of the music in order to give an accurate sonic picture of suburbia and that is exactly what makes the album exciting and different. Don't get me wrong there are songs that actually have a lot of passion and urgency to them.  Those songs, in the context of the album tend to sound grander and more urgent than ever.  For example the song `We used to wait' is a song soaked in nostalgia and longing for a time where people had to write letters to correspond to each other and that act of writing letters was more deliberate and required more patience than any form of communication we have today. The lyrics perfectly describe this dilemma:  Win sings `So I never wrote a letter/I never took my true heart/ I never wrote it down' and `It seems strange/ How we used to wait for letters to arrive/But what's stranger still/ Is how something so small can keep you alive'. `Ready to Start' and `Month of May' are foot stomping numbers that make you almost want to get up and dance. There is a disguised madness here that, by the final track, overtakes both the music and the lyrics. The reprise of the title track is an eerie take on the original, echoing the sentiment that underneath all of the superficial layers, suburbia is a really pretty creepy and disillusioning place.<br />It takes a lot to get into this album but once you do you'll be hooked especially if you grew up in a place that is considered suburbia. Like all Arcade Fire albums, this one is a grower and requires repeated listenings.<br /><br />I'd Give this 4.5  stars but we'll go with 5 because that is all Amazon allows us to do. Its definitely not as good as Neon Bible but I think its just as good as Funeral as an album. It definitely won't become a classic like Funeral did. In fact I am pretty sure this will become one the Arcade Fire's most underrated albums, much like Radiohead's Kid A was to Ok Computer.(though to be fair I am not comparing the content of AF albums to Radiohead. Of course Radiohead is more revolutionary as far as music goes)<br /><br />for more reviews like this one see [...]
B003ZD9DUC|1.0|Mad Max and Escape From New York are two titles I would consider essential to have in my BD collection, but I will not be buying them in their present state. Why, you ask? Let us do some simple science and maths:    Science in the sense of positing a fact: I watch all my discs on a 50\\" plasma television, and listen to them with a receiver that decodes 7.1 channel lossless soundtracks via the HDMI ports.    Hence, Blu-ray + DVD = NOT GETTING MY MONEY.    It really is that simple, MGM and anyone else who is contemplating force-feeding consumers what I now refer to as a holdback format. I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD. So when the UK Amazon offers Mad Max and Escape From New York without force-fed DVDs, guess who is getting my money?    DVD is dead. Face up to it. It died the day that BD spoke up and offered us the experience of progressive television.

The problem is that in this 2.5 minute preview, you see only about 10 seconds of the actual film. All the rest is credits and title cards. Who is the genius that posted that?  Probably the same people who post the LOOK INSIDE pages for books but only show blank pages, title pages and the index. I wish the folks at Amazon would put some thought into these things so their customers can see what they're buying.   I'm giving the film 4 stars on faith because I can't believe that Chaney would be anything but brilliant.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Sony went the right direction with this controller in that they maintained the core aspect of the Dualshock controller while making dramatic improvements. The Bluetooth is very long range as I once brought my controller to another room and turned the PS3 on from there. I have never had connections problems whatsoever. Since the six months that I have owned this I've only had to recharge it twice ad yet the battery doesn't stick out like a tumor, it's very VERY light! People complain that the trigger buttons are too slippery but in most games that I play the trigger button is used for something like grenades and I really like being able to just slide my finger down the trigger to release a grenade or something. I can see how it'd be a problem if I had to hold it down but I haven't had a game that required me to do that yet.    Point is, I don't think any third party controller can come close to have this controller offers. It's definitely the best Playstation controller to date.
0670021652|4.0|If I'd picked up \\"Committed\\" three years ago, I probably wouldn't have given it much thought. As it is, however, I read this book a few weeks after my own divorce was finalized, not to mention most of a year into a wonderful relationship myself. While I don't share Gilbert's revulsion toward marriage, many of the thoughts and ideas that have been bouncing around in my head were on these pages. Reading \\"Committed\\" was very much like sitting down with someone you've never met and discovering how much you share in common. Gilbert has a knack for tone, coming across in such a friendly way that I found it easy to overlook some of the weaker parts of the book (particularly the ending). I primarily liked \\"Committed\\" because it resonated with me at this point in my life, and am glad to have found it when I did.
0439023513|2.0|There were some very insightful negative reviews and I have to agree with most of them.  I loved the first two books and was so impressed by the author.  Unfortunately, the statement the author wanted to make became more focal than the story - and that's when the story died.  It was just pit in your stomach disappointing.  Such promise!!!  I want to write an alternate third book.
1439152780|5.0|I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher.<br /><br />I loved Kate Morton's book THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN so I was very excited when I got a galley of her newest book, THE DISTANT HOURS.  When a letter from 1941 finally arrives at its destination fifty years later, it has powerful repercussions for Edie Burchill, a young publisher in London.  Edie's mother opens the much-belated letter and is powerfully affected by it. She reveals to Edie that she had been evacuated to a castle called Milderhurst in the countryside during the war. Edie is very surprised to learn of this previously hidden episode in her mother's life.  She is even more surprised to learn that Milderhurst was the residence of the author of Raymond Blythe, the author of one her favorite books, THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE MUD MAN.  This book is a national treasure and no one has ever cracked the mystery of the true inspiration behind the story. When Edie is brought to Milderhurst by chance, she can't resist learning more about the place her mother had been exiled to and, in so doing, becomes drawn into the lives of the three elderly Blythe sisters that reside there still and the mysteries surrounding them.<br /><br />This is a very difficult book to describe. There is so much going on!  It is a bit of a chunkster at 670 pages but the story flew by as I could not put it down. The story moves back and forth between the present of 1992 to the war years. We see the events unfolding through multiple perspectives as we try to learn the truth about the hidden secrets of the Blythe sisters and the origins of the famous MUD MAN story. There is also the side story of Edie trying to understand her mother, Meredith, by delving into her past.  The book reveals a great deal about the often complicated relationships between parents and children and also between siblings. The book offers a literary mystery and reminded me a great deal of AS Byatt's POSSESSION and Diane Setterfield's THE THIRTEENTH TALE. All of the characters are interesting and the secrets and mysteries keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />I could not put this book down.  I loved it even more than THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN.  It has many of the elements of my favorite books--mystery, books, family drama and secrets, madness, passion, castles, romance and even some wartime drama.  Although I think the ending was successful, it felt a little abrupt to me.  I wish Morton hadn't hurried things up so much. However, it was a thoroughly entertaining read overall.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  HIGHLY recommended.  One of my favorites this year.  Fans of AS Byatt and Diane Setterfield and even Charlotte Bronte will find much to enjoy here. This makes a great winter read.are interesting and the secrets and mysteries keep you guessing until the end.     I could not put this book down.  I loved it even more than THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN.

B0041CGP02|1.0|I've been a fan of Bon Jovi since their first CD and lately, Bon Jovi has become more a business machine, than a rock band who cares about the music and their fans. Just watch \\"The Circle\\" DVD and even Jon admits that he is now the \\"CEO of a multi-million dollar corporation\\". Whatever happened to \\"Me I'm just a singer in a long haired rock and roll band\\"? From premium concert tickets that are not being made available to the regular Joe anymore because they are now \\"VIP Packages\\" available for more $, to a terrible marketing ploy to re-release all the CD's as \\"Special Editions\\" to force fans to spend more money for what essentially are the same releases. Hey Jon, wanna make a Special Edition of old CD's, how about releasing them as live CD's from track 1 to the last with recordings from that era? Just give us something different if you're going to milk us anyway. This Greatest Hits is no different. It's just an expanded copy of \\"Crossroads\\". Throw in 4 new mediocre songs (which you can't get all 4 unless you buy the \\"Ultimate\\" collection) to make us feel better about our purchase. I know that music is a business, but there is such a thing as milking the fanbase too much. I'll probably get a lot of crap from other Bon Jovi fans, but I'm just getting tired of us fans spending our hard earned cash on overly recycled materials.
B003XKAZK4|4.0|I think is just to close to the another one, but it's ok.  The 3rd cd... i'm not sure, i would prefered a cd with the videos or remixes or something like that... but it's ok.  I love robbie so i bought this cd to keep in the car.  AND WHY THE BOOKLET HAVEN'T THE LYRICS?   ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT BUY A NEW CD IS: rip the plastic paper and see the booklet.. forget the cd... THE BOOKLET!!!!!!!!!!   ok, i'll calm down.... i forgive you robbie just cause i enjoy the songs    AND... AND  the song are censored.. the damn BEEP are in the songs... so please i need hear the song in the original way! with bad words and all these things!

B00428CPUY|2.0|In his younger years Clapton would walk away from groups that were just breaking or just becoming successful.<br />Yardbirds,John Mayall, Cream, Blind Faith to name a few. If there was even a hint of something getting stale - EC was OUT!<br />Then there was the early 70's  - Rainbow Concert, EC was here, One in every crowd, etc - our hero just treading water album after album. After album after album. Some better than others but all mostly the same 'ole same 'ole.<br />A little spark in the 80's and some great albums up till the late 90's - But then.....Reptile? Back Home?And now: Clapton??<br />Ladies and Gentlemen...please!<br />The only thing we had left were the Crossroads shows where our hero would show that he can still do it!! And do it<br />great with other #1 guitarists too! Crossroads #1 and #2 were both excellent but now we have edition #3....and its starting to stink again....same 'ole same 'ole again and again - I cringe at the thought of Crossroads #4 next year.<br />I can either keep buying the latest Croassroads DVD's or simply watch the old ones over and over - there is no difference.<br />Try Netflix first and then decide for yourself.
B002KAJ0AO|1.0|The Backstreet Boys WERE headed in the right direction.  From Black and Blue on, the albums kept getting stronger and stronger.  \\"Never Gone\\" is where the Boys peaked.  That was a masterpiece of an album.  \\"Unbreakable\\" was a little bit of a letdown, but it was still showing the bands progression towards maturation.  However, \\"This is Us\\" is a complete debacle.  It's a major step backwards, and it's a radical departure from what has worked for the BSB in the past.<br /><br />\\"This is Us\\" is mostly an experimental dance album, completely abandoning the pop sound, which made them immensely popular.  It's no wonder this album is the first one in BSB history not to get a song on the Top 100 Charts.  There isn't one song worthy of even being on a Top 1,000 chart (if one existed).  This album is truly a disaster, and I'm sure the band realizes it, and hopefully, someone was fired for letting this album be recorded.  Harsh, but true.  There's really nothing good you can say about this album, except that the next one (if there is one) can't possibly get any worse!  It's only up from here!<br /><br />For anyone who gave this album 5 stars, shame on you.  Seriously.  Shame on you.<br /><br />P.S. You can give me all of the \\"unhelpful\\" votes you want.  That doesn't change the fact that this album is awful.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|The movie started very slow and I found myself getting bored, however, things did pick up just in time before I started to trash it. I also felt the camera work felt a big 'gimmicky' early on. The split screens, etc. felt a bit cheap and distracting.    Ellen Burstyn, the mother, did a remarkable job...great,great acting all around. However I didn't vibe with the setup though..with the exception of the mother, all the Black characters seemed to to be 'vicious, evil ones' to bring drugs and destruction into the \\"innocent and wholesome\\" caucasian's lives..which I found a wee bit absurd.     Good job!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I won't deign to review the underlying story here. Instead, I'd just like to comment on the Kindle edition. While I enjoyed the story, there were so many errors in the transcription that clearly no editor reviewed the output from whatever OCR program they used to produce the electronic text. Each one was distracting, and I tried to deduce what some odd word was supposed to be. You can't go more than about 3 pages without hitting an obvious error.<br /><br />So, I would give the story content 4 stars (it's not, after all, Tolkien), but I'm deducting a star for the Kindle transcription. Still recommended, but beware the typos.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Victory of the Daleks and the Silurian two parter aside, this is far and away the best season of Doctor Who yet. The writing has improved ten fold over all (excluding the aforementioned episodes) which is no surprise as Stephen Moffat (Blink, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead) has taken over as lead writer.  Matt Smith plays the eleventh incarnation of the doctor. He's energetic, though brash and a bit more outwardly alien then Tennant's Doctor. It's a change of pace as so much has changed but it retains what has made Doctor Who such a polarizing show over the years. You'll laugh (The Lodger.) You'll cry (Vincent and the Doctor.) You'll get goosebumps (The Eleventh Hour, The Big Bang.) Don't wait on this.
1932100660|5.0|I was orignally from China and have been living in Australia for almost 13 years. I have been feeling so lucky that I read this great book three years ago.    With my life experience in two countries, I would like to say that Dr Campbell's research is so profundly important for us to keep a clear mind about what we eat everyday to keep healthy.    It's easy to follow up his suggestions in the book. I am still eat some fish once in a while, but with the knowledge in the book, I know clearly how to keep control of my weight. If we eat right, we actually don't need to worry about how to get rid of extra weight at all.    Do your own favour to buy and read this great and important book. Not matter it's for health or beauty purpose.
B00377V6J2|5.0|By 'Rebel' Rod Ames<br /><br />Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan - In Session (Stax Records) is sort of a re-release of the 1983 audio disc. However, the DVD includes three performances previously unavailable - \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", the landmark title track from Albert King's biggest Stax release, written by William Bell and Booker T. Jones; Stevie Ray's \\"Texas Flood\\", the Davis penned title track of Vaughan's immortal debut album; and \\"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\\", made famous by Louis Jordan and later, Ray Charles.<br /><br />The entire event was taken from the Canadian series In Session. The magic occurred on December 6, 1983 and man-oh- man is it ever an unbelievable experience. Not only do we get to see two masters bend strings and literally sweat the blues, we get to see and hear them banter back and forth. There was a mutual respect for sure, but on Stevie's part, it was pure unadulterated idolization. This is the man he had placed upon the highest possible pedestal, and here he is, performing with him upon that very same pedestal.<br /><br />I'm sure, by the time they finished the session, there was an absolute mutual adoration.  At one point Mr. King tells Stevie after they finish playing \\"Stormy Monday\\", they reminisce about the first time they met at the Austin Coliseum in Austin, Texas, Mr. King says after hearing  Stevie for the first time, \\"you got the makings of a good fiddler\\". Hysterical banter for sure. It was obvious the two masters of blues guitar were enjoying each other's company immensely.<br /><br />Immediately afterwards, they blast into \\"Pride and Joy\\" which is incredibly mesmerizing, for lack of a better word to describe it. Here we have Stevie's throaty vocals and electric guitar, Albert King on electric guitar, with Tony Llorens accompanying on the piano and organ, Bus Thornton playing bass, and Michael Llorens binding it all together with his skillfully rhythmic drums.<br /><br />Other tunes on the audio CD are \\"Ask Me No Questions\\", \\"Blues at Sunrise\\", \\"Overall Junction\\", \\"Matchbox Blues\\", and \\"Don't Lie to Me\\". There is conversation between the two before each song throughout the CD, which adds to the recording, making it an extremely intimate experience.<br /><br />The two never performed together again. Sadly, in 1990 Stevie Ray, after leaving a concert via helicopter, crashed into a foggy hillside. Everyone, including Stevie was killed. Albert King died two years later of a heart attack. The fact that this was a one-time deal makes this recording even more important. It is an amazing piece of musical history.<br /><br />The DVD that accompanies the audio CD is incredible. Now, not only do you hear it all, we get to see it as well. There is just something about seeing these two masters at their craft. Moreover, seeing these two is truly candy for not only the ears but for the eyes. My eyes are constantly in disbelief at what they are seeing, but the ears prove that it is all very real indeed.<br /><br />The never before seen video footage here does much more than compliment the package. It completes and enhances it all. The tunes on the DVD, besides the fore mentioned, \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", \\"Texas Flood\\", and \\"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\\", are \\"Stormy Monday\\", \\"Don't Lie to Me\\", and \\"Pride and Joy\\".<br /><br />This package is not to be missed and will be released on Stax Records this coming November 9th.all Junction\\", \\"Matchbox Blues\\", and \\"Don't Lie to Me\\".

0767817478|5.0|really dont know what else can be ordered from a movie, entertaining, intelligent script, decent special effects, exciting .... or is that more demand? is not a film designed to win Academy Awards, is a movie to entertain. Those who criticize it so bitterly are nothing but a bunch of stupid.
1441407871|1.0|Several years ago when I first read Siddhartha I did so as part of a search for understanding the elements of Eastern spirituality. The book was mentioned in a surprising collection of other authors during that zeitgeist which is how I lost my original copy: borrowed and not returned! The recent replacement copy of Siddhartha sent to me through Amazon,however seemed to be an unedited and oddly formatted (margins inconsistent)piece of literature. There were grammar errors and odd translations that distracted from the text. A German word had been put in English form with parentheses and a question mark, for example. There was no publication date that could trace the authorship. Was this a bootleg?

1401309666|4.0|The Long Tail proposes a shift in paradigms. Along his work the author claims that technology has made it possible to shift from a scarcity mindset to an abundance one. The paradigm revolution lies in the limitless CHOICE that the modern consumer has. Technology has made it possible that companies (mostly online retailers) offer an infinite amount of products in a profitable manner.    The reason behind this is zero shelf and distribution costs. Computers and internet have made it possible to offer entire collections of digital products without having to spend fortunes in warehouses and shelf space. The variety of songs available in an online music store greatly outnumbers that of any record store which has to fight scarcity. The record store must choose which limited number of albums to carry; each one competes for the limited shelf space available. The record store needs hit albums to survive, the online store doesn't. Hit albums sell good money; non-hits sell a modest or minimal amount of copies, but there are so many of them that they quickly add up and become an important fraction of the total revenue.        The shift in consumer choice does not only mean cheaper products and more options. The long tail principle has ramifications in culture as well. Now that distribution and information bottlenecks have been overcome, communities are less based on geography but more on affinity of tastes and ideas.  This in turn gives a chance to niche products to thrive and become an important part of the market. Nevertheless, if there are not filters and recommendations to help people to navigate through the limitless choices available to them, this new paradigm will not translate into a bigger and more realistic demand (the author states that once the logistics impairments are overcome and that all the possible choices are out, the true shape of the demand curve will reveal). Only appropriate connections will drive business from hits to niches. Also, democratization in production and distribution means is necessary to lengthen and fatten the tail. Technology has made this possible in some sectors such as music; garage bands can now record themselves at home and reach millions through the internet uploading their generated contents to sites such as YouTube.         A Final word on the mechanics of the book, the concepts introduced are interesting and backed up by a thoughtful research and observation of the phenomenon; nevertheless, such as this review the author tends to be repetitive on the ideas and drones on. The first chapters develop the idea while the last ones deal more with examples on different industries. Still this is a book worth reading, in addition it also articulates with other books such as \\"The Future of Competition\\", \\"The World is Flat\\", and \\"Made to Stick\\". Along the book there are references to the role of consumers as co-Creators of value with the enterprises. There are references to the increasingly weaker role of geography in the shaping of our cultural and economical landscape as well as the role of word of mouth into connecting people and making ideas or products popular.
0399230033|5.0|My daughter is 17 months, and she already loves this book, hence the five stars. But, I just am not sure that she totally understands what is going on in the story. Concepts like animals in cages, keys unlocking doors, and the animals sneaking into the zookeeper's house (depicted with great charm and humor) might be lost on her. But maybe I am doubting where I shouldn't, because she still loves it. But there is a page that illustrates the zookeeper's wife's shock when she hears all the animals who snuck in her house wish her goodnight. She had just turned out the light, when the next page is black and filled with \\"goodnight\\" dialogue bubbles--this is great because you can make all kinds of funny voices saying \\"goodnight.\\" Then the next page is also black with just two wide eyes in the middle to illustrate the zookeeper's wife's shock. It's obvious to me that she is sitting up in bed with shock. It's funny and super cute, but I am not sure if my little girl gets the convention.     Like I said, I totally give this book five stars, and I am sure that we will read it again and again. My daugher sees the cover and grabs the book and says \\"book, book, sit, sit.\\" She is way into it. Totally recommend....maybe better for slightly older child though.......

He clearly is passionate aobut music and loves to sing, play and write. Overall, this is a GREAT album!  I am quite a pop music fan, especially boy bands (despite my almost 30 years).   I can't wait to hear more from Nick!

B003R4ZMNQ|2.0|I loved Moonlight and Alex O'Loughlin, and I think Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim are hot. But since the beginning I thought the script was really poorly written and amateurish and the characters were unconvincing. But I stuck with it... till today. I had to turn off the TV in the middle of the show because I simply couldn't take the whiny over-acting of Scott Caan anymore. He may get away with it if he's good looking, but he's short, has bad hair and bad posture and zero charisma. So bye-bye Hawaii.
B0041CGP02|3.0|\\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\" is what Bon Jovi should ALWAYS sound like. The 80's were the best era of the band and everything they wrote with Desmond Child is what defined their signature sound. When you think of Bon Jovi, I would assume that the first song that comes to one's mind is \\"Living On A Prayer\\" or \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\". When you want to imitate Bon Jovi, I assume one always has the reflex to go like this: \\"Woa-Oh\\" or \\"Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah...\\". That is Desmond Child for you. As soon as they went away from that song writer, they lost their magic touch. They do come back to him from time to time but it's just not the same. Christ! Even the demos cut for \\"Slippery When Wet\\" or \\"New Jersey\\" that didn't make the CD's were pure gems! Has anyone ever heard \\"Love Is War\\", \\"Edge Of A Broken Heart\\", \\"River Of Love\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Backdoor To Heaven\\" or \\"Love Hurts\\"? When will the band finally put out the double CD of \\"New Jersey\\", the way it was supposed to be?     I understand that a band needs to \\"grow\\" and \\"explore\\" new territories. I want that from Madonna, Sting and U2. I don't want it from AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Bryan Adams and... Bon Jovi. Some bands, you don't want them to change. I  will always follow Bon Jovi and I have all their CD's. Some of the new songs, I adore. But the Bon Jovi that I truly love is the one from the 80's (with Desmond Child).     If they can come back to that sound, it would be just great. Proof of that is when they put out \\"It's My Life\\" which was definitely a come back to that Desmond Child-80's kind of sound. And everybody loved it! I have a feeling that the same thing will happen more or less with \\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\", one of the four new songs of this compilation.     One thing we must admit is that this band is talented. And they are very aware of their talent. Cause they always compose about fifty songs for each of their albums and always chose only 12 or so. The big box they put out with all their demosdoesn't even have some of my favorite songs! What about \\"Cadillac Man\\"? Or the songs mentioned before from the lost sessions of \\"New Jersey\\"? Or the lost sessions of the first CD? I'm thinking of songs like \\"What D'ya Want\\" or \\"Talking In Your Sleep\\".     No, this new compilation is not their \\"ultimate\\" greatest hits. But it will please the \\"not-so-big-fans\\" that just want their commercial hits. That's for sure.     Let's just hope that they build around \\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\" for the future... and go back to Desmond Child. But the Desmond Child of the 80's.
1935251740|5.0|I am a fan of Dr. Lanza's blogs on the Huffington Post and decided to buy his book.  I was not disappointed.  What a wonderful book, not only for the groundbreaking idea he posits but also for his beautiful prose style of writing.  How refreshing it is to encounter a scientist unafraid to challenge our perceptions and go against the tide bringing us a fresh perspective on old puzzles.  Indeed it answers many conundrums that Physicists have traditionally ignored.  Why indeed are the laws of nature balanced so precisely to afford our existence?  Is biocentrism the answer that has been tugging at the edges of our understanding for so long?  Who can deny that Dr. Lanza may be on to something here?
0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl comprises of two parts. The first is his own harrowing account of the time he spent in four concentration camps under Nazi occupation during WWII. The second is his introduction to logotherapy, which is his own psychological method for helping others cope with pain, guilt and death. It is the first part of the book, from his own perspective entitled 'Experiences in a Concentration Camp', that is the true heart of his story.<br /><br />His retelling of the concentration camp experience is so gripping because it is, for lack of a better word, so simple. So much inhumanity of the most heinous kind was endured, and yet some of these men and women clung to something deep within themselves and managed to survive. And not everyone had a choice. Some lives were taken without a chance of survival.<br /><br />The introduction to logotherapy is much more academic, but it's summary is basic: From within and outside of yourself, find that which gives your life meaning and focus upon that to carry you through your pain and suffering. This wisdom has been echoed by many, and putting it into practice may take considerable time and effort, but it is the truest form of living I have ever encountered.
0439023521|4.0|Worth reading. Well written. Plot is strong. Characters have depth. And a book with maybe 1 typo. So many books I read nowadays have so many typos and grammatical errors. It's like copy editors don't exist. Not with this book.

0316069485|4.0|As always I enjoyed the mystery and twists and turns of the plot. I enjoyed the court room scenes very much and the strategy behind the prosecutor.  I wish there had been more from Harry Bosch- it was a little confusing reading him in the second person and Mr Haller in the first person.  I haven't read many of those novels- I usually stick with Harry Bosch.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Easy, heartfelt read. It was hard for me to put down, and I have recommended this book to all my friends. Some parts really made me question the human race. So well written, and the ending was an unexpected joy. I think I reread the ending over and over. Highly recommend this feel-good book.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|While Iron Man 2 is nowhere as good as the first one (my favorite movie), it is still a very fun movie. The blu-ray is a great deal too and the picture is really incredible. The special features also make the blu-ray a much better buy than the normal one.
B004132I20|5.0|Within the first 10 minutes of Sherlock, you are hooked.  Not since shows like The West Wing has the writing of a show been so refreshing and incredible.  The dialogue flows like music and the dry British humor pops in and out of the scenes with rapid fire, so you really have to be paying attention to catch it...much like Holmes.  After just watching the Pilot, I was already a fan and it left me wanting more.  The writers are taking the books and stories from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles original works and tweaking them for the 21st century.  Holmes is a brilliant and methodical eccentric who is seemingly alone in the world due to his incredible mind.  He often pities the rest of us for not being able to keep up.  Watson is a \\"wounded\\" veteran from Afghanistan who longs to be back in the heat of battle.  The show will twist and turn on you, surprise you with its dialogue and direction, and keep you bolted to your screen with outstanding performances all the way around.
B0040QYROA|5.0|When I first saw the COMPLETE METROPOLIS, I was amazed!  I am still blown away!  Like many of you, I had seen the original edited version, and later Moroder's 1980's version. The original versions were dull and confusing (although visually interesting) because of the merciless over-editing made after its first release.  The Moroder version was interesting in that, apart from the 1980s score, it was while viewing this version that I first learned about just how many scenes were lost to history;  these edited scenes were destroyed during WWII and were reincorporated into Moroder's version via \\"stills\\" and extensive sub-titles -- this was annoying and still confusing, and not totally convincing in some scenes.<br /><br />The complete version incorporates the recently discovered 30 minutes of film found in Argentina!  So you can see this movie sooner, let me be brief.<br /><br />If you like the original version - you will love this new complete version ten times more. But if, like me, you were disappointed and/or confused by the disjointed scenes and experienced head-scratching moments when you said to yourself things like: \\"Why the hell does the Maria/Maschinenmensch become a burlesque dancer at Yoshiwara's?\\" Well, this version finally explains it!  Also, I was never quite sure who was the biggest bad guy in the film:  Rotwang?  Fredersen? Der Maschinenmensch? Or someone else, like Fredersen's spy?  Who is to blame for the final destruction of Metropolis?  With this release, its now clear.  Even the minor characters are complete three dimensional characters, not silly caricatures as in edited versions.  Fully explored and realized is the recurring theme of the Maschinenmensch as the \\"Whore of Babylon\\", and how this is interwoven with the Seven Deadly Sins dream sequence.  These are things I totally missed in early versions.<br /><br />My rating for the edited versions, 2 or 3 stars, maybe; the \\"Complete Metropolis\\" version... 5 stars - EASY!  Often called the greatest film of the era, now I can finally see why!film of the era, now I can finally see why!
B001EN71CW|4.0|You already know that this is one of the most awesome, unique shows ever made. The blu-ray picture quality is far superior to DVD, but not as razor-sharp as other blu-ray releases, like, say Serenity. There is a noticeable distinction between shots without special effects and those with. All of the CGI seem to be created in standard definition. The sound quality, featuring DTS, is superb.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|Get it through your heads publishers and Amazon.  eBooks are too expensive.  $15 for an ebook that's 430 pages.  No way.  I'll ALMOST pay $19.99 for Follett's new book as it at least is ~1000 pages (I won't but ALMOST).  Pricing sucks and until you get it back to $9.99 people are not going to fully adopt this technology that will let Amazon put B&N away once and for all.
142311339X|4.0|I totally enjoyed the Percy Jackson series, Rick Riodan really writes some fun characters and weaves together a fun interesting world of Greek mythology.<br /><br />When I found out he was doing a \\"Camp Half Blood\\" series I was both excited and worried.  Excited because I was sad to see the end of The Olympians series and wanted more Percy and demi-gods and mythology.  Worried because where would we go?  I mean PErcy won all was safe, would it be a hokey ploy to drag out a great character?<br /><br />OHH NOO hokey Ploy here.  While I figured out where this was heading with Rick's new twist here, I was not upset at it being predictable but elated that he spiced it up and added a fantastic angle! New characters as likeable as the old mixed with old favorites, this is a GREAT beginning to the next chapter of our favorite demi-gods.  I can not wait for the next books!

0393072231|5.0|I picked this book up as I read Lewis' Liar's Poker and I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style. In compairing this to Liar's Poker I would say it was not quite as funny but overall much more thought proviking and content driven. Lewis sticks to a character driven retelling of the events which makes these financial markets much easier to digest. However, it seemed more so that Lewis had conclusion that he wanted to lead the reader to opposed to Liar's Poker seemed to be a peek inside of wall street from an outsider's eyes. Either way, this book is smart and fun to read at the same time. I read it in 2 sittings and many thoughts have stayed with me. Despite the rather complicated subject matter, I would recommend this book to anyone, not just people who are familiar with financial markets. Lewis does a great job of making complicated financial instruments easy to understand. Even if you don't understand them, it really should not impact your ability to enjoy the story.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I heard about this show through NSFW, a podcast, on the TWIT.TV network. I've been looking forward to it since I heard about it and after watching the first show I have been really impressed. The first episode has to spend a good amount of time setting up the how and why of zombies. The normal if you shoot them in the head they are dead and other story details. They do a fabulous job of creating a rich scene to see details in. Watching the first episode a second time allowed me to see some cool details I originally missed.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more episodes and I've been impressed with the massive scenery that has been created for the scenes (or maybe its computer generated, I cannot tell if it is). Either way, I'm looking forward to the next episode when I get Rookered. You should get Rooker rocked too by Michael Rooker. Fabulous Actor.<br /><br />In addition, I wish people would review the show and not their bad internet connection. Those 1 or 2 stars really aren't deserved by the show. If you are having problems with viewing the shows then talk to Amazon Support instead of giving a poor rating to a show (or any product for that matter) that cannot control your computer, the internet or amazon's video.
0553805371|2.0|This book should really have been titled \\"The ILLUSION of a Grand Design\\", based on the authors' overt attempts at defending their atheistic beliefs.  It has always struck me how some scientists have the arrogance to think that somehow their science can explain away God, when God, by definition transcends science (any definition of God involvng particle physics and quantum fields wouldn't be God in most people's book).  And then to have the arrogance to say, as these authors do, that \\"philosophy is dead\\".  Let's think about what that means:  all discussions about personal meaning, fullfillment, justice, purpose, good and evil, etc, are pointless?  In other words, all that really matters is what the authors consider to be a pointless, Godless, universe?  Does this give Hawking solace in his physical suffering?  I am not saying I want him (or me) to believe in a God just because it makes him feel better.  The fact is nobody really knows if there is a God or not, although some people are awefully convinced of it based on personal experience.  I am just saying no person, speaking as a scientist, can flat out say there is no god, because, as I mentioned, the notion of God transcends science.  I am a scientist, and huge proponent of the scientific method, but science just explains particles and fields at its most basic level.  It can not explain how consciousness (or \\"spirit\\" if you like) arises from inert chemicals.  It also can not explain a lot of other things, like why there is something rather than nothing, and why \\"this\\" something.  It can't even explain why the universe is accelerating in its expansion or what it's ultimate fate will be.  In fact, theoretical physics hasn't been able to explain a whole lot in the last 15 or so years.  String theory has the potential, we're told, to provide a quantum theory of gravity.  But what physical constants have ever been derived from string theory?  And what's interesting in this book is that prominent physicists like Hawking now finally admit that there probably is no single, unifying theory of physics... just a \\"family\\" of theories that only work well in their own realm or other slightly overlapping realms.  What kind of theory is that, except for an approximate one... and if it's approximate is it really a theory?  If we said mass/energy is approximately conserved, would that be a theory?  Also in this book the authors seem to continually trip over their own semantics and double-talk, making statements like \\"there is no definitive, observer independent past\\", but go on to talk about the 13.7 billion years of universal evolution since the big bang as if it's as real as Lincoln's Assassination.  I think physicists are having a tough time letting go of there materialistic heritage in light of quantum discoveries that are showing the universe out there is really more like a state of 'potentia', only to become as real as real can be in the human mind, or a collection of human minds.
1400049628|1.0|This book tried too hard. This is a subject that should be easy to write about given the plethora of movies, books, urban legend, etc. material available. The tone was different (that giving it 1 star for failed originality) and thats about it. The author tried so hard to be funny by not being funny that it never was FUNNY.<br />On the outside and only given a precursory glance I thought the book would be great, I hoped it would be a fun read during my flight, I thought it would be the great satire of survivalism sub-culture. Alas, it was god-awful. Thats it. You can pretend it was hilarious, you can talk about how funny the writing style is for the given subject, you can say what you will but nothing changes the fact that this book is horribly boring, slow, dumb, uncreative (its ZOMBIES after all, how can you be uncreative when the subject matter is so wide open?), and of all things poorly researched!<br />It's satire of the Survivalist sub-culture, satire means you have a good working knowledge of the actual subject. This book had no working knowledge of survivalism. I really wanted to like this book and I can't even donate it. I think I will use it for toilet paper and to start my fires next time I am camping...
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|First things first - let's face it, the sequels to the original (and riveting) Predator with AH-nold have been massively disappointing, and made the 'predator franchise' concept something of an artistic bad joke.  Not anymore - this one might the very best of the group, even compared with the original.  OK, some of the violence is a bit gruesome at times, but overall, they did a good job of making things exciting without making you feel like you wanted to puke and run out of the theater.  Fantastic acting and ending.  Even people who are not sci-fi fans might enjoy this one.  Blu-ray is the only way to watch however.
144174746X|3.0|I've been looking forward to this novel for months.  I am very disappointed.  The plot is weak and close to boring.  The supporting characters, aside from one, are weak and uninteresting.  I am very unhappy with the end of the novel.  All the prior Vorkosigan novels are so alive, energetic, vibrant, I wonder what happened here.
0765348276|4.0|Science fiction in literature could be in better shape these days. When I walk through my local Borders, all I see crowding the Sci-fi/Fantasy section is, well, fantasy for the most part, followed closely by Star Wars books and nearly half a shelf dedicated to Robert Heinlein. It's hard to be a sci-fi fan these days; what does it say when we have to look to authors from two generations ago to get our fix?<br /><br />That's why I was so excited when I started reading OLD MAN'S WAR. John Scalzi knows what good sci-fi is, and he knows how to write good sci-fi. He presents a universe (or several) that's easy to get into, and easy to get lost in.<br /><br />John Perry is a seventy-five-year-old who's decided that he's seen all that he needs to see of Earth, and joins the mysterious Colonial Defense Forces as a raw recruit in their military. What good would a senior citizen with no combat training do in an intergalactic war? Not even John knows, even as he's declared legally dead and shipped offworld to worlds unknown.<br /><br />But once he arrives at the warzone, he finds himself with a new combat-able body and a timetable of ten years to survive one of the costliest wars humanity has ever participated in. A war where you might be fighting a different species of enemy every other week and, what's worse, have no idea how to kill them.<br /><br />What I loved so much about this book was the mystery, because for almost half of the story, you have no idea what John and his associates have gotten themselves into. You're along for the ride, just as John is, through the nervewracking ride across the galaxy, \\"the change,\\" basic training, and beyond. The action is handled with a light touch; you'll be able to get an image of what's going on, but there is no insane attention to detail in that regard.<br /><br />And that's another thing I liked: the minimalist way Scalzi has gone about things. Good science-fiction can be a difficult thing to get right. Some write it too abstractly, and some write hard sci-fi to the point where you almost need a degree in astrophysics just to understand simple character banter. As one of Scalzi's characters would say, sometimes I just don't have the math. This is why I was so glad that OLD MAN'S WAR is written with a grace that provides a good story first, science-fiction as a supplement, and hard sci-fi for people who want to dig a little deeper.<br /><br />But, oddly enough, the minimalist style is also a reason I took issue with the book. Now, Scalzi won't talk down to you, but his methods for explaining the science behind his universe are a little backhanded at times. The characters understand the science, but the reader doesn't, so most times you'll have a random character profess his ignorance so that one of the main characters can go about explaining everything. It wasn't too fun finding myself identifying with the dumbest guy on the spaceship for those few instances.<br /><br />This is also a short book with a minimalist style and a lot of characters. Since there is a war on, characters do die, but I get the feeling that they were supposed to be more impactful moments than they turned out to be. You never really get a chance to know anyone until the end of the book, and some of the characters that I did get to like died somewhere off-screen. Didn't much care for that.<br /><br />Getting back to the positive, I did love John Perry's adventure at galaxy's end. It was the perfect merger of originality and celebration of classic sci-fi. The story brings with it the beauty of the universal unknowns, very much in the passionate way the late Carl Sagan talked about them. It's also a book that asks a lot of questions: Are we really destined to reach Alpha Centauri as a warbringing people? Is winning a war worth losing a bit of our hard-earned humanity? Is it easy being green?<br /><br />OLD MAN'S WAR is the story of an afterlife where there are decidedly few angels waiting to greet you. I was engaged the entire way through and eagerly await the sequel to arrive in the mail. Whenever I had to recommend a sci-fi book to a newcomer to the genre, I'd always hand over a copy of ENDER'S GAME, but lately that's been very, very hard for me to do. John Scalzi's given me a new book to pass along, and I really can't thank him enough for that.ver I had to recommend a sci-fi book to a newcomer to the genre, I'd always hand over a copy of ENDER'S GAME, but lately that's been very, very hard for me to do.

0439023491|5.0|I was super skeptical that Catching Fire would be able to live up to The Hunger Games. How the heck can you go on from that? But Suzanne Collins did. No, it's not quite as awesome as The Hunger Games, but mostly because you don't have all the shock and discovery that comes along with the first book.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away because I think this book is best enjoyed when you don't know the whole premise ahead of time. But I'l just say that what happens in Catching Fire is something you could never imagine upon the end of The Hunger Games. And it will keep you on the edge of your seat just as much.<br /><br />Make sure you read it when you have a little extra time. I had to stay up until 4 a.m. finishing this book because I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what happens to Katniss!

B003NWS5AO|2.0|After the wonderful and increasingly interesting Might Rearranger, I have to say this outing has been a let down for me. I know that a lot of folks are writing very positive reviews here. I'm just not hearing it. I find much of the work anti-climactic and somewhat aimless. The songs just sort of drag on in many cases. I find myself rooting for him and waiting for a clever turn around phrase or an interesting bridge or something to that end but it simply does not deliver. Many may be looking for a Led Zeppelin thing I suppose, but RP's solo work has always been a calculated departure from that and in many cases wonderful. Sorry folks, I just can't get behind this one. I would recommend Might Rearranger and in fact, I think its his most promising work since the mid 80's but then again, I also thought The Honeydrippers were awesome and I know a whole lot of people that hated it so, I may be the wrong guy to ask. I respectfully bow out in this release. RP is brilliant..a legend but it's simply not for me.
1439152780|5.0|Why is it that books that you love the most are the hardest to describe? I sat in front of my laptop for more than a hour , after I had finished reading the book and yet was unable to formulate a word other than \\"WOW!\\".<br /><br />Kate Morton is one of my top 5 favorite authors. I loved her other 2 books and I devoured the 600 plus pages of this book in less than one day.I was incapable of sleeping - the story and the characters pulled me in so deep that sleep was really the last thought I had.<br /><br />I had been awaiting this book more than any other book this year. The wait has been more than worth it.<br /><br />There is such a haunting quality to this book which makes it one that you cannot forget easily.There were sentences and whole paragraphs that still resonate in my ears.Kate Morton's beautiful writing is one of the major reasons why I am such a big fan of hers.Her lyrical prose will stay with you. I can actually quote lines from this book (something I thought I was not capable of)- such was the writing.<br /><br />The setting , a gothic castle, is a character in itself. Such is the author's writing that the castle seems as alive as its occupants.In its veins, runs the secrets from long ago.Kate Morton's breathtaking description of the castle will make you feel as if you are there.Her descriptions are so evocative, so beautiful that it leaves you wanting for more.<br /><br />Entwined with the suspense element is a heart-wrenching story of three sisters that won't fail to move you.The sisters and their story will break your heart. I felt their pain, their fears . Imagine being a prisoner in your own home with no dreams or hope for a future. I could feel the castle walls binding them, suffocating them.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I tried to prepare myself for the final shocking conclusion -as the secrets are revealed.Yet I was completely taken aback by the ending which was a disquieting one.<br /><br />The story's movement between the past and the present is smooth and beautifully done.As each chapter unfolds, we get to know more about the past. Slowly, we are able to piece together the parts to form a complete picture. As secret after secret unravels, years of secrets,betrayal, heartbreaks, tragedies, will shock you. This dark and haunting story will unnerve you and yet won't fail to touch you.<br /><br />There are certain chilling moments, I shuddered at some points. Its not something very in your face..its something lying just beneath the surface..something not visible.. that creeps you out.<br /><br />Even after an astounding ending ,I still felt as if there were still things left to the reader to decipher and interpret - the castle had still not revealed all its secrets.<br /><br />The castle, the sisters, their tragic story - they will linger with you , long after you have read the last page.<br /><br />The Distant Hours is a perfect read for a rainy night. It has all the makings of a prefect gothic novel- family secrets, an old castle, mysterious deaths, a letter from long ago and madness running through a family .<br /><br />Even though this is a huge book , I wanted more pages to miraculously appear. Its one of those books which made me want to read on and on.<br /><br />I think I am a Kate Morton fanatic for life now. This masterpiece of a book has made me very sure that no matter how much I have to wait for her next book, it will be definitely worth it.Its beacause of books like these that I love reading.<br /><br />Favorite Quote: There were so many , but if I have to choose one, it would be-<br />\\"The ancient walls sing the distant hours..\\"<br />Somehow this one sentence affected me a lot. It made me think of the past memories. It was so suited for this story. Every old house has its memories-painful and happy.Maybe when you are quiet, you can hear the voices of the people from the past-people who have lived and loved and died. This quote also made me think of something menacing lurking beneath the memories - I guess this was what the author wanted.When the author described the castle, I almost felt all the grief, the happiness, hidden in the castle walls  and yet found it so hard to completely penetrate the secrets of the hours gone by.<br /><br />Overall: Haunting, engrossing and shocking! I wish there was a stronger word to describe how much I love this book. After almost a year, this is a new addition to my list of favorite books.<br /><br />Recommended? YES ! A thousand times yes! No matter what genre you read, do give Kate Morton's books a try.

I can't say I'm disappointed, but at the same time, I'm not that impressed with it.  I have to say Fearless is much much better.  This album sounds exactly like all her other songs, but not as catchy.  If you are Taylor fan, then you will like this album.  But if you're not a hard-core fan, it's hard to say....  So my recommendation is, only buy this if it's on sale, haha.

B0049VZ2UY|5.0|When is the last time you cried during a zombie movie? Honestly, AMC's new series \\"The Walking Dead\\" (based upon the successful cultish graphic novel series) is, after Breaking Bad and Mad Men, their third show poised to be a remarkable and heavily awarded television series. Graphic in its gore content and violence, the pilot nonetheless presented a plausible and terrifying \\"end of the world\\" tale that is surprisingly personal with moments of great poignancy.     The central character, Georgia Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, is shot nearly fatally spending a long (unknown) amount of time lying in a coma, awakening from it and, barefoot and clad only in his hospital gown, stumbles through and emerges out of the hospital to discover a world devastated by some mysterious catylcismic event; a world nearly devoid of life.     Once again a fairly unknown British actor takes the lead in an American television series, but having watched Andrew Lincoln as Rick in this series, I fully believe the guy was made for the role (or the other way 'round). For nearly 70 minutes, Lincoln's Rick is mostly on his own, but his face - a magnificent mirror registering every emotion from self doubt, fear, grief, utter despair but also the hope of finding his wife and boy. Lincoln's is a tremendous performance of made all the more remarkable considering the genre and thus a rare opportunity for subtlety and introspection.     Rick's interactions with another father and son who capture, but ultimately rescue and aid his return to health, has a deep resonance in a world where men are considered stulted in understanding or expressing their emotions (a topic which is introduced nicely in the shows opening scene with Rick and fellow officer Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal).     If you love zombies (and who doesn't?) this new series is a must see. I honestly was blown away after the premiere, powerfully moved and properly scared to death!

Eric gives kudos to Ry Cooder and JJ Cale and when you hear the music, you understand why.  I look forward to many years of these collections.  I will die a happy gal.

Can't wait till the DVD goes back on pre-order, I'm going to order it that day.
B000YDG5X4|5.0|I had a huge smile on my face after trying on these boots today. As everyone in the comments section mentioned, the boots do run a bit large. I'm normally a 10.5 for all my shoes so I went ahead and order the size 10M and it was a perfect fit. I have been trying to find a place that actually has these boots in the Los Angeles area, but no one carries them. This was the first time I ever bought shoes online and it won't be the last. I was in Japan a few weeks ago and saw these boots for $275 US dollars so when I returned and saw the price at $124 it was a no brainer. These boots look awesome and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for some boots.

I've just ardered Compendium one of the comic book series, just becasue it's reviewes are so good, and i can;t wait to see what is up next.    Definatly the best new show in production.    Brian.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|The Red Letter Media \\"Avatar\\" review is spot-on. This is Hollywood's third attempt since the 1950s at marketing 3-D. It's kind of cool, but so what. Rather than coming up with new and original stories, 3D is just another gimmick to generate revenue by charging more money. The story is the most important thing in any movie and \\"Avatar\\" has a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling that rehashes everything from \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and \\"FernGully: The Last Rainforest\\" to Cameron's own \\"Aliens\\" and \\"The Abyss.\\" I don't think \\"Avatar\\" holds up very well to repeated viewings with its dated and overused message...
0525421580|4.0|So I love John Green. And for me, David's chapters just brought this book down.  The character wasn't as dynamic and it just wasn't as good at John's chapters. Overall it was a pretty good book and did a really good job of talking about the difficult topic of teen homosexuality. I think it would have been better if it was just John Green, but then I suppose it would have been called Will Grayson.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|I would hate to give this DVD less than 5 stars simply because the camera man has been on odds.<br />Okay, in places he 'shot' the wrong person - when Werther was singing his heart out to Charlotte, the camera hid Werther COMPLETELY and focused on Charlotte, apparently trying to capture the silent response of the lady. Here the camera man has forgotten ENTIRELY that this is an opera and not a movie. If one could make a demand, I would DEMAND THAT THE SCENE BE GIVEN AN ADDENDUM ON A BONUS DVD WITH WERTHER APPEARING IN FULL PICTURE.<br />This demand alone demonstrates how much substance has been put into the portrayal of the title role by Jonas Kaufmann, and how effective it is - the audience simply crave for any tiny missing bit.<br />As for other characters, I find Terzier's Albert very convincing both vocally and visually.  Having seen Leyla Gencer's black and white Covent Garden version on DVD lately, I have to admit that Sophie Koch does not fare as well as Ms. Gencer in this role - visually, Ms. Koch is to gaunt; vocally a bit (only a tiny bit, though) on the dry side compared to Gencer's mellifluous singing.<br />I haven't yet heard Kazarova and Vargas' Werther (it is on the way from Amazon), but I think Kaufmann fares just as well as any lyrical tenor, given that Werther is a very 'dark' character. In terms of pathos, he really measures up to, if not surpasses, the recording of Jose Carreras (with Frederica von Stade).<br />The stage production at Bastille, though minimalist, is very effective. Certainly not Eurotrash - it is utterly good taste and the setting highly romantic. The supporting cast is excellent, and veteran Plasson holds the pace in firm hands.  In terms of performance alone, a virtually 'perfect' piece.
B001HC7XCS|5.0|It was fun to hear Lady and the Tramp start out in Korean.  However it was easy to find the English soundrack.  Same wonderful Disney movie that I remembered from my childhood.
0345479092|2.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers that rated this a 1 or 2 star and their reasons.  I read this book very early on (before reading a lot of other parenting books and getting some \\"on-the-job\\" experience) in the first 2 weeks after my daughter was born.  At first the advice seemed comforting (I finally had a framework for how to respond to my baby!), but the more I read this book, the more horrible it made me feel.  She has a section on trying to figure out what type of baby you have and guarantees that you can predict this early on and that they don't change (and claims that once you know what type of baby you have (textbook, angel, spirited etc), you can respond to them in ways that are sensitive to their temperament).  Now with a 7 month old, I can say that she has exhibited all of the different types of temperaments and it has changed as she has gotten older.  A lot of the advice on breastfeeding, sticking to a strict schedule and putting your baby down for sleep were not helpful at all and started to make me feel awful when they didn't work for me.  I exclusively breastfed my baby for the first 4 months and then introduced formula when I went back to work and pumping wasn't working for me (and still breastfeed in the AM and PM when I'm with my baby).  I think Tracy downplays the benefits of breastfeeding that go beyond food (the comfort it offers your baby, ability to soothe an upset baby, the connection you build with your baby).  She warns not to always assume that a crying baby is hungry, which I totally agree with (you have to learn to identify when your baby is tired and needs a nap), and that you can overfeed your baby, which I totally don't agree with.  Overall, I think the tone of the book, some of the advice, and the definitive nature of how it is given can be detrimental to new parents looking for tips on how to best care for and communicate with their baby.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.  It leaves you smiling from ear to ear when it is over.  The children that I know who have seen it felt that the beginning of the movie was sad, but they loved the way the story unfolded.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A truly unforgettable, astonishingly touching book that is written with the kind of beautiful imagery and play of words that we usually only find in poetry or in books like \\"Beloved.\\" It's a great example of why we love to read. I read somewhere that it may be based on the author's own grandmother's childhood in Nazi Germany. Whether that's true or not, it's a good reminder that not every German in Nazi Germany was a heartfelt Nazi. I didn't realize until I had finished reading the book that its supposed intended audience is \\"young adults.\\" I found that a bit of a shock, because I think this is a wonderful book for all ages - STARTING, perhaps, at 13 or so - but for everyone after that. In some ways, it can be compared to \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" for its richness of characters and the beauty that can surround the simplest and most common (or uncommon) human relationships. Others here have given detailed glowing reviews of this book that I don't believe I can improve upon, so just read those. I am extremely grateful to the author for having made this wonderful book available via a Kindle download, although I will also be buying a hard copy for my granddaughter. Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S. I want to add that the Kindle edition did include the few essential illustrations that are in the hardcover edition.
0307155102|5.0|We received this book as a gift when my daughter was born. It has been one of her very favorites since she was about 10 months old. She is now 2 and even though we have looked at this book SO many times, it is still her first pick when she chooses a book. The illustrations are classic Richard Scarry, so fun and surprisingly detailed. I know reading this book with her has helped tremendously in helping her learn to talk, and even understand the world around her.     My only problem with the book (and this in no way takes away from my 5 star rating) is when she picks this book, I know we are going to be looking at it for at least 20 minutes at a time. We have to keep this in mind when selecting stories before bedtime or naptime because it means there is not much time for other books. Sometimes I hide it so we can read other books instead, LOL.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|When I first started reading, I found that I already knew much of the material--some of which I actually practiced. However, as I progressed into the book I found myself learning new methods of approaching code and new ways to apply old lessons. By the time I finished the book I found myself actively applying the techniques with renewed vigor and really enjoying writing code again.    Now that I've had a few months to let the advice sink in and use it on a couple projects and languages, I can safely say that I found the book on the whole to be an invaluable resource. I have integrated more of the material than I expected into my day-to-day coding practice, and I highly recommend it to my colleagues.
0439023521|5.0|This book may be more for teens, and I may be almost 30 - but this was the first book I've ever actually wanted to read twice.  And I did.  And it was worth the time.  A must read.
0345505387|2.0|This was a complete disappointment to me, as I had been enjoying Diana's books greatly. I thought it was a kid's book at first, until I saw the \\"graphic\\" drawings, poorly at that.  To me, the graphics took away from the story more than it added. I would hope that any more continuation of the story would be entirely in print and not in pictures.
B0041CGP02|4.0|This is a great 2 CD compilation of Bon Jovi's consistent long successful career titled, \\"Greatests Hits - Ultimate Collection\\". As with many compilations, not everybody will be pleased as some fans may feel 'some great songs' have been left out (but one's hit may be the other's bore & vice versa). What is encouraging/beautiful is the inclusion of 4 brand new songs composed specifically for this compilation (hopefully to please most fans), namely \\"What Do You Got\\" (first single/video), \\"No Apologies\\", \\"This Is Love This Is Life\\" & \\"The More Things Change\\". Disc 1 has 16 tracks : \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\", \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\", \\"Bad Medicine\\" & \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" are four solid tracks/gems that are a great representation of Bon Jovi's 'earlier sound' (hard rock with great guitars, wonderful melodies & beautiful harmonies). \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" is a great 'laid-back' track in their earlier years, great guitar entrance by Richie Sambora. \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\" is an okay track (hard rock sound). \\"It's My Life\\" & \\"Have A Nice Day\\" are two great laid-back tracks, they are Bon Jovi's 'later sound' (rock/pop sound as compared to their 'earlier hard rock' sound). \\"We Weren't Born To Follow\\" is a solid pop/rock track/gem with great vocals by Jon Bon Jovi. \\"I'll Be There For You\\" is another solid track/gem (laid-back track/ballad, great guitars & harmonies). \\"Blaze Of Glory\\" is a great movie soundtrack song by Jon Bon Jovi. \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\", this is a great solid pop/rock track/gem with great vocals & harmonies (a duet with Jennifer Nettes). \\"Always\\" is another solid track/gem (a ballad with great rhythm guitar & vocals). \\"What Do You Got?\\" is a solid new track/gem (great guitar, great vocals, beautiful melody & very persuasive lyrics. The guitar overdrive on this track is great)! The closing track, \\"No Apologies\\" is just an okay brand new track. Disc 2 has 12 songs that are good representation of their 'later sound' (pop/rock). \\"In These Arms\\" is great tackwith great melody & vocals. \\"Lost Highway\\" is rather pacy solid track/gem. \\"Keep The Faith\\" is solid track/gem that saw Bon Jovi 'moving' to their 'later sound' (great music & great range of voice by Jon Bon Jovi). \\"Bed Of Roses\\" is great ballad/gem with great guitars & vocals. \\"This Ain't A Love Song\\" is a great ballad. \\"These Days\\" is solid track/gem (pop/rock track, great melody & vocals). \\"Blood On Blood\\" is rather just okay track. Their fantastic performance at the American Music Awards ceremony 2010 was a highlight of the night! On overall, this is great compilation of Bon Jovi's musical career, including 4 new tracks, a recommended listening.

0321356683|5.0|As I revise and post this review of mine (March 25, 2011), I am delighted to report that the quality of the Kindle version that I've sampled, which include scalable code examples, has been vastly improved! Should you be interested in additional details and the background leading up to this vastly improved Kindle version of the printed book (\\"Effective Java, Second Edition\\"), please see the helpful and thoughtful comments that various readers have added to this review including, most recently, by the esteemed author (Joshua Block) himself!<br /><br />I've owned its forerunner (\\"Effective Java, First Edition\\") as well and, as always, I maintain that this peerless book is a fantastic compendium of all things Java, which will help deepen your understanding of the Java programming language. It's right up there with \\"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master\\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas!
B000PAAJYW|5.0|Even braver and deeper emotionally than Paul Thomas Anderson's<br />wonderful 'Boogie Nights', and in some ways a more mature, if less<br />blazingly dynamic work. Full of amazing shots, amazing performances.<br />The epic, multi-layered film 'Short Cuts' wanted to be.<br /><br />That said there are a few flaws. The biblical ending doesn't quite work<br />for me. I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that's<br />less emotional than the film that proceeded it. And a few<br />moments of irony are forced. That was true in 'Boogie Nights' too, but<br />because that film had a lighter, more self-mocking touch, even the<br />heavy handed moments didn't stick out.<br /><br />None-the-less, this is a must see film, overflowing with great<br />performances, unconventional storytelling, heartbreaking moments, and<br />an honest look at where we are and who we are as a society.
0984536132|5.0|This is not what you likely expect. The book itself is very interesting especially if you like history. Hitler spends most of the book discussing his childhood, his views on people, politicians he believed were destroying Germany, and explaining how he(single handedly by his account) built the Nazi party. He really makes you think about your own opinions and where they come from. You will find yourself agreeing with him in some areas without realizing why(so it gives you food for thought). It is a great behind the scenes revelation of the Nazi party too.    On the translation itself, this is an excellent translation which is easy to read and includes historical notations that explain the text. The introduction also explains the history of the book. There is even a separate book that goes with this one which explains how this one was translated and is filled with examples which show clearly that this one is more accurate than other translations plus it too has even more  history and a discussion of Hitler's writing style.    Well worth reading.
B003NWS5AO|1.0|I'm sad to say this is the worst cd I have ever purchased and I am a huge LZ fan. I bought it at starbucks and I want to burn it. Its like nails on a chalkboard. I'll stick with Amazon-so that I can read reviews before making a decision. oops.
067144901X|5.0|There isn't much to say about this book that isn't already posted, but I wanted to share our delight in Boynton's prose. My baby is 8 months old and giggles whenever we read this book.
0143118420|1.0|Why I Read this Book: I have seen this book around since it came out years ago (when it was all the rage) but I've never paid attention to it. First of all, it's non-fiction - not my usual cup of tea. Second, it's a memoir. Very rarely will I read a memoir. It has to be someone who really captures my attention. But then I found out that a film adaption was being made and Julia Roberts was staring in it as the main character so I decided to give this book a try. This is a time when I should have listened to my instincts but didn't.    What I Liked: The cover. It's a pretty cover.    What I Didn't Like: I only read 1/3 of the book. The part that I did read felt like the author was doing the whole \\"woe is me\\" pity party dance. She never explains why she's unhappy, just that she is and it really bothers me that she never justifies her unhappiness. Marriage, at least to me, is a huge decision and responsibility; marriage is not something to be taken lightly. And then to decide after 10 years that this is not what she wanted...? Isn't this what she signed herself up for? Maybe she should have stuck with dating; you can get in and out of dating much easier (and much cheaper) than you can with divorce, as our author discovers.    I didn't like the book but I thought the movie version would be bearable. Wrong. First, let me tell you why I wanted to see the movie. Like I mentioned before, one of the main reasons I read this book was because of Julia Roberts. I saw Julia Roberts on Oprah. The way she spoke about this book and how it affected her - wow! Julia Roberts was gushing about how this book made her feel; she was very passionate about it. So passionate that she only got 30 pages into the book to put it down to go on Amazon and buy a copy for her best friend. She waited until her BFF got the book in the mail and they read it together. Awww, how nice. I really like how Julia Roberts was so passionate about a book that she wanted to share the experience with her BFF.    When it comes to Julia Roberts, I am a sucker! I'll watch any and every movie that this woman is in. She's a great actress who really has mastered the art of bringing a character to life. I figured that since I wasn't able to finish reading the book, I'd give the movie a shot. To quote Ms. Roberts from a different movie: Big mistake. Huge! It's not often that I get to watch a movie at the movie theater. I should have watched Vampires Suck (there I was, going against my instincts again!). The only reason I didn't walked out of the movie theater was because of Julia Roberts. That is the only thing this movie had going for itself. Well, that and James Franco.    Overall Impression: I got to page 119 before abandoning ship. I got through the Eat part and after that, I just couldn't take it anymore. I felt no connection with the author. I didn't sympathize with her one bit. Never once does she explain why she got divorced. She tells the reader in the intro that she will not go into details about why her marriage fell apart. She just says that she was unhappy in her marriage but doesn't explain to the reader why she was unhappy. I don't get this; if you're going to write a memoir about your road to self-discovery, wouldn't you tell your readers how and why you ended up on that road to begin with?
B000PJ8WZQ|4.0|About two hundred years have passed since the Cathedral at Kingsbridge was built, as detailed in Follett's earlier novel \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  Now he returns to Kingsbridge to explore another turning point in England's history through the stories of the people who live and work in the city and its surroundings.<br /><br />Again, Follett provides an unflinching portrayal of the brutality of the feudal period, where serfs were only marginally better off than slaves, and where live was often short and violent.  As such, this is not a novel for people easily offended by violent or explicit content, though none of the content here feels gratuitous, but seems to genuinely reflect the reality of the period.  As the various characters struggle to find their ways in in their lives, we explore the conflicts between those who hope for change as a way to improve their lives and those who oppose it out of fear that it will deprive them of their privileges.<br /><br />In the end, it is the arrival of the plague that brings about the changes.  Follett shows both the fear and chaos that accompanied the arrival of the plague, but also how the sudden population dropped shifted the economic realities of the period and allowed many serfs to break the feudal bonds and gain their freedom.  In a very real sense, the plague brought about the end of the feudal system.<br /><br />With more that 1,200 pages, this book is almost the literary equivalent of a marathon, but it is deep and rich in detail, helping to bring this period of English history vividly to life.
0385738757|4.0|I really don't even know where to start. A whole year? Is that how long we have to wait? 365 days? Maybe more? I can't do it! I must know what happens next!!.....Okay, I will stop whining and actually talk about the book....The Scorch Trials picks up right where we left off in the first book. Dashner doesn't waste any time throwing his characters to the wolves and sucking us right into the world of WICKED again.<br /><br />I think I loved Thomas even more in this one! He is so level headed and mature. Not to mention brave! I would be crying like a baby if I had to deal with some of those things! I also really love Minho and Newt and I was sad that they didn't play a bigger role in this one. I liked the new characters that were introduced and I can't wait to see what role they will play in the end.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't like this one as much a The Maze Runner, but I still really enjoyed it. It was action packed and full of questions and snippets of information that make no sense! You will want to shake the book to see if some answers fall out! Each chapter ends with a tiny cliffhanger so it's impossible to put down! You tell yourself 'Just one more chapter and then I will sleep' 10 chapters later, you are still reading!<br /><br />James Dashner has pulled off a sequel that is packed full of nail-biting suspense and terrifying edge of your seat action. If you loved The Maze Runner you won't be disappointed!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|The cable works wonderfully and there's absolutely no issues in the quality. The quality itself is top-notch and you will not regret buying this over other models. I will readily buy an AmazonBasics cable product after my experience with this one as it provides good value for money without compromising on quality.
0312600844|2.0|I found The Corrections so tedious that I read from the beginning to the middle, didn't care at all about the characters, and then finished the book by reading from the last page to the middle--where I had previously stopped.  The book was better that way.  Not great--but better.  Franzen's newest book is just as tedious--the introspection goes on and on and on and on--but the characters are at least a bit more interesting.  Get the book from your library if you want to read it, but don't spend your money on it.  I can wait another nine years for another Franzen book.
B0010ZR160|5.0|This movie is great.  The language is a bit rough for the Baptist community but the story is great.  Starts out a bit slow but gets going great, just when you think you have it figured out it changes.  From a police officer view it is done great, from a mom's view, well that is a different view.  You have to watch this movie close from start to finish.  Highly recommended.
0765356147|5.0|Clearly, all that can be said about this trilogy has been said, but I just had to add to the rave reviews for it, especially for the 'Hero of Ages'. I read the first two books in quick succession and started on the third one, but had an occurence of sudden switch in interests which took me elsewhere (it could have also been a reluctance to see the series end). But when I ploughed back in, it was as if I had never switched away. The characters were still real, still complex, still evolving and very engaging. The climax of the series is well orchestrated. It feels like the only way it could have ended - which probably is the best thing you can say about any fictional work of art!!!<br />Elantris made me a fan, Mistborn trilogy has me going to the book shop to sweep all Sanderson's work into my basket!!!
B00009RAJH|5.0|Always liked Fleetwood Mac but never really owned much of the music.  This is a fantastic album, feel like I am rediscovering an old friend in a completely different way.  Songs bring back memories from wayward youth but meaningful today too.  Sorry I didn't listen more closely years ago!!
B000HWZ5X8|5.0|I remember buying this the day it was released. Where did those 20 years go? Percy is in fine voice and this is his hardest rocking solo material, but with plenty of light and shade. Quite why this album doesn't get the credit it deserves is something I've never really understood. If you're a Zeppelin fan in particular, this is a good one to pick up.
0439023513|5.0|Loved Loved Loved it.  I couldn't put this book, or any of the 3 Hunger Games books down!  I would recommend this book to anyone!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie...well over 200, no exaggeration. But this is the absolute best - I can't imagine it could be any better than this! The box set really adds an element of fun to the experience, with the books and the postcards and the music box. My ONLY complaint is that the 45th anniversary soundtrack that comes in this box set is not the same one that you can buy at Amazon. So even after spending $60 on this boxed set, I still went ahead and spent the additional $10 for the entire 25-track soundtrack (which is completely remastered and AWESOME). If you're going to buy the additional soundtrack, just buy the downloadable one, which has one track more than the CD that you have to wait to be delivered.    Make sure you watch all of the special features on disc 2. So much work was put into remastering this edition of the movie, and it was all well worth it. The final product is so absolutely breathtaking. And it really adds an element of depth when you watch it in surround. ENJOY!
0736420959|5.0|It's just enough to get them introduced to the characters and written in a way they can understand.  It's a kids book so it is condensed and is not the same as the movie, but the basics are there.  Great book!

B00005NB0H|4.0|The Who: Live At Leeds. We all know it in its various incarnations, and all feature incendiary performances of more or less tracks. The original LP and CD with the crackling noises due to dodgy microphone cable connections. The remastered CD with those noises mostly excised and more of the concert presented. And now.......the Deluxe Edition!<br />This 2CD set presents nearly the complete concert and is split into 2 parts - Tommy on disc 2 and the rest on Disc 1. Disc 1 is very similar sounding to the 1995 remaster, but minus Sparks/Underture, as that would become a part of disc 2.<br />Then there is the Tommy disc. What a performance! Leaves the Isle Of Wight recording standing boggle eyed and spluttering. But what happened to the sound? There is a nasty phasey quality throughout that sounds reminiscent of careless overuse of NoNoising to cheaply and cheerfully decrackle the Tommy performance, unlike the better care taken with the first disc.<br />Hopefully the Super-Deluxe version will feature another remastering that will release the Tommy disc from its poor sound, along with the Hull performance from the night after.

B001NESPHC|5.0|I had heard Melody's song \\"Worrisome Heart\\" some time back and had enjoyed it.  Fast forward to a recent visit to a classy, quiet, moody cafe in Bruges, Belgium where Melody's \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" was playing in the background.  In the dim vast empty space (only two of us) her voice filled the air and immediately caught my attention.  I asked the waiter for the CD title and ordered it upon my return.  I was afraid the effect wouldn't be the same back at home but upon receiving it I sat down with the lyrics in hand and listened.  Twice.  Melody's lyrics are pure poetry.  The atmosphere is moody, romantic, understated.  It's one of the most beautifully crafted CD's I've heard in a while.  It's pure genius and loveliness.
B001IKVOE2|3.0|I think if Amazon is going to offer an album at $5.00 they should also be offering the clean version of the album at the same price.  I prefer the songs without the bad language and would hope that they would want the young individuals looking at the site an opportunity to buy the clean version at the same price as the explicit version.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Blade Runner:Final Cut has seen Ridley Scott ditch the voice-over narrative by Ford and up-beat happy ending and added a dream sequence of Deckard's of a unicorn,thus proving he's a replicant too.The film adapted from Philip K Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a cult classic.In Dick's work on which this film is based, is an obsession with the blurring of reality, dreams and waking confused together, mechanical replicas indistinguishable from their originals,what is humanity?This hard-boiled SF noir set in a dystopian future with an impoverished nature and looming towers,balls of flame in the skies.The drifting ex-cop Deckard(Ford) is pulled back into the loop of bounty-hunting replicants,who have illegally returned from outer planets,where they are slaves,to find the secret to a longer life on earth.Dramatic action has replaced overt philosophising to good effect.Four androids are at large and Deckard must hunt them down.     The ways they are tested is by answering a series of questions,the answers to which show whether they have humanity.Although they failed the test,their behaviour is empathetic.Deckard finds enough life and humanity in these entities to stimulate his own sense of empathy.Deckard discovers not unfeeling robots he supposed them to be,but creatures in search of warmth,affection and personal ties he and his fellow natural beings are losing. Boundaries blur from sociopathy to empathy,and humans increasingly lose their souls in dealing out death and destruction or in materialistic pursuits.The dehumanising effects of technology on human life are latent.Androids become more `life-like' over time,humans more robotic to meet society's needs.Androids' intelligence surpasses humans,what about their rights?Are androids entitled to share our life,are we grateful for our life?Can't androids dream of electric sheep?     The Tyrell Corporation can do nothing to help,it has even programmed `memories' of childhood years,which is shown to deceive Rachel(Young)into thinking she is human.When Deckard forms an attachment to her (she also saves his life),he is forced to rethink what it is to be human and to be mortal.Although Deckard loves Rachel he is intent, while saving her, to kill all the other replicants.The human story,though somewhat subdued and thin,is overshadowed by the extraordinary sets and special effects,which are amazing.Are humans without emotions more valuable than machines with?Rutger Hauer's Roy gives a soliloquy prior to his own death (and after saving Deckard's life),about a replicant's dilemma:\\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\\"This is a thoroughly moving speech by a time-fixed replicant aware of mortality who has transfixed Deckard with his emotions and desire to have him as witness.The rain-soaked ,decaying Los Angeles of 2019 is vividly realized. The film addresses the psychological aspects of the future,not the CGI effects,not the action,but the everyday lives of ordinary people under horrendous conditions.The slower rhythmns and pace of things brings this out.I believe the Final Cut is the best version, the one intended by the director and should be the one we settle down with,as it bypasses the studio's sabotage through fear of what the director intended.Ignore the 'directors' version.He had no hand in it.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was the first book I bought and read for my 3rd Gen. Kindle and it was a great experience overall. I had read the previous books in paperback and it was an esy transition to an ereader format. The story itself is as engaging and enthaling as the previous two and fans of the series wont be dissapointed. In the end, everyone got what they deserved.
1584282584|5.0|This is a very complete and well-written book on lighting.  While the title indicates that it is for wedding photography, anyone who photographs events, even occasionally, can benefit from what's taught in this book.  While off-camera lighting nearly always produces the best results, there are a lot of situations where it's just not practical - and that's where these techniques come in.  Van Niekerk explains flash technology, thoroughly covers how and where to bounce your flash and balance the color and intensity with the existing light.  In addition to the technical information he also provides explanations of some of the basic creative principles of lighting. I learned a lot from this book that I know I can put to use!

B000KLRUJS|5.0|Make no mistake about it, next to Schoenberg's twelve tone operas, Strauss' Elektra is probably the most difficult of all operas for the neophyte to listen to. Most neophytes who love Salome upon first listening, cannot tolerate Elektra...it 'drives them up the wall'!  Composed just after Salome, Elektra, from a musical standpoint, is light years more developed than Salome and considered to be the most 'Strausserian' of all Strauss operas. Strauss saw where music was evolving and didn't have the heart to venture into the new dissonant territory. He went right up to the borderline of dissonance, but never crossed it, and Elektra is the work that epitomizes Strauss' innovations.  After Elektra, Strauss did an 'about face' and never returned to the stark, blood and guts that make these works so mesmerizing. Personally, I think it a shame, for his subject matter progressively became more and more insubstantial, depending more and more upon the strength of his music to support an otherwise bland storyline.<br />  For the seasoned listener, this recording is the definitive Elektra. There is no need to listen to any others, for none can surpass this! Over the years I have listened to this recording more than a hundred times and I never tire of it.<br />  Solti conducts the Vienna Philharmonic with such intense energy it requires almost as much from the listener as it does from the performers. First time listeners be forewarned: give this recording your undivided attention and you will spend the rest of your day in a trance!<br />  Regina Resnik IS the quintessential Clytamnestra. Her singing, while brilliant in sound, carries with it all the torture and torment of this demented woman, while her hysterical laughter, when hearing Orestes is dead, can never be equaled; likewise is her  shriek of pure terror when Orestes strangles her to death.  Resnik has here set the standard for all subsequent Clytamnestras to follow.<br />  Birgit Nilsson sings an angry, aggressive Elektraobsessed for revenge.<br />This is a fairly standard interpretation but what makes Nilsson stand out from all others is a voice that can shatter a 20 pound diamond!<br />  Marie Collier is not to be outdone as the gentle, feminine Chrysotemis. Other reviewers have criticized her for howling when she hears that Orestes is dead, but I think it adds wonderfully to the overall drama and suspect that her howl was, in fact, Solti's innovation.<br />  Tom Krause's Orestes is dark, sinister, and foreboding; In a word, perfectly cast.<br />  Likewise is Gerhard Stolze. His portrayal of Aegisth is beautifully gullible, cowardly and stupid.<br />  To reiterate: for me, this is the one and only audio recording of Elektra. All others pale by comparison. If the listener has an interest in Strauss at his absolute best, get this recording.....you'll never be sorry!<br />  For those interested, please check out my fully illustrated opera librettos in graphic novel form, available exclusively at The Metropolitan Opera Gift Shop and here on Amazon: [[ASIN:1450724140 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Puccini's Madama Butterfly]] [[ASIN:1450765807 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Ravel's L'Enfant et Les Sortileges (Librettos)]] [[ASIN:1450765815 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Gian Carlo Menotti's the Medium]]

B0032JTV6U|4.0|Love, love, love Glee. However each copy of Glee: The Complete First Season I have received (first one, then two replacement copies)has had a defect. I have tried on two different DVD players and for some reason I can't access episode three on disk 1. Same exact problem on each copy I have received. The show however is great.
1416550550|5.0|This was an easy read, but interesting twists through out the book. I enjoyed the book.  I don't want to give anything away--I accidentalyy did that when my friend and I were discussing good books.  This is one to read when you need an escape from your own realty.
1401223176|5.0|Let me tell you the story was a little hard to follow but most of the time that means it is not blatantly simple. However the art work is amazing!!!! I'm a huge Jim Lee fan and this work is amazing. When he made the switch his work only got better at DC. A hallmark in DC's collection of titles!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend for you and a friend!
B000U7169M|5.0|This is an excellent movie that always kept me on my toes,off my seat and my horror-loving pounding heart wanting more.Since I have always been interested in biblical times,more of the Old Testament,this movie is the way to go and to me,it is a movie that you wouldn't expect it to be in the end...really!!!!!.....You have to see to believe...
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Munford & Sons until a episode of Grey's Anatomy, when the beauty and the melancholic of a song stayed with me for a long time. Then I search for the band and stared listening to all the songs of the \\" Sight No More\\" CD. I have to say that I do not remember the last time that I liked every song in one cd. This is the case with this one.<br />If you like folk and originatively, you are going to love this band.
B0042AEOG0|3.0|I personally don't think is that great. I think that a lot of this album is about the hype and anticipation to see how it will measure up to her last xmas album. Obviously we are not going to hear some of the same high notes as the old one given her age, and many years of strain on her voice at this point, especially the higher notes. But listening to the songs, there obvoulsy is a solid voice still in there with some even more pronounced notes. Why she didn't use this voice in all her songs and even in her last few albums is beyond me. She has gotten into the habit of this 'whispering' voice in the last few years that it makes you think she has lost her voice completely. I was eager to see if this album would be any different and some of the tracks actually showcase that she still has a great voice left. Why don't you use it more often, Mariah? You are known for that voice and this 'whispering' thing has not been doing you justice and has been costing yu a lot of fans. It's not a horrible album but I definitely would only buy the tracks you like. Some of us miss her solid voice that is still in there despite the lack of the higher notes and wish we could hear more of it. Until then, we will have to reminisce over her old records. Somewhat re-doing the cover similar to the first was a cool idea though, kudos on that one!
B000007UA4|4.0|Let's Get To It was the album that Kylie Minogue really began to show her artistic and creative side on. The overall sound of this album explores elements of pop, dance, R&B and new jack swing.   the genre New Jack Swing is a blend of pop, dance and especially R&B.    The tracks on this album are great:    #1  WORD IS OUT - the first single released in 1991. This song is probably the best on the album because it contains a heavy New jack swing sound and really shapes the rest of the album.    #2  GIVE ME JUST A LITTLE MORE TIME - Kylie's cover of this song is fantastic. Basically just a pop song, but catchy to sing to and it definately stands out on the album. This was released as the third single. Kylie's vocals in this song have been subjected to critiquing however. I can understand why but honestly I think she's just belting out the words because she really feels them.    #3  TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING - This track also has a strong new jack swing and dance feel to it. Another standout track and Kylie also wrote it.     #4  FINER FEELINGS - a down-tempo pop track that was released as the fourth single. This song is good but I never seem to get into it as much as i want to. Nevertheless, lyrically I think it's very mature for Kylie at the time.    #5  IF YOU WERE WITH ME NOW - This song is beautiful. A duet with american R&B singer Keith Washington, Kylie and Keith wrote this song but apparently not together. There's a good chance the two never actually met because they wrote the song separately and their parts in the video aren't ever together so you never know. This is a R&B/pop ballad and was released as the second single.    #6  LET'S GET TO IT - the title track has a strong new jack swing/R&B sound and is another great song on the album.    #7  RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW - Kylie wrote this song and it combines elements of new jack swing and dance. Another great song.    #8  LIVE & LEARN - Kylie wrote it, It has a strong new jack swing sound, but for some reason I just don't get that interested in it when I hear it. Most of the time I skip it. Still a worthy song but.    #9  NO WORLD WITHOUT YOU - a lovely pop-ballad that Kylie wrote. Honestly, as nice as this song is, it would probably have to be my least favourite track. I really prefer the tracks that have that new jack swing/R&B/dance sound better.    #10 I GUESS I LIKE IT LIKE THAT - this song is a dance/house track. It doesn't have much (or any for that matter) new jack swing or R&B sound to it but it is still effective and Kylie also wrote it. A good energetic way to end an otherwise smooth, sexy album.    Let's Get To It is definately a benchmark in Kylie's career. I've always considered this album and her previous one \\"Rhythm of Love\\" to really be the start of the great Kylie we all love.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is a great set for any Sex and the City fan, and the easier on the wallet price is the reason to buy it from Amazon.
B000OPOAM0|4.0|Got this (Along with T2 Extreme) about a month back. When I opened it up I was greeted with a lenticular card glued onto the plastic wrap for the 2006 release. Naturally I was irritated with this absolutely stupid move by MGM to re-release films with no Special Features (And in the case of blu-ray, do an improper upscale that looks no better than DVD.).<br /><br />The film? Oh it was great, the quality was real nice too. Probably the only good thing about a DVD without any special features.<br /><br />And a quick note, the case was one of those econo-crappy cases with the big gaps in the plastic to \\"Save the environment\\". I love the environment and all but I hate these cases. They feel so cheap and flimsy. I might just swap a different case out.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I stumbled over this beauty because I saw the movie and thought the music was \\"all right\\"... jaja, \\"all right!!!?\\" It's magnificent!! I was amazed when I heard almost every song, each one with it's unique arrangements, but all with the same magic.    Wow, it's really difficult to find current soundtracks filled with so much excitement and passion, and at the same time originality.    Truly beautiful, from the start to the end. Prepare your dragon... and prepare for the flight.
B000002LCX|5.0|This is the first album I ever listened to by The Smiths, and it is definitely the one that got me hooked on their music. There's enough of a balance between catchy, poppy tracks and ones that are a little less accessible, which leaves the listener with the overall impression that the band is (was) versatile and capable of truly carving out their own unique niche within the world of music. At a mere 10 songs, it's just long enough to give you a healthy sampling of what these guys were able to do. It's a great album, and I'd strongly recommend it, especially to those who want a good starting point within The Smiths' catalogue.
B0025KN3Y8|5.0|This review makes no additional comments for the music.  The fine reviewers have done the heavy lifting.  I say only to those who play new vinyl releases that this one far outperforms my old CD.  The engineering is spectacular.  I have had several tests with my guests and this is a great reissue.
B000JML7EC|1.0|Just ordered and downloaded this book to my pc.  The book is not complete only 27 pages long!  What's going on?  Granted, I got it for free because it was advertised as a free book, but I really liked this book when I read it in Highschool and was looking forward to reading it again.  This was a total waste of time!
0061998494|5.0|I generally steer clear of autobiographies because my appreciation for artists tends to be greatly diminished by them. There have been several authors and actors I've ruined for myself because I'm too busy focusing on their tiny personal insanities to enjoy the work. This was referred to me several times by various family members, but I have avoided it for quite some time for just this reason.     I especially enjoy audio books read by their authors, and Craig was no exception. This was the first work that I actually found myself laughing out loud at and taking time to listen to when I would otherwise be doing something different. One of the best things about Craig is his ability to be highly amusing when he isn't trying to be funny. There were a great many such instances I think I would have missed had I actually read the book, instead of listened to Craig read it.
B001B7CNY2|3.0|U-571 is a non-historically accurate movie about a group of Americans who commandeer a Nazi U-Boat. Not everything goes according to plan, of course, and soon Matthew Mcconaughey and his buddies are scrambling and fighting for their lives. It's fast and intense, with fantastic set design and awesome sound. Make sure to turn your soundsystem up loud. You really feel at times as if your living room couch has become a claustrophobic, cramped vessel far below the sea. If this sounds cool to you, and you're not a stickler for historical accuracy, then U-571 should entertain you. Don't expect any unexpected character design or the most original plot of all time, but it's fun enough.
B002C1BHJ8|5.0|This cord is the highest quality HDMI you can buy at a price far, far below any retail cord of similar value.  The braided cord with the soft, flexible cover provides the highest speeds for 3D TV or maximum performance for high definition players.  This is not a standard HDMI cable.  Amazon also sells those for $6.99 and I highly recommend that if you want the retail equivalant.
0060558121|3.0|I had high expectations for this book. The plot summary on the back cover seems quite promising: The gods of the \\"old\\" way (Egyptian gods, Roman gods, gods of Norse mythology, culture heroes, etc.) are battling against the gods of the \\"new\\" way (media, television, internet, etc.). As someone who feels like this culture has too much technology and too little spirituality, my interest was immediately piqued. However, the execution left much to be desired. The biggest issue I took with this book is its tendency to drag. 588 pages of tedium with a few interesting tidbits thrown in here and there. I could usually finish a book like this in a few days -- it took me two weeks because I could only read about 20 pages at a time before losing interest. Also, you may want to have a bottle of Pepto handy when you read this book. Gaiman describes every gruesome thing in intricate detail -- from the homosexual sex in the hotel, to the sex that Shadow has with the Egyptian cat goddess (bestiality perhaps??), to the maggots and other creepy-crawly things living inside Shadow's undead wife. To say I was disgusted would be an understatement. Finally, I couldn't help but roll my eyes when the true relationship between Shadow and Wednesday was finally revealed. I don't want to throw any spoilers out there, but let's just say IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE!<br /><br />To be fair, reading about the actual battle between the gods, and the history of the mythology, was very interesting. Gaiman's lengthy examination of our fixation on technology and our resulting spiritual emptiness absolutely struck a chord with me. To sum up -- great idea, not-so-great execution.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|The Toy Story series is almost like a time capsule of my childhood.  I grew up with the lovable gang of toys and never really felt \\"too old\\" when treating myself to a viewing of their latest adventures.  Much of the growing up that Andy experiences throughout the trilogy rang so strongly with how I felt as I was approaching adulthood.  The latest iteration of the series is the true crescendo of when a child finally passes on what was once his world in exchange for a new one.  In a sense, this is what the toys experience as well.  Below I will describe my overall impressions of this fantastic PIXAR creation as well as my thoughts on the great blu-ray set...<br /><br />THE MOVIE:<br />While the trailers may give you the impression that this is a rehash of the old storyline where the toys end up trekking far away from home to rescue one of their comrades, it is far from this.  The goal this time is not to return to Andy's but to do whatever it takes to stay together.  You really come to care for the toys as a family and are invested in their fates.<br /><br />Though some were skeptical at the introduction of new players to the rowdy band of misfits, the new talent was marvelous and really meshed well with the regulars.  Keaton's Ken for example is one of the most hilarious toys to date.  His puppy dog love affair with Barbie and passion for fashion steals many of the films funny scenes.  Other honorable mentions go to Dalton's overcommitted thespian Mr. Pricklepants, Pena's \\"muy caliente\\" Spanish Buzz (I would Paso Doble with him anytime), and Beatty's drawling and deceiving Lotso.<br /><br />What really is the cherry on top of this PIXAR masterpiece is the larger than life world they create through the eyes of a toy.  PIXAR have always been great visual artisans and it really shows in this final chapter of the Toy Story saga.  The universe of the toys may have familiar elements of our own but still manages to be one we have never seen before.  Its scope is so huge, that it causes you to feel as tiny as a toy when trying to drink it all in.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY SET:<br />The blu-ray disc rivals any 3D that was offered by the theaters.  The quality is amazingly crystal clear and is neither muddy or grainy.  You will definitely notice that the colors pop more than the typical DVD version making it even more visually delightful.  The audio track is also nicely mixed and I appreciate that the voices of the characters are not drowned out by loud sound effects or booming music.<br /><br />The set itself is bursting with a bunch of extra material that makes it worthy of purchase.  Lots of the content is filled with video of the stars reading off their lines or the animators plugging away at models on their computers.  Lee Unkrich walks you through alot of the reasons behind certain scenes that were important to the story.  Unkrich's bonus material is especially fun to watch as you can tell the guy almost seems like a big kid himself.  The promotional extras are mainly a compilation of the YouTube and TV promos that were created leading up to the release of the movie.  Ken's dating tips is one of them that I recommend you definitely check out.<br /><br />In conclusion, the Toy Story 3 Blu-ray set is a must own regardless of whether you have seen the movie or not.  There's no need to waste money on a rental as the wizards of PIXAR have done the trilogy justice.  Let me put it this way, buying this movie is on-par with scoring a ticket to Disneyland - its always a joy to visit.as tiny as a toy when trying to drink it all in.

1599218011|5.0|Wow - this book is the HUGEST gift! For you - and for anyone you know who wants to become the healthiest and juiciest human they can be! If you've ever wished you had someone just lay out the Basic 101 facts on how to take care of your body and your Self, and put it all out there in the clearest, most real and BS-free way possible, AND make it all genuinely fun, and easy to follow... then Crazy Sexy Diet's for you! It's ALL in there!!! It's not some fad diet book you'll forget about a month after you bought it - it's an amazing resource, jam packed with practical information, advice from someone who really 'walks the talk', and an outrageous amount of support and inspiration that you'll go back to again and again. Crazy Sexy Diet doesn't just give you a Wake Up call - it cheers you on every step of the way, and gives you a loving kick in the butt every now and then to make sure you STAY awake and experience the JOY of REALLY being ALIVE!!! You know that memorable deli scene in When Harry Met Sally - when Estelle Reiner sees Meg Ryan have that all-out, table-bangin', loud screaming 'orgasm', and then says to the waiter \\"I'll have what she's having!\\"? Check out any one or two of Kris Carr's vlogs on YouTube. And check out Kris... Really take a good look at how that girl glows. And really listen to what she says... If you do that, and say \\"I'll have what she's having!\\", buy this book and follow her Crazy Sexy plan (which includes a boatload of the best health info and advice from leading experts!) and you WILL have what she's having! And oh yeah - there are some hugely fabulous recipes in there too. Dean Ornish ends his brilliant foreword for Crazy Sexy Diet with this - which I think sums it all up so beautifully: \\"Consider this not a diet book, but a guide to living fully; not a meal plan, but a road map to self-empowerment, adorned with Kris' unrivaled enthusiasm, humor, and compassion. And by the time you finish this book, there's a good chance you may love Kris too\\".  Dean - I couldn't have said it better myself.  Only I think I might add - \\"And by the time you finish this book, there's a good chance you may love your Self too\\".

055358894X|4.0|A very high energy book, The Lies of lock Lamora follows a swashbuckling con artist from his start as a small child to his rise in power in his twenties. He manages to interact with and swindle members of all levels of society. When his plans impact and endanger political and criminal leaders alike, his world is rocked in ways he didn't expect.     I liked this book, but it's hard to get too attached to any of the characters as so many (friends and enemies) die before the end. Not to give too much away - enough characters survive for a sequel - but no one is safe. Letting characters live longer would have allowed deeper, more nuanced personalities and relationships to emerge.
B003M0H4OU|4.0|Much anticipated and nicely engineered product. However, it's a little sparse on time unless you get this deluxe edition. Yes, the 3 extra songs make it worth it. His best? No, I don't think so, and while they are pushing his I LIKE IT track, the real showstopper is HEARTBEAT. I had this on at a party and people really took notice! For this song alone I would give 5 stars, but the rest of it just doesn't equal this one great track. Enrique helped write it and he really needs to push this song!

B002ZG99N6|4.0|With GONE, BABY, GONE, Ben Affleck announced himself as a very capable director.  It was a riveting film (even if it had some rather melodramatic turns...more the fault of author Dennis Lehane), and showed an excellent feel for working with actors.  With THE TOWN, Affleck has stepped up his game another notch.    Very little that's truly new happens in THE TOWN.  It tells the story of a small band of bank robbers, the cop who seeks them, and how the leader of the gang wants to get out and go straight, mostly out of love for a woman who is transforming him.  This is a genre film...pulp even.  These kinds of movies have been with us almost since movies began...and yet well-made crime films still grab us (HEAT springs to mind, but there are plenty of others) and poorly made ones are quickly forgotten.  THE TOWN is certainly in the earlier category.  It may not emerge as an all-time classic, but it is a sturdy, solid film with a true feel for its Boston locations and some outstanding performances.    Ben Affleck is Doug, the leader of the gang.  His team wears comical masks and makes fast, non-violent robberies.  But one day, things go a little awry, and the gang grabs a hostage, Claire (Rebecca Hall).  Although she is released safely, there is fear that she may be able to ID her captors.  Doug's childhood friend, and resident psycho,  James (Jeremy Renner) wants her dead.  Doug, taking a more reasonable approach, wants to meet her and talk to her, to see if she recognizes him.  Not only does she not recognize him, but the two fall into a romance.  This doesn't set well with James, who has always imagined that Doug would marry his sister Krista (Blake Lively).  The two have a strained relationship, which is tested more and more as the film progresses.  Hot on their heels is FBI agent Frawley (Jon Hamm); yet at the same time, neighborhood crime boss Fergus (Pete Postlethwaite) insists that the gang keep working, since he always gets a cut of their jobs.  Doug is torn, but agrees to \\"one last heist.\\"    Affleck is from Boston, and his two films show that he knows the neighborhoods very well.  We don't get the glossy, touristy vision of these cities.  We see the tough neighborhoods, the lower-middle class streets and the business districts that are off the main roads. (Although we also get some interesting backstage looks at the baseball stadium.)  THE TOWN has a very strong sense of being in a very specific place.  This gives the entire film a sheen of reality.  It's a genre film with many familiar elements, but the specificity of the surroundings help make it seem more original than perhaps it is.    Affleck also gets solid performances from everyone.  Best of all is Jeremy Renner (THE HURT LOCKER)...he's charming and dangerous in equal measure.  We've sure seen this character in many films before...friend who drags down those closest to him...but Renner makes James a very specific character, and truly makes his role rise above cliché level.  Rebecca Hall does nice work, and Jon Hamm is stolid and straight-laced.  Blake Lively plays very effectively against type...she is far from a Gossip Girl.  And special notice goes to the always amazing Postlethwaite (his villain is a truly slimy guy...no one can ooze danger better than this guy) and to Chris Cooper, who plays Affleck's father in one scene that is so well-written and performed, we pretty much learn all we'd ever need to about the relationship between father and son.    Affleck keeps the pace moving along at a decent clip.  He doesn't try anything fancy...his films almost feel like throwbacks to the gritty urban crime movies of the `70s...you can almost imagine Pacino or DeNiro of that era fitting right in here.  And Affleck clearly knows how to work with actors...he's been able to assemble stellar casts in both of his films and to get very nice performances all round.  He handles tone very well...when funny things happen, they are always organic and never take us out of the mood of the film.    Affleck the actor is not quite so hot.  He's better than usual here...but honestly, I wish he would just stay behind the camera.  Ben Affleck seems like a terrific, genuine smart guy with a great wife and an appreciation of how good he has it.  But when he acts, he seems like a charming lug.  He doesn't ruin his own film (not by a long shot), but another, more skillful performer might have elevated THE TOWN another notch.      That being said, this is still an excellent film and is highly recommended for adult audiences looking for some drama and action that actually feels like it might be happening in our world.  I eagerly look forward to Affleck's next effort.
0061438294|5.0|Due to unfortunate circumstances in my life, I grew up quite alone, and without a good role model.<br />Consequently I didn't know how to show \\"tells\\" appropiately. This created great pain in my life as<br />I couldn't figure out why people would be so put out with me, especially authority figures.<br /> I thought I was making people comfortable by slouching in my chair and tilting my head slightly<br />sideways and down to the right. I had no clue about sitting up straight when authority walked in<br />the room, or being at an interview, etc.<br /> Reading this book has helped me realize this and so much more. I bought this book so I could<br />read people, but ended up changing my own \\"tells\\". Thank you Mr. Navarro.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|Have not had time to even open this product; but it is new so I have no doubt it is good.

B004132HZS|5.0|I don't often watch PBS but managed to catch this series and loved it.  I am a Holmes fan but it isn't automatic that I like anything and everything Holmesian.  I enjoyed the Jeremy Brett series and the recent movie with Robert Downey, Jr., as well as the old B&W movies with Basil Rathbone.  Holmes cannot be any cooler and Watson is a great character in his own right--not just an extension of Holmes's persona.  I hope this series continues for a good long time.
1416972242|4.0|This book was so much better than the first one in my opinion! At first I was a little bored with it, but once I got into it I couldn't put this book down! In this book Clary and Simon start trying to be girlfriend/boyfriend. I actually enjoyed the interaction between these two...obviously it isn't the same as the interaction betweeen her and Jace, but entertaining nonetheless! Jace became even more appealing, sexy and charming in this book. I loved the tension between him and Clary and hope that in the next book they find out they are not really brother and sister. I think that is where this series is headed!! I am thrilled about Simon becoming a vampire! I was beginning to feel kind of sorry for him because he was so normal...LOL!<br /><br />This book is one of those books that you really enjoy reading and are caught up in it while you are reading it, but you don't say WOW when you finish it. It is a wonderful book that tells an entertaining story!! I can't wait to read City of Glass!
B000089RV6|3.0|It's slow and silly. If you had trained your pre-teens to play this (hardly any skill required) you'd be clipping coupons and skiing in St. Moritz.     The lyrics are dumb.  The playing is sub-high school skill level.    But a passing adult must have written, 'You Shook Me All Night Long.'  As a celebration of lust, it's up there with Van Halen's 'Drop Dead Legs.'    How do I know this stuff?  Everybody likes simple, silly stuff.
0393072231|3.0|Let me start by saying that Michael Lewis is an excellent writer. His books are enjoyable and largely easy to read. That said, I can't enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone as I believe he falls somewhat short in making complicated concepts easy enough for the lay audience.  Can anyone adequately describe the intricasies of CDOs?  I doubt it--which really is the problem that cratered the economy. There were still too many points in the book when I felt totally lost and unable to grasp what he was talking about. The storyline of Mike Burry however was enjoyable and shows that someone with greater than average intelligence but amateur market skills can still make a lot of money.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|Love the show,and I am not the only one, we talk about it with the other moms when we go pick up our kids from school. It reminds me all the books by BK I've read, can't wait to see more.
0684135051|4.0|This is not a knitting manual, its a really lovely read. Elizabeth gives knitting personality and life.

B003EV6DBM|2.0|Steven Moffat turned Doctor Who into the Amy Pond Show, or an ersatz \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\" He uses Doctor Who to make \\"his mark\\" rather than respect the genre and characters. At its best, this British pop-culture phenomena reflects deeper values, legends, and myths. Moffat's anti-continuity regeneration reinvents the wheel and the Doctor. Doctor Who's heroic intensity is squandered, mired by women with rotten attitudes. Big explosions and fluff don't equal real imagination, Mr. Moffat. Like disco-era John Nathan-Turner, ego runs amuck; even the opening score is ruined. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan lack the maturity or charisma to reach beyond these limitations. Viewers are subjected to poor dialog delivered in loud, rapid-fire staccato mumbles; this does not make bad stories more interesting. The fellow with the thankless task of playing Pond's Rory would be a better Doctor, given half a chance.<br /><br />Moffat's Doctor is a vehicle for his own perpetually adolescent framework, rife with obnoxious women reflecting childish (in a bad way) fantasies. Russell T. Davies left and the show turned girly. The Doctor is saddled with a sullen sulking boring sidekick, Amy Pond, a neurotic nightmare. In Moffat's \\"The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone,\\" she utters the loathsome, \\"Are we there yet?\\" The vapid Pond is permeated with Botox flat-affect, an un-enticing creature only a peculiar (in a bad way) old man would find attractive, dolled-up in silly skirts and cowboy boots. Her boyfriend Rory is a pathetic joke (no fault of the actor). As a child, Pond kneeled at her bedside praying to Santa Claus, but as a petulant adult she ridiculously throws herself on that bed demanding the Doctor's services. Is this for children? Or demented old men? Pond is no Donna Noble, no Rose, no Martha Jones, no Sarah Jane Smith, no Zoe. \\"Hello, Sweetie.\\" Translation: \\"Hi, you dumb ...\\"<br /><br />Sandwiched between women telling him how dumb he is, the Doctor can't summon Tennant's energy and intensity. Moffat's vat of blandness flattens the Time Lord's cosmos, grandness and majesty are missing. The young actress Caitlin Blackwood, as the child Pond, does a great job. Alex Kingston's character is the only semi-strong one, thus she dominates her scenes, something not possible in previous seasons. Writers like Chris Chibnall and Richard Curtis (Tony Curran steals the show as Vincent) provide much better episodes than Moffat's. The only reason Moffat's previous \\"Blink\\" was good is that Davies rewrote the script with help from other talents. The season's great story was written by Gareth Roberts, \\"The Lodger.\\" Roberts created a classic of British Sci-Fi, perfection. \\"The Lodger\\" features a rescue by teapot: Doctor Who pouring medicine down the throat of his kindly plump roommate. Later, he converses with a very attractive cat on the mysterious stairwell. James Corden is a delight as \\"Craig,\\" while Matt Smith does his best in this story, frenetic and eccentric (of course). The Doctor bangs his head on the above roommate, communicating images of past Doctor Who incarnations; this is Gareth Robert's invitation to inspire your investigation into the vast old series.<br /><br />I enjoy the TARDIS by exploring venerable episodes of the past, and we're talking decades. Not all Doctors were created equal. In the 1980s, producers lost their minds and respect for Who fans, as they have now. The unique music was badly altered from Grainer's original score, and costumes lacked the 1960/70s thrift-store flair of the original. Peter Davison and Colin Baker were aberrant versions; Davison walked through the part like a Plastic Man. Sylvester McCoy tries, though fans pity the capable actor forced to run around in \\"Delta and the Bannerman\\" like a fool. Thankfully, Russell T. Davies and his Doctor Who restored the intelligent alien with the eccentric grace of Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, and Tom Baker. You may want to try an episode that influenced Davies: [[ASIN:B00005LMAC Doctor Who: Spearhead from Space (Story 51)]]. This campy romp stars the great Jon Pertwee, whose portrayal of the super-intelligent elegant cosmic eccentric flavours Tennant's Doctor.<br /><br />I have to get Amy Pond's brittle whining out of my head with heroic Hartnell and Pertwee classics. The kid's [[ASIN:B002N1AEX2 The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Second Season]] features the incredible good-sport and fine actress Elisabeth Sladen, elegant as Sarah Jane, better than anyone on the New Who, with her crew of smart children, especially the talented actor who portrays her son Luke. The disappointing [[ASIN:B0043988NA The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Third Season]] inflicts Sladen with orange glop. But it features a story written by Gareth Roberts, containing Tennant's last appearance, \\"The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith.\\" Before allowing Sarah Jane's young companions into the TARDIS, Tennant deftly evokes Hartnell with one precise phrase and motion.<br /><br />Notes on Season Six, Doctor Boo-Who, or The Amy Pond Show:<br />Again, I'm trying not to blame the actors; it's not their fault that Moffat blandly flattens the Time Lord's cosmos; grandness and majesty are MIA. Even the distinctive English landscape is ditched in favor of the surreal. Under Russell T. Davies, the U.K. itself was a complex character of the series. But Moffat's bloated budget and silly concept of American fans turns Doctor Who into an incoherent version of the X-Files. Fans delight in the Doctor's Britishness, and don't want pandering. No one cares about watching a bad American president portrayed preposterously. But hey, Moffat couldn't even get Churchill right. Without substantive stories, all rules are off. The over-rated Neil Gaiman's fantasy nightmares don't even try to make sense; pointless punches are pulled on shallow cartoon characters. The immature Doctor can't shine, stuck with griping harpies. Boo-hoo, Pond leaks. Who cares? Pond's loathsome, \\"Are we there yet?\\" of Season Five set the tone for Season Six. Moffat offers no Steam Punk, but an overheated radiator.<br /><br />Straining to broaden the market, Moffat's opening sequence focuses the narrative on Little Miss Moffat, i.e., Amy Pond. Strong women aren't whiners, as anyone blessed to explore the cosmos with one knows. Again, dolled-up in silly skirts and cowboy boots, Pond is no Action Girl. Alex Kingston's character again dominates her scenes. Again, Pond's poor husband Rory is a pathetic joke (no fault of the excellent actor). Doctor Who is merely a creature dominated by obnoxious women with rotten attitudes. In Season Six, \\"Day of the Moon,\\" a quivering Amy Pond inflicts us with: \\"It's a figure of speech, moron!\\" and \\"Hey, stupid face!\\" Or we again get River Song's unbelievable \\"Hello Sweetie,\\" you dumb ...<br /><br />Moffat and the over-rated Gaiman indulge in fantasy, envisioning Doctor Who as a freak-show. The Disneyish pirate episode \\"The Curse of the Black Spot\\" explores Moffat's parenting issues. It adds nothing to the Who Oeuvre. Gaiman's comic-book shtick is in full Victorian Drag during \\"The Doctor's Wife,\\" with his usual Alice in Wonderland gimmicks. The Doctor further regresses into an inept anti-hero: a stuttering, self-conscious, doddering young man floundering in piles of Gaiman's sloppy Victorian junk. It's cut and paste imagery, sampling, not creativity, and tedious running in corridors. This emotional, sentimental manipulation attempts to involve us, but it's not coherent Sci-Fi. The Doctor is already psychically sensitive to the TARDIS, but in Gaiman's fantasy play-world, the TARDIS is reduced to human form. She blurts, \\"What am I saying? Why am I saying it?\\" Who cares? Gaiman reduces the original TARIS to vacuous stupidity, with her overweening need to be called \\"Sexy.\\" Yeah, right. The extraordinary TARDIS done up in a frock and simpering is boring, sexist, not sexy. Only one point, that the TARDIS stole the Doctor, and not the other way around, is interesting. \\"The Rebel Flesh\\" is better Sci-Fi, at least the noxious Pond is quieter, and poor Rory is given more to chew on.<br /><br />Fans wish the superbly talented Doctor Who writer Gareth Roberts, who added historic depth and polished humor to the Doctor, could rescue the series. Meanwhile, Doctor Who has left the building, and even the TARDIS is too clean.<br /><br />A shout-out \\"Amen Brother!\\" to reviewer Robert Hindla of The Real Who-ville.son Five set the tone for Season Six.

B000NY17J6|5.0|This cd of Linda is from the early 70's to mid 70's. Love her music back then. Brings back some good old times when I grew up. Some of her songs on the cd include 'Long Long Time\\", \\"Love Has No Pride\\", and \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" among other great ones. I recommend this cd if you grew up like I did in the seventy's and like this easy to light rock music.
193413712X|3.0|This book is about a man who is dying and his memories as he reached back into his past and recalls his early days of not having enough food, not having enough material goods, and genrally being quite poor. His memories of his father the watchmaker are interesting but the incredible level of detail he goes into around the clockmaking process is cumbersome and you find yourself quickly tiring of it.  His writing is no doubt eloquent but my interest waned as I continued on through the book.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|i loved this movie as a kid, it is cheesy as cheesy can be but it is a good fun movie for kids and those wanting to remember the movies they loved back in the 80's.  if you like this you need flight of the navigator one of my other favorites from back then.  so happy to find this movie.

0618918248|4.0|These past several years I've become part believer, part skeptic, and part seeker.  I had begun to question my faith in Christianity and in the idea of god himself.   In my search I've read several books and watched several debates and documentaries.  After just finishing Hithens' [[ASIN:0446697966 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]] I moved onto the 'The God Delusion.'  As with Hitchens I found Dawkins' use of history quite intriguing.  While I preferred Hitchens' tone (for lack of a better word) more so than Dawkins, I still enjoyed Dawkins' perspective.  I know that die-hard atheists don't need convincing and will automatically approve of the subject matter; while the die-hard christian will never agree.  Being someone in the middle, someone searching, I'd recommend this book for the author's perspective alone.  After reading a few pro-religion titles, it's only fair I read the opposite.  That said, I'm not quite sure yet if I 100% agree with Dawkins; but anyone willing and/or interested in another perspective then this book is for you.      Good day.

0312600844|2.0|This book is highly readable, in much the same way as Stieg Larson is readable. When you put it down, it turns out to be equally empty. It's nearly all dialogue and there are many unexpected emotional twists and turns. However, the characters are negative, vacuous and self-destructive and their various intrigues become increasingly tedious as the book wears on. Plot elements are mechanical and unconvincing - notably a falsely ecological bird conservation project, in reality a cynical scheme of \\"Big Coal\\". Baby boomers may find some nostalgic interest in the settings and decor; readers from younger generations may be perplexed by their universally alienated contemporaries among the book's characters.In no way lives up to the hype.
B000FSME1A|4.0|THe film is fantastic!  The redux is a bit redudant (you know why some of the stuff was cut out in the first place) but stilla top grade war film.  The theatrical version is perfect and excellently paced.  WHat's annoying about this DVD is that both films are split in half.  Wouldn't it make more sense to have one version on one disc and the other on another?  THat's the worst.  And I think \\"Hearts of Darkenss\\" should've been included on this DVD.  What's the deal?

0307346617|4.0|\\"World War Z\\", a firsthand report of events leading up to and following the global battle of living versus undead, encompasses numerous personal views varying in age, culture, educational background, politics, and gender.  The traveling journalist visits his sources in short dialogue segments several times to obtain the latest updates during different eras of the war presenting the tense anticipation, the tireless battles, and the physical and psychological aftermath.<br /><br />The fascinating book could have been easily expanded over 1000 pages or a series, but efficiently covers the rumors of infection, the eventual spread across the globe, and the sacrifices of surviving the battle against the growing horde.  The entire dynamic of the zombie existence, the merits of extreme cold or hazards of the ocean, is superb.  The storyline truly captures a struggling spirit against a mindless and unconventional foe.<br /><br />I highly recommend the novel to any fan of the undead genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B0000019PA|1.0|Absurdism is such a lost art in popular music that once the public gets their first taste of it, they're ready to declare their discovery the holy grail. Unfortunately this music is far too shallow and twee to justify the supreme heavy-handedness of sexual lyrics about Anne Frank, among other transparent attempts at \\"twisted\\" \\"whimsy\\".
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|After being such a big fan for so long it is easy to see how strong independent women everywhere have a tendency to cling to these powerful glamorous women.  In a world where women rule and the topic is sure to be titilating who wouldn't be enticed?    I was however thrown for a moment when I realized that a show named for sex had been planted in the middle east and my beloved characters whom I have cherished for so long were no longer behaving the way I would have expected strong mature intellectual women to behave in a culture clash society where propriety takes a front seat.    I cannot believe that these women would be so naive as to believe that an \\"anything goes\\" mentality is permissable everywhere.  One warning and near imprisonment apparently is not enough to entertain this valuable lesson before another public display is nearly getting all the girls arrested.    I have to say while reaching for comedy, the writers reached too far and completely distorted what could have been a truly fantastic movie.
B003O86MY8|3.0|I heard Garret for the first time last week, where else, Barnes and Noble. Ordered this album immediately. Having listened to it several times and watched Garret perform on Youtube, I like a lot of what he is doing and recognize his huge talent. As a person who loves and plays both rock and classical music myself I am all for these kinds of mixes.  I did not love this album as much as I thought I would upon listening several times, my incomplete love is due to the arrangements, which have some nice aspects but are rather, er, Las Vegas, tacky, slick, and grandiose at times. Team Spirit I like a lot, as well as the the classical selections, with the exception of the drumming on the classical based pieces, its just kind of tacky, imagine what he could do with a more tasteful drummer of Billy Cobham's or Bill Bruford's class.     I hope he keeps working on this, since I know quite well how a good orchestra should sound I hope that he can find arrangements and orchestras that lose that Vegas glitz sound but keep the basic idea he is working on.    Some of the best parts are where he gets some dueling going with the guitarists, then we get something a little Dixie Dregs like, and that works, in my opinion, better.  Picture Garret working with the Dregs, or at least Steve Morse, that would be cool.     I'm editing my review of Rock Symphonies because my wife exposed me to another similar violinist, Vanessa Mae.  At least to judge by the comparison to this particular album, David comes off as a distinct second best. If you like David's mix of Rock and Classical give a listen to Vanessa Mae. She has it all and in really fine taste, none of that Las Vegas feeling.    I still really enjoy certain parts of David's playing, but so much of the arrangement is really tasteless. I still have enough pleasure from his style that I will explore some of his other albums that certain reviewers considered to be better than Rock symphonies.

B00004W50T|4.0|In 1967, after backing up Dylan on his rough \\"electric\\" tour, The Band retreated to a rented house called \\"Big Pink\\"  in Woodstock, NY where they wrote and recorded over 100 songs with Dylan, which produced the eventual release called the  \\"Basement Tapes\\" in 1975. The music written for Music From Big Pink was also from that period.<br /><br />When this album came out in '68, I remember being taken aback with it's un-pretentiousness and honesty. The Band sounded as though they were musicians from the late 19th century, often with a Salvation Army band supporting. Everything about this album was different for the times: the music, the lyrics, the dress, the jacket photos, the sound, etc. Even when using modern instruments like the electric keyboards and guitar with effects, their sound is earthy and early America. The songs mix country, folk, blues, jazz, rock, gospel and even classical elements. There was soul in the lyrics, in the playing, in the singing, in the groove of the drums, and in the solos. Clapton has often referred to this album as being a favorite of his. In his recent biography he states \\"It stopped me in my tracks...\\".<br /><br />Most of the album was recorded on four tracks at A&R in NY where two tracks were used to record the band live. Track three was used for horns, and track four for vocals and tambourine.

Only two of these tracks are alternate versions of songs on the album; \\"Tears of Rage\\", which is maybe just below the original, and \\"Lonesome Suzie\\", which is given a shuffle/swing style arrangement.<br /><br />The other original bonus tracks include the very strong \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\", Dylan's \\"Long Distance Operator\\" with an excellent drum groove by Helm, \\"Kattie's Been Gone\\", \\"Orange Juice Blues\\" a great song demo with just bass, piano and vocal by Manual, and \\"Ferdinand The Imposter\\", another good tune. but in mono.

B0000025D0|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Springsteen/E street records, so why can't AMAZON create separate reviews for this boxset as opposed to bunching all reviews of all releases as though it wasn't just sBRUCED-up?  It's annoying and confusing to have to wade thru 10 year old reviews to find one referring to the most recent version.  Lazy presentation of a new product won't help consumers looking for some advice from fellow musiclovers if they can't find the review for a specific item.  Sorry to rant but it's common sense.

B00005QC4O|3.0|The Grateful Dead's \\"American Beauty\\" was their sixth release, but arguably their first really professionally recorded album. The album was recorded at Wally Heider's new studio in San Francisco in August and September 1970 by Steve Barncard. Garcia liked the sound of the studio when he recorded steel guitar on Crosby, Still, Nash & Young's \\"Deja Vu\\". Steve was especially good at capturing acoustic instruments of which there is plenty of, and this album was certainly a second installment of \\"Wokingman's Dead\\", with again, no experimenting or jamming. Though not your typical Dead presentation, it is full of great tunes and performances, and many consider it their favorite Dead album. It is one of mine.<br /><br />In 2004 Rhino issued this remastered version that contains a two sided disc. The CD side is your regular 44.1kHz/16 bit release of the album. The DVD side has the entire album in 5.1 surround sound and in higher 96kHz/24 bit resolution. It also has the entire album in stereo 192kHz./24 bit resolution.<br /><br />Though not remixed, the CD side does not sound nearly as good as the regular CD issue and box issues from Rhino that were remastered in HDCD by Joe Gastwirt and contain bonus tracks. On the DVD side, both the 5.1 and stereo versions credit Mickey Hart (yes, their drummer) as Surround Sound and Stereo Remix Producer, Sound Design, Engineer and Mixer, with Tom Flye as Chief engineer and Mastering Supervisor.  The remix will be interesting to serious Dead Heads as there are many new things to listen for. For example; it seems that with the new mix, faders were often left up so you can hear instrument and vocal parts that were originally removed. This is fun stuff to hear, no doubt. There are also many song intros and outros to hear for the first time.<br /><br />The problem with the DVD side is the very poor fidelity. Even with the higher bit words and sampling rates, it sounds very flat and congested in the sense of soundstage, dynamics and timbre.  Even with the separation of surround sound, the instruments are not as individualized as they should be. For example, the emotion of Garcia's pedal steel and Wales' organ solos on \\"Candyman\\" are buried. There is also an added  reverberation effect to the entire work that makes the remix sound like you are listening to the band doing a sound check in a small auditorium. This changes the entire feel of the album for the worse in my opinion. The original recording is studio dry and sounds like the band came over and are playing in my home as if we were friends. It is much more intimate with more presence, detail and better tonal balance than this remix. My favorite issue is still the MFSL analog LP.<br /><br />The DVD includes a photo gallery (thirteen photos) and two short interviews; one with Mickey Hart about his remix approach, and one with Bob Weir about writing \\"Sugar Magnolia\\".f surround sound, the instruments are not as individualized as they should be.

The first new LP Record for me in 30 years, after hundreds of CDs.  So clean, so pure.  The bottom left corner of the album jacket says \\"750 ml\\".

B003ZSH606|5.0|\\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" is UK Acid Jazz act Jamiroquai's first album in 5 years and one listen to the smooth title track which opens the album shows they've still got it: Jay Kay is still trapped in a seventies Funk/Disco bubble heavily inspired by Stevie Wonder.<br /><br />The pair of \\"White Knuckle Ride\\" and \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\" are groovy dance numbers, while the deep scratchy bassline on \\"All Good In The Hood\\" recalls Chic. Slowing things down are the choppy groove of \\"Hurtin'\\", the breezy pair of \\"Blue Skies\\" and the horn-sprinkled \\"Lifeline\\", while \\"Never Gonna Be Another\\" is a retro Soul ballad.<br /><br />\\"She's A Fast Persuader\\" keeps a frenetic pace with vocodered harmonies, while \\"Two Completely Different Things\\" is a midtempo groovy song again with Chic influences. \\"Goodbye To My Dancer\\" is Soul with a Reggae tint, and the upbeat Pop/Soul \\"Hey Floyd\\" also takes a detour into Dub at a point before picking up speed again and ending in a Jazzy coda. This album is like a super rollercoaster ride!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|My name is Taylor James Crawford, I'm a boy and I am 14.  I am also on my dad's account.  Enjoy my review for The Last Song.    Being a big fan of Miley Cyrus even made me love her so much more after watching this great, family movie.  She is an incredible actress in this film and she made the character Ronnie so believable along with the whole rest of the cast.  If you like a tearjerker, this is the movie for you!  The two parts in the film that made me cry was when Ronnie was in the hospital with her dad.  The other part was when he passed away.  Out of all of the movies I've watched in my whole life, this one is now my number one favorite.  I'm glad that most of the reviewers so far love the movie as much as I do!  So far, the average rating for this movie from amazon is 4 stars which is very good, but let's make it 5!    I will love Miley forever!
0374531269|4.0|I listened to this book over the last few weeks and found myself not only captivated by the story of Ishmael Beah's life - but the sing song way that he read the book.  I found some reviewers saying that it was a little difficult to read, and I think it comes from Ishmael's 'story teller' influences (mentioned in the last chapter) that leads to a better listen than a read.  His story telling style begs this book to be listened to - particularly since the author reads the book himself, and thus you can hear his inflection, pauses, and accents.      In terms of the book itself, I found this book to be not only riveting but deeply moving.  If you are the type of person who wants a book to 'get to the point' - this may not be a style for you.  Ishmael tells the story from the prospective of the boy he was when he was living through the civil war in Sierra Leon.  Because of that perspective, you get a lot of minutia of his day to day life on the run from the rebels.  It is well into the book where he mentions being recruited into the military.  From there his escapades over the next three years are less detailed, but no less moving.      I loved the spirit of this book and the resilience the author displayed.  He is truly a hero.

030726999X|5.0|Hi,<br />I try not to write spoilers. I will list a few points I feel are in error w/this book, though. So, don't say I didn't warn you. I came away from this trilogy very impressed.  I believe this was the first effort for Larsson. I only hope he lived long enough to see how successful these three books would be. This last book in the series had the most errors. Even so, it was very enjoyable to read. I do not regret the time spent reading these books. I prefer to keep the images the way I've constructed them in my head, So, I won't watch the films that have been made. Now, to list my nitpicks:<br /><br />1) Salander was shot from behind. The bullet entered her skull behind the left ear, ala Lincoln. A few pages farther into the text. The entry wound is reported to be the left temple. Oops. Further, brain surgery is hairy stuff. A little technical advisement would have helped, here. The surgeon is said to have reached in blindly w/a probe, & widened the wound canal a few millimeters (?!). That's not how it works. Flouroscopy would be utilized, along w/stereotactic instruments to ensure minimal disruption of brain tissue.<br /><br />2) Niedermann is said to have been known to bury his victims alive. Not so, he buried them in pieces.<br /><br />3) Zalachenko & Salander are next door neighbors in the hospital. Zalachenko is ambulatory. Yet, absolutely no security precautions are taken??? W/an attempted murder & felony assault history between the two. Would it not have been more likely that Salander was not left @the mercy of her intended victim? That was absurd.<br /><br />4) When Zala was shot through the head. It was w/a 9mm. Again, Larsson showed his being unfamiliar w/firearms. A 9mm round would have blown through his skull, & kept on going right through the wall. Ditto Gullberg's suicide shot. The three rounds fired through Zala's skull would have blown right through the walls, & into Salander's room. Interior sheetrock walls are thin.<br /><br />5) Blomkvist's using Salander's apartment for his secret research office. This is rather questionable to me. He was no spook. He knew he was under intense surveillance by pros. Yet, what did he do? He \\"Transferred the most crucial documentation to her desktop (PC).\\" He worked @her apt almost every night of the week (\\"Several nights a week.\\"). They would have tracked him sooner or later. I have a hard time w/this one.<br /><br />6) He jammed his middle finger behind the trigger of a Swedish army M/45 sub??? Highly unrealistic confrontation. Is it possible? I looked the weapon up. The gap behind the trigger is very small. He was middle-aged, w/pudgy fingers. Combine that w/the other dynamics of the encounter he cited. Sorry, but it reads as being written by someone w/virtually no weapons experience. When the hitman pulled clear of Blomkvist's initial barrel grab? That would have been it. On the other hand. There is a P-83 Polish Wanad service pistil in 9mm Makarov.<br /><br />7) My final gripe. A nail gun that fires 7\\" nails?! The longest such nails Ive ever seen are 3\\". Seven inches would be ridiculously big. I don't think such a nail gun exists.<br /><br />Even w/this gripes. The book is quite entertaining to read. You won't regret the investment. I see why they have been so popular. The ending kinda left me limp. It had to end some way, though. I'm sure Larsson gave much thought to it. One can see Larsson living vicariously through Blomkvist as a stud muffin journalist who \\"Women want, & men want to be...\\" This aspect proves to be a harmless amusement while reading the story. A very good job, wherever you are, Herr Larsson.research office. This is rather questionable to me. He was no spook. He knew he was under intense surveillance by pros. Yet, what did he do?

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|After watching Predators on Blu-Ray, and being an avid fan of the series I will say that I enjoyed it. Why? The story was borrowed a little from the first one with Arnie (Dutch) Schwarznegger. The acting was so-so, the CGI was cool, and it was a nice throwback to the original with a slight twist. Jungle violence, flayed corpses strewn about, and cloaked predators skewering and blasting the herd of humans caught in the fray. Gimmee popcorn sounds delicious!<br /><br />Eye candy was fun, and the addition of the predator hunting dogs was a nice addition (release the hounds!). When you watch these movies you know there are no Oscars headed their way, you know it is styled for a select audience who enjoys sci-fi and if you go in with any other expectations besides people getting vaporized and shish-ka-bobbed with an occassional face to face toe to toe fight with a predator (a la Yakuza swordsman) then you will set yourself up for disappointment. This moive is fun ride - thats it, acting is mediocre, but still entertaining even with Oscar winner Brody at the lead.<br /><br />Just have fun with it, don't expect to be wow'd or amazed like Avatar, and you may find that it wasn't all that bad after all. Overall the movie is like being in a single's bar - if you wanna have sex, lower your standards and \\"go ugly early\\" you may just get what you want out of it.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|It's a TV series made for entertaining you for 46 minutes a week.  Did it do that?  It did for me.  Was it completely accurate? No, but it was close and sparked an interest in history that made me read up on the era. Good acting, good stories, good entertainment.
0439796644|5.0|War Horse  By: Michael Morpurgo  Fiction-book review     This book is about a young boy named Albert and a strong bond with his horse Joey.  I might want to add it is told in the horse's point of view.  In the beginning, Albert's father went to a horse auction when he was drunk and bought a little beautiful red-roan foal.  When he brought the foal home, immediately his son Albert fell in love with the foal and named him Joey.  Joey wasn't the only horse in the barn, there was another horse named old Zoey. She was old, but she could still pull a plow.  The moment Joey got old enough to be ridden, Albert trained him slowly and gently.  Later on, Albert's father made a bet with another farmer that Joey would be able to pull a plow.  So, Albert started teaching Joey to pull a plow with old Zoey and Joey eventually got to pull the plow himself.  Joey was afraid of Albert's father and kicked him one day. Albert's father was going to get rid of Joey because he kicked him, but Albert begged his father not to get rid of Joey. Finally, Albert was able to convince his father.  One day, the army was looking for recruits for WWI. Albert's father needed money, so he sold Joey to the army for forty pounds.  Albert was in pain losing his best friend and promised Joey they would meet again.  Joey made a friend named Topthorn. He was a black male horse.  They both started on the American's side then they eventually ended up on the British side. Will Joey ever see Albert again?   This personally is the best book I have ever read, but you have to like horses if you really would like to enjoy this book.  This book has action parts during the war, when the guns and bombs were going off. It also has some parts were animals and people die, and I almost ended up balling my eyes out.  There are two down sides, it is a short book and an easy read. I'm a slow reader, and I finished it in about two weeks.    Out of a scale of 1-10, I give this book a ten for the action and the details it uses to describe what is happening. If you liked this book you will love Black Beauty. It is also about a horse and his bond with others and it has splurges of action here and there. Black Beauty is different than War Horse because it doesn't have any war in it and the horse Black Beauty has bonds with many people, not just one. It is also told by the horse's point of view just like War Horse.  Before you begin to read War Horse, I would get a box of tissues for crying and a towel for chewing, for all those moments of anxiety.    Enya

0743454537|4.0|My Sister's Keeper  By Jodi Picoult  Book Review  Family/ Realistic Fiction     My Sister's Keeper is about a family that's falling apart. Kate, the middle child, has leukemia. She wasn't expected to live past her second birthday, but here she is celebrating her sixteenth. Jesse, the oldest child has always been neglected. -Not because his parents don't love him, but because they are so dead-set on keeping Kate alive. Anna, the youngest child in the family, was genetically conceived to harbor the right kind of kidney for Kate whose kidney is busted and if it isn't replaced, she'll die sooner rather that later. Anna, who  has been giving blood, bone marrow and various other body parts since she was about 1 hour old, decides that she doesn't want to give Kate her kidney. She hires a lawyer to help her gain the rights to her own body. She and her lawyer file a petition against her parents. Anna's mom has a degree in law so she decides to be the representative of her and her husband. This book will have you thinking that you know it all, but at the end, be prepared for a slap in the face!   I thought that this book was written very well.-It really keeps you hanging on until the end. Jodi Picoult did a captivating job at really giving her readers an unexpected jolt by making everyone believe one thing when really plotting to make the opposite thing happen. I believe this book to be the saddest book I've ever read due to Jodi's twists in the plot line. It really shows how leukemia can effect not only one person, but a whole community. Whenever Kate had to go into the hospital, I thought it was slightly uplifting how all of the nurses knew Kate's family by name.  They even were occasionally invited to Kate's house for dinner. It made me feel like Kate was safer since she was in a friends hands. Whenever Kate was on the brink of death, all the nurses would get very emotional along with Kate's parents. I liked how each character had their own story that really came togetherat the end. Jodi skipped from character to character in each chapter picking up where she left off. I don't think that I was ever bored in this book which is attributable to Kate always being on the brink of death, Anna's story, and what it was like to mother a child with leukemia.   I would give this book an 8 out of 10 stars because I really liked this book. I thought that it was written cleverly, I liked how astute all the characters were when disparaging each other with all these smart snubs, like when Anna's lawyer was debating with Anna's mom. Anna's mom was sure that Anna would give Kate her kidney, and that they could resolve the problem out of court, but Anna's lawyer was convinced that Anna needed a firm hand to back up her argument of not wanting to give her kidney away.  But unfortunately,  the ending of this book left me feeling crestfallen and heartbroken.     Jodi Picoult always has these exciting court scenes at the end of her books. Like My Sister's Keeper, The Pact, also by Jodi Picoult, has a major court scene and a unrevealed story. In The Pact, it starts right out with the suicide of Emily Gold.    If you liked the close-knit relationship between the two sisters, you should look into the \\"Hunger Game\\" series. Like Kate and Anna, Katniss and Prim are sure one of them will die. Unlike My Sister's Keeper, The Hunger Games has lots of adventure and constant adrenaline rushes.   This well written story really showed me the power of words. I hope I never have to experience what this family had to go through.-The suffering Anna and Kate had to cope with after surgeries, operations,and transplants, and watching Kate get weaker and weaker must have been a slow torture for her parents. Jodi put a lot of detail into how Kate's parents were always so happy for Kate when she had a normal experience that she wasn't expected to live to. For example, Kate wasn't supposed to live to prom, but she made it and her family was euphoric! She got a fancy dress and waseven permitted to get a wig(she had had chemo and had lost all of her hair).   While reading this book, keep a tissue in hand and be prepared for the worst.

0307454541|2.0|I read this for Book Group and though I found it had plenty of depth and it gave me things to talk about in group, I would not however say I enjoyed the book.  I would agree with other reviewers who have noted the fairly blatant lack of moral fiber in the novel.  Call me old fashion, but I don't think overlooking the fact that crime victims going unreported is acceptable.  I just found it down right disturbing.  I for one won't be reading the second or third book.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" is a surprising dark thriller based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, self-described author of \\"country noir\\". The unlikely heroine is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger brother and sister on their dilapidated property in the Ozarks, rural Missouri. She does her best to impart to her siblings the skills they will need to survive on this hardscrabble land with barely enough food to eat and no functional parents. If that weren't hardship enough, the Sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs Ree that her father Jessup, who makes crystal meth, used the family property to guarantee his bail bond...and then skipped bail. If Ree can't find Jessup before his court date, the family will lose its home. So she sets out to track him down and finds herself in a perilous position with no one willing to help.<br /><br />Debra Granik co-wrote this screenplay and directed the film, which was shot in just 24 1/2 days on location in Missouri. The environment is very much a character and a strong presence in every single shot, thanks to cinematographer Michael McDonough. At first I found the unrelenting destitution and hardness heavy-handed, but it seemed natural after a while. The fact that the film takes place primarily outdoors helps. The electrifying focal point is Ree as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She's a young woman with a quiet determination, tough, unsentimental, but somehow confident in her ability to succeed. This spark of optimism is a bit of youthful naivet&eacute; in an otherwise cynical character, but it brings the audience to her like lightning to a rod. Ree is something to hear. It's her voice -what she says, not what she does- that is absolutely captivating.<br /><br />The DVD (Lionsgate 2010): Bonus features include an Alternate Opening (1 ½ min), 4 Deleted Scenes, music credits (text), a theatrical trailer (2 ½ min), and a music video for \\"Hardscrabble Elegy: Composed and Performed by Dickon Hinchliffe\\" (3 min). \\"The Making of Winter's Bone\\" (45 min) is behind-the-scenes footage, rehearsal footage, and includes some deleted scenes. There is no narration, just the clips strung together. There is also an audio commentary by director/co-writer Debra Granik and cinematographer Michael McDonough. They discuss the locations, music, cast, characters, cinematography, and some production design. This is more informative than the \\"Making Of\\" clips.

B00377V6J2|5.0|This 1983 live performance summit meeting between a legend and a soon-to-be legend has been reissued a few times on CD, including a hybrid SACD in 2003 and a remastered CD edition in July 2010. This latest version augments the original eleven audio tracks with video of seven performances, adding \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\\" to the song list. At the time this pair met in a Canadian TV studio, Vaughan was blazing a trail into the blues world with his debut album, [[ASIN:B00000ICN5 Texas Flood]]. King was long since a legend, and though he apparently didn't recognize the name \\"Vaughan,\\" he immediately recognized the young guitarist who'd sat in with him whenever he played in Austin.<br /><br />The video dimension turns this session into a master class for both Vaughan and the viewer. Vaughan is seen soaking up lessons from King's guitar playing, stage manner and the verbal notes he provides between songs. What was previously a musical conversation now becomes a visual one as well. King is often seen marveling - almost in surprise - at Vaughan's playing, and Vaughan's expressions capture the joy he feels in so clearly making the grade. Without a live audience, the two bluesmen play for each other and for the blues. The ease of King's play, the naturalness with which the guitar forms an extension to his soul is awe inspiring. The snippets of dialogue between the CD's tracks have always shown the personal bond that complemented the guitar slingers' artistic connection, but the visuals shed new light on the deep affection they clearly have for one another.<br /><br />King and Vaughan are backed by the former's tack sharp road band, and run through a set drawn mostly from King's catalog. You can hear what was on the horizon, though, as Vaughan rips into his own \\"Pride and Joy\\" with monster tone and a gutsy vocal. Throughout the session the players trade licks and prod each other with solos that quote all the great players from whom they learned. King's influence is clear in Vaughan's playing, but hearing them side-by-side gives listeners an opportunity to hear how the same fundamentals change as they filter through different fingers and hardware. As Samuel Charters points out in one of the three sets of liner notes, Albert King fans will particularly savor the rare opportunity to hear and see him play rhythm guitar. The audio does a nice job of keeping their guitars separated slightly left and right, and the video lets you see exactly who's playing what.<br /><br />As free as both guitarists play, the band, the catalog, and the deference Vaughan shows King all tipped in favor of the latter setting the tempos, leading with his guitar and providing lessons and advice between songs. In any other venue Vaughan would be the master, but here he plays the role of apprentice. How many chances do you get to play with someone who can introduce \\"Blues at Sunrise\\" with \\"This is that thing, uh, I recorded with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin out there at the Fillmore West\\"? It was a good time to be the apprentice, and the addition of songs originally cut from the broadcast (to make room for commercials) notches this package up to five stars. Anyone who loves King, Vaughan or great blues guitar should catch this. [©2010 hyperbolium dot com]ey learned.

0374158460|1.0|I'm usually not a fiction reader but I admit to getting swept up in the buzz and hype of this book (minus the Oprah \\"selection\\"). I ordered it through the library and it took about three weeks before it was my turn to experience the masterpiece.     Something was wrong. Very wrong. I thought it was me until I decided to go on Amazon and read the reviews.     \\"This book is so unbelievably boring that I could barely get through five pages at night before I was knocked out.\\"    At first I wondered if my husband had submitted the aforementioned for me.     I have to say I was surprised that the average was three stars for the book that Oprah built. Usually there are the passionate one-star reviewers who IMO, take out some kind of latent aggression on a poor unsuspecting author or product. But, man, they really seemed to hit on what I have been feeling in secret for two weeks now. My shame and lowliness can now dissipate.     There's also an incredible weight lifted b/c I had nine days to finish the book -- it can't be renewed due to the throngs of people lining up to borrow this tome. But it appears it is just the right amount of time to discover that this book isn't worth the effort of renewing even if it were an option.
B004A2U4V4|4.0|It has been nearly 30 years since Bon Jovi broke out of New Jersey, and have driven many rock fans to tears and cheers. Since then, they've made mostly not just the cornerstones of arena rock that we've seen today, but honestly some of the most timeless songs that are still just as exciting to hear today, as they were back in their success days in the 80's and 90's. Hard to believe, they've still shown that they've got it after those eras as well. But when it has came down to it, they just keep getting better with age not just with new fans, but for those hard core fans who've owned their first copies of Slippery When Wet when they were first released back in the 1986. But, yet witha  soon to be possible induction into the Rock & Roll Hall OF Fame, they have released a pair of hits albums not just to remind new fans and hard core that they weren't just born to follow, they were born to hit home runs.<br /><br />Bon Jovi Greatest Hits: The Ultimate Collection double album is a simple and straight-forward hits collection that delivers mostly well for all-around fans that've loved Bon Jovi through thick and thin. The collection does show it mostly well by including their prime cuts into one nice hits package. The songs have been remastered well, and feel like a new breath of fresh air, ina  industry that stopped making really strong acts, and stronger songs. The Ultimate Collection sums up the over quarter-century that Bon Jovi has delivered with hits like Always, the driven Cruch smash It's My Life, the groups breakthroughs' from the 80's like Wanted Dead Or Alive, Lay Your Hands On Me, and Bad Medicine to just name a few. The collection handles very well, at showcasing the primes of Jon, Richie, Tico and David's strengths of songs, even with some of their most recent songs like We Weren't Born To Follow and Who Says You Can't Go Home. While the collection handles strongly, I was surprised that there were still a few great songs from the group that weren't delivered here like Something For The Pain, Misunderstood & Everyday from 2003's Bounce, and Superman Tonight from last years' The Circle. I was honestly surprised when they included the overshadowed This Ain't A Love Song from 1995's These Days was put into the mix, but some of their other bright gems weren't.<br /><br />Still, despite a few great overlooked tracks, Bon Jovi Greatest Hits: The Ultimate Collection is a great reflection to why Bon Jovi became one of the biggest bands in the world, and took the power ballads for all audiences into the stratosphere. The collection is a great buy for anyone who has never-owned a Bon Jovi album before, or for anyone that wants something a bit of Jon into their MP3 Player, and its still Bon Jovi's life. There have been very few greatest hits albums that've shown to be worth their money that came out this year, and this is honestly one of them. So lay your hands on Bon Jovi: Greatest Hits - The Ultimate Collection.<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+Something For The Pain, Misunderstood & Everyday from 2003's Bounce, and Superman Tonight from last years' The Circle.

0312370849|5.0|I've read many books about Hitler's reign but this one was truly different. It touched my heart on many levels.
B000000OSE|5.0|With the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums Guns N' Roses had to do something very difficult and that is how do you follow up the greatest rock album of all-time. They did it by not trying to make another \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" and that is why the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums are so great.  For me \\"UYI 1 & 2\\" are the two best rock albums of the 90's and sound just as alive and fresh today while almost all the other songs and bands from the 90's sound so painfully dated. To me it is the \\"UYI\\" albums that make GN'R one of the greatest bands of all-time if not the best. On this album you get the hits \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"November Rain\\", and a great version of \\"Live and Let Die\\". Just like \\"UYI 2\\" you get a wide variety of songs, but it all works somehow and just like on \\"UYI 2\\" Izzy Stradlin gets to sing lead on a few songs. The highlights on this album for me are \\"Dead Horse\\" which just flat out rocks and maybe the best song GN'R ever did \\"Coma\\". \\"Coma\\" is an incredible ten minute song to end the album and takes you on quite a ride.
B003O86MY8|4.0|David Garrett is an awesome performer, but more than that, he has a musical genius that is immediately apparent when you play this DVD. I am  beginning a collection of his works because I think they will be a good inspiration for my Granddaughter who is just beginning to play violin. A \\"must hear\\" for Classical music lovers and Rock and Roll affectinados who think they have heard it all !
0061914177|5.0|Gary is an inspiration to us all.  If this Russian dude can do this-I THINK WE ALL CAN CRUSH IT!!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I'm sure all the special features are cool, but why not include them with the \\"2 Disc\\" edition that everyone purchased a few months ago? ...well we all know the answer to that question. I know I'm not shelling out my ca$h into this racket.
B000000OSG|5.0|As I am writing this it has been 19 years since this album came out and it sounds as good today if not better than when it came out. To me this along with \\"Use Your Illusion 1\\" were the two best rock albums of the 90's and have easily stood the test of time especially compared to the other rock bands of the 90's. Guns N' Roses changed their style somewhat from \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" adding a lot more piano to the songs and the songwriting went to another level also. The album starts out with \\"Civil War\\" which is one of the best GN'R songs ever. Other members of the band get to take a shot at lead vocals as well - Izzy Stradlin sings lead on \\"14 Years\\" and Duff sings on \\"So Fine\\". A lot of people don't like the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums because they don't sound like \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" and for me that is what makes them so great and GN'R so great as a band is the ability to do something completely different, but it still sounds incredible. I think as time goes on these will be even more appreciated for how great of albums they are. Songs like \\"Yesterdays\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" are just brilliant and I can't say enough about \\"Estranged\\". \\"Estranged\\" has my favorite lyrics and is my all-time favorite GN'R song. The GN'R version of \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" is easily the best version of the song and it is mainly because of Axl's vocals. Then you have some of the harder rocking songs also like \\"You Could Be Mine\\", \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" and a huge F@#$ You song called \\"Get In The Ring\\" which is classic Axl. The one weak moment is the last song called \\"My World\\", let's just forget that one exists. Overall \\"Use Your Illusion 2\\" has a wide variety and a little bit of everything, but when Guns N' Roses does it they make it work. Truly one of the greatest bands of all-time and arguably the best.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|IM VERY PLEASED! THE STORES WANT 25.00 FOR THIS MOVIE LOOKED AT EVERY STORE.I FOUND IT HERE AND GOT IT IN A FEW DAYS IT WAS LIKE BRAND NEW!! THANKS AGAIN ;0)
B000N3ST7A|2.0|The only good songs on here are \\"Edge of 17,\\" but only the original and not the live version at the end, and \\"Leather and Lace.\\"  That is a duet with Don Henly and is great.  Most of the rest of these songs are live or redone some other way, and they just don't sound as good.  The live version of \\"Rhiannon\\" was especially horrible.
0515142247|3.0|Oh, where to start? I'll simply say that if you want to pass the time and choose reading as your medium, then this is a book that will do just that -- pass the time. This book's title might just be your experience while trying to finish it.    Lee Child creates the ultimate cut and paste \\"man from nowhere/wanderer\\" character and hamstrings him with the inconvenience of a contrived story to reveal just how awesome Jack Reacher really is. He has the mental power of a Jedi (gets numerous humans and beasts to do his bidding many times by simply asking nicely), the sexual magnetism of the typical '80's muscle man (think Arnold or Sly here) and whether or not he wins the day isn't really ever in question. All the villains he's up against are idiots (yet they are smart enough to heist 20 million in bonds, abduct a FBI agent that has contrived relations to the US president, and carve out a niche of territory in Montana).  The ultimate cut and paste hero v. not even decent cut and paste enemies.  No worries, Jack's going to save the day with little more than a torn shirt, a couple of scratches that will not hamper his dramatic \\"left alongside the highway to drift into the sunset amongst the revenge he has just wrought\\" ending. A good read for pubescent males or women in need of their white knight fantasy fulfillment, but for the rest of us schmucks that take our lumps day to day in the real world...Jack is just too much (and I thought Dirk was bad enough). I do respect Jim Grant (Lee Child) though, he admits that all he set out to do was create a fictional character that would sell to the masses in order to make his next house payment due to being terminated. Now, if we could just get an American with the same profile and a decent publicist to do this, then the money we spent on this books might at least go back into the economy here in the U.S.
B003YP7N9O|5.0|Even if I had nearly everything (including a vinyl transfer of the full-length 17), loved the previous remaster, and think the beloved original album gets a little crowded out in this new overstuffed edition.  Nevertheless, I had to have it.  And you probably do, too, if you're reading this.    Presently turning into a pumpkin myself, I'll be back to finish this review later, but the comments I posted on others' reviews pretty much tell the tale.  It's a wonderful package, despite whatever heavy sighs this wrought from those of us who have now purchased this album several times on cd.    And the inside pop-up has been restored : )     Digging the extra banter on the audio DVD.  It's cool, with the menu done up in Stand Up artwork.  There's a long interview with Ian, too, at the end (which is visual, not just audio).    Cornick & Bunker have to be the most underrated rhythm section of all time.  Sabbath had NOTHING on them, in fact, they took more than a little.  Wish Metallica realized that.    The restored THREE MORE FULL MINUTES of jamming on 17 add surprisingly little to the edited version ~ the jam is fun, but not very dynamic....kind of just keeps rolling on.  Still, that's how it was originally played & put out, so it deserved to be restored.  Though previously released in stranger places (now they're home : ), it bears repeating that the BBC versions of New Day Yesterday & Fatman KICK @$$!!    Need to hear it more before I can weigh in, but I think I understand the comment about the \\"brightness\\" of the sound.  Then again, even the MSFL version, to my ears, never really kicked in as powerfully as it should when the opening New Day Yesterday busts in (on its third phrase).  This one does.  Of course, I've never had a good enough stereo to convince me the MSFL sounded much better than the regular CD (it had the pop-up, that's what mattered!).    Ha, I keep adding bits to this non-review....  The Living In the Past mono mix is really worth hearing (for the completists, at least!) ~ the instrumental passage just before the final chorus is very different, and the fadeout flute solo is accompanied by strings high in the mix which almost sound like they're duetting with Ian.  On the standard version, it's Martin's boosted rhythm guitar instead of these strings.  Not to make too much of it, but the sudden diversions from expectation were a pleasant surprise.
B00002DE2L|1.0|I will preface this review by saying that I didn't listen to this album all the way through. I couldn't. It's possible that if I did, my opinion would change, but I doubt it. The thing that turned me off immediately is the thickness and heaviness of the sound. Mutter and the rest of the musicians seem to think that they will die if their bow leaves the string. Therefore, they produce a thick, syruppy sound that sounds nothing like the light, happy Baroque sound that we are used to. I'm sure that some will argue that this unorthodoxy is a good thing, but to me it only makes the music sound heavy and forced. In addition, the vibrato in many spots is so wide as to distort the pitch. Mutter is capable of great music. This is not it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The production is magnificent, follows the book by the letter and respects the history of the time. Must have.  Mr Darcy is the dream of any woman.
0307588335|5.0|As a former LEH-er who \\"bled green\\" I highly recommend this to anyone interested in an insider's view of what really happened at 745 Seventh Ave.
B000TENGUI|1.0|Being a Sneaker Pimps fan and having heard a few of Placebo's songs before (and bought one of their two-disc collection), I had higher expectations for this album.  I simply wanted the \\"Running Up That Hill\\" remake, the last song. I saw how many songs there were in the whole album and that is was only seven dollars as well while just buying the one song would cost me a whole buck anyway. I thought it was an absolute bargain.  So I bought the whole lot.  I feel like I took six dollars and gave it to a bum who in turn walked away peeling off his grungy begging outfit with my money in his pocket.  Duped. Listen to a sample of the songs before you buy. Don't impulse buy Placebo. Their music is for very.. particular tastes.
B003QCCS36|5.0|One of my top 5 favorite voices out there...this guy oozes soul.  Very interesting dude as well...read up on him on Wiki and I think you will appreciate the music even more.
031603438X|4.0|Well it's my second day; I'm down to the last 40 pages. I love them days of reading a book you can't lay down...it's written in a conversational style, as if your having coffee and he's telling you the stories. A lot of these stories you've heard when they were happening in the press. But, he tells you what really happens. The best part for me was his method of composing songs and his relationships with other musicians. To much of the time is dedicated to the misadventures that are drug related. But..hey..that was a big part of his life.   The man and the myth..   A great read and look at the decent price.   Very honest and compelling..you feel like you know him.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Temple Grandin is first and foremost a great movie, but there's so much more to it than just entertainment. It provides a glimpse into how the world is seen by those with Autism, Aspergers, and other Sensory or Developmental Disorders and beautifully depicts a woman not only overcoming it; but thriving because of it. This could have gone horribly wrong, being overly sentimental or too clinical, but the (true) story and the acting were superb.<br /><br />I have recommended Temple Grandin to quite a few people that have or interact with children with Autism, Aspergers, Sensory Integration Disorder or other learning differences and developmental delays. This movie really helped my husband and some of my son's teachers understand and relate to our son who has some similar issues. It did a great job of illustrating the challenges people with differences face without being preachy, inaccurate, patronizing, exaggerated or insulting because the real Temple Grandin is moderately to severely Autistic, but still able to communicate what day to day life with Autism is like very well.<br /><br />My husband and I were both blown away and there aren't many movies that can keep his attention, we were both riveted! Whether you are watching purely for entertainment, because you know someone with Autism Spectrum Disorder, or just to see a unique perspective, you won't be disappointed! It's definitely worth the time and will leave you feeling a little bit better about the world!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The first season of Castle was great, the second season is even better.  No one does it better than Nathan Fillion and the chemistry he has with Stana Katic makes them one of the best couples on TV.  I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes the Hepburn/Tracy banter that was a trademark of their movies.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I'm hooked on Michael Connelly's works.  I've been a fan of Harry Bosch for a while.  Add in Mickey Haller and I might as well reserve the day as I won't put it down.  I couldn't wait to get it and wasn't disappointed once I did.  Another inventive story that is well put together and kept me engrossed throughout.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie has several of my favorite things... Bruce Willis, CIA flavor, lots of action, and a light, humorous tone... I have signed up to be notified when it comes out on DVD... LOVED this movie!
B0026P3G12|5.0|After working all day, I play this CD and it is bliss. What a voice!
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|That was great! I think, of all the Sherlock Holmes' adaptations and movies that I've seen, this one is the most loyal to the original. And it takes place in the present day. One of the things I loved in this one is that it follows Sir Arthur's practice of making London a character. But I digress.<br /><br />The leads are fantastic, Benedict Cumberbatch is a great choice for Holmes. He adopts all of Holmes' mannersisms from the books and stories and he makes them work. Martin Freeman is great as Watson as well. He, like the original, is intelligent, practical, and the perfect foil for the sometimes myopic Holmes. I love the actors they've chosen for Mycroft and Moriarty as well. Especially Moriarty. How great was he? He was perfect. Brilliant and psychotic with widely varying moods and voices.<br /><br />The writing is top-notch. It incorporates a lot of the original source material and the storylines, with just enough variation and modernity to make it interesting to watch. It's also great how they'll incorporate important quotes and events into the script. Where Holmes in the original compares one's mind to a lumber room or an attic, this one will compare his mind to a hard drive. There is enough homage in the script to make it enjoyable for long-time fans but not so much that newcomers to Holmes will be left out. Just fantastic. It's also a lot of fun to watch and I don't think I've giggled or smiled so much during a show in a long time. Well done lads.
B001GNFT1K|3.0|The movie is great, but they do not tell you that the digital copy offer expired a year ago. I already had the movie and only bought this for the digital copy which I still don't have. RIDICULOUS!!!
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|The Amazon Basics line continues to offer good quality items at a fair price; and this HDMI swivel adapter fits the bill.  It's well constructed with no image degradation or artifacts.  The only problem I see with it, is it doesn't create a true 90 degree angle.<br /><br />There's 2 swivel points -- one elbow joint in the middle of the adapter, and another joint near the male plug that moves side-to-side.  And it's the side-to-side joint that doesn't move to a true 90 degree angle; maybe 65 degrees at best.  This might be a minor issue for some, but I really needed both swivel points to move to a 90 degree angle.<br /><br />Bottom Line -- great quality product at a great price, but I wish both pivot points could bend to a 90 degree angle.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|An excellent DVD package of the original series complete with interviews.  William Shatner, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Walter Koenig, and more.  Sound effects are true to the originals and much care was taken to clean up deteriorating tapes.  Subtitles in French and Spanish are provided, but none in English which would help those of us who don't hear as well as we used to!
B0002VEXUA|5.0|The DVD from Oasis-\\"Definitely Maybe\\" is an important product for more reasons than I could list, so I will just write why I am excited about the 2 disc DVD. First there are options for hearing & viewing each song. 1)-You can see/hear the studio version of each tune, 2)-you can see/hear a promotional version of some of the tunes. 3)-You can see/hear a Live version of every tune, 4)- You can see a documentary from the band members of every tune.  Last, the music is fun. The tunes make me manic! I can see why Adam Brooks directed a film derived from this album, its freaking happy music that makes me want to live. The documentary options explain the recording process that Oasis used which for a musician as I am, is interesting and educational. I write music and have been releasing my own vinyl albums since 1985 and I became a fan of the Hollywood film \\"Definitely Maybe\\" for personal reasons-the story is an exact opposite of how my career & life turned out but no regrets. So if I am writing about another band of songwriters it is special. This is a great album and to have the visual options and the audio options are as remarkable as the music. Craig Barr.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|THIS WAS A GIFT TO GO ALONG WITH GONE WITH THE WIND.  SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE BOTH.
B00428CPUY|5.0|I agree with the first reviewer's opinion. However, the Best Buy Exclusive 3 Disc Set has expired. Now, they only have the same 2 DVD version as Amazon. If you can find one available, the bonus third dvd includes 5 extra performances, plus an interview with Eric Clapton. The 3rd Bonus dvd includes Eric Clapton & Steve Winwood's \\"Glad\\", Sheryl Crow's \\"Everday is a Winding Road\\", Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band's \\"Love Has Something Else to Say\\", Gary Clark Jr.'s \\"Don't Owe You a Thang\\", & Citizens Cope's \\"Son's Gonna Rise\\".    As far as the basic 2 dvds go, this is \\"Guitar Heaven\\". Like Buddy Guy states during one of his performances, \\"I don't know how you feel, but I feel like I'm in Heaven\\". I love all of this guitar festival. If you like guitar rock, it doesn't get any better than this. Bill Murray is an excellent host as usual. Plus, the mutual respect and camaraderie amoung the guitarists and musicians is great to see. Plus, there are great commentaries by some of the guitarists themselves. You can tell they are all glad to be there, performing with each other. It's a great atmosphere.    Some of my personal favorites include the performances by Sonny Landreth, from my home state of Louisiana. He plays the guitar in a Louisiana, Cajun/Zydeco style, called \\"Slydeco\\". Also, there's Robert Randolph & The Family Band. Robert is awesome on his pedel steel guitar. I like the tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan \\"Six Strings Down\\" by Jimmy Vaughan and others. I like Hubert Sumlin, he's a living blues legend, and he's still full of passion for the blues. I like ZZ Top, Doyle Bramhall II, & Gary Clark Jr., all from Texas. I like James Burton from Louisiana, on \\"Mystery Train\\" & other songs. James Burton started playing guitar on the Louisiana Hayride Radio Program, when he was 14 years old. He was in Elvis' TCB Band (Taking Care of Business). Also, he was one of the first \\"sidemen\\" inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.    I really enjoyed the Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band's performances, this is their first debut on a dvd, as a reorgainized new band. I love Derek's slide guitar playing. He is a master of the slide guitar, plus Susan is great on guitar, and a great vocalist also. I liked all the collaborations of different musicians playing together. I liked Warren Haynes, Sheryl Crow, Robert Cray, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Ron Wood, Johnny Lang, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and all the rest. I really liked Buddy Guy's perfomances, especially the Stone's \\"Miss You\\", where he breaks a guitar string, and handles it gracefully, and then is handed another guitar. Plus I loved the grand finale, \\"The Thrill is Gone\\", by B.B.King (another living blues legend) & Ensemble.    If you liked the first two EC's Guitar Festival DVD's, then you'll certainly enjoy this one, for sure. These festivals just keep getting better and better. Thanks!!!
0312600844|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this follow-up to \\"The Corrections\\". It was a good book, but not all that easy to read. As someone else posted, each (long) chapter would change from the point of view of one person to another. It wasn't terrible, but as soon as I started caring about one person, the chapter would end and I would be thrust into the world of another person. It wasn't horrible, it just took a little while to adjust to the world of the \\"new person\\". Jonathan Franzen is an amazing writer. I can't wait to see what he does next, and I hope he doesn't wait so long to do it. I am almost reminded of Wally Lamb's last book, \\"The Hour I first Believed\\", that seemed like he was trying to tell about three stories at once, when he would have done better to stick to just one and tell it well. In \\"Freedom\\", I kind of see the same thing in J. Franzen: he had many stories to tell, but he probably should have stuck to just one or two. I would say, \\"read this book\\", but probably don't buy it. Get it from the library.
6304712499|4.0|Very good acting in this thriller with some dark underpinings. Kept my attention right up to the end..... It set a landmark for a new sci fi generation..Enjoyed it!  ....
B00127RAJY|5.0|Got the product so quickly!! It was all great, no problems what so ever!!! I would definitely buy from again!!!!

0307454541|5.0|The first in Stieg Larsson's trilogie translated into English and hit the book market on the exact day Lehman Brothers collapsed. Guess what, in this book, Stieg Larsson says amongst other things:<br />\\"A banker who is speculating haphazardly should resign.\\"<br />\\"A CEO gambling on his company should be thrown into jail.\\"<br />\\"Newspaper men don't criticize speculates and treat them as celebrities.\\"<br />\\"I'm waiting for a correspondent to unveil those who play with national capital just to help out their financial backers and in the process sink nations.\\"<br />It's not an economy classic but rather a breath taking thriller. Never the less, his prophecy put into writing (first into Swedish) years before the collapse of the end of 2008, shows what a literary promise he was and what we've lost when he died just 50 years of age.

B0019MQBJW|5.0|I own just about every SWAN LAKE that has ever been released on home video. This is my current favorite.    It's not a traditional fairy-tale production. The sets are minimal, dark and suggestive. The story has been cunningly tweaked, merging the roles of Benno, the Tutor and Rothbart into a dark composite character (danced by a severe Karl Pacquette) who jealously seeks to control the Prince. Many interpretations are possible, enhancing the ambiguities of the score.    This is the most melancholy flock of white swans imaginable. As Odette, Agnes Letestu combines strong dancing with an almost unbearable sadness and desperation, transforming into an alluring and distinctly feminine Odile. José Martinez (the Prince) is also a superb dancer and partner, but seems emotionally distant and uninvolved until the very end. Perhaps this is intentional.    The ensemble dancing is uniformly excellent, and the character soloists are consistently delightful. The Dance of the Little Swans is a show-stopper.    The performance is given with Acts I-II combined. The \\"swan\\" theme usually played at the end of Act I is omitted, as it's very similar to the version that begins Act II.    The wide 16:9 picture is of demonstration quality, razor-sharp and highly detailed, doing full justice to the beautiful costumes and deeply saturated lighting effects. The camera work is mostly unobtrusive and favors wide views, making the few closeups even more effective. Blu-ray brutally reveals the sweat on the dancers. These people sure work hard.    The BEST part of this disc is the soundtrack. It is no exaggeration to say that it's worth buying even if you turn off the picture!    In addition to my video collection, I own about three dozen vinyl and CD recordings of SWAN LAKE. This performance/recording blows nearly all of them away. Except for Dorati '54 (which is monaural), I have never heard a better sense of musical proportion and orchestral balance applied to this repertoire. The dynamics andrubato have a \\"just right\\" feeling that makes me smile with satisfaction. Tempos are thoughtful, often slower than usual, bringing out details in the arrangement that are easy to miss. Nearly all repeats are observed. The 5.1 surround recording is vivid and transparent, with a front soundstage that is impressively wide and deep. Even without headphones, you can pinpoint every instrumental group in space. The solo violin is RIGHT THERE. Stage noise is minimal. Only the applause keeps this from being a perfect reference recording; but you can hardly blame the audience for its enthusiasm!    Speaking as a certified SWAN LAKE junkie, this disc earns the highest recommendation.
0394818237|3.0|I bought this book because we love Rotraut Susanne Berner's In the Town All Year Round and Scarry's book looked like it was based on a similar concept (heavy on the pictures with a light story line and lots of opportunity for readers to interpret and re-interpret the story through multiple readings). Scarry's book has charming illustations with some sweet and funny little background stories, but the content is dated.   It's hard for me to read this book with my preschool aged daughter, as the gender roles are circa 1950 (e.g the Dr. is male, all the firefighters are male, the nurse is female, the secretary is female, and most of the other female characters are moms at home).  Nevertheless, she enjoys it and I just change \\"workmen\\" to \\"workers\\" and \\"firemen\\" to \\"firefighters\\" as I'm reading!   In short, however, I would highly recommend In the Town All Year Round over this book.
B003YY8KF6|4.0|I have always liked Nora Jones.  Her voice has always sort of soothed my soul!  I was able to listen to this album pre-release and am really liking it!  It is different than her past albums in the sense that this is a compilation of songs made in the last ten years with other well-known, legendary singers like Ray Charles, Outkast, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and others!  What's not to like when you get to hear such a variety of music and such great duets.  There is something for everyone here.  The diversity of this album is great!  If you like the bluesy music, it's there.  Like jazz?  It's there?  Like something a little more upbeat and rappy?  Look no further than this album.  Many genres are represented and I'd be surprised if someone couldn't find a song they loved!  There are definitely some songs I like more than others (I'm more into the jazzy or bluesy sound) but overall I'm really happy with the sound of this album.  Give it a listen, it will be *good* music to your ears!
B00382S9V4|4.0|**This is a review of the stand-alone Blu-ray release, not the Blu-ray/DVD combo set**<br /><br />I love a good heist film, and the heist sequences in this film are certainly fun to watch.  Where this film is weakest, however, is during scenes that thrust Rene Russo into the \\"sexy femme\\" spotlight.<br /><br />Former fashion model Russo is a competent but unexceptional actress.  Too many of her scenes, in particular her scenes in the police department and in the see-through evening gown, are presented with a rather heavy hand.  There might as well have been a big neon sign overhead that read \\"This is where we focus on Rene's character's sexual aggressiveness and power\\".  Not a hint of subtlety.  Very heavy-handed and, as a result, distracting.  Those are the weakest scenes in the movie.  She is very much objectified, presumably for the sake of having a \\"hot over-40 woman\\" angle to \\"sex up\\" the movie as a selling point.  And if you remember the pre-release marketing for this film, that is EXACTLY what the focus was on.<br /><br />As a tribute to the original version of TTCA, Faye Dunaway appears in the small and ultimately unimportant role of Thomas Crown's psychiatrist.  Dunaway's psychiatrist even mocks and laughs at Crown in one scene, a HUGE no-no in the psychiatric community.  All it shows it that her character was thinly written and conceived from the start.  Her character serves no real purpose to the story except as an unnecessary framing device and to satisfy some stunt casting.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the movie's most believable character is the police detective played by Denis Leary.<br /><br />Much attention was given to the love scenes between Brosnan and Russo's characters.  The first one took place largely on a marble floor and marble staircase.  It was meant to be hot and sweat-inducing, but all I could think of during that scene was how uncomfortable it must be to engage in that act on cold, hard marble.<br /><br />I saw the film in the theaters in 1999 and mostly enjoyed it.  As I said, I enjoy a good heist flick.  But I forgot that the heist itself was just a small part of a much longer film, and that the rest of the film has to have some sustainability to it.<br /><br />Watching it again in 2010 on the bargain-priced Blu-ray I purchased from a big box store, it was much less enjoyable.  When the \\"will it work or won't it?\\" question of the heists has already been answered in the first viewing, it shifts a larger load to the rest of the film:  is it solidly enough made/written to carry the viewer along for the other parts of the ride?  In many instances, no.<br /><br />And some of the product placement was less-than subtle too.  That can often be distracting too.<br /><br />For the film itself and the fact that the Blu-ray is a bare-bones edition with no extra features  (not even the director commentary that is included on the regular DVD), I give it 3 1/2 stars.

We are treated to an all-star cast featuring the likes of Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro. The storyline is well-written and the characters are quite charming, evil and stupendous. The special effects are outstanding and I must say that I loved watching every single minute of this fantastic fantasy movie. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.

The video is filmed in a living room and it's just you and Erin. The video has a very personal feel to me. Erin O'Brien even has to run off to pee (I'm sure it's staged but it's cute and I like it).

The folks at Disney and Pixar are getting better and better, not only in the art of animation, but also actually transmitting true emotions though their films. This is precisely what I felt when I watched the delightful \\"Toy Story 3,\\" which I believe is the best of the series so far. And its gets better if you watch it in its amazing Blu-ray edition.    This time, we find out that Andy grew up and is not a kid anymore. In fact, he is now heading for college. As you can imagine, Woody and the gang are worried about their future. Andy's mother tells him to think what he wants to do with his toys, and he decides to take Woody to college with him and store the rest of the toys, including Buzz Lightyear, in the attic. This apparently is a good solution that would make everybody happy. Unfortunately, last minute distractions cause the toys to be sent to the feared Sunnyside Daycare center, in which other kids were going to play with them. However, our friends' fears disappear once they find out that the kids there love their toys. Lotso (a stuffed bear), the toys' leader at the center, reassures them that they everything was going to be all right. But very soon after their arrival, the gang realizes that things are not like they imagined.     \\"Toy Story 3,\\" I believe, conveys a stronger message about friendship and love that the previous installments. This is great entertainment for all the family. The fantastic Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy package is loaded with goodies, including many features about the making-of of the film, interactive games, trivia material, studio stories, and much, much more.

0807014273|5.0|Millions of people have bought Man's Search for Meaning.<br /><br />It's author, Victor Frankl, saw that, not simply in terms of the book's success, but in terms of the emptiness that so many people must be feeling.<br /><br />During his lifetime, Victor Frankl (1905-1997) held two simultaneous professorships at the University of Vienna Medical School: Professor of Neurology and Professor of Psychiatry. He is most commonly thought of as the founder of \\"logotherapy,\\" the third \\"Viennese School of Psychotherapy,\\" Freud and Adler being earlier founders of psychoanalytic and individual psychology respectively.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK:<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts. The preface to the first edition is by Gordon W. Allport (1897-1967), at the time of the first edition, former professor of psychology at Harvard. Allport was chiefly responsible for the spread of Frankl's logotherapy within the U.S.[1]<br /><br />The preface to the 1984 edition is by Frankl himself. In that preface, Frankl explains the relationship between the two parts of the book. The first half is a story of life in a concentration camp and serves as the existential validation of the second, theoretical half of the book, which is Frankl's introduction to \\"logotherapy.\\"<br /><br />In the first half, Frankl relates some of his own experiences during World War II, during which he spent time in three concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. He divides the first half of the book according to the three phases of life he and others experienced in their internment in the camps: (1) the initial shock of camp life, (2) the routine of camp life, and (3) the experience and aftermath of freedom. Highlights are as follows:<br /><br />From the beginning, camp life is dominated by a sociological structure made up of Capos (collaborators who rule over other prisoners), other prominent prisoners (e.g., cooks, storekeepers, doctors, nurses, and camp policemen), foremen, wardens, and theSchutzstaffel (SS). At the bottom are ordinary prisoners. Despite the hierarchy and the evil it represents, no group is entirely villainous. Humanity is made up of two \\"races\\" --  the decent and the indecent --  and they are found at every level. The mere fact that a person is a member of a particular group does not indicate to which \\"race\\" he may belong.<br /><br />At first, prisoners experience hopelessness mixed with \\"delusions of reprieve.\\" Homesickness and nostalgia are intense. Abnormal responses to abnormal circumstances are pervasive and entirely normal. Everything conspires to eliminate the basic humanity of victims --  yet some manage to rise above the downward pull of bestial circumstances. But sadly, as Frankl says, \\"the best of us did not survive.\\"<br /><br />As camp life becomes routine, grim humor and cold detachment take hold. The world outside the prison camp becomes unreal. The torture of others no longer provokes sympathy or revulsion. Apathy and the blunting of emotions become functional in making inmates insensitive to routine beatings. The sole task becomes survival. For most inmates, inner life is reduced to its most primitive state. Lack of sleep, lack of food, sickness, mistreatment, and hard labor amplify irritability. Violence begets violence among those who are routinely violated. Food dominates dreams and conversation. A few even resort to cannibalism. Yet politics and religion remain topics of intense conversation. Inmates still join each other in appreciating the beauties of nature. Amazingly, art and entertainment still survive, while sexual deviancy is strikingly absent in their all-male environment.<br /><br />The most telling influence of all is the \\"provisional existence\\" inmates experience in not knowing if or when their confinement will end. Psychic time runs counter to actual time. Days seem to last forever, but weeks pass quickly.<br /><br />In the midst of it all, some inmates manage to maintain an inner hold that helps them rise above their degrading environment. In so doing, they bear witness to the reality of human liberty despite the unimaginable constraints of camp life. In the worst of circumstances, humans still have a choice. Present existence can still have meaning in the face of profound and unavoidable suffering. Opportunities and challenges are continually present. It is always possible to make something positive of life --  even life in a concentration camp. In Frankl's words, \\"it does not really matter what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.\\" In contrast, those who lose faith in their future are doomed.<br /><br />Liberation from camp life has its own dangers. Surprisingly, it does not come with overwhelming gladness, but with timidity and with depersonalization. Prisoners have to relearn joy. The sudden release of enormous mental pressure puts inmates at risk of moral and spiritual deformity. Liberty does not mean the prisoners do not need spiritual care. The oppressed have almost irresistible temptations to become oppressors. Bitterness comes from disappointed expectations of how great release would be. The dreams that kept prisoners going in the dark days of imprisonment clash with the reality of loved ones who no longer exist. Disillusionment comes when inmates learn that suffering does not cease. Eventually the experience of camp life becomes unreal --  more like a nightmare than something that really happened. But in the end, former inmates have the comforting realization they have nothing left to fear except their God.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning differs from Frankl's original intention in two important respects. He originally intended only to write the first half of the book as an anonymous account, content simply to have his unattributed experiences of deepest suffering demonstrate the possibility of finding meaning in life despite the worst of circumstances. His friends, however, convinced him to add his name as author and his publisher requested he add a description of the basic tenets of logotherapy and a bibliography, the former of which constitutes Part II of the present work. The 1984 edition addresses more recent concerns in a postscript entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\"<br /><br />REFLECTIONS:<br /><br />Logotherapy provides deep insight into the basic nature of humanity. Its tenets are so easily taken for granted that Frankl's contribution seems to be, not so much as telling people something new, but more for articulating so well what they knew all along. The idea that humans cannot survive without meaning has explanatory power that can hardly be questioned. As Frankl says, \\"suffering ceases to be suffering once it has meaning.\\" And to paraphrase him, suffering is not a prerequisite to meaning, but meaning can be found even in suffering.<br /><br />Logotherapy is valuable in highlighting absence of meaning as a common source of psychological problems. Frankl is astute in seeing meaninglessness as the motive behind destructive pursuits of pleasure and the constant need for more and more entertainment.[2]  There is little doubt that boredom,[3]  depression, aggression, and addiction[4]  are often traceable to a loss of meaning. It is useful to see such problems as possibly arising, not from psychodynamics, but from Frankl's \\"noodynamics\\" and the \\"existential vacuum\\" that meaninglessness entails. Frankl's examples of how quickly aggression within a group is \\"cured\\" by a collective task and how rapidly depression gives way in the face of new meaning to life are compelling. He is right in observing that people may have the \\"means to live,\\" but they are in deep trouble if they do not have a \\"meaning to live.\\" Most people will agree (although they may not act accordingly) that happiness cannot be obtained by pursuing it directly. Rather, as Frankl points out, it must ensue as an unsought consequence of pursuing something else.<br /><br />Logotherapy provides a useful counterpoint to much of Freudian psychology. Freud predicted starvation would reduce people to an identical urge. But Frankl found that starvation heightened the distinctions among individuals rather than diminishing them. Freudian psychology equates length of treatment with the depth of cure. But logotherapy suggests the possibility of deep and lasting benefits from the shortest of consultations. Freud sought cures in introspection and retrospection. But logotherapy finds answers to problems by looking outside oneself and to the future. Freud saw the deepest motive of humans as a \\"will to pleasure.\\" But logotherapy sees the most basic need as a \\"will to meaning.\\"[5]  Freud saw inner tension as a problem in itself. But logotherapy sees inner tension as healthy in leading to the resolution of existential frustration through the discovery of meaning in individual situations. Freud provided modernism's third blow to human dignity[6]  in challenging human free will. But logotherapy holds that humans always have a choice.<br /><br />Frankl is a realist and an optimist in arguing that, although humans are not free from circumstances, they are free to take a stand against circumstances. He is provocative in asserting that no circumstances exist that can rob humans of all freedom. He opposes reductionist understandings of humanity in affirming the main characteristic of humans as the ability to rise above determinants --  determinants that Freudian psychology would find insurmountable. As Frankl says, \\"man invented the gas chambers, but it was also man who entered those chambers with head held high.\\"<br /><br />On the surface, Frankl's assertion of the \\"unconditional meaningfulness of life\\" sounds troubling in apparently asserting meaningfulness for all choices, good and evil. The phrase is best understood, however, in opposing nihilism, which asserts that nothing has meaning. Frankl would probably say that even bad choices have significance --  how much more the good ones!<br /><br />Frankl correctly points out that humans find meaning in three kinds of choices: (1) through deeds or actions, (2) through encounters with something or someone, and (3) through their attitudes toward unavoidable suffering. The latter is most important in religious matters because it is the fact of suffering that calls God's goodness or even His existence into question.[7]  For religious people, the personal meaning of particular situations is inseparable from the meaning of those same situations to God. For them, the search for meaning is the pursuit of what God intends in a particular circumstance.<br /><br />So Frankl's denial of any absolute meaning for a given situation may be a bit problematic for religious people who are accustomed to thinking of one big divine Master Plan that comprehends and judges every decision. That apparent dilemma can be resolved, however, by appreciating the radical nature of human freedom. True righteousness does not mean choosing the one right course of action out of a multitude of wrong ones, but rather pursuing one choice out of many equally good choices with an attitude of faith.[8]<br /><br />Of course, non-religious people need logotherapy too. Logotherapy is well-suited to an increasingly secular Western world where psychiatrists are increasingly encountering, not cases of disease, but questions of meaning. Unfortunately, many psychiatrists have been educated, as Frankl notes, into a philosophy of nihilism, which they in turn pass on to their patients with tragic results. They are also wrongly trained to see human beings as \\"brain machines.\\" They are too inclined to debunk that which is truly human in terms of it being simply a mask or facade for subconscious mechanisms.[9]  So logotherapy provides a needed corrective for both secular patients and their secular care-givers in its \\"re-humanizing\\" of psychology.<br /><br />Frankl disavows any dogmatism in logotherapy. Although Jewish, he easily speaks of \\"crosses to bear.\\" Frankl's eclectic impulse is evidenced in his adoption of techniques that have no necessary connection to logotherapy itself. An example would be \\"pseudo-orientation in time\\" --  a strategy of clarifying decision making by adopting a future stance looking back on a present decision. Another would be \\"paradoxical intention\\" --  a treatment of disorders (e.g., stuttering, insomnia) by intentionally trying to incite them (hyper-intention). A third would be \\"dereflection\\" --  a treatment for hyper-reflection and hyper-intention.<br /><br />One of Frankl's most intriguing thoughts is his assertion that man is most human when focused on something outside himself. Couple that notion with the idea that man is made in the image of God and the result fits perfectly with the self-emptying nature of Christ in the \\"kenosis hymn\\" in chapter 2 of Philippians. Moreover, it should not be surprising that the good theology of Philippians 2 finds expression in physicalities of God's good creation. For we see humans who are made in the image of God endowed with the same kenotic impulse --  the same need to empty themselves for the sake of something outside themselves. Achieving that transcendence is healthy. Failing it is dysfunctional.<br /><br />Compared to existentialists in general, Frankl is more optimistic, less nihilistic, and more accommodating to the notion of God than most. But his is an odd form of existentialism in those respects. Existentialism and traditional Christianity do not mix very well. Existentialists say, \\"existence comes before meaning\\" --  i.e., no meaning exists until humans create it. Christianity says just the opposite -- \\"meaning comes before [human] existence\\" --  God has imposed a meaning on human life in advance of human existence. Therein lies the friction. Frankl, like all existentialists, comes down on the side of the notion that humans create \\"the good\\" by choosing. A better, Christian alternative is the idea that the real choice for humans is not whether \\"to create 'the good' by choosing\\" but rather to \\"to enter into 'the good' God has already chosen.\\"<br /><br />Present-day preoccupation with the \\"search for meaning\\" is a rather recent development. Gerhard Sauter[10] thinks it comes from the loss of a common story that religion, tradition, law, and community once provided. In times past, people did not have to \\"give meaning\\" to their lives because their shared understanding of past, present, and eternity had already done so in advance. Many people today, however, have no \\"story\\" but the one they create for themselves --  thus the prevalence of Frankl's existential vacuum. The answer to that vacuum is to discard the credo of individualism and return to the biblical story shared within a biblical community.<br /><br /> -- Bill Brewer<br />[...]<br /><br />NOTES:<br /><br />[1]  See the publisher's note beneath the preface.<br /><br />[2]  Readers should consider Richard Winters' book,Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment, for a Christian psychiatrist's view of the symptoms, causes, and cures of existential emptiness.<br /><br />[3]  Use of entertainment to alleviate boredom avoids the hard task of making sense of life. Use of drugs to dull existential frustration in the depressed does the same thing. Logotherapy would work on the problem by creating tension in the life of the bored and the depressed, not resolve it. Frankl's illustration in this regard of fortifying an arch by putting more weight on it is a good one.<br /><br />[4]  Frankl's belief that the libido runs wild in the presence of an existential vacuum matches everyday observation.<br /><br />[5]  Frankl says the search for meaning is primary --  it is not simply a rationalization for Freudian hydraulic forces operating within the subconscious.<br /><br />[6]  Copernicus argued that humans were not at the center of the universe. 2. Darwin argued that humans were not different from the animals. 3. Freud argued that humans are not even in control of their ownminds.<br /><br />[7]  Suffering is especially good at exposing an existential vacuum that might otherwise remain hidden.<br /><br />[8]  Of course there are moral boundaries, but they are not necessarily narrow.<br /><br />[9]  Frankl is superb in noting, \\"'I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my 'defense mechanisms,' nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my 'reaction formations.' Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!'\\"<br /><br />[10] Gerhard Sauter,The Question of Meaning: A Theological and Philosophical Orientation, trans. and ed. by Geoffrey W.

Compared to existentialists in general, Frankl is more optimistic, less nihilistic, and more accommodating to the notion of God than most. But his is an odd form of existentialism in those respects. Existentialism and traditional Christianity do not mix very well. Existentialists say, \\"existence comes before meaning\\" --  i.e., no meaning exists until humans create it. Christianity says just the opposite -- \\"meaning comes before [human] existence\\" --  God has imposed a meaning on human life in advance of human existence. Therein lies the friction. Frankl, like all existentialists, comes down on the side of the notion that humans create \\"the good\\" by choosing. A better, Christian alternative is the idea that the real choice for humans is not whether \\"to create 'the good' by choosing\\" but rather to \\"to enter into 'the good' God has already chosen.\\"    Present-day preoccupation with the \\"search for meaning\\" is a rather recent development. Gerhard Sauter[10] thinks it comes from the loss of a common story that religion, tradition, law, and community once provided. In times past, people did not have to \\"give meaning\\" to their lives because their shared understanding of past, present, and eternity had already done so in advance. Many people today, however, have no \\"story\\" but the one they create for themselves --  thus the prevalence of Frankl's existential vacuum. The answer to that vacuum is to discard the credo of individualism and return to the biblical story shared within a biblical community.      -- Bill Brewer   [...]    NOTES:    [1]  See the publisher's note beneath the preface.    [2]  Readers should consider Richard Winters' book,Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment, for a Christian psychiatrist's view of the symptoms, causes, and cures of existential emptiness.    [3]  Use of entertainment to alleviate boredom avoids the hard task of making sense of life. Use of drugs to dull existential frustration in the depressed does the same thing. Logotherapy would work on the problem by creating tension in the life of the bored and the depressed, not resolve it. Frankl's illustration in this regard of fortifying an arch by putting more weight on it is a good one.    [4]  Frankl's belief that the libido runs wild in the presence of an existential vacuum matches everyday observation.    [5]  Frankl says the search for meaning is primary --  it is not simply a rationalization for Freudian hydraulic forces operating within the subconscious.     [6]  Copernicus argued that humans were not at the center of the universe. 2. Darwin argued that humans were not different from the animals. 3. Freud argued that humans are not even in control of their own minds.    [7]  Suffering is especially good at exposing an existential vacuum that might otherwise remain hidden.     [8]  Of course there are moral boundaries, but they are not necessarily narrow.     [9]  Frankl is superb in noting, \\"'I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my 'defense mechanisms,' nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my 'reaction formations.' Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!'\\"    [10] Gerhard Sauter,The Question of Meaning: A Theological and Philosophical Orientation, trans. and ed. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), passim.
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|After the successful run of \\"Open Water,\\" a small-budget and smart film in which the main characters are subjected to unimaginable situations in real life, it was expected that some moviemakers would think about similar scenarios to tell a good, frightening story. \\"Frozen\\" follows this pattern, and brings us another gruesome and penetrating story that will surely stay with you for some time after you leave the theater.     Joe (Shawn Ashmore), Dan (Kevin Zegers), and Parker (Emma Bell), Dan's girlfriend, are three friends that decide to go skiing during the weekend. However, the weather is getting worse, and it's not such a good idea to do so after all. But they insist. For their apparent good luck, they manage to convince the gatekeeper of the mountain lift, who warned them about the incoming storm, to allow them to have one more ride. The gatekeeper tells them that he would grant them one more ride only, and they happily accept. Everything is going well until, you guessed, due to a tragic mistake, the mountain lift stops in the middle of nowhere, and they are stranded in their chair lift, about fifty feet high from the ground. Once they realize that the chair was not moving anymore, they try to figure out a way to get help. They have to think and take action fast, because it is dark, cold, and the storm is on the way. Add to this the fact that it is Sunday night and the ski resort would be closed for the next five days. Ah, and there are hungry wolves on the ground, too. Mix these ingredients and you have a rollercoaster of fear.     Ably directed and written by Adam Green, \\"Frozen\\" is ingenious, captivating and scary. It puts you on the spot, and makes you ask yourself what you would do if you were ever caught in that situation. The remarkable Blu-ray edition of the film features audio commentaries by Green, Ashmore, Zegers, and Bell, as well as cinematographer Will Barratt and editor Ed Marx. It also includes deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and more. (USA, 2010, color, 93 min plus additional material)    Reviewed on November 8, 2010 by Eric Gonzalez exclusively for [...]

B003VS0CX8|5.0|The wait for the Blu-ray edition is over, and it's absolutely captivating.  So many of the key scenes in the movie rely on the play between light and shadow.  It's all rendered masterfully in this release.  You will see sumptuous details in the clothing, the paintings, the wallpaper, the stonework that you may never have noticed before in the dreamier but muddier versions all awash in pink and pale green.  The soundtrack is lively and vibrant as others have noted.  Well done!
B004B8RWX0|4.0|I loved the comic book series and really want to like this show.    Lorie is too timid, too thin, and has too weak of a persona so far.  In addition, all the drama with the locket was silly and would have killed it (plus I don't think anyone has obnoxious lockets like that in the last couple of generations).  Another thing is that the camp is way too spread out...they need to be closer together for safety (same with the thing in the woods-- there is no way, they were doing it in the tent where it made more sense in the comic book).  Glen wouldn't be panic-ed making death comments about climbing a ladder; he had more guts and liked what he did (the thrill/adrenaline -- he doesn't seem to have it here).    There are also characters that I don't remember, and I'm not a big fan of the racism/sexism that they added in.  Also, Rick shouldn't have taken leadership by force -- especially so early like now, because he is way behind the others on the learning curve of what is going on (having just woken up and shown up), and beating up one of a group (even if the guy isn't well liked) is stupid because you are the outsider so they are less likely to trust you and more likely to do something to you for it.  Everyone stands around so one guy can chop up a body..and the little stupid things go on and on.  There are just too many little things that I don't like for me to enjoy the show the way I'd want to.

B002S8AGZG|4.0|Ok, this review is simply to let people know of the one GLARING flaw for fans of the original theatrical release of the film.'10 Things' is a great classic 90s teen movie filled with quick wit, great comic timing and lovable characters... BUT there are a couple of scenes that are CENSORED from the original theatrical release back in the late 90's. That's right, this is a partially censored version of the film.     When this film was released for television viewing a couple of years after its release, there was a scene where the main protagonist Cameron is sitting on the benches of the soccer field with his friend William towards the beginning of the film, and upon seeing that the Kat Stratford character is not willing to go out with Patrick (the late Heath Ledger's character) Cameron states \\"we're screwed... we're SCREWED!\\"   The problem here is that in the original theatrical release of the film the actual line is \\"we're f*****d.... we're F*****d!\\"   On top of this, there is a scene in the opening of the film where Cameron's character is meeting with the office administrator as she is writing her exotic novel, she walks over to the window and warns the Cameron character about a group of kids at school she refers to as \\"s***heads,\\" but it is apparent that in the transfer there was some overdubbing and the word does not come out clear. While this MAY have been the original line of the film, it is questionable, but there is definite dubbing at that line.    While the film is still as stellar as ever, just know that somewhere along the way in the transfer they seemed to not have been able to get the original theatrical release to remaster into High Def, therefore probably used a newer censored version of the film and remastered that instead. Considering I'm very big on director originality, I hate dubbed and censored versions of films, and most hardcore film buffs would feel the same, so it is best you know that before you purchase this film. I would recommend that ifyou want the original theatrical release of the film to go and pick up and older DVD copy.   Other than that, the transfer is very clean and great looking, the audio is well balanced and also remastered well. The \\"10 years later\\" special feature also doesn't actually feature ANYTHING from the actors 10 years later, but all cast interviews are from when the film was released. The only interviews taken from the 10-years-later perspective were the film's director, casting agent and writer. Kind of a bummer, it would have been awesome to hear from the original cast 10 years later.     Thus for these flaws I have to take a star away from the review.

When I came back to watch this show, I just rent one of them, to see if I give a chance, and that was it, I have to see them all. Great job, really nice version of the two kind of vampire tales.

1439152780|5.0|INTRODUCTION: Last year more or less by chance, I opened the author's 2008 (UK/US) debut The House at Riverton originally published in Australia as The Shifting Fog (2006). I was hooked from the first page and the novel has become a big time favorite. Her somewhat similar second novel The Forgotten Garden made a bit less of an impression on me - I read it back to back with The House at Riverton and I should have left some time to pass in-between so maybe a reread is in order, but any new Kate Morton novel has become a big asap and of course I ordered \\"The Distant Hours\\" for its UK publication date last month, though I decided to have the review for its publication here in the US.    FORMAT/CLASSIFICATION: \\"The Distant Hours\\" stands at about 575 pages divided into five named parts, a prologue from The True History of the Mud Man and an epilogue. The action alternates between Eddie's narration in 1992 and the events of 1941 narrated in third person from the three Bltyhe' sisters POV's, while the even more distant past of their father's fateful actions and decisions is slowly peeled apart too.    So as a ghostly shadow hovering over the novel, there is the celebrated writer Raymond Blythe whose dark children's book The True History of the Mud Man excerpted in the prologue, has appeared out of nowhere towards the end of the Great War in 1918 to propel him to fame and wealth after he seemingly had forsaken writing following the tragic 1910 fiery death of his first wife, the twins' mother.    \\"The Distant Hours\\" is modern literary Gothic and as close to sff as it gets without any element of the supernatural.    OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: \\"The Distant Hours\\" starts innocuously when a fifty year old letter finally makes its way to Meredith Burchill and her daughter is intrigued and banters with her about the war years when the 13 year old working class Meredith, evacuated in 1939 from London to the countryside, is picked up by the imperious 17 year old Juniper Blythe to live with her and her 33 year old twin sisters at the Milderhurst Castle. What Eddie does not know at the time is how important those years have been for her mother...    Because in 1939, Meredith gets so well on with the eccentric and talented Juniper who has been groomed for a literary career by her now recluse and decrepit father, that she refuses to return to London and her parents until Spring 1941. Meredith also sort-of introduces Juniper to her handsome teacher Tom Carvill - her secret first crush - only for the two to fall in love and prepare to marry. Feeling herself abandoned by Juniper when the important missing letter does not arrive in London 1941, Meredith assumes Juniper married Tom and forgot all about her and she puts the past behind... Until now.    Eddie has her problems too - dumped by her well off longtime boyfriend who gave her as a parting gift a six month lease on their expensive London apartment, she now needs to move since she cannot afford it anymore, but as an editor at a cottage publisher she wants to stay close to her work, so she temporarily camps out in her boss and surrogate \\"old uncle\\" Herbert's living room, without of course telling a thing to her family... When a countryside job and a chance road sign with \\"Milderhurst 3 miles\\" on it happen, Eddie is intrigued but on arriving at the castle's gate she remembers stopping by as a child with her mother, so she realizes that the letter is way more important for her mother than she thought, so she decides to nose around a bit. And so it starts...    \\"The handle was black and smooth, shaped like a shin bone and cool beneath my palm. Indeed, a general coldness seemed to leach from the other side of the door; though how, I couldn't tell.  My fingers tightened around the handle, I started to twist, then--  `We don't go in there.'  My stomach, I don't mind saying, just about shot through the roof of my mouth.  I spun on my heel, scanned the gloomy space behind. I could see nothing, yet clearly I wasn'talone. Someone, the owner of the voice, was in the corridor with me. Even if she hadn't spoken I'd have known: I could feel another presence, something moving and hiding in the drawing shadows. The rustling was back now, too: louder, closer, definitely not in my head, definitely not mice.\\"    \\"The Distant Hours\\" has four main strengths. It is a Kate Morton novel, so nothing is quite as it seems, secrets abound, twists and turns galore and there were one or two that truly surprised me since while I could dimly see where the book goes and have an inkling of its general thrust, the author still managed to smoothly drop a bomb or two...    The atmosphere is pitch perfect - a combination of suspense and waiting for the momentous with little domestic details, present day happenings and other mundane stuff. Alternating between \\"holding your breath\\" and relaxing, \\"The Distant Hours\\" keeps one turning page after page and while it has a clear and definite conclusion, I strongly regretted that it ended since I could happily have read another 575 pages.    \\"The Distant Hours\\" also has the fascinating characters one expects from Kate Morton. The likable, \\"girl next door\\" Eddie, her somewhat distant mother of unexpected secrets and of course the three Blythe sisters: strong Percy, delicate Saffy and very talented but highly strung Juniper come out fully alive in the pages of the novel and they are quite unforgettable. Though seen only in the background and through the eyes of others, Raymond Blythe is as important a character as any, though for the why and the how you have to read the book.    Where \\"The Distant Hours\\" shows a marked improvement over the first two Kate Morton novels is in the interpersonal-relationships between the characters which are very complex and tangled. With its back and forth in time-line and events, the novel's tapestry takes a while to assemble, but the page turning style of the author hides this so well, that when you start getting the \\"big picture\\",you wonder how she sneaked all the details that seemed so innocuous before...    \\"The Distant Hours\\" (A++) is a superb novel of literary suspense that delivered all I expected from it and more, fully justifying my very high expectations and huge excitement when I found out about it not that long ago.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter season 2 picks up where season 1 left off. After seeing season 1 you may think that it's going to be impossible to follow that or even outdo it. But to the shock of me and almost everyone else season 2 does the impossible and is better than season 1. For those of you who don't know, Dexter is a series that airs on Showtime about a blood splatter analysist  in Miami, Florida named Dexter Morgan. Everything about Dexter's life seems perfect but he has one very dark secret, he's a serial killer. Most would think that this is a horror show but it's so much more than that. The show is a perfect blend of drama, suspense, comedy,and story telling.    Warning: Mild spoilers ahead.      Season 2 starts with Sargent Doakes constantly stalking Dexter day and night. This is a great dynamic and really added an extra depth to the show that most shows doesn't have. The rivalry between Dexter and Doakes was filled with drama and exciting moments. But that's not even the main plot of the show. The main arc is that the bodies of all the people Dexter has murdered has been found at the body of the ocean. Dexter is forced to investigate the crimes he committed and he's in a constant game of cat and mouse with FBI agent Frank Lundy. Thee's even more countless subplots and arcs that are seamlessly intertwined together to make an amazing story that is one of the greatest told on television.     SPOILERS END    Now on to the actual dvd set. The set is four disks in 2 slims packs in one slip case. It's nothing special but it's very nice, neat, and efficient. The quality looks great and there's quite a few features on the final disk. Overall I'd recommend anyone to buy this set and give it a shot.

B0042816YK|4.0|I agree with one of the reviewers who wrote that some more easily relate to this film than others.  The film puts into words and images one take on midlife.  I wonder if it mirrors/symbolizes Margaret Mahler's stages of development.  Italy for symbiosis as highlighted with the merging with spaghetti scene.  India with separation from other/outer focus to an inward one via learning to meditate and Bali with independence and a return to the world with her stepping back into romantic relationships at a more mutual level.<br /><br />The Grimm's tale Duration Of Life also comes to mind:  The first thirty years is filled with a zest for life (Italy), the next thirty with grief and inner work (India or in the Grimm's tale:  the donkey and dog years) and the last phase (Bali or \\"the monkey years\\") with play and a generative contribution to society (a house was built for a healer).<br /><br />If this movie can be viewed as a metaphorical story for the midlife passage, Robert Bly's words come to mind when he said that fairy tales give us empathy and support to look inward to search for our core beliefs.<br /><br />On another level, this movie reminded me of Holland's Opus which was said to be a comfort movie for those who didn't realize their dreams - this movie for those who didn't experiecne the level of self fulfillment they would have liked or felt designed to experience.<br /><br />The scenes with Richard, who \\"speaks in bumper stickers,\\" seem to serve as an image of a Boomer mentoring an Xer.  A colourful, fun and decent movie.

B0009X75RO|5.0|I have to give credit to director Rob Marshall - he and his crew did a fantastic job bringing my favorite musical to the big screen. I live in Chicago and cannot be impartial. Tough act when you've seen this show on Broadway multiple times and understand \\"Chicago\\" transmits best when live on stage. I loved Marshall's idea to have the musical numbers play out in Roxie's head and this is one of the many reasons that it works. The sets and costumes are wonderful too. Now I feel that the negative reviews are plain unfair. Casting was right on. The stars, Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Gere are actors and not professional Broadway thespians. And many Broadway thespians will never be Hollywood A-list movie stars. With exception of Zeta-Jones whom is a talented dancer/singer, both Zellweger and Gere had a lot of courage to sign up for this film. Neither had attempted a musical before. All three actors really outdid themselves and the hard work paid off. Watch Gere's footwork in the tap dance scene and also his opening number \\"All I Care About is Love.\\" Catherine's \\"All That Jazz\\" rivals Bebe Neuwirth. And Renee was the biggest surprise of all for me. I loved her renditions of \\"Funny Honey\\" and \\"Nowadays.\\"  Queen Latifah was hilarious as Mama Morton.   Taking all these facts into consideration, \\"Chicago\\" is outstanding film and hopefully brought this wonderful musical to many new fans across the world.

Pandora looks like a good bet, but first we have to get rid of those pesky natives who won't take the hint and quietly disappear so we can grab everything they've got, especially since they are sitting on a mother-lode of unobtanium (get it?)  Ungrateful aliens won't even thank us for teaching them English.  Time to show them Who Is Boss.  So our military, backed up by some scientists in its pay, has hit on the genius idea of creating avatars of the native population with the purpose of first, getting to know the home folks, and then working from the inside to destroy them.<br /><br />Big yawn, as far as the general premise goes; we've been there before in the 15th century when the Europeans landed on the Western Hemisphere and proceeded to decimate the native Americans, helping themselves to the natives' gold and silver in the process.  The stock characters are so stereotyped they are practically caricatures: the evil rapacious colonel, the smarmy corporation representative, the benevolent scientist, the hero who saves the day, etc. etc.  If it wasn't for the visuals, I would have fallen to sleep ten minutes into the film.  We know how it's going to end almost as soon as the movie begins.<br /><br />But this film packs a visual wallop unlike anything this reviewer has ever seen before.  I was like, WHOA, NELLIE!!!  The CGI and the incredible 3-D effects make for a visual joyride that will knock you out of your seat.  As overlong as this movie is, I couldn't stop watching it.  The breathtaking special effects are so beautiful that I wanted to hop the next flight to Pandora.<br /><br />I wish I could give this film five stars just for the mindblowing visual experience.  But thanks to that banal plot and the mind-numbing dialogue, I have to settle for four.<br /><br />Judy Lind
0517548232|5.0|From previous reviews, I was under the impression that the \\"one lesson\\" was essentially repeated throughout the book.     This sounded rather tedious.    I was pleasantly surprised that each chapter covers a different topic. The \\"one lesson\\" is broad enough that it covers pretty much any topic in economics, so the author is free to discuss a long list of subjects and applications.    Despite being written decades ago, this book is (unfortunately) very timely. The blowout government spending of the last few years shows clearly that our society has forgotten much, perhaps most, of how economics works.    The only drawback to the book is that its title implies it covers all of economics. I had expected a one-book summary of the entire science (micro to macro).    Instead, the book's primary focus is on how government actions affect the economy. Granted, our government today interferes in almost every sector of the economy, so this makes the book more broadly relevant than the author probably would have liked.    Still, the basics of micro economics are not really covered here. They should be sought elsewhere.

B002ZG98LO|3.0|This review is for;[[ASIN:B002ZG98LO Predators]]<br /><br />After two stints of Predators fighting Aliens & a forgettable sequel of a downtown, Los Angeles-hunting Predator, the new \\"Predators\\" goes back to the cinema-style roots of the original, Predator film with Arnold Schwarzenneger. No Sigourney Weaver era acid-blooded Aliens to fight, spaceships or futuristic cities. Just a small war between Predators and un-suspecting humans who are literally \\"dropped off\\" on a mysterious planet with a dense, jungle forest reminiscent of the first Predator film. The odd-collection of individuals appear to be dangerous, but skilled killers from different parts of earth who seemed destined to die anyways had they remained on earth. The odd band includes a Russian soldier (carrying the Jessie Ventura rotating, chain gun), a South American Cartel (played by Danny Trejo of \\"Machete\\"), an African warlord, a death-row inmate (armed only with a knife), an un-armed doctor, a quiet Japanese Yakuza (who makes good use of a samurai sword that he finds later in the film), a mercenary who prefers to work alone (played by Adrien Brody) and Isabelle who we learn is the lone, woman survivor of the Predator encounter in Guatemala during the first Predator film. The odd-band of individuals also encounter a lone survivor (Laurence Fishburne) who we find out survived several Predator hunting seasons on the planet when it seems most others have perished.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Predators, but I just didn't gain any new insights on the Predators as I hoped I would. The only new thing I learned is that there are two different kinds of Predators (\\"smaller & bigger ones\\" as Laurence Fishburne explained) that are feuding against each other.  The planet in the film is just a mysterious planet and we do not even know if it is the Predator, home world. The film is just an experience of \\"cat & mouse, hide & kill\\" action sequences between the Predators and humans in a jungle pretty much like the first film in which both humans and Predators get picked off one by one. Adrien Brody is a fine actor in other films, but he really seems like an odd choice for this film as a more popular action star such as Vin Diesel, Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson or a Jason Statham type of actor would have better fitted the bill. I recommend \\"Predators\\" as I enjoyed it mildly but I think the desired results could have been a little better.oth humans and Predators get picked off one by one.

After watching HBO's mini series The Pacific I decided it was time to finally purchase this book. Definitely one of if not the best book ever written about WWII. Sledge along with the rest of his fellow soldiers are true American heroes, this is their story and what they saw and experienced. Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire book.

B003X8597A|5.0|First off let me say that this cut Rienzi is not a desecration of Wagner, and I am a major Wagnerholic. If you have made it through the entire Rienzi (there is a CD available by the BBC) you know that it is a numbing work - chorus after chorus, ballets that never end: enough material for two operas.  Do you really want 5 hours of second rate Meyerbeer? This is not mature Wagner, and anything that helps Rienzi work in the theater is welcome. This DVD delivers.   Yes, the work is brought up into the 20th century and casts Rienzi as a fascist dictator. But it works. Due to the cuts this streamlined Rienzi makes more of an impact than the sprawling original.    The musicians are quite good. The singers are effective actors. The conducting keeps the work moving. Don't hold your breath for a complete Rienzi. This production makes a good case for the opera. All Wagnerians should check it out.
0810997827|1.0|I agree that these books are not a good read for children. I saw that my son was really into these books so I read some of it, and was surprised by what I read. They are teaching kids behaviors that are inappropriate and should not be condoned. Now i see why these books are so popular with the young kids, the character is rotten and teaches all the wrong things. So sad to see some parents think it's OK for their children to read these books, have they even read them?!?

0451196716|3.0|I like King's writing but not horror, which makes it hard to read him. I've read several of his books but not even close to his full body of work. However, after reading The Long Walk, I have some thoughts about him in general.<br /><br />Writing stamina. The guy's got the stamina of a long-distance runner, and I don't mean just marathoners, more like those people that run 100 miles all at once. He claimed to have written The Running Man in 72 hours. Freaking amazing. The ability to put 100,000 words into some coherent form doesn't qualify you as a good writer, but there must be some sort of prize for that. King operates like a story is running through his head and he's just transcribing it. Just wonderful.<br /><br />Characters. His characters is why I like him. They're often quirky, spontaneous and irreverent. The Long Walk demonstrates this with so many players in the plot, there's always someone to love and someone to hate (Green Mile, anyone?).<br /><br />Blank page. Some writers work off an outline, others just start writing and let the story unfold without preconception and always a blank page ahead of them. Personally, I can't function without an outline. Maybe the blank page approach is what keeps his work spontaneous, but at times it drones on. In The Long Walk, I certainly had the sense I'd been walking forever, but sometimes not in a good way. At times, the story waffles and I had the feeling the story still had gaps (I'm still not sure what it meant to be squaded).<br /><br />Scenes and endings. King is a master of scene-building. I can still recall scenes in his books that I read years ago. Sometimes they make me laugh, sometimes cringe. Sometimes both at the same time. However, I haven't always been enamored with his endings and I'm a ending person. I can deal with a mediocre ride that has a stunning ending more so than the opposite. It's like sex. The beginning and middle are fun, but it's all about the ending. In The Long Walk, I was left with one thought at the end: Seriously?<br /><br />Adverbs. I know this is one of his earlier writings so it's not a reflection of his current work, but it shows you how writers evolve. The Long Walk is fully polluted with adverbs. I'm sure he'd cringe if he read it today. Maybe laugh, too.Adverbs. I know this is one of his earlier writings so it's not a reflection of his current work, but it shows you how writers evolve.

0525951652|5.0|I love historical novels. This is one the best I've ever read. You don't find a lot of novels on WWI. I loved the stories and sweeping depth of historical data. A great read.
0312600844|4.0|When I first finished the book I felt like I just ate a big dinner and was sorry I did.  This is a huge Novel.  Maybe too big.  The author could have got several books out of this one.  But given a couple of days it was worth it.  The subject is just a mirror back to society.  And that is what a good novel should be.
0439023513|5.0|This was a great book. I hate to say this, especially after reading the negative reviews by some, but I cried at the end of this book. I felt Katniss was devasted in a tragic heroine type of way. It's the reality of war and manipulation that leaves such an impression at the end of this series. I've stood in the middle of Aushwitz in Osciem, Poland. It's the epitomy of human failure; that yes, was ended by a physical war, but began as a mental one. Anyways, I highly recommend this book and this series!
B004132HZS|5.0|I watched the series when it debuted and was left clamoring for more. It is beautifully written and directed, with witty dialogue that keeps it lively. If you like a quirky re-imagination and are open to tweaking a classic to create something new, then this is an excellent work.
0470449764|1.0|I just took the Gmat.  As in 30 minutes ago.  I already wrote a review on the verbal gmat review and now came over to review the quantitative.  The exam was much harder than this book.  There were questions on the GMAT that are far more complex and difficult than are contained in this review or the official GMAT review.  This book is ok for giving you the basic layout and ideas, but it just didn't come close to what I just went through.  I know it sounds like I'm griping because I did poorly on the quantitative section.  But take it as a warning.  I know I studied well and had other books to go along with this review guide.  I studied the principles and problems contained within this book, but when it came to the actual test, there were questions I simply didn't recognize.  The practice tests on MBA.com didn't do me much good either apparently.  Where I excelled at the verbal, I fell far short on my expectations on the quantitative.  On average of the practice scores compared to my actual score, I dropped 24 percentile points!!!  THAT'S 24 PERCENTILE POINTS!!!  This book and the practice tests aren't difficult enough.  They aren't in depth enough.  My +17 points on the verbal, netted me at a percentile ranking 10 percentile points below what the practice test told me.  Basically, 30 points lower than I averaged on the practice tests and 60 points lower than I wanted to score on the actual test.  Needless to say, I am more than disappointed by this book.      It will help to get you started.  But don't trust that this is the level to be expected.  You have to find harder problems!!

I highly recommend this edition to all whitney Fans and to all music lovers. Enjoy the \\" THE VOICE\\"
0470449748|4.0|I just took the exam, literally.  Finished about a half an hour ago.  I did better on the Verbal than I had anticipated based on how I did in this book.  The test was simply easier than the problems in this book.  So, it prepared me for the worst and it wasn't that bad.  I scored 17 percentile points higher on the actual test than I did on the practice tests.  Go figure... the quantitative on the other hand, that's another story.
0446195529|5.0|I haven't read the other Camel Club books but this stand-alone thriller interested me after reading the highly recommended [[ASIN:1600200486 Gods of Ruin: A Political Thriller]]. Hell's Corner is the park accross from the white house that is guarded by DC police, Secret Service, and park police and is the hub for tourists and protesters. I wasn't sure why it was called that until all hell broke loose when the protagonist, Oliver Stone (a dig on the director?) was caught in gunfire and an explosion when meeting his band of patriots at the park.<br /><br />When Stone awakes from getting knocked out, he's got a new mission: find out who was behind the attack at Hell's Corner. He teams up with a Brit and gets help from his Camel Club peeps as he investigates first a Mexican drug cartel, then the Russians. During the investigation, one government bureaucracy after another gets in the way.<br /><br />If you like \\"Gods\\", which has a better premise, you'll like [[ASIN:0446195529 Hell's Corner]]. It's got political commentary, action, and it's well-written (better than Baldacci's earlier works).
B000QUCNOK|5.0|So, are you into insane endings? Ok i'll admit this one has a moment or two that drag but, you name 5 movies in 2 minutes that dont have those moments that pull a yawn out- Excluding this one.    Go ahead....    This movie is dark, the story is very interesting, further more you get to learn how to talk the perfume talk, learn a bit of history making of perfume, And as if it couldnt get any sweeter, the ending throws such a curve ball it will have you telling your friends the same thing. The ending... That damn ending.     So If your into johny depp type movies, well told stories, and are looking for a dark passionate well made film, this is one you should get on date night no less.    Enjoy.  Joiecel

B0040QYROA|5.0|I watched the new version on TMC Nov 7.  It is great, yes the new stuff is in bad condition, but I like that it's easy to tell what is new and what is old.<br />I immediately went to Amazon to buy a copy.  Then I got to th1nking, my old Masters of Cinema DVD version was better than the old Kino, so I went to Amazon<br />UK and looked it up there.  I have a region free DVD player and this is exactly the reason why.  The Master of Cinema versions are awesome( there are 3 different packages).  It comes in a steel case with a 56 page book and best of all there is a version that has both the DVD and the Blu-ray together for about 35 bucks. I pre-ordered it and it should be here in a couple of weeks.
031603438X|4.0|Everything that is told in \\"Life\\" is so vivid and rich in details it seems that it came straight from a personal diary, (as if Keith is really the type of guy who is concerned about writing his daily adventures on a notebook).<br /><br />The book is divided into three major parts: first is about early life in east of London, adolescence and the development of taste for music until the foundation of The Rolling Stones, heavily influenced by Blues and Jazz; second (and the darkest) was about life on the road after their take-off to stardom, tense relationships with his band mates and Anita (first wife), drug abuse, personal struggles (including the loss of a son) and occasional problems with authorities, and third and last back to music and life in recent years, covering what seems to be the everlasting feud with Mick Jagger (professionally handled over the years), the influence of business and money in music and some other everyday things, like family life.<br /><br />In the audiobook version, after a duo narration by both Johnny Depp and Joe Hurley, Keith takes the microphone and ends telling the story of his own by himself, and in some parts he can't help but to entertain himself by laughing at his own tales.<br /><br />A good reading (or listening) for rock and roll fans out there.

B00447G2T8|5.0|I was looking on Amazon for new bands to listen to when I came across Helloween's new album \\"7 Sinners.\\"  Being that I have heard of Helloween vaguely I took a listen.  Once I did I was flabbergasted.  It seems I was severely missing out on a truly great band.  This band has a history almost as long as my life span.  Now with old bands they have a habit of getting stuck in their era.  This is the main reason why I stayed away so long.  NOT Helloween though.  They adapt with every changing time and produced fantastic albums.  I had to go back 20+ years worth of music to catch up.  That's a lot of listening and money spent.  Worth it by far.  So what about this album?  Complete and incredible music.  Contemporary to the last drop.  Taste the sweet melodies, screeching screams, wild drumming with crushing sounds that will rock your brain inside and out.  They have a song called \\"Are You Metal.\\"  Well...you better be because this album is pure metal.  No hard rock here at all.  Metal for the metal heads out there.  Andi Deris is an amazing and creative singer.  This guy has about 5 different voices.  He is definitely a complete singer.  There aren't many people out there like him.  I like him better than Michael Kiske.  The band shares in the writing so it appears they all have great creativity.  This album is better than all of their previous works in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong they have some gems in their catalog but this album moves them from just being a Power Metal/Rock band to being a Progressive Power Metal band.  The riffs and tempo changes and fast and flawless.  Solid performance.  A must have for metal heads.  Best tracks: \\"Are You Metal\\", \\"Who is Mr. Madman?\\",  \\"You Stupid Mankind\\", and \\"Far In the Future\\" which is an amazing closer song.  I am now a devoted fan.  If you like Helloween do not pass on this album.
1423101472|5.0|Joey's Review  THE LAST OLYMPIAN by Rick Riodan  This book was about Percy Jackson fighting in a war against Kronos that could save the world. My favorite character was Percy because he got offered by the gods to become a god but turned down. I liked this because it has action and adventure. You should read this book because you can imagine yourself fighting as a demon-god.  Five stars!
1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel in the sense that it brought back the Biafran War that has largely been forgotten by the rest of the world. In 1967, multi-ethnic Nigeria was split from the seams, during the three-year Biafran War that saw Muslim dominated forces from Northern Nigeria laying siege to the Christian Igbo of the south-east, who sought to secede from Nigeria after the widespread massacre of their people in the North.<br /><br />The story illustrated the horrors of the war that was unleashed onto the Igbo people. It was very painful for me personally, to read the story, because my very own family suffered greatly during the Biafran War. However, Adichie's straightforward style of writing was up to the task to tell the stories of the different characters who lived during this time period. I was very pleased with this author's work in this novel. Especially, knowing that she was born years after the conflict. The way the author wrote this novel, you would have thought she was living during this time period.
0439023513|5.0|I absolutely loved this story.  It was the perfect ending to a great series. I loved the characters, plot the twist at the end. You will definitely enjoy this series.  I read all three books in three days.  Wonderful!

I mean it's one of their best songs. How could it be discarded? All these best of collections are really a waiste of money. You get milked in for the four bonus songs. I mean if this set included never say goodbye I would have gotten suckered into buying this release also.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|These words really don't acurately described this album.  Yes it is \\"Trailer\\" music but that doesn't mean it isn't good.  And most tracks are around 2 minutes which doesn't mean it won't leave a lasting impression.  First time I listened to it, volume up, I literally got chills down my spine especially when the choir comes booming in.  And the songs have been in my head for some time here as well.  If you are a fan of orchestral arrangements/soundtracks then you will absolutely love these pieces.
0060934719|3.0|I didn't really feel too much attachment to the characters until much later in the book. It seemed to have taken its time in the beginning to build up an attachment to Dunstan Thorn and the slave lady, and then after that it just seemed to jump around and not really leave me yearning to read more and more. It was a cute story but also a sad story. I enjoyed it, I was just wishing to enjoy it much more. I am a little disappointed. I was not expecting to read a sex scene at all in this either (right in the beginning).
1439152780|5.0|If I only read one book this fall, I decided months ago, it would have to be The Distant Hours by Kate Morton. Kate Morton's debut novel, The House of Riverton, held me so spellbound that as soon as I finished it, I read it again. Despite the fact that The House of Riverton left me emotionally drained, I eagerly pre-ordered her next novel, The Forgotten Garden, and devoured it in one sitting, heedless of the late hour and lack of sleep, when it finally came. I'm glad to report that her third effort, The Distant Hours, was just as compulsively readable and captivating as the first two.     Everything I loved in The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden, and have come to expect from Kate Morton, is in The Distant Hours.    First, there's always a mystery that unfolds in lush, gothic detail, usually in a bygone era. Here, a letter sent during World War II arrives 50 years later. Like a siren call from the past, Edie is compelled to find Milderhurst Castle and discover the fate of the Sisters Blythe, Juniper, Persephone, and Seraphina. Aristocratic beauties in their day, what has happened to the Sisters Blythe over the years and what precipitated their tragic decay reminds me a bit of Grey Gardens mixed with We Have Always Lived at the Castle. So lovely and promising in their youth, they are now old women who never escaped the mouldy castle of their forebears, their dreams strangled by a mysterious tragedy 50 years before.     \\"Have you ever wondered what the stretch of time smells like? I can't say I had, not before I set foot inside Milderhurst Castle, but I certainly know now. Mould and ammonia, a pinch of lavender and a fair whack of dust, the mass disintergration of very old sheets of paper. And there's something else too, something underlying it all, something verging on rotten or stewed but not. It took me a while to work out what that smell was, but I think I know now. It's the past. Thoughts and dreams, hopes and hurts, all brewed together, shifting in thestagnant air, unable to dissipate completely.\\"    The long shadows cast by their controlling father, a celebrated novelist, and his most famous work, The True History of the Mud Man, over their lives has something to do with why the Sisters Blythe have never left the castle. Morton, as usual, is adept at weaving subtle strands and hints so that even as the reader uncovers more and more of the mystery, the final reveal is devastating and unexpected. Hint - within the short, haunting excerpt from the Mud Man tale in the beginning of the book are symbolic clues as to the dark history and future of the Sisters Blythe.     Love affairs cut tragically short; age-old secrets waiting to be discovered; suspenseful, atmospheric setting; and writing that left me breathless - The Distant Hours enthralled me to the very end.
031606792X|4.0|I loved this one. I thought I wouldn't because a lot of people I know seemed to not enjoy it. This was my second favourite out of the series (New Moon is my favourite). I felt I could relate a lot more to Bella in this one since I married my high school sweetie and had his children. The whole concept of the specialness of everyone and the descriptiveness in this story really was good. I liked the ending as well. I am glad I decided to read this series after originally not being at all interested in it

This was like Twilight and Dune combined.
0525951652|5.0|Like many, I was eagerly anticipating this novel after being swept away by PILLARS OF THE EARTH and WORLD WITHOUT END.  I was not disappointed.  Follett is simply a master storyteller who lures the reader in from the first sentence and never lets go.  Even today, a full week after finishing this novel, I am still pondering the fates of Maud, Walter, Ethel, Fitz, Bernie, Gus, Billy,  and all the well-crafted characters who people this saga.<br /><br />It is a love story told against the backdrop of World War I, a dramatic look at England, Wales, Russia, America, and Germany told from the perspective of the people who lived it.  Five families representing five powerful countries live through the lead-up to World War I, its devastating destruction, and bitter aftermath.  Their stories, be they aristocrat or spy, housemaid or lord of the manor, never failed to mesmerize this reader.  I found myself deeply engrossed in the Russian Revolution, the rise of the Bolsheviks, the horrendous conditions of Welsh mines and British factories, spy missions, and diplomatic treaties.  Follett sent me scurrying to the internet to flush out more details about Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill, Leon Trotsky, and the other real-life people who wove through this novel amidst the fictional characters.<br /><br />The research was amazing, the story-telling was historical fiction at its finest, and the drama unsurpassed.  Will Ethel rise above her station?  Will Maud find Walter after the War?  Will Lev ever keep his promise to bring his brother to America?  Will Billy survive the mines only to be a defendant in a military court-martial?  Prepare to be totally captivated as nearly 1,000 pages melt away and leave you eagerly anticipating Book 2 in this promised trilogy.

1439148953|4.0|Colm Toibin's Brooklyn is one of the most perfectly structured novels I have read.  This is often said about F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby.  Unlike Gatsby, Brooklyn is told in a simple and direct style from the point of view of an introspective somewhat shy Irish woman, Eilis.  Her observations are accurate, pragmatic, and tolerant with minimal interpretation as she enters the workforce in Ireland, limited in opportunities for women. Her older sister Rose recognizes Eilis' talent and is instrumental in getting her a work and living placement in Brooklyn with the help of a new era Catholic priest.  Though there are many restrictions in America on women, Eilis is able to make more advancements than she could have in Ireland given her grit, patience, and business talent.<br /><br />There are universal life traps in America as in Ireland that restrict freedom and opportunity for women.  Abandoning one set of expectations for another, Eilis comes to the realization of her inevitable lost independence in both countries.  Freedom and determination are undermined by love and regret regardless of setting. Ultimately, irrevocable decisions must be made.<br /><br />The perfect structure and simple and direct style is consistent and seamless from start to finish.  I did not want the story to end.
B0041CGP02|4.0|Some claim Jon Bon Jovi is single-handedly responsible for the hole in the ozone layer, citing all that unfortunate 80s hairspray. More importantly, others have tirelessly repeated that Bon Jovi is consummately overrated and that their winning streak is sure to hit a wall.<br /><br />Their fame, however, has long outlasted that classic 15 minutes. They are still around, and the reasons for that cover this record from top to bottom. Like it or not, the songs in this \\"Greatest Hits\\" package - especially the first disc - have been and will continue to be unavoidable. In the supermarket, on terrestrial radio, at frat parties and weddings, hits like \\"Living on a Prayer,\\" \\"It's My Life,\\" \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" and \\"We Weren't Born to Follow\\" will continue to superimpose themselves upon our lives.<br /><br />They have catchy choruses and memorable melodies that continue to endure, and \\"Greatest Hits\\" fuses them into one convenient package, released - in no coincidence of circumstance - right in time for the holidays.<br /><br />The single disc edition is ideal for the casual fan and has all the hallmark hits those listeners would be interested in, including the recent and excellent \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home,\\" although the second disc has some fine deep cuts - the highly listenable 1995 single \\"This Ain't a Love Song,\\" for instance. Other smaller hits that are missing - 2003's \\"Everyday,\\" for instance - should not bother the average fan.<br /><br />The new songs provide further incentive to take a look at \\"Greatest Hits,\\" although \\"What Do You Got,\\" chosen as the single from this release, is the least interesting of them with its paint-by-numbers choruses and bridges. It is not worth too many repeat spins, especially compared with the hits.<br /><br />\\"No Apologies\\" recycles the same old Bon Jovi themes of take-no-prisoners independence and living life to the fullest, but it still rocks solidly.<br /><br />The other new tracks only accompany the 2-disc version, but they are far better than the aforementioned. \\"This Is Love This Is Life\\" is similar to \\"No Apologies\\" but has far better lyrics, more impassioned vocals and rocks even harder. It would make an awesome concert opener.<br /><br />\\"The More Things Change\\" aptly rounds out with its bittersweet, hard-won retrospection. It is a triumphant moment - a moment of looking back at the past and taking stock of the present, both its trappings and its treasures:<br /><br />\\"Yesterday keeps coming round - it's just reality/It's the same damn song with a different melody...\\"<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits\\" offers up a nice selection of hits and a few new offerings that forecast future endeavors for the band - truth in advertising, for certain.Love This Is Life\\" is similar to \\"No Apologies\\" but has far better lyrics, more impassioned vocals and rocks even harder.

I would still recommend it. The book is well written with sufficient imagery showing good and bad technique.  The only reason I rate it 4 is because of the misalignment of expectations.

B000KC4LNU|5.0|BOOKENDS (released in 1968) is the greatest of all Simon & Garfunkel albums, and one of the best records made in the 1960s.<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review on Christmas night 2006, I'd been nostalgically pondering a Christmas 42 years distant-- I was 14 then. 1968 was an awful year to live through for anyone, especially a kid. The Vietnam War, the assassinations of public figures, and seeing part of my city burn the previous summer during riots-- it was a lot to handle.<br /><br />The song \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" from BOOKENDS was in my head all throughout 1968. I identified with that frightened boy standing on the ledge, while a crowd below urged him to jump. His final thought as \\"he flew away\\" was \\"...I got no hiding place.\\" That was exactly how I felt in those days.<br /><br />What a powerful and unforgettable way to begin an album. The moods of BOOKENDS reflect so well the troubled times of the late '60s, with its anti-war sentiments (Punky's Dilemma), and its tales of love and love lost (America, Overs). The first side of the record ends with the sad longing and fears of Old Friends, who sit on a park bench and reminisce together. But this bittersweet song has a deeper message. These old men were survivors-- if they were supposed to be elderly in 1968, then they made it through the Depression, and two world wars, and if they were the youth of 1968 projected into the future, well they too made it through trials by fire.<br /><br />And so have I made it through! I'm in my 50s now and headed for that park bench one day. The fears and sadness of 1968 are long past, but a final memory remains:<br /><br />As I lay in bed early that Christmas Eve, the colored glow of tree lights seeped into my room. Off in the distance were disembodied television voices of Apollo astronauts circling the moon-- they read passages from the book of Genesis, and wished well the \\"people of the good Earth.\\" It was a peaceful and hopeful ending to a terrible year.<br /><br />Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time.

0439023521|5.0|[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games: Book 1]]<br />I LOVED it. Interesting concept that leaves you wanting more, romance that isn't just about the good or the bad but about something more substantial and a whole lot of heart stopping, perfectly gasp worthy moments where you sit reading rapidly just trying to keep yourself from screaming out to the characters or crying silent tears. It was wonderful. I can see why so many people enjoy it! It has the adventure side of it but the main characters are still very sensible and level head. It has the mystery that leaves you hanging and wanting more. Most importantly, it has an amazing plot written out in an elegant writing style that is straight and to the point, something I find very refreshing. I would definitely suggest it to anyone, especially fans of dystopias!<br /><br />For the full review and more:<br />[...]<br /><br />The order of the series:<br />[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games: Book 1]]<br />[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]<br />[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]

0312360258|4.0|Okay, I will admit it. The first time I saw this book I picked it up, saw that the first page said K-babble, turned to a random pages and started reading and saw something I felt was inappropriate and put it back down deciding not to buy it. I won't lie about it but then the other day I was at the library and figured, well, I am not paying for it. Now... my full confession. This series has become my guilty pleasure. I realize there are points that a lot of parents would not be okay with and I will start out with those simply because I know a lot of mothers read my reviews while looking for books for their daughters and I feel that you should be well informed before making a decision about this series. This is a vampire series, does have a near oral scene, has a small amount of cussing and a few other parts of the books that mothers may or may not approve of. Now for the good part. I normally really dislike books with that kind of content... not this one. It is written in a perspective that makes the teen aspect of it more realistic, the main character is intelligent, level headed and easy to relate to and I even went as far as to go out and buy the first four books. (Betrayed, the second book is eagerly awaiting me in my purse.) I was reading and could really relate and feel what she was feeling make me perfectly sure that P.C. Cast and her daughter Kristen Cast make a perfect team. I JUST LOVED IT! Off to go read the second book and eagerly awaiting seeing what will happen next. I really should have picked the book up the first time and to be honest, when I get proven wrong about a book I thought I might not like, I like it. I love having a book pleasantly surprise me and boy was this one a surprise!

B003YHSE7W|5.0|I was concerned with the fact that one of the main characters from the first movie had been recast.  Then I heard Mr. C was the replacement.  Still had my doubts, not about Don's acting ability, (he's friggin amazing), but about ANYBODIES ability to pick up where some one else left off... D.C. did not disappoint and proved me wrong!

There are many books that have werewolves or involve wolves but this has to be my favorite. I enjoyed the switch in perspective, I think it added a lot to the story.

1594488843|4.0|This is, of course, a book about motivation - a basic but very important concept.  The author notes that when it comes to motivation, there's a gap between what science knows and what business does, but the current business system is built around carrot and stick motivators.  I found the whole topic of carrots and sticks to be very interesting, so instead of attempting to provide a review of the entire book, my review focuses on that particular concept.     In chapter 2, Pink explains why \\"carrots and sticks\\" often don't work and why contingent rewards (\\"IF you do this/THEN you'll get that\\") can have a negative effect.  I can vouch for this with my own personal experiences over many years.  I recently presented awards at a national conference to a group of managers from across the country.  We didn't announce that there would be any awards, so the recipients were all surprised.  There was no wrangling for an award or gaming the system - only genuine surprise and joy as the recipients were recognized by their peers for their performance.  Some of the awards were quite substantial, including some foreign travel with spouses included.  The awards clearly made people take notice and were greatly appreciated, especially since they were unexpected.      Pink notes that people use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often undermine that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity.   He gives the example of an industrial designer who loves his work.  If you try to get him to do better by making his pay contingent on a hit product, he'll almost certainly work like a maniac in the short term.  However, he'll very likely become less interested in his job in the long term.      If you're not sure you want to read or buy the book, I strongly suggest scanning the summary at the end of it.  It gives you an excellent recap of the salient points and is all you need to determine if you want to readthe entire book.
0743486285|5.0|I read this book WITH my teenage son.  Actually--he was reading it, which made me nervous so I downloaded it onto my Kindle to see what kind of \\"damage control\\" I was going to have to implement. As it turns out, I got hooked on the book myself (being a long time Crue fan who saw the Girls Girls Girls tour in Wichita Kansas...)and ended up having some of the best conversations with my boy as a result.  Thank you Sixx for NOT glamorizing the drugged out rock n roll lifestyle.  This book will do more to keep my boy OFF drugs than any lecture I could give.<br /><br />For those of you who may think I'm a bad mom to allow my son to read a book with bad language, sex etc. all I have to say is \\"welcome to the real world.\\"  Kids are hit by this stuff everywhere.  I'm glad this book was REAL and showed the ugly side of all of that.  My younger son is only 12 so I'm not ready to let him read it--but when he gets a little older I plan to read it again with him.  Like I said--this will keep more kids off drugs than any preaching we responsible adults can do and for that I'm grateful.<br /><br />Thanks Sixx.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I have watched this series and it is terrible. From the begining you are told nothing so you do not know really much about what is going on except which they are on. My dad is a former Marine and also cant watch this movie. Another example of this being so bad is the Marines look like slobs and not Marines! Compared to band of brothers there is no comparison. Lastly the core is not made up of one or two Marines but of many Marines. I would not recommend this to anybody!
0399536108|5.0|Whom It's For?  This is an awesome catalyst for anyone who either isn't satisfied with his life right now or is satisfied, but wants more.  Chris challenges you to examine your life.  Are you actively living your life?  Are you creating something remarkable?  Are you pursuing goals based on your passions?  Are you creating and leaving a legacy while enriching the lives of others?  Or are you just floating through life, not \\"doing too bad\\" just like most other people?  Chris urges us to take responsibility for our own lives, set big goals, conquer our fears, and cultivate awesome ideas.  If these ideas sound even remotely exciting to you, then read this book.  If you're fine just subscribing to a life of the culturally accepted norm, then don't bother.  Chris isn't a zealot.  He even says that he's rather preach to the choir than evangelize the unconverted.  Again, if you think there may be something better out there for you, then dive in to this book right away.  It will certainly inspire you.    What It's All About?  The theme of Chris' life, blog, business, and book is a coherent and sensible one - you don't have to live a conventional life like everyone else; instead, you can (and should!) challenge the norm and live a remarkable life in pursuit of your dreams and passions.  Chris is a writer, a businessman, a family man, and a globetrotter who has been living an unconventional life for years now.  In his book, he outlines how exactly he has done this so successfully for so many years.  But he's careful not to tell you that his is the only way.  He's just opening our eyes to possibilities, albeit ridiculously rewarding possibilities.    Chris starts out the book by recommending we set the terms to our own unconventional lives.  We have to take a serious look at where we are and where we want to go.  We have to define huge goals for ourselves.  We have to live the life of our dreams, not someone else's.  He cautions that when we do this, we will be faced with opposition from friends and family who think it's dangerous to live an unconventional life.  Don't apologize for pursuing your dreams.  It's okay if people are uncomfortable with it.  You have to do what you want.  While many may think it's impractical, Chris believes that the safest, most secure thing you can do is take responsibility for yourself because, at the end of the day, no one cares about you and your future as much as you do.    The middle chapters are all informative and eye-opening.  The chapter titles include:  Smashing Through the Brick Wall of Fear, How to Fight Authority and Win, Competence is Your Security, and The Personal Finance Journey.  They are jam packed with good information, some of it biographical, some just great thinking, and some resourceful.  In the interest of your time, I won't get into the middle chapters as much because the chapters that really resonate with me are Chapters 9-11 & the Conclusion.    Chapter 9 is titled Radical Exclusion and the Quest for Abundance.  Radical exclusion means shutting out anything that distracts you from your key priorities.  In this day and age, we're all so busy and we all have so many things competing for our attention.  I think it's absolutely necessary that we eliminate the unnecessary to make room for the things, people, and ideas that matter.  It's just like building financial wealth.  You can increase your income, but if your expenses continue to grow, you'll never create wealth.  Similarly, if you want to get more out of life, you need to cut your life expenses.    What Makes It So Different?  It's not a get-rich-quick book at all.  It's a book about finding your passions and creating a tailored life based on those passions.  Chris attempts, with much success, to open our eyes to other options we have in life.  Sure, there are always options A, B, & C.  But what about D, E, & F?  Why not invent your own?  Chris has done it, he tells us how he's done it, and he offers ways that we can do it as well.    A central theme of this book that I love, and a central theme of Chris' writing on his blog, is the idea of helping others and enriching other peoples' lives.  It's not enough just to kick butt in life; we have to do so abundantly and in a socially conscientious manner.  This is really important to me and I hope to most other people.  Chris backs up this theme by donating a portion of the book's proceeds to one of his favorite charities, Charity Water.    Are You Still on the Fence?  Buy the book.  It's inexpensive, it's a quick read, and it's fun.  If you don't learn anything about what I've discussed in the review, at least you'll learn how to get an MBA-type education for only a few dollars or fly around the world in first class for free or how to create your very own blog in a matter of minutes.  What am I saying?  There's something in here for everyone.

B0015DROBO|1.0|I will start out by saying that this is the first book review I have written for Amazon. This story disturbed me to such an extent that I feel the need to warn other readers before purchasing. Although I don't usually buy into hype of bestseller lists and other reviews, I decided to purchase this book. Having lived in Europe for 9 years, I thought a European thriller would be right up my alley. Sadly I was wrong.<br /><br />It is my understanding that the manuscripts for these three Stieg Larsson books were found following his death. Perhaps out of sympathy they were published. In any event, it would be interesting to learn if they were previously rejected while the author was alive.<br /><br />After reading other reviews I had in my mind to continue to read, even if the opening was long and drawn out. With fortitude I pressed on to the end. My reaction at the end was, \\"what was that?\\"<br /><br />I am a big fan of literature, especially thrillers. One of the first things I noticed about this book was the product placement in the form of an iBook. One of the criteria I use to judge if a piece of literature is \\"for the ages\\" is if someone could pick this book up 50 or 100 years from now and understand it all. I don't think this would be the case for this book. There is just too much vernacular that this has the making of a dime store novel vs. an excellent piece of literature.<br /><br />The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, begins on his crusade against this evil capitalist Wernestroem, of whom we never really learn a whole lot, except he is some bad guy who made a ton of money and supposedly deals in weapons, drugs and everything else that will cause the demise of western civilization. Almost zero effort is made in explaining the true evils of this supposed enemy.<br /><br />Then there's Blomkvist himself. He has deserted his wife and daughter and continues to be part-time lovers with his closest business associate Erika Berger, who, by the way, is married and her husband is OK with Blomkvist sleeping with her. It also seems he has sexual relations with about every other woman he encounters throughout the story. The height of the book is when another bad guy (I won't mention who) appears and it is revealed that this person kidnaps and rapes innocent women, then murders them and throws them into the lake.<br /><br />I actually laughed out loud at the end, when Henrik Vanger (the person for whom he works in solving this decade-old murder mystery) says to Blomkvist, \\"you have morals.\\" Uh-huh...<br /><br />The story is full of undeveloped characters, from the woman who runs the diner in Hedeby to the former police investigator to the strange brother of Henrik. These characters are mentioned to some extent in the story, but to the reader they play no role in developing the story. They just add to the chaos and random plot lines that seem to be grasped out of thin air.<br /><br />The case against this evil Wernestroem is made by collecting evidence illegally (for private individuals, at least) by hacking his computer. We are led to believe that this so-called evil genius was dumb enough to conceal all his evidence by keeping it in one place on his own computer. Again, uh-huh...<br /><br />Then when the evil Wernestroem's accounts are drained (again, illegally) the money is divided amongst our heroes. Not given back to society. Not donated to charity. Nothing. They just kept it. I guess two wrongs do make a right.<br /><br />I would seriously recommend everyone not think about purchasing this work. The way the reviews of the next two books are going, it seems like more of the same for the trilogy. In any event, my next step is to figure out how to get this work off my Kindle.also seems he has sexual relations with about every other woman he encounters throughout the story.

B0002EXFNI|5.0|An amazing teen comedy, that is very deep and enjoyable. It isn't a gross out sex comedy, it's a \\"sweet\\" teen comedy. It is funny and something that can be watch many times throughout the years.
0525421580|5.0|I am a big John Green fan; I loved [[ASIN:B0043RT8JU Paper Towns]] and [[ASIN:B000RK3JOC An Abundance of Katherines]] and I have [[ASIN:014241221X Looking for Alaska]] sitting on my shelf waiting to be read.  So when I saw a new book by John Green I couldn't wait to read it.  This was a wonderful book with wonderful characters.<br /><br />The book switches between two different viewpoints; each viewpoint is from a different Will Grayson.  The first Will Grayson is best friends with a huge gay teen named Tiny.  Will kind of lives in Tiny's shadow.  Tiny is preparing a glorious musical for high school that he wants Will's help with; Will is struggling with his relationship with Tiny as well as with how he feels about a cute girl named Jane.  Tiny is trying to force Jane and Will into dating.  Then there is the Other Will Grayson, who we will call OWG, who is having an online relationship with a teenage guy; they finally decided to meet in person.  OWG is also dealing with his best friend who is a girl but wants to be more than that and with ongoing clinical depression.  Things culminate into craziness when Will Grayson enters a porn shop out of boredom and bumps into OWG, who is looking for his online boyfriend.  The reader is left on the edge of the seat wondering what will happen with Will Grayson; will him and Tiny stay friends, will he hook up with Jane, will the musical go on?  What will happen to OWG when he tries to hook up with his online crush?<br /><br />Okay I am not sure if the above clarifies things, but remember this is a John Green book...so despite (or maybe because of) all the weird relationship stuff going on this is a really great book.  You have a lot of wonderfully realistic characters dealing with a lot of issues.  Green and Levithan do an excellent job capturing the intricacies of all of the teenage angst that these characters are going through.  The characters are wonderfully quirky and easy to sympathize with and love.<br /><br />I have never read anything by Levithan before, and I am assuming he wrote what I am calling the OWG parts of the book (since that Will Grayson was introduced second).  He does a great job capturing the troubled moments of that character as well and after reading this book I really want to read more from Levithan.<br /><br />I was also really impressed with how the Will Graysons' parents were portrayed; the parents are understanding people who are trying to do the best that they can as their sons struggle through high school and adolescence.  I think most parents really do try to do the best that they can for their kids, (despite what a lot of YA literature portrays) so it was nice to see this...it leaves you feeling good.<br /><br />The character of Tiny bears mentioning because he is central to so much of the book.  Tiny is large and gay and proud of it; he portrays a sense of positivity that is prevalent throughout the whole book...and in a way it is really him that drives the story.  You have to love Tiny; his confidence in himself, the way he tries to exude happiness, his melodrama, and his utter belief in love.<br /><br />The writing of this book was high quality and super easy to read.  It was incredibly engaging and I found myself reading the whole book in a day, unable to put it down for longer than a few hours at a time.  There is something magical about the story and the way it is written; even if there isn't actually and fantasy here.<br /><br />I know this book has created some controversy as to whether or not it is age appropriate.  I agree that it is probably best suited for mid to older teens.  There is a ton of swearing, lots of talk about sex, and loads of gay sexual references.  All of this was fairly pertinent to the story, so I don't think it was frivolous.  At heart this is more a book about friendship, about love, and about accepting yourself and others for who they are.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful read.  It leaves the reader feeling positive and upbeat.The book addresses issues about self-confidence, belonging, GLBT rights, accepting people for who they are, love, and happiness.  This book just cements John Green more firmly in my mind as a must read author.  It adds David Levithan to my list of authors I want to read more from.  I have had Levithan's [[ASIN:0375832998 Boy Meets Boy]]on my \\"to read\\" list for a while now and this book makes me bump that up further on the list.GLBT rights, accepting people for who they are, love, and happiness.

B0040YFR1Y|3.0|It was an interesting spin on the plot.  The ending and the change in character for one of the cast members was easily predictable.  It wasn't great, but it was entertaining and worthy of being added to my collection.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Classic 1998 release! The information about this record is based off of wikipedia.org.<br />-Record breaker by selling 420,000 in its first week.<br />- Garnered 5 nominations and won that many awards, a first by a female artist.<br />-8x platinum!<br />-#312 on Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time.<br />-Critical acclaim from Allmusic, Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and USA Today.<br />Folks, this album is quite eclectic with music genres too. Lauryn Hill wrote all except the last two hidden tracks. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill won album of the year. I enjoyed the Rap of \\"Lost Ones,\\" the slow jam hit \\"Ex-Factor,\\" the religious \\"To Zion,\\" the implication of the chorus to the hit \\"Doo Wop (That Thing),\\" the analysis of The Doors' based \\"Superstar,\\" \\"Final Hour,\\" the slow and serious \\"When It Hurts So Bad,\\" the duet with Mary J. Blige on \\"I Used to Love Him,\\" \\"Forgive Them Father,\\" the lovely duet with D'Angelo on \\"Nothing Even Matters,\\" the fast-paced hit, \\"Everything is Everything,\\" and the piano flavored title track. The remake of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" from Frankie Vallie was decent too. This album will be in your CD player or stereo for a while. I've said enough.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Good vs. Evil is the way to look at this movie. If you have a problem with the existence of \\"evil\\" you will most likely not enjoy this movie.      The story is filled with themes such as standing up for the weak, facing your fears and enemies- even if it's your own brother. At one point the brother of the main character joins the \\"Pure Ones\\" because they are strong. Why hobble yourself with the weak? He wanted to be the best, and staying with the weak doesn't work with that goal real well.     It's a story that shows that being good is more than being the best or strongest, though those traits may still also be necessary.     The main character of this film, a young male owl who has grown up hearing war stories of the past, eventually meets the author of those stories. He's old and scarred, and he finds the real stories aren't so glorious- they are \\"Hell\\". But then the old scarred owl says, that's the necessary point. To do good, you still stand up and do what's right, again and again, even if you end up looking like him in the end. Even the \\"weak\\" owls are given tasks in his camp, and their specific worth is pointed out.    The Owls shows your greatest challenges are usually yourselves. A harsh theme many adults rebel against in all their complexity, searching for reasons to justify bad behavior. Many adults prefer villains like Darth Vader who is wronged, is tricked, and then he goes bad because of it (outside evil or others made him do it). The owl's bad guys go bad all on their own, simply because they want to be better than the rest. The willingness to do \\"anything\\" to be the best and the strongest is their downfall. The outside influences are just the opportunity, nothing more.    This isn't the \\"if you kill the bad guy, you'll be just like him\\" philosophy that's so prevalent in most animated films and TV shows either. The Legend of the Guardians is in fact the exact opposite; To stop, and if necessary, kill the killer and end his reign, is the right thing todo. It's the land of the free, because of the brave themes. One of the hardest lessons of all is you might even have to stand up against someone you love.     It's a story that will appeal to kids (especially boys who crave good male role models), but the darkness of the fight scenes could scare very young children. 8 years and up is what I would give as a general rule.     The animation is an A+ --especially in 3D. The owls look extremely lifelike, and the story is original enough that it's an easy film to watch. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is basically bloodless. Real young kids probably won't catch exactly why a helmet goes flying off for instance...helping to give the stories mature message an easy way to get across.     I really enjoyed the movie, specifically because I found the themes to be so much more than in most movies- though this IS a KIDS movie. But even if you put all that aside, it's a good action flick too!
B000002B5L|5.0|This is a classic! 4 singles were released from The Score from the Fugees: \\"Fu-Gee-La,\\" \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" \\"Ready or Not,\\" and \\"No Woman, No Cry.\\" According to Wikipedia, with the album being released on February 13, 1996, it eventually went 6x Platinum and is #477 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. That professional, Allmusic, The Source, The New York Times, and Spin all gave it critical acclaim. Every song is worth the listen, even the remixes. It took me a while for this album to leave my CD player. Check out the lyrics to The Score too!
6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead II is the ultimate Evil Dead movie. It is the sequel to Evil Dead. Evil Dead was a scary horror film. In Evil Dead II the scares were intentionally lowered and the movie goes more for laughs.<br /><br />In the film, Ash, played by the great American actor Bruce Campbell, goes to a cabin in the hills with his girlfriend and unleashes demons by listening to a recording he finds in the house.<br /><br />This movie is really funny and contains the most memorable scenes from the Evil Dead series. It is a very happy horror film and after watching it I was in a really good mood. In the first movie, Ash was a insecure college student. In this movie he is like Rambo. Other funny characters in the movie besides Ash include a hillbilly hick character played by Dan Hicks and his girlfriend Bobbyjoe.<br /><br />The commentary has the makers of the film along with Bruce Campbell commenting on the film and making a lot of funny comments. The movie is both entertaining with the commentary and without it. The DVD also contains a documentary on the making of the special effects with camcorder footage taken during the making.<br /><br />Before I saw Evil Dead II I didn't know what I was missing. This movie definitely was a groundbreaking moment for comic horror films.
0395645662|5.0|I remember reading this book in school it was great then and its still great.  Im not much of a reader and i was suprised how into the book i got. its a short book and is so interesting im just flying right through it. Cant wait to get the other 2 books that come after it... I never knew it was a 3 book series.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I thought it was a fun and catching series.  Not a Emmy winner, but it will do.
0743486285|5.0|So I've read every Crue book that there is to read, and I find this one very difficult.  I've read The Dirt countless amount of times, and I never have a problem picking it back up again.  But The Heroin Diaries is not meant to be enjoyed.  Its a very chilling tale that you read once, and give the book to someone else so they can learn a lesson.  I found it interesting, but I'm scared to read it more than once, because I really don't want to water it down.  It freaked me out once, and I don't want to lose the message it tattooed in my brain.  So this is what I did...I took the book, read it, and passed it to the next person, and so on down the line...If you buy it, prepare for something that you will never experience again.  I love how it was written, and I love everything about it.  I will truly never forget it, or its message.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I went to see this film, only vaguely aware that it was about a Lesbian family. Mostly I was drawn by the two lead actresses, Benning and Moore, who have long been among my favorites. They did not let me down. Both break new ground with what one other reviewer has call \\"pitch perfect\\" performances in uncharacteristic roles. Benning's silent, stunned slow burn, as she realizes what has been transpiring between her partner and the Mark Ruffalo character, will surely go down as one of the great moments of cinematic acting.   While very entertaining in a first viewing, I have the feeling that this film will repay many more viewings. It comes on as a conventional genre family comedy/drama and proceeds to draw us deeper (not altogether willingly) with each successive scene. Although the ending can be construed as hopeful, it leaves many issues unresolved, more like a comma than a period. It left me with substantial characters who live and grow in my memory. These are flawed human beings who will continue to have to forgive and adjust to the changing configurations of their relationships. It's not 'just a movie\\", Alfred. Welcome to the world of grown up relationships in the real world, chronological adults as well as the kids.  This film is further evidence of a growing feeling I have had that as far as seriousness treatment of GLBT characters in contemporary setting goes, the ladies are way ahead of the guys. As evidence, I submit \\"Saving Face\\" and the much underrated \\"Imagine You and Me.\\" \\"Brokeback Montain\\"? Come on, Lee's \\"Wedding Banquet\\" has already aged way better.
B00013VHI0|3.0|This album is 3 stars because many of the songs are listenable. I rather enjoy listening to this album.<br />I just recommend this album. Addy.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Lousy headline I know, but there you go. ANyway onto the review.    As above review is from when I saw the movie as not got the DVD yet. First of all I am pushing 50 years old, dont read comics and dont and never have done video games, but I love music and how it can be used in movies. Although I did arcade games in the late 70s! Also read that Michael Cera was going to be in this so immediatle thought geek with super powers. Felt better when I knew Edgar Wright was directing. Being English loved \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\". Even though I knew about the 7 evil exces I thought I'd give it a miss. And I though it won't be anywhere as good as \\"kick Ass\\".    But the more I read in \\"Empire\\" British movie mag, the more it started to appeal. The one thing I had gooing for me was the music.     So I saw it on a matinee. Wow. From the moment the lights went down to the end of the credits. I loved the humour, the bonkers battles, the cool kids. Made me wish I was young again but in their world. It was so much fun. I am unemployed and this was a blast and made me feel so elated after I saw it. One of the films of the year for me. The mousic of course was brilliantly and used so well. I bought the CD as soon as it came and when I have more cash will be checking some of the bands on there out.    It's a late teens/early 20s audience film, but for those of their parents generation, I think this may just work from a notstalgia and youth memories from late 70s early 80s.     5 *****s, great fun. Give it a go.

B003UYUR10|3.0|As a movie based on a popular game, I would have to say that  taken strictly at face value, Prince of Persia - Sands of Time is not half-bad as a movie. It's not [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]] - but neither is it [[ASIN:B00003CXIV Battlefield Earth]]; just an agreeable middle of the road fantasy spectacular. This may be the key thing about movies based on games: gripping situation, fairly interesting characters, a very, very well-visualized world  . . .  and a paint-by-the-numbers plot. Not to say that Prince of Persia is badly or incompetently plotted, just that any plot which would have rung changes on the same set of characters within the world of ancient Persia created for it would have done just as well - and will probably serve equally well in a sequel. Or two, or three, since the whole thing with the glass-handled dagger brings the story around again to the beginning, with nothing changed, just like starting another round of the game. Otherwise, it's lovely eye-candy, on several levels. As a bonus, it offers some agreeably amusing supporting characters, most especially Alfred Molina who now owns the franchise on comic villainy. There is also a rather nice rapport between the hero and the feisty princess-priestess, Jake Gyllanhaal and Gemma Arterton, and supporting acting talent more than equal to the materiel - although seeing Ben Kingsley in what at first appeared to be a minor role was a dead giveaway in the first five minutes that his character was up to something villainous. Location shooting took place in Morocco - which apart from some of the desert vistas, appears to very good effect. Of the extras, the most outstanding is a fairly detailed `making of' featurette. This version came in a three-disc combination package: a DVD and Blu-ray version, plus a digital copy. This may be the most sensible and flexible way to retail feature movies for the near future.
B0041CGP02|2.0|Well here we are again...another lackluster hits collection for the holiday season.  All these songs are great songs but there are a few missing...In and Out Of Love???  Everyday???  Anything from 7800 or Bounce...NOPE!!!   WHY???  There are only 12 songs on the second disc!!!  Could have fit a few more!!!  Would have loved for them to have included \\"Let it Rock\\" or \\"Raise Your Hands\\"  C'mon guys...Oh wait...they must be waiting for a Hits Box Set...More money for us to spend!!!

0525951652|3.0|Ken Follett is one of my all time favorite authors. \\"Fall of the Giants\\" is a disappointment. He either gets bogged down in tedious history, or goes off on these schlocky romance novel forays that must be a delight the 85 year old biddies sipping tea in their parlors pinning for the good, bad old days. I keep waiting for it to get better. To get to the meat. I'm still waiting. Every one loses their mojo eventually. looks like it has finally happened to Follett.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Katniss Everdeen isnt some incredible fighting machine. Shes human, with thousands of layered personality aspects. In this book, we see them all. And the ending, which my sister has been complaining about, isnt incomplete. Its realistic, and to me perfect . I wont forget this book, or Katniss, for a very long time
0439023483|3.0|I have been enthralled by the first two books, but I must say I am somewhat disappointed as well. Throughout the stories, there prevails a complete hopelessness, that I thought would end somehow. Unfortuneately, there is not a sense of human sanctity anywhere. And mercy killing and betrayal are prominant. There is not even a hint of spirituality anywhere. I believe the author has suffered great loss in her own life, and must have a deep seated sense of loss, that is only a hopeless end. I will probably read the third book, but I am almost afraid to. These books certainly don't belong on school shelves.... it only promotes the culture of death that our society has embraced. Today's youth does not need this
B0009R1T7M|5.0|An amazing album by Sufjan.  I especially like the songs \\"Jacksonville\\" and Chicago.
B0000029LG|5.0|I'm not even going to bother with DISC 1. It comprises of previous material, which every MJ fan should have by now.  But it misses several classics, like Dirty Diana, Will You Be There, and Who Is It. So thus I give this DISC a 4/5.  But, DISC 2, it gives you the most personal songs to have ever come out of this man. Let's see.     1. Scream. A electrifying start to the album. The duet between brother and sister is great, speaking about injustice,  and anger really flows out of this piece. Gets you dancing too. The video, the most expensive music video ever made,  shot in black and white, is also great. VERY futuristic. 10/10    2. They Don't Care About Us. Simple words, yet such a strong message. I see no problems with some of the anti-semitic lyrics. The haters made too much of a deal. There are two music videos to go with this song. One shot in Brazil, and a music video that takes place in a prison. MJ wrote this all by himself. Amazing. 10/10    3. Stranger in Moscow. This was written when the stupid child molestation accusations in 1993 started to come out.  I think he said that this was written in a hotel in Moscow, with the fans outside showing him so much love and support. This was during the Dangerous Tour I believe. Such a painful song, and such a haunting melody. Really makes you cry at the pain that was inflicted both emotionally and physically to him for supposedly molesting a child. I hate the ignorant fools who don't understand MJ's message. LOVE! Anyways, this is a great piece. 10/10.    4. This Time Around. A nice piece. Great rap bridge from the Notorious B.I.G. 9/10    5. Earth Song. AMAZING. One of the best songs MJ has ever written. Certainly the best ballad MJ has written. So emotionally powerful. 10/10    6. D.S. The song probably directed at Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon, who ordered MJ to be strip searched (so cruel!). This has a cool beat to it, but the lyrics, well, they aren't top notch. But the guitar solo from Slashis really cool. 7/10    7. Money. I love this piece. He's not really singing much, more along the lines of talking, and as for the lyrics, they couldn't be more true. 9/10    8. Come Together. A cover of the Beatles song. It really gives you a break from the anger that MJ has shown with the previous 7 tracks. In my opinion, this version is better than the original! 9/10    9. You Are Not Alone. I'm sure a lot of people love this song, but I don't like it that much as the others who have reviewed this album. I can't explain it. But, it's probably just me. It does however, hold a Guinness World Record as the first song in the 37-year history of the Billboard Hot 100 to debut at number one. 8/10    10. Childhood. MJ called this the most autobiographical piece he's ever written. Despite a whole lot of people saying it's cheesy and sappy, I absolutely love it. 10/10    11. Tabloid Junkie. I love this. One of the best songs that shows MJ's anger with the media, along with Leave Me Alone. 10/10    12. 2 Bad. This is the lowest point of the album. I find that this should have been left out of the album, since the rap by Shaq, really isn't that nice. 7/10    13. HIStory. This piece gives you so much inspiration. The lyrics tell the listener to \\"create your history\\", which makes you want to change the world and create history. The lyrics also show the listener of the vast achievements of the great men and women who have come before us. The audio clips from various important times in our history are a nice touch, but sometimes I do feel they distract from the whole piece. But it's great nonetheless.  10/10    14. Little Susie. AMAZING. Just listen to it. It has such a haunting melody. Written by MJ all by himself. 10/10    15. Smile. I find that this piece, which is his version of the original Charlie Chaplin song (music by Charlie Chaplin, the words added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons long years after), to be a great way to end the album, because I feel that despite all the darkness, the anger, the paranoia, that was the subject of most of the previous songs, light is shining once again. The part at the end where MJ plays the piano and whistles, is great. I love that part, since it shows a happy, playful side to this man. 10/10.     This gives a total score of 140/150, which is 93%, which means this is a GREAT album.    * * *     In conclusion, this is a must-have for any MJ fan since this gives a personal insight into this man. Amazing.

1400052173|5.0|There's not much I can say about this amazing book that others haven't said. I will say that I am so glad Rebecca Skloot perservered through many obstacles and many years to bring this story to the public. I am not sure I would have had the patience, or that many others would have. The incredible backstories behind how Skloot investigated Henrietta's background just add so much to this story. This story made me laugh, brought me to tears, made me angry and helped me see things from a different perspective. Everything a great book should do.    We can't undo what has been done - doctors taking things from people, using them for research, and never explaining or compensating the patient for it. But we can recognize that we need to change things going forward. I also hope that many of the scientists and researchers who defend things like what was done to Henrietta Lacks and her family can read this book and understand that a simple thing, something they would have done and may do in their profession, can have lasting negative effects on people. I hope this book will not just tell people who Henrietta was but lead to a dialogue that enables medical research to continue, while allowing people to have control over their own cells and biological products.     I really can't say enough about this book. It is recommended reading for all people. Even if you don't \\"like science\\" or \\"like biographies\\" or even \\"like nonfiction,\\" read it anyway. There is a passionate story and an important message everyone should see. Congratulations, Ms. Skloot.
1587613379|5.0|for the last two months I have read this book and still reading, and this book by far has open my heart and my mind to the posibility of being in love with more than one person and not becoming posessive or jelous over just one girl! but to move around and seek other partners while holding down the emotional bond that you have with your primary partner. this book somehow called out to me in a small bookstore down in DC at busboys and poets down on 14th and V st.    I always use to think that being single was a curse and that if I had sex with multiple women then I would be a sinner and burn in Hell, but after reading this book I realized that America has a way of putting monogomus as the only true way to a fulfilling relationship. but as a human race, we all have needs and dossie is teaching us that we need to embrace our sexual needs and wants more abundently without attachment or control, she explains that love is not pocessive but unconditional when it relates to triads or poly-relations.    Dossie touches on issues that are ahead of what America is ready to talk about but is happening now, Monogomy is a good thing but we are starting to see marraiges in America break down and die instantly because of unrealistic expectations.  I would Highly reccomend this Book if you want to break free from your posessiveness and over bearing relationships that need fixing and I can say this book has been like the Bible I never had no judgements, no labels but embracing what human intentions we have for sex.    Please buy the book and Free your MIND!
1848566190|5.0|This is a top notch book. I love the art insight and the reasoning behind certain aspects of his pieces. It's like he is giving all his secrets away. Even through his tutorial DVD (sold separately) he conveyed one that used practical things to get a job done rather than panicking. Improvisation seemed to be part of his work flow. Excellant book!
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|This movie is totally awesome. Think about donnie darko, fight club, inception, etc. It's something like that. Bluray video quality is superb. Audio is really good. Some scenes make you feel like you are actually inside a ship.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Amazing movie. Finally, I got my Blu Ray copy today.  One of the best entertaining movie ever.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is the same original Lonesome Dove.  The sound is great, and blu ray clarity.  We now have surround sound and at the very beginning of the movie Jake Spoon throws something and it \\"landed\\" in the sound of one speaker on the left. That was a surprise and I even turned my head and looked.  Nothing like being new to surround sound technology!  This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.
030745455X|3.0|Somewhat disappointed in this book.  Sluggish and repettative in the middle.  Actually skipping areas.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I bought this movie because the other one I had was on VHS. I skipped from that, to Dune on Blu-Ray.  It is the same movie as the original.  Dune is a movie that most people who do not know the story or didn't read the \\"trilogy,\\" which is actually 5 books, get lost in and do not like. So, my recommendation is that unless you know the story, this is not just a movie to buy and watch for the fun of it. It is great if you are a sci-fi fan and know the gist of the story.  We have watched this movie at least 20 times since it came out. It is probably our most-watched film, since this isn't something we do (re-watch movies).    I think THIS version is better than the one that came out more recently and I even think the technology isn't bad at all.   I recommend this blu ray version for clarity and depth.  I am definately a Dune \\"fan\\" however.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|The Blu Ray version of this movie is really a treat after all the super awful dvd versions.  My only complaint that is that it's the directors cut which has the horrible shattered window cut and shows him rescuing that girl from the nazi's ( ugg ).

The designer is very nice~ although I meant to send him a photo wearing them but because of the weird summer i didnt yet u__u It makes one of my favorite songs ever even more awesome~    I'm Not Your Toy has a cute/electronic sound that reminds me of a more energetic (but less romantic lyrically) song called Sere Yo by Zion.     Ok, Take care and thanks for reading my review :D
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Do you remember when you'd get a new album and you simply couldn't take it off the turn table? You'd listen to it over and over again until it seeped into your unconscious? Frankly, the last time I did that with a record was Paul Simon's Graceland. And then I purchased Buddy Guy's Living Proof last week. Living Proof is easily the greatest record this seminal electric blues artist has ever made. At seventy-four years of age, Buddy Guy's voice is like Rebel Yell Bourbon and his guitar styling is SRV on steroids. The songs too, and Buddy is a great song writer and interpreter, are among the best and most compelling he's ever written and performed. I don't know what happened in his life that inspired this build up and explosion of his creative genius, but this record is spectacular from beginning to end. Guy's friend, Eric Clapton, has a wonderful new album out, too, but these records are from different universes. Strangely, Guys Living Proof has the power and energy you'd expect from a newcomer with something to prove, not a cherished veteran of the Blues Wars. If you think there hasn't been a great blues album in at least a decade, your wait is over. If you love the blues of Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, this record is absolutely in a class with their best work. If you love Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Johnny Winters, Kenny Wayne Shephard, Sean Costello, all of those guys could learn a lot from this Guy's new record, and if they're alive I'm telling you they ARE listening to it. If there's any justice in this world, this record should sweep the Grammies.
B003UBTX7C|2.0|Review of the book follows this \\"review\\" of ebook prices. Well, regardless of what a previous reviewer said, I WILL comment on the Kindle price. It's really absurd. I love my Kindle but refuse to buy any more books that are actually more expensive than the print books. There are lots of eBooks on Amazon that are low price (many free) and I'll stick to those until the new releases are more reasonable. Kind of a rip off don't you think, charging more for an electronic book than one that has been printed and bound. My husband is vision impaired so the Kindle has been a major boon for him. But he also says \\"No more overpriced eBooks. I'll stick with older releases and nearly free classics\\".<br />As for Baldacci, I downloaded a sample of Hell's Corner. I'm really tired of that silly Camel Club and find these books are becoming rather trite and overdone. Maybe Baldacci is getting lazy and complacent?
0307591549|5.0|I come from the skeptical & cynical generation.  People who smile too much scare me, like they got a disease and didn't tell me about it.  I think of myself as a \\"realist\\" but all the advertising has made me cynical.<br /><br />With that said, I happened to see this featured on Audible.com, and it peaked my interest.  I have been listening to it for the last week and all I can say is wow.  The book goes over the newest science in the Psychology and Neurology fields for compelling arguments of why certain action will benefit your life and the lives of others around you.  It answers they \\"Why\\" with results from Scientific Studies and research then tells you how.  Really easy steps that you can easily take.<br /><br />I was presently surprised by this book!  Get it, you won't regret it.
B000001GXJ|5.0|Simon Boccanegra (together with I Vespri Siciliani) is in many ways the late Verdi opera that got lost, having failed to achieve the success of his other late operas. Yet, the Council Scene might just about be the highlight of operatic history altogether (Verdi's first version of Boccanegra is also available, but does not have the Council Scene, which alone makes it a non-starter for me); you will be looking in vain, I think, for a more powerful, charged and intense scene than this. And I do not think that this scene (nor the rest of the opera) has ever been as powerfully rendered as it is here. The drama is so vivid, the pacing so marvelous and the colors so splendid that I can hardly imagine a better performance either. In addition, Abbado has a dreamcast on his hand and orchestral players (and a chorus) able to realize the minutest detail without compromising the unrelenting forward momentum of the work.     Cappuccilli's Boccanegra is noble and authoritative, with a vibrant, but still sensitively delicate and warm tone and wonderfully long-breathed phrasing; he is excellently partnered by the Fiesco of Nicolai Ghiaurov, who is poignant, alive and nuanced but with a biting edge as well as a rich tone. José Carreras' Adorno must surely rank among his most powerful roles, the singing is precise and lyrical and effortless, and van Dam's vigorous and spirited Paolo is equally impressive. Yet it is possibly Mirella Freni who in the end is closest to stealing the show (if that were possible given the sheer overall magnificence of the cast); assured and sensitive and with a radiance and sparkle that never fails to captivate - her top register is simply breathtaking.    The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and the sound is quite good - a little close, perhaps, but for some reason it just seems to add to the intensity of the drama. In short, if you do not already own this recording, you need to acquire it immediately; and if you already own it, get a second one. One of Abbado's best recordings, performed to perfection and an essential acquisition.
0439023513|4.0|While this book offered a good conclusion to the Trilogy, I found myself disliking the heroine Katniss more and more.  Her voice is increasingly despondent and she is incredibly indecisive about her role as the symbol of the rebellion.  One of her rivals summed it up best: \\"I also think you're a little hard to swallow.  With your tacky romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act.\\"  I found it hard to believe that a determined force of rebels would depend so much on an insecure 17 year old girl who can't even seem to make up her own mind.  Not to mention that she is constantly recovering from physical and emotional trauma that was inflicted because of her own disobedience.  Her motives were often very selfish.<br /><br />Aside from my frustrations with Katniss, the last 50 pages were engaging and really delivered a solid finale.  There is the obligatory lesson about human nature's flaws and weaknesses, but it isn't overly emphasized or too sentimental.  The main cause of conflict is the sacrifice of District children for competition in the Hunger Games to emphasize the Capitol's control.  I also appreciated that the luxury of the Capitol and the deprivation of the districts are shown in such stark contrast. This really emphasized the need for reform and justified the actions of the rebels. Regardless of this vindication, loyalties are challenged and allegiances are questioned, especially in characters like Haymich and Gale.  Katniss's growing uncertainty towards her allies generated a palpable tension that affected the final conflict. Despite the anguish of loss in the final pages, there was also a hopeful optimism.  Katniss's anger diminishes to resignation as she is forced to accept the outcome of her long-endured struggle.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the series, especially the first book, which I felt was original and engaging.  I found some aspects of books 2 and 3 tedious.  Katniss's attitude and indecisiveness bordered on frustrating, especially her hesitation to chose between Gale and Peeta.  Though the violence and carnage may not be appreciated by all readers, the premise was captivating enough to intrigue a wide range of readers.o chose between Gale and Peeta.

B003IKMR0U|3.0|Even though this is a quick, simple and fun game, I was expecting a little more for the $14.99 price tag (I purchased this from a Go! Toys & Games in the mall). The tubed container is only slightly better than what I get from a roll of toilet paper, being of a heavier weight cardboard and is wrapped with cheap labeling that can be easily torn or damaged in some way. Luckily the dice are of solid quality and I feel they will definitely hold up well after repeated use.    As for the playability, as I stated before, this game was quick to pick up and play. This made the game fun and playable while doing other activities. However, the simplicity and ease of game play is also it's weak point. After playing a few times, one can get bored very quickly. If this is the case for you, I would suggest altering the rules, which can easily be done to suit various goals, such as increasing or decreasing the brain/shotgun count.    In short, this is a good game, but a $4.99 price tag would make it more appealing.

B00005OM5L|3.0|I've been a fan of Clapton since the Bluesbreaker's album and I''m not a hater, but I removed this dvd from my netflix queu and purchased it after reading the reviews on Amazon.  (I needed another item to get my order of a recent book eligible for free shipping) I have all of the crossroads dvds, the cream reunion and the Eric Clapton and friends dvd (the best of the lot, maybe tied with the Cream reunion) and I have to state that I find his playing a bit lacking in this concert.  It's a great band, there's a lot of good music, but Eric's solos are spotty.  His attack is not nearly as strong as we're used to seeing and he frustrates me a bit with some drawn out repetitive phrases, especially at the begining of three of the solos.  It's not terrible and you won't get this set list anywhere else, but Eric's performance is not up to his normal creativity, fluidity and brashness.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|Long time roots listener and supporter. I have listened to all their albums, true hip-hop. The sound and artists are progressing. The music and lyrics of this release have both professional and authentic production. If you enjoy real rap/hip-hop, actual musicality, and songs more comtemplated than radio rap, then listen to The Roots' music. I take one issue issue with this release; the highest sound quality available is regular CD audio. A DVD-A or DTS 5.1 would have been nice.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I ordered a dvd for my daughters' 4th birthday, and when it did not arrive on time I contacted this seller and very graciously the seller sent another copy out right away.  I hope that the first copy was returned to the seller, I later found out there had been a mix with my mail.  Thanks for making my daughters' day!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great story, and great writing.  Too bad the digital edition is riddled with spelling errors and typos.  It is very distracting.
B004132HZS|5.0|I only saw the last episode on PBS but it was so good that I am buying the whole set.  I am a Sherlock Holmes fan from way back when I was a little girl and I'm much, much older now.  I've seen just about all the Sherlocks in all their reincarnations and so many were wonderful, great actors portraying him, but this version of Sherlock is the best.  The latest movie was fun, but this PBS series is so much better there is no comparison.  Of course, as I say, I only saw the last but it whet my appetite so I am buying all three episodes.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I almost didn't see this movie, because I don't like Michael Cera, whom I find 100% charisma-free.  My friends made me watch it, though, and I am so glad they did, because I think it's the most enjoyable comedy I've seen in years.  I'm pretty sure I laughed more during this movie than at any movie I've ever seen, and I'm not being hyperbolic.  The script for this film is truly clever, and the actors deliver the lines flawlessly.  The characters really are very likable, and -- whatever fun, goofy effects the film may use -- THAT is what engages the viewer.  I'll come clean here and confess to being right in the middle of this film's target demographic: I'm a gamer, a comics reader, and a big fan of Asian martial arts movies.  That last element is key, because that's where the plot structure comes from.  Scott Pilgrim combines the best of cinema and comic books and gives us something that's more fun than either.  This technique isn't entirely new; Natural Born Killers did something similar, but Scott Pilgrim vs. the World really hits the nail on the head in a way that that other movie does not.  Among its many great successes, this film really does a good job of evoking the college experience.  I could relate to the protagonist's not-entirely-ideal living situation, as well as the challenges he's facing in the dating arena, and it's that commonality that helps pull the viewer into the film and once the wacky video game/comic book/wuxia sequences start kicking in, this film is everything I could want from a fun, geeky comedy.  It's clever, brilliant, witty and fun, and there's enough going on that it bears repeated viewing.  While I still don't like Michael Cera, and I can't see a guy THAT lame having a chance with a chick THAT hot, that's the film's only weak point, and every other element of this film succeeds so wildly that I can easily overlook that one flaw and wholeheartedly give Scott Pilgrim vs. the World five stars.  Given how hard I laughed at this movie andhow much fun it was to watch I can't imagine giving it anything else.
B004A1Y4UM|5.0|The only real way to describe Volbeat is that they are a combination of Master of Puppets era Metallica, Social Distortion, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley...sort of. They're great and they continually put out great music. If you're a rock fan, a metal fan, or both-Volbeat is your band. I think Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil is still their best work, but Beyond Hell/Above Heaven is still a great friggin album!
B000002KAT|5.0|4.75 stars. Wow, what an expressive voice! It's hard to tell if he sings in joy or sadness. This could have remained the only Van Morrison album and I'd be more than happy. I can't think of many albums more pure than this. My interest in Van Morrison does not extend past this work of beauty. In some ways it outshines the best of the comparable Tim Buckley and that's a bold statement. The title track (maybe the whole album!) must and will be played at my funeral. It's that good. This album sounds as if Morrison knew he would die the next day and he was fine with it. I'd take any song on this album over \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" and the like any day. It's hard to believe Van was raised in Ireland based on the pure Americana of this recording. I love that I truly discovered the amazing gift of this recording in my late 30's. It means more to me after listening to many great, diverse artists over the years to hear \\"Astral Weeks\\" from start to finish recently. This album would be perfect if it were a little more stripped down at times. This work is very, very inspired, soulful and flawlessly unrehearsed. It's ghostly in the sense that Morrison seems to be inhabited by the spirit of someone that once lived in rural America soaking up the music.  I also love that, like Bob Marley, Van transcends anything on recording that could be labeled as \\"Hippie S**T\\".     If this is your style of music, check out the last 2 albums by Talk Talk and Tim Buckley's \\"Blue Afternoon\\" and \\"Happy Sad\\". Most works by the mentioned are a little more on the Avant-Garde side but, still very emotional and in a jazz vein.
B004B8RWWG|5.0|Alright, Second episode in.  So I have to say very good.  Very very good.  I am not a fan of the horror genre.  I hate zombies and I have never read the graffic novel.  but this is entertains In these two episodes I have not once thought that would not happened or this is just dumb.  I can honestly say for these two episode, my attention has been captured.  I am all in for the rest of the season.  The human survival story is taking center stage and that is great.  I would definite recommend this for anyone that can stomach a little gore, but not overly excessive. And, if they are looking for a solid entertaining our.

0765326353|1.0|First of all, I liked Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy and thought I'd give his new series a try.  I'm not a hard-core fantasy reader, but I've enjoyed George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, and obviously the LOTR series.      I really struggled with this book.  The characters are not likable and the dialogue is labored.  As another reviewer mentioned, some of his work seems derivative (even from his own stuff - like the prologue reading like something out of Mistborn).  There are multiple editing mistakes which really jar the reader - everything from spelling mistakes to missing prepositions. My biggest problem with this book however, is Sanderson's weird, seemingly half-finished world that he's created.  On one hand, he describes fantastical creatures like grass that pulls back into its hole when humans are around, or flying eel things that prey on dock rats.  On the other hand, his world still contains many normal animals like horses (or the above mentioned rats).  I noticed modern colloquialisms creeping into some of the character's dialogue as well which further distracts from this fantasy world.  My feeling is either go big and describe a complete fantasy world, or ground it more in medieval semi-realism, but it feels like Sanderson has picked somewhere in the middle and it doesn't quite work.    And one more note to Mr. Sanderson: Enough with the \\"spren\\"! We get it - every type of emotion or feeling or natural resource, or abstract concept has a physical creature associated with it in your world.  But by the 100th different type of spren described (I think it was \\"gloryspren\\"), I was ready to throw the book across the room.

1439133948|4.0|I've been reading Lois McMaster Bujold practically since she began, when a trusted friend shoved a copy of The Warrior's Apprentice in my hands.  I spent a good chunk of the 1990s eagerly awaiting the next installment, and in the months leading up to publication of A Civil Campaign, practically haunted the Baen website on an hourly basis hoping that just one more sample chapter had been posted when I wasn't looking.  Any new tale in the Vorkosigan universe is a big deal to me, especially since its now been eight years since the last.    So what's the verdict?    I wouldn't say Cryoburn was \\"worth the wait\\" of the last eight years, but it is a fun read.  Its rather light and strangely devoid of action, certainly the least intricately-plotted of the Vorkosigan novels to date.  But it is also full of the kind of wonderful character moments and societal extrapolation that Bujold loves, and for her fans I suppose that more than makes up for it.  It probably will not satisfy those who are not already fans of this series, and I don't think its the kind of book to hand to someone unfamiliar with the characters and universe, but for those of us who are fans of Bujold it will at least be a welcome new addition.    The story basically has Miles investigating what appears to be a slightly fishy business deal by a cryogenics corporation on the planet Kibou-daini, and then stumbling over a much larger conspiracy involving possibly defective cryogrenic procedures, kidnapping, murder, and even a slight side of political intrigue.  Miles handles it all with his usual aplomb, and the joy of the story is in simply watching him not only unravel the mystery but the steps he takes in order to get there.  Still, there is a theme to this book, namely the idea and concept of natural death as a necessary function of society -- a concept which is brought unexpectedly home at the books very end, in a poignant scene that will bring any long time reader of this series to pause and maybe even shed a tear.    I sincerely hope that Bujold plans on following up Cryoburn in the near future.  This book has certainly wet the appetite of her fans who have been waiting for years, and while I don't think its a perfect new addition to the series, I do think it succeeds in reminding us how much we love these characters and are always wishing for more.  Miles new status-quo at novel's end begs to be explored, and it would be a shame if we had to wait another eight years before Bujold decides to follow up on it.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|One the whole, one of the best war epics ever presented and follows the superb books it was based on and it is a tribute to the great young Marines who gave so much for their country. The battle scenes were very good with spot-on locales and scenery for Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Best of all, the actors looked a lot like the Marines they depicted and they were young as they should be. The acting was very good and the direction was spare and vivid - something you almost never see in any war movie. The only gripes I had were that since it is an HBO miniseries there had to be the usual incongruous sex scenes and periods of irrelevant blather and movie sound people that can never capture the real sounds of a firefight or near misses or high explosives: it always sounds like blanks being fired and the usual blackpowder simulators. Ah well - it's probably just as well it isn't too accurate or we'd have the audiences going through their own combat survivor issues afterward! Interestingly, almost nobody threw any grenades - even though they were extensively used, particularly in night combat.<br />The best part of the series is the ending, where they show the surviving veterans returning and the difficulty they had returning to their ordinary lives again after the hell they'd been through. No movie I have ever seen does a better job of showing the terrible damage done to the human soul after unrelenting and brutal combat.<br />I recommend this series - it's the best so far.
006145205X|5.0|Send your inner pessimist packing - along with organic crops and ethanol. That's the contrarian message of Matt Ridley's insightful, entertaining look at humankind's steady progress over the millennia. Ridley dips into biology and economics to support his case that life is good and getting better. His wide-ranging look at humanity's past and future makes it clear that those who long for the good old days just don't realize how rugged hunting and gathering or medieval medical care must have been. Ridley meanders at times, yet, as the title suggests, his book offers a fundamentally optimistic analysis of humankind's ability to solve the planet's problems, even now. getAbstract recommends it to readers seeking a thought-provoking analysis of contemporary issues that doesn't hew to conventional wisdom.

B000UJCALI|4.0|One of the creepiest horror films, Stanley Kubrick (The Clockwork Orange) brings this masterpiece of mental madness.  Nicholson is enthralling with his famous \\"Heeeeeeereeeees Johnny!!!\\" line.  The dvd version of the film is excellent, I originally saw this movie on VHS and it's transfer to DVD has resulted in a much clearer much sharper film.  This is old school horror, the way it should be.
0316098337|5.0|I've never read anything quite like this book.  I began it with absolutely NO information so didn't have any specific expectations.  I had read the sample pages on Amazon before ordering it, and found the child's perspective and unique word usages hard to get comfortable with at first, but ordered it anyway as my book group had selected it.  Getting used to the boy's particular vernacular took me about 1/3 of the way in to get used to, like reading Shakespeare or something written in regional dialogue. But well before that comfort spot came, I was hooked.  I was so curious to uncover the reasons behind the boy's perspective, and the meaning of the title.  As the mystery unfolded, I found both the boy and his mother were people I was increasingly  fond of, and respected their survival skills and \\"normalcy\\" in clearly abnormal if not horrific conditions.    Written through a precocious 5 year old boy's eyes, Room was a page turner tale of mother-love and how to be normal under severe constraints.
0316044695|5.0|This is an amazing story and one wonders if the correct decisions were made when the mission was compromised ? Would the ending have been different ? I was surprised that there was a lone survivor, and the circumstances that facilitated his survival were astounding. This was a very good book that tells a story which required telling. How many other stories are there out there that are un told ? There was bravery on the battlefield, but also bravery in writing the book. I wish that the ending could have been different !

B001UV4XWY|2.0|As a self proclaimed nerd, I've watched the new Twilight Zone (or the 80s) series and the original Rod Serling series. (nothing beat the original version.)  That said, this movie was originally a 1/2 long vignette entitled \\"Button Button\\" from the 1980's Twilight Zone starring Brad Davis (Midnight Express) and Mare Winningham.   I really enjoy James Marsden, Frank Langella and Cameron Diaz, but honestly, trying to make a 1/2 skit into a full length movie was a waste of time.  Don't bother to purchase it, rent it. Then watch the Twilight Zone version.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|There are very few works of fiction that deal with the brief and very interesting period in which the Greco Roman classical world was rapidly and sometimes violently replaced by Christianity: if you ask me quickly I can recall only some of the poems of Constantin Cavafy. Agora, directed by the Spanish Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar (who also cowrote it) tells the real life story of the Alexandrian philosopher Hypatia, one of the last platonic philosophers, who was brutally murdered in 415 at the hand of Christian monks followers of bishop (later Saint) Cyril.  Her story has always been almost too neat a metaphor of freedom and scientific inquiry being crushed by obscurantist theology, and as such it has been espoused by writers critical of religion (the first time I heard about Hypatia was when I watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos when I was 12 years old and reportedly director Alejandro Amenabar also first heard about her there).  Agora is certainly not subtle, but at least it does not underestimate its audience and is not afraid of being about ideas, refusing to water them down. I read negative comments by some classicists about the movie, and most of their criticisms are really nit picking (like, Roman soldiers are using uniforms of the 1st century instead of the fifth). Other common criticism is in the movie's imagining Hypatia as a precursor of the Keplerian system of planetary movement, but given that a lot of the science and philosophy of this period was lost with the burning of the library of Alexandria, and that geometry and astronomy of that era was quite advanced for the time, this scene doesn't seem such a terrible slip. If you read any biography of Hypatia, it is clear that the movie got the big details about her life (and the ideas she was espousing) right.  The acting is generally good: Rachel Weisz is good as the philosopher, but some of the supporting players like Oscar Isaac as Orestes (the prefect of Egypt and a former student and admirer of her thattry to protect her) and Sami Samir as Cyril particularly excel.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|As a fan of the \\"Saw\\" franchise I am aware that the whole premise is far fetched. That absence of reality remains true in this final (?) film, done in 3D. Since I just mentioned the 3D, I will say its not anything to jump up and down about. Pretty mediocre at best. The best way to approach a \\"Saw\\" film is to not question anything and just watch it for the torture scenes and gore. Asking where they got 50 old push lawnmowers isnt important. How any of these elaborate devices where built is irrelevant. Sure they've given bogus explainations in past films but, whatever. Jigsaw has become an iconic horror figure thanks to the voice of Tobin Bell and the eerie looking puppet that often delivers the tasks to the many victims through out the series. Many fans, I understand are glad its over. Was it necessary to make 7 of these films? Maybe not. But for horror fans, \\"Saw\\" marathons will live on for decades to come.<br /><br />Saw ****<br />Saw II **<br />Saw III ****<br />Saw IV ***1/2<br />Saw V **<br />Saw VI ***<br />Saw 3D ***
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I watched this miniseries faithfully every Sunday night on HBO.  I was a powerful depiction of the actions of the Marine Corps during World War 2 in the Pacific. Those guys deserve all the credit in the world for what they went through.  I was disappointed that there was really nothing about the US Navy's major contributionns to winning the Pacific War.  I suppose that did not lend itself to this particular series, which was following certain Marines during that island-hopping war.  I would like to see a series on the Navy in the Pacific War.  I would have given this miniseries five stars but for that omission.  It is well worth watching.

Con:  It can be challenging to read the time on it.    If your eyesight is excellent I would recommend this watch.  It is lovely and versatile and feels substantial and solid.  If you value function over form, this might not be your best choice.  There are other very attractive Swatches that are easier to read.  I love Swatch watches - would never wear anything else.  They make a quality, stylish product.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Like all the other ladies who supplied reviews, I am a diehard fan of SATC and enjoyed the first movie immensely.  Somehow the sequel just misses the mark, the script is horrible and the movie is a whole bunch of disjointed scenes that make no apparent sense.     I won't reiterate the entire story, but here's my take:    The whole gay wedding thing was useless and drawn out. I mean Stanford and Anthony hated each other throughout the entire series, then they have this big epiphany that they've been meant for each other the whole time? I mean what was the point, especially given the fact that we don't even see them beyond the wedding plotline.    The trip to Abu Dhabi took away from one of the most important characters in the series itself: the City of New York. Samantha is disrespectful and innappropriate with her behavior in a strict Muslim country, but somehow we're supposed to applaud her idea of feminism and her willingness to flaunt her aging sexuality? Honey you're fifty something years old, fondling your dinner date in a crowded restaurant is just pathetic. It just didn't make sense, an hour and a half of vapid luxury interspersed with lame social commentary.    I'm not even going to comment on the Aidan thing....    And Back to New York! Carrie realizes she was out of line and learned to value her marriage!! Movie ends.    It's time for these ladies to hang it up. They are no longer the hip, urban 30somethings. Their attempts at keeping up with the Cosmopolitan crowd have become sad. The series has aged badly, hopefully there won't be a third movie.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Once again, Bon Jovi can do no wrong.  This package is amazing and includes new songs that any true Bon Jovi fan will go nuts over.  \\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\" is basically the continuation of Tommy and Gina...talk box included.  A true \\"Bon Jovi\\" song.  \\"The More Things Change\\" is a good song regardless of the monotone beginning.  All in all, this is a must-have for any music lover's collection.
0143039431|5.0|No one really needs my opinion, this book is a CLASSIC.  I recommend reading all of John Steinbeck's books and short stories, especially this book.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is finest concert I have ever seen and I'm 57, so I've seen a few.  Joe Bonamassa is incredibly talented.  Someone referred his music to me about a year ago and I now have 9 CD's and 2 of his concerts on DVD.  He started playing at age 4 and the work he put in learning the guitar is very evident on this DVD.  I highly recommend purchasing this video.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This AmazonBasics \\"HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter\\" helped to solve my unsightly cabling issue on my bedroom HDTV. While I thought the cable jutting out and dangling at an odd angle down the side was just fine, the lack of it was the first thing my wife commented on after installing this adapter since the cable now runs discreetly down the back.<br /><br />The adapter is well made and it is very high quality all-around. It also does not seem to impact the audio or video quality in any noticeable way (at least to me).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
030014332X|4.0|Gombrich wrote this book in a very simple, yet sometimes childish way in order to make world's history entertaining for everyone. Although you'll probably feel as though your grandpa were reading you a child book, all the major historical events up to World War II are described and easily explained.  I recommend it in case you want to have a quick snapshot of history knowledge.
B002UJIY7A|1.0|Is there anything worse than a script that not only *thinks* it's smart, but then actually brags about it to the audience through one of its characters?!  Pathetic. I don't want to hear a character brag about a mediocre script.     This movie revolves around a big twist, which really doesn't come as that big of a surprise.  This film has very little rewatchability value.  Once you've seen the twist, that's it.  The rest of the film isn't very likable.  The characters aren't very likable.  The dialog is annoying.  The screenplay has a \\"better than you\\" attitude that really tries to talk down to the audience.  The camera work is dated to the year it was made.      Michael Bay is a name I avoid due to his superficial films.  Now, this writer/director is another name I will avoid.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Long story short: The effects are stunning but the story stinks like year-old hamburgers. It's the same tired old story we heard again & again. Overall,buy it if you are a fan of effects but don't listen to the story. I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|I bought this because I kinda like this movie even though it wasn't a big hit.  The special effects are wonderful.  My complaint isn't with the movie, it's with the design of the DVD interface.  I have a Sony player, and when it plays you have the commentary with the film and no way to shut it off.  I checked on the internet, and it said the disk is not compatible with some Sony players.  Really?  How do you make a menu, without the option to turn off commentary?  There is no \\"off\\" button.  Very disappointing that the makers of the menu could have been this careless.
B003YBNRHU|3.0|This CD is pretty solid. 5 out of 12 tracks are solid and possible 6th track.  If you download CD buy Tracks 1,2,4,6,8 & maybe 9 and forget about the rest.  Track 9 sounds like Santana with Rob Thomas Riff from 10 years ago.   I caught the Song \\"A Brighter Day\\" on Margaritaville Radio and that song got me excited about new doobies. Wish Doobie Bros. could have stuck with the Jimmy Buffett influence through out the CD but they did what wanted and it tended to downgrade the whole CD so I gave it a 3 Stars. To Bad could put the Best Songs from Cycles CD together with New CD and You would have a Gold Record.   Still glad the Doobie Bros.finally put out a new CD. To bad the Bands nowdays and in the past don't have their fans give them their opinion of each song before they release them on their new cd. If they did that they just may spark interest in new cd and sell more CD's ? What a concept eh ?
B0044E9LW6|5.0|Ronnie James Dio left a big empty hole in metal music when he passed away on May 16th 2010. Dio had quite a unique voice, it was operatic, powerful and quite impressive and unlike some singers he had this great voice right until his death. It's hard to describe just what Dio was and represented, he was a kind and generous man who cared about his fans, the metal movement and his music. He gave a lot to metal including the famous « Devil Horns » and to say that he was a huge influence on this genre of music would be an understatement. Ronnie was a man of great talent and was truly the voice of metal (at least one of the most important and powerful ones), he left us excellent music from his solo career and all the bands he's been in. I always had huge respect for Dio and I think that this live two-discs collection « At Donnington UK : Live 1983 & 1987 » is a testament of not only his talent but of just how passionate he was about music.<br /><br />The first disc is Dio's 1983 performance introducing his band to Donnington, Dio was know for his work with other bands such as Elf, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow and Black Sabbath (later Heaven & Hell) but this was his solo debut. The lineup for this disc is : Dio (vocals), Vivian Campbell (guitars), Jimmy Bain (bass), Vinny Appice (drums) and Claude Schnell (keyboards), this often considered the best era of the band and rightfully so. Children of the Sea is fantastic, Dio's delivery of the song is wonderful.Straight Trough The Heart is impressive, the long version of Heaven & Hell is great and Holy Diver is amazing, this is a terrific live version. They also included drum and guitar solos tracks which is nice for those who are fans of all that stuff, I don't think it's particularly great but it's cool to have.<br /><br />Disc two is Dio's 1987 appearance at Donnigton, there are 13 songs and the setlist here is a little different from the first disc. The lineup for disc 2 is : Dio (vocals), Craig Goldy (guitars), Jimmy Bain (bass), Vinny Appice (drums) and Claude Schnell (keyboards). The highlight for me is a very brief version of Children of the Sea (modified so it's different) leading to a short version of Holy Diver and then going into Heaven & Hell! That was quite a medley, strong energy in each progression and I simply love it and know fans will appreciate it as well. Terrific performances of Man On The Silver Mountain (amazing) and Rainbow In The Dark (great conclusion to the show and the crushing Last In The Line. To me, disc two is superior because of the sound, it sounds better than the first disc (which is still good) being much louder, clearer and therefore better.<br /><br />For a double live package At Donnigton UK is a deal, I expected it to cost more (I paid mine 14.99 at HMV, CAN price). This collection comes in a digipack format and besides the music it also offers a booklet with good liner notes which I thought was a nice touch, a little short on content but good. You also get two replicas of the Donnigton tickets, one is from the 1983 concert and the other is an all access pass, cool additions I must say. I didn't know what to expect in terms of sound for these live albums honestly and the sound is pretty decent especially considering the time and the venue, it sounds better at certain places and some places less so, it's live recordings after all we're talking about. Disc two sounds better than the first. Dio's voice sounds great and the musicians are good too, it's also nice to hear Ronnie interacting with the crowd (just enough interaction in my opinion, it's neither too much or not enough).<br /><br />If you're a fan of the man (and if you're reading this you probably are) you really should get those live discs, they truly are worth it. Dio himself was the executive producer of this collection which only helps the album's cause. Excellent price, two good live albums and one remarkable legend what's more to ask?  If you're hesitating...well don't! Fans may be interested to know that there are going to be more Dio releases in the future like the new live Heaven& Hell album from Dio's last few concerts ( also a live DVD) and his autobiography will be released in the not to distant future. I'll give this package 5 stars because of the deal that it is but this rating also applies to an objective perspective.going to be more Dio releases in the future like the new live Heaven& Hell album from Dio's last few concerts ( also a live DVD) and his autobiography will be released in the not to distant future.

0553805371|3.0|Synopsis    Two famous physicists set out to demonstrate that `philosophy is dead' and that physics can explain the entire universe.    Structure    This is a well-presented and beautifully illustrated book. It begins with the assertion that physics can explain all of mankind's important questions, such as  `Where did the universe come from?' and `What is the nature of reality?' As a consequence, and in their opinion, philosophy is dead. Such a statement fails to recognise the significance of any questions which can't be addressed by physicists. `What is a good life?' and `How should I live?' spring immediately to mind.    I quite enjoy a bit of arrogance and dramatic overstatement sometimes but this smacks of ignorance. It dismisses the value of anything which can't be understood by physicists and diminishes the impact of the book.     The book then provides a rapid and well-written overview of our understanding of physical laws, beginning with Newton and Maxwell and moving through to Einstein, Feynman and beyond. At this point I began to lose the plot, since I'm not a physicist. For example, an explanation of Feynman's sum-over histories of particles in the two slit experiment suggested that each particle takes every possible path in the universe between the slit and the screen. How this can happen in a finite time, given that the speed of light isn't infinite, wasn't touched upon and I for one was left uncertain of how this explanation improves the understanding of Young's famous experiment.    The book then describes something called M-theory but it's done in such an opaque fashion that I was left uninformed by the explanation. The most informative passage in the book, for me, was an illustration of why time has no meaning before the big bang. Just as you can't travel further north than the North Pole on the curved surface of the Earth, so you can't look further back in curved space-time than the instant the whole thing started. Finally we move to the answer tothe questions posed at the beginning of the book. There are an infinite number of universes and we just happen to inhabit one of the many in which the physical laws permit our existence. That's fine, and may well be true, but this explanation hardly constitutes the answer to all of the questions of philosophy.    Strengths    This is a well produced, well written and attractive book which includes a good summary of the major physical laws of the universe.     Weaknesses     The book failed to adequately explain M-theory and confused the inquiries of moral philosophy with those of theoretical physics. The authors demonstrate a degree of hubris and arrogance which doesn't engage the sympathy of this reader.     Conclusion    I enjoyed reading the book, even though I felt that it failed to achieve its purpose and convince me that physics can now provide an explanation of the universe. I think that the authors would benefit from getting out of their physics labs and maybe listening to some Beethoven.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I took a risk and purchased a used series, and when it came (2 weeks of waiting), it was obvious that it was not in its original packaging.  The pages of the book had been photocopied and some were even put in upside down.  Several of the disks skip or don't work at all.  I will never purchase anything from this person again.

My bad fortune to have recently seen Lee Child profiled on CBS Sunday Morning Show, having never heard of him before, and gone to the library to find one of his books and chosen this one.  Really, really lame.  No doubt he has written better ones and I might try one of his earlier ones.  Any recommendations?
1591841666|1.0|Having heard the name Seth Godin repeatedly and having read some of his blog posts, I was given this book to read. I wasn't looking for a motivational book, but boy was I disappointed.     This comes across as someone writing for writings sake. The ideas are simplistic and obvious and unoriginal - his concept of The Dip is not unlike the The Chasm proposed by Geoffrey Moore.    The basic take home of this book is: It's no good being average, you need to be the best, and to be the best you need to know when to push through the dip (i.e. difficulties and obstacles) and when to quit.    I wish Seth had taken his own advice and left motivational type books to those who could be the best at writing them. The references are shallow and the arguments lack insight and practical advice on how to effect the change. This reads as a long blog post lacking in substance and written to meet some sort of scheduled output target. I couldn't even force myself to finish it.    Save the trees - this isn't worth the paper it is printed on.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|DVD set came in great packaging with a brief description of episodes on the back of each DVD case.  I selected the \\"Grey Box\\" based on other purchasers reviews, and I'm glad I did.  The only concern is that one of the last DVD's on season 1 stopped reading halfway through. I took out the DVD and it was filthy and greasy.  It was taken right out of the case new, so I checked all of the DVDs and found 3 more filthy greasy ones.  They were easy to clean with a felt, DVD cleaning cloth however.  I very glad I made this purchase.  This series was a masterpiece in story line and character development.
0765326353|3.0|First off I listened to this book on audio tape (unabridged).  I did not read the physical copy of the book, so there may have been extra stuff in the book like maps or pictures, that I didn't see.<br /><br />I broke down below, what is good, bad and ugly about this book.  But to sum up, if you don't want to read my book long review, don't read this book for good dialogue, clever insight, philosophy, or multi-dimensional characters.  Read this book for the battle sequences, the cool new world the author has created, and the intrigue and mystery you will find in its pages.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Mr. Sanderson does a great job at building a new world, with exciting new possibilities.  He goes into a lot of detail, from currency (an important detail) to plants, to city designs, to values in different socieites.  When you are reading, you get the impression that the history books referenced in the Way of Kings actually exist.  And the fact that he starts off many chapters with quotes from books, helps more completely draw you into this new world.<br /><br />Sanderson also does a great job of building a lot of mystery and intrigue.  There are a lot of mythical heroes/villains from the past (the heralds, dawn singers, radiants, voidbringers, etc.) to keep you curious.  I think its clever, that Sanderson creates only a few characters who actually believe in these mythical heroes/villains, while most educated people see them merely as myths.  This helps build the suspense and anticipation in the reader - are they real or not?  what are they like if they are real?  what powers do they have?  why did they dissappear? - that helps keep you interested.<br /><br />The last 200 or pages or so is exciting.  Sanderson does a great job of building the suspense and delivering a good emotional payoff - the flashback to Kaledon (sp?) watching his brother die, is brilliantly placed by Sanderson, right before Kaledon finally explodes into action.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />The story of Shallon is very tiresome.  She thinks she's clever, but she comes across as an annoying know-it-all teenager, who really isn't as clever or smart, as the author thinks she is.  At times I remember saying to myself, please, please just kill her off.<br /><br />Kaledon's story is by the far the most interesting in the book, but Sanderson bogs it down in flashbacks.  Some of these flashbacks are helpful, and necessary, but most are annoying and hard to get through.  Furthermore, Kaledon's story goes on life support in the middle of the book.  Sanderson seems to have wanted to torture his readers and make them feel like they were on the bridge crew too.  I kept telling myself, escape already!!  I can't take anymore of your whining about everyone dying around you!  I almost didn't make it past this part.<br /><br />Dalinar's story is also really drawn out and annoying, until the end.  Much like Kaledon, Dalinar also spends most of the middle of the book being uninteresting and whiny.  Only in the end does he start to get interesting.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />The dialogue is painful most of the time.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|This is how Eccelstons Doctor should have been written. With \\"Rose\\" it was good to have the Doctor back on air but I felt nothing for Rose or for that fact, why the Doctor was interested in her. The love story angle was painful like watching Lucas(George) writing the love story of Anakin. I digress. Amy Pond's story drew me in and having seen Matt Smith's earlier works, liked him then and his approach for this Doctor. I remember how many of my friends and other Whovians dislike David Tennant only to love him as their Doctor. The same is for Matt. He is a good actor and great supporting cast. And the writing ... the writing is fantastic and doesn't leave me confused as RTD's hackneyed style.  I cannot wait for the future seasons of Doctor Who with Matt at the helm. He'll only continue to go up from here.  Sidenote, I am an old Whovian fan watching Pertwee and Baker (Tom) who is my Doctor. He is still no#1 with Tennant next and Matt edging out McCoy slightly.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|This is a great music association, there might be bad critics but to hear this kind of music nowadays is pretty hard and even more if it's played with heart and soul like BCC does. Glenn Hughes is in great shape, his voice is still strong and with a lot of feeling. \\"Black Country\\" is a great song as the opening for the album, it's like a combination of early Maiden with Zeppelin, \\"Down again\\" could have been a Trapeze song and not to mention the recreation of \\"Medusa\\" which is great and it's played with the original Mel Galley's guitar (from Trapeze). It's been said that they are in the works for a follow up from this album, I'll be waiting for it.
0345441184|4.0|The first time I read Mists of Avalon as a nineteen year old college student. I have always enjoyed reading about the Arthurian legend and I love mythology. This combination, along with my recent interest in the fantasy genre, sparked an interest in re-reading the Mist of Avalon a second time and I enjoyed this second read even more.    The Mists of Avalon tells the Arthurian legend through the eyes of Morgaine of the fairies and half sister of King Arthur. The story centers around Moraine striving to serve her goddess and the religious struggle that ensues as the old ways of the Druid priestesses clash with the new Christianity that beginning to take hold, by force, via the Crusades. The core of novel is conflict and loss; it's an excellent take on the Arthurian legends and understanding of paganism as a religion to be understood and appreciated.     Marion Zimmer Bradley was a gifted and imaginative writer, she was one of the very few female authors that does service to this genre.

1439152780|5.0|Okay, that infamous line is never used, but it might as well have been.  There WERE plenty of dark and stormy nights in this deliciously atmospheric novel of suspense.  Like Ms. Morton's previous novels, this is a tale told in two times.  The \\"contemporary\\" story is set in 1992, and events are set in motion by the delivery of a letter 51 years late.  Protagonist Edie Burchill is visiting her parents when the letter arrives, and she witnesses her mother's unexpected and unexplained emotional response to the missive.<br /><br />Questioning her mother, Meredith, Edie learns for the first time that her mother was evacuated from London during WWII.  For over a year, she lived in the country with the sisters Blythe and their elderly father at gothic Castle Middlehurst.  Meredith is inexplicably reticent to discuss her past.  This is merely one more example of the distance that Edie has always felt with her mother.  Edie finds the incident odd, but it fades quickly into the past--until months later, lost on a road trip, she stumbles upon Castle Middlehurst and her curiosity is fiercely awakened.  On a whim, Edie arranges a tour of the castle and discovers, among other things, that all three sisters are alive and in residence.  After several introductory chapters setting up the story, the book moves back and forth between Edie's answer-seeking in 1992, and chapters set during the actual events that occurred between 1939 and 1941, seen from the POV of several of the story's participants.<br /><br />There is SO much more to the story told in this epic novel.  The Blythes are a literary family, and patriarch Raymond is the author of the children's classic The True History of the Mud Man that inspired Edie's love of literature and eventual career in publishing.  Ms. Morton is a brilliant story-teller and knows exactly how to torture her readers with questions.  What was in the letter Meredith received half a century late?  What was the true inspiration of the Mud Man?  Why is the parlor door kept locked?  What was in Raymond's will?  What really happened that night in 1941?<br /><br />So many questions.  And Morton teases us along for hundreds of pages, stringing along answers like breadcrumbs for readers to follow.  Kate Morton is very, very good at what she does.  Though, after three novels, the similarities in the types of stories she tells and the themes therein have become quite evident.  She's going to need to shake things up before she starts to recycle too much.  But for now, The Distant Hours is hard to beat for good old-fashioned entertainment value.  It literally brought chills and goose bumps to my skin time and time again.  Savor it on a dark and stormy night!kept locked?  What was in Raymond's will?  What really happened that night in 1941?

B0044E9LW6|4.0|I've always loved Ronnie James Dio. His contributions to whatever project he was involved with pretty much guaranteed excellence at the highest level. My only problem with these disc's and I emphasis it's my problem, is that I'm not a fan of medley's at all and these discs are full of them. I'm the guy who would rather hear half of the songs in their entirety than little samples of all of them. The track listing is deceiving as some of these tracks are only a minute or two as part of a medley. At one point he sings a verse from Temple of the King (one of my favorites from Rainbow's first album) but that's it; just a little tease.     I cannot say anything bad about RJD as he will always be one of my favorites. Listening to these does bring back the power of those early Dio albums and the impression they left on me as a young metalhead back then. Great stuff for sure, I'm just nitpicking.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|Avatar is a great movie and James Cameron is great too. I gave one star is to this Blu-ray release of the movie.    As a big fan of the movie Avatar and the director JC, I really want everything of the film. That's why I feel a bit sad for their releases \\"plan\\" of this film.    I read quite a few of reviews/comments saying people were stupid because they did not pay attention and bought the first release in April and whine now. I don't think it's fair to call the fans stupid... Yes, I did know their plan of releases in advance as they announced before the first release. But that does not mean then they are innocent. If you do remember there were lots of criticism/complaint/mock over the internet of how greedy the studio was when they initially exposed the release plan. That's why director JC had to come out and explain.    As big fans, especially my son, just can not wait for another seven months when he saw the first Avatar release already on store shelf in April. To me, their release plan is a test of the loyalty of fans, a game to test human nature of balancing sense and sensibility. It was a painful, struggling process to decide what to do at that time. Should buy? Should wait? As a dad and a fan, what would you do?    That's why I feel sad... I was feeling sad since April since I knew the fate already. I felt a bit being ripped off. Now with another 3D version release coming in next Spring (some said this December with Panasonic 3D TV purchase), do I have to buy one more time?    (PS: Luckily I have access to 3D TV sets.)
B0043GAZYS|5.0|So when i saw this film in theaters i knew i would buy it. I didnt care about the features or whatever. I just knew i loved it. So now i bought it on Blu-Ray and i am pleasantly surprised. The disc is packed with extra features and fun stuff that is definitely worth the money.
0525423842|4.0|I didn't realize this was a book for younger people when I bought it.  It seemed to be lacking in some of the nuances and humor that John Grisham typically uses.  When it dawned on me that this was a book for a different demographic, I appreciated its content and saw its value.
B00445JSX2|5.0|this is a great 4 dvd/cd set for DM fans looking to relive their moments from DM's awesome tour of the universe.  the first dvd contains footage of the entire concert, the second contains a documentary including rehearsals and bonus tracks.  the 2 cd's contain full audio tracks that are very high quality and suitable for listening to in mp3 format.  if you enjoyed the tour then this set is for you, if you missed the tour then you can see why every show was sold out across the world. DM is one of the best live bands ever.
1439152780|4.0|Edie is an editor at a small publisher. Edie's mother, Meredith, was evacuated from her family in London as a child during WWII to stay with a family in a rural area, the castle Milderhurst. One day, a long lost letter is found and delivered from Milderhurst to Meredith and it makes her cry. Edie takes it upon herself to dig back in time to discover her mother's past and to learn about the girl her mother used to be. In the process, Edie finds out much more than just her mother's past. She also discovers the history of the Blythe family and the castle Milderhurst.    I am not a fan of stories that jump back and forth through time and back and forth from different perspectives. It takes a while for me to adjust after jumps and there are quite a lot of jumps. The chapters are numbered in a particular way that might provide clues to the reader, but I didn't even notice the peculiar numbering until the middle of the book.     The author made the castle Milderhurst magical in a beautiful way. It wasn't paranormal or necessarily haunted by a ghost or a wizard/witch/vampire/etc. For one, it was simply beautiful in the way a young girl innocently dreams it to be. For others, the castle is confining with dark secrets.    I was struck by how deeply the author portrayed the complicated family relationships both in Edie's family and Blythe family. I could feel the tension in the air when they had disagreements and I felt like I knew them.    The end of the book just flew by for me. This isn't a light and fluffy book. It's deep and a bit dark. It has its share of sadness as well as happiness. After I read a quick happy book, I look forward to reading Kate Morton's other books.
0316069884|5.0|This is a startling book from a talented author.  We shall see in which direction the world goes as more and more people see the environmental and economic impact of eating just veggies, or just grains, or just fish from the sea or animals from the land.  Can the earth can support \\"all organic\\" gardening/farming?  If pesticides, herbicides, and engineered seed can triple or quadruple yields (and feed four times as many people), how do we balance organic and green farming with population growth?

B002ZG980U|1.0|I just watched this movie and found it to be the most confusing, boring film i have ever had the misfortune of viewing, beginning from the very first scene when we see our hero Leonardo lying on a beach to the next scene where he is being interrogated by an extremely old Asian man all the way through to the last scene we are expected to follow a storyline so convoluted and filled with so many characters that we can't really know whose \\"dreams\\" we are really watching, I was so disinterested i wanted to leave after the first 30 minutes of excruciating confusion but i kept thinking it would get better - it never did, i ended up watching the whole movie but now realize it was a complete waste of 150 minutes.
0143035711|2.0|The early part of this book was informative on how the hueys flew and what you had to know to fly them. Some of the early narrative covers the authors clearly courageous action in the Ia Drang battle at LZ X-ray...although poorly compared to Hal Moore's classic. From there it is downhill and soon degenerates into a lurid tale of hookers and booze and shenanigans.  Sorry, couldn't finish it. Thanks to the author for his service...in a later part of the war I was one of the grunts in the back of the Huey. Still have a ringing in the ear from the door gunner's muzzle blast on a combat assault with the 101st Airborne.
B0041CGP02|1.0|I can't believe these guys are still around. Of all the crappy hair bands, these guys were the most embarrassing. Completely talentless. Jon Bon Jovi has a horrible voice. The song writing is utter garbage - cliche after cliche - not one interesting or creative thought to be had here. This proves that mediocrity and marketing to the lowest common denominator is what sells CDs. Disgusting. Not even worth 1 star - couldn't publish the review without rating this slop. All of these songs are crap.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great movie that makes a viewer ponder it long after it is done. Nothing artificial. Much better than \\"Following\\" for thoughtful cinema. Great action as well. Best movie of the year.
B002ZG974M|3.0|I don't think any man can enjoy this movie. I give it three stars because it has a lot of nudity. The worst part was the hippie moms in San Francisco chanting \\"Earth is our mother.\\" One positive thing is that after watching this movie, I will never have sex without protection again. They should show this to all 13 year old boys to scare the living bejeezus out of them.

B00006AW2P|2.0|Despite unquestionably being one of the greatest rock bands of all time, the Stones had a rocky start. Recorded in an era when recording music written mostly by others was considered acceptable, this album contains of only one original composition. The problem is that even at this early stage, the stuff they were coming up with was miles ahead of the what they were covering.    Now it's not all bad. 'Not Fade Away' is a great Buddy Holly tune, very catchy and fitting for the band. And even though I'm not a fan of 'Route 66', it's not a bad track for it's time. The band's own song, 'Tell Me', was good enough to be released as a single and shows that they are superior to their heroes. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is basically a waste of time to any but the most die hard Stones fans, or fans of primitive blues rock. Granted, 'Carol' is a decent song, but tracks like   'I'm A King Bee' and 'Walking The Dog', however much the 'classic' term is thrown on them, are nothing more than musical drivel. It's nearly impossible for me to sit through such boredom. Thankfully The Stones themselves, as well as Zeppelin of course, would revolutionalize and revitalize blues rock.    I can't not recommend this album. The worthwhile tracks should be sought after elsewhere, this makes it good beer coaster but nothing more.
B003ZSH606|5.0|Coming from a longtime Jamiroquai fan, this album is quite GOOD. After listening to it a few times it just gets better and better. If you're a fan of Jamiroquai I'm sure you've already bought this album. To new fans tracks 1&2 may be the songs that hook you in; while tracks like \\"All Good In The Hood\\" , \\"Blue Skies\\", and one of my new favorites \\"She's A Fast Persuader\\" will keep you coming back for more. FYI if you have the opportunity you must see Jamiroquai play live, they throw a DANG GOOD concert!!!    P.S. If at all possible, get your hands on the Japanese version or U.K. 2 Disc version, as the added tracks are fantastic; and the track \\"That's not the Funk I want\\" is TO DIE FOR!!! It's a raspy Funk Odyssey of a song, a spiritual successor to Deeper Underground...
B00006AW2O|3.0|This is yet another album from the Stones primitive blues phase, and while it is yet another album filled with covers of artists of far lesser talent, this one is actually pretty solid overall.    'Time Is On My Side' and 'It's All Over Now' are definately timeless classics, the Stones make these songs their own easily. Another track that no mentions is 'If You Need Me', which might even be my favorite. A rare blues gem, this is one that people that aren't even fans of the genre should check out. The band once again shine the most while showing off their own songwriting talents, 'Grown Up Wrong' & 'Congradulations', while not even coming close to showing what the band was fully capable of, are still great windows into their ancient period. Unfortunately, a significiant amount of this album is subpar,  with songs like 'Susie Q', despite fitting with the bands style, are still far below them at the same time.    Unlike ENH, this album is worth checking out on it's own for a few songs that you probably won't find elsewhere. This is definately the gem out of the their first 3 American releases.

B0041T52S6|5.0|I saw it three times in the cinema. I'm not sure I can remember the last time I did that with a film. And why?...    We live in a time of depressing films. Really, think about it. This whole decade has been one miserable story after another. So much so that Hollywood have started trying to recreate some 80's type thrills (Expendables etc, and lots of sequels, prequels and remakes), because the movie going audience is wondering 'Why don't we have FUN movies anymore?'    Well, Scott Pilgrim is fun as it gets. And what's so brilliant, is that whilst it panders to nostalgia, it doesn't do it in a fake imitating way, the film is completely and totally new. It isn't like The Expendables, wishing it was an old film. It's a new film, and proud of it, and it takes a master director to pull off something so fresh and different with complete, flawless control. Every shot, sound and moment is precise. That's what film making is about.    Just see it. Seriously.

0789318245|5.0|This book is awesome...plenty of \\"olde tyme\\" tattoo flash for reference. People talk about \\"old school\\" all the time and don't really know what they're talking about...this book is entirely compiled of the original old school style flash and not awkward modern reinterpretations of it.     The drawings contained in this book were created by self-taught untrained artists who only had a limited range of subject matter to emulate and execute. Many of the drawings may seem a bit rough and primitive but remember the art of tattoo has only recently been adopted by the fine arts community and this book represents the traditional artwork of tattooists in the early part of the twentieth century...in it's completely unadulterated form without the self consciousness of modern art. This book is a must for the serious collector or general enthusiast of classical European/American tattoo traditions.
0316098337|5.0|I loved this book - mulled over a lot of it for a couple of days after finishing, before I could choose my next read - well written, makes you think - and then re-think. I have recommended it and then shared it with at least five people so far!

0823095223|5.0|I spent about ten years of my life writing and helping to promote popular collectibles from action figures to resin busts.  It's very easy for an outsider to be dismissive of the art of such things - who didn't own a Princess Leia action figure that made her look more simian than human.  But the truth is, the mass manufacturing process means that sometimes a lot of detail gets lost.  Certainly in my time I saw the standards of sculpting rise from the barely acceptable to the truly stunning.  I dare anyone to walk into the Four Horsemen's studios and look at the Masters of the Universe 2-Ups (basically a prototype at twice the finished size) and not have their breath taken away.    Tim Bruckner is one, if not the best, in the business.  He's a pro's pro - a sculptor other sculptors look up to.  If you've ever seen DC Direct's Alex Ross-inspired Justice Line you can see a lot of his best work.  In fact he's worked on a lot of DC Direct's properties bringing various comic artists' drawings into the 3D realm.    So now Tim has teamed up with Zach Oat of Toyfare fame and Rubén Procopio (Electric Tiki amongst other things) to bring us the definitive book on creating action figures and statues.    You'd think with the number of customizers and people wanting to break into the industry there would be a wealth of books on the subject, but this is the first one I've ever seen, and frankly, after being amazed by how comprehensive it is, I don't think another one is ever going to be needed.    What's stunning about this book is the level of detail.  It goes into everything, filled not just with information, but tips as well.  It starts with looking at the art reference, goes through the sculpting and casting to painting and ends with tips on going pro.  Gorgeous photography detailing the various processes sit alongside little cartoon asides that not only raise a smile but raise pertinent points.    If you've ever marvelled at the level of art in an action figure or bust, thenthis is a fascinating book even if you have no intention of ever sculpting yourself.  You can just dip into it and always come back with some new piece of knowledge you never had before.  But if you're into customizing and hoping one day to turn it into a full-time job then this book is a god-send.  Seriously, in ten years' time I reckon this will be THE textbook every sculptor learns from.    As someone who worked on the fringes of the industry for ten years, it's an incredible book.  For anyone looking to get into the industry I'd say it's pretty much damn well essential.
0596806027|4.0|This book is but an introduction, but it's a good discussion of what's up in HTML5.  Mark Pilgrim does a good job discussing how HTML 5 can work. He goes through the various proposals and discusses compatibility with different browsers. Also goes into video codecs, which was useful, and provides a lot resources on how to safely implement HTML5 in the near future. Unfortunately, as HTML5 is such a fluid \\"standard\\" there isn't a whole lot that's actual practical for implementation. I'm glad I read through this book - got it from the library - but it's not something I'd add to my library.    With everything changing so quickly, the digital download is probably a better bet than the book. The companion web site is also useful.
0811870413|1.0|Tartine Bread- A Dissenting Viewpoint<br /><br />I have had my copy of Chad Robertson's \\"Tartine Bread\\" book for some time now and have read the posts here from those who have baked his breads. As has been pointed out by other posters, 100 pages are dedicated to recipes that use bread in them which is nice but isn't normally part of a \\"Bread Book\\". It is a beautiful book and the images take up many of the pages. The book was delayed in publishing for what seemed like forever. Several critics gave it rave reviews so I was hopeful.<br /><br />The text is written like it is aimed primarily at new bakers or those who have heard about the bakery in California and want to learn to bake the Tartine breads. The author talks about how anyone can pick up this book and make good bread using just the chapter on the Basic Country Loaf. Robertson details his basic formula and attempts to de-mystify bakers math so you learn to \\"think like a baker\\". The working formula for building the leavan calls for double the amount needed in the dough build. Then his representation of the recipe or formula is in my opinion very non standard and confusing. Additionally the discussion of bakers percents and the listed percents do not add up correctly with the amounts in the formula. The total hydration of his basic country bread is off by the amount of the leavan. The total amount of flour is also off by the amount of the flour in the leavan. I wonder if he really understands bakers percent math. Small mistakes are one thing but any professional baker would be or should be embarrassed by this interpretation of bakers percent math. A new baker will gain nothing useful by the confusion created on pages 47) para 1. and page 48. In addition the percent for salt is shown to be 2%, which is a common ratio for that ingredient but then since the flour in the leavan isn't included in the total flour, the amount shown in under the salt column is off by 10%. That mistake won't ruin the bread but, the instructor/author should stay true to the universally accepted use of Bakers Math.<br /><br />The concept of baking in a cast iron combo cooker is in my opinion, an accident waiting to happen. While covered baking has been demonstrated to be an effective way to avoid the venting issues in a gas oven, the weight of a dutch oven at scorching 450F heat being held upside down is very difficult to manage. Yes, it can be done but the results are attainable using any one of many far safer methods. Remember the book is aimed at folks who have never baked bread. Even the famed \\"No Knead\\" breads only have you removing a lid on a dutch oven.<br /><br />The one redeeming component of the book is the discussion of managing fermentation to manipulate the outcome. The idea of using the leavan prior to it's maximum activity is interesting. I made the basic country bread yesterday and found it to be demanding. The fermentation time for my room temperature was 5 hours, during which I had to stretch and fold every 30 minutes to build the gluten strength. The proof time ended up being 4 hours before I finally called an end to the wait and baked it in 2 sessions under a clay le choche bell cooker. I left the second loaf in  the oven unmolested for the full 20 minutes after removing the cover and got a darker color. The first loaf, I checked a few times and rotated the loaf which looses a lot of energy.<br /><br />I like the bread. A good crust and a moist crumb with mild sour flavor the first night. It's hard to say for sure but I'm not sure the starter feeding schedule lowered the sour notes. It's about the same as usual for my regular Pain au Leavan. I might do some further experiments with controlling fermentation and using the starter before it is at its maximum ripeness. This is the only area of the book where the method put forth is new and unique to me. This is an advanced technique in my opinion. It's difficult to determine how far along the activity has progressed by using your sense of smell. Waiting for it to begin to fall is at least a stage most people can understand, and knowing your starter will double or triple in a given length of time is quantifiable.<br /><br />I don't want to be taken as a mean spirit here. But. I feel  a responsibility to speak the truth where it conflicts with normal conventions. I appreciate that it is hard to get a book published and off to market. In my opinion this book is not for a new baker and maybe not for anyone who is just learning to bake with sourdough. You have to be experienced enough to know on your own that the formulas are all wrong. At the least you have to know that every other bread author in the world uses bakers math in a different way to arrive at a final dough. The in depth description of all of the phases of baking are well written and helpful but the basic concept of using bakers math is flawed. There are many good books on the market to help aspiring bakers learn the basics. Reinhart's \\"Bread Bakers Apprentice\\" is one, and Hamelman's \\"Bread\\" is another to name the first that come to mind. Daniel DeMuzio's \\"Bread Baking\\" or Dan Lepard's offerings are some others who are well known and follow standard conventions. In conclusion, my advice would be to pass this book over. Its basis is factually sloppy and the method is unnecessarily difficult.I don't mean to be harsh but, it is what it is. Lots of good books out there to choose from.
031606792X|5.0|the book and delivery time were excellent.  Had the book included a dust cover - it could have been described \\"like new\\".
0143113100|5.0|I am only quarter through this book because I am reading other book too. I had read \\"Inside the book\\" on the Amazon site before buying it. I was convinced it is what I wanted. There could be a mystical book that would describe miracles of \\"The brain that changes itself\\". But I didn't want that. I wanted something that could help me understand and help the neurological cases that my neurologist sends to me. This book does that. My advice is that read Inside The Book on Amazon for buying any book.
B001AQR39O|4.0|A few reviewers have opined that the second season isn't as good as the first, and I cannot disagree with them.  However, the quality has gone down just a notch.  I finished the second season enjoying it quite a bit.  It is cleverly written and the actors/actresses are appealing.<br /><br />Hank Moody has a more stable love life in the second season (I'm trying not to put any spoilers in this review, unlike other reviewers...that is so annoying!), but he continues to be frustrated with temptation after temptation.  His agent has problems of his own; he's patched things up with his wife, but now she comes down with problems of her own.  And his second masterpiece is still hijacked by a former (child) lover...<br /><br />The writing is snappy and often quite funny.  Hank's daughter Becca is still a cipher, and underplayed in an appealing way by Madeleine Martin (I can't figure out if she's just extremely talented, or if she's just not involved very much in the role).  Mention must be made of Pamela Adlon, who plays Hank's agent's wife, Marcy Runkle.  Pamela is very, very funny, and very, very real.  I watched one of the DVD bonus features, which gives Adlon a chance to comment on one of the episodes.  She doesn't have a lot to add to the information of the episode, but she comes across exactly as she does when she acts in the series.  Her very real acting is almost like not acting at all.  Evan Handler plays Hank's agent Charlie Runkle, who has a few problems of his own.<br /><br />The result is a very funny comedy that is not safe for children under the age of, say, 25.  It's not a production you are going to chat about with the more prudish members of the family.<br /><br />But, it is funny and, thanks to the snappy, rapid-fire dialog, a cut above most cable efforts.<br /><br />Recommended.  Four-and-a-half stars for the second season of 'Californication'.  However, be aware there is very rough language, sexual situations, drug use, and nudity.  But, it's all in (pretty much) good fun, and nobody gets too badly hurt.too badly hurt.
B002XTXFU8|3.0|Most people who know me know that Charles Bronson is pretty much my hero. Based on everything incredible the guy's done single-handedly: punching through bulletproof glass, doing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to jail roofs, evacuating an entire prison when he took a teacher hostage, and his many records on push ups and sit ups...the guy is a legend. I've read a few of his books, and follow his Solitary Fitness program as much as I can. It took me a while before I watched the movie, since the trailer I saw wasn't exactly captivating. But after reading many reviews about how 'captivating' and 'amazing' this movie is, I finally gave it a shot. Let me tell you that if you watch this movie without any knowledge of Bronson himself, you're not going to get much out of it. And if you've read his books about prison life and how he's managed to get himself thrown back in time after time (in his book, Bronson), you'll probably wonder why the director and writer chose to skip over all the interesting parts of his life and decide to make a tribute to Stanley Kubrick instead.    Because we all know the poor guy's still in prison, and that's where most of the movie takes place, it's hard to give a plot summary, especially given that there's no real plot. We start out with a brief background of Bronson's child life, showing that he wasn't abused or neglected by his parents or anything. He was just a ruffian from the get-go. Later on he robs a shop for very little money (I'm talkin' a few bucks here...well, pounds since he's in England) and ends up in jail for a few years. While in prison, Bronson makes a name for himself. Constantly fighting guards, beating up other prisoners, taking hostages, etc. He's moved from prison to prison and eventually to an asylum where he's drugged up, then moved to another prison and set free. But once he's out, Bronson robs another store, and goes back to prison again, starting the cycle all over again.    See, it sounds like it should be interesting. And I wasn't going into this movie expecting an action/comedy or anything, though when I was done watching it, I think that might've been a better genre choice than what they went with. The movie misses everything, and ends up being more of an art house kinda deal more than anything. It's for the kind of person who watches A Clockwork Orange repeatedly, or tries to make sense of the stupidly little details that will never be explained in The Shining (omg why are there two coffee cups on the hotel manager's table before Jack gets his own?!?!). In the movie, it's hard to care much for Bronson since most of the time he's moping around or going crazy beating people up. Here and there, the movie cuts to scenes of him talking to an audience while wearing face paint and a nice suit, giving a brief narrative of what's going on or his thoughts. The problem is, after reading the book Bronson, this doesn't seem like it's the right guy. In the movie, he goes off about how he loves prison, but in the book, he constantly goes on about his miserable he was and how he desperately wanted to do things that we take for granted, like walking on grass or running on the beach. Is there anything like that here so we can identify with him, or make him seem more like a human? Nope. Even the part where he's drugged up in the asylum, which was a VERY big low point in the man's life, is over with in no time, and the scene's handled in such a bizarre way that I don't get why they even bothered to put it in here.    Another thing that bugged me is how they didn't show anything regarding Bronson's superhuman feats. There are a few brief seconds of him doing push ups early on, but no mention of how many he can do. I know it seems petty, but read up on the guy's fitness regime and you'll see why it would've been nice to see something more than him punching guards for 5 seconds, talking to a dream-audience, or an awkward scene of Bronson visiting his uncle in a room full of womenand men dressed as women, as he sits on a couch with no one else really saying anything, having a fancy drink. See? It's -art-! There's no explanation but since it's art, it must have some deep message that only the highly intellectual person will understand, right?! Had they tried to make this more of a biography movie, I would've handled it better. But as it stands, the only good things I can say about it are that Tom Hardy does resemble Charles a bit (though I don't get why he didn't dye his mustache black) and he got into very good shape for the part. That and some of the music is good. Otherwise, there's nothing I liked about this movie at all, and it hurts to say that about something based on the legend. I was never that interested in the movie, and wished it would end within the first 20 minutes. Stick with the books. At least there the scene where he fights a dog isn't cut off as soon as the dog's unleashed- there he straight up tells you about how he crammed his arm down the dog's mouth and ripped out part of its lung.    The picture quality of the blu-ray is average. The movie's shot in a gritty style to match the content, so don't expect this to look as pristine as some of the newer movies where everything looks flawless. I actually saw some white spots on the print in some scenes too. The audio's a bit better, and makes great use of the DTS track, though this isn't an action movie that could use it to the full capability. The music and ambiance really sets the mood in some scenes that are otherwise dull. Whenever Bronson paces the cell in his chains, you really feel like he's circling around you, with the clink-clink-clink going around.    The extras are surprisingly good, starting with an audio recording from the real Bronson himself. It plays for almost 20 minutes, and the kicker is that prison guards didn't know how it got recorded since visitors are heavily searched and remove nearly everything upon talking to him. What's funny is that if you listento this right after watching the movie, you'll see that Tom Hardy doesn't really sound like Bronson that much. Then there's 48 minutes of interviews with the director, writer and stars that cover nearly everything you could want to know about the making of the movie, almost like a commentary track. There's a standard making-of feature, the trailer and some b-roll footage, nothing special. But my favorite feature aside from the audio recording is the short Training Tom Hardy extra. It goes into detail about how he trained for 5 weeks to get into as good of shape as The Bronco.    All in all, the blu-ray might be fairly good, but the movie isn't. I'm sure I'll get comments with people telling me that I didn't 'get' the movie, but I really don't care. It was uninteresting and didn't capture the essence of the man. A gentle giant on one side, zero tolerance for being pushed around on the other. Again, I highly recommend at least reading his Solitary Fitness book to get a better idea of how strong the guy is, and reading the book Bronson to see that the guy isn't dull like he is here.
