6303998704|4.0|A young woman finds herself pursued by evil spirits who want her to come to a ghostly carnival after she \\"survives\\" a car crash.  <br />Spooky little film was made on a shoestring budget, and is now considered a cult classic. Candace Hilligoss turns in a wonderfully bizarre performance as Mary Henry. Gene Moore's organ score is very creepy. Inspirational to such films as \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"The Others\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" Recommended!
B00005N7Z1|5.0|So read the tagline for the movie.  Actually, from the number of body parts that were replaced, he was almost all machine--but who's quibbling.    Cyborg storylines are common, but no one has done it better than Paul Verhoven did when he made this satirical look at virtually every facet of a possible future.  It is unfortunate that studio execs, in their neverending pursuit of the almighty dollar, chose to make a number of progressively disappointing big-screen sequels as well as a couple of abysmal television series based upon the character.    Peter Weller, then a newcomer to the acting scene, is cast as Alex Murphy--a Detroit Metro police officer, family man, and all-around good guy.  In attempting to apprehend the city's most wanted man, Clarence Boddicker, played with chilling effectiveness by Kurtwood Smith (Red Foreman of \\"That 70s Show\\"), Murphy is \\"killed\\" by Boddicker and his gang of psychopathic thugs--only to be reincarnated as the movie's title character.  Although Murphy technically died, a few residual memories coupled with a few chance circumstances, set the Robocop on a collision course with gang responsible for the demise of his human side.    The movie is broad in both its dark humor and its violence, with the latter being over-the-top at times.  Interspersed throughout the movie are \\"commercials\\" that further indoctrinate viewers to the sarcasm of the age being presented.  Although presented almost as a spoof of cop movies, the film keeps the viewer's interest by focusing on Murphy's attempt to hang on to the tatters of his remaining humanity, smart dialogue, fabulous action scenes, and a satisfying ending.    The supporting cast is impeccable and includes Dan O'Herlihy as the grandfatherly Chairman of OCP (the corporate \\"inventor\\" of Robocop) with a vicious streak in him; Ronnie Cox as Dick Jones, the Senior Vice President of OCP and an even more vicious SOB; Miguel Ferrer (now of \\"Crossing Jordan\\") as Bob Morton, an ambitious junior exec who makes the fatal mistake of crossing swords with Jones; and, finally, B-movie scream queen Nancy Allen, as Ann Lewis, Murphy's ever-devoted partner who inadvertently sets the Robocop on his current path.    Of course, you also have ED-209, a security droid whose cute exterior belies a murderous nature directed at anyone that stands in its way.    Great lines:    \\"Your move, creep.\\" --Robocop (pointing his gun at a thug, after castrating the thug's partner with a precisedly aimed shot)  \\"Dead or alive, you are coming with me.\\" --Robocop  \\"Come quietly or there will be...trouble.\\" --Robocop  \\"I'd buy that for a dollar.\\" --TV Game Show Host  \\"You call this a glitch?!\\" --O'Herlihy (to Jones, after ED-209 obliterates a company exec during a droid test)  \\"Give the man a hand!\\" --Boddicker (to Murphy, after he blows off the latter's hand with a shotgun blast)    By the way, despite the comedic nature in which some of violence is presented, this film is most certainly NOT suitable for viewing by children under the age of 15.    Classy in its own way...and classic sci-fi.

B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music is one of my all-time favorite music groups, and that's saying a lot. Avalon is one of my two favorite albums out of all the music I have listened to in my sixty plus years (The other is George Harrisons's \\"All Things Must Pass\\").  There isn't one song on the album I don't like, but a few are really special. \\"More Than This\\" is outstanding, and \\"Avalon,\\" well it conjures up images of mists on grey waters in some remote and fantastic place, and I am drifting away....All in all, one of the things I love about this CD is it is MELLOW, a kind of music to soothe and relax one. There is a lot of beautiful music out there, and I rate this at the top of my list.

0441172717|5.0|Dune is an epic masterpiece by Frank Herbert.The story begins on the planet Caladan in the year 10,191, home to the House Atreides. Duke Leto, the head of the House Atreides has been named governor of the planet Arrakis, where the majority of the story takes place. After a collapse of House Atreides, his son Paul is taken in by the Fremen and given the name Muad'Dib. By harnessing the powers handed down to him by his Bene-Gesserit mother, and the focusing effect of Melange, the spice of spices that is only found on Arrakis, he challenges his enemies to try and take back his father's throne. This exciting science fiction novel will have you reading it multiple times, and keeping it close on your bookshelf. <br />    I Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction, and especially to those who enjoy stories such as The Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, and even Harry Potter. Truely one of the greatest works of fiction of our time.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|I bought this disc the day it was released, and I've figured out how I can best think of this disc. I think of it the way I think of a Grateful Dead studio studio album... nothing all too spectacular, but a nice way to learn the new tunes and guess how this stuff will be worked into the concert repertoire. Part of the reason I view this album like that is because Erykah is explosive in concert, particularly from 2001 to February of 2003... a much different beast from what you know if you only know her live performances from the Baduizm era.<br /><br />Part of what bothers me about this disc is the production. For this one, the analog girl in a digital world clearly went all digital all the way. For instance, the icky sounding synth-horns on Danger. That is quite a disappointment, especially when compared to the outstanding sound (and charts) of the horns on her masterpiece (so far), Mama's Gun. Also, there is that non-musical, digital gurgly thing that pops up occasionally on this disc. Maybe that seems really trippy to some people, but to me it just sounds like someone was trying to fill some sonic space. I'd suggest Zeena Parkins or Nels Cline to Erykah if she truly wants to experiment with the amazing possibilites of sound and noise.<br /><br />Like I said though, I put alot of that aside and view this album within the greater context of the Erykah Badu universe, which to me means the quality of her studio albums and how they add to her concert performances. Love this album or hate it, in 2003 and 2004 Erykah and her band were KILLIN' on every version of I Want You that I heard her do. Her Live band grooves wonderfully all through the tail end of that tune and Erykah and her back-up singers sing the life out of it. They just totally get into bliss-factor mode on this tune in concert. It was the highlight of the concert the last time I caught her in Indy in early 2004.<br /><br />Think Twice on this album has a great, understated break in the middle (what I call the \\"I Really Love You groove\\") that I was dying to hear her and her band expound and jam on in concert, but they didn't play that tune. Seriously, if you haven't caught Erykah in concert from 2000 up until now you don't realize what her and her band do... masterfully seguing in and out of Parliament and Marley grooves. Old-school hip-hop classics appear and disappear into nothingness. Drastic, gorgeous and/or rocking rearrangements of Erykah's own tunes, etc... They are a monster unit in concert... a groove-symphony, with Erykah serving as the ultimate High Priestess and conductor. She also has great flow and a load of attitude when she raps, which makes The Grind a disappointment here since she isn't the one rapping. If you take this album not as an end in and of itself, but as a handful of groove tunes to be mixed into her concerts, you get a nice little prize. Back In The Day (Puff) for instance is a great little tune for early in the concert to get everyone warmed up.<br /><br />If you already love Erykah's music then you know you want to hear this anyway, just to find out what it's like for yourself... so buy it. But if you're brand new to Erykah, yes I'd point you to Baduizm, Live, and Mama's Gun first.<br /><br />Most important of all, Erykah is only human. No, I do not think this album has the lyrical depth, musical brilliance or great sound that her first 2 studio releases had, but I haven't lost any faith in her and I think her next release may very well equal or surpass anything she has done so far. Thank you for everything, and lots of love (((Puma and Erica Wright)))!<br /><br />And check your town to see if Erykah is touring near you in September! I know Chicago and Philly are two of the cities on this mini jazz-festival tour.call the \\"I Really Love You groove\\") that I was dying to hear her and her band expound and jam on in concert, but they didn't play that tune.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first watched this show I was put off by the whole notion of space-cowboys, which has been done before. After a couple of episodes, however, I realized what a truly unique and great show this really is. The actors are excellent and the world they inhabit is truly interesting. While all of the wild west cliches are here--the noble southern rebel, the kindly prostitute, the preacher, the city doc...etc. They truly become unique characters in their own right that you come to care about and want to see what happens next. This show was shorted on publicity because many did not know how to take this show. It's great!! I can't wait to see it on the big screen!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I wasn't always a big fan of chick flicks, but after viewing this, it just makes movies like Bad Boys, The Matrix(Reloaded and revolutions), and Blade, look like boy scouts.<br /><br />After being kinda dissapointed with Jackie Brown, I was wondering if Tarantino was falling off a little bit.  I saw a trailer for this movie, and all the swordplay I saw on it, was calling to me.  I was hoping this wouldn't turn out like another Jackie Brown.<br /><br />Quentin creates a powerhouse, packed with comedy, action, and blood and gore.(They used over 450 gallons of fake blood to make the movie)  It's not a huge plot, but revenge is all that was needed to be said to put this gory tale in motion.<br /><br />This movie takes kick-@$$, blood, gore, and chick flicks, to a level only explored in this film.  If you love blood and gore, blades, action, and Quentin Tarantino fils, this films calling for you.  If you action, and love plot, look elsewhere.<br /><br />peace

B00005JMUA|4.0|After kill Bill Vol.1 it was just outrageously violent(just the way I like it)  and pretty funny too.  I was anxiously awaiting Kill Bill vol.2.<br /><br />After a the day it came out, my friend said it stunk because it had hardly any violence.  I decided to check it out anyway, I thought maybe it had a story.  So when I checked it out just like my friend said it was low with voilnece, but the plot was the movie's saving grace.<br /><br />Kill Bill vol 2 totaly fills all the voids that it's predicessor had.  You find out all the answers to the questions Kill Bill vol 1 left you with.<br /><br />This movie still has it's moments of violence, but only few people die, compered to the 74 that died in Kill Bill vol.1.<br /><br />Altho I usally prefer violence over plot(Ex. John Woo movies), this movie also had a touchy side to it, which got me a little, but not much.<br /><br />Those who loved Kill Bill vol 1, but are expecting all violence and gore, and no plot, will undeniably be dissapointed.  Those who want a sequal to cherrish as part of the saga will surley be appeased.  If it wasn't for my friend, libaly, I'd be dissapointed just like he did.<br /><br />peace
B0000524CY|4.0|My dad is a Roman Catholic and to this day he refuses to watch this film. I'll occassionally suggest that the family sit down and pop this film into the dvd player and in return I will get a scowl from my father while he says, \\"That film is an abomination of the devil!\\"  <br /> <br />This film is creepy. This film is also shear genius and an art onto itself. The green pea soup and head spinning has become synonymous in our every day vocabulary that is associated with this masterpiece of a horror film.  <br /> <br />The underlying theme is a vulnerable Meghan, a tortured soul that internally wrestles between the forces of goodness and evil. We are given glimpses into the holiness of the Church, superstition into the unknown, fear of the inevitable, the monsterous and supernatural power that is potentially in each and every one of us, and the doubt of all that is good in this dark world.
B000268QB2|3.0|Keane is a majorly successful rock band in London now hoping to achieve that same success by crossing over into America. Sound familiar, say Spice Girls or Coldplay perhaps? Anyway, it's a shame that the band won't see the same numbers here that they will see overseas. I happened to see a music video for \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" late one night on Vh1 and after having the song in my head for a few days I opted to buy it. Keane, who at times closely resemble fellow Brits Coldplay, have a great album to back up the lead single. \\"This is the Last Time\\" & \\"Bend and Break\\" are my choice for follow up singles and the album's best track is \\"Can't Stop Now\\". I also thoroughly enjoyed \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Untitled 1\\" & \\"Bedshaped\\". The album slips up a little bit during the middle which is why I can only give it 3 stars. Still very impressive release.
B00028HBKC|4.0|This is a film that will stand up to the test of time like all of the biblical greats such as 'The Ten Commandments'. In twenty years I guarantee you that this film will be remembered as a golden classic. And I rarely say that about a film. POTC is special, different, and it draws on the pathos within us all. <br /> <br />Keep in mind that this film is not for everyone. This is only an interpretation, in this case by Mr. Gibson of what Jesus' final hours of life were like. Anyone who instantly denounces this film for it's context has a narrow mind. Like any film, the channels of awareness should be made available to us as the audience, not limited to just the message that the film is trying to make.  <br /> <br />Finally I commend Mel Gibson for attempting such a daring and controversial feat to recapture the life of the most important human figure in Western history- Jesus Christ. Everything from the costumes, the score, the language (in sub titles), and the acting were impeccably done. Mel Gibson is a one of the faithful and a believer. Kuddos to you Mel! <br /> <br />For all of you that complain and whine about the grotesque and excessive violence in this film, then simply do not watch it. No one is making you or punishing you by watching The Messiah being whipped and beaten to utter death. Walk away!  <br /> <br />The theme that I have recieved from watching this film is not one of anger, hate, or vengeance, but one of indebted thanks and love for the holy sacrifices that Jesus gave up for all of humanity over 2,000 years ago.  <br /> <br />Film is unquestionably art. This film is art whether you like it or not!

B00009UW0N|4.0|John Carpenter carried on the horror traditions of Alfred Hitchcock, however, he took the genre to a new and sensational level.<br /><br />What Carpenter is trying to deliver and suggest in his masterpiece is the dehumanization of the individual. The audience is given flashes of the psyhosis, the danger, the unmerciful terror, and the pent-up anger inside of a little boy that slipped through the cracks in life, becoming an all out monster in his adulthood.<br /><br />John Carpenter relies on the trusted styles and art of Hitchcock-- the unique angle of the camera as well as the light and shadows throughtout this overly 'dark' film.<br /><br />And then we have an unforgettable performance given by a very young Jamie Lee Curtis. Her piercing screams, her predictable crying, and who could forget that torn silk blouse that she wore and mussied up blond hair.<br /><br />The musical score is perhaps one of the best, if not the best aspects of this horror film. The sequence and repetition of the score is appropriately placed throughout each scene, from the xylophone medley in the opening scene to the pounding of the piano keys during the actual process of 'stalking.'<br /><br />History has given this film a place in the horror genre. Just as Halloween had carried on the traditions of Psycho and Rosemary's Baby, no other film after Halloween in 1978 (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, etc.) achieved the success of accomplishing the absolute emotions of fear, terror and suspense, showing nothing more than a mixture of filthy gore and a blood bath.
B00006879E|5.0|Songs About Jane is certainly no plain Jane and it stands out among those mainstream pop albums you hear. As a whole, all the songs are really great and you get hooked to it after a few spins. It's true cos I have this personal experience. When I listened to the album for the first time, I found Adam (the lead vocalist of Maroon 5)'s vocal very special and just wanted to listen to it over and over again. It's rock music with a very gentle touch, and easy to listen to. It's really hard to pick out a few favourite songs out of the album cos every track is just so awesome. But, if I really had to choose, it'd be... <br /> <br />She Will Be Loved, Harder To Breathe, This Love, Sunday Morning. <br /> <br />This album is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to everybody reading this out there.  <br /> <br />
0783225849|4.0|This film is Alfred Hitchcock's signature classic. Unlike many horror films that have tried to emulate his style, no particular director (give or take John Carpenter) has successfully copied Hitchcock's special way to capture a scene on film. The shadows, illusions, and the eye of Hitchcock himself behind the camera angles are all what contributes to the notoriety of what entails each and every film in the horror collection of Alfred Hitchcock.  <br /> <br />Indeed, this movie was considered horrific and downright shocking for 1960's standards. But times have changed since most audiences expect a horror film of downright gore and an all out blood bath.  <br /> <br />The shower scene is fantastic. We all know and can anticipate what will eventually happen, but 'when' it will exactly happen is what drives us as the audience into suspense and pure fright! Hitchcock embellishes our fear a step further by omitting all sound and musical score whatsoever. Just the hissing of the water coming out of the shower is enough to make our imaginations run wild. <br /> <br />Other Hitchcock films which I suggest are The Birds, Dial M For Murder, and Vertigo. <br /> <br />This Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece is essential for any horror afficionado as it ranks with the best of the best-- the Hammer Classics (Monster films), John Carpenter's Halloween, The Exorcist, and Pit and the Pendulum.  <br /> <br />
B00001OH7P|5.0|.... it took me this long to buy this cd. I grew up knowing Bowie as an art-rocker who sometimes scored a hit dance single -  a song  that I'd hear at the roller rink in the  mid seventies. Fame , Golden Years,you get the idea . When I first heard this in its entirety , on cd, with earphones, I was blown away. Incredible. It deserves its legendary status.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys has proved that new school can make good music if they want to.  I LOVE this cd!!  It's one of the best out this year.  The songs on this cd has a old school flava to it.  Although I like all the songs, my favorites are \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" and \\"Feeling You, Feeling Me\\".  She reached DEEP into her soul for these!!  This is a must have!!!
B000005S0E|2.0|Too much acid. Too many distracting, outside projects ( touring and recording with Siouxsie and the Banshees, recording with the Banshees' bassist Steven Severin as the Glove ). Writing and recording pretty much as a solo artist at this time. Just too much of the \\" too much\\" . The Top is the Cure  at its most unsure, its most disjointed, unfocused, and least successful. <br />The  single the Caterpillar is a likeable,  folk-popish , quirky English love song. And the title track is an emotional, rhythmic  dirge on par with the title track from the Faith album. The remainder, however, is dense, difficult to listen to, messy,and maddeningly lethargic. The few of the songs from \\"the Top\\" that show up on the import cd \\"Concert\\" sound MUCH better, full of the energy, and vitality they lacked on record, especially Shake Dog Shake and Give Me It, both of which rock surprisingly hard. If you MUST have it, wait until it is re-released next year, it might have a few extras on it that will make  it more worthwhile.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I really like this album compared to her first one, however, you'll notice that chantal kreviazuk and raine maida helped write a lot of her songs, and the style is exactly the same as their stuff...which is good, but she's not them. <br />
B000002H2Z|4.0|This is the sound of the Cure knocking on mainstream America's door in hopes of an answer. After suffering \\"oscure British new wave/ pop-rock- art \\" status for the first few years of their existance, they presented a trio of Ultra-Pop singles ( Let's Go to Bed, The Walk, and The Lovecats ) along with some silly videos,  finally exposing  them to a ( limited ) US audience that was hungry for something new. This is the sound of an \\"all Cure for all fans\\" sound. A few still exhilerating singles ( InBetween Days, Close to Me ). A few punchy pop/rock/electronic tracks  ( the excellant Push, the Baby Screams and the down-right freaky Screw.) A few somber moments ( a Night Like This, featuring some  fine sax work  from Porl Thompson,  and Sinking, which is incredibly sad, and reminds me of something from Faith or Pornography).Rounded out by a few experimental works, ranging from the Flaminco flavoured \\"the Blood\\" to the Eastern influenced \\"Kyoto Song.\\" this is, in a nutshell, the head on the Door.  You could go wrong with other Cure albums only because they mostly contain song cycles which tell a story or set a mood through the entire album ( as in the above mentioned Faith and Pornography.)  This is the first album they made that is as varied musically as it is, but  really works as a whole, and doesn't sound like a compilation disc.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I was thinking about only putting 4 stars but I decided on 5 with an Asterisk... This DVD is AWESOME... especially due to the fact that it put back the scenes that were cut out of the VHS version. BUT unfortunatly when they put in the cut scenes they took out the Subtitles that were in the VHS... so to get the full feel for this movie you really have to get both versions... the DVD and the VHS (this is the reason for the asterisk). But this movie still is one of the best ever... and here is proof... I have owned this movie myself 4 times on VHS (It was stolen from me or loaned out and never returned all four times) and now I own it on DVD (Never to leave the house again!!!). So if you are looking for a well thought out, acted, directed, and realistic Latino movie you must watch the rest first because after watching this one the rest are going to pale in comparison. Well that is about all I can think of... I hope it was helpful for you.
B00009L1OB|2.0|...people are giving this cd such a great rating. Even as a fan I felt let down by it. The music is forced and over-produced, the lyrics are awful,  the cover is absolutely appalling. The Union of the Snake , despite its high chart position, is a horrible single,with overblown (pardon the pun ) sax solos and pretentious, art-school lyrics. New Moon on Monday, another charting single, is equally grating.  Just dull. I can't believe this is the same group that gave us \\"Hungry like the Wolf\\" \\"Girls on Film\\" and other energetic, rock meets pop -meets dance -meets electronic songs. The only song I really like on this cd is  The Reflex, and it  had to get a total make-over (  courtesy of a remix  by Nile Rogers, with whom they would later work, with much succes),  to become a hit -  the band's first #1 in the US. I also quite like the instrumental Tiger Tiger ( ironic, as it  isn't saddled by vocals ) . The only other decent song to come from these sessions is Secret Oktober, which was bumped to a b-side and should have been on the album.
B000076CY6|5.0|My kids have been playing with their Lego's as long as I can remember.  This is a good set to start off with, for the basics, and you can always add on from there.
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's not the self absorbed lyrics. It's not the ridiculous attempts at rapping. It's not the over-reliance on squiggly synths and Vocoders. It's not the bare bones production ( although the acoustic guitar with minimal synth thing has been done to death.) It is very simply the total lack of memorable melodies and the glaring and obvious lack of hooks and catchy choruses that made American Life Madonna's least successful album commercially and critically. Pre-release hype insured that enough copies of this were shipped to retailers to get this terrible album to the top spot on Billboard's album chart. But word of mouth spread quickly, and for once the public and the critics were in agreement, and this was avoided like the plague.It slipped off the charts within a matter of weeks and it barely went Gold. BARELY. I'm thinking the real reason Madonna did those embaressing Gap commercials with Missy Elliot was not to enhance her \\"street\\" credibilty or to expose herself to a younger audience, but to make enough money to pay her record label back the advance it gave her to make all those tacky and expensive videos for the singles that all stiffed. Madonna has settled into comfortable middle age, has married a much younger British man and has moved to the country to live the simple life. But does that have to mean she is unable to write decent pop songs anymore? If she doesn't get herself back on track and find a new co-producer and a new co-writer, I am afraid her career as a musician will be over and she will become just another \\"celebrity\\", someone who is famous simply because they were once famous, but still manage to get themselves into the tabloids. I'm thinking the bloated, aging Elizabeth Taylor. I'm thinking the oft-married to gay men Liza Minelli. Or the pulled way too tight Joan Rivers. Scary, isn't it? This album is just a total drag for this Madonna fan, someone who has followed her every move since the Holiday days. A complete disappointment. And girl, my patience is wearing thin.
B00028HBKM|1.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, I really thought it was horrible.  But, I decided to give it a second chance on DVD...it was even WORSE!  Here's the thing on this film, it's done based on the fact that we know who all of these characters are-NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?? I'd expect a lack of character development in a porno, but not something that is supposed to be so \\"moving\\" and \\"important\\".  So, yeah, I realize that most people know the story of Jesus and all that stuff...and I know the story, but this movie really didn't sell it for me.  Oh, and let's talk about the \\"gore\\" in this film...oh please!!!  The original Exorcist had better gore effects than this film!  With such a huge budget, you would think they could afford something better.  This movie sucked on so many levels, I can't believe I wasted four hours of my life on it!  And, just like the kids from South Park, I think Mel Gibson owes me my money back!
B00006BNDI|5.0|Wow... I have just played this masterpiece through and I have never heard a more atmospheric black metal album.  It is the coldest, most desolate-sounding piece I have ever been witness to.  It makes Agalloch sound like summer beach tunes, and makes Dimmu Borgir and Children of Bodom sound like carnival clowns (wait... they sound like carnival clowns anyway).  Varg blew away anything by his friends in Darkthrone with this album.  I didn't think it could get much better than his \\"Burzum/Aske\\" LP + EP, but I'm inclined to say this one is.  The opener \\"Det Som en Gang Var\\" is pure brilliance, while the closing \\"Tomhet\\" has a beautifully grim aura to it.  The other two songs are masterfully executed as well, and fit in properly between the two longer songs.  I highly recommend this to any fan of good music.
0393035158|5.0|No Faith, no Religion, no Political System has so much overwhelming proof that it can be used to justify killing those who do not believe. The Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, The Communist Manifesto are not evidence; they are not proof that can be used to validate any religion or political system.<br /><br />Sam Harris' book is a cry against the wind, a voice of reason against the insane, hurricane forces of blind, ignorant, religious fervor. Faith is not a reason for killing anyone. Faith is not reason.<br /><br />\\"End of Faith\\" recounts all of the horrible crimes that have been committed in the name of faith, in the name of God, against innocent people. The book also makes a brave warning: Muslimism threatens the peace of the world, threatens the lives of every human being in the West, and threatens to impose its belief system on every country in the 21st Century by the use of force and murder in the name of God -- for what? Words in a book? Prove the Koran is the word of God! Prove that the Bible is the word of God. You can't. No one can.<br /><br />\\"End of Faith\\" is an important book. Please read it.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album is political fire and brimstone compressed into easily the best Cd to come out in the last ten years. All twelve songs leave amazed at what you can do to create something so audibly beautiful. De la Rocha spits out whatever he wants with a rage not seen in a singer in a long time.  Guerrilla Radio and Ashes In The Fall left me wanting to make my own band. Buy this CD and cherish it for the rest of your life. And Sow me something better than this. You can't.
B00003CXCT|1.0|In 1997, the idea that George Lucas would create Special Editions of the original Star Wars trilogy was greeted with much applause. After all, technology had changed so much in the span of twenty years that these restorations were necessary.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, as fans of the original trilogy discovered, Lucas didn't stop there.  That content was changed (added, removed) from such classic films created quite an outcry. <br /> <br />Needless to say, Lucas defended his position as the \\"filmmaker\\" and claimed such changes would have originally been made if time and technology had allowed.  I doubt Richard Marquand and Irvin Kershner would agree.  <br /> <br />Sadly, some fans feel the changes better connect the seriously inferior \\"new movies\\" and the original trilogy.  Sorry, folks you are really missing the point. (Should Peter Jackson tailor his LOTR trilogy areound THE HOBBIT cartoon?) <br /> <br />Suppose FF Coppola were to insert a digital Sofia into the original \\"Godfather\\" for some reason, I'm sure \\"Sacrilege\\" would be shouted long and far.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The dumbo Amazon.com critic writes, \\"To anyone who TRULY understands what it means to be an American, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 should be seen as a triumph of patriotic freedom.\\" Duh, like what is the Amazon.com reviewer suggesting? That anyone who regards Moore's film as a pack of lies doesn't \\"truly\\" know what it means to be an American? He's probably one of those idiots who believe that anyone who questions the \\"facts\\" of Moore's films are suggesting he didn't have the right to make it. He had the right to make it, and we have the right to criticize it and to criticize him. That's called freedom of speech, but the Amazon.com reviewer probably regards it as censorship. Get a dictionary, you damn fool! <br /> <br />Space is limited, too limited to counter Moore's film point by point, but I wouldn't do that anyway. I've read reams of articles about both the film and Moore's other works (including his books) and anyone interested in knowing the truth can get off their lazy behinds and do the same. The fact is the man cannot be trusted, and even those who share his political idealogy know he's a fraud and condemn him for it. Moore discredits the very people who champion him with his lazy and/or inept research, and his all too obvious lies.  <br /> <br />Moore is an overgrown child with a blind hatred for authority figures. This film is nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of an incorrigible twelve year old giving his teacher the finger to win the admiration of his classmates. Moore's hatred of George W. Bush may even stem from the fact that the Bush family was instrumental in getting Moore's filmmaking career off the ground (read the story on Moore in the current - as of this writing - Rolling Stone). He now bites the hand that fed him, perhaps because he resents his indebtedness to them.  <br /> <br />To those of you who blindly accept what Moore says, learn to think for yourselves. Moore is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and he'll devour you and your pet causes, not George W. Bush. <br /> <br />On top of all that, the film is shoddy. The guy can't make a competent film, yet he's an Oscar winning filmmaker. He's a mediocre writer, yet he's a bestselling author. Now THAT'S something to criticize about America: the fact that people with no taste can make a success of a man with no talent.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Whenever you make a film about Jesus, you're gonna piss someone off.  No matter how good your intentions are, some group is gonna get angry be it Jews, Catholics, Methodists, Moonies or Voodoo Witchdoctors.  Mel Gibson knew this before he wrote one word of the script, yet he pressed on coz he really wanted to make this film.  Most of the reviewers here are using this review forum for some kind of religious debate rather than reviewing this film for what it is: A Film.  You can whine about how accurate you think this film is, but bear in mind that this is not a documentary, it's a dramatization.  Remember watching Rescue 911 or Forensic Files and they would show you the dramatized re-enactment of the crime?  That's kinda how you have to view this.  It may not be a play for play of the way you believe the crucifixion went down, but it's probably pretty damn close.  Remember, this is a film based upon a book.  Any translation of a book to a movie gets a little jumbled-just ask Stephen King-and I don't see why the bible should be an exception to that rule.  Most people interpret the bible differently, so there's another reason why this film doesn't seem quite right to you.  Ya know, the bible is not a novel and isn't the best book when it comes to description and detail, so it's only logical to fill in those holes with what you feel seems most appropriate, and I'm sure this is what Mel did.  You'd do it to, and probably alot differently than most other people.  People have been whining about the violence as well.  Well, this film is about the crucifixion of Jesus, is it not?  Candy coating this event is okay to a two year old child(I went to a Lutheran preschool that had lots of pictures of a smiling cartoon Jesus caricature hanging on a cross), but we're adults here and we all know that getting beaten to a pulp and crucified isn't PG-13 material, especially when you think of the way the ancient Romans must have done it.  Before I saw this I was led to believe that the film was nothing but a 2 hour beating and an onslaught of gore.  I won't downplay the violence coz it is very violent, but there's really only one major beating scene that goes on for some time.  There's various beatings along the way, but one major bloody one, and it begins about 50 minutes into the film.  If you watch alot of horror films it may not be as shocking to you as with most other people.  Anyhow, with all religious philosophy put aside, I'll say the movie is good.  It's very well done, the performances are all good, the music is good.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie as a movie because that's what it is-A Movie.film was nothing but a 2 hour beating and an onslaught of gore.

B00003CXCT|4.0|The DVD's are alright.  Nothing amazing there.  The main thing is that it is nice to be able to watch the good Star Wars movies without worrying about the wear and tear on my copies (though it is somewhat disappointing to see that only the new edited versions are on the discs and not the originals as shown in theatres during the original release).  That is really about all it offers though in my opinion.  If you are a real die hard fan and can still watch the movies today then I would recommend picking up a copy.  If you're more of a lay fan then I would wait it out a few years and get the full box set of all six films (even though the last three likely aren't going to be quite worth owning).<br />The extra disc is kind of nice.  Though for most die hard fans you have probably heard about or seen a lot of those materials on many web forums (not in their DVD form of course).  The demo for the Xbox is rather entertaining, but of course limited to those that actually own the Xbox.  The other main extras are of course the various commentaries.  If you find those interesting then maybe its worth the buy, if you tend to never bother with those, then again, perhaps wait for the full box set to come out later.<br />Incase he ever reads these reviews again, to the fellow that was wondering why it took so long to release these onto DVD, all I have to comment is, try working in the industry for a while and you might understand.  Post production, marketing, business plans, etc., they take time (until you work in the industry you will not properly understand how long that can be sometimes).  Furthermore, the motivations of corporations/people may not always be clear to the masses.  Their is a method to the madness though (even if it seems like lunacy to most...and sometimes it is lunacy and companies go bankrupt...however I don't see that happening to Lucas Arts or ILM anytime in the near future).
B0000028MA|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and a fan of grunge rock in general, so I really tried to find something I liked about this CD, but I just can't.  The Pearl Jam and Smashing Pumpkins tracks are enjoyable to a small degree, but even they're not that great.  In my opinion, the CD doesn't really stand on it's own without the movie.  Unless you're the anal-retentive grunge fan who has to have every album, I can't recommend this record.  Sorry, but that's how I feel.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|I have been fond of Alan Parsons' music since the beginning.  When I first heard Pyramid, I was immediately hooked and grabbed their previous albums (Tales & I Robot) along with any new project that was released.  This includes Freudiana (his final collaboration w/partner Eric Woolfson), his 3 non-\\"Project\\"/Woolfson albums (Try Anything Once, On Air, Time Machine), and even the post-split musicals by Eric Woolfson (Gaudi, Gambler, & Poe).    Since then, I have subscribed to an Internet newsletter (APP digest), met the band members in person, and well... the rest is history.  That said, I can also attest that I had the advantage of knowing inside information about the band dissolving, and that Alan Parsons was going to take a very different direction.  Having the opportunity to hear some exclusive sound clips before the album's release prepared me for what was in store.  Otherwise, I would have likely been disappointed myself.    From a technical standpoint, this work is probably the best engineering Alan Parsons has ever done.  This includes Dark Side of the Moon, I Robot, Tales, Stereotomy, you name it.  The sound clarity & ambient effects present here are nothing short of incredible.  While this isn't a fair comparison (today's gadgets have a significant credit to this), one thing remains consistent:  Alan Parsons undeniably has a talent for pushing the envelope.  He has done this for over 3 decades (70's, 80's, 90's, & 2000's) yet seems to always be at the top of his game.    It wasn't until I heard \\"A Valid Path\\" through a nice set of headphones that I realized how great this album really was!  It was completely a \\"Night & Day\\" experience for me.  The best analogy I can come up with is the difference in quality of the album's first track WITH David Gilmour's guitar solo (\\"Return to Tunguska\\") versus the song it once was WITHOUT it (\\"Antartica\\").    THE BOTTOM LINE:    This album is not a set of orchestral rock tunes.  Instead, it's a sophisticated and masterfully crafted listening *experience*.  The entire album contains so many subtle sonic effects and musical passages that can become completely lost on most stereo equipment.  Because of this, the investment of quality equipment is essential to getting the maximum enjoyment out of this CD.    A Valid Path is ambient, somewhat psychedelic, yet also contains the same layered instrumentation all of us have grown to love with AP's classics.  The idiosyncrasies on this album continue to shine and please every time.  I believe Alan Parsons has broken the mold again and has redefined the \\"rules of music\\" with this release. It's electronic, it's progressive, it's new age, it's got a splash of everything.  A Valid Path is a valid masterpiece and another creative gift from a man who makes music that is often proved to be timeless.

0743490304|3.0|Deception Point I thought would of made a great suspense novel if Dan Brown did not talk about the F-14 Tomcat where it has ski's? And where the bad guys shoot ice bullets which are just as deadly as real bullets? Come on, no such thing exist. I am a teck-junkie and there are no such things as ice bullets and a F-14 Tomcat that has ski's. Anyway, the book is about a meteor in the North Pole where a team of NASA scientist are uncovering it, and when the main heroine Rachel Sexton comes in and discovers that it has life! Back in Washington, a Presidental candidiate who is denouncing NASA as being a waste for the tax-payer, and talks about how he wants to downsize NASA and get rid of it once and for all. But they are not the only ones who knows about the meteor. A group of Delta (now that is real) forces are on the ice ready to quiet them about what they found, then things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />Note that I didn't finish the book because most of the book was slow, and the ski's and the ice bullets just made me mad because in the beginning of the book there is a message saying that everything with all the technologies are fact, which I know are not. If you want to read a good novel, read Digital Fortress.

B0002I831S|5.0|This set is great and I am glad that Paramount finally got around to releasing these complete season sets of TOS. Of course, resident scumbags Berman and Braga are making a fortune off of people...did anyone expect anything less? These two would screw their own mother out of a dollar. Though I will say, the packaging for TOS is far superior to the rather mundane Voyager plastic garbage cases.
B000268QB2|5.0|This particular band really is an aquired taste. When I listened to this album for the first time I couldn't tell the difference between the second and third song. Upon a third or fourth listen though I happened to fall in love. I'd only bought it because I'd seen the video of \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on VH1 and liked the kind of whimsical sound (not to mention it was cheap) but I am so glad I did. The songs do tend to sound a little a like but you have to learn to appreciate each for it's own beauty, and they all have a lot of that. Tom Chaplin's tenor really is quite moving and unique. There is a lot of lush sounds from the piano and sounds they've used to fill in for the guitars. I definetly recommend it to anyone who wants something new or beautiful.
0312263120|5.0|Dan Brown has written a good one that should keep you on the edge of your seat. Susan Fletcher, chief cryptographer with the National Security Agency, is alerted when the NSA encounters a code that the Agency's powerful code-breaking computer cannot break. This is bad, but things get much worse. The code is part of an assault to obtain all of America's secrets. The key to the code is on a ring worn by the code's Japanese inventor. But he has just died in Spain, and no one knows what happened to the ring. Susan's boss sends linguist David Becker to Spain to find it. As Becker follows the ring's trail, he becomes the target of a killer. While Becker runs, followed by a string of murders, murder also invades the National Security Agency, and outside forces steadily breach its multiple defenses that guard every secret America posesses.

0375422307|5.0|In \\"Persepolis,\\" Marjane Satrapi writes a fascinating and moving memoir of her childhood in Iran, a country torn by uprisings, war, and political and cultural upheaval. She has written this graphic autobiography as a testament to her beloved Iran and as a remembrance of those who have suffered, lost their lives, or fled their homeland due to war and oppression. She says that \\"One can forgive but one should never forget.\\"<br /><br />The story opens at Satrapi's birth under the Shah's regime, and follows her life through Iran's revolution, conversion to an Islamic regime, and war with Iraq. A precocious single child of progressive activist parents, she is a witness to the complications and contradictions of Iranian daily life, both private and public. She recalls the first day the girls are forced to wear the veil at school. Through a child's innocent eyes, she describes her fears of the imprisonment, torture, and execution of friends, family, and neighbors, as well as of the bombings, oppression, and harassment that have become part of the fabric of her life. In spite of the turmoil, the author is a typical adolescent who takes risks by obtaining forbidden rock star posters, attending parties, wearing jewelry and jeans, and arguing politics with her teachers. Above all else, she is a spunky and lovable child who looks for freedom wherever she can obtain it and manages to triumph over her restrictive surroundings.<br /><br />The illustrations provide a simple but powerful depiction of the events in the author's life. Many of the drawings have a dream-like quality that accentuates the emotional impact of the joys, sadness, violence, and familial love that Satrapi experiences. This touching story reminds me of Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner.\\" I recommend both as excellent coming-of-age stories in tumultuous foreign settings.<br /><br />Eileen Rieback
B00005JLR8|5.0|To all of the self-important \\"critics\\" who gave this film anything less than five stars, I would simply say this:  please don't try to spoil an important, meaningful movie-going experience with your criticisms of \\"plot-devices\\" and \\"cliches.\\"  This movie (with its pitch perfect cast) tells a story that is the only story worth watching--that is, real life.  Life is at times almost unendurably painful and then it is gut-wrenchingly beautiful.  This is no \\"device,\\" it is the honest depiction of one family's struggles in their life's station.  Who cares how they got there, or whether they should have left Ireland or are watching their kids close enough?   <br />The performances of the children are scary good with the ten-year old's rendition of Desperado so sweet and sure that I must get the movie for that scene alone.  I never thought I would see children's performances that rival To Kill a Mockingbird's, but I have, and the Bolger sisters are the daughters we all should be so lucky to have.   <br />It is no coincidence that this movie was filmed in NYC a month after 9/11.   Jim Sheridan tells the story of his family as catharsis amidst death.  See this movie as an affirmation of why there is cinema in our society.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|ALL of the performances in this movie are EXCELLENT, especially Ellen Burstyn, who deservedly was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, 2000 (but somehow lost to Julia Roberts).      The movie starts off light, but gradually builds into this living nightmare, complete with SPOILER ALERT arm amputations, sexual exploits, and electroshock \\"therapy.\\"  The whole amputation thing didn't really bother me, but seeing Ellen Burstyn getting SHOCKED simply for popping diet pills like candy did.  I had NO idea that something that trivial could drive someone mad, and this madness would actually require that type of therapy, but my mother verified this information for me ... and that's because she herself went a little crazy on diet pills in her younger days.      An eye-opening movie, to say the least, but ... if you're squeamish, WATCH OUT!
B00005JLKB|5.0|As a child growing up in the 1970's I often watched the 1950's black & white version of Superman.  It seemed that the show only offered a couple minutes of \\"super\\" action and a lot of talk.  I also took in the various Superman cartoons and read a few of the comics.  However, I think the highpoint of my Superman experience was the 1978 movie.  To this day that is just about my favorite comic book to film transfer that I've seen.  Anyway I'm not a die hard fan of Superman and really didn't think much of SMALLVILLE one way or the other when I heard about it.<br /><br />Then about mid season I caught one of episodes and found I really liked it.  They have made some changes from the comic book and updated some of the characters to fit the current times.  I really like the way Lex Luther is portrayed.  He makes for an excellent morally challanged friend of Clark.  I was a bit disappointed that Lana was not a redhead but think that Kristin Kreuk does a fine job.  She and Clark, Tom Welling, have a nice chemistry.  When I found out Bo Duke...I mean John Schneider was going to play Jonathan Kent I was concerned he might not be able to shake his Bo Duke image.  I need not have worried, he did a fine job of leaving Bo Duke behind and making the role of Jonathan Kent his own.  Giving the role of Martha Kent to Annette O'Toole was a nice way to pay homage to the Superman film in which she portrayed an adult Lana Lang.  Although some people find Chloe Sullivan, Allison Mack, really annoying I really like her character.  The high school news reporter that is hot on the trail of Clark and the other Krypton generated oddities.<br /><br />During the first season of SMALLVILLE Clark is busy learning about his origins, learning how to use his powers and conceal them from his friends, and protecting the townsfolk from villans with Krypton generated powers.  These villans have received the nick name of \\"Freak of the Weak\\" villans.<br /><br />The DVD is nicely put together.  The special features are okay but improved upon in season two.  The picture transfer is crisp and offered in widescreen.  This seasons worth of DVD's is reasonably price and a real bargin for fans of the show.special features are okay but improved upon in season two.

Buy this disc for the stories they tell throughout it <br />alone.  The audio is identical to that of the original release and some of the live footage is sketchy at best.

B000002KMV|4.0|This album is a lot better than it largely gets credit for.  Prince is all over the place musically, and this album ends up working as a pretty strong, rebellious statement about liberation (both in the boundary eschewing music and the lyrics).  The title track starts things off, hitting us with a dose of hard electrofunk.  The clever lyrics are a mixture of the social and the deeply personal, with non-comformity being the constant theme.  The New Wave-ish, industrial Funk of \\"Sexuality\\" is one of my favorites on the album (here, the focus is on the themes of liberation and elevation, encouraging a new, more educated and more accepting phase in society)  \\"Do Me Baby\\" is one of the best slow songs that Prince has ever done, though I personally can do without the monologue, etc., in the last half.  The synth driven Pop/Funk of \\"Private Joy\\" is another winner.  'Ronnie, Talk to Russia' is a really wild and clever track addressing the state of relations between The U.S. and Russia (the Cold War, the fear and threat of potential nuclear holocaust----so yes, the theme here directly portends the outstanding follow up album 1999).  The air-tight Funk jam \\"Let's Work\\" is also really strong.  'Annie Christian' is a really interesting song, and one of the \\"weirdest\\" that he's ever done.  It is a spoken word, almost rap track, with a really robotic feel.  It has some of the most minimal production that I have ever heard from Prince, yet it's extremely effective (it also has some divinely perfect guitar work--it's not at all heavy, being used to pretty light effect, but it's employed with just the perfect level of economy). In this song Prince once again speaks about current events, using this Annie Christian character as a reference point.  The retro, freaked out 50's Rock track, \\"Jack U Off\\", is humorous, kinky and outrageous, and Prince contributes yet more killer, and this time much more wild and boisterous, guitar work. Prince released this album before he became a star, but it really is better than some of his later material that many people may be more familiar with (I'm talking to you \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\"), so it's well worth taking a listen.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I got to see an advance screening of this film last night, with the added benefit of a Q&A session with Kerry Conran afterwards. Personally, I loved the film, it had style, beautiful visuals, and stayed true to it's pulp comic roots. It really felt like a movie that would have been made in the 30's (if they had been able to do the special effects). There were a number of laugh out loud moments and a couple of times where the audience (Admittedly, mostly sci-fi geeks) applauded. Hopefully the movie will do well at the box office, because I'd love to see more with this technique. <br />The question and answer session with Mr Conran afterwards was also pretty neat. Apparently _every_ shot was against a blue screen, although the cockpit of the plane was real, the outside was still bluescreen. They took the view that if an object got touched, it was real, and had to be built. So in driving sequences, the steering wheel was real, but the rest of the vehicle was CGI. Also, there are three versions of this movie (two of which we will probably never see). An animated version they made first, then a live action version with stand ins, and finally the real version with the big stars. This was why he could do all the filming in a few weeks, since the whole movie had already been made twice before. <br />Someone also asked if Conran was working on anything new at the moment, and the answer was yes, Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars. <br />An amazing piece of work which will probably be the start of many movies made this way, since they could do it at a fraction of the cost it would have been if shot in the normal way.
0803723865|5.0|I saw an article about Julia Donaldson in The Guardian a couple of weeks ago and was intrigued enough to try to find a copy of the book -- thank you Amazon!  The Gruffalo arrived today and lived up to my expectations as a book worth adding to my kiddie lit collection.  The story is a simple one, told in rhyme, about a mouse who meets 3 animals and convinces each of them not to eat him because he is going to have lunch with a gruffalo and those 3 animals happen to be the gruffalo's favourite foods.  Then he meets a gruffalo and convinces the gruffalo not to eat him because he, the mouse, is the toughest animal in the woods.  And the gruffalo becomes a believer as he follows the mouse and all of the animals run away when they see the mouse? or is it the trailing gruffalo.  The pictures by Axel Scheffler are well drawn, but what makes the book special is Julia Donaldson's ability to tell the story all in rhyme.  She belongs on a shelf next to Dr. Seuss.  This book should become more widely known to American parents; it is a real winner and well deserving of the \\"Smarties Gold Book Prize award.  I see that Amazon is out of stock of both the board books and the cd's and tapes.  Get with it Amazon and stock up for the Christmas rush!
038551123X|5.0|This book grabs you from the beging and doesn't let go. It's a great escapist novel, with not much pandering towards methephor and symbolism, but still great! The only serial killer novel to grab me in a long time, the first I acctually think I would read again or read more off.
B000099T2L|5.0|I wasn't sure what her temporary departure from Destiny's Child would bring us, but am pleased to say that 8 of the 15 tracks cannot be ignored! Four songs have already reached the top tens of most music industry charts. In this day of one-hit wonders and top-of-the-chart-grabbing wannabe's, that's saying a heck of a lot. Beyonce took quite a few risks with some of the tracks to explore her individuality. Love her or hate her, Beyonce is undeniably today's \\"It\\" girl!  I would see for myself... Enjoy!
6303443214|5.0|IWTV is pretty neat for a vampire movie although there's a trillion other Dracula movies, but none like this ever before! I totally recommend this if you love {or at least enjoy} vampire movies. This movie may be 10 years old, but it's cool.It's one of those movies  you'll have to pay attention to it or you get bored. As it goes on, it gets better. I know. I'd say it's like an \\"immortality\\" movie such as Tuck Everlasting. {Totally different plot, no vampires or gore}. {F.Y.I., this film even had some nudity in it, but it doesn't interfere with the rating because there's only 1 scene of it}.
B000000XCH|5.0|The first CCR album I ever owned and I played it constantly. Today you would call it the ultimate roots rock album and it would barely chart. It opens and closes with two of the most powerful soulful rock songs ever created, \\"Ramble Tamble\\" and \\"Long As I Can See The Light\\" In between those bookends are a couple of Sun Records covers, an 11 minute Motown cover, a couple of anti-war anthems, a blues cover and a couple of top 40 songs that peaked at #2.
B00008DDHZ|3.0|I understand that the producers wanted this mockumentary to be as close to \\"the real tying\\" as possible but they might also have kept in mind that the film, as dialogue-rich as it is, loses a great deal for viewers who are not well-versed in Northern Irish dialect.  I had to watch it twice all the way through before I really grasped everything required to appreciate it.  If this had been made solely for domestic consumption in Ireland the question would not be relevant.  However, marketed as it has been for overseas consumption, one must ask at least why there were no subtitles provided.<br /><br />I also question the motives of the filmmakers in putting together a feature film that \\"fools\\" the viewer into thinking it's a documentary.  Kudos to the brilliant acting jobs by known and unknown actors alike and laud the choppy camerawork, which was right on the money.  But what was the point, really?  Why all this effort expended to make a feature that resembles a doc but isn't?  And the insertion of Tim Piggot-Smith (of \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" infamy) as the hard-ass commander is heavy-handed since this actor is routinely cast as sadistic military types and has probably never played a sympathetic role in his life.<br /><br />I personally would rather see a balanced documentary of the actual event, so that I can know for certain that what I'm seeing truly happened.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris' \\"The End Of Faith\\" is an abrupt awakening for those who watch idly as national and religious leaders, poached in the broth of religious dogma, form lines in the final battle for civilization. Harris argues that the absurdities and eccentricities of organized faith, which have provided both solace and misery in past, will, if unchecked, lead us to civilization's end.  <br /> <br />The great difficulty that a reasonable, liberal and free mind has in accepting the notion of another's faith as being simply and profoundly wrong is precisely what makes this book so challenging and important. <br /> <br />Harris carefully details the tenets of Islam, quoting from the Koran at length. One comes away from his book convinced that Bin Laden and his cohorts are intelligent souls who are, quite simply, doing the righteous work of their God, by the book. While the irrationality of Islam points us most directly towards the end of time, our present leaders in America, guided by their own faith, are shown to be simply painting by the numbers as well, quickening the pace towards the Armageddon they believe inevitable. <br /> <br />Harris is not without answers or hope. This is a joyful book, articulating his love for present existence and a deep, respectful understanding of the truly sacred oneness that all existence shares. <br /> <br />He also details the obvious. If the countless billions of dollars now being spent on absurd foreign incursions were spent instead on the application of already existing fuel cell technology rendering oil unnecessary, our \\"enemies\\" would be left wandering in the desert. <br /> <br />Harris advances a wealth of intelligent, original ideas throughout. I see no evidence for the \\"simplistic\\" dismissal in the above review by \\"Publishers Weekly.\\" Perhaps another read? This is a rich and wise piece of work, which strives for fairness and rationality. Those inclined to dismiss Harris as a young Bertrand Russell, simply restating what was said in aprevious century, miss the point entirely. The tools of destruction have changed. May I suggest they cue up their Tivos and take another look at people in flames jumping out of tall burning buildings? This is not your grandfather's Sunday afternoon philosophical musings. This is as immediate as now. <br />
B0000C1733|1.0|If you were a fan of the band, you'd own their albums and not need a record companys way of extracting more money from the fans. I like the RHCPeppers and own all their CD's. I think By The Way was pretty weak and had only a few good tracks. Californication was brilliant and one of the BEST chili Peppers CD's ever. And we should all bow down and thank John Frusciante for that. The chili peppers are all very talented musicians but I think it's johns unparelleled style that took this band from good to great. When I heard the song 'Pretty little ditty ' from Mothers Milk, I knew they had found a guitar player like no other. make your own greatest hits CD. It's not hard if you own thier albums.One Hot minute was and embarassment and should be removed from existance. This greatest hits CD is for the people that made fun of you in high school in 1987 for wearing a Chili peppers shirt because they didn't know anything about good music. And then you saw them in 1992 singing under the bridge while wearing thier new Doc martens. weak.  Go out and buy every John Frusciante solo cd ever made. Although his first two are a bit odd, he got better and better as the years went on. Get the Brown Bunny soundtrack and then get Ataxia ( Johns collaberation with the amazing Joe lally from Fugazi).
0790740443|5.0|After seeing this film on TV a few times, I decided to go out to the video store and rent it.  To me, this is one of those films that really sticks with me for a long time.  I thought that Kurt Russell's portrayal as \\"Todd\\" (a super soldier selected and trained from birth) was very compelling.  Call me weird or crazy, but there is a certain fascination I have for characters who play these lonewolf/mysterious types.  These are the types of characters who give some people a creepy feeling down the back of their neck because their screen presence is so powerful and unusual. <br /> <br />The story line is mostly biographical.  A group of babies are specially selected at birth for a special operations unit.  These kids are indoctrinated as soldiers through 17 + years of brutal training.  At various stages in the training, those who do not make the cut are simply killed.  The story focuses on Todd.  After Todd fights various campaigns we meet him again at the age of 38 when a comanding officer questions his and his platoon's abilities compared to another platoon of super soldiers.  A contest is given where Todd and a number of men from his platoon square off against the \\"new and improved\\" soldiers.  Todd along with a few of his men are left for dead and dumped on a planet designated for garbage disposal.  Todd was the only one of his kind to survive.  This planet it turns out is inhabited.  The natives cautiously welcome him and help him for a while.  Eventually, they abandon him after deciding that he simply isn't a good fit for their community.  Later however, they find out that they've made a big mistake. <br /> <br />Although Todd was raised to be a soldier only, later in the film we see that he is making somewhat of a transition to being more compassionate and emotional.   <br /> <br />
B0000028MA|4.0|This is a perfect time-capsule album to showcase both the sound of the 90's and the sound of Seattle. From Alice in Chains to Screaming Trees to Soundgarden. Two very strong songs from Pearl Jam. A couple of wonderfully catchy Paul Westerberg songs. To further the Seattle connection it includes Jimi Hendrix and Heart covering Zep's \\"Battle Of Evermore\\". Serious omission which prevents this album from reaching ***** status is NO NIRVANA! or at least The Kingsmen.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Democrats will love this because it gives them what they want to hear.<br />Not the truth, but what they want to hear.<br />Many of the so called facts in the movie have been found to be<br />made up, with no basis in fact.<br />This is really a film to study if you interested in learning how<br />to be a sleezy film editor.

The biggest market for this book is the already converted<br />Bush Haters (Morons), and people without the drive to do thier own research<br />on things, and God forbid form and indepently arrived at personal opinion.<br />How do I know listen to the left---they're still talking about the war they<br />cursed me for fighting in.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Virulently anti-Semitic, maniacally violent. I borrow from another customer reviewer these words: \\"As a civilized person, I am repulsed by this horror.\\" DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS A COINCIDENCE THAT A MAN WHOSE FATHER IS A HOLOCAUST DENIER JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE ONE TO MAKE THIS MOVIE???????!!!!!!    P.S. Taking your kids to this is tantamount to child abuse.
B000001FO4|5.0|I love this cd!!!...til it was stolen out of my car. (...)  I'ved loved their songs since forever!!  I only wish they were still around and making music like they were before.  It sucks that music today is not even music.  It's a black guy making simple words rhyme with pre-made sounds following his voice....yeah, now that's real music. (...) Bring back the hair bands America. (...)
B00003CXCT|5.0|Us old timers realize how important these movies are.  I'm sure most of us (myself included) will go out any buy these dvds and love them to death!  However, to deny us the original films is just plain wrong.  Some of the new CGI scenes are good...I don't really mind them, but I also want the films that I grew up with as a child.  Just because the times are changing, dosen't mean that the past has to as well.  If you were not there, you have very little insight to why some of us \\"old timers\\" are saying what we are saying.  Enjoy the dvds folks...
B000006NPY|5.0|Talk about being ahead of your time. Billy Corgan has always been one to move musically advanced beyond his peers, but given this album it's utterly astonishing. This is basically his album, not the Pumpkins. It's the first album James Iha their quitarist had no hand in writing. Billy wrote it and produced it with minor help from Flood. The other two pumpkins barely have any instrumental part. This is Billy alone and it shows. It was way ahead of its time, in an era before Radiohead obliterated rock mainstream. Maybe people can finally accept it years later. <br />What's so ironic is that so many criticize it for not being siamese dream, when in actuality, it basically is. It's the exact same premise as Siamese. Everyone song represents pain and anger building up until the final track when everything is let go and released into happiness. Corgan just went about it differently. This album is utter gloom and sadness. A dark veil covers it and sometimes its easy to get lost in this album. It's so beautiful. <br />The intro \\"TO Sheila\\" makes sure the listeners know where this is going. A soft beautiful piano ballad. The first single \\"Ava Adore\\" is a techno rock song that sets the dark gothic mood that encompasses the album. From there on there's pain and depression set to tripped out piano chords and a drum machine that has more bass than a rap set. It's a bit pointless to pick out individual songs since this album is so cohesive and must be listened to fully as a concept album. If I had to pick highlights though, I'd have to say \\"Daphne Descends\\" is a brilliant work especially lyrically about Corgan's wife leaving him for someone else. \\"Crestfallen\\" is probably one of the most beautiful songs ever writen, and \\"For Martha\\" about Corgan's mother, will bring you to tears. \\"Shame\\" is also a great slow ballad which I think is most likely about then outcast member Jimmy Chamberlin.  <br />As all the sadness and doubt continue on it's almost too much to take. The album is summed up by a line in \\"For Martha\\". Billy wails, \\"Long horses we are born, creatures more than torn. Mourning our way home.\\" Yeah, pretty depressing, but definitly beautiful. The album ends with \\"17\\" a seventeen second ditty that simply states that all you need is seventeen seconds to let go of your pain and realize how beautiful life is. This is without a doubt their best album, but it's just not for everybody. Many can't listen to constant depressing balads and gothic pop, and I understand that. But that doesn't mean its a bad album. Its a beautiful album about pain and suffering that is worth a listen. what this album deserves is respect, something that is way overdue.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin, the movie, redigitized has to be awesome.  Clay's fans have had a snippet of the video when they have attended his concerts of late.  I just know this video will pull everyone's heartstrings like they have pulled ours from just watching it on the tour.  To have the full video, plus the enhanced version of Aladdin, will just be simply AMAZING!!!!!  I can't think of a better gift for Christmas than this platinum version...perhaps they knew!!!  You can have this amazing story, plus an incredible soundtrack from Clay....how much better can it get?  I plan on ordering some for my grandkids...what a better investment??  Besides the fun I can foresee on my g'kids faces, this DVD will be a long time out there if you don't get it now.  love to all...Kathy
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Just got done watching disc 1 and happy to report the DVD is alot better then it's first outing on DVD.A clean up picture and a remasted 5.1 Surround.And a sh%* load of extras.Note Kevin Smith is going to do a Clerks sequel title Passion of the Clerks.And also an Animated movie based on the short lived TV show is also in the works.Check out the Viewaskew website for all the news of Kevin Smith.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have read many of the reviews of this movie, most of which are very intense, just like the film itself. After reading and hearing about nothing but the gore and violence contained throughout the picture, I was very suprised after viewing it to see nothing more than I expected from reading the Bible. The beatings, flogging, etc. are very close to what are portrayed in the gospels. In fact, the Messiah was said to have his appearnce \\"more marred than any man\\", so I actually was expecting Jesus to look even more disfigured. So enough about the over the top violence. Read the gospels. It was really that bad.  <br /> <br />Now for the DVD. I hesitated to give this review \\"5\\" stars because of my dissapointment in the DVD release of this film. The opening menu gives you the options to 1. Play the film, 2. Audio options, and 3. Chapter selection. There are no special features whatsoever on this DVD. Would it have been too much trouble to put the famous \\"Primetime\\" interview on here (I know that this interview is already available as a DVD selection, which is amazing that people would pay around $15 for a copy of a 40 minute interview). I have also seen a \\"making of\\" special on television that would have been a nice addition. Apparently the need to make more money on many different DVD's that should be special features on here was more important than putting out the best product possible.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would give the movie itself 5 stars as the most realistic portrayal of the Jesus' suffering ever put on film. However, only 3 stars for the DVD due to lack of ANY special features.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a \\"temporary\\" taxi driver for the past 12 years, just waiting for things to \\"get in to shape\\" as he tries to save enough money to start his own limo-business. He's lonely, he's afraid to commit and he has a sick mother in the hospital. Suddenly, Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters his cab and Max has no option but to drive through the LA night as Vincent, a contract-killer, starts to murder the five witnesses to a narcotics process.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" has its weakest points in the script, with some major holes that can't be overlooked, and in the development of \\"the bad guy\\", played by Tom Cruise. I mean, Vincent must be the dumbest, worst (yet luckiest) contract killer alive in the world. Not that Cruise isn't good in the movie, he is - at least he shows some effort at trying to be good in a role that is different from everything he has done until today. The movie's strongest points are the excepcional direction by Michael Mann, and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />Michael Mann wanted to do a thriller. And he did it, with a capital T. \\"Collateral\\" has some very strong moments, leaving the viewer tense for most of the time. The script doesn't have logic or continnuity problems (as could have been expected, because the plot spans only twelve hours or so of the same night), but some parts treat the viewer's intelligence with disrespect. Jamie Foxx, strong in comedies, proves to be a very resourceful and convincing actor, carrying most of the weight of the movie on his back. The final 15 or 20 minutes contain a plot-twist that is not unexpected (but not too obvious either) and provide the best moments of the movie. Jada Pinkett also rises above the expected supporting role she's supposed to play.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" is one more above-average movie by Michael Mann, one of the (few) trully innovative directors in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10
B00003CXCT|1.0|Dear Mr. Lucas, <br /> <br />Is it so difficult to put both versions out on DVD?  With both the Old AND the New editions out for YOUR fans to choose amongst, such controversies as the upcoming release of the DVD could be avoided. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />An Old fan of the OLD SERIES
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was a little shocked when she released her sophomore LP with a brand new approach and image. She's really evolving to a mature lady. Forget the teenybopper debut album! This one's a real gem. It explores Aguilera's emotional rollercoaster like love and family. <br /> <br />You might be deceived by listening to the 1st single 'Dirrty'. That song is the most out of place song in the album. The rest of the songs are totally different in style. She blend contemporary pop and R&B really well. And the voice - amazing. She really shine in the ballads which showcase her vocal gymnastics. The stunner tracks include 'Can't Hold Us Down', 'Walk Away', 'Infatuation' (my favorite. Very latin-influenced), the Alicia Keys produced 'Impossible', Linda Perry penned 'Beautiful' and 'The Voice Within' (by Glen Ballard).  <br /> <br />The interludes aren't fillers. It gives some sort of intermission between songs. Its very inspiring and uplifting when you listen to this album cuz it has a wonderful meaning in the songs. If you are insecure about something, I suggest you listen to 'Beautiful'. It'll make you feel better about yourself.  <br /> <br />The not-so-good tracks like 'Underappreciated', 'Make Over' and 'Get Mine Get Yours' are just ok. 'Loving Me 4 Me' sounds like Mariah Carey. The major producer in this album is Scott Storch. He produced most of the songs here. This album clocks up to 77 mins. Very worth it.
0778320448|5.0|I have read almost every book that Debbie Macomber ever wrote, and this book is excellent! I started reading it at 6pm when my husband left for work, and I finished reading it at 11pm, when I finally crawled into bed. I COULD NOT put the book down until I finished it! There are so many characters in this book that could be given stories of their own, so I am hoping just maybe Debbie will consider a sequel.
B000002H33|5.0|Very few albums, carry the power and brutality that Master Of Puppets carries. The album starts off like RTL with an acoustic guitar (Battery) and then the electrics start the THUNDER; it follows up with the most well known Metallica live tune \\"Master of Puppets\\" which contains a combination of awesome riffs and some beautiful harmonies; the gothic based \\"Thing That Should Not Be\\" shows off James ROARING like a madman and an incredible guitar riff; the traditional #4 Ballad \\"Sanitarium\\" has got the best lyrics ever written by anyone ,plus a very haunting rhythm guitar. <br />\\"Disposable Heroes\\" another Trasher on which the band showcases the horrors of WAR , fantastic chorus; \\"Lepper Messiah\\" is a slower song (at least half of it) with some hard hitting riffs; \\"ORION\\" stands out as the best instrumental song from MetallicA, fabulous pace changes, and great BASS Solo near the end (R.I.P. Cliff).  <br />Last but not least my personal favorite and one song that definately describes the 80's MET, \\"DAMAGE Inc.\\" fast as hell and you gotta love when James Screams \\"GO!\\" and then Kirk makes out and impressive solo. <br /> <br />Song Rates: <br />Battery 9/10 <br />Master of Puppets 11/10 <br />The Thing That Should Not Be 8/10 <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 9/10 <br />Disposable Heroes 9/10 <br />Lepper Messiah 9/10 <br />ORION 10/10 <br />Damage Inc. 12/10
0553277472|1.0|That review by \\"Woodchuck\\" helped clarify what I wanted to say. <br /> <br />I read it years ago, and \\"knew\\" that the author was unbalanced, but also that he held an enormous attraction to many, many people.  I couldn't reconcile the two. <br /> <br />I've never known anyone who was schizophrenic, but Pirsig's belief system echoes exactly what the reviewer was saying; something I would have catagorized as \\"grandiosity,\\" with no small amount of paranoia thrown into the mix.   <br /> <br />In any case -- should you decide to pursue this book -- know that the text is rambling and simplistic.   <br /> <br />I've read many of the reviews, and those people who were lost or somewhat depressed (or even mentally disturbed -- I'm not quite sure) seem to really enjoy the book. Those people who are basically happy with their lives and mentally \\"sound\\" are dismayed and (somewhat) disgusted with the book.   <br /> <br />I'm not disgusted with the book, but with people who recommend it blindly to others.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's nothing this humble fan could say that hasn't been said by other reviewers, and said better.  I loved the entire DVD set.  I couldn't stop watching and never watched an episode I didn't like.  I always came away smiling and engaged by the characters. <br />Hurray!  Huzzah!  Can't wait for more... if there is more. <br />LOVED FIREFLY!  LOVED BUFFY!  Moderately appreciated ANGEL.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|It's a cliche to use the term \\"overproduced\\" in critiquing music, but that's the word that consistently comes to mind with many of the songs on \\"Genius Loves Company\\".  To me, much of Ray Charles' catalog suffers from this- too many syrupy strings, horns and background singers.  I don't have a problem with orchestrations- they work to great effect on old Capitol-era Sinatra records and the Ella Fitzgerald \\"Songbook\\" series- but they walk a fine line between sounding lush and overwrought.  Sadly, many of the songs on this, Mr. Charles' final studio album, fall into the latter  category.  His voice and piano/keyboard playing are powerful enough by themselves, and don't need to be overshadowed by such sappy sounds that instantly make this brand new album sound terribly dated.  That's been a complaint of mine about most of what I've ever heard from Ray Charles, and I'm disappointed that this CD is no exception.    To be fair, there are some true gems on this album.  While some of the arrangments might overpower and reduce the timelessness of the music, most of the duet partners seem to complement Mr. Charles quite nicely.  Standout tracks are those with Norah Jones, Diana Krall, BB King, Gladys Knight and Van Morrison.  They have just the right mix of jazz, soul and blues to give them a touch of the class and elegance of which Ray is so deserving.  Elton John isn't bad, but his singing has become so over the top in the past decade or so as to become almost self-parodying.  And there are many songs in Elton's catalog that would have better suited the pair.  Willie Nelson is actually beginning to sound old.  That by itself isn't a bad thing, but the attempt to replicate the orchestrations on the Sinatra version of \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\" just sound terrible.  The Michael McDonald track is just excruciating, and epitomizes the overproduced sound that I'm talking about, with the muted trumpets and synths.  So while there are certainly good songs here, only half the songson a 12 song CD being listenable makes this a collection of questionable value.  Sure, it's Ray Chalres, which for completists will be enough.  But for more casual fans, well...listen to some samples first to see what you think.        What I would like to hear is a collection of Ray Charles on soulful vocals and piano, with minimal backing.   If anyone is aware of such a CD, please click on my profile and e-mail me.  I've often had the Atlantic recordings recommended to me; they do sound good but don't have Ray at the peak of his vocal abilities.  While I should have known what to expect on a duets collaboration, I was hoping that this CD would have a more consistent, timeless sound.  Sadly, it doesn't deliver.  Even more sadly, unless there are hidden gems lurking in the vaults, this is the last original recording we're ever going to have from Ray Charles.    (And for people who take some of these reviews so seriously- LIGHTEN UP!  The ones comparing Ray Charles unfavorably to Avril Lavigne, Vanilla Ice and the Backstreet Boyz are obviously written sarcastically or cynically.  There seem to be regular Amazon reviewers who post such absurd, cynical reviews.  Some of them are actually funny, some not.  But if a review sounds too over the top to be real, chances are it's a joke.  And if they're serious, well, are they really worth your time?)
B00000AFWW|5.0|I have thousands of CDs and I keep coming back to this CD as one of my very favorites. <br /> <br />When I first heard this CD, now about six years ago, I was disappointed. A couple of songs stood out, but, at the time, I didn't enjoy over half of the songs. I was expecting a grunge rock experience, more like \\"Live Through This\\". <br /> <br />Celebrity Skin is impeccably produced and has a fluid, soothing sound while retaining fantastic electric guitar. <br /> <br />Now I easily prefer this CD over \\"Live Through This\\", and I find almost every song to be very good, if not great. <br /> <br />Courtney Love's voice is amazing on this CD. I put her just behind Sinead as far as my favorite vocalists go. <br /> <br />The sad thing about this CD is it got rather horrible reviews from critics, who, as usual, are idiots; and who knows how Courtney Love, Hole, and Billy Corgan's life would have been different had Celebrity Skin been appreciated as the all-time great that it is.
B000002KGT|4.0|I have been a little shocked to see the number of reviewers that dislike this album. \\"Rumours\\" (British spelling) and its predecessor \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" were the two best albums of the group's many incarnations, followed in quality by \\"Bare Trees\\" and \\"Tusk.\\" I agree with one reviewer about the dullness of this album's fourth track \\"Don't Stop.\\" Furthermore, Rumours clearly falls short of the bar set by \\"Fleetwood Mac.\\" Nevertheless, I suspect the few negative views of this album may stem from the group's \\"pop\\" sound. F-Mac was never a metal band, or a hard rock group. They started in the British blues tradition (talk about a sub genre) in the 1960s and went through two lineup shifts prior to emerging in the mid-late 1970s with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joining Mick Fleetwood plus Christine and John McVie. This team's songs remain some of the best examples of what pop can be, when it's made by musicians and not produced by made-for-TV toy boys.    \\"Second Hand News,\\" \\"The Chain,\\" \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" are terrific songs. Furthermore, there isn't a major miss step on the album, although \\"Don't Stop\\" comes close. \\"You Make Loving Fun,\\" sounds simple at first, but the words relay so much excitement.    The interesting thing about Fleetwood Mac as a group surely has been their longevity, and the musical changes they went through. Just compare this album to the Danny Kirwan/Bob Welch/Christie McVie dominated Bare Trees and you will find something wonderful. A group that went through massive personnel shifts (again), and yet retained a certain style that enables the listener to recognize common elements in the albums. The group never was able to top \\"Fleetwood Mac,\\" but that's hardly a bad review!
B00005JNEI|4.0|You can love something and still criticize it, want it to be better or to see something differently.  If we cant allow this voice (and its actually pretty mainstream), then we are becoming what we claim we our fighting.  Hail a patriot.  Its scary to see the possible reasons we got into Iraq, and just how much hate exists in some people of all cultures. <br />

I would almoust be inclinde to give them a good review because it was very amusing to whach. The digitule efects were amazingly good but the plot was not the best and it was soooooooooooo cheasy!! One scen my friend looks over at me and says a line then the guy says it I mean come on.If there is nothing els out and I hadn't seen it I probebly would see it but only with a laid back funnie group of people.
0060922583|4.0|First - this book brings together some astounding ideas already put forth many years ago.  It is not altogether \\"new\\" but some of the claims and suggestions the author makes are fairly mind-boggling.<br /><br />It will make you ponder deeply your own human mind.  I always have enjoyed a book that made me think as objectively as possible about primitive animal behavior, modern civilization, and the structure of our reality (physics).  All of these elements are explored, combined and presented well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  Not the topic of light discussion...
0452284392|5.0|Barabasi's \\"Linked\\" is an excellent introducton into the theory underlying social networks...with enough detail to give the more intent reader a clear and thoughtful view of the discipline. As a marketing strategist often called on to answer the question \\"How do we reach customers in age of TiVo, pop-up blockers and SPAM filters?\\" I found Barabasi provided a really solid treatment about the mechanics of social networks and their practical application, e.g., word-of-mouth marketing as a consumer-driven versus advertiser-driven channel. Perhaps not for the casual reader, though to be sure there is no reason why anyone choosing to apply him/herself to this book can't take away some truly valuable insights. \\"Linked\\" is a \\"must read\\" for marketers and advertisers as well as brand/product managers.

B00003CXCT|3.0|Debating the changes seems pointless now, as George has made even more changes for this release, and the possibility of seeing the films on DVD as we saw them in 1977 is pretty much never going to happen.  It's a shame, and a contradiction from a man who claims to want to preserve classic movies, but there it is. <br /> <br />What's probably the worst part is that by wanting to \\"fix\\" the movies, he's basically detracting from all the hard work done by the puppeteers and FX guys, who were doing cutting edge stuff for 1977-1983.  Also, it takes away from Irvin Kershner & Richard Marquand's directorial efforts.  When you insert whole scenes and change snippets of dialogue, it changes the pacing of the movie, which the original directors intended.  George apparently just wanted to re-direct them.  Such a shame. <br /> <br />Oh, well.  I'm buying them anyway, since they'll probably be the only DVDs of the thing we'll see.  I guess I'll have to be satisfied with classic trilogy bootlegs. . . <br /> <br />*Ithorian is suddenly seized by several men in white armor and dragged away. . .*
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium is a great flick to pick up if you want to just kick back and watch a pseudo mindless action film.  Obviously, if you delve too deeply into trying to examine all the various nuances of the characters, plot, or action (ex. How come all the rebels die like flies in the beginning when they were supposedly some fairly well outfitted resistence cells?  After a torch is taken to the Mona Lisa [which is also a few square feet too large in comparison to the real deal] the painting sits as if nothing is burning?  How is it that the gun kata were to make any semblence of sense [being as a normally trained gun-wielding individual would probably not be trying to shoot at random vectors, but rather DIRECTLY AT a target]?)  <br />And the questions go on and on ... <br /> <br />However, none of this really matters if you just sit back and relax, and take it as the mind-numbing action flick that it is. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00006G8K0|4.0|Without wishing to take away from the original Dracula movie starring Bela Lugosi, or the more recent Bram Stoker's Dracula adaptation, this for me is THE definitve Dracula movie. Christopher Lee's portrayal of the count is both graceful, suave, intimidating and menacing, and is only offset by Peter Cushing's masterful Van Helsing, playing his nemesis. This is the movie that brought the fairly unknown Hammer studios to a World audience, and more than set the tone, and standard, of horror movies from the 60's onward. Released in the US as the Horror of Dracula (to avoid confusion with the 1931 Lugosi classic), it's links to the Stoker novel are actually tenuous at best, and the story is pretty weak really. That said, the set design, supporting cast, and all round production are excellent, underlined with a stirring macabre musical score. At just over 80 mins, it moves very quickly, and I'm sure most modern audiences will find it remarkablt tame, but it captures the mood and feel of the genre completely. I remember watching an interview with Christopher Lee (most recently seen as Saruman in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he spoke with great affection about the role of Dracula (a role he reprised in several sequels). The main reason for this was delivering the horror story in it's purest fantastical and mythical form. No matter how scared the audience became, they took comfort from the fantasy of it all. I for one would much rather see this kind of graceful suspense than watch a maniac serial killer hacking up innocent victims, I see enough of that on the news!. Great movie classic, and MUST SEE for any true horror fans. Enjoy!
B00006BTCA|5.0|On the surface Interpol come from the same ilk as bands such as The Strokes and Franz Ferdinand, but where those bands were fun for about 3 days tops, Interpol shows much greater depth and lasting appeal. Interpol's sound is dark but vibrant. The vocals are very reminiscent of JD in places, but the music is more upbeat. The layers of fragmented guitar and deep juicy bass lines make Turn on the Bright Lights more than just a bunch of dancible pop tunes.
B000006TRV|1.0|Before I go into too much detail about why this is such a terrible album, I should mention that I have nothing against Pink Floyd's other albums.  In fact, I'd already heard three of their albums before this one, and they were all innovative, epic pieces of work.  However, it seems that whenever an artist does anything truly innovative, they reach a point where they become so self-indulgent in their own ambition that packaging and granduer become more important than the music itself.  At the same time, fans and critics desperate to retain their \\"artistic\\" image fall for it and lose sight of the fact that the music is dull, and lacks any substance.  Another classic example is Rick Wakeman's \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth.\\" <br /> <br />Even at the beginning of the album, you can see some of the band's originality slipping away.  \\"In the Flesh?\\" has sort of an arena rock feel, and its predictability is a considerable let down after the powerful opening.  \\"The Thin Ice\\" is based on the classic 50's rock 3/4 progression, and hardly even develops into a full song.   <br /> <br />  At \\"The Happiest Days of our Lives\\" the album almost begins to take shape, but when the vocals come in, the song goes to hell.  There is practically no melody, and when there is, the constant whining that is supposed to be singing actually prevents you from discerning individual notes.  And that is the sound they have chosen for the entire album. The sound effects don't help either. This is not progressive rock!  This is art rock trying to cash in on the disco craze! <br /> <br />\\"Mother\\" is another generic pop song, not nearly as special as people think. This is about where it occured to me that all the \\"classics\\" on this album are actually the only ones that are developed enough to even be called a song.   <br /> <br />About half of both of the next two tracks are made of sound effects and something resembling dialouge, so \\"Young Lust\\" is a welcome break... developed themes, decent singing, no sound effects drawing out the length of the song... but you can rest assured that won't continue. \\"One of My Turns,\\" appears to be some attempt at acting, and while the idea is conveyed, once again it is too taxing to the music to be worth it. Honestly Waters, there's frantic and there's just plain whiny.  <br /> <br />\\"Hey You\\" is the best song on the album.  For once, the cold, sad feel actually works to their advantage. If it weren't for this song, I probably would've never finished the album. <br />The next few songs are as predictable as the rest of the album, and then there's \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  This history-making song has almost no singing, but has a lot of speaking with too much inflection. Think along the lines of Rex Harrison from \\"My Fair Lady.\\"  Fortunately for him, \\"My Fair Lady\\" had a plot.  The other half is a sort of \\"new age\\" ballad.  From here on, the album suddenly turns 80's on us... \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" had a definite new wave vibe to them.  Here, you are forced to ask yourself, as pleasant as this is compared to the rest of these \\"songs,\\" is there anything special about new wave? <br /> <br />\\"The Trial\\" is worthy of special mention.  This song is just plain funny... The 30 seconds that this website allows you should be enough to let you know just how much of a pathetic attempt at drama this is. I'd like to quote a passage from this song, and I am not making this up: <br />Judge: \\"the way you made suffer your exquisite wife and mother fills me with the urge to defecate!\\" <br />Crowd: \\"No judge, don't!\\" <br />Oh, by the way, if you look in the sleeve, you find out that the judge is actually a giant ass with a wig on.  Artistic, no? <br /> <br />2 discs later, we are left with a load of several boring pop songs, undeveloped fragments of songs that could potentially be interesting, and sound effects and whiny vocals that are supposed to illustrate this man's \\"tragic\\" life. <br /> <br />All in all, it's just anotherpiece of crap masquerading as art. <br />This album sucks. <br />
068987474X|5.0|If you like Sex in the City, you will like this book. It is open, funny, honest and puts it all out there - no fluff!  It is a wake up call for every female that is riding the dating rollercoaster.  It gives an insightful male and female perspective on relationships and points out a lot of the classic mistakes (and excuses) women make in dating.  Ultimately I found the book funny and empowering. A quick read that you will pass on to friends and enjoy realizing and sharing your dating faux pas together.
0393035158|5.0|Though the author occasionally lets his enthusiasm get the better of him, this is a brave and stimulating first effort that's highly recommended for both secular liberals and religious conservatives.     I don't know whether god exists, but I do know mankind will cease to exist if we do not clearly apprehend the islamists' challenge for what it is. Sam Harris's provocative (in the best sense of the word) and penetrating argument, despite its excesses, provides a necessary corrective to two of the sappier ideas of our time.    First, Harris makes short shrift of left-liberals' refusal to recognize that there is nothing \\"progressive\\" about a thoroughly pious and uniquely muslim movement that calls holy the deliberate mass slaughter of children. This is an apocalyptic religious movement, not a territorial or political one. The IRA and ETA never slaughtered hundreds of children in a schoolhouse. Islam's holy warriors represent represent a uniquely monstrous threat to our very civilization. They will as gladly slaughter left-wing atheists as right-wing Christians.      Second, Harris reminds Americans that religious beliefs are not on a par with scientific ones and must never be allowed to intrude on the scientific school curriculum. Our national habit of asking our leaders to make ritual displays of religiosity will not make us the slightest bit safer against the jihadists; it's more likely to lull us into complacency, as with the mindless mantra that \\"islam is a religion of peace.\\" This is of course a falsehood as regards those millions of jihadists and jihadist sympathizers who have told us again and again, in Breslan, Bali, Moscow, Madrid, Tel Aviv and New York, that they love violent death more than we love life.    Whether you believe in Jesus or Marx or none of the above, you owe it to yourself and to our society to read this powerful book. No one is likely to follow his call for world government-- that idea represents the triumph, shall we say, of faith over experience-- but Sam Harris has nonetheless done the nation a great service. Hear the man out.
B00005A0V0|5.0|but the extra tracks more than make up for it. That's all, this is a cool album, read other reviews for more, I can't be bothered to write a proper review, go ahead, give me a bad review thingy...
B0001UL7RY|4.0|All in all, I did like this CD, though I felt that her first attempt was somewhat better, with catchier beats, and more upbeat songs. Some songs seemed to sound the same and were kinda deppressing, but more often then not I ended up liking them. Here is my list of what songs you really should give a chance: <br />1.Fall To Pieces <br />So good, great melody and touching lyrics. <br /> <br />2.Nobody's Home <br />Good, but I HATE the chorus, it sounds so much like that Evenescence song that I can't stand. <br /> <br />3.Freak Out  <br />Cute song, HATE the techno begning,  I agree with other reviews that it seems a little immature to be on this \\"deep\\" Cd . Still it is very catchy and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />4.Don't Tell Me <br />Okay, this song does get a little annoying after hearing it a MILLION times, still I like it for it's awesome message. <br /> <br />5. Who Knows <br />Very good, upbeat song. I don't like the chorus much though. <br /> <br />Give this CD a chance, if you hate it give it too some teenage girl you know going through a diffucult break-up!
B000002U82|5.0|This is a good album for meditative pursuits.  It is good to listen to alone or also to share with friends.  The dreamy music and the profound lyrics make this album required listening.<br /><br />  Many segments of beautiful instrumentals and song, this is just wonderful sound.  Pleasure for the ear.  This album can really put you over the edge of reality, and for this reason, it is good for meditative purposes, and to de-stress and ponder the big questions of life.<br /><br />  The lyrics do address these big questions of life, like how to find your way in the world, and what false beliefs we often fall for.  The secret, according to Floyd, is to maintain a sense of the spiritual beauty in life, death, and the universe.
B0002I831S|3.0|I remember in the early 70's through about the early 90's, Star Trek reruns ran in syndication as horribly muddy-colored prints.  Then, all of a sudden, we started seeing these beautiful shining pristine prints, like they were filmed yesterday.  I'll never forget the stunning contrast when this \\"switch over \\" occurred. All I can say is what happened to those beautiful prints?  They're not on the Star Trek DVDs.  Did -they- get faded already?  Digital technology alone does not make a great DVD.  Lets spend some money on print quality Paramount!
068987474X|5.0|Or when I was 20, or 26, or 30.  Like the other reviewers, I give this a whole-hearted thumbs-up. I wasn't even looking for this kind of book when I bought it, I just really like Greg Behrendt as a comedian. But BOY does this book make you sit there and think \\"Ah, yes, that's true....I remember when I learned that....ooh yes, that was a painful realization....etc.\\"  And it's *not* male bashing at all, it's just a guy's honest perspective on why he's not calling, committing, showing up, etc.  <br /> <br />It's a very quick, funny, (brutally honest) read - I read it in one sitting.  And even at the ripe old age of 30-mumble-mumble-something, there were parts that I read uncomfortably and maybe 2 or 3 times over.  Because we all have that moment of \\"But this situation is *different* becuase it's me.\\" Right?   <br /> <br />Don't be that girl. <br /> <br />Spend the 20 bucks - it'll save you a lot of time (and confusion and moping around over some guy that's not worth your time or your pretty, as Greg says).
B00005JNEI|1.0|Democrats would serve themselves well to NOT associate with this movie. If you want to create a case against Bush, you don't want it to be based on deceptions and lies. While the movie does a good job making Bush look bad, almost all footage of him is taken COMPLETELY out of context. The footage is then manipulated in ways that totally change its original meaning. There's no way I could start on specifics here, but the following link is a good summary of the many deciets in Fahrenheit 9/11. Everyone reading this should check this link out before taking the movie at face value. Because what you're getting at face value isn't the truth.
B00003BDXG|4.0|NBK is one of the most violent movies of the last ten years. Shocking violence that is because the style of killing going on looks a lot like the Columbine massacre or other school killings. <br /> <br />In my view the movie is most of all against American televistion and how they glorify violence in all its aspects. The short fragments of real tv footage in the end definitely seems to suggest just that.  <br />Stone and Tarantine have often used violence in their movies but most of the times to show what it does in society. Of course it's over the top but it makes a very good point, this is what America and the world might be in a few years. <br /> <br />The acting is of course great with this excellent cast. Best role is Robert Downey playing an Australian 'Geraldo' type making the violence into an American newsstory with high ratings and the only thing he does is wanting does rating, he even starts killing himself to see that it is like; and he likes it. <br /> <br />There seem to have been a lot of different cameras used which will not lead to easy viewing pleasure, but it's all part of the overall plan.  <br /> <br />Great!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|You really take your life in your hands every time you sit down with a Chevy Chase film. Let's face reality here: Chevy Chase is responsible for several of the worst movies ever made. Does it take more than a few minutes of viewing to see the mind numbing folly of \\"Nothing But Trouble,\\" \\"The Three Amigos,\\" and \\"Spies Like Us\\"? Chase has sure had his truly embarrassing moments on the big screen. What redeems the guy, at least in my eyes, are several films that play up to the comedian's smart alecky, deadpan delivery. \\"Fletch,\\" of course, is the gold standard of Chevy Chase films, but other movies showcase his talents just as well. I always thought \\"Deal of the Century\\" a classic Chase film, as well as \\"Foul Play\\" (although the latter was more of an ensemble picture). But we need look no further than the four National Lampoon Vacation films to truly judge the merits of this comedian turned actor. Actually, I should say three Vacation films since the second installment, where the Griswold family went on a tour of Europe, ranks as one of the most dreadful stories ever put on film. Of the three successful entries, \\"Christmas Vacation\\" is the best, perhaps even eclipsing the first movie that started it all.<br /><br />You won't hear the familiar strains of Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Holiday Road\\" in \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" and there are no corpses strapped to the top of a station wagon either. Instead, the film invites us into the Griswold home for an old fashioned Christmas celebration the likes of which soon reach catastrophic levels. Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) Griswold, along with their disinterested kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Russ (Johnny Galecki), invite the whole family over for a season filled with happiness. Clark's parents Clark Sr. (John Randolph) and Nora (Diane Ladd) show up, as does Ellen's folks Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts). And yes, even Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) makes an appearance to save the day. Of course, along with the family comes the inevitable frustrations and stresses everyone who has ever dealt with a reunion dreads. Clark Griswold refuses, at least initially, to fall into a morass of cynicism and despair amidst the bickering and insults. His invention of a new milk preservative has our hero hoping his Christmas bonus will be extra big this year, big enough so he can install an in ground swimming pool in the backyard. Unfortunately, his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) is a scrooge with plans to make the company more fiscally conservative.<br /><br />While he waits for the check to arrive at the house, Clark embarks on several hilarious projects that haul in the belly laughs. His attempts to cover every square inch of his house with Christmas lights is a chore requiring several falls off a ladder, pointed verbal repartees with his snotty neighbors Margo and Todd Chester (Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest), and repeated failures to get the strands to light up. The acquisition and installment of the Griswold family Christmas tree is another chore handled in Clark's inimitable style. Imagine the pine they string up in Rockefeller Square every year, subtract roughly five feet from its height, and you have the tree Clark insists on setting up in the house. This thing is so huge that the branches knock out the windows when Griswold cuts the rope holding the branches together. No Yuletide season, however, would be complete without a trip to the slopes for a sledding excursion, an event filled with disastrous implications when Griswold comes up with the bright idea to cover the bottom of his sled with a Teflon based substance. My favorite scenario involves Clark trapped in his attic for a few hours. He spends his time dressed up in women's clothing (to stay warm) watching old home movies of his childhood. His abrupt fall through the trap door had me laughing for hours afterwards.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Christmas Vacation\\" gels fantastically, far better than anycast in the other three films. Kudos as always go to Randy Quaid as the squirrelly moocher Eddie; a film in this series just wouldn't be the same without this character driving Clark to fits of distraction. Beverly D'Angelo is one of those actresses who get hotter and hotter with age. The linchpin of the film is, as always, Chevy Chase as the disaster prone Clark Griswold. This is a role tailor made for his brand of clumsy, caustic humor. I don't know about you, but Chase's depiction reminds me in many ways of my own father--he won't listen to the advice of anyone else, his ideas are the best ideas, he tosses safety to the wind when working on dangerous projects, etc. But like my Dad--and probably countless other fathers--Clark is sincere and wants his loved ones to have wonderful family memories. The film works so well, I suspect, because most of us instantly recognize his character traits in our own beloved family patriarchs. Especially when Clark can't stand the pressure anymore and launches into one of his over the top tirades, again a trademark of our own fed up fathers.<br /><br />Although the DVD carries the \\"Special Edition\\" tag, the extras are surprisingly sparse. A trailer and a commentary constitute the sum total of goodies available on the disc. Moreover, the commentary doesn't include Chevy Chase. At least you hear Randy Quaid, Beverly D'Angelo, Johnny Galecki, Miriam Flynn (Eddie's wife Catherine), director Jeremiah Chechik, and producer Marty Simmons, but why no Clark W. Griswold? Perhaps he wanted too much money. His absence is unfortunate and mars what is otherwise a great commentary track. I don't even wait until Christmas to watch this movie; it's fun works year round.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Most people who write the reviews of this movie that are negative have never watched it, they are Republican \\"Die hards\\" and have their mind made up, anything that is against the Republican credo of \\"make the rich richer and to heck with everyone else\\".  They want to complain about the author, but want his autograph when he shows up at the Republican National Convention.  They are narrow minded people who do not care about anyone but the rich.  They will be out of office in January 2005, good riddance.
0393307050|5.0|Master & Commander, the first in Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin series, on which the movie loosley based, is an excellenet book. It is, however, not the easiest reading and not the kind most people will breeze through. In order to maintain authenticity, O'Brien tried to follow the actual speech of the day, which means that he uses a lot of vocabulary not used in modern English. Add in all the nautical terms, and it can be daunting, even for a well-read person (O'Brien tries to alleviate this problem partially by having a nautically-ignorant doctor ask a series of questions the answers to which explain some of the terms relating to parts of the ship). <br /> <br />The popularity of these books is due to O'Brien's rare talent for writing the way he does. When you read through narratives discussing the thoughts, actions or conversations of the main characters, you really feel you are there with them, on the ship (or wherever), in their early 19th century. And because there are relatively few fiction works dealing with the subject matter, O'Brien's writing is quite singular. <br /> <br />So this is not an easy read, but I suggest you try it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|The Horror of Dracula was Hammer Film's first Dracula film.  It follows the novel by Bram Stoker loosely with several varations from Stoker's novel.    <br />    First, there is the ever present confusion of Lucy and Mina.  In the HOD Lucy is Jonathan Harker's fiancee and Arthur Holmwood's sister,  while Mina is Arthur's wife.  In the novel it is Mina and Jonathan who are engaged while Arthur is courting Lucy who dies by Dracula's bite. <br />    Second, in the HOD Jonathan Harker is turned into a vampire by Dracula in his travels to Dracula's castle to destroy Dracula. <br />    Also the main events in the book occur in London, while in the HOD they occur somewhere on the European contenent. <br />    All in all it is a classic movie, even though it doesn't follow the novel. Even the 1931 Bela Lugosi Dracula did not follow the novel but was based more on the stage version. Actually the only movie to closely follow the novel was 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  <br />    Hammer Dracula films slowly started to go downhill after the Horror of Dracula, I think because of the screenwriters running out of ideas of how to resurect and destroy Dracula a different way each film.
B00003CXCT|3.0|These are wonderful movies, even though these dvds don't include the same versions that captivated and enchanted generations of loyal fans with their simple storytelling majesty.    Picture and sound quality are absolutely magnificent.  This is the cleanest the movies have ever looked.  Watching my old tapes and laserdiscs is like watching the movies through a layer of fog.  For the most part the digital revisions are neat.  Some are controversial, but after watching the movies a few times the new material is much less jarring.    It's ironic that George Lucas, a preservation advocate, chose not to preserve the original Oscar-winning cuts....but perhaps he has a surprise for us in the future?    If you're a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, run out and buy these dvds!

B00005JMXX|2.0|OK...First of all, I know that this hasn't been released yet...so if you are shopping around here for pre-release....for the love of all that's good don't buy 'Day After Tomorrow.'  It's a film that was decidedly rushed into theaters (REALLY shows in some of the special effects that fall flat), relied more on special effects than story, and really wastes talent of otherwise good actors. <br /> <br />First of all, let me tell you...if you thought Titanic was good when it was in theaters...then rented it and scratched your head going 'Wha?'...I can almost guarantee the same effect with 'DAT'.  It relies so much on special effects that, once that 'wow' is taken out (which the smaller screens inevitably do to heavily Special-effects flicks), you are left with story.  If that falls flat (and BOY does this one!), you have a DVD that will collect dust because you will never watch it, until you can resell it at a heavily discounted price than from what you bought it!   <br /> <br />In a nutshell...here's the story:  Global warming has wreaked havoc, and an ice age decends on the northern hemisphere...oh..in about 3 days!  What normally took decades/centuries to happen...the script writers would have us believe happens in a few short days.  Giant hail, inexplicable snowstorms in India, tornados in LA (One of the really cool effects...which lasts about a minute)...everything is going haywire, meteorogically, and we have our empassioned scientist, played by Dennis Quaid, who warned this would happen.  Oh...and for some reason, he decides to don snowshoes and walk to save his son who is stranded in NY:  He's in Philadelphia!!!  This walk presumably takes place over a few hour period.  (I'm NOT kidding).  Jake Gylennhal muddles through his performance with as much enthusiasm as warm milk.  It's like he signed on, THEN got the script...or realized how dreadfully the CGI wolves would look. (trust me...they are Ed Woodian in terms of how poorly this effect is executed!) <br /> <br/>Bad Story....scant special effects that are doomed to fail on the smaller screens of home theater.  Please...save yourselves and click over to Spiderman 2, a Far superior movie and one with the story to overcome small screen from big screen translation.  There is absolutely NOTHING to see about Day After Tomorrow!
B000092Q4U|5.0|Simply amazing. Randy has got his signature growl on this album, which is kick ass. As the Palaces Burn is tied with Devildriver and Vital Remains for Album of the Year (for me). This album went in a heavier direction than New American Gospel, making it better. As I have said before, see these guys live. I saw them at Ozzfest this summer and they were brutal as f***. Best songs are Ruin, Purified, 11th Hour, For Your Malice and A Devil in God's Country. If you don't already own this.... what the hell is wrong with you?! These guys, along with Slipknot, Devildriver and Meshuggah, are the future of metal. Buy this album!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is one of the most inventive films we've seen in a long time.  The story itself isn't particularly ingenious (cut and dried...it's a tale of revenge), and there's nothing earth shattering in the stories contruction.  Tarantino has, inexplicably, created a truly great work by paying 'homage' to his influences. <br /> <br />Kill Bill is, at heart, nothing more than a tale of revenge.  The Bride (Uma Thurman, in a career-best performance), seeks to kill those who left her for dead during her wedding rehearsal, where the other members of her wedding party were killed.  She knows who the perpetrators are:  Her old Boss, Bill, and the team of assassins he lead.  The story is simply the Bride settling her business with those who left her for dead. <br /> <br />But, Tarantino has managed to somehow weave together Kung Fu Movies, exploitation flicks, and Anime into a truly engaging work that managed to humanize very inhumane people.  He manages to eek surprisingly nuanced performances that don't shy away from hiding the characters flaws.  Lucy Liu, as the former assassin turned Japanese Crime Boss, gives a truly bone-chilling performance, as she personfies Asian sweetness with the steel heart of a killer.  (I won't be question her heritage anytime soon, I can tell you that!) <br /> <br />The film IS violent...but the blood and gore you've heard so much about is very cartoonish to the point of not having much realism to it.  Tarantino wisely handles the most gruesome scenes (The tale of Oren is handled brilliantlly when her tortured past is done through Anime...giving a potentially repugnant scene the right amount of distance so as not to be horrified) with standard 70's flick-tricks. (The fight scenes at the restaurant are done wisely in black and white, so the overwhelming Red isn't overpowering and doesn't detract from the tale)  The voilence is heavy...but handled in such a way as to not feel as overburdened as one might expect. <br /> <br />However, violence aside, this is a fantastic film.  It sets up a world where Revenge is honor.  Where fights are dances between wills.  Where martial arts can blend nicely with spaghetti westerns and 70's exploitation flicks and pay homage while creating their own new genre.  It's a fun flick that sets up for the story laid out more fully in Kill Bill 2. (which is a necessary companion to KB2 only in that if you really want to see the world that has shaped these characters, one needs to have this version)  Yes, I said Fun.  It's a charged up action packed full on MOVIE, and it paves the way nicely for the masterpiece that is KB2.   <br /> <br />My only reservation in recommending this is that you KNOW Mirimax will release both films and provide more extras in the merged versions, and THAT would be a great one to own.  However, this is such a good film and so very inventive that I can comfortably recommend it to tide you over until the full version comes out.
B0002S94OS|5.0|In my opinion musically and lyrically better than New American Gospel, but not as good as As the Palaces Burn. Don't Get me wrong New American Gospel is excellent, but Ashes of the Wake is just so damn good. My favorite song is The Faded Line, which has an excellet breakdown, almost as good as the breakdown in Ruin.  Album of the Year for me, which is pretty good since it beat Slipknot's Vol.3, which I thought would have won the title. Definitely worth every penny. The title song, which is an instrumental, is very creative and I'm very glad they put that on there. Other great songs are Hourglass, Blood of the Scribe, and Laid to Rest, which is one of Lamb of God's Best. So get up off your ass and go buy it from Best Buy because they have it for almost nothing!
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I would give this cd 0 stars if i could. i got it cause my friend recomened it to me for the song \\"My Band\\" which in itself is a piece of s**t, and is only the slightest bit funny. this cd is actually worst than anything beastie boys have put out, and i didn't think that was possible. this is terrible stuff. get into some nirvana or stp or trapt if you want some good music. just don't listen to this.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I saw `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', and thought it was a breath of fresh air from all the usual Hollywood movies that were getting released lately. Rarely do you get to see such a movie that makes you think of what a unique concept the storyline of the movie is, commend on the actor's performances, and also make you feel good about the movie. `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' does exactly that. <br /> <br />The story revolves around Joel (played by Jim Carrey) who meets Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) and starting a relationship with her. However, later Clementine gets tired of being with Joel, and decides to go to this organization that removes memories from the minds of various people. Clementine loses all her memories of Joel. Joel, on the other hand, discovers what has happened and decides to get this mind erased as well...but during the process realizes how precious some of his memories with Clementine were. Can he stop his memories from getting erased in time? Will he win Clementine back or has he lost her forever? <br /> <br />`Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind' is a very unique movie unlike any other that I have ever seen. It gives a very surreal effect while you are watching the movie, yet after you have finished seeing it, makes you feel that the story is really believable. From the first scene itself, you will be drawn to the story immediately. Although it is a little hard to understand what is going on at first, in the end, you find that everything fits into place and makes sense. Even though I was a little skeptic about whether Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet would pair off well in the movie before watching it, they both gave a wonderful performance. They played their roles very compellingly to make me convinced that they are really talented to be playing roles that they are not usually famous for. Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood acted well too. The special effects add well to the scenes, and the background music fits perfectly to the various situations during the movie. All in all, if you liked movies like `Being John Malkovich', you will definitely love this movie! <br />
0805017445|5.0|My 3 year old daughter has been enjoying this book since she was about 9 months old. We've made the words into a bit of a rap song. She loves the different colors of the animals, (some not found in nature!) and she loves the multi-ethnic kids at the end. Wonderful!
0393035158|5.0|It is really incredible to see this book reviewed negatively by people who admit that they haven't read it.  Amazing!  It might be useful for such people to know that they can read part of the first chapter for free on the author's website ([...] which is what convinced me to buy this book myself.  Harris is going straight up against every taboo that surrounds our discussion of religion and values in this country.  Which is why he'll be drawing a lot of fire from people who are eager to dismiss his argument without even considering it.  Harris might be right in what he says at the end of the first chapter: <br /> <br />\\"It is imperative that we begin speaking plainly about the absurdity <br />of most of our religious beliefs. I fear, however, that the time has <br />not yet arrived. In this sense, what follows is written very much in <br />the spirit of a prayer. I pray that we may one day think clearly <br />enough about these matters to render our children incapable of <br />killing themselves over their books. If not our children, then I suspect <br />it could well be too late for us, because while it has never been <br />difficult to meet your maker, in fifty years it will simply be too easy <br />to drag everyone else along to meet him with you.\\"
0805053883|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this book. We usually read \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" first. Then we read this one. My daughter has stuffed animals and Fisher Price toys of each of the animals in this book. She likes to line them up and pick up each one as we read about them in the book. Wonderful.
B000148KK2|3.0|I heard Diana Krall at Blue Alley with the other 40 some people, just before she became a superstar. This is a risky album for her.Ok JazzBrat - here it is, criticism without slinging insults!<br /><br />The more positive aspects of this album are that Diana is back with a small group where she does best, no schlocky violins. The music is relaxed and laid back. And I am generally in favor of the concept of expanding Jazz standards to include some Rock and Pop hits. I liked her version of \\"Love me like a Man\\" like Bonnie Raitt, that's punchy and \\"Stop this World\\" great cynical Mose Allison tune, \\"Black Crow\\" and hubby's best song, \\"Almost Blue\\".<br /><br />But on the other hand, to my ear, there is a curious lack of energy here, a lack of spark. Some of her earlier small group albums seemed more involving, grabbed me and dragged me in. Captivated my attention. That quality seems missing here, the emotion is somehow burned out and listless. Diana has always had a low energy delivery. But that's a knife edge,  \\"Blessed are the sleepy, for they shall drop off!\\", to coin a phrase. This CD needs more energy.<br /><br />Some Rock and Pop songs might become the new Jazz standards but not many, most don't seem like they'll make the grade. They leave me scratching my head wondering why she included these.<br /><br />I've listened a few times, but it doesn't pull me back. disagree? what's your opinion? write. On my tough grading scale -2 to 3 stars, some good and many cuts boring.<br /><br />This is being sold in the Rock/Pop section, as well as the Jazz/Vocal section too, who knows, maybe it will succeed in awakening some younger listeners to real music.
0399226907|5.0|My 3 year old daughter enjoys this wonderful story. She loves that the caterpillar turns into a beautiful butterfly at the end. She has also received the video of this book, as well as a Very Hungry Caterpillar stuffed doll. She loves them all. Eric Carle's artwork is modern yet accessible.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|Word on the street is Led Zep refused to let their performance be a part of this DVD release.  I am still gonna purchase this baby.  The Queen segment alone may well be worth it.  Let's not forget Mick Jagger tearing off Tina Turner's skirt, Boomtown Rats \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\", Ultravox, Prince's video for \\"Tears in Your Eyes\\" and so much more. <br /> <br />Sorry about the 3 star rating.  I had to enter something.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a confusing mess.  <br />He wants us to believe he has uncovered the truth about 9/11. Among these \\"truths\\" Moore reveals is the assinine assumption that the war in Afghanistan was not fought because the Taliban was harboring bin Laden and al-Qaeda but because the Unocal Oil Company wanted to run a natural gas pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea. Of course, Unocal has headquarters in Texas, George W. Bush's home state. The United States had to invade Afghanistan before Iraq to make this profit-making venture a sucess.  <br /> <br />Moore also depicts Iraq as a land of peace and joy (children laughing and playing, flying kites, etc.) Michael Moore neglects to show the dead children gassed by Saddam's forces, or Iraq's mass graves, or the torture videos, etc.  <br /> <br />Moore insists he's reporting facts- but when you only supply a part of the facts- well, it isn't really the truth, is it?  <br /> <br />If you'd like a bipartisan depiction of 9/11, read the Commission Report.  <br /> <br />If you want cheap, unreliable, dishonest fodder to \\"Bush-bash\\"- this is your film... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002A3T|5.0|What I strongly want to say is NEVER BELIEVE THE CRITICS REVIEW...as it is written by some Roger Waters fan...NOT A REAL MUSIC LOVER. There's no doubt that \\"High Hopes\\" is the most beautiful song ever released by Pink Floyd. Thats not junk guitar noises, but it creates emotions through David Gilmour's guitar. I strongly recommend this album for any music fan.
B00005JL78|3.0|I doubt this guy can do any other role. Each time he's the same, and in none of his roles can you differentiate between the characters. I found some points in this movie extremely slow, although it speeded up towards the end, and I got really into it.<br /><br />What I found funny about this movie, was the fact that I didn't recognise Samantha Morton until she came out of her 'bath'. She's got one of those recognisable faces. I had a laugh during the movie, cos I could hear the conversation between her & her agent in my head. It probably went something like this:<br /><br />Agent: I have a role for you Samantha. What you have to do all the time is cling onto Tom Cruise ...<br /><br />Samantha: I'll take it!<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />Samantha: What's the catch?<br /><br />Agent: You have to shave you head, and when you're not clinging onto Tom, you spend most of your time in a bath.<br /><br />Samantha: Oh ...<br /><br />The rest of the cast include of course Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow, who was one of the priests in The Exorcist.<br /><br />I normally like Colin Farrell in movies - especially in Daredevil, with his Orish accent. But in this, he annoyed the hell out of me! And why? It wasn't because of his funny sounding accent. No, it was because he was constantly chewing gum. His mouth was so distracting, it was like watching a cow chewing cud. And why was this I wonder, the fact there was absolutely no one smoking in the movie?! Apparently, he also had a lot of trouble delivering the line &#34;surely you understand the fundamental questionability of Pre-Crime methodology&#34;.<br /><br />There's quite a few famous cameos in this, mainly in the train scene, so you have to keep your eyes peeled for them. These include: Paul Thomas Anderson (who directed Tom Cruise in Magnolia and it is reported that he is so hard to find that Anderson himself does not know where he appears; Cameron Crowe,  Tom's director from Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky as the guy who looks at Anderton over the top of his newspaper and recognizes him; and Cameron Diaz, Tom's co-star in Vanilla Sky plays the blonde woman sitting just behind the man who looks over at Anderton on the train.<br /><br />The PreCogs I found really interesting, and of course a woman - Samantha Morton - was the main PreCog, the one had intelligence, of course, what else would we expect? Although it's rarely mentioned (I don't remember hearing the male PreCogs names mentioned) the PreCogs&#34; were all named after famous mystery writers. Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon), 'Conan Doyle, Arthur' (Sherlock Holmes), and Agatha Christie (Murder on the Orient Express).<br /><br />What my Dad managed to point out, were the references to Stanley Kubrick movies:<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton undergoes his eye replacement procedure, his eyes are held open by clamps, reminiscent of the treatment sequences in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Burgess, (Max von Sydow) is named after author Anthony Burgess, who also wrote about crime control in the future in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Directly after the opening montage of the husband murdering his wife, it cuts directly to a close-up shot of the &#34;precog&#34; Agatha's eye. The exact same shot is used at the end of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey after the light show.<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton jumps off the car and through the window, he lands into a yoga classroom. The head of the class is dressed exactly like the rich old woman Alex kills in A Clockwork Orange. Like Alex, Anderton is characterized by his drug abuse and love of classical music.<br /><br />--&#62; When John Anderton and Agatha are running out of the shopping mall, they pass by a homeless man laying in front of the door who asks for change. The vagrant in the tunnel scene in A Clockwork Orange, where Alex and his droogs beat him is reminiscent of this.<br /><br />--&#62; Agatha yelling &#34;murder!&#34; a reference to &#34;redrum!&#34; from Shining, The (1980).<br /><br />and also Bladerunner (both this & Bladerunner were written by Philip K Dick, although in the credits, this is based on a SHORT story by the author):<br /><br />--&#62; Both films begin with an extreme close-up shot of an open eye, and repeat the eye motif throughout.<br /><br />--&#62; Rutger Hauer's character (in Blade Runner) visits the genetic engineer who created his artificial eyes, Tom Cruise's character visits the surgeon who replaces his eyes.<br /><br />--&#62; Both films feature detectives making a key discovery by spotting a woman reflected in the mirror in the background of a crime-scene image that they are looking at.<br /><br />--&#62; Several times, bright shafts of light pour in through the windows behind the characters as they talk; this effect was used extensively in the earlier film.<br /><br />--&#62; After Cruise's encounter with Crowe, he drives with Agatha through a gorgeous green scenery, and tells her they're going &#34;Someplace safe&#34;, a scene which parallels the ending scene of Blade Runner (the original, not the Director's Cut version)<br /><br />--&#62; As Anderton and Agetha leave the shopping mall they pass a woman on the left hand side carrying an umbrella with an integrated light. This appears identical to those carried by the citizens of Los Angeles in Blade Runner when Deckard walks the streets.<br /><br />I haven't seen either of these movies, mainly because A Clockwork Orange freaks me out too much, and we don't have Bladerunner on DVD. I also noticed similarities to the Matrix (mainly just because of those little spider things, when they're looking for Anderton), and Back To The Future, but I suppose it was just all the future stuff.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, although there was a lot of talking about nonsense, which simple people will NOT understand. I'd highly recommend it, if you can stand watching Tom & Colin long enough for Samantha to steal the movie away from them.34; from Shining, The (1980). <br /> <br />and also Bladerunner (both this & Bladerunner were written by Philip K Dick, although in the credits, this is based on a SHORT story by the author): <br /> <br />--&#62; Both films begin with an extreme close-up shot of an open eye, and repeat the eye motif throughout. <br />--&#62; Rutger Hauer's character (in Blade Runner) visits the genetic engineer who created his artificial eyes, Tom Cruise's character visits the surgeon who replaces his eyes. <br />--&#62; Both films feature detectives making a key discovery by spotting a woman reflected in the mirror in the background of a crime-scene image that they are looking at. <br />--&#62; Several times, bright shafts of light pour in through the windows behind the characters as they talk; this effect was used extensively in the earlier film. <br />--&#62; After Cruise's encounter with Crowe, he drives with Agatha through a gorgeous green scenery, and tells her they're going &#34;Someplace safe&#34;, a scene which parallels the ending scene of Blade Runner (the original, not the Director's Cut version) <br />--&#62; As Anderton and Agetha leave the shopping mall they pass a woman on the left hand side carrying an umbrella with an integrated light.

B000035P7X|5.0|Dylan doesn't take crap from anybody in this extremely entertaining rockumentary. This DVD shows Bob Dylan on top of the world. The tour where he went from unplugged to plugged-in. Bob Dylan is in no way a sell-out. A lot of the DVD shows Dylan debating with a series of different people; mostly reporters that want an interview. He just blows them off, giving them absolutely nothing to write about and making them feel stupid in the process. Dylan is in your face; sticking it to the man every chance he gets. The discussions on the film really give you great insight into the way Dylan thinks and feels. He talks about his feelings as an atheist. He also seems to be pretty annoyed that people think he plays \\"folk\\" music. Most of the time, he seems to be having fun with the individual he's debating with; trying to get a rise out of them.<br /><br />If you like Bob Dylan's lyrics, this is an essential piece of Bob Dylan's discography. Bob Dylan is like an open book. This gives you a lot of insight to Bob Dylan's personality off-stage. One of the best rockumentaries I have ever purchased.
B000002KKD|4.0|I mean this is a first cd so you have to kind of give them a break but it has 52 girls on it so you got to love that as well as Palnet Claire and Rock Lobster. Other than that just the song about the phone number are the real solid tracks I think otherwise kind of bland.
B000007443|5.0|cream of the crop musicians playing superb jazz. The track 'Islands' is one of the most beautiful and well crafted tunes I have ever heard. The ensemble playing on that track is excellent and tasteful, as are the solos. Peter Erskine's drumming is flawless. This CD will make a great additon to any music collection. No showboating here, just excellent musicians playing some great jazz.

B0001EKZOQ|5.0|This cd combines one of the greatest flamenco singers of today, cantaor Diego El Cigala, with one of Cuba's finest Afro-Cuban pianists, Bebo Valdes. The feeling and power contained in this album can not be described. Cigala's voice comes from a deep dark place, and nurtures your soul with a operatic tone. Bebo piano is flawless, the harmony and the ability to carry the Flamenco classics is wonderful.  If you are a fan on music and musicianship this album is a skilled hunter which captures both. The booklet contain the lyrics in English and fantastic pictures.  If you are a fan of jazz, opera, rock you will love this one of a kind master piece.
0393035158|5.0|The light of reason, long over shadowed by out dated rituals to parent figures from the neatherworlds, comes to center stage at last. A must read for any rational person. Fear in devils is not near as real as the fear of planes flying into buildings or religious sucide bombings. It's time to take a long hard look at the real world, the one whos existence is in little question.
B00028HBL6|5.0|For those people who complain that the movie is anti-Semetic, please, read the Bible and numerous historical texts that make reference to Jesus being brought to the Romans by the Jewish Pharisees. And yes, Jesus was Jewish so that would kind of deafeat that argument anyway. So were his mother and father.
B00005JNEI|5.0|It is so refreshing to see all this material in one awesome film.  It amazed me that I could go from belly laughing to burning anger to horror and disbelief all within 2 hours. <br /> <br />Right-Wing Pundits are afraid of what would happen if we were truely an informed democracy, so they try and poke holes in Michael Moore's films.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, see this movie... even if you are a right-wing fundamentalist, you need to see the otherside of this glory war against Iraq, and the otherside of your beloved President Bush.
B000002HH9|4.0|I have been a Cure fan for a long long time now and simply love thier old dark music. Seventeen Seconds is my favorite album, so Im not a Cure singles fiend who only listens to the pop. Unfortunately I fell victim to peer pressure, and when I heard Wild Mood Swings was crap I avoided it at all costs. I should have known better. I finally bought this album and to my surprise I found nothing wrong with it. Its just a different side of the Cure that I find highly amusing. I agree its not their best but its still great music. Its almost comical the way Robert does his own take on different styles of music and makes it work.  In my oppinion this is the last album in which the Cure sounds unique. Too much of their new songs sound exactly the same (Bloodflowers) while every song on WMS is different from one another, note the title. Lighten up a little and enjoy it, its a side of The Cure and Robert we rarely hear so take it in for its creativity. Its the Cure so it cant be that bad. I have noticed all of the bad reviews never point out what they think is wrong with the album.... have you even listened to it?
0345446798|3.0|This book is ok if you have a dog that's just a dog and not a member of your family.  Although I spent a lot of time training my dog, i also treat him like a child, taking him with me everywhere I can, including vacations.  The author of this book really focuses on problematic dogs, so if you have a dog that has some serious issues, like aggression, read this book.  However, if you have a dog that just needs some training, I would not recommend this book.  It is not easy to read, there is no sequence to the chapters, there is no \\"here is what you need to do to get your dog to ....\\"  Perhaps this book is for a more advanced dog trainer.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. Co-starring a padded bra as Lara's breasts.<br /><br />It's all I could ask in a summer movie - originality, action, a novel stunt or two, complete lack of plot, and breasts. First: the breasts, both of them. Since the Tomb Raider game was aimed at adolescent boys, physics and anatomical plausibility never limited the original Lara. Since the computer game was aimed at adolescent boys with mothers, the breasts stay covered, or at least off screen. I can barely imagine the building permit needed to construct a Lara-like padded bra, but the construction was successful. The bra's shape and movement reminded me in many ways of a human figure's. It disappointed me in one scene, though, where tee-shirted Lara climbs out of a moat into the chill of an ice-bound castle. The bra just couldn't rise to the occasion, and missed what could have been the high points of its role.<br /><br />As to the plot, imagine a movie cut into twenty or thirty sections, scrambled, and spliced back together at random. Would you notice the difference? In Raider's case, probably not. That seems true to the original game, where a clueless player guides Lara randomly and repetitively through hazards meant to challenge a pre-teen on a sugar buzz. Movies from games rank just below movies from comic books for attention span and continuity - if you were looking for either, you probably picked up the wrong disc by mistake.<br /><br />There's plenty of action, as in the game, without depending too much on chases, explosions, and fire. This may be the best feature of the movie: thoughtful, varied mayhem. The swashbuckling was only improved by being buckled onto Lara. Violence was mostly bloodless, although Lara briefly suffered a boo-boo on her arm. Gadgeteering, computer graphics, and stunts were pretty good. One of my favorite scenes was Lara's aerial ballet. You could easily see the bungee cords in that sequence - you were supposed to. I left wondering, though. Could she really have done all that on the ropes we saw, or was she also suspended by invisible ropes during the scene with the visible ropes? Make the most of that speculation. It's about as deep as Tomb Raider ever gets.<br /><br />The movie really stands out for its use of originality. The wardrobe closet, dozens of identical outfits, was quite original when it first appeared in 'Last Action Hero'. I think the combination jungle gym and planetary model was original to 'Dark Crystal'. The uber-geek sidekick with advanced Personality Deficit Disorder and grooming malfunctions was probably original at some point, long before his appearance in 'Short Circuit'. The bring-it-down-around-their-ears ending to every 007 movie may not have been James Bond's at first, but he made it his own. There was lots of originality in Raider, but I'm sad to say it was all someone else's.<br /><br />Tomb Raider is a fine bit of fluff, and you might enjoy it unless you liked Cider House Rules or Snow Falling on Cedars. You might enjoy it more if you're a testosterone-driven teenaged boy, or were one, or know one. This movie won't sink any of the actors' careers, but it probably won't launch any, either. Except maybe the padded bra's - the bra may get an Oscar for best supporting role.all that on the ropes we saw, or was she also suspended by invisible ropes during the scene with the visible ropes?

B000002UAF|3.0|The Beatles' A Hard Days Night album is the first full-fledged album to feature Beatles originals and to date is the only Beatles album to feature exclusively Lennon-McCartney songwriting credits.     The album if full of sprightly 60's pop gems, a handful of hits and a few rarely heard album cuts that are quite interesting. The music is energetic, past-paced, melodious and enjoyable. The vocals dominate, with a lot of really good harmonies and passionate singing. There are also more mysterious tracks that highlight their ability to write very original melodies.  Highlights include the up-tempo title track, the exuberant 'Money can't buy me love', the tender ballad 'And I love her' (all hits), and then other favourites include the melodic, well written 'Things we said today' and the cowbell driven rocker 'You can't do that', my pick is the joyous 'I should have known better', with harmonica and feels very celebratory.    Although writing every song themselves is a great achievement, tracks like 'Tell me why' and 'When I get home' are quite weak, and 'I'm happy just to dance with you' is not that charming, actually, and actually it'd be great if there was an energetic rock n roll cover to finish the album. That said, there is still a lot of strong material on here and 'A Hard Days Night' is one of the better early Beatles albums', so a rating of 3 1/2 seems about right. You'll enjoy it, and has a few beauties to boot!
0345440900|4.0|So far using this book has given us great guidelines to use for our newborn.  Reading it before the baby arrived prepared us to handle the many unknowns we dealt with in the very first days and weeks.  I especially referred to the parts about body language and different types of crying.  It seemed like she knew our little one to a &quot;T&quot;.  This book may not be for everyone, however I personally appreciate the &quot;routine&quot; and structure that the book promotes, it has made life fairly predictable and flexible for me.  I found the nursing info to work well for me when paired with advice from my midwife and childbirth classes.  I'm not sure what book some of the other commenters read, but I have found plenty of freedom and flexibility, lots of time for affection and cuddling and yes, plenty of sleep.   If this is a tool you want to use I highly recommend reading it before your baby arrives and starting it as soon as you can.  However, as with every book, keep in mind that these are guidelines and opinions and it won't replace you're common sense and mothering instincts.  It's easy to get caught up the rules and forget that that your dealing with a little person and not a predictable machine.
B000002JSR|1.0|I don't see why they even bothered releasing this album. It was a complete waste of time seeing as how Jon Bonham died two years before and Robert and Jimi didn't like each other very much. I think this one didn't even go gold.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album really isn't as bad as many people say. But a few songs were either not that good or too long, to i had to take away some stars. Here's a track-by-track analysis:<br /><br />1. Fuel-10/10-A good way to start an album. It's miles ahead of Load's starter, Ain't My B****.<br /><br />2. Memory Remains-10/10-Also a good song.<br /><br />3. Devil's Dance-10/10-I love the bass in this song.<br /><br />4. Unforgiven II-10/10-Not a bad rendition<br /><br />5. Better Than You-6/10-Repetitive, crappy lyrics.<br /><br />6. Slither-7/10-WTF? THIS is a bad rendition of Enter Sandman!!!<br /><br />7. Carpe Diem Baby-7/10-OK song<br /><br />8. Bad Seed-8/10-Good song.<br /><br />9. Where the Wild Things Are-10/10-FINALLY! Another 10/10 song!<br /><br />10. Prince Charming-7/10-<br /><br />11. Low Man's Lyric-7/10-WTF? Metallica doing soft rock? It's not really that bad a song though.<br /><br />12. Attitude-5/10-I ussuaLLY SKIP THIS SONG.<br /><br />13. Fixxxer-20/10-awesome! This would be a 5 star album if every song were as good as this!<br /><br />Bootm line: It's actually a good album.
B000002J0B|5.0|Although nowhere as near as commercially successful as Led Zeppelin IV, this definately has some their greatest hits. Ocean is probably my second favorite Led Zeppelin song(next to Whole Lotta Love). What I love about these later albums is that Robert Plant no longer moans like a woman but he sings like a Viking warrior about to conquer the Newfoundland maincoast. I know you're probably thinking:\\"is this guy high? what does he mean by whatever he said?\\" Robert Plant's voice is what kind of discouraged me from Zeppelin in the first place. In Led Zeppelin II he actually does sing and it sounds absolutely awesome, but in Led Zeppelin IV he sounded like a woman having an orgasm. Its good to see Zeppelin back in working order after the most heinously overated album in history. I especially like Page's evolved guitar work, he still not in the top 10 but he certainly is in the top 25. Overall, Led Zeppelin is a great band, but they are still not the greatest.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Dark side: We're getting the \\"special\\" editions only. Bright side: We get it letterbox or in widescreen. I think most people are attracted to the new enhancements because they're used to fuzzy, pan-and-scan versions of the films. The word needs to get out that if the originals were fully restored from their nitrate negatives and presented letterboxed they would be beutiful. After all, we're talking about bright beutiful film, not a video game. The movies are supposed to look better than some ugly computer game based on it. As a matter of fact, why don't some of these rude people just play the game and give the movie to the people who truely apreciate and respect it. This is altering film, and it's like colorizing STEAMBOAT WILLY. As much as I respect Mr. Lucas for making the films in the first place I do find him a bit of a hypocrite. He was bashing the new colorized THREE STOOGES dvd yet he won't let people who love the original (which made the STAR WARS franchise famous in the first place) have what's so deserved. Give him a few years to alter the movies more and more and they'll be complety unreconizable.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica are pure metal geniuses! They came from playing opening act for the likes of Saxon to having their own summer tour Summer Sanitarium. Anybody who is a true metalhead will realize the genious of this band and worship them enclatura. I have no idea what that word means but Metallica has done it again with S&M. This proves that bands like Kiss and Aerosmith will never match up with Metallica when it comes to who is America's best band. Metallica has done all that they have, and has exceeded all of their records so around the year 2015, expect the dudes at Metallica to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am an Agnostic, but am well aware of the impact that Jesus Christ has had on the history of humanity.  Mel Gibson deserves all the credit in the world for creating this most realistic of all Crucifixion films.  Gibson's shocking depiction of the incredible suffering endured by Jesus actually leaves the viewer shaken; how could one man endure such torture?<br /><br />Jim Caviezel gives the performance of a lifetime.  Under piles of bloody makeup, his eyes say everything.  No grandiose pronouncements here - just suffering.  Gibson lets the viewer ponder just how vicious and hateful humankind is capable of being.  One watches the awful flogging of Jesus and can't help but think of all the monstrous genocidal rampages that have taken place throughout our history.  The perpetrators seem almost drunk in their enjoyment at inflicting such pain...they laugh and joke about it.<br /><br />One also cannot help but consider just how powerful one person's death can become.  Jesus death eventually brought about the conquest of the most powerful empire on Earth by the religion his sacrifice created.  It is unfortunate indeed that so much violence has been committed in the name of the great man who literally gave everything he possessed to save mankind from itself...how many massacres and wars have been taken place in the name of God and Jesus, the Prince of Peace?
B000002JSN|5.0|Although the material on here is worthy of only 4 stars, I'm giving it 5 because Zeppelin decided to do the right thing, step down from the spotlight and let the other big boys bully the media. I don't mean to be negative, but after this album and until How the West was Won, nobody really said that much about Zeppelin, and everybody else had something else to talk about. But then of course, they just had to come up with that live album......
B0002CTSTK|1.0|I don't like how they made 2 movies instead of 1.  I refuse to put any money out either to rent or own Kill Bill #2.  I hope that movie producers do not follow this idea ever again......  It is a money grabbin technique for something that is really not that worth it......
B000002JSP|1.0|What is everybody's problem anyway, this album wasn't even successful. Plus, Led Zeppelin, \\"the greatest band on the planet\\", lost their drummer and called it quits. Come on, surely the greatest band of all time could find the perfect replacement, seems like they could survive for more than 11 years. Let me give you a list of bands that continue after losing a band member and you guys can shut up about Led Zeppelin being the best band ever. <br />Bands which have lost a band member and have continued afterward. <br />Metallica:Cliff Burton(bassist):one name, Jason Newstead <br />Def Leppard:im not a real big fan but I heard they lost their guitar player, but they reformed the band and continued. <br />The Who:Keith Moon(drummer):The Who hired a new drummer and they later recorded 'You Better you Bet' <br />Lynard Skynard:The whole damn band!(their relatives recreated it like 5 years after their deaths) <br />Motley Crue:Nikki Sixx(bassist):Had an enormous drug overdose which left him dead, but while in ambulance, he suddenly resurrects, so all hail Nikki! <br />Mayhem:Norweigan death metal band:frontman commits suicide, guitarist eats frontmans brains, bassist kill guitarist, bassist goes to jail and escapes only to be caught again. The only original member is the drummer. <br />Kiss:Eric Sarr(drummer):died while on tour, they replaced him and continued playing. <br />Ac/Dc:Bon Scott(frontman):died choking on his own vomit. Ac/Dc replaces him with Brian Johnson, and enjoy the most successful years of their carrers. <br />Ozzy Osbourne:Randy Rhoads(guitarist):died tragically at the young age of 25 when the plane he was in crashed into a house and everyone aboard was killed. After months of depression at the lost of his best friend, Ozzy releases Bark at the Moon with new guitarist Jake E. Lee. <br />Randy Castillo(former Ozzy and Motley Crue drummer):died of some kind of cancer. Wasn't in any band at that time, but a ton of people showed up for his funeral. <br /> <br />So as you can see, these guys have no excuse. They only lost the drummer man, and he was old. I mean come on, if Nikki Sixx could rise from the dead, why cant Jon Bonham? If Ozzy can come back stronger than ever from losing the best friend he ever had in a plane accident, then Led Zepplin has no excuse.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I had this dvd set with the first season of Smallville on the shelf for a while now. I never came to actually watching it. But after watching all of '24', The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, etc. I decided to pop it in. Of course it's nowhere near as impressive as the mentioned above, but I must admit I am kinda hooked. And yes, for what I've seen all episodes kinda feel the same. Every week a new villain and the 'never really' relationship between Clark an Lana. But it is a fun and entertaining series nevertheless. Great loveable characters, nice acting and great music. I feel that it is written for the younger generation (yes I already feel old at 29) but I must admit I love the show. And I don't no if it's legal, I love Lana as well (she's sooooo beautiful). I already bought season two and pre-ordered season 3. That's the advantage of starting series later on. You have still a lot of catching up to do. And with Smallville for me that's a joy. Don't take it all to seriously by finding all kind of plotholes, just enjoy.
B0000060NF|5.0|R&B albums of all time, but one of the most influential, pioneering, and consistent albums in the history of popular music. Yes it has hits, but it is better taken as a whole, much like \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". If you don't own this album then you cannot call yourself an R&B fan or a popular music fan -- it is THAT essential. <br />
0446677450|2.0|Allow me to sum up what the Rich teach their children.  Invest your money and only spend from what those investments earn you. <br /> <br />Now on to what the book lacks: <br /> <br />1. Concrete lessons about investing and money management. <br />2. Numbers to demonstrate how the secret above works. <br />3. Coherent story telling and editing. <br /> <br />The first is derived from the book's primary function which is to entice the reader to purchase more books and materials from the same system, in hopes of finding employable strategies to make money.  This book is foremost a money making proposition, and secondly a commercial.  The second deficiency is surprising in a book written by a CPA.  However, I refer you to the first deficiency.  Lastly, this failing likely comes from the fact the book was written by a CPA.  Many people would feel that this lends some sort of credibility to the work, and my guess is that this was the intent.  I base my assumption on the fact that in  Robert's own words, he recommends hiring the best people for any given job.  Anyone should be able to tell you that a CPA is not \\"the best\\" writer for the job. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to invest your twelve dollars and at most check this book out at the library.
0790729377|5.0|All the critics agree about one thing: there had never been a performance before in American movies like Marlon Brando gave in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. I have seen this movie many times and never tire of it. Although Brando would make other fine movies, he would never make one better. Vivien Leigh is also amazing as the fragile Blanche who is sinking into madness. Even with the stagey set, which looks like a set, the characters explode on the screen.<br /><br />It seems to me that you do not compare Brando's performance and this movie to other films but rather to other great American artistic works: Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\", Toni Morrison's BELOVED, ANGELS IN AMERICA, for example. A truly great movie.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus has done us quite a favor: the guy who doesn't seem to fit in any catagory (is it rock? alt? folk? jazz? what is this?) has added a spash of broadway to an already ecclectic mix. A chorus of banjos, tubas bum-bumming, trumpets blaring, sit back enjoy the unicity of Rufus Wainwright. <br />Some of these songs are beautiful, reflective and relaxing. Some make me want to run out in the yard with my shoes off (like a beautiful child). You'll find someting for every mood here.  <br />Wanting Want 2.
B000001EKX|4.0|Why this album doesn't have the same punch that the rest of the albums with the original line up?  Because we were too busy hearing to the KISS ALBUM, ALIVE I, DESTROYER and the rest.  We kind of keep it under the bed until the 90's that they started playing in the REVENGE tour songs like PARASITE, GOT TO CHOOSE, WATCHIN' YOU and in the unpluged concert that they played the almost forgot GOING BLIND and the absolutely forgotten COMIN' HOME.<br /><br />I really like this one it has everything a good hard rock album has, but it was darkened, maybe the same band did it, but who knows?<br /><br />It doesn't sound too good and the production is quite poor, maybe Bob Ezrin would have done something better. The cover is interesting and it was a great idea to create something japanese considering that they haven't gone to Japan.  The back cover is the best, this is like KISS on drugs, looks like a big party (at least that's what they say). Don't take much of a word from the members (especially Gene), they would say anything to sell anything.<br /><br />Thank God for the remaster release, the old one is crap: no pictures and a bad sound is the worst combination for a KISS CD.<br /><br />One question: On one interview (90's) Paul said that he and Ace haven't written a song together............Why is the credit for COMIN' HOME for the both?  Maybe his way to put Ace down.  I guessed someone forgot that question...........<br /><br />Highlight: Parasite, Watchin' you, Strange Ways.<br /><br />Lowlight: Mainline (What were you thinkin?), The original sound.
0380977788|5.0|Coraline (not caroline) has just moved to a house where there is nothing to play except her toys and outside in the garden of her flat. one day, she opens a door that leads her to a parallel universe, or a mirrored world of her own life. The toys are much much more fun, the food is mouthwatering, and she has a room where the walls are pink and green. As life maybe pleasurable, her pseudoparents are very disterbing. For one thing, they have skin like rice paper, and buttons for eyes. Now, she must come out of this world, and live with her real parents. <br />     As fun as this book was, it was very...disturbing. Not only in the text, but also in the illustrations. I was frightened at most of the pictures, and had nightmares at night too. For this book, i reccomend it to kids over 10, for disturbing images.
0375805613|5.0|I was born in 1980 and was fortunate to be around when Sesame Street was still in its prime.  I, like all other 4 and 5 year olds, loved the show and had Sesame Street books, lunchboxes, and other merchandise.  But this book I will always remember as being the most creative and safely suspenseful book for a young child.  My mother would always read this book to my brother and I before going to bed and all three of us delighted in Grover and his precocious antics of being so scared of the monster that was awaiting him and us, the reader, at the end.  And the book never got old, my mom read the story to us millions of time and it was still just as creative, fun, fresh, and a bit scary each time.  I highly recommend this book to any parent with young children.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have finally seen the Passion after reading the bashings in the NY Times, reviewing the harsh criticism and hearing the war of words for all these months.  It was not an anti-Semitic blood feast nor did I feel it necessarily celebrated violence for violence sake. It was violent, that is true, but in Gibson (and the audience's) mind, it was not mindless nor gratuitous, but an essential (maybe THE essential) aspect of the story.  It was, more than anything, a cinematic - not a spiritual - experience.  I might add, I have enjoyed Mel Gibson in almost every movie he has ever starred.   <br /> <br />This was as personal a story as one can get in that every nuance, thought and word was conceived in Gibson's mind - the Bible was only a prop. As he said, this is NOT the life of Jesus but the story of the Passion, those last days of his life.  The idea of using Aramaic and Latin was stunning but somehow \\"right\\". (By the way, if he had wanted to be historically accurate he would have used Aramaic and Greek - almost no Roman citizens spoke Latin in their daily life.)  <br /> <br />This is a pre-Vatican II Christ, the Savior of power and majesty who dies for the sins of us all. It overlooks the contradictory Gospel tales, papering over the obvious problems one encounters trying to reconcile the many stories that have come down to us from oral then written form.  Gibson did not follow any one of the versions rigidly but instead created his own, a distillation of Catholic, Bibical and historical traditions.   <br /> <br />This is also the story of Gibson's own journey from believer to wayward sinner and back to the fold, much as he did in SIGNS. The score was particularly effective and even if one does not share the supernatural aspects of the story, it is powerful and wrenching. An amazing accomplishment on both the personal and artistic levels.
B0002DB50E|5.0|VIDEODROME is one of David Cronenberg's finest films.  While not for everyone, it is sure to provoke some interesting reactions.  If you're going to dish out the money for the Criterion release then you probably already know about the film.  So, I'll just skip ahead and review this new set. <br /> <br />DISC 1. <br />The new transfer looks amazing, this is the best I have ever seen this film look.  There are two commentary tracks included.  The first is with Cronenberg and his D.P. Mark Irwin.  It's a very informative track.  Cronenberg always gives great insights into the workings of his films, while at the same time leaving just enough for the viewer to still have some questions to be answered alone.  The second track is with the films stars James Woods and Deborah Harry.  Woods is great while Harry doesn't really have much to say.  Still it is well worth a listen. <br /> <br />As if the film wasn't good enough Criterion included Cronenberg's short film \\"Camera\\" from 2000.  This 6 minute piece is amazing, thought provoking, creepy and even a little funny.  It is an excellent companion piece to Videodrome.  A must see for fans! <br /> <br />DISC 2. <br />The second disc has a few documentaries about the effects of the film and how they were produced.  They are all very interesting for fans of the film and for those interested in special effects in general.  Also present is the Videodrome transmissions and the footage from Samurai Dreams, with commentary by Cronenberg.  Fear on Film is a 26 minute round table discussion from 1982 with John Landis, John Carpenter and Cronenberg lead by Mck Garris.  While not the most exciting convo fans of the three will enjoy it.  This  disc also has stills from the set and lots of behind the scenes stuff as well. <br /> <br />This is the DVD of 2004 for me so far.  The film is amazing and the extras are a lot of fun.  I'm someone who general doesn't care about the extras on a DVD, but I have watched everything on these discs over the last day and it's all great stuff.  For sci fi fans, Cronenberg fans and those who like intelligent cinema this is a must have.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Gone With Wind. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Wizard of Oz. Casablanca. Star Wars. What do all these films have in common, you ask? Easy-all are icons of American culture, and true triumphs of the silver screen. So, when Star Wars (and its two sequels) joins those other films on DVD, you know it's going to be a very big deal. <br /> <br />However, in this case, Star Wars is *not* as we remember it, for George Lucas has decided to place the original versions of his landmark films (as well as his first film, THX-1138) on suppressed distribution in favor of a more extensively re-touched version of the 1997 Special Edition. Besides the spector of false advertisement (as Lucasfilm is pushing this release as *the* Trilogy), there's the matter that the special editions have changes that are uncalled for (Greedo shooting first) or simply there to mimic later efforts by ILM (the shockwaves eminating from both Death Stars are much like the shockwaves from Praxis in Star Trek VI). And, as others have stated, some changes (the reported changes to the lightsabers and lasers in this DVD edition and the changes to Mos Eisley) are more for the benefit of having great eye candy instead of great special effects. <br /> <br />With this said, I do like some of the changes (Cloud City looks nice, even if the original is visible in the background of most close-up shots), but I like being able to choose even more. Also, while the special features don't look to be as exhaustive as they could be, there's still quite a bit of value, making this set extremely tempting for all save the most jaded Star Wars fan.
6305308659|5.0|A modern day brother and sister David and Jennifer argue over what to watch on T.V. He wants to watch his favourite show 'Pleasantville'(a black and white show set in the 1950's); she wants to watch a music show. Their argument leads to the remote being broken at which point a mysterious repairman leaves them a new one which transports the pair to the idyllic Pleasantville. Finding themselves trapped in this monochrome world they try to fit in whilst finding a way back to reality.<br /><br />The people of Pleasantville have never experienced art, rain, colour, or anything less than perfection and have no awareness of a world or life outside of their town. The arrival of the two teenagers sparks a change and gradually colour and reality start encroaching on this little town. At this point we can see the uglier side of reality developing as some of the townspeople turn against the 'coloureds' and fight against any change in their existence.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film to watch. It has its magical, whimsical side whilst also managing to address the issue of prejudice. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon deliver great performances as the geeky brother and sparky sister and are a perfect foil for each other. Highly recommended
B00028HBKM|5.0|Excellent, excellent movie---left me feeling totally drained with my eyes puffy from crying.  I only wish that Mel Gibson had spent more time on the Resurrection; the brief little scene at the end left me wanting more.  Growing up in a Baptist church, I was taught that we should celebrate the life of Jesus and the fact that He rose from the dead, rather than the Crucifixion.  That is why the cross on our church wall is empty!  Christ Lives!
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a disgrace, how many lies can you pile in one movie? If you dont research your information, this movie is harmful. It has already been proven that the majority of the movie is lies, taken out of content, fabricated newspapers and documents, made to make our military and president look stupid. Michael Moore admits to being a communist. His movie is pushed to groups like Hamas as a anti American movie. This is harmful to every one, because if you think their were no democrats killed on 9/11 your a bigger fool than Michael Moore. Dont waste your money on this slob. He has been quoted over seas stating that the reason americans are walking around with smiles on their faces is because we are too stupid to know any better. Michael Moore has no dignity, and deserves a kick in the backside right out the country he thinks is so stupid.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I awaited this film anxiously for weeks. I even rented the 1st Vol. the day before (which is magnificent)and was totally disappointed.  In Vol. 1 Uma Thurman is just plain AWESOME. A unique heroine with a mission. Here she appears weak. It is not just the lack of violence and gore like some reviewres say but, the film is so predictible, It takes a 180 degree turn in the story, cinematography, and even the characters appear weaker. It also tries to build up a climax (which everyone is awaiting) that never occurs. The final scene is so bleak I actually thought \\"Ok, this was a cool joke.. now when are they going to show the real film\\"
0393035158|5.0|Harris has penned a masterful look at his own inner workings, which in turn can translate to us all. He explores the relationships between superstition, myth, and religions, in ways I had not contemplated. I highly recommend this book to all people who want to think for themselves, but it might not be for someone who wants to be told what to think every Sunday.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Alien 3 was a fine film by David Fincher.  <br />I liked the way he made it into kind of a gothic grim <br />horror flick. But it didn't really seem to respect its predecessors, and i dont think David watched Aliens at all <br />because the interrior of the USS Sulaco was nothing <br />like it was on Aliens. <br />At the end of the second film Ripley escapes the coloney  <br />and successfully boards the Sulaco, but unfortunatley, so <br />does the queen alien. After a long battle, she blows it <br />out of the airlock. Ripley and Newt, along with Hicks and Bishop <br />go to sleep in the cryo tubes. But little do they <br />know the queen has laid an egg on the Sulaco, and it <br />contains a queen facehugger. Wait a minute the cryo <br />tubes that Newt Hicks and Ripley were sleeping in were different <br />at the beginning of Alien 3 than they were at the <br />end of Aliens. In Aliens The cryo tubes that Newt, Hicks, and <br />Ripley were sleeping in, were made almost completely out <br />of glass and had a arm that lifted up <br />when the glass opened. In Alien 3, the cryo tubes were different <br />they looked more like the cryo tubes in the first Alien flick. <br />I couldn't really connect the film to Aliens it just seemed completley different. If you want a real continuation of <br />Aliens then Read the real story that came out BEFORE the <br />third film were Hicks and Newt LIVE.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have one thing to say to all you Star Wars purists:  GET A LIFE! <br /> <br />You guys are the ones that make the whole enjoyment of Star Wars seem more like some crazy religious fanatic cult.  What happened to the enjoyment of seeing a good old fashioned Sci Fi film?  It is after all just that: A MOVIE.  They are great they are awesome, and if they are revamped THEY ARE BETTER.  I didn't become a fan until somewhere in the mid 90's when the Special Edition came along.  But I am still as much a fan as all you old folks out there who think that being a fan means staying locked up in the past.  Move on, embrace the future.  I laugh at the day when we are watching our Star Wars movies on some kind of futuristic media format, still enjoying the magic of it, while all you purists will be watching your faded out and obsolete VHS versions, that is, if they still work.   <br /> <br />I for one cannot wait for my NEW editions of Star Wars trilogy.  What is the only thing I envy about you fanatical purists?  That you will still be in your comfy bed at 12:00 am on the 20th of Sept. when I'm getting my copy. <br /> <br />And that hardly seems worthwhile.
B000002A3T|5.0|This being the second floyd i have purchased, at first i did not like this album.Aboot six months later, its the only record i burn out to.I think its great that they continued since waters departed.Dont get me wrong, waters is a god, but he was getting his own way, and becoming a tyrant in the wall era. David is one of fav guitar players, and does some cool S*** on this album. My fav tracks are:Keep talking, wearng the inside out,high hopes,and poles apart. nick has also done some creative stuff on this album that i liked.nowadays, too many little posers pretend they like pink floyd, and have heard tracks like another brick in the wall,comfortably numb,and money and whatevers on the radio, and they try to be cool, but really, the would like to be listening to eminem,good charlotte and everything else that is gay and on mtv.you ask them if they are hard core pink floyd fans, and they dont even know aboot the division bell, then they dont know pink floyd. this album rules!!!!!
0385512104|4.0|I have so much respect now for parents of Autistic children. I knew it would be hard to raise one, but with the author's experience he gives an excellent picture of the far-reaching effects of an autistic child that the average person would never consider. And you want so much for him to be loved & accepted. Would definitely recommend this book! However, I disagree with Amazon's suggestion that if you like this, you will like \\"timetraveler's wife.\\" I just could NOT get through that very, very long book - did not hold my interest at all.
B000059XUO|5.0|Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) is back. Back from the dead to exact his revenge on the scumbags who raped and murdered his wife, not to mention killing Eric himself. With the help of a mysterious crow, and a young girl named Sarah, Draven sets out on his dark quest for overdue vengeance. THE CROW is a macabre tale of undying love and bitter loss, channeled into a resurrected instrument of death. Brandon Lee is the black soul that makes this movie impossible to ignore. He was born for and died for this role! THE CROW is the perfect halloween flick for those who like their superheroes a bit darker. The soundtrack is an unforgettable tribute to the entire decade of the 90s. The visuals are both visceral and visionary. This is bleakness and ultra-violence as fine art. Highly recommended...
B0002DRDBE|5.0|PLEASE do NOT pay any attention to the first review -- that guy is a moron and wouldn't know a good film if it slapped him in the face (which i feel like doing after reading his lame ass excuse for being Roger Ebert) He didnt like the film because it's in B&amp;W -- NICE -- i guess we should dismiss Citizen Kane as a great film as well then -- IDIOT!!! This is the film that started it all -- part 1 of the New Jersey Trilogy and by far Kevin Smith's BEST film -- i need not say any more EXCEPT that if you plan on buying ANY movie and this isn't already part of your collection, then your collection will never be complete until it is!!! watch it for yourself and enjoy pure comedic genious and wit at its best -- as for &quot;Anthony&quot; -- stick to &quot;She's All That&quot; because you don't even deserve to put this film into your DVD player!!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|. . . THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest zombie films ever made, and now finally has the greatest treatment of a DVD release! You get three different versions of this movie on a magnificent 4 disc set:  <br /> <br />-The US Theatrical Release <br />-The Extended version (aka Director's Cut) <br />-The Dario Argento cut (European version)  <br /> <br />And a whole disc full of extras and documentaries, including: <br /> <br />-\\"The Dead Will Walk\\" (a new documentary about the film with interviews with the cast and crew)  <br />-\\"Document of the Dead\\" (A great documentary made 1989 about George Romero's Dead Trilogy)  <br />-Home movies <br />-\\"Tour of the Monroeville Mall\\" with Ken Foree (Peter). <br /> <br />Also included is a cool preview DOTD comic book. <br /> <br />Easily the best DVD release of \\"DAWN OF THE DEAD\\" (1978), and the best DVD release for any single horror film. A MUST HAVE for Dawn, Romero, or zombie fans.
0156027321|4.0|Much has already been written about this Man Booker award-winning novel, so I will be brief and try to avoid repeating what has already been said by others.  I would definitely recommend the book as a good read.  It was given to me as a gift by a friend who had enjoyed it.  I can understand why.   <br />Pi Patel, the main character, presents himself as an expert in theology and zoology, both by education and experience.  He is a middle-aged man, recalling an amazing odyssey at sea in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  Pi, a 16-year old castaway orphaned by the shipwreck that cast his lot with the tiger, relied on his wits, his faith, and his knowledge of animals, to survive. <br />I give the book an A in zoology and an A as fiction.  It was readable, engaging, and I enjoyed the twist at the end. <br />I only have two real criticisms.  First, I found the fiction-posing-as-nonfiction premise annoying and unnecessary.  Second, I would give it a D in theology.  As an adherent to one of the three mutually exclusive faiths that Pi purports to embrace, his claim to be a devout Hindu, Christian and Muslim doesn't ring true.  These faiths, or at least the two of them that are monotheistic, are both exclusive in character and mutually exclusive.  I can't imagine that this aspect of the book, which wasn't really critical to the story, would appeal to any person who embraces a particular faith.   <br />Having said that, I would rate Life of Pi as a wonderful read.  It kept me up late at night, reading on to see what happened next.
B000001C6M|4.0|Slayer cook up some fast thrash on their genre defining debut album that blew their competition away at the time.  Slayer were quoted as saying they wanted to \\"out Venom Venom\\".  And they did.  When I first heard it in the '80s it was a revelation, few bands were as obnoxious and single minded in their exploration of dark themes and few played with the speed or power.  The music for the time, just ripped and it still does.  However looking back on this album I have to say that sonically it hasn't dated well.  The sound is in general thin, the vocals are too high in the mix with too much reverb, and the drums have that over compressed '80s sound.  Compared to later albums like the masterpiece Reign In Blood, Show No Mercy sounds a bit dated.  So consider yourself warned: although the songs and playing are excellent, the sound isn't what it could be.  I would recommend the Decade of Aggression album or Live Undead because the versions of the songs from Show No Mercy sound much more powerful played live.  But the music is in general excellent ripping speed/thrash metal and for a debut album it's very impressive, so I'm giving this 4 stars, one off for sound.  If there was ever an album that should be remixed, remastered this is the one, it would be a monster.
B00005JMX6|5.0|elisha cuthbert is amazing.  she deserves to be treated like a queen.  i haven't been shamelessly affected by a movie like this since jerry maguire.  one of the sweetest first-kiss scenes ever. <br /> <br />and to think, the previews just made this look like a total boner flick.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />elisha, I have moral fiber!!!!
B00006FIAZ|5.0|Truly great black metal from Sweden recorded in 1993.  The songs are complex, fast, melodic and hugely powerful due to the good production.  The vocals are nasty, sounding a bit like Abbath from Immortal channelling Quorthon.<br /><br />But Dissection add something unique to the black metal mix, a melodic sense unique to themselves and not found in other black or extreme metal bands.  Interspersed are three short acoustic songs which break up the onslaught and show the bands classical roots/abilities.  Great musicianship and dark intensity make this a must for any fan of black metal.
B00003W8NM|1.0|The film is a malicious and ugly descent into self-justifiable darkness. <br /> The film gently escorts the viewer along with the premise that the average life is awful so lets start fight clubs and hit each other. Fairly harmless premise and if it ended there it would be acceptable, however the fights have several motives: 1. they're used to desensitize the viewer to aggressive violence for whats to come later and 2. the harmless fight clubs have the same form and structure as the terroristic Project Mayhem, so the film tries to convince the viewer that if Fight Clubs are good, terroristic Project Mayhem is good. <br /> They bring you on board with the fights and reinforce the view that 'regular' life is so awful you cant make anything of it so just give up on it. A horribly cynical and destructive view of life. Once they have your thinking on this inevitable track, they then push you along to making terrorism an extension of Fight Club(i.e. cool). Strangely enough the film rails against society endlessly through the film yet the target of Project Mayhem are credit card companies. If society is so unredeemable how would blowing up credit card companies and resetting debt to 0 accomplish anything at all? The film doesnt even make sense in its own perverted world view. <br /> <br /> Once Project Mayhem becomes revealed the film becomes more and more hazy on what exactly is going on. Obviously its some sort of internal struggle, some say its a visual depiction of mind control, some say MPD. The film didnt have the guts to explain itself so we'll never know for sure.  <br /> <br /> All I do know is that anyone suggesting someone give up on life and actively destroy society because its not perfect(which is exactly what this film suggests) is wrong. We've seen what happens when a whole nation takes on this self-destructive mindset, it happened in Communist Russia and Communist China to diabolical results.
B00009Z576|3.0|When this album came out I was convinced that it would be horrible as Wakeman and more importantly Jon Anderson weren't on it. Assumptions can be wrong and its taken me 20+ years to realize that I wrote this album off prematurely. Geoff Downes adds some much needed energy and synth expertise to the keyboard chair. His choice of sounds and playing really liven up this album. I wonder now how much better Tormato might have been had Wakeman quit after Going For the One? Downes just sounds more modern (and tasteful) than Wakeman. In fact everybody sounds energized. The songs are simpler than was usual with Yes but the energy level is high, even joyful. Unfortunatley Trevor Horn is more of a liability than an asset. His vocals simply don't have the passion or range that Jon Anderson has. The lyrics in general aren't as good as Andersons and Horn is somewhat robotic and wooden in his phrasing. Andersons' absence was the primary reason I didn't buy this album in the first place and he is missed. But even with Anderson missing this is an enjoyable, albeit forgotten album of pop/prog Yes and is one of Yes's best from the '80s.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica may not have been the first band to play thrash, but they did a hit a high mark with this album. As with any great album, Ride the Lightning picks up and never lets go. All of the band members are well represented on this record, particularly Kirk Hammet, whose soloing never got any better afterwards. Many of the band's best cuts are present on this cd: You got Fight Fire with Fire, the title track and my personal favorite, For whom the Bell Tolls. Metallica did not make a better album after this one, however that is my opinion; you may not be agreeing with me and that it is fine. In any case, if you are not familiar with this one, you should pick it up. It's not the heaviest album around (although it's still pretty beefy), but Ride the Lightning is an awesome album.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The songs are cleaned up and sound much better not only from a sonic standpoint, but because they are more emotionally immediate. Without all the crap Spector glopped on top of the songs like so much prepackaged gravy, the deceptively simple and beautiful songs are allowed to breathe. The vocals come to the fore, the guitars ring, the drums pound and the band sounds amazingly fresh and vital. I used to think this was a lesser Beatles album, indicative of their decline, dated and somewhat half-assed, I no longer think that way. Naked shows what this album could have been: immediate, emotional and vital. It sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. I like the fact that most of the extraneous chatter has been done away with, it was distracting and unecessary.  However the exclusion of Maggie Mae and Dig It are odd, disapointing and a major flaw.  The stupid decision to edit the material is a huge mistake and so I kicked off two stars from what should have been a 5 star release.
B000002KDO|5.0|Without a doubt, Master of Reality is my favorite Black Sabbath album. I tend to go with this one because it has more of the songs that i like and is more consistent than the other albums. It is also very influential: Within the context of metal, you can hear all where many bands took their ques from. From Sweet Leaf to Into the Void, this one just does not let down. Even the acoustic moments are awesome. Tony Iommi delivers more impressive riffs than some of the band's other works. Simply put this is great music. Master of Reality is really short, but that is ok. The music blazing from this cd is all good. Try it for yourself. You may find yourself liking it as much as I do! If not, then you suck!!! Just Kidding. But regardless, give it a spin. Master of Reality is worth it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|this wasnt as good as hybrid theory because it had 2 much rap. But, This was a cool cd I listen to it now and then and it's just sumthin I like to listen 2. Favorite Track is 5 Hit the Floor it's a cool heavy song and i can play it on the guitar.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I avoided this film for the longest time because Ashton Kutcher was the star of it, but now that I've finally watched it I've discovered that (a) it's a great film and (b) he can actually act!  Yes, the film does dwell into some dark recesses of humanity, but I don't believe it's done so gratuitously.  The Director's Cut with alternate ending is much better than the theatrical version, in my opinion.  That being said, I can see why this ending would not have been very acceptable in theatres.  Either way, you'll find lots to discuss and talk about with friends afterwards.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Yeah i used to like this band but...... now i dont its a little strange i guess but their posers trying to be like other bands by sayin F*** in one of their songs. AND WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING ON THE BEST RECORD COMPANY IN THE WORLD ROADRUNNER RECORDS HUH!!!! It makes me wonder..........
B00005O5CM|5.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" is a great movie with great, albeit predictable, characters.  However, director Robert Luketic found a way to balance a current formula for box office success (pretty, young cast + quick-witted dialogue + feel-good dream achievement) with some subtler messages for the thinking people out there. <br /> <br />For example, as anyone who has taken the LSAT knows, Elle's whole admittance to Harvard Law is a farce.  But, the movie doesn't try to make it realistic.  Instead, Elle gets a forty point LSAT score boost (that would be like doubling your SAT score), somehow garners letters of recommendation, and then sends in a video essay.  Luketic is reminding us to suspend our disbelief, something too often forgotten in an industry sometimes too preoccupied with spectacular special effects. In this development, we see a couple of Luketic's strokes of ingenuity.  First, Elle's parents are not just rote characters like those of the movie--they're the ultimate stock characters, and discourage Elle from attending law school because it is for boring, ugly people.  These characters aren't just for the hyperbole laugh, but seem to be nodding to the audience--\\"yeah, we realize the story line and characters may be familiar to you, but we're not going to bore you here, in fact, have a laugh at our expense.\\"  Then, Elle's video essay also has some interesting satirical elements.  As the admissions committee discusses Elle's application, the frame of the film cuts off part of the television on which Elle's admission video just played.  So, you see an old white dude making a decision for one of the world's most competitive programs with ONLY Elle's bikini-clad body on the screen behind him.  The old men are making a case for her GPA and LSAT scores, but the cut suggests that something less academic may be influencing their decision.  This scene raises several questions: First, should women be allowed to use their sexuality as a weapon when entering male-dominated spheres?Second, how aware is anyone of the factors they may be manipulating to their advantage?  Elle was only behaving as she always had.  And, is there a real difference between Elle's getting in on her swimsuit performance and Warner, as we learn later, getting in on his father's connections?   <br /> <br />This is a great movie to own for its popular entertainment value, the pleasure of watching it more than once, and, if you need an excuse, scholarly excursions like those discussed above.
B0000508U6|5.0|I popped this album in for a listen today and was reminded of how much I enjoy it. I'm not a diehard Coldplay fan, but I own their two more mainstream albums and they are definitely worthy of praise.  <br /> <br />I was driving in the car with my friend Rose the other day and we were listening to A Rush of Blood to the Head... I kept commenting \\"I like this song\\", \\"This is a good song\\", to which she replied, \\"They're all good songs!\\" I think that pretty much sums up the talent level of the band. All of their tracks are of high caliber, unlike much of the music that is hastily recorded and marketed today, as other Amazon reviewers have pointed out. These guys know they have something to say, and they are on a mission to make high-quality music, to prove that there is still high-quality music to be made. Obviously the public has responded favorably to it as well, because I have not read a negative review of Parachutes. Indeed it is soothing music, heartfelt and meaningful music that manages to be deep and reflective without being depressing. It's easy to listen to in virtually any setting - driving in the car, entertaining friends, even falling asleep. Not often is music able to be so successful in such a pleasant manner - even the most angsty of songs on Parachutes are an enjoyable and relaxing listen.  <br /> <br />It is clear how dedicated the band members are to their craft as well; they are not just some fly-by-night pop icons trying to make a quick buck. Just take a minute to watch one of their videos (notably \\"Clocks\\") and you will see how connected they are to their music. <br /> <br />The members of Coldplay, aside from being great musicians, are also successful at being good people. Their efforts to make trade fair and restore rainforest are noble endeavors for anyone to take on, and I especially respect this sort of political responsibility shown by pop artists who are in the spotlight. I'd probably love them for the causes they so humbly support even if their music was horrible. Luckily for us listeners, Coldplay is able to provide the entire package. <br /> <br />
B000002LUB|5.0|But unfortunately it wouldn't go any further than this.  After Dio and Vinny left(coz Tony and Geezer were being schmucks), Sabbath had a revolving door of musicians and singers with varying degrees of success, but nothing compared to the Ozzy/Dio days.  Getting Dio and Vinny back for Dehumanizer was a great move coz it produced the best post-Ozzy Sabbath album.  You may have stared at Dehumanizer in your local used cd store and thought, \\"why are there so many copies here??  Must not be that good\\".  Scratch that thinking quick!  The only folks who sold it are diehard Ozzy fans who were too braindead(like Ozzy) to realize he wasn't on this album, or people who bought it based strictly on Wayne's World.  Dehumanizer is an underrated metal classic.  Sure, it has to stand in the shadow of the band's classic albums, but any band who's career goes on for a few decades will always have to stand in the shadow of their previous works.  Unless you're Aerosmith of course.  And anyone interested in Sabbath will get the classic albums first, that's only natural.  Once you're acquainted though, give this a shot.  It doesn't sound much like Black Sabbath, it sounds quite similar to a Dio album with modifications(he sounds pissed.  Listen to him yell), but I think of it as a rebirth of the band for the nineties.  More albums with this lineup in this direction could have opened the doors for a new generation of fans.  Lots of folks are into Dio and the kind of doomy/power metal on Dehumanizer, so it could have been a good direction for the band.  But because history repeats itself(Tony and Geezer being schmucks), Dio and Vinny said, \\"see ya\\".  Now Black Sabbath seem comfortable doing \\"reunion\\" gigs playing all classic tunes with an Ozzy who can't carry a tune anymore as opposed to new(and good) songs with a decade-older-than-Ozzy Dio who can carry a tune as good as he did 20+ years ago.  You decide what you prefer, but don't let Dehumanizer pass you by.  It's very, very good and it's better to see what could have been than spending the money for another \\"Best of\\" compilation.  It's cheaper too.s better to see what could have been than spending the money for another \\"Best of\\" compilation.  It's cheaper too.
0780020685|5.0|I really wish there were more stars that I could give this movie. Akira Kurosawa's samurai masterpiece is an essential in any classics library. It tells the story of a small farming village who learns it will be the next target for a band of bandits. It is decided that the best thing to do is to hire samuria to help them defend the village. Seven very different warriors are hired to fight the bandits. They include all the samurai archetypes, the old veteran, the young warrior, the master swordsman, the tactician, the one along for a job, the jokester, and a warrior who is not a true samurai. The seven form a bond as they fight and experience great joys and sorrows through the course for the battle with the bandits.  Kurosawa has put together a movie that became the standard that all samurai, and even Amrican westerns are judged by. His use of camera is perfect. Fight scenes are very advanced and physical for the time the movie was shot. The battles are very authentic of the time period and keep the attention of even today's viewer who is used to massive amounts of blood in combat sequences.  This movie was the inspiration for the Western \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". Though this is a fine movie, it cannot hold a candle to Kurosawa's original, which is a thousand times better. It is a true masterpiece of film and deserving of all the praise that it gets. Buy this movie, make some time in the day a watch this classic Japanese film. You will not be dissapointed in the least.    I'm adding this part because there needs to some clarification. A few reviews down one person makes the assertion that Kurosawa doesn't know samurai, portrayed them badly, and the fights in the movie are unrealistic. To that I say, what do you know? Does you reading Bushido make you an expert on the ways of samurai? Fact check time people.   1)Kurosawa clearly knows a lot about samurai. I would think a native of Japan would now something more than someone who read Bushido out of context. The depiction is quite accurate in the movie.  2) Actually I think that the samurai in this movie get a pretty fair shake. Normally they are portrayed as violent, manipulative buearocrats, because thats what they were. There is the idea samurai as described in Bushido, and then there is the reality as men who sometimes abused their authority. The Christian ideal is found in the Bible, but there are people who definetly don't follow what they read.  3) Lastily, I think people's view of samurai action has been manipulated by Hollywood. Movies like The Last Samurai and Zatoichi show samurai as guys who can kill five guys in one attack. That is silly. Kurosawa actually portrayed the warriors in his movie in the most acurate way he could. This was how it actually happened folks! Forget the ideas of the lone warrior taking on fifty guys at once. That's a nice romantic view of the samurai, but the fact is there were very few people like that.  So please watch Seven Samurai for authentic samurai action.
B000002LR3|5.0|This is it, the album where psychedelia, techno and blues rock all blend together in one blissful mix. This is also one of the best albums I've ever heard just for the sheer variety of styles that can be found. Most of the tunes are very trip hop oriented then there are the blues rock flavorings that resemble the Stones at their peak. This was the exact opposite end of the musical spectrum back in the 90's when, in the U.S., the grunge scene was in full swing. In the U.K. this album was a big hit but it didnt make quite that big of a splash over here in the states as we were engrossed in Cobain and company. But this album deserves more attention than it has received, its one of the most original albums I've ever heard, true it may be a mish mash of familiar genres but the way its all put together and heard sounds brand new. Anyways highly reccomended!
B00006JIA4|3.0|The American music-buying public sucks.  Americans only like \\"It's Fun To Smoke Marijuana\\" (a.k.a. \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\") and the dumb song that was on Wayne's World.  Try digging deeper and discovering songs that AREN'T popular.  Just because a song is popular (i.e. on the radio), doesn't mean that non-hits can't be just as good, if not better.  As far as this collection goes, it's a good introduction (I suppose) for the money.  But if you like it, then go out and buy the ALBUMS.
B00026YO36|5.0|Mark Lanegan sings like he means every single solitary syllable. The new CD, Bubblegum is like buying an E ticket to the best sideshow you are ever going to experience. <br />The lyrics are as deep as the deepest coal mine on the planet. Each song tells a story and if you take the time the tales he tells are often so real they hurt.  Most of the stories are troubled and true. With every solo work Lanegan has produced you get the feeling that you are looking, feeling and hearing things that are on a truely personal level. Drug addiction, worry, death, trying, failing, hope, fear, love... you name it and Lanegan can piece together a tale that will bring you in, sit you down, and  make you understand. Bubblegum is no exception.  He truly has a gift. That is why I have every Lanegan solo,album and every Screaming Trees lp(yes...lp's) since Clairvoyance. I have seen the Screaming Trees live.  It was a sight. Intense.  I saw QOTSA (Kyuss was ok) but I went to see Lanegan. Daisy Theatre in Memphis, Tenn.  When Lanegan came on stage the temperature and mood in the room changed! He has that ability. The people in the audience who had been rocking to QOTSA took a step back and then eased forward looking at each other and thinking \\"What is this\\"? The side conversations stopped, people payed attention.  Lanegan held on to the mike stand with both hands like it was the last solid object on the earth and let fly. One of the best damn singer/songwriters ever!
B00003CXCT|1.0|What about the scene in TESB after the sabre battle where Luke declines Vader's offer to, um, join him for some familial dark side ruling, and falls from his perch into the depths of Cloud City.  As I recall from the original version, Luke made not a whimper, making it a memorable act of defiance.  Sadly, the special edition edits in an unintentionally hilarious scream, rendering Luke into what sounds like a chug-a-lug taking his first bungee jump.  Just as 'Greedo Shoots First' robs Han Solo's character of valuable shading, the 'scream' robs Luke of his heroic grandeur.  Kiddies don't seem to understand the value of this--the value of strong characterizations and dramatic subtext--preferring instead to ramble on about the pretty but meaningless add-on visuals and SFX--more opium for the gaming generation.  Consider these special editions alongside the useless remakes of other important 70's films, likewise robbed of their mature underpinnings and societal context for the continued ogling of the increasingly unrelatable and uninspired movie-going public. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|The lates avenged sevenfold cd is getting really popular.  For some like myself it didnt lived up to the expectations.  Its a good cd and if you like black metal pick it up.  But i dont see the HUGE deal about it.  But nonetheless its a good cd.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|It's been a while since I've seen Robocop, so I picked up this DVD set. <BR>Robocop 1 is such a great movie! Watching it now is a lot better than it was when I watched it as a teenager. It was great back then, but there was so much that I didn't pick up. Watching it now from a man's prospective is a totally different experience. <br />The version of Robocop 1 in this set is the &quot;un-rated&quot; version. I would definitely keep it away from children. Some of the scenes are a lot more gory and grusome than they were in the &quot;R&quot; rated version (A LOT MORE!) and on it's own, this version is hard to find.  Robocop 3, on the other hand, is more family oriented and only rated PG-13. The violence from the previous movies has been toned down quite a bit and there is no use of the &quot;F&quot; bomb. It's a nice movie, but it does not have the same feel of the other two(or actor. Peter Weller chose not to return.)<br />These movies have aged well because they were ahead of there time when they came out. A great DVD set and a purchase that I don't regret!
B00000AFFF|4.0|This is such a good album.  I've been looking through all the reviews, and see that it has received some 1 and 2 star ratings.  I actually didn't dig it the first two or three plays through.  I think it's an acquired taste, really.  Long story short; try to listen to it more than once, you might be surprised.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is the third release from this Virginia based band, fourth if you count Burn The Priest. Personally, I find it to be the weakest of the three cd's they have put out, but it is still better than anything else that's out right now. This group is head and shoulders above everyone in the biz right now. This cd contains the same crushing riffs that made NAG and ATPB so great. The Drums and Bass are in your face which is a change from their previous releases and credited to Machine, who got lucky enough to work with these guys. The vocals are really close to ATPB, maybe even a little more clear, and the lyrics are very strong on this effort. The only problem I have with this cd is that while there is a decent amount of breakdowns on this cd, they are not near as brutal as what they were on NAG and ATPB. Standouts on this cd for me are: Laid To Rest, The Faded Line, One Gun, Break You, What Ive Become, and Remorse Is For The Dead. Overall this is a very good cd and I highly recommend this cd for anyone who likes good old fashioned metal. <br />Please support bands like this by purchasing their cd's and watching them live. We need to keep bands like this around.  <br />Buy anything by Lamb Of God and pick up the Burn The Priest re-issue due out 12-21-04. By the way, I'm glad the slipknot fans like this one. Were the first 2 cd's they have out too heavy for you or was it because they didn't hit it big on MTV?
B00005Y84D|5.0|I WAS VERY VERY LUCKY TO FIND THIS DVD OF THIS CONCERT. I LOOKED ON AMAZON QUITE AWHILE BACK AND COULDN'T FIND IT AND TRYED TO FIND IT IN STORE'S ALL OVER TOWN BUT NO LUCK. I WAS SURE I'D FIND IT IN THE MOST POPULAR MERCHANT OR DISCOUNT STORES, BUT SADLY FOUND OUT I WAS WRONG. I EVEN TRIED TO ORDER IT IN SEVERAL LOCATION'S INCLUDING A POPULAR BOOK STORE AND THEY SAID THEY OWN AMAZON.COM BUT TOLD ME IT WAS OUT OF PRINT AND RECENTLY FOUND IT ON AMAZON.COM BUT IT SAID IT WAS ALSO \\"OUT OF PRINT \\" BUT HAD A LINK TO BUYING IT \\" NEW OR USED SO I LOOKED AND FOUND WHERE TO ORDER IT FROM AND DID. I COULDN'T BE MORE HAPPY, I FIRST SAW IT AT THE MOVIE THEATRE MANY, MANY YEARS AGO WHEN IT CAME OUT AND WAS QUITE SURPRIZED TO FIND THAT THIS DVD WAS EXACTLY AS I REMEMBERED IT, \\"EXACTLY\\". THE PICTURE WAS EXCELLANT AND THE AUDIO WAS FLAWLESS. I LOVE THIS DVD AND ANY TRUE FAN OF GEORGE AND/OR THE BEATLES NEEDS TO ADD THIS TO THEIR BEATLES COLLECTION THEY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SLIGHTEST IN MY OPINION OF COURSE, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH! IF ANYONE DOWNGRADES THIS DVD THEY ARE DEFINATELY NOT A DEVOTED OR REAL TRUE BEATLES FAN OR THEY WOULD SHUT UP,  THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST BEATLES DVD OR BETTER YET, BEST OF ALL MY CONCERT DVD'S. YOU MUST BUY IT, BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION
B00005JMUA|4.0|KB1 was rather silly [but in the name of satire, etc., etc], but 2 was well done. Lucky for Quint he chopped this flic in two. One was \\"I can do this 'cause I'm a famous director\\", but two was the dang movie. A proper mix of pretty good story with cool chop-chop. Those who followed Kung-Fu into the 2nd season pilot would love the ending (includes me, obviously).<br /><br />I= kinda silly<br /><br />II= cool<br /><br />See it.<br /><br />Tejas
B00008H2LB|5.0|The album, \\"Meteora\\", by Linkin Park is one of the best I have ever listened to.  Everytime I hear one of these songs I crank it up.  Their previous CD \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was also a great album.  \\"Meteora\\" was a wonderful follow-up of Hybrid.  However, their CD \\"Reanimation\\" was a good hip-hop remix, but scared me because I thought Linkin Park was heading in a more hip-hop direction.  My fears soon went away when they released \\"Meteora\\", because they came up with a hard hitting album. <br /> <br />There is not a bad song on \\"Meteora\\".  The songs that stick out from the rest are Faint and Somewhere I Belong.  They are well build songs and are played over and over on the radio.  They are almost played too much and can be heard on almost any type of station.  But, the song Lying From You really kicks it out and is my favorite song on this album.  I like this song a lot, because it is not repeted on the air as much as the other songs and is a more powerful song then the rest. <br /> <br />Their guitarist has been very consistent in his playing, while coming up with new exciting riffs.  Their singer, Chester, has a twisted and unique sound.  Linkin Parks rap artist really knows how to blend the rock and the rap in a hardcore way.   <br /> <br />Linkin Park have come up with some new sounds and some interesting beats with their deep band.  I see them going in a positive direction into the future of rock.  I love this album.  I still love the previous one.  If you do not like Linkin Parks suond, you will not like this CD.  But, I strongly recommend it. <br /> <br />
B00008EY65|3.0|Wednesday, September 08, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Fair comic translation.<br /><br />Not a bad comic book translation, Hellboy starts off very well with a flashback to WWII and the Nazi's attempts to open a gateway to bring back ageless demon gods.  Nice Lovecraft stuff sure, but additionally we get an interestingly compelling villain in the silent decaying assassin who dons various gas masks and wields knives in effective ninja style.  The demon Hellboy squirts through the portal before the allies close it and is raised by an old looking John Hurt.  Flash forward and the main antagonists are again at it in the 2000's, Hellboy in adolescence is joined by other paranormal fighters and must stop them.  The makeup on Perlman is pretty good and the CG effects aren't too bad.  It's not too engrossing but it was a pleasant time killer.
B0001LJC2K|2.0|I'm not going to make any comparisons to Radiohead because I honestly don't think they sound the same.  Matt sounding like Thom is a different story though, but I'm not going to get into that either.    I think this is the worst Muse album to date because after six years they still latch on to the exact same sound.  It seems to me like Muse wrote about 50 songs in one year and is periodically releasing them claiming that it is \\"new\\" material.  I honestly see very little difference in style, mood, or theme from thier very first release.  You can change the riffs and the lyrics but the structure and mood remain the same.  Matt, we know you can use falsetto, cut it out!  Songs like \\"The Small Print\\" and \\"Stockholm Syndrom\\" are just revamped versions of older tracks.  The many softer tracks on the album are very haunting as well.  Not haunting like something that stays with you always, haunting like, \\"Mister, Mister!  GET ME OUTTA HERE!\\"  I think I actually got physically ill from listening to this album all the way through.  It's really a bombardment on the senses.  Most of my pain and anguish came from the fear that this album would never end.  The similarities between the tracks made me think it was a really long song.    Newcomers may enjoy this album, being unfamiliar with Muse's catalog of material.  I don't recommend this album compared to others.  I actually wouldn't recommend any album other than the first because that's the only one that isn't recycled material.  The production on here was probably the thing that I disliked the most.  It really made the tracks more focused and polished.  So instead of getting hit in the face with a spotlight it's like getting hit in the face with a laser.  I prefer the old style that was a bit more uninhibited and raw, but even those days were riddled with the same lack of creativity.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I was poking around on Amazon, and noticed this CD, so I demoed it. It sounded really nice, so I purchased it at Sam Goody a few days later. The short, low-quality demo sure as heck didn't do justice to the full tracks, which are elegant, haunting, and beautiful.<br /><br />Of the ten songs on this CD, I liked most of them quite well. Near the end of the CD, I wasn't too fond of Another Day, Alpha Beta Gaga, or Biological, but the other songs (Venus, Run, Universal Traveller, Mike Mills, Surfing On A Rocket, and Alone In Kyoto) more than make up for those three mediocre songs.<br /><br />A great CD to listen to on a rainy afternoon, curled up with a nice novel.
0783240236|5.0|Suzanne Pleshette lays back on her couch listening to Tippi Hedren flirt with her long-ago flame, Rod Taylor, on the phone. After playing hard to get Tippi Hedren agrees to stay the  next day. Suzanne Pleshette rolls her eyes and tilts her head away from the camera...striking exactly the same pose she is in when she is found dead on her front stairs near the end of the movie.   The birds sure didn't kill her. That image of her dead is one of the most striking things in the film because you've seen it before. The connection is so subtle that you only make the connection after repeated viewings. Only Hitchcock could pull something like that off so beautifully. He really was a genius.
0316776963|4.0|I had never been able to laugh out loud in a book until I discovered David Sedaris.  I am happy to say that I think this is the best book of his that I have read and on many occassions I was in hysterics.<br /><br />He has such a way of relaying what everyone else thinks.<br /><br />Read this book!
B00028HBKM|1.0|This film is every hammy old Hollywood biblical movie cliche done up in a gimmicky MTV/fashion photography/music video style. For all of Gibson's  much discussed devotion, he delivers a Jesus that seems remote, and detatched without a trace of kindness. The violence was hyped and not nearly as graphic as I expected, and it was presented in such an overly art-directed fashion that is was rendered meaningless (the bloody floor after the scourging scene was so elegantly styled and photographed that it held no horror or impact). Gibson's Jesus suffered so stoically that his ordeal seemed more an inconvenience than sacrifice. In fact all of the characters seemed stripped of any humanity and emotion. At least the Bowie-esque Satan and T. Rex-like Herod added some glam rock camp to the proceedings (maybe Lou Reed should have played Pilate). As a fan of Roman history and considering Mr. Gibson's  beliefs I was expecting to find the film overly pious. I wasn't expecting a film so overblown, bloated and silly (what was that werewolf that growled at Judas, and the demon baby that looked like Uncle Fester?).    Shallow, self-indulgent, and murky to the point of meaningless, this film would have had a hard time making it into theatrical release without the Mel Gibson-fueled contoversies.
B00000IMTF|5.0|Sure you can say that Stargazer is a Led Zeppelin \\"rip-off\\", but it really sounds a lot better than Zep's original tune. (sure! with better lyrics, drummer, vocalist and of course, guitar player, this is quite obvious.) <br />Oh, and talking 'bout \\"rip-offs\\".. where do you think Page got the idea of doing that \\"indian tones\\" like in kashmir? It was a Rip-off of his all time hero, John Maclaughlin (Mahavishnu orchestra)  <br />Fantastic album! Just great songs, all of them!
B00004WKII|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box-Set inlcudes outtakes, live recordings, and alternate recordings. This entire box-set is unreleased music spanning through 67-70. This is truely a must have for Jimi Hendrix collectors including a great 80 page booklet, and over 46 unreleased recordings. The live performences are great as well on all four disc's including on disc one Like A Rolling Stone, disc two Burning Of The Midnight Light, disc three Voodoo Chile(slight return), disc four All Along The Watchtower. The sound quality is the best part about this box-set all remastered by Eddie Kramer from Electric Ladyland studio. You cant go wrong with a great box-set including mostly unreleased recordings, and unreleased live recordings. Enjoy! ~
0393035158|5.0|The reivew from \\"Reader\\" of Maryland, USA, is grossly misinformed about the history of religion. <br /> <br />Religion did not end slavery, it abetted slavery. Religion did not push scientific acheivement, it hindered it.  <br /> <br />Regarding slavery, here are a few quotes to back up my assertion: <br /> <br />\\"I am unaware of any religion in the world which in the past forbade slavery. The professors of Christianity for ages supported it; the Old Testament repeatedly sanctioned it by special laws; the New Testament has no repealing declaration. <br /> <br />It is scarcely a quarter of a century since the famous emancipation amendment was carried to the United States Constitution; and it is impossible for any well-informed Christian to deny that the abolition movement in North America was most steadily and bitterly opposed by the religious bodies in the various States. Henry Wilson, in his Rise and Fall of the Slave-Power in America; Samuel J. May, in his Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict, and J. Greenleaf Whittier, in his poems, alike are witnesses that the Bible and pulpit, the church and its great influence, were used against abolition and in favor of the slaveowner. <br /> <br />[Speaking of Europe's recent abolition of slavery] <br />The heretic Condorcet pleaded powerfully for freedom, whilst Christian France was still slave-holding. For many centuries Christian Spain and Christian Portugal held slaves... It is a Christian King, Charles V., and a Christian friar, who founded in Spanish America the slave-trade between the Old World and the New. For some 1,800 years almost all Christians kept slaves, bought slaves, sold slaves, bred slaves, and stole slaves.  Pious Bristol and godly Liverpool, less than one hundred years ago, openly grow rich on the traffic. During the ninth century Greek Christians sold slaves to the Saracens. In the eleventh century prostitutes were publicly sold in Rome as slaves, and the profit went to the church.\\" <br />-CharlesBradlaugh, Humanity's Gain From Unbelief, 1889 <br /> <br />\\"There is not one verse in the Bible inhibiting slavery, but <br />many regulating it. It is not then, we conclude, immoral.\\" <br />-Rev. Alexander Campbell <br /> <br />And regarding scientific progress, the Chruch imprisoned Gallileo for asserting that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The Church fights against evolutionary theory and pushes for creationism to be taught in classrooms. And in 1993, Saudi Arabia declared the Earth was flat, and anyone who states otherwise is an atheist and infidel that deserves to be punished.  <br /> <br />\\"Reader\\" from Maryland, I hope you educate yourself more on history and religion before making such unsupported and patently false claims.
B000002KHB|5.0|Forget about Led Zeppelin IV, Black Sabbath's Paranoid and all the others! This album is THE classic rock album of the 70's!( and of all time)  <br />Great songs from the first one to the last(( except maybe for \\"Never Before\\" that is just good) <br />If you're looking for real guitar playing this is a must have! one of the most influential guitar players of all time( just ask all the 80's shredding kiddos, like Yngwie Malmsteen, Van Halen and Randy Rhoads......)  at his best <br /> <br />ps: I really think the original version is better than the remastered one
B0002S94OS|3.0|When I heard the songs off the LOG I felt something was lacking. The music was pretty much straight forward but it made me feel like I was listening to New American Gospel again and I hated that album.  At least Blythe's voice did improve from that album for ATPB and AOTW.  I really think they need to bring Devin back to producing for them.  I felt that ATPB had more of a wall of sound.  You could hear weird background stuff added in and almost gave LOG an industrial deathmetal tinge.  I don't really find any of that on this album.  Please guys go back and get Devin I think he really improved the band on ATPB.  They really need him again.
B000002J09|2.0|I always loved Led zeppelin, but when I heard Deep purple's Machine Head, I lost my interest in Jimmy Page's playing and his band.. <br />If you want a GOOD Zep album, buy their second one, but if you're a looking for a REAL classic.. try Deep Purple's Machine Head, In Rock and Burn, Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, or Black Sabbath's Paranoid or Heaven and Hell
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm an American service man stationed over seas, so I had to watch this movie in bootleg form. I have read many of the \\"Republican\\" reviews of Mr. Moore's film, down playing it as all lies. As a registered republican myself, I thought there was some truth to those reviews. I watch this movie with an open mind. All I can say is I am ashamed of my commander and chief. If even half of the movie is true Bush and Chainny should be brought up on criminal charges. I'm not all warm and fuzzy over Kerry, but hell I'll take satin over Bush right now. I think every one should see this movie for them selves and make up there own minds. Even if you think this film is a pack of lies you should see it, just to consider if it rises any questions or doubts in your mind. It did for me.<br /><br />And for god's sake go out and vote!
B0002TT0NM|3.0|The past 2 Harry Potter books have been small enough that all the important information was presented in those movies. I was dumb struck throughout this movie. The last straw was the broomstick (no pun intended) given at the end, 1/3 of the book was about the mysterious broomstick. I was horribly disappointed in the whole movie. Time was wasted panoraming around the land scape when it could have been used for dialog that was sorely needed. Even though I read the book I was lost 1/2 way through. Especially the time travel of Hermoine. The one good thing that can be stated, Professor Trelawny (Emma Thompson), brilliant. Please make the next couple of movies at least longer or into 2 movies. Another critic suggested spring for one and Fall for the other. That sounds great to me also. I gave it 3 stars because that's the lowest score I will give a Harry Potter movie. The first two definitely 5 stars.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This was a fantastic movie! It brought out the best in European humour and style of cinematography. It's quirky, thoughtful, provocative and crazy all at the same time. The protagonist, Xavier, is comprehensible by most and his experience as an exchange student comes across as believeable. I really enjoyed the many shots of Barcelona: Maremagnum, Barceloneta, Placa Catalunya and many more. Having spent part of my summer in Barcelona earlier this year the film was like a return to the crazy party atmosphere I experienced. A melting-pot of cultures. I totally reccomend it!
B0002IQHY8|5.0|A Valid Path is the first Alan Parsons album of the 21st centruy. Highlights include \\"Return to Tunguska\\" and \\"We Play the Game\\" -- personal favorites and among the artist's best works ever. The music has a timeless feel, a characteristic of all Alan Parsons albums. Listening to the electronica themes on AVP, it's hard to suspect the material was produced by a \\"classic, progressive rock\\" artist.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay writes the most original and genuine lyrics I have heard lately. They are without a doubt some of the most talented artists of this era in music. This cd displays a good deal of their best work especially the laced-with-euphoria \\"Shiver\\" which I would be couragous enough to call my favorite song, a title which does not come easily. If you are considering buy this cd, or any of Coldplay works for that matter I would do so. They may be the best additions to your media collection in some time.
B000002J1L|4.0|Yes! There are all classic Genesis members(1971-1975) in this album!  Gabriel sings and plays flute, Banks is harmonist, Rutherford is basist, Collins plays drums and Hackett plays quitar. Teamwork is a powerful machine that these men uses very well. Group compositions are skillfully made and Gabriel has a very sharp and creative pen when he writes lyrics.<br /><br />  There are eight songs on this album:<br /><br /> 1.The Musical Box is a classic song in which contais many interesting and good parts especially Banks's harmon solo.<br /><br /> 2.For Absent Friends is a beautiful ballad<br /><br /> 3.The Return of The Giant Hogweed reveals Collins drum playing skills at the end of the track. Lyrics are the real evidence for Gabriel's great imagination<br /><br /> 4. Seven Stones is a nice sea story about captain on the storm.<br /><br />  Chorus is my favourite part!<br /><br />5. Harold the Barrel tells a funny tragedy.<br /><br />8. Unfornately, Harlequin is one of the weakest classic Genesis songs because composition is so poor.<br /><br />9. The Fountain of Salmacis has a very good quitar sections and story is extraordinary<br /><br /> Highly recommanded for Genesis and proge fans!
0784011710|5.0|I read the book the moment it hit the stands because I was already a huge William Styron fan. I had a first edition! (Then I lent it to someone, and oh well, we all know the end of that story.) I just about reached a moment of person ecstacy (nice way to put it , eh?)when I heard Meryl Streep was chosen to play Sophie.(My other mental choice was Faye Dunaway - Meryl is better, no question.)<br />And when I saw the movie, like the book they kept peeling away layer after layer of her story until in the end we 'know' her truth. I have it on DVD and watch at least once a year. It reaches me, it scares me, it touches my soft places and hardens my defensive ones. It makes me question how the character survives at all, instead of just having a psychotic break in the camp (which would have been certain death).<br />It is perhaps the most horrible of horror movies where it is<BR>horrific, and the most touching of character pieces where Sophie<BR>is &quot;made to bloom like a rose&quot; in her humour, her humanity, and her regained health. It makes me laugh at all of Sophie's gentle and telling abuses of the language as she translates in her head and then speaks in a rather tortured eegnleesh. And it is also a remarkable movie for the sensitivity and strength of the three lead performances (Kevin Kline's debut!). Alan Pakula adapted and directed in a masterful sweep : history of the very large, and the very small. If he had never made another movie, this would be enough (but of course he did make others).<br />It is hard to convince people (especially mothers) that they will<BR>enjoy the book or the film, because they all aready think they know what &quot;Sophie's choice&quot; is....but the point is that Sophie makes choices on many levels throughout the film - all of which promise salvation of a sort, and deliver something quite different. It is a tragedy in all too human terms, because in all liklihood, it is NOT fiction. At a certain, high school age, this is the movie that students should watch when they start asking why there was a Second World War, and what evil lurks in the hearts of men, and why is there an Israel?<br />If you have been thinking of renting it, or buying it, or reading it, I strongly recommend opening yourself to the experience. You will be richly rewarded and 'touched' everywhere.<br />&quot;.....and I knew that only a Jesus who no longer cared for me could take all of these peoples, that I did loved so much, away from me and leaving me here.........alive.&quot;<br />&quot;The truth. The truth the truth. I do not know anymore what is the truth. After all of these lies that I have told.......You want to know the truth?&quot;<br />Haunting.
B000002NZO|4.0|Tresspass is not easy listening album!<br /><br /> There is no hits!<br /><br /> This is not one of the critics classic Genesis albums!<br /><br /> But....  Tresspass has its own pros(ans cons)<br /><br /> Looking For Someone, White Mountain and Visions of Angels are force trio. These tracks contains many specific musical details for example. White Mountain's choir ending and Looking For Someone's terrific middle parts including mellotron and flute.<br /><br /> Stagnation has just right name because this song sounds perfectly like it. This not favourite part at this album but it is ok. Otherwise, Dusk is something that Genesis would have cut off for this album and would have chosen some other song. The final track called The Knife is one the greatest songs that Genesis have ever made. This nine minute song has all Genesis specialities for exemple. excelent guitar solo, outstanding harmon part, intresting lyrics and good drums.<br /><br /> It takes some time to find Tresspass' word but it's worth of listening!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I really think Britney Spears, \\"Me Against the Music\\" was one of her worst songs yet. I love Britney to death but I was very disapointed with the song. It portrayed her as this lonely girl trying to fight the music industry, which she pretty much owns herself anyway, so it seemed fake, and basically thrown together, so to speak, and the video really doesn't portray the song as most of her videos do. The song got really old fast, to me, and it wasn't even really overplayed! The minute the song starts, I cringe, and think of how terrible it is. I think of an 80's workout video when I hear it! Madonna, who is the oppisite of Britney in the video, plays a cat and mouse game around the dirty, old nightclub, that the viewers may not quite understand. There is also a little implied lesbianism in it, which I am sure no one will complain about. The \\"posse\\" that is dancing behind Britney throughout the song is very good, but then there is Madonna, who is rolling around bed frames, and grinding walls in a yoga like manner, or it could very possibly be some sort of \\"Kabbalah\\" ritual. Finally, Britney pins Madonna against the wall and leans in for a kiss when Madonna disappears with laughter. I really don't know what it is about the song, but I am just so sick of its whole entire concept! I think her whole album, \\"In the Zone\\" is amazing, except for this song, which also has a remix. (#13 on the CD) I really don't think we need to hear two versions of it. One is quite enough for me, but who am I to talk? I am just a simple-minded review writer here. There are probably handfuls of people out there who love the song, and I pity you! Did I mention I hate this song? Britney, c'mon and get some new songs already!!
B00006879E|5.0|Along with popular belief, Maroon 5 is a band worth the cover charge. Lead singer Adam Levine is a lyrical genius. Making listeners wanting more and more. Maroon 5's songs captivate people of all generations. They are a band for all to enjoy. Even my 45 year old mom likes them. <br />    Maroon 5 is not your typical pop band, or the way over done boy band. Maroon 5 integreates excellent lyrics with awsome beats. Their lyrics are more than just skin deep. You feel as if you were going through what the singer is going through. Anyone who enjoys a good love song will love Maroon 5. But don't worry there not all about love songs, there are a few break up songs mixed in as well. With all the junk on the radio and toping billboard charts, take a break and listen to Maroon 5. You won't be dissapointed. <br />    I would reccomend Maroon 5 to anyone and everyone. So go out and buy their double platinum album Songs about Jane. Trust me two million people can't be wrong.
B0000Y3TD6|2.0|To tell you the absolute truth, I love Britney Spears, but this would have to be the worst song I've heard yet. The song just annoys me for some reason. It portrays her as this lonely girl trying to fight the music industry, which she pretty much almost owns herself anyway, but I just hate the whole aspect of the song and video. The song seems thrown together, so to speak, and the video didn't really portray the song as most of her videos do. The song also got very old fast, even though it wasn't even overplayed!

1591840562|5.0|This is a truly great book.  I didn't expect to get so much from it; I'm battle-hardened myself and thought I knew a lot about starting companies and thinking about product development and marketing. I'm an author myself, of two technical books (you can search for me in Amazon's author index) so I understand the process and am have pretty high standards in reading and judging books. <br /> <br />I've read the first 20 pages of a lot of supposedly similar books and given up on them. Time, after all, is one of the most valuable assets to an entrepreneur, and I won't have mine wasted. But with The Art of the Start I was learning and thinking on every page, and genuinely got excited about my own business by reading this book; it doesn't get much better than that. <br /> <br />Guy Kawasaki has a gift for getting right to the heart of an issue, in a no-nonsense way, which of course every entrpreneur needs; I'm often thinking: make your point already! <br /> <br />And right when you're about to call into question one of the points the author is making (and he does make some bold points that you're tempted to question) he follows it immediately with \\"for example...\\" and the examples are so compelling and clear, you immediately accede his point, change your own thinking slightly, and keep reading. <br /> <br />I wrote Guy Kawasaki a long email while I was on an airplane and had been reading this book, to tell him that I loved it. I normally would never do such a thing, but he points out in the book that you should always include your email address and not hide from customers, and you should answer your email, so it occurred to me that it might be okay to write to him.  So I did, and he wrote back to thank me. <br /> <br />I've read a lot of \\"how-to\\" books on a lot of topics, from woodworking to business development, and this is one of the best ever written.  I'm not sure if my review will compell you to check it out, but I thought it's worth a try.  I am not one who normallyrecommends things, so my recommendation carries extra weight. <br /> <br />Get it.  Read it.
B0000027I6|5.0|This is by far my favorite rock album. Oh, what the hell? It's my favorite album period, and it should be everyone else's favorite album too. This is also the ultimate concept album. If you've never heard it, give it a listen and you'll see what I mean.  <br /> <br />It's just too damn bad that the critics didn't feel the same way. But, who really gives a damn what the critics say anyway, am I right? Critics are by and large a very bitter, frustrated, and depressed group of people who tend to make their jealousy of talented artists extremely obvious with their caustic, unfair, and ignorant reviews. I've never understood why any of these scumbags get paid so much money to piss and moan and groan about things when there are already millions of people on this miserable planet who do the exact same thing for free ... but I digress. <br /> <br />I will say this, it's a shame that this couldn't have been a Pink Floyd album instead of a solo work by Waters. It might have sold more copies, and gotten considerably more air play, but you can't have everything.  <br /> <br />My advice to the novice Pink Floyd/Roger Waters fan: Ignore the critics. They'll steer you wrong every time. <br /> <br />Uncle Floyd
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Today's female artists are very similar. They all have the same background music, they have the same beat and so on. Alicia Keys has gone against that and proven that she can sing, write her own music, and is an extraordinary pianist. All of these combined are what keep her fans coming back for more. Alicia Keys has done that with this 2003 album - The Diary of Alicia Keys. She's one of the best to combine a jazzy, R&B, hip hop, blues piano with a soulful voice. With one of her biggest hits; \\"You Don't Know my Name\\", giving you a taste of what she can do with her voice and every other talent she has. With every piece she creates you can expect to have strong lyrics with expression of her life experiences.
B00005U8EM|4.0|Definately a movie worth seeing over and over again.  Bill Murray is funnier than ever. And with a great supporting cast this movie definately takes off to new heights.
0783225792|4.0|Martin Scorsese's film about the mob in Vegas is just as much a general documentary as it is the more specific story of Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, the man with a head for numbers whom the mafia made manager of a casino from which they were skimming millions of dollars.    The level of detail is amazing.  You get totally immersed in Las Vegas life, both the rich and gilded side, and the depraved underbelly.  You also get a lot of detail about what the mob operations were like and how a casino works on the inside, from the level of dealer to the level of management.    Robert De Niro is great as Sam Rothstein; his performance is wonderfully understated and controlled.  You can just see him age onscreen throughout the movie, as more and more pressure piles on his shoulders and he gets obsessed with his job and he meets with devastating betrayal from people whom he allowed himself to trust.    And Sharon Stone...  wow.  I've never seen her act better than in this movie.  What a performance as Ginger, the high-class call girl who captures Sam's heart.  She's gorgeous, greedy, volatile and surprisingly vulnerable at certain points; you can tell that this is a role that Stone completely gave herself up to (and I'm sure Scorsese helped bring out all that devastating energy and emotion).    As for Joe Pesci, his character is kind of a repeat from Goodfellas.  He's violent, has a horrible temper, curses a blue streak, and gets himself involved with people who are just as low as he is.  He's a loose cannon, and not a good person to have around despite the fact that he's Sam's best friend.    In all, a really absorbing and powerful film, though I wish the Pesci character had been a little different than what he is in Goodfellas.  Also, be forewarned, there are some really graphic violent scenes in this film.  I mean, really sick stuff (but you can usually see it coming).
1878424319|1.0|What we know about about the Toltecs comes from the writings of the King of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl, whose work was miraculously saved from the Spanish fires due to the influence his descendents had with the Spanish, having collaborated with them in the defeat of that Aztecs. Nezahualcoyotl said that the Toltecs had dissapeared already, and their disappearance was some 200 years before the arrival of the Spanish, so that means this took place about 700 years ago. So, in order to accept the basic premise of this guy that he is a \\"Toltec shaman\\", we have to throw the facts right out the window. Where, in Mexico, I would like to know, do these \\"Toltecs\\" live? Do they have a reservation, maybe? How about a language that they speak? Is this like \\"Lost World\\" or Shangri-La, maybe? SO remote that explorers haven't even found it yet? Hello?!
6304913176|3.0|Let me start this by identifying myself as a serious Heinlein fan - that's where I'm coming from. <br /> <br />This movie is not an adaptation of the novel - it's a satire/rebuttal of it.  In this movie, Paul Verhoeven sneers at everything that Heinlein glorified, and he's not subtle at all about it.  The heavy-handed \\"military and war are bad\\" theme does make it very hard to suspend disbelief for more than a few minutes at a time. <br /> <br />That said, if you're looking for mindless entertainment, with plenty of action, nudity, sex, gore, and some pretty fair acting, it's not a bad ride - as much as I object to the message, the movie is still fun to watch.  The sets and props are slick, the effects done well, and the actors do a fine job of exploring the characters, no matter how absurd the situations  and motivations get.
B00028HBKM|4.0|ok. for the movie it self i give it five stars, but as far as special features go. there is absolutely NOTHING&#62; nothing at all. no behind the scenes, nothing not even a trailer. but as far as the movie goes its great, its uplifting. it shows you what JESUS realyl went through. and what he did for us, and how much HE suffered, yet people still reject him , i suggest everyone watch it. and as far as &#34;anti-semitism&#34; goes, thats the biggest load of crap i have ever heard LOL.  read the BIBLE and you will find out everything the JEws had said and then some were recorded accuratley into the movie. the truth hurts. not anti semitic. just fact. if thats antim semitic then silence of the lambs is anti-caucasian, and candyman is anti-african american. dont be dumb. buy the movie.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|There is not one thing unique about this cd at all. I cant believe people are calling this there favorite cd ever. If you want to know who Franz Ferdinand stole there sound from listen to some Led Zeppelin. And if you want some good indie rock get Modest Mouse The Lonesome Crowded West. (Trust me its not anything like Float on). <br />
B00029NMRM|2.0|I really enjoyed The Whole Nine Yards, but this sequel was a letdown, not to mention unnecessary in the first place. There's a few worthwhile moments, but overall the movie screams \\"money grab\\". The various head games Bruce Willis plays was funny in the original, but feels sorta recycled here. It might be worth checking out if you come across it while channel surfing, but otherwise you should probably save your cash for something else...
B0002I831S|3.0|I'm guessing few people want to read another opinion about the show. If you do, skip this review. Instead, I'll share my opinion and rating of this DVD collection from a physical product standpoint, as well as some of the DVD-collection/presentation elements. <br /> <br />PHYSICAL PRODUCTION <br />PROS: <br />- comes in a single hard shell case instead of a cardboard fold-out box <br />- each disc label has a photo of an original cast member as their character <br />CONS: <br />- each of the 8 DVDs is stored on a single, clear plastic, uncovered disc-holder. All 8 are held together with a piece of clear tape. <br />- the taped bundle of 8 discs fits inside a tight-fitting paper sleeve <br />- booklet for the DVDs is just a flimsy long fold-out with little informative value <br /> <br /> <br />DVD PRESENTATION: <br />PROS: <br />- good sound <br />- decent image quality <br />- episode preview trailer included for each episode <br />- some episodes have text pop-up commentary <br />- all episodes have chapter logs <br />- original broadcast date included <br />- a few extras included <br />CONS: <br />- being forced to sit through the credits of every episode <br />- being forced to sit through the bridge animation sequence to get to the main menu <br />- bad quality control process on some of episode selection/nav console sequence (for example, I always experience stuttering and visual errors when loading the episode nav console for \\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\\") <br />- use of prints apparently remastered in 1978 (unless the closing copyright date is simply a studio copyright and not print-related). <br /> <br />OTHER STUFF: <br />Price: I bought it new and discounted at $79.99 and thought that should have been the *list* price. Pretty poor value if you pay much more than this.
B00005M91K|5.0|It's gorgeous and profound. How many movies can you describe like that? Most viewers may be thrown by the lack of an obvious narrative, so I recommend watching it not as a movie, but as a dynamic gallery of incredible photography. Sit back and enjoy.
0385504209|5.0|After reading The DaVinci Code, I find it to be fantastic for what it is-an entertaining novel.<br /><br />The book's main character is Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor/expert in symbology who is trying to solve a murder using his knowledge of symbols and puzzles.  Although this sounds implausible at first, Dan Brown does a good job of establishing a logical progression.  The prose is simple and easy to follow, and since every chapter ends in a cliffhanger, it is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Some issues to be warned about-the plot of the book involves the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei movement.  Although Brown does not implicate the Church in evil activities, many critics knock the book for blurring the line between fact and terrific fiction.<br /><br />Second, the book is written in a simple prose and a cheap thriller style.  This is not an artsy book with themes about mermaids or man's inhumanity to man.<br /><br />Third, there are several facts which Brown gets wrong, such as the directions of Paris when describing the journey through the city.  Just as moviegoers suspend their disbelief when viewing a thrilling action flick, readers of the DaVinci Code must realize that they're in for a Hollywood-ized version of art history and religious symbolism.<br /><br />All that being said, this book deserves five stars for what it is: an entertaining, gripping novel that's easy to read and hard to put down.  If you're looking for more depth, or an analysis of religious history, then look elsewhere.
B000056NX5|5.0|I loved this version! Andrew Lloyd Webber made it with his revival of the London cast. Every song was fantasic! I bought both movie versions - this one and the Norman Jewison version (1973) - and this one is definitly the best!I hope you will buy and enjoy it to.
0452282152|5.0|\\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" by Tracy Chevalier, set in 17th century Holland which deals with Griet, who worked as a maid in famous artisit, Vermeer's home. Griet was an exceptional young lady as she was observant, intelligent and very much in tune with paintings despite her humble background. In Vermeer's home, Griet had to deal with the insufferable mistress, Catharina as well as her children and the other maid who was hostile to Griet and considered her a threat. Not to mention, Vermeer trusted no one but Griet to clean his studio, which others don't have access to. Soon, Griet became Vermeer's \\"unofficial\\" assistant; grinding colors for his paintings, giving him suggestions and basically inspiring him. The author also explained one of Vermeer's most famous painting very vividly. She also did a fantastic job of characterizing their tension and feelings for each other. In the midst of this, there was also the local butcher's son who was out to woo Griet. <br /> <br />I really enjoy this book as I find Chevalier's writing very eloquent and at the same time, easy to understand. She was able to vividly describe the unspoken feelings that Griet and Vermeer had for each other. Using the first person narrative, we are able to see the confusion and the excitement that Griet felt for Vermeer even though she knew nothing would come out of it. In addition, Griet was also dealing with the other members of Vermeer's household who became suspicious of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. Besides the fact that this book was very well-written, I enjoy the historical background the Chevalier provided for her readers; such as the setting, the mentality of people in 17th century Holland, the roles of women in the society, and etc. It is obvious to me that Chevalier knew her subjects very well and were able to bring out their personalities which make the characters come alive. This is definitely one of the better historical fiction around.
B00004RF8J|3.0|I loved the songs from this version but I was dissapointed in the ending because I was looking forward to seeing the finale(Don't Feed The Plants)that was used in the off broadway (and broadway) productions and was intended to be the original ending in the movie (until test audience polls showed they did not like it). On the other hand I thought Rick Moranis made a great Seymour. Did anybody make an observation that they didn't have other songs from the original Off-Broadway production? They were: Now(It Just The Gas), Act 1 Finale, Enter'cate, Closed For Renovation, and Mushnik and Son. Anyway I still loved the other songs very much! Buy it! It's Gooooooooooood!
0689835604|4.0|I recently bought this book for my new born niece. She is now five months old. When I read her the book, she smiles and has this face of amazement on her. She stares at the bright colors and even tries to hold my hand when I flip the flaps over.  <br />While I'm reading her the book, I point to her (my niece) body parts that coincide with the book so she learns in many ways. <br /> <br />This book is great as a starter and is ideal for babies and toddlers which is a fun teaching tool for the human anatomy.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any new mother-to-be and/or parents of babies/toddlers!!! Teach your kids to read while they are really young and see what great things they can accomplish later!
B00005YW4H|1.0|Honey, you have a LONG way to go before you can join Ashanti and Beyonce in the big leagues.  You need to get a new sound or change your clothes or something because you are too DULL.  Get some flava, girlfriend!  This CD is just not working.  Not feeling it at all.
B00003CXCT|5.0|When I heard the DVD set was coming out, I rushed to make sure it WAS the special edition, because if it wasnt I would not buy it. What would you need a DVD set for if you want the lowest quality version? People if you don't like it, watch your old 1980's VHS tape. This one is for the people who like the extra effort put into the quality of the production now that it is possbile. The whiners must have old Zeinith TV sets with no a/v inputs *chuckle*
B00005JNEI|4.0|The most disturbing thing about this film is the reaction to it, especially by those who refuse to see it and only rely on their partisan support of President Bush as a means of judging it.  Having read extensively about most of the historical material, I really did not see much with which I was not familiar.  I was very grateful to Moore, however, for encapsulating this information into a 2 hour film and presenting it in a form which those unfamiliar with it could easily digest. I would have preferred that the entire film was an examination of the various connections between the Bush family, Arbusto/Harkin, Saudi Arabia, OBL, Halliburton, 9/11, etc.  If you are one of those for whom this information is completely unworthy of being seen because you will never believe there to be any connection (despite painstaking and extensive verification) then you should see the film and be pleasantly surprised that the whole film is NOT about these things.  On the other hand, if you are afraid that the very real words (on tape) of your own candidate will be used against him and his political allies, then do NOT see this film.  You will surely die of shame when you see what kind of unredeemedly inept, heartless and devious person it is that you so fervently support! Conversely, if you think that Iraq was equivalent to Afghanistan in the \\"War on Terror\\" then you will surely enjoy reliving the bombardment of Baghdad and be able to easily overlook the heartache caused to the families of those who have been lost in the war. In fact, you will find that \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is as All-American as John Ashcroft singing \\"Let the Eagle Soar\\" at the Fourth of July picnic!  You should not be afraid of Michael Moore's documentary!  Any  discomfort or fear you have should actually spring from seeing the words and actions of your own president, as these are what this film is made of.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|'Van Helsing' is from the director Stephen 'The Mummy' Sommers, and that means, you get lots of actions, mostly CGI-enhanced ones, with lots of monsters, plus silly dialogues.  You don't find any emotional depth or realisitic characterization here, and those who have seen his films -- any of them -- would not try to find them. <br /> <br />The central idea of 'Van Helsing' goes like this -- Hugh Jackman is the titular vampire hunter with a powered-crossbow, who hunts down the monsters, working for the Catholic Church.  and as this is a Universal Picture, most of them were once the features of the Universal horror pictures in the 30s and 40s.  You see werewolf, Jykell and Hyde, and Dracula himself, the last one played by awfully campy Richard Roxburgh.  And of course, he comes with three females with fangs. <br /> <br />That's it, and that's all.  Helsing fights against them, and meets beautiful Anna, played by Kate Beckinsale, a princess who teams up with Helsing.   <br /> <br />From the opening black-and-white shots which is a homage to Universal horror classics, 'Helsing' never stops, showing the fights after fights against the backdrop of Gothic archtectures.  Each scene is finished with first-rate CGI techniques, but the jaded eyes which have seen too many of them would see them with less surprises. <br /> <br />It is clear that Hugh Jackman is the best choice for the role, and so is Beckinsale, but it is Shuler Hensetey who would really impress you, as the Frankenstein's tragic monster.  And as for the story about the two leads, I am afraid that the ending will not satisfy all of you. <br /> <br />The story is long and confusing, and as to its emotional side the film remains hollow to the end, but there are actions enough for us to keep on watching, especialy the one including the Hulk-like enemy, and one extended fighting against the flying vampires.  And that's only beginning of the whole 2 hour story.    <br /> <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness(1995). The Smashing Pumpkin's Third Album.<br /><br />In 1995, Grunge and Alternative Rock was hitting its peak, and The Smashing Pumpkins' 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' and Alice In Chains' self-titled album gave the style its last gap, before bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and other abysmal bands became popular. With the release of the 60's Psychadelia influenced 'Gish' and the out-right masterpiece 'Siamese Dream', The Smashing Pumpkins had proven to the critics and the public they were a force to contend with. In an interview, Billy Corgan stated that the Pumpkins were going to release a 2-disc masterpiece, something that would set the standard for Alternative Rock. So the hype was on: When the album was released, 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' hit the top of the charts, and stayed there for quite a while, easily going multi-platinum despite being twice the price of a normal CD. It spawned the massive hits 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings' and '1979', not to mention minor hits like 'Tonight, Tonight' and 'Zero. With such buzz around the album, and the fact 'Siamese Dream' is one of my favorite albums, I expected a *ton* from this album: So was I impressed? Read on to find out!<br /><br />In 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness', Billy Corgan takes The Smashing Pumpkins in an epic direction, applying two discs, with totally different themes. The 'Dawn To Dusk' album is supposedly happy and uplifting, while the second disc, 'Twilight To Starlight', is supposed to be dark and foreboding. While there are exceptions to this rule(namely 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings'), that stays true throughout.<br /><br />Because of the massive amount of music, I will only try to describe the music instead of every track. Billy Corgan, to anyone familar with him, is one of the best songwriters ever, capable of blending an uplifting jazz ballad to a gothic heavy metal song without missing a beat. The man is amazing, layering buzzing and distorted guitars together for a symphonic and immersing sound, adding in keyboards, orchestra instruments, and other odd noises to create some amazing melodies and harmonies.<br /><br />From the scorching Gothic rock of 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings', to the moving orchestra ballad 'Galapagos', to the punk of 'Jellybelly' and 'Zero', to the confessions of '1979', The Smashing Pumpkins create an album so varied that the songs I mentioned are few of the many styles. If you write The Smashing Pumpkins off as \\"simply a garage band, or some Alternative Rock clone', you, my friend, are a moron. These guys are obviously the most creative and genre-bending band of the 90's. Basically, if you are a fan of any hard rock, and even the symphony orchestra, there is no doubt in my mind you would enjoy this: 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' didn't become one of the most popular albums of the 90's for nothing.<br /><br />As for the musicians, sometimes the music says it all. Billy Corgan, lead songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, displays a depth that even Dave Grohl can't match, blending numerous guitar melodies together to create an incredibly immersive beat, not to mention levelling the listener with his odd(great though, IMO) vocals. Jimmy Chamberlain, The Smashing Pumpkins drummer, is capable of setting the pitch, tone, and rhythm as deftly as Rush's Neil Peart and TOOL's Danny Carey, and his instrument is clearly not part of a crowd, but part of the sound. Bass player D'Arcy Wretzky, while taking a minor role in the band, supplies more than enough punchy and addictive basslines to satisfy the stingiest of critics. Guitarist James Iha, who went on to perform in the band A Perfect Circle, tunes and plays in perfect precision with Corgan, and needless to say he is magnificent. There are also numerous other musicians, from keyboardists to celloists to violinists, but that's the core of the band.<br /><br />Overall, 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' is flawless. Over two hours of sheer musical bliss, The Smashing Pumpkins take you on a journey, blending so many genres and styles it's impossible to define this, but in a word, I would say: Excellence. Although 'Siamese Dream' will always be my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album, 'Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness' is flat-out magnificent, displaying possibly the greatest songwriting and epic musicianship I've ever heard. Although I may be making the album sound like the best I've ever heard(it isn't), it's just plain awesome! Like '1979, 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings', 'Zero', or 'Tonight, Tonight'?

0783225857|5.0|for character names.  Atticus' son's name is Jem (not Jeb, not Jim).  It is short for Jeremy.  The town is Maycomb.  It is in Alabama (not Georgia).  And the poor white woman's name is Mayella Ewell.   <br /> <br />As to the movie, I've seen it dozens of times since I was 6 and it is one of the few movies that can touch the hem of the garment of the book (though it did change a few things, and leave some parts out--for example, Tom Robinson was shot 17 times and not once in the leg, and he was shot trying to escape prison).  It is a beautiful movie, despite the ugliness and three of the best played scenes are when the black minister tells Jean Louise Finch (Scout) \\"stand up.  Your father's passin'\\".  The other is at the beginning when Atticus is on the porch listening to Scout ask Jem what their momma was like.  You could feel the pain on Atticus' face.  The third and most beautiful was when the adult actress voiced over for Scout at the end and said she thought of those childhood times often--of Boo, of Tom Robinson..and of Atticus; and though you weren't told, you just knew that Atticus had died by then. <br />Also, I never felt that Mayella Ewell was evil.  Poor, deprived, ignorant and pathetic, but not evil.  In the book it was clear she had been molested by her father, who was definitely the villian in this tale.  All in all, a touching movie with great performances that has stood the test of time.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|One thing you can say about \\"Donnie Darko\\" is that it is certainly an ambitious film.  I wouldn't go so far as saying it is original,though.  It struck me as a less accessible Shyamalan film bogged down in psycho-babble, teen angst, and scientific mumbo jumbo.  That is not to say that director Richard Kelly doesn't keep the action moving, just confusing, like some David Lynch films.  The cast here performs earnestly with the material given them.  My understanding is that this film has developed a sizable cult following and I would respond to that,\\"Whatever!\\"
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|Well, after reading the 4 reviews posted, I simply could not resist putting in my two cents.  To say the new \\"American Idiot\\" single is INCREDIBLE, well that is simply an under-statement!!!  It has been 4 desperately long years since the boys from Cali put out an album and from what I've already heard it has definitely been worth the wait!!!  American Idiot is more than just the typical 3-chord, punk-rock these guys have been known for for years.....GREEN DAY is standing up and making a statement about the state of affairs here in our beloved America.  It has a great hook, a great message and a fuller, more rounded sound (the addition of a 4th studio guitar).   <br />  For those of you who don't know it, our little punk-rockers are growing up!!!  Sure, the releases on Lookout Records were great (for their time)...Kerplunk is still one of my favorite punk records of all time!  But with each release, the guys in Green Day have grown and their music has matured (almost like a fine wine).  What Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" did for mainstream radio, Green Day's \\"Dookie\\" paved the way for Alternative/Punk Rock.  \\"Insomniac\\" showed everyone that the boys from Berkley were more than just power-pop-punk, they were SERIOUS!  Sure \\"Nimrod\\" gave us \\"Time Of Your Life\\" which was way-overplayed, but it also showed a level of maturity that we had never seen from these guys before.  For me, personally, I LOVED \\"WARNING\\"!!!  It kind of brought me back full circle and felt very reminiscent of all the hooks I loved so much on Kerplunk.  Which brings me back to my original point... <br />  \\"American Idiot\\" is going to be simply incredible!!!  21 tracks that, played in order, will play out like a punk-rock opera.  Green Day is making a statement and if you aren't open-minded enough to hear it, then you are simply missing the boat.  Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt & Tre Cool are artists and to not respect them for experimenting with their sound is a true injustice.  There would be no Blink 182, Weezer, New Found Glory, etc. if it weren't for Green Day.  The impact they have had on Alternative/Punk/Emo (or whatever you want to call it) is undeniable!!!  My advice is to listen to the new CD for yourself and don't be too hard on Green Day.....THE MUSIC WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Maybe not exacttly to the books but one of the greatest achievements of all mankind put to the screen!!!!!
0812550706|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was about 13 and have read it at least once a year since (I am now 22).  I found in the text a glimmer of who I like to think I am.  They who thought it boring, anticlimactic, or poorly written have missed the stylistic point of the whole book.  When you were a child, did you think you were a child?  Did what you have to say make sense to you as well as other children?  It's easy as an adult to observe language patterns among the young and criticize Card's depiction of what their linguistic abilities \\"ought\\" to have been, but think of how you viewed the world when you were that age.  Have your language patterns really evolved so much in your own eyes that little geniuses speaking like adults is so far fetched?  The fact that this adult was able to write from the perspective of a child shows his genius and empathy. <br /> <br />This book was written for they who have been that child, who are ready to understand that child, and they who can see outside of their little box.   <br /> <br />The style, after a fashion, could be equated with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, by James Joyce.  He writes from the character's perspective as the character understands his world, rather than from the understanding and style of Mr. Card, per se.   <br /> <br />The ending may not be earth-shattering to you or I, but the point of the novel was that the ending was earth-shattering to Ender.  Card's work is not about the reader (though I'm sure he doesn't object to the royalties, haha) it's about Ender and the world he carries with him.  He touches each person around him in a very profound way.  That the book is written for Ender, not the reader.  Even the book, as written, puts Ender on a pedestal, thereby emphasizing his absolute solitude.
B0002MB7R6|3.0|It was an okay summer movie with good special effects and an okay story. Yet the middle becomes boring and does not knwo where to go. My opinion is that you rent it and judge it from there.
B0001QNFXW|5.0|This was an incredible concert w/ so much energy. This is definitely something you will watch over and over - I only wish I could have seen this live. this dvd version of his concert is reallly professional - the editing is superb.
B000089RVX|1.0|Evanescence sucks. Their just as bad as this other angst ridden garbage like Nirvana and Linkin Park. Amy Lee can't sing, and she's overrated. Her, Kurt Cobain, Chester Bennington, and Mike Shinoda are the worst rock vocalists ever. In fact, almost every rock band of today is just the same boring flat out garbage. A note to all these sucky bands:Quit whining about how miserable your lives are already, none of us wanna hear about it. It's a good thing we have bands like The Darkness and Jet, because hopefully that is a sign that will be saved from this angst-filled crap soon.
B000001C6M|5.0|I remember that some of these songs ('the final command' to 'show no mercy'), included in this HUGE album, were responsible, in my teen years, for a 2-3 years thrash-metal addiction ... All I can say that I was simply overwhelmed with joy. Powerfull songs like 'crionics', 'show no mercy' and 'tormentor' had a great impact on me. Even if \\"this is not their best\\", I higly recommand 'Show no mercy' to every metal maniac, or people who desire to have a first taste of this band of legend.

B0001HAISG|2.0|Peter Pan is a timeless story for children of all ages, but this movie drags out each scene beyond the limits of our ability to sit quietly without fidgeting.  The (actual) children that watched it with me were filled with a sense of wonder (as in \\"I wonder when this scene is going to end\\").  The continued state  of \\"peril\\" for the child actors in this story makes the whole scenario work better as a cartoon (cannonballs?  sharp swords? drowning? arrows? plummeting from great heights?).  It is surprising that some other reviewers think that the most dangerous thing this film will teach kids is how to \\"mouth\\" kiss. Also, the same actor plays both Capt. Hook and Wendy's father.  Is there a single kids' film that doesn't feature this tired Oedipal angle?
0425180638|4.0|I need to stop reading these amazon reviews before I read the actual book.  I was skeptical about this one. Especially with all of the medicore to poor reviews.  I really liked this one. As a matter of fact, I think it is one of my favorites.  I think Cornwell did an excellent job in the suspense department. I was riveted.  It did take a while to get into this book. That is the only reason I rated this a 4.<br /><br />I foresee a change in Scarpetta's life after this book.  I think it is a good transition.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with this one.  I highly recommend...
B00006BTCA|5.0|I have read the customer reviews and frankly agree with most of you who think that it doesn't matter what Interpol sounds like...they rock!  And that's all that matters.  It is a refreshing sound that they have created on \\"Turn On the Bright Lights.\\"  And when I am soaring above the Shomali Plains of Afghanistan in a helicopter at sunset...that music...well...it makes for a mesmerizing flight!
B00006ADFL|5.0|Jackson's fiery screenplay and stunning dreamscape  montages became eerily real when I read on the closing credits that it was all based on the real diaries of one its adoloscent protagonists.<br /><br />It is a difficult story of filial murder -- two sisters so devoutly in love with each other that they would go any lengths to stick together, including murdering their own mother --  but the film captures it with unsparing sharpness, deeply disturbing in its potrayal of the whims of the human mind.<br /><br />Apart from that surface theme, Heavenly Creatures also hints at deeper issues. There is a strong attraction between the two girls, and the film doesn't fudge the glint of lesbianism. In fact in its mocking treatment of the adults who try to label their friendship as \\"unwholesome\\", the film urges us to look beyond any tidy summaries.<br /><br />It is also refreshing to see a director respecting the complexity of each character's obsessions; the murderers are not necessarily driven by deliberate evil, but victims of turbulent imaginations themselves. Despite their crazy behaviour, we end up empathizing with them as well as the mother. In this regard, the three central performances by  Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet and Sarah Peirse are simply riveting.<br /><br />Jackson is now known for his 'Lord of the Ring' histrionics. The imagery in this film tells us why he reached that pinnacle.<br /><br />The DVD sadly is a bit sparse, devoid of the special features a film of this cadre so richly deserves, but the film itself is a pulse-pounding must-see of a murder yarn. Recommended in a blink.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|At first I thought I was going to hate it, since i read one or two bad reviews, but i am happy to say that alan parsons is back to the beginning, an I think it is great!!!!  Just as APP was selling out and sounding like phil collins they have finally come out with an album like I robot and pyramid. These were not, in my opinion, not meant to be chart topper but neat concepts.  That seem to be what Valid Path is.  A neat concept.  All those who are trying to relive their 80's proms. . . get over it! Move on.. . take the valid path and chill.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Let me call the bluff on these emperor's clothes: once you strip this supposed art house tosh of its longer-than-necessary \\"art porn\\" scenes and other sundry pretentions, there really is very little left in its average revenge story.<br /><br />There's graphic intensity, and then there's graphic exploitation. Irreversible (which as a lame play on words is told in a reverse chronological order) almost  always teeters on the brink of the latter, shocking for the sake of shocking, gory for the sake of being gory.<br /><br />If voyeuristic fireworks is what you're after, at least real porn maintains the honesty of not hiding its true identity behind an artistic veneer. I regret that the colossal waste of time on this idiotic film is indeed irreversible.
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|\\"Resident Evil\\" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.<br /><br />I spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike \\"Blade.\\"<br /><br />As stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some \\"Mortal Kombat\\"-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to \\"Mortal Kombat.\\"  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  \\"Resident Evil\\" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.<br /><br />The horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of \\"jump-at-you\\" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.<br /><br />As far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of \\"making of\\" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.<br /><br />Overall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.es.

1591840562|5.0|Guy has done it again! \\"The Art of The Start\\" strips away all the business babble and gets to the core of what it takes to make a business great. As a MBA grad that had to endure many business school textbooks, I can tell you that I learned a lot more from this book than most of my \\"required reading\\". <br /> <br />The book starts by asking some basic questions: \\"Do you have the right stuff to be an entrepreneur?\\" and \\"Are you creating a company with meaning?\\". From there, Guy walks you through the process of building the dream - specifically, writing business plans, pitching, bootstrapping, raising capital, partnering, branding, and rainmaking. <br /> <br />The book written in a style that is very entertaining, yet contains so much wisdom that it feels like you have Guy sitting beside you as mentor. After my first reading of the book, I was inspired to implement Guy's advice on a variety of business decisions. I expect to read it again in the upcoming weeks so that I may extract more of Guy's wisdom.

0142004235|1.0|Actually, I give this powerful book *itself* a four-1/2 star rating. I was captivated by the movie (starring James Dean and Raymond Massey) as a teenager, and quickly thereafter read the book, which is excellent. <br /> <br />But -- and this is a big but, almost as big as the caboose of the media-savvy atipose-laden \\"diva\\" hawking this recycled volume -- for the Schlockmistress of all schlockmistresses, Oprah Winfrey, to appropriate this great literary classic and to debase it by affixing her name and its attendant bad taste is beyond the pale. <br /> <br />To lump Steinbeck in with the mediocre subliterary pabulum and chick-lit fluff she usually shills for lowers the Nobel-prize winning author to the level of Frau Winfrey's touchy-feely, brain-dead, trash-TV audience. <br /> <br />What's next? \\"Dr. Phil's Great Books Series,\\" featuring Carl Jung's \\"The Undiscovered Self\\" as the premiere volume??? <br /> <br />Please, dear readers, buy *some other* edition, one that doesn't insult the intelligence of readers who didn't need a cheesy gimmick like \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" to get them to pick up a tome.
B00012QM8G|3.0|i love this film but can't say the same for the DVD.  The Dvd just looked cheap.  There's no art so it just looks like one of those rewritables.  Should have been on two dvds.  Then theres the awful cover which is just made from paper material!  Just after opening the cellophane wrap i got fingerprints all over it.  The cover should have been the traditional plastic.  If the marketers really wanted paper, they should have put the paper over the plastic cover like how Beauty and Beast is done.  This is arguably one of the greatest movies but the dvd edition does not come close to doing it justice.
1400034779|4.0|The debut novel in this series is the weakest one, but still good. Still, don't skip \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,\\" as each novel builds on the one that came before.<br /><br />The novel appears to be a collection of short stories about the cases of Mma Precious Rebotswe, a clever and gentle Botswanan woman who goes into the detective business armed only with a how-to book, an incomparable secretary and her own good sense. In the end, it turns out to be enough, and all the stories tie in together by the last page.<br /><br />The next book, \\"The Tears of the Giraffe,\\" is even better. In fact, each of Alexander McCall Smith's books is better than the one that came before. (What a nice twist from what usual happens: that is, a writer has a great idea for a series, but then runs out of steam.)
B00005JMUA|4.0|Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 was slick, gory, and cinematographically fantastic, with character development and plot partially being sacrificed for the violence and action. Vol.1 was a fast-paced tribute to pop culture of both east and west - and for that reason, many people criticise vol. 2 because its basically the opposite. But you have to remember that its not so much a sequel as the second half of a film. Vol.2 does not have the blood-spraying violence and in-your-face tenacity that gives the first film its bite, but it does have richer character development and also an emotional maturiy that was not as apparent in the first volume. <br />Vol. 2 should not disappoint, though - the coffin scene, the opening flashback in black/white, and especially the 'cruel tutelage of pai mei' (in my opinion the movie's best scene). <br />For those expecting vol.1's ferocity with perhaps even more, you'll be disappointed, but it doesn't stop Kill Vill Vol. 2 from being one mad film.
B000005GYI|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece. In general, I like Rock and Roll, nevertheless I adore the songs of this album, mainly \\"A Girassol Da Cor De Seu Cabelo\\". The beauty of the lyrics of this song is impressive. I'm amazed when I listen her. But the  whole CD is amazingly. No doubt, if Milton Nascimento had issued only this album, even so, he could be considered a genius.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have to tip my hat to Lucas' marketing savvy. While the ideal release of these films would have gone EVEN further than the Alien Quadrilogy, Lord Of The Rings Extended Editions, and the forthcoming 10-disc Matrix treasure chest, Lucas is going to toss this relative 4-disc pittance of a release...for the time being. Given the history of the original trilogy, the impact upon popular culture, the colossus of its fandom, all you're going to get is the jerked with (oops, \\"enhanced\\") editions of these beloved classics. Could he have packaged these with BOTH the original AND rejiggered versions? Of course he could have. Even Spielberg came to his senses and included both versions at the last minute (allegedly - I think it was a genius ploy all along) of \\"E.T.\\". But not Lucas. What kind of idiot is he? You would think after the damage the saga has taken as a result of the horrific prequels, he might consider engendering some good will with the fans and give them an orgy of bonuses and goodies. Think again. What I suspect is going to happen is that this box set will go ahead as planned and be released as is. It will reap an enormous windfall for Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox video. But then, in a certain amount of time, probably already determined in the corporate headquarters, a new campaign will be launched: \\"Due to overwhelming demand, the original trilogy will be released intact, complete with new commentaries and bonuses\\". And the fans NO DOUBT will line up and buy them ALL OVER AGAIN. Genius. One would be a fool to think this plan of action has not been AT LEAST bandied about. Just don't be surprised when it all goes down... Oh, and let me not fail to mention the nascent technology in the next year or two: High Definition DVDs. Yup, after you've shelled out for however many incarnations Lucas decides to rob you blind for, you WILL buy them all up, all over again. You will line his pockets to make even more horrific films. Rumor has it Lucas IS going to make \\"episodes\\" 7, 8, and 9. After all he's done to sink the franchise, I hope he and his films end up in the wastebasket of spectacular failures that he's driven them to. Good riddance.
038551123X|4.0|In Dexter Morgan, author Jeff Lindsay has created one of the most entertaining and intriguing characters I have seen in a long time while giving an original twist to the serial-killer murder-mystery genre.   <br /> <br />Dexter is a kind-of warped super hero, a serial killer who tries to murder only evil-doers (with a special interest in abusers of children).  He knows he has a problem (the need to kill) that must be managed carefully.  He frets about slipping from being simply sociopathic to becoming a full-fledged psychopath. Emotionless and analytical, Dexter is regularly stunned and perplexed by the passions that surround him, especially of the women in his life.  What does an inhuman serial killer do when his usefully frigid girlfriend suddenly breaks through her inhibitions and reaches out for human contact?   <br /> <br />The one thing sure to enflame Dexter's senses is a good, clean, bloodless murder, preferably with some artistic flare.  When beautfully dissected bodies start showing up, Dexter struggles between helping his police-officer sister solve the crime and wanting to meet the master behind the murders.  The story moves with joyously wicked humor until just the very end.  But somehow the conclusion seemed out of synch with the rhythm and tone of what came before.  Maybe it resolved too many open questions all at once.  In any case, it left me a little disappointed.  Still, the novel is so original and entertaining that the finish is a minor let-down.  And I look forward to seeing Dexter in a sequel.

B00005JMX6|4.0|The Girl Next door is about an ex-porn star who moves next door to a nerdy high school student.  He becomes immediately infatuated with her, and she develops an attraction to him.  His innocent life clashes with the hardened lifestyle she has acquired within the porn industry.  He gets conned by her pimp-like producer.  In the end, he fights back and wins the girl.  Overall, this is a cute and cleverly written film.  Elisha Cuthbert comes across as a good match for Emile Hirsch.  Unfortunately, she's just not credible as a porn star.  Although extremely sexy, she still seems way too innocent.  And the idea of a porn star developing an attraction to a nerdy high school student like Hirsch is unrealistic in itself.  Still, I thought this was a fun film to watch.  The story would be a fantasy come true for any young male.
B00003CXCT|4.0|These are three of the best movies ever produced, in their original form.  The revamps to these movies wouldn't be a bad thing if they were integrated well.  The primary disappointment with this box set is the absence of the original films.   This means that my Laserdisc set is still the definitive star wars set.  They could have easily transferred these over to DVD with minimal cost as they do include commentary.  The only downside to the Laserdisc set is that it is 16 sides.   Sigh...
B0000D96NW|5.0|I have been a MH fan since day 1.  Burn My Eyes saw a whole new chapter in metal.  They were classified Nu-Metal, but they sounded Slayer-esque!  Screw Nu-Metal, these guys are in their OWN category.  Well, being a fan, I went and got the Demon Knight Soundtrack, which yeilded yet another track.  I waited and waited and along comes The More Things Change.. It was nice and heavy, but its' best track being Ten Ton Hammer kind-of lacked a lot in my eyes.  Along comes The Burning Red.. Most notable for the cover of Message in a Bottle (AWESOME) and From This Day (I believe to be their actual first charted hit).  Although not their best (because Burn My Eyes could'nt be topped), still an excellent work.  Along comes Supercharger.. LONG awaited; and opening with a song that made me jump out of my seat.  Bulldozer.  The drums blew me away just like BME did.  The opening riff reminds me of Slayer in a BIG way.  The rest of the album was \\"OK\\".  Still MH, but not quite MH.  So here comes TTAOE..... F*****G WOW!.  I NEARLY SOILED MY BOTTOMS WHEN I LISTENED TO IMPERIUM.  Energy, energy, and MORE energy!  And the break cut that reminds me once again, of Slayer.  I heard a little Angel of Death in it, and the rest is history!  Some of the strongest lyrics I ever heard from Flynn.  One definite stand out line is in track 3, \\"F*** YOU, YOU C*CKS**KER, F*** YOU, YOU WH*RE!\\"  Man that was just as strong as \\"LET FREEDOM RING WITH A SHOTGUN BLAST!\\"  Thank you guys, thank you for coming to your senses!!! ROCK ON!
6302561841|5.0|Contains music and sound effects.<br /><br />  I didn't fully appreciate Charlie Chaplin until I became a mature adult and had learned what respectible work he had done.  I once got into City Limits (1931).  Chaplin was a short funny man.  It wasn't until I saw him as an older gentleman in a clip on the Academy Awards program that aired April 10, 1972, when he was being honored that I realized him.  It was his first trip back in America in years and he said to the audience, \\"you dear people\\", with tears in his eyes.  He was so humble.<br /><br />  Turner Classic Movies recently ran a 24-hour marathon of Chaplin films in August 2004.  He did do films that were speaking roles.  He was so brilliant in A King In New York (1957).  Modern Times (1936) is Chaplin at his best.  The first 18 minutes with Chaplin as a factory worker is hilarious.  I was shocked to see the muscled-man factory worker \\"Section Five\\" with his shirt always off here in this 1936 film.<br /><br />  Chaplin is a factory worker and possibly the best, but he gets no respect.  Not even enough time to use the bathroom.  The boss even tries a new invention on getting the employees to eat faster.  Chaplin goes insane, or rather, has a nervous breakdown, and is sent to jail for disturbing and damaging the factory.  Now out of jail and the factory closed down, Chaplin just walks the street.  he finds a dropped flag from a truck and he picks it up.  Suddenly, a stampede of angry Union Workers come from behind him.  He innocently gets mixed in with the crowd and the police see the flag he is holding and he is sent to jail again.  That is just the beginning of the story.<br /><br />  There are hundreds of funny bits in thi film, but what is disturbing to me is when the little guy mistakenly is sent to jail all over again.  But when he gets out, he does find love in a woman (Paulette Goodard, who later became Chaplin's real wife).<br /><br />  Gloria DeHaven is one of the young orphans.

B00028HBKM|5.0|In this amazing and moving story, Academy Award winner Mel Gibson describes the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus Christ, from the Last Supper to the Crucifixion.  Jesus was betrayed by Judas and handed over to his enemies, who condemn him and sentence him to die.  He is brought before Pontus Pilate, who has Jesus bound and flogged.  The flogging scenes are some of the most graphic of the movie.  Finally, Pontus Pilate agrees to turn Jesus over for Crucifixion. <br /> <br />The Crucifixion is one of the most moving and powerful segments of the movie.  Seeing Jesus crying and asking God to forgive his captors literally brought tears to my eyes.  Jesus also promised salvation to one of the thieves, also crucified, who repented of his sins.  Jesus' death was marked by a darkening of the world, and when one of the soldiers was told to pierce Jesus' side to make sure he was dead, blood and water poured from the wound.  Jesus was finally taken down from the cross on Good Friday and laid to rest in the tomb, but he was resurrected three days later on Easter Sunday. <br /> <br />This is one of the most powerful and awe-inspiring films I've ever seen.  Director Mel Gibson does a remarkable job describing the last hours of Jesus' life and the scenes, especially the flogging, cross-bearing, and Crucifixion, are some that I'll never forget.  I highly recommend this powerful and moving film.  Watch and see how our Savior suffered and died for our sins and won the ultimate victory with his resurrection.
0440238609|5.0|The five stars I give are for the beauty of writing and the brillance of the author as a creator and a storyteller. <br /> <br />I would normally spend a long time in person to praise the author, but as a quick note for the inquiring reader, the books are very Anti-Christian (and Anti-Jewish, even blaspheming the Tetragrammaton [Hebrew 4-letter name of God] itself).  The charges against the church are by and large false, but are based on some abuses of the church and some disagreements of the author with Christianity given to satire. <br /> <br />Some of the subject matter is centered around discussions of sexuality- parents, do not just hand the books to your children without a thourough read yourself.  (I would generally say they aren't for children at all). <br /> <br />If you are an open-minded adult, willing to spend the time to know the areas where Pullman is fancifully critical of historic Christianity, then I heartilly recommend these books for the read.

You will stay awake during the first \\"chapter\\" because you have never seen a town laid out completely in chalk, including the town dog. No danger of a set design Academy Award for this puppy. If you stay awake during the next seven chapters you will find yourself jumping up and yelling at the screen for someone to help this sweet, innocent woman and kick some serious Dogville behind. Where have all the cowboys gone?  By the final chapter you may be considerably confused as to good guys/bad guys, but I finally got some satisfaction.  I don't see the anti-American issue but there are clear religious overtones, especially at the end of the movie when I said to my significant other, \\"Thank God, we only rented that for $2 bucks.\\"

0792839730|5.0|Following the success of the Normandy invasion of June, 1944, the Allies launched operation Market Garden the following September.  This operation was an attempt to put an early end to the war and have the boys home for Christmas.  The plan was for the Allies, including the crack American 82nd and 101st airborne divisions and the British 1st airborne and XXX corps, to advance up a narrow 64 mile long road in Holland to the town of Arnhem, where the forces would turn east, cross the Rhine, and smash the German industrial area in the Ruhr valley. <br /> <br />However, a combination of faulty intelligence, battlefield politics, bad luck, and poor weather led to disaster beyond the Allies' darkest fears.  The Allies thought that they would be facing 2nd line German troops when in reality, they were parachuting onto two fully equipped front line panzer divisions.  The British airborne troops in Arnhem were supposed to be reinforced in two days, but after nine days, the British were completely surrounded and forced to surrender. <br /> <br />The movie was shot on the actual battlefield locations, and at the time was one of the costliest films ever made.  What makes this movie so special is its all-star cast.  A who's who of actors appear, including James Caan (Sgt. Eddie Dohun), Michael Caine (Col. Joe Vandeleur), Sean Connery (Gen. Robert Urquhart), Gene Hackman (Gen. Stanislaw Sosabowski), Anthony Hopkins (Lt. Col. John Frost), Laurence Olivier (Dr. Spaander), Ryan O'Neil (Gen. James \\"Jumpin Jim\\" Gavin), Robert Redford (Maj. Julian Cook), and Maximillian Schell (Lt. Gen. Wilhelm Bittrich).  With 35,000 men, 300 miles, nine days, and six bridges, Market Garden was the largest airborne assault in military history. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this excellent movie.  The acting is first rate and the painstaking efforts to assure authenticity and realism are clearly evident throughout the film.  Watch and see how a combination of elements conspired to cause a disaster that the Allies never expected.

Halle Berry was mediocre as was the rest of her supporting cast. <br /> <br />All in all, the first half of the movie is enjoyable but the climax/ ending will leave you speechless (not in a good way). It leaves you thinking \\"wow, it turned from a ok movie to an outrageously dumb freak show.\\"
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix has really become the premiere young adult author extraordinaire of the dark fantasy novel.  If you are looking for a writer who writes books containing happy unicorns and cute dancing sprites, Nix is not for you.  In this, his first teen novel (amazingly good on that level alone) he creates a world of death, destruction, death, decay, and a little more death.  His heroine constantly walks in the lands of the dead, fights the moral equivalent of zombies left and right, and is gratifyingly competent.  Nix is that rare male author that is just as comfortable penning gruesome fight sequences as he is the intricacies of female menstruation.  If you're looking for a kickin' gal in a wholly original fantasy, \\"Sabriel\\" is the book to look up.<br /><br />The only daughter of her father, a man referred to by everyone as Abhorsen, Sabriel grew up in a female boarding school.  Don't expect this to be yet another Harry Potter-like creation, however.  Mere pages after we see our eighteen year old heroine within the walls of her home she has discovered that her father is in dire peril.  You see, the Abhorsen is the mage that fights continually to keep the creatures of the dead out of the lands of the living.  With the realization that her father needs her help, Sabriel becomes the Abhorsen herself and travels to a distant Old Kingdom to save him.  Along the way she picks up the small white cat Mogget, a kind of snarky sarcastic servant bound to help the Abhorsens for generations.  She also meets and rescues the man Touchstone, a guilt ridden man trapped in the bow of a ship for 200 years.  Making continually trips into the world of Death, Sabriel discovers her own destiny and must decide how to fight the Abhorsens' greatest enemy.<br /><br />Garth Nix is the master of the action sequence.  I read one of Mr. Nix's earlier books, \\"Shade's Children\\" not long ago and, like this book, that one was obsessed with the nature of life and death.  This book is slightly less gory than the former, but only just slightly.  If you haven't the stomach for books in which zombies (Nix never calls them this, but if we're gonna be honest this book is just a slightly fantastical reinterpretation of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\") try to eat our young heroine, young women have their throats slit by their own brother, and humanoids with Bosch-like characteristics flop about every other page... don't bother with this one.  If, on the other hand, you've a strong stomach and a taste for the peculiar, Nix is worth the read.  Like many male authors, he's not comfortable giving his heroine a sense of humor, but otherwise Sabriel is a pip.  She's competent and careful.  At the same time, she isn't a superhero or anything.  Sabriel makes mistakes once in a while or overextends herself when she shouldn't.  Other characters in this story may appear a little familiar.  Mogget the cat bears a striking resemblance to the far more recent Bartimaeus from \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" in terms of snide servility.  As for Touchstone, he's basically Taran from \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\".  Nix is such an accomplished writer, however, that even as you read these familiar characters, they seem fresh and interesting.<br /><br />It takes a very certain kind of person to be a Garth Nix fan.  If you're into women kicking butt, there's no butt kicker more accomplished than the clever Sabriel.  Nix truly has written an incredibly detailed and original world.  From the villains to the Abhorsen's weapons of choice (mainly bells) this book is like no other fantasy novel written today.  As long as you understand that this book is not a namby pamby tale written with anything even mildly cutesy (except, perhaps, the potentially murderous and fluffy Mogget), you will go into this tale prepared.  A highly engaging and original creation.gory than the former, but only just slightly.

B000001EUP|5.0|First of all this record is by far the most energic album by the Scorpions, it's really a hell of a fast album. The title track is a heavy metal classic that everyone should own, \\"No One Like You\\" which was the Scorps biggest hit at the time is a perfect combination of harmonic verses and a powerful ,and cool, chorus. \\"Dynamite\\", it's exactly what it's name sugests a dynamite, near the end there's a epic \\"China White\\" , sort of similar to some of their 70's work, where the explores the concept of a corrupted world; it's a long song with good solos and an haunting rhythm. <br />Last it's the power ballad \\"When The Smoke Is Going Down\\", which is about the feeling of playing a live show, melacholic but an amazing work of art with an incredible voice work by Klaus Meine, for me it's the best ballad they've ever written. <br /> <br />Final Note: if you want STINGS, Blackout is the perfect choice to start; this album makes me wonder how can a band make such MasterPiece and then makes thoses CRAPS Pure Instinct and Eye II Eye albums. BLACKOUT is a MUST HAVE for every 80's Metal fans
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is definitely a man with an agenda.  He has made no bones about his opinion of the Bush administration, so it stands to reason that this film would be biased against the current administration to a certain degree.  Not that having an agenda in and of itself is a bad thing.  We all have agendas.  But it is good to know what the persons agenda is beforehand.<br /><br />The Bush supporters will call this film a lie, the anti-Bush folks will call it the gospel.  So dependant on a persons opinion, so will go their opinion of this film.<br /><br />I can't say that I buy into the film completely, but if 50% of what it documents is true, even if only 25% is true, then this country is in very sad shape indeed. If Michael Moore has overstated his case against the Bush administration, that is no more deplorable than the overstating of the necessity for the Iraq war by the administration. We all need to hear both sides, even the rabidly pro and con to help make up our minds. No one side has a monopoly on the truth.<br /><br />That is why I gave this film 5 stars.  Not that I believe everything it has to say, but that we've heard the other side's viewpoint over and over.  It is a film that should be watched by all who are concerned about the road this country is traveling.  Watch it, and make up your own mind.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Many of the musicals shown in clip form on these terrific documentaries are rarely seen, even today.... but to hear some of the greats speak about them is amazing. This set will be one that will be perfect for DVD... to see your favorite snippets whenever you want and go right to it will be great! My personal favorites? The FIRST version of \\"Singing in the Rain\\" from 1929.... Joan Crawford doing a song and dance with some boys and introduced as \\"the personification of youth, beauty, joy and happiness\\".... and indeed she was! ... and Eleanor Powell dancing her way from stage to stage as they are seamlessly moved from place to place.... she never misses a step! This is a treasury that will get play over and over.
0767802659|4.0|If you haven't seen this yet I advise that you do, but if you haven't seen a Paul Verhoven movie before I recommend that you see Robocop or Total Recall (preferably Robocop) before you see this.  Some say that this is a dull film spending too much time on the youngsters who join the Mobile Infantry to become citizens of the Federation, turning it into a soap opera in space, when it could be focusing on the action on the battlefield.  Well folks, it does both of these in a good balanced ammount.  It's even better for those who like this movie since it has a running time of 136 minutes or so, so you can just eat this up for it's long running time if you like it, or fall asleep if you don't.  We start off with Johnny Ricco, a guy just getting out of high school with his friends.  Interestingly enough they all decide to join the military to get special privelidges afterwards except for Ricco, who joins for his girlfriend, but ends up wanting revenge when his home town is destroyed by astroids sent by the arachnids, giant bugs that kill people very violently.  The Federation is the collective that controls most of what happens in the world and there are several little TV news breaks that come on to show us updates about events in the war and other things much like Robocop, which was also written by Ed Neumeier.  Once this movie takes off from the opening subjects of leaving home and meeting new people we are thrown in the violent world of epic battles directed by Paul Verhoven.  Expect to see limbs flying and people getting chopped in half left and right.  If it weren't for the nudity and extreme violence this movie could be rated PG-13.  It has a very upbeat and alot of the time comical mood, Verhoven makes his satirical films as cheesy as he can to aid the social comment by using humor, and there is some good stuff in this one.  What more can I say?  The special effects are amazing, and some of the acting isn't to great, but that's to the benefit of Verhoven's mission.The ending of this film might seem a little abrupt, but there is a sequel (don't roll your eyes just yet!).  Let me tell you that Starhip Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation is a movie that continues the story on a differnt plain and doesn't wear out the elements.  It may be a video release but it is enjoyable.    I recommend that everyone see this movie, but they might want to cover their kid's eyes at a few parts.

B000065U1N|3.0|SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a brilliant film because it not only showed the horror of war, but it also let us know something about the participants.  BLACK HAWK DOWN certainly reiterates the fruitlessness of war, and shows how our government was not prepared for the events laid out in this film.  We sent a few men in, compared to thousands and thousands of militiament, and evidently thought they were just going to lay down their arms and surrender.  This lack of vision on the US brought about a disastrous 16 hours of hell for these soldiers.<br /><br />Ridley Scott gives us gruesome and dynamic visions of battles, but unlike Steven Spielberg, he doesn't give us much to know about the various personalities in the film.  In spite of this, some good performances are offered by Josh Hartnett, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor.  Many of the other actors are lost in their anonymity.<br /><br />A well made but somehow empty film.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have read a review of the new trilogy DVD set online and here are some of the major changes from the 1997 Special Edition versions. 1)Han and Greedo shoot at the same time and the effect of Han dodging Greedo's laser blast has been vastly improved. 2)Vader's lightsaber is now red throughout the Obi-Wan duel, not the white color it has appeared in the original and the SE versions before. 3)Luke no longer screams while falling down into Cloud City after the Vader duel. 4)Jabba the Hutt had been redone with newer CGI in A New Hope and from the screenshots I've seen, he looks much better (still not great though). 5)The final major change is that they put Hayden C. (teen Anankin from Attack of the Clones) into The Return of the Jedi's shot that has the ghostly forms of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching the celebration on Endor. Look, I'm a fan of the original versions too, but most the new DVD changes (besides #5) really improve on the 1997 Special Editions. At least George Lucas has taken the middle ground by listening to fans and still putting forth the versions that he wants to. After all, these are his films and I'm just glad that on Sept. 21st I will own these classics on DVD. It's about time!
B000099T2L|3.0|This is an average debut album from one-third of R&B trio Destiny's Child and she's the most successful of the three. However I don't get the hype when she's about to release this much-awaited solo debut.  <br /> <br />First single 'Crazy In Love' has an addictive beat and only the chorus stands out. Jay-Z's rap part is kinda sudden and abrupt. Not a good combination. 'Baby Boy' is a good song with an arabian-like sound. This and the former went to #1 on Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for a freakin' long time. 'Me, Myself & I' is a soothing mid tempo song.  <br /> <br />Other average songs include 'Naughty Girl', 'Hip Hop Star', and 'Speechless'. The duet with Luther Vandross is rather forgettable. Missy Elliott-produced tracks are hot but just ok. 'Dangerously In Love' is the best song in this album. She remade it from Destiny's Child recent effort Survivor. The rest are just fillers. I don't listen much to this album cos it gets boring. She don't deserve the 5 Grammys. I think Christina Aguilera put out a better album (Stripped). <br /> <br />Beyonce has great vocal prowess but she needs to put that in good use. If you're looking for good R&B-soul listen to Alicia Keys. At least the latter's 5 Grammys was all worth it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I don't know what these other people are whining about.  This movie follows the book very closely.  The special effects are impressive, and the story line is great.  <br /> <br />As others have said, I highly recommend you read the book BEFORE you watch the movie, but if you have no intention of reading the book, it's a great film by itself. <br />
B0002IQNAG|4.0|First I want to thank the M80 Dawn of the Dead team for my early copy. Every fan should buy this set today! The Dawn of the Dead Ultimate set is awesome for any George Romero fans. This 4 Disc set in widescreen format contains hours of zombie watching. The box is done in black and the inserts were nice.  On the first disc you get to see the Dawn of the Dead we saw in theaters. There are also cool commentaries and trailers which I missed the first time it came out. There's some interesting stuff with a gallery thing they had showing a comic preview and some stuff about Romero. There is also some other stuff on the first disc that I didn't get to yet but I will. The second disc has the extended stuff which made it so worth getting the set for me. It's not like seeing a new movie but it was nice. There is some commentary by the producer in this one and some more gallery stuff with prodction stills and etc. The third disc contains the European Version which was shorter than the U.S. version we all saw, or at least the one I saw and loved. At this point of watching the dvd set I was turing into a zombie myself. A happy zombie I point out. The most interesting things on this disc were the UK tv ad for the film and the commentaries. There was some more gallery stuff which I still haven't yet watched because I wanted to save a little something for later. The fourth disc contains featurette Monroeville Mall tour with George Romero on set home movies with commentary from Robert Langer, document of the dead and the dead will walk. The video quality and audio quality throughout this film was amazing. I can't believe they did such a good job with the tranfer. There are a nice amount of extras to make most fans happy. Unlease the zombie in you and get this set says the cookie. If you haven't seen this film before you might want to rent it first but not fans.

0765301598|3.0|This book really isn't all that bad as others would have you believe.  While Kevin and Brian don't have the overarching and deeply philisopical points to their story like Frank Herbert did they do a fair job on telling a good tale and getting in some background.  As for providing information on different things, it would be very difficult for them in a 3 novel series to cover hundreds of years of information after the war but they do provide good insite into many of the instituions in the later Dune novels.  Just waiting for Dune 7 and will not be surprised if the Return is because of an Omnius incarnation and religious war is once again spread across the galaxy.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Ignore the haters!  If you love a disaster flick (and who doesn't?) this movie is for you.  You can throw all your other disaster movies away: DAT is the real deal!  Armageddon?  No way!  They blew up the meteor before it got here!  Even the aliens in Independance Day attacked only major of cities and left the rural areas untouched.  The superstorms of Day After Tomorrow ravage the entire northern hemisphere and pick no favorites...everybody gets screwed.  Plus you get to see tornados ruin LA and much much more.  I'm telling you right now, this is the coolest movie of the summer.  I saw it twice and can't wait until it proudly adorns my collection at home.  If you love chaos as much as I do, I suggest you check out my site.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|I've been a major fan of The Allman Brothers-Live at the Fillmore since it originally came out in vinyl. The interplay between Duane and Dickie as well as Butch and Jaimoe was unbeatable to this day. I believe in the 90's, the late,great producer, Tom Dowd went through the original master tapes and improved the recording even more by splicing songs together from different performances seemlessly as well as remixing/remastering the entire recording. It also included tracks that originally appeared on EAT A PEACH as well as  the song, DRUNKEN HEARTED BOY with Elvin Bishop. All these tracks are missing from the Hybrid SACD version. The titles are as they originally appeared when the lp was first released.  <br />Personally if a cd is going to get the deluxe SACD treatment, it should have had the material that Tom Dowd labored so hard to improve. Now that he's gone he must be spinning in his grave seeing the original recording being used. <br />Sure sonically it's simply phenomenal but it could've been over 2 1/2 hours long yet the first cd clocks in at about 37 minutes far below the 80 min. capacity of any cd. Universal, the company that distributed the cd should be ashamed. They'd have sold many, many more had they used the aformentioned improved tapes rather than the original. All in all however, it still sounds fantastic but it could've been SO much better.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Okay, so maybe it isn't what Homer had in mind.  But if it meant reaching a larger audience than those who would have normally read his story- who knows.  The point is \\" Troy \\" is excellent from all standpoints.  Best of all, the dialouge snaps instead of the endless pontificating which has been in every historical epic from \\" Braveheart \\" through \\" Gladiator \\".  I went into this movie with little expectation and came out very pleased at what I had invested my time in seeing.  Forget all the buzz and enjoy this film for what it is- a throw-back to the old Hollywood epics but with a modern twist.
1576751988|4.0|To give you a better idea of the content of this book, below please find what the twenty one great ways are (available in both contents and conclusion pages):-<br /><br />1. Set the table (goal setting)<br /><br />2. Plan everyday in advance<br /><br />3. Apply the 80/20 rule to everything<br /><br />4. Consider the sequences<br /><br />5. Practice the ABCDE Method continually (rating and prioritizing)<br /><br />6. Focus on key result areas<br /><br />7. Obey the Law of Forced Efficiency (do the most important first)<br /><br />8. Prepare thoroughly before you begin<br /><br />9. Do your homework<br /><br />10. Leverage your special talents<br /><br />11. Identify you key contraints<br /><br />12. Take it one oil barrel at a time<br /><br />13. Put the pressure on yourself<br /><br />14. Maximize your personal powers<br /><br />15. Motivate yourself into action<br /><br />16. Practice creative procrastination<br /><br />17. Do the most difficult task first<br /><br />18. Slive and dice the task<br /><br />19. Create large chunks of time<br /><br />20. Develop a sense of urgency<br /><br />21. Single handle every task<br /><br />As you may see, some ways or chapters do overlap. However, the book is not that repetitive and it's a fun read with the author's excellent writing skill. In case you just want a short and interesting book (the title is great) that focuses on procrastination with less coverage of time and life management, this is it. Nevertheless, a drawback may be that many ideas here had been presented in the author's previous books. (I had read three Tracy books before this) Anyway, wish you all tasty frog (things that you keep procrastinating) meals! Enjoy!
B0002CTSW2|5.0|This is the most passionate, and vivid interpretation of the Gospels that has ever been put on film. You can hate it or love it, but you can't deny what it is. Yes, there were a few things I was a little unhappy with, but the overall effect of the film does not lie, or waste time for that matter. It does what it's there to do. Any non-believers can be offended by it for doing what it set out to do, if you want films that are wishy-washy and can't manage to stick to a point, this isn't the film for you. Of course it's controversial! Of course people hate it! But then, for a &quot;disgusting&quot; film, it did rack up, what... $600mil at the BO? Well deserved for Mel Gibson's refusal to compromise in a world that wants him to. You can't dispute that, this film deserves respect, not arrogance.
1401300901|5.0|I whipped through the book in no time and was very sad to put it down! I loved it!
068987474X|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down. I'm the relationships book queen -- I'm sure I've devoured over a hundred titles -- and this is BAR NONE the very best I've ever seen. I could throw the other books away, all of them, because this one absolutely speaks the truth. It's also one of the most entertaining reads I've seen in a long, long time, and I say that as a fellow successful television writer. I've bought 4 copies for my single girlfriends. Hats off to Greg and Liz. A stunning achievement!
1591840562|5.0|Love this book. Kawasaki once again demonstrates an uncanny ability to cut to the chase, serving up wisdom that is as easily digested as it is right on the money. <br /> <br />Whether you're a first-time entrepreneur starting from scratch, or someone who wants to rediscover the entrepreneurial spirit while working in the confines of a big company, this book is a must read -- and one that can be consumed in just a few hours. <br /> <br />It's funny, insightful, sensitive, self-deprecating at times and most of all, loaded with great tips. The sections on positioning, branding and public speaking were, in my opinion, the highlights of a book that is full of highlights. <br /> <br />I've only had it for a short while and it's already dog-eared and beaten up. <br /> <br />Two thumbs up -- way up.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005A8MA|5.0|I must say i waited for years for this one to re-appear.   The album contained the finest selection of musicians to be collected under one roof.  Mick Taylor is in exceptional form especially on \\"Marriage Madness\\". This session was almost like a continuation for Taylor from his previous gem of a recording with Mayall (i.e. \\"Crusade\\") Sugarcane Harris's electric violin  added a truly cutting edge to the whole session. Eric Clapton plays on several tracks.   Listen to \\"Unanswered Questions\\". I searched for this song everywhere whilst \\"Back to the Roots\\" remained a deleted album. This track contains a mindbending guitar solo by the masterful Harvey Mandel. Sugarcane's violin wails also on this psychedelically funky minor blues. Great lyrics for this song especially during the times we live in today.   If you were young in 1970 then you'd relate to the scene that this album generates.      Buy this one before it's deleted again!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Went and saw this at the theaters.  I, like most people in the south, had personally said bad things about Mr. Moore after his comments receiving his oscar awhile back.  After seeing this movie I told my wife that I felt like a fool for \\"badmouthing\\" him and for voting Republican all my life.  I had formed my opinion about Mr. Moore based on media comments and political feelings.  Now I am one of his biggest fans!  I just bought \\"Bowling for Columbine\\".  It is also great.  I am changing.  My views about so many things are changing thanks to Mr. Moore's insight and honesty.  I have checked out his claims in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Maybe a few minor points can be argued but all in all it's true.  Just visited my 76 year old Republican mother, and she was badmouthing Mr. Moore.  I asked her why?  She said because he's telling lies.  I asked her how does she know that?  She said it's all over the media.  I tried to convince her otherwise.  We'll see.
B0002DB52M|1.0|If I could have given 0 stars I would have. This has got to be the worse movie I have ever rented. AWFUL!!!!!
B00009V7RF|4.0|B.E.P. had a drastic change with the addition of Fergie and her addition is indeed a \\"plus\\" to them. Her vocals are really striking and perfectly blends with the group. <br /> <br />The album is a mix of rap, dance & catchy esoteric songs with a hint of ballad added into the soup. <br /> <br />The hidden track, \\"The Elephunk Theme\\" is a plus, except with Taboo's constant & irritating \\"make noise\\" shouting that does drown out the catchy & melodic Indian song. If these were a live performance, I would probably have shouted to him to \\"Shut Up!\\" \\"Shut Up\\" is another great classic with Fergie's vocals. <br /> <br />The saddest & heart-warming song is probably the \\"APL song\\". A complete turn-around from the rest of the tracks. It's moral is very simple: appreciate what you have, strive to live and be thankful for the opportunites granted to you because not everyone is granted the same. <br /> <br />\\"Where Is The Love\\", a popular & classic song ends the album on a high note. Other reviewers have accused the lyrics of being simplistic and trite. Unfortunately, when you ask the same reviewers to do something better, they come up even shorter than a toe nail.  <br /> <br />I won't go much into the dance tunes as they seem fine to me but not that excellent. <br /> <br />As a side note: \\"Hands Up\\" is one of the songs included in the tracks for \\"NBA Live 2004\\" from EA Sports. <br /> <br />A good album that doesn't disappoint. But... it could have been better. <br /> <br />- The A.C.E.
B00013RC9I|3.0|I'd liked it, but I have an embarrasing weakness for the sort of synth-pop they use in the movies to invoke feeling of loneliness.  You know, the kind of gentle, semi-futuristic, electronia stuff that usually accompanies a fly over of the big city at night. <br /> <br />My only complaint is when the band does their own vocals.  They can't sing very well, and the high pitched french accent with the unsophisticated lyrics turns me off a bit.  I'm sure it's not the case, but their singing makes it hard not to assume there's some homosexual undertones, particularly on songs with titles like \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\".
B000000JO3|5.0|You should be happy that your kid is listening to Minor Threat instead of, say, Limp Bizkit. The lyrics are socially responsible. Isn't that what you want your kid to be? As for the language, your kid probably uses the words in the songs anyways, so you can't protect them. The album is definatly one of the best punk rock album ever. It's better than \\"Nevermind the Bullocks\\" by a thousand miles! It changed my life, and it will most likely change your's. The music and lyrics are encredibly powerful and rocking. I hate kids who think KoRn or Limp Bizkit are hardcore. This is hardcore.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|\\"Cloud Nine\\" (1987) represented a major comeback for George Harrison and his finest solo effort since \\"All Things Must Pass\\" (1970). \\"Got My Mind Set On You,\\" \\"When We Was Fab,\\" \\"This Is Love\\" and \\"That's What It Takes\\" are classic Harrison tracks.  The musicianship is superb throughout, with memorable contributions from Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Elton John. In terms of bonus tracks, \\"Zig Zag\\" (a 1987 B-side) is an unheralded gem. \\"Cloud Nine\\" may lack the epic grandeur of \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" but it remains Harrison's most pleasurable album.
0743243307|3.0|My great aunt initially suggested Brick Lane to me and I now can see how the generation gap made a big difference to the way in which we reacted to the story. While she told me it was magnificent I found the story only mediocre. I expected a new Memoirs of a Geisha, yet I did not grow as attached to the main character or become as enthralled in her story. The story did not really pick up until the last 70 or so pages. The first half of the book attempted to set up the rest of the novel, but a lot of the things learned during this time were unhelpful. Ali made a big deal about the letters written between the sisters, however I felt that that aspect did not bring much to the book and I felt myself groan each time I saw the italicized letters which signaled the start of a letter series. However, the book did have some redeeming moments. It was often the slightest of comments that were the most insightful and gave me the most respect and sympathy for Nazneen. The end of the novel, while slightly anticlimactic, was satisfying in that the women were able to find their own life paths and create more opportunities for themselves.
B000002OX5|5.0|Unlike some concept albums which came out in the Sixties, this one still sounds solid and fresh today, with only a handful of songs that sound psychedelic (\\"Relax,\\" \\"Armenia City in the Sky,\\" and \\"ICSFM,\\" the first Who song I can remember having heard).  A lot of older fans say the concept kind of fizzled out about halfway through the original album, but with the bonus tracks and adverts, it keeps the concept on track throughout.  And unlike the non-concept of the most overrated album of all time (a band giving a concert, ooh how original), this concept is actually original, being a spoof on the pirate radio stations in London of the time.  And even though it originally may have fizzled out about halfway through, at least the majority of the songs actually relate to the concept, instead of only having three that do so (like in the most overrated album of all time's case).  (Though why couldn't \\"Rael 2\\" have been squeezed onto the original vinyl?  It gives a sense of final closure to the gorgeous \\"Rael.\\")  It's also interesting to note that, on the original release, Roger only sang lead on six of the thirteen songs (and only four of the bonus tracks, plus \\"Glow Girl,\\" where he trades verses with Pete).  Some people think this is so because his range was still developing at this time and he couldn't hit all of the right notes in all of the songs.  (I've also seen it postulated that Kit Lambert did this because he was trying to defrock him of his masculinity; such a claim is so illogical and unrealistic it's laughable.)<br /><br />This album has a little taste of everything--soft sweet ballads like \\"Sunrise,\\" psychedelic songs like \\"Armenia City in the Sky\\" (some fans don't even think that any of the bandmembers are singing on that song; it's hard to tell just whose voice it is with all of the psychedelic distortion, but I very much doubt that Speedy Keene, its writer, or anyone else for that matter would have been singing the first song on their third album!), cute funny adverts like \\"Heinz Baked Beans,\\" fun happy pop like \\"Maryanne with the Shaky Hands,\\" dark songs like \\"Melancholia,\\" and even songs which later had some of their components recycled into 'Tommy,' like \\"Glow Girl\\" and \\"Rael.\\"  I'm with the people who speculate that \\"Rael\\" is really about IsRAEL, given some of the verses in the song (\\"my heritage is threatened, my roots are torn and quartered,\\" \\"Rael, the home of my religion, to me the centre of the earth,\\" and \\"like a goldfish being swallowed by a whale,\\" for example).  It also came out the year of the Six-Day War; gives one something to think about.  Of course, the beautiful hauting instrumental refrain of the later \\"Sparks\\" and \\"Underture\\" were pulled right from \\"Rael,\\" and in the final song on the remaster, \\"Glow Girl,\\" we hear the genesis of 'Tommy' in the final lines (\\"It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl\\"), \\"only Tommy was a dear little boy.\\"  From a horrific plane crash comes rebirth and the genesis of something very powerful and beautiful.funny adverts like \\"Heinz Baked Beans,\\" fun happy pop like \\"Maryanne with the Shaky Hands,\\" dark songs like \\"Melancholia,\\" and even songs which later had some of their components recycled into 'Tommy,' like \\"Glow Girl\\" and \\"Rael.\\"  I'm with the people who speculate that \\"Rael\\" is really about IsRAEL, given some of the verses in the song (\\"my heritage is threatened, my roots are torn and quartered,\\" \\"Rael, the home of my religion, to me the centre of the earth,\\" and \\"like a goldfish being swallowed by a whale,\\" for example).

0375432302|4.0|This book contains the unexpected; it is an ingeniously multilayered pedigree, unfolding mysteries hidden beneath codes and challenges and fueled by dualism in pitch and cleverness.  The uncovering of the ultimate mystery is liken to the arduous process of removing worthless layers corrupting an original masterpiece... tedious and unpromising... and yet intense, electrifying, and most importantly, satisfying when closing in on the final result.  Let's just hope that your knowledge of church history is a little better than mine.
B000002J09|5.0|Hey losers if you don't like Led Zeppelin's 4th album don't buy it. I love it. It shows how the band continued to evolve during their years together. The Album has great songs on it. Stairway To Heaven IS one of the best songs EVER.By the way it's NOT titled 'IV', 'Runes', 'Symbols', or 'ZOSO'. Led Zeppelin said when it was released and surviving members still say now IT IS \\"UNTITLED\\" THEIR IS NO NAME FOR IT. The only thing to do is call it their 4th ablum. Don't try to name it
B00008J2DQ|3.0|\\"Faceless\\" was the first Godsmack CD that I bought, and at first I thought it was great. Then I got the self-titled debut, and realized that Godsmack really lost it. One of the mian things that I see wrong with \\"Faceless\\" now is that there's hardly any variety in the songs! If you listen to only one, it sounds great, but then when you listen to the entire CD, the songs start sounding the same. The reason for this, I believe, is that Shannon Larkin's ride cymbal is too over-powering. It's being played almost constantly during the opening guitar riffs of many of the songs, and it takes a lot away from the guitars. You can't hear the heaviness of the songs as well as you might have been able to. Eventually, though, if you work hard enough, you start hearing the differences and it gets a lot better. Unfortunately, many people might not give this CD a second listen after hearing how similar everything sounds. For those of you that don't give up right away, this album does become pretty good. The songs and my reviews for each are: <br /> <br />1.) Straight Out Of Line (10/10): The war sounds in the beginning are pretty cool. The opening drumming is the best anywhere on the album- it's just amazing. It remains great throughout. When the music starts, it sounds like the guitars are swirling around you as Sully yells in your face. It makes for a good song and a great opener. Tony solos the hell out of his guitar towards the end. The lyrics are chorus are pretty good. <br /> <br />2.) Faceless (8/10): Not as good as \\"Straight Out Of Line,\\" but still decent. The guitar's really chugging loudly on this song, and, along with the drumming, make this one of the heavier tracks. Once again, great lyrics and guitars all the way through, especially the solo in the middle. It's too bad a lot of the later songs don't have that... <br /> <br />3.) Changes (7/10): Another mediocre song. It's not great, but it's not bad either. Nothing really stands out on this track, but the lyrics are pretty good. Other than that, there's nothing all that special. <br /> <br />4.) Make Me Believe (10/10): My second favorite on the whole album. The opening guitar riff is amazing, as are the vocals. I especially like the chorus. The drumming is second only to that on \\"Straight Out Of Line.\\" From about 2:24-3:00 is great, because Sully slows it down and shows off his singing voice. \\"Make Me Believe\\" is just an amazing song all the way through. <br /> <br />5.) I Stand Alone (7/10): This song's nothing too special. You listen to it once and forget it, twice and you're tired of it. But who knows, maybe a lot of people will like it. <br /> <br />6.) Re-Align (10/10): My third favorite on the CD. The guitar riff is great, and this is one of the faster songs. Excellent lyrics and chorus. It's obvious why they decided to add this to \\"The Other Side,\\" Godsmack's acoustic CD. As with \\"Make Me Believe,\\" it's great all the way through, though it's not as heavy as some songs. <br /> <br />7.) I F***ing Hate You (2/10): Ugh. This song is boring and tiring. The lyrics and anger sound too forced, and this track is probably why \\"Faceless\\" got a Parental Advisory slapped on it. It tries to be heavy but it's not, it tries to be angry but it's anything but, and it tries not to be forgotten quickly but it is. Seriously though, the lyrics are terrible! It's kind of sad that they even decided to make a song like this...   <br /> <br />8.) Releasing The Demons (10/10): From the title, you would suspect that this song would sound scarier and stranger than it really does. The guitar riff is great, and there is some creepiness to the lyrics, but with name like Releasing The Demons, you'd expect something more. Great chorus though, and I like the start-and-stop of the guitars towards the end. <br /> <br />9.) Dead And Broken (6/10): As with \\"Changes\\" and \\"I Stand Alone,\\" there's nothing too special about this song, and it's forgotten pretty quickly. I really don't even remember anything aboutit, even though I just listened to it!  <br /> <br />10.) I Am (10/10): Great guitars, lyrics, and drumming. This song is one of my favorites. It's one of the few tracks that has a really noticeable difference from everything else. All in all, a pretty good track. <br /> <br />11.) The Awakening (5/10): This \\"song\\" is basically just tribal drums with some guy chanting in the background. At just over a minute, I'm guessing it's a prelude to \\"Serenity,\\" like \\"The Journey\\" was to \\"Spiral\\" on Awake. In my opinion, it's really just filler, but I gave it 5 out 10 because it's good filler. <br /> <br />12.) Serenity (10/10): My favorite song on the entire album. It's the first Godsmack song I ever heard, and it remains my favorite. \\"Serenity\\" is entirely acoustic, but it's still a great song, with amazing drumming and bass. What else can I say but WOW! You must go and listen to this song to see what I mean. <br /> <br />OVERALL: 95/120, 79.2%  3 out of 5 stars <br /> <br />This album's not bad if you get used to it. I mainly bought it for the song \\"Serenity,\\" and I eventually began liking the rest of it. I would reccomend you buy the self-titled debut first though.
0812550706|5.0|This is where it all begins.  A young boy has been genetically sculpted to have the ideal characteristics to ... save the world.  He is calm; he is courageous; he is dispassionate; he is empathetic; he is ruthless.  He, along with a hundred-some boys and girls, is selected to wage the war that men and women are too sensible to wage.  Only children (goes the reasoning) have the right balance of daring and ignorance necessary to win the war. <br /> <br />Men are the good guys.  Buggers are the enemy.  The heart and soul of one boy has been chosen to take the beating for the fate of millions. <br /> <br />Ender Wiggin is that boy. <br /> <br />The popularity of Ender's Game is the popularity of Everyman, or Hamlet, but through the lens of science fiction.  The weight of high expectations is a common experience, as is the guilt of having inflicted unwitting pain.  The love of sister, the love of friend, the hate of enemy, the love and hate of self -- these are the basic truths of our existence.  Orson Scott Card was just wise enough, and just reckless enough, to write this thrill of a novel over twenty years ago. <br /> <br />This writer will never tire of reading it.
0802130208|4.0|This book has one of the most memorable characters that you will ever have the opportunity of meeting; all that you really need to know is that its probably the only Pulitzer Prize winning novel that wonderfully glorifies belching and ravenous hot dog (\\"weenies\\"!) consumption.    Two of the reasons to read this book are Toole's amazing wordplay and of course, Reilly himself. Toole can spin some truly hilarious imagery and I assure you, there are inspired scenes from this book that will just dance in your head. Images of Reilly will be waddling around in your mind, long after you finish the story. The story becomes almost secondary to Reilly, and its ok in this case, because he's funny, bombastic and mesmerizing enough to carry you all the way to the end. Each page is brimming with his scathing wit. There is not much more to praise that hasn't been said already, so go give this book a shot.     I would have given the book 5 stars, but could not because there are moments of tedium, if only because the other characters on which Toole focuses are not nearly as engaging or excellent as Reilly. And it is precisely at these moments, when the story shifts to another character, where the story does lag a bit.     However, despite that, Toole's writing crackles and propels you to finish. Reilly is an inspired creation and Toole provides sentences of sheer literary pleasure and hilarity - every insult, diatribe and idea crafted by an extremely talented wordsmith. Go get acquainted with them!
0399103422|4.0|The movie is taken almost verbatium from the book so reading the book after watching the movie, I found myself skimming past half the book. There is some material not covered in the movie but not much.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the few albums where I liked EVERY song. Their style was consistent throughout without each song sounding the same.  At the same time, they offered new ideas and arrangements on each track. Good for dancing or just listening.  It is a shame they never had a follow-up album.<br /><br />If you like this album--try the CRUXSHADOWS. Their new album Ethernaut has similar themes and sound, but with a male vocal lead instead of female.
0898705525|5.0|A great book even for its literary excellence alone. I don't understand why his guy isn't required reading in schools.  CS's Lewis' Mere Christianity is probably the most popular English-language Christian book, outside the Bible. But before Mere Christianity, there was Orthodoxy and I would recommend it over Mere Christianity any day.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I have watched Mask quite a few times over the years.  Everytime I catch it on tv, I will watch it, partly because the acting of Cher and Eric Stoltz in this movie is amazing.  The story is also solid gold.  A disfigured boy named Rocky Dennis has to deal with his drug-using mom played by Cher, the pain of his disease, and the struggle of trying to fit in with the \\"normal\\" crowd in high school.  The character of Rocky Dennis is kind, smart, and creative.  If you watch this film, you will love this kid by the time the credits roll, or before.  Eric Stoltz should have won an oscar for his acting in Mask.  Watch his body language, he is full of hope, and sadness.  His acting trancends anything a coventional drama could offer.   <br />  The Director's cut is a little different than the theatrical release, with around four fantastic deleted scenes thrown back in, and the musical score that Peter Bogdanovich wanted all along, Bruce Springsteen.  While I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen,(the Bob Segar score is what I'm used to) It sounds good.  Universal has really done it up for this release.  You get an audio commentary by Bogdanovich, and also a twenty minute feature on the origins of Mask.  Did I mention it's in DTS?  There are movies to rent, and movies to own.  This one belongs in your dvd collection.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Hype, oh yeah! <br />Left wing nut case...maybe. <br />But after watching this film the one thing that pervades is that there are a bunch of powerful people sending a bunch of lower class (statistically speaking) people to war. <br />People have said to me its a funny, informative, indictment of a film,  I did not  <br />perceive it that way at all! <br />The times I was maipulated to laugh leftist like, I was stone faced and agog. <br />Being manipulated by Michael Moore is not a fun experience at all. And yes this is manipulation on a biblical scale! <br />I felt such remorse and contempt for the idiot neo-Con artists that fomented this war. <br />I commend Michael Moore for being the pit bull he is for getting this film out and into the theaters. Showing us the war that the media has been fearful to show us. I Still think it was more of a diversion than a war. <br />I dont agree with many of the conclusions that Michael Moore implies. <br />The world is safer without Sadam. <br />But what has the US created by removing the controling element from a region rife with ethnic hostility and religious ferver. <br />Iraq has evolved into a \\"I hate the US\\" recruitement film. Yeah, you deluded repubs feels safer....idiots! <br />Informative, but bring your reality goggles with you. Moore points out some of the scummy elements that this war has somehow buried. <br />Haliburton. <br />Cheney. <br />Oil. <br />Not voting Repub alias Neo-Con-artist this year.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|What a great cast - Eve Arden with the smart quips, Jack Carsen as likeable know-it-all trying to score points with Mildred, Zachary Scott as the duplicitous lover (he was also in another Crawford film, Flamingo Road) and of course Joan Crawford in her Academy Award winning role trying to cope with her daughter (Ann Blyth) as a single parent and gain financial independence.  This is a beautiful, sharp black and white film.  Extras on this dvd are a feature-length documentary about Joan Crawford narrated by Angelica Huston and trailers from 6 of Crawford's films with Warners.
B000268QB2|5.0|\\"Hopes and Fears\\" is simply an excellent album from start to finish, and honestly no amount of comparisons can take away from that. I have heard a great deal of music from the bands that Keane supposedly is being so derivative of. Bands such as Colplay, Travis, and Radiohead are all great in their own right, but the insistent need that some people seem to feel for reducing \\"Hopes and Fears\\" to a mere copycat album of other British bands that have come before is based off an inability to appreciate Keane for what they're amazingly good at - writing some of the most catchy, powerful, sweeping and honest feeling songs to come out in popular music in a long while. Though many will disagree with me, their ability to write a great tune with true sincerity tops the bands they've been compared to on many occasions, or at least rivals them. Keane are their own band, complete with their own sound, and their genuine attitude - so free from the pretension that saturates so much other music - is refreshing and has restored my faith in being able to find great new bands. <br /> <br />While one could attribute the album's excellent clarity and sound solely to the top-notch production work, I am here to say that since seeing Keane in concert (frankly, the best show I've ever been to), I have realized that the band is just as capable - if not moreso - of creating energetic, emotional, and highly talented musicianship in a live setting as they are in the studio. In both cases, they truly know how to flesh out their sound and create a full band sound with just three members - a singer, drummer, and pianist. <br /> <br />Tom Chaplin's vocals are some of the best in music today. The way he sings \\"She Has No Time\\", for instance, truly can send chills up one's spine. He has great range, complete with a stunning falsetto. Tim Rice-Oxley's piano work is absolutely gorgeous also, and Richard Hughes' drumming gives the music a very strong backbone. The trio make a highly effective team. <br /> <br />The main thing that I appreciate about \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is how purely melodic it is. Great pop/rock music is not just about writing a catchy hook. You don't want just a song that will get stuck in your head on repeat, incessantly annoying you - instead it's truly about the kind of melody, the kind of enduring beauty of music that gets stuck in your heart and mind and leaves an impact on you. To me, Keane has accomplished this with their music on nearly every track on the album. (Perhaps with the exception of \\"Untitled 1\\", which while creative and an interesting different sort of listen, didn't quite catch on with me as well for whatever reason). <br /> <br />I truly hope Keane will come to garner the kind of respect they deserve, as a great band on their own right, and not some Coldplay/Radiohead/Travis rip-off. I suggest this album to anyone looking for something unique, genuine, and highly melodic. Though, I love all the tracks on the album, \\"Everybody's Changing\\" is my favorite and one I strongly recommend for someone interested in trying out a song from the album to see if it's to their liking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|I want to address the criticism that the movie is anti-semitic. As a Christian who grew up knowing the gospel account of the crucifixion, I have always known that in the Garden of Gethsemene (the first scene in the movie) Jesus made the choice to do the will of the Father--made the choice to go to the cross.  But I have never thought about what I so clearly saw in \\"The Passion\\"--that any time during his suffering, Jesus could have chosen to put a stop to what was going on.  His mother's words, spoken after she had watched her son suffering for a very long time, revealed that to me in a way that I had never realized: \\"My son, when are you going to put a stop to all of this?\\"  I do not hold the Jews responsible for the death of Jesus.  Any group of people could have stood in their place.  And most importantly, Jesus chose to suffer, in order to fulfill the purpose of his coming to the earth.  I think that Mel Gibson made that very clear.
0385510438|4.0|I read this book on a 15 hour airplane trip.  I have read 3-4 other early Grisham novels, and I much prefer this novel.  This is not a novel for suspense - even though the back cover tries to advertise it as such.  It is a coming of age story set within a small southern town in the 1970's.  I found the novel's protagonist, college dropout Willie Traynor, especially likable, and enjoyed seeing him mature as the story progressed.  While some of the characters may be slightly underdeveloped and appear stereotyped, I don't believe this impacted much on the story.   <br /> <br />The ending was a bit disappointing, but not because it was predictable.  The ending didn't do justice to the great character Grisham had painstakingly developed.  Not that I was looking for Willie to have an epiphany, but I would have appreciated more exploration of how Willie dealt with the final events in the book.  As a result, the ending felt rushed. <br /> <br />Overall, if you like coming of age stories this Grisham novel would be a great read.   <br /> <br />Incidentally, this book is one of the few Grisham novels that I think could be made into a decent movie. <br />
B00004W52U|5.0|This is a punk rock classic.  Just do yourself a favor and go out and listen to this album.  Socially conscious ska/punk,  every song is a pleaser.<br /><br />  This album helped me to get through high school, and I still listen to it, at 24. It is one of those albums that just grows better with time.  Very positive, and motivating, and thought provoking. These songs are upbeat yet still maintain an edge.  Proves you don't have to be apathetic to be cool, because these guys were far from apathetic and they were very cool.  Lint is now Tim Armstrong from Rancid.<br /><br />  If you like high energy punk or ska, or even if you don't think you do, just give this album a try, I guarantee it will change your life.
B0000666DW|4.0|This album sounds like Art.  I would have given it 5 stars had I written this review Before hearing \\"Leviathan,\\" but that album is so much better sounding that by contrast, this is four stars.  Both are incredible, as is Mastodon.  A lovely young woman I have the joy of working with introduced me to these guys, so I've only been a fan a short time, but so far its all been an incredible experience.  I can't say they're my favorite, but at the moment, of all the Metal bands I've been listening to lately, these guys are on top.  They're not just loud, they have a style that is quite unique; and their lyrics are an usual bunch.  In both \\"Remission\\" and \\"Leviathan\\" I'm noticing a pattern to what the songs are about, if they are about anything...which is good. It is Poetry in the form of Heavy Metal, and they pull it off magically.  Musically I can't say much, as I am not a musician.  All I can do is bring about the old cliche phrase: <br /> <br />\\"I may not know (metal), but I know what I like...and I like this.\\"
0790729652|4.0|One would think that comic books would be extremely easy to adapt, if the visual effects technology is up to the task.  However, the vast majority of films made from comic book sources are terrible.  It is not the fault of the comic book creators.  Many of their stories from the past 25 years (or so) have great dialouge, complex characters and memorable plots.  The comics themselves are very like movie story-boards.<br /><br />And yet, film-makers all too often choose to remove the best elements of the source material and replace it with very weak content.<br /><br />The first two \\"Batman\\" films are near the top of a very short list of exceptions. While the finished film was a step down from its own utterly brilliant trailer, Batman is still very watchable today.  Michael Keaton actually plays Bruce Wayne as a human being.  He is depressed, distracted and clearly troubled.  Jack Nicholson is clearly great as the Joker. He does not play the pre-accident version of the character any differently, but that is a quibble after several viewings.  The supporting cast is mostly excellent, except pointless Robert Wuhl.<br /><br />Tim Burton creates a total world that enables these extreme characters to make dramatic sense.  He doesn't even nod at 'realism'.  Rather, he borrows from German Expressionism and its cousin Film Noir to create a fake world that has its own rules.  Anton Furst brings a brilliant production design to the film that has influenced every design of a comic book film since.<br /><br />Even the script is pretty good.  The story is fairly faithful to the source material and the one-liners are mostly funny.  That is about all you can ask from a big summer movie.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I'm quite new to Godspeed, but, thus far, I am impressed by what they do with their &#34;moods&#34; in each of these three LONG songs.  I mostly bought this one for the 'East Hastings' track, which was taken off of the '28 Days Later' Soundtrack for some reason...hmmm.  I've never felt so low in my life when I first started off the first track...It will take me some time to get use to this kind of music.  I call this CD a beautiful depression because, that's obviouslly the mood of the entire CD through the intro commentary's from one of the members of Godspeed (&#34;and the machine was bleeding to death&#34;) and how they talk about the end of the world in their beginning and outro commentary's.  'F#A# (Infinity Symbol)' --&#62; help support these guys since they don't have a lot of money...don't have your friends burn the CD's by them for you, help them out and go buy some of their stuff.  That's my review, thanks!
B00005QG9J|5.0|In the past, Incubus has been known to play music that combines funk and metal to create a distinct style of music.  Recently, the band started to move towards an even more melodic sound with their album Make Yourself and continued this transition with their album Morning View.  Morning View starts off hard with \\"Nice to Know You\\" and finishes with a very mellow \\"Aqueous Transmission.\\"  The difference between these two songs illustrates the evolution of Incubus's music.  Incubus has become versatile in their music and can play anything from calm, melodic songs for a time of meditation to hard rock songs that make you want to move around.  This growth as a band can be seen in certain members of the band. <br /> <br /> The most noticeable growth in the band can be heard in the guitar method.  Michael Einziger's ability as a guitar player has grown immensely.  Back in the days of Fungus Amongus the guitar was mostly funk with a metal twist to it.  In Morning View he plays anything from hard rock in \\"Under My Umbrella\\" to acoustic melodies in \\"Mexico.\\"  What DJ Kilmore does on the turntables accompanies Einziger's work perfectly.  He doesn't get too hip hop and take away from Einziger's melodies, instead the sounds sampled work with the guitar and make the songs more melodic.  Who wouldn't like a band that can make turntables and a guitar work together and make a sound that isn't hip hop or nu-metal? <br /> <br />The one thing that sets Incubus apart from other bands that have turntables is Brandon Boyd's voice.  His voice is distinct and this is partly because he can sing different many ways.  In Fungus Amongus Boyd's voice went with the funk-metal and had a funk sound to it.  Now that the band plays both funk-metal and melodic songs Boyd's voice has grown to be able to sing melodic and funky.  A lot of the melody of the songs on Morning View comes from Boyd's calm, yet fiery voice.  With Boyd's voice, Einziger's guitar, and Kilmore's turntables the band has grownto a band that has no specific genre. <br /> <br /> Overall this album is a great one because it incorporates some of the harder sounds of Incubus (as in \\"Have You Ever?\\" and \\"Under My Umbrella\\") and some of their melodic sounds (as in \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" and \\"Mexico\\").  If you are an Incubus fan this album may seem like a let down at first because it is less hard than their other albums, but if you give it time this will soon be one of your favorite Incubus albums. <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|Ok, sure there is a new director and he changed a lot of things around that I did not particulary accept, This one was different and I enjoyed a change from the first two, which were more on the ACTION side of things.  I liked the fact that the director brought out more emotions from the characters, Hermione had more of an attitude and they brought out a dramatic side to Harry which shows how they are when they truly take things seriouslly.  You really have to use your imagination and have the complete knowledge of the novel as well if you really want to understand the whole concept of the movie itself...If you have not read the book, you will not understand what's going on, especially when the part where Harry and friends meet up with Sirius Black in the Shrieking Shack under the Whomping Willow outside of Hogwarts.  A lot of people said they were very dissapointed by how the whole movie was in general, but I enjoyed how the movie was different from the first two.  It's a sign of the things to come in the next installments from the popular novels by J.K. Rowling to whoever directs the next HP movie.  That's my review, thanks!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Right then.  If you're like me, you hate when soundtracks come out missing your favorite songs.  Of course, it's next to impossible to include all the songs in a movie on a soundtrack but you hope for the best.  \\"Love Actually\\" comes close.  But for you ... uh ... Soundtrackaphiles like me, you can't sleep till you HAVE IT ALL!  So here is a complete list of the tracks in Love Actually in the order they appear (hopefully).  I'm missing a few untitled instrumental pieces used by Craig Armstrong (brilliant!).<br /><br />First ... in the trailer (and this always bugs me when they don't use the trailer songs in the film) are the following:<br /><br />1. I Want You Back - The Jackson 5<br /><br />2. Good Vibrations - The Beach Boys<br /><br />3. (untitled Craig Armstrong music)<br /><br />4. This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) - Natalie Cole<br /><br />The soundtrack itself:<br /><br />1. Christmas is All Around - Billy Mack<br /><br />2. All You Need is Love - Lynden David Hall<br /><br />3. Take Me As I Am - Wyclef Jean<br /><br />4. Bye Bye Baby - Bay City Rollers<br /><br />5. Puppy Love - S. Club Juniors<br /><br />6. Sweetest Goodbye - Maroon 5<br /><br />7. Glasgow Love Theme - Craig Armstrong<br /><br />8. All I Want For Christmas - Tessa Niles<br /><br />9. I'll See It Through - Texas<br /><br />10. River - Joni Mitchell<br /><br />11. Jump - The Pointer Sisters<br /><br />12. Here With Me - Dido<br /><br />13. Rose - James Horner \\"from Titanic Soundtrack\\"<br /><br />14. The Trouble With Love - Kelly Clarkson<br /><br />15. Like I Love You - Justin Timberlake<br /><br />16. Turn Me On - Norah Jones<br /><br />17. Songbird - Eva Cassidy<br /><br />18. All Alone On Christmas - Darlene Love<br /><br />19. Smooth - Santana/Rob Thomas<br /><br />20. Wherever You Will Go - The Calling<br /><br />21. Both Sides Now - Joni Mitchell<br /><br />22. White Christmas - Otis Redding<br /><br />23. (\\"Jump\\" reprise)<br /><br />24. All I Want For Christmas Is You - Olivia Olson<br /><br />25. God Only Knows - The Beach Boys<br /><br />26. The Trouble With Love (reprise for credits)<br /><br />27. Too Lost In You - Sugababes (credits).<br /><br />There you go.  Hope that helps.  A few more things.  Craig Armstrong uses mainly three pieces of music:  1. Glasgow Love Theme, 2. PM Love Theme and 3. Portuguese Love Theme ... these are used interchangeably throughout the film.  You can find them online if you look hard.<br /><br />One more thing for you extremists:  On the DVD Audio Commentary, Richard Curtis says he, in place of \\"God Only Knows\\" was going to use \\"The Loving\\" by XTC but didn't.  So if you want, find that song too.<br /><br />Happy listening!(credits). <br /> <br />There you go.  Hope that helps.  A few more things.  Craig Armstrong uses mainly three pieces of music:  1.

B00005JMAH|1.0|This film is such a disappointment. There are scenes in it that have no point and apparently they found those scenes more important than Harry finding out that his father, Black, lupin, and Pettigrew made the marauder's map or that Gryffindor finally won the quidditch cup (first time in at least 7 years). This movie blows.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Let me first offer my reactions to the film itself.  I could write a lengthy response to all of the controversary concerning the film's violence, possible anti-semitism, and possible reinterpretation of the story, but I will instead focus on the positive.  As a college student who studies, among other things, theology and philosophy, I attended this film with the intention to view it with a critical eye, as I knew that it was from a critical standpoint that I would be required to discuss it.  This I was able to do through the beating before the Sanhedron, the whipping at the post, the crown of thorns, and the beginning of the Way of the Cross.  However, my emotions (as a devout Catholic) overcame me at the First Fall when Mary, having a flashback to Jesus stumbling as a child, runs to comfort Him.  For just a moment, the story ceases to be about the Saviour and the Saved, and it is about a Mother and her Son.  It was this moment, when I thought about my own mother, that my eyes finally filled with tears.  The performance of Jim Caviesal has been much celebrated; in my opionion, however, the best performance of the film belongs to Maia Morgenstern.  She played Mary as a mother dealing with the death of her son - for her, the Divinity of Christ did not matter, she cared only for His humanity.  Her performance was worthy of five stars and more, and it is a pity that, because of the controversy of the film, she may not be nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Award; all things being equal, she would win it hands down.  On her performance alone, this movie deserves 5 stars. <br /> <br />However, I have given it only 3 stars because I am reviewing the DVD release as well.  The complete and total lack of Special Features, be it \\"The Making of...,\\" the Primetime interview, Commentaries, etc., is very disappointing.  I'm very surprised that Mel Gibson did not take the opportunity to expand on the spiritual impact of the film (and perhaps to redeem himself of criticism) byoffering extensive documentaries on The Passion, or a Director's Commentary to trace his own spiritual journey in the film.  I do hope that he will at some point soon offer a DVD with such features.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|well! i have to say, i've been waiting for some band to bring up all the political stuff going on now, and i'm very happy with how it came out, and that it was my favorite band that did it. i've heard a couple of songs that i believe are on the new album, including american idiot, and they all turned out wonderful, and got the point across beautifully. i seriously don't think that the single deserves a parental advisory sticker, i've heard worse, but i think it's because it's so against america, and everything that's happening right now. (i'm not sure who puts the sticker on the cd, but i have a feeling it's something similar to what happened with Farenheit 9/11, if anyone knows.) anyways, i highly recommend this disc, even if it only has two songs on it. i have been counting the days until the full album comes out, and am very happy that this can keep me busy until the 21st!  <br /> <br />and whoever it was that said this album sucked, they can go fall off a cliff, seeing as they're outnumbered, and i say so. ^.^
B000003TA4|3.0|This is a good album but it is not a great album and it really is overrated.   <br /> <br />What happened is Kurt Cobain died and suddenly everthing he touched was supposed to be a masterpeice. Not so. There are only about 5 songs on this album that are truly good and the rest is filler. <br /> <br />I think that it is kinda of a joke to put this album on all time best lists. It's so obvious that the only reason this album is considered a great album is because Cobain was a drug addict and killed himself. While  I do consider him a good stylist and lyricist, this album does not merit any special attention. <br /> <br />Shame on you Rolling Stone magazine. Guess you had to sell magazines or maybe some of your staff and Cobain had the same dealers.
B000002KFJ|5.0|\\"Greatest rock album ever\\" was the opinion of a school buddy of mine way back in the mid-1970s.  I was familiar with several Black Sabbath albums especially We Sold Our Soul For Rock & Roll.  One of the songs on We Sold Our Soul For Rock & Roll was entitled \\"Am I Going Insane\\" and like all the songs on that album it was good.  I read on the cover that Am I Going Insane was originally released on the album, Sabotage.  My friend told me that Am I Going Insane was the \\"worst song on Sabotage.\\"  Aghast, I told him that Am I Going Insane was a good song!  He replied that it sure was a good song, but the other cuts on Sabotage were that much better.  As a result, I saved my pennies and bought an LP copy of Sabotage. <br /> <br />After listening to Sabotage two times, I realized that my friend was right.  It was fantastic!  It was heavy, dark, and full of pain-exactly what you'd expect from Black Sabbath-but they never did it better than this!  From the very first thunder chords of Toni Iommi's guitar on \\"Hole in the Sky,\\" this album takes you on a trip, drugs or no drugs.  (Don't take drugs-just listen to the CD.)  You'll soon realize why Black Sabbath reigns supreme in a genre they virtually invented-heavy metal. <br /> <br />So what's wrong with this album?  I'd say nothing, but I'm a die hard Sabbath fan.  Some people, however, may find some of the teenage male angst embellished with subtle overtones of the occult that this album reflects to be perhaps disturbing.  It's a heavy dose of distorted guitar riffs, anvil-chorus drumming, throbbing bass guitar, and Ozzy's wailing about the downside of life.  If you want sweet, cheerful music typical of The Carpenters you won't get it on Sabotage.  Heavy metal haters need not apply. <br /> <br />But hey-let's not concern ourselves with the critics of heavy rock and roll (I'm getting to be one of them myself:  I only like the older metal).  Just sit down, dawn the headphones, and immerse yourself into the dark, loud, mystical world of Sabotage.  No band ever did it better-no album recorded can beat this one.
0743243315|3.0|Brick Lane is about a woman for Bangladesh who moves to London to marry a man she is arranged to marry and how Nazneen progressively tries to better her live. The book nicely displays Nazeen's development and shows how she grows as a character. In the beginning of the novel Nazeen is very shy, naive, and over powered, but towards the end she becomes much stronger and much more incharge of her live. I very much enjoyed Ali's cunning sense of metaphors, and her play on ideas. Ali has the power to make her audiance physically sense her writing: I could smell the spices and feel Nazneen's disgust when observing Chanu's sloppiness and large gut. In addition to her nice descriptions, Ali wrotie about several things that one could relate to. However, even though the writing was superb, i felt the plot moved too slowly. I felt Ali dawdled too much beforing getting to the heart of the book. It could have easily been half the length of what it was. Even though the climax of the book was thrilling there was too much dead space proceeding it and thus it wasn't a book one couldn't put down. Plus i felt the letters between Nazeen and Hasina were pointless, they didn't at all affect the plot line or the development of any characters. Overall, i felt the book was pretty mediocre, but as i said before the actual text was first-rate.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|There is an old African expression to wish someone a \\"Warm December\\" refering the winter of one's live and its final month.  Ray Charles at the end of his recording career retained the ability to communicate and entertain.  It is not about \\"what was\\" but now.  <br /> <br />I got my album in the mail yesterday and listened to it twice and enjoyed it more the second time; in fact portions that I thought were weak on first hearing had much more depth and feeling that I ever supected on the first go round. <br /> <br />What you get past the past the triump of what is recorded is \\"masterfull\\".   <br /> <br />This is a true duet album with each performer working together. Ray Charles reaches up to Norah Jones key to sell this song.  Elton John sings lower that I'm used to hearing him. <br /> <br />Natalie Cole and Diana Krall amaze.  <br /> <br />One can't alway's go out on top, but one can go out with style and grace.  This recording is proof of that.  <br /> <br />I give it **** and a must have. <br /> <br />This album is a very \\"Warm December\\" a remainer of what was, what has been lost and a blessing to us and for Ray. <br /> <br />Gerald
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Some people here might be asking themselves \\"Why in the heck should we buy a 10 disc set of the 4 Matrix movies?\\"  Well, you should not buy this if your not a hardcore fan and you already have the original DVDs.  This is being released for the more hardcore fans of the matrix.<br /><br />First of all, this is being released because of the extra features and not for the movies directly.  The new commmentary tracks, the dozens of featurettes, and the marketing materials are for all of us hardcore fans that were dissapointed by the lack of special features on the original DVD releases (no commentary tracks, lack of trailers or TV spots, etc).<br /><br />So, you might still be asking yourself if this collection is worth the price of $60.00?  The answer: Yes!  Think about it, if you were to buy all 4 Matrix movies and the Matrix Revisited Documentary in stores you would pay at least $60.00!  For the same price you get a slew of extras, most of which have never been seen!  Once again, this is mainly for the hardcore fans but if you don't have any of the Matrix movies and are thinking about buying the original versions buy this instead!  It has so much more for your money.<br /><br />This is the kind of box set that they should have released right when Revolutions ended.  I'm not complaining though because late is better than never.  The hardcore Matrix fans finally get what they have always wanted.<br /><br />In closing, I would like to repeat that this should probably only be bought by hardcore Matrix fans.  Casual fans would probably be bored with all of the featurettes and think that this was a waste of money.  Still, if your interested in buying the Matrix films individually get this instead.  It will save you money and if you love the Matrix films as much as I do you will be glad that you got this version in the end.
B000069CWE|5.0|Reanimation really ROCKS. If you like LP's rock/hip hop sound then you'll love this. Fresh vocals laid on top of redone tracks makes this a real treat. My personal favs are the beginning of With You with Chester's added scream and 1stp kloser w/jon davis. I also like Rnw@y with the \\"under a sky of grey\\" because you can just know that he did that specifically for this album. <br />My I suggest something to you? If you're REALLY into Linkin Park, join the Linkin Park Underground (LPU). For CHEAP you get access to exclusive media- AUDIO, VIDEO, PHOTOS and more- and you get to buy awesome LP merch like Mike Shinoda's new Remix D.C. skate shoe that he designed. You can only do all this there. And, you get an LP package sent to you in a couple month's time filled with LP goodies including a cd that is ONLY available to LPUers that has cool tracks. <br />If you join, make sure you tell them pointsOfauthority27 sent you!! Put me down in the referral part of your application. And, may I also suggest to you: <br />Hybrid Theory <br />Meteora <br />In the End (a 7 song cd) <br />Live In Texas <br />Frat Party at the Pancake Festival <br />Breaking the Habit dvd/manga <br /> <br />Now, GO BUY THEIR CDS! <br /> <br />
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This 1986 classic starring a much younger Jennifer Connelly and legendary rock star David Bowie is a total delight to watch.<br /><br /> Starring a teenage Connelly as Sara, the movie is the tale of a teenager named Sara who lives with her unpleasant stepmom and a baby brother who is just a baby. When he keeps on crying and screaming all the time, Sara wishes that he'd 'dissapear' to a place far far away. So it happens but she suddenly realizes the grave mistake she made and with the dealings of the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) she sets out on an adventure through a complicated maze of walkways and  many obstacles, and solve the labyrinth to save her brother from becoming part of the Goblin Society forever if she doesn't rescue him within twelve hours.<br /><br /> \\"Labyrinth\\" is a classic for so many reasons. The storyline while not necessarily trekking new ground (at least at the time) is really fun and charmingly imaginative without being cheesy or two goody-two-shoes. The special effects are utterly amazing. Overall though, \\"The Labyrinth\\" has a look, atmosphere, and a style almost all of its own and is sorely lacking from a lot of movies of more recent times. Quite clearly one could notice that the Harry Potter movies were inspired by a lot of scenes from this movie.<br /><br /> All of the props and characters are awesome. One of my favorites is Hoggle, an `ugly' but good-hearted dwarf who aims to help Sara find her way through the labyrinth. She meets more friends who try to help her in her quest such as Ambrosia The Fox, and the hairy giant Ludo along with many others.<br /><br /> The DVD is really good although not the best compared with some others. It contains trailers for the film as well as interviews with the stars involved with the films making. There are also footage of Connelly along with Bowie and others in this movie. The movie comes in widescreen format which I like. This is a highly recommended movie and you should not hesitate to buy this. I guarantee it.o buy this. I guarantee it.  <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I hate to be a snotty old man but many of the reviewers representing the younger generation seem to have a problem formulating an intelligent sentence.  YO YO YO WASSSSUUUPPPP!  I can see why they're so dazzled by Lucas' tricks and chicanery when their heroes are people like Pauley Shore and Eminem, UGH!  I was born well after the cancellation of the original Star Trek series, and thus never saw it during its prime but was still able to grasp the importance of the drama, theatrics and nuance of the show.  Anyone will tell you that the visuals are not what made the show great, even though they were revolutionary for the time, it was the story that gripped people from week to week and caused the cultural phenomenon that we now have today.  It didn't matter that they used Styrofoam cups or that every alien looked oddly human or that Scotty could single-handedly reverse the laws of physics with the snap of his fingers, it was all about quality acting and storytelling (well quality storytelling anyway).    I'm sure you all get my drift but for the brain-dead, generation zero, robots out there, I'll have to elaborate.  Star Wars = Good.  Phantom Menace = Bad.  Original, untouched trilogy = Good.  Perverted, warped Special Edition = Bad.  Hitler = Bad.  George W. Bush = Worse.  Thus ends the lessen.    I just saw a commercial for Skittles, look at all the pretty colors, and have been subliminally commanded to run out and buy, buy, buy (blank stare).  (In a monotone robotic voice), I will obey.  I have no freewill.  Insert information into the USB port in the back of my head.    Question everything!  And resist.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I am looking forward to these new releases who hasn't.. i have seen the originals so many times i can't count and wishes 'Ol' George would also release the ORIGINALS but no doubt he will in a few years to come ive heard nasty rumours that he has changed the Special Editions that came out a few years ago on video by adding Hayden into the end of JEDI? and other changes(how many times is george gonna change em??) anyways im one of them who appreciates the ORIGINALS before they were changed into the SPECIAL EDITIONS we who are old enough to remember them would like to visit our childhood with seeing them and remembering how good the special effects were for that age before as some would say he ADULTERATED them and i will enjoy these films when they are released on 21st september but WILL HOPE GEORGE SEES SENSE and releases the ORIGINALS too as there are people out there who WANT THEM!! and he will make LOTS of money on them too. im from the United Kingdom and we are only getting the WIDESCREEN version :o(( so i have ordered them from here in the FULL SCREEN..
B0002O06N0|5.0|This is the way Jack White wants the White Stripes to sound but he can't quite make it there.  Guitar-wise, I suppose Dan Auerbach and  <br />JW are roughly equal, but Dan is 10 times the singer, which makes all the difference.   <br />These guys have soul, spirit, and a sound that knocks me out -- pure overdriven guitar and a barely competent drummer.  That last is not a criticism, mind you:  this would sound silly with a slick studio drum sound.  I have no doubt that Patrick plays this way for a reason, and it works. <br />Their maiden effort, \\"The Big Come Up\\" may be a better overall album, but this one is good enough, and is easily available.
B00028U6B8|5.0|As a drummer,singer,songwriter, who was a teen in the late sixties, I can remember the day I bought this album,(and After Bathing At Baxters!). If you like The Airplane, there are several cuts on this album that are their absolute best. The way ' Hey Frederick ' shifts gears,literally;Grace Slicks vocals, the tightness of the band make this song a classic. It grabs me everytime I listen to it. And we actually play,(though we don't do it proper justice), the Airplanes' version of Wooden Ships,which is on my top 10 list of all time favourite songs. Songs like Wild Tyme,Saturday Afternoon and Young Girl Sunday Blues etc. demonstrated that NOBODY did acid rock like Jorma Kaukonen! And Jack Cassidy is still one of my favourite bass players! The live cuts ,from the Filmore East,ARE a real bonus! - Ron ' Rock ' Larocque,Orleans,Ontario,Canada.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|\\"Return to Tunguska\\" is worth the price of admission all by itself if you're a fan of AP instrumentals.  While the overall compilation admittedly isn't quite as good as the cohesive \\"Time Machine\\", it's quite a bit better than the tedious \\"On Air\\" or the scattered \\"Try Anything Once.\\"  I personally like having a couple of redone classics, although I'd have preferred to have them as \\"bonus\\" tracks rather than taking 2 of a precious 9.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Okay, so I wasn't too... shall we say... \\"keen\\" on Binaural the first time I listened to it... I listened to the first five tracks and then put Vitalogy back in... But about two weeks ago I was getting a bit curious- If I listened to it again, would it grow on me? It certainly did! I've come to realize that it's one of the most expiremental (besides No Code and Yield), beautiful records that PJ has ever done! It's amazing.. there's not a track that I don't like. Okay, on to the tracks... <br /> <br />Breakerfall- This one's the usual \\"first track rocker\\"... Like Once, Go, Brain of J, etc.. This is one of the harder rockers on the album, even though it's not as intense as, say, Lukin or Blood... The entire album has got a calmer feel than any of PJ's other records... This track sets the album off with a good feeling and gets you headbanging. 8/10 <br />God's Dice- This is my second favorite track on the album.. It's got this awesome, hard rock/blues feel to it, especially the chorus. The best qualities of this song are Ed's awesome vocals, and Matt's b!tchin drums... Awesome track. 9/10 <br />EVACUATION!- I think Ed was high on vinyl (i say this because we all know Ed's straight edge now) when he wrote the chorus to this song... The verses lead up to it well, but you totally don't expect them all to start yelling \\"EVACUATION!\\" in startling, layered harmonies. VERY funky. 8/10 <br />Light Years- This was most definetely one of the hilights of the album for me; Ed's vocals are absolutely beautiful, almost like the amazing wails you hear on \\"Black\\" and tracks of the like... It's a slow one and sets the mood for the rest of the album. 8/10 <br />Nothing as It Seems- JEFFY'S SONG!!! This was the first single off of the album, although it's much too long for popular radio airplay (about 5 1/2 mins)... The lyrics are beautiful (Scratching voice...all alone... It's nothing like your baritone) The chorus has a beautiful beat, and once again Ed's vocals prove magnificent. 9/10<br />Thin Air- BEST...PJ SONG... EVER.... I can listen to it day in and day out and not get even remotely tired of it. It's a beautiful, light acoustic song, words and music both written by Stone... It's just so pretty it makes me want to cry.. It reminds you of a guy standing outside of his girlfriend's window strumming guitar... 20/10 <br />Insignificance- This is in my top three for the best songs of the album... The chorus is the hilight of the track with awesome harmonies, and the lyrics are magnificent. The verses are very light and melodic, but then when it shifts to \\"the full moon is dead skin\\", it gives you CHILLS. GREAT guitar work (Go Mike!) 10/10 <br />Of the Girl- This has a very funky feel to it. Ed's vocals are soft and serious.... Very strange, jazzy guitar work (which I have a feeling is Stone, correct me if I'm wrong :))... The chorus is great, and I love Stone's lyrics. 8/10 <br />Grievance- Another rocker at last! Ed's growl takes you back to the days of \\"Why Go\\" and \\"Rearviewmirror\\"... The lyrics are superb and the chorus is most definetely one of the best hard rock choruses I've ever heard..... For the first few seconds the chorus is almost a cappella, and then it just explodes.. This is an amazingly good song. 9/10 <br />Rival- This is probably the funkiest song on the album; It seems that Stone writes most of the hard-hitting, groovier tracks for PJ's records, and this one's no different. There are amazingly ominous harmonies and the beat is just addicting. 9/10 <br />Sleight of Hand- This is another slow one. These are probably the best lyrics in any of the tracks on Binaural... They just confuse you to no end. The chorus is amazing, building up a little more from the softer verses. Ed's vocals, again, are amazing. 8/10 <br />Soon Forget- Such a quirky little song! It turns some people off that it's so negative in the lyrics, but it's kind of an oxymoron type of thing, I guess.. Negative lyrics, happy tune. I think it just shows Ed's genius as a songwriter. The ukelele is extremely cute. The end is the hilight of the song; it just makes you laugh. I love it. 9/10 <br />Parting Ways- this is the \\"Release\\" of Binaural. No pun intended. It actually reminds me of Release in that Ed's lyrics and vocals are haunting and the music is just slow and calming. It's probably one of the best closers of any PJ album, besides Indifference off of Vs... It builds up more towards the end and I love when Ed starts singing \\"Driftin away\\". The strings are absolutely mesmerizing. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />So yes, overall, this album gets a five from me, not only because it's my favorite, not only because I'll probably give every PJ cd a five, but because it's just expiremental and downright funky. There are beautiful slow songs and some fast rockers, and the overall feel of the album is just chill. Awesome symbolic \\"writer's block\\" at the end. Ed's such a genius. It scares me sometimes... That about wraps it up.. Thanks for taking my review into consideration. As I've said in my other reviews, if you're just getting into PJ or you prefer \\"safer\\" rock than \\"alternative\\", get Ten or Vs. Die-hard Pearl Jam fans, get this or No Code.. Actually, while you're at it, get all of the albums! :) <br />Thanks! <br /> <br />
B00009RAJJ|5.0|For all those people who thought that Rumours was either the pinnalce of Fleetwood Mac's achievment,or took it as a sign that the group was a band not to be trusted in the approaching musical revolution of the late 70's, think again. Tusk stands as a shining, glorious moment in the Mac's career, an ambitious album that is two parts Talking Heads, one part Brian Wilson. After the monumental success of Rumours, many dismissed the Mac as yet another coke-snorting creation of the Californian ethos, and another band that would have to be destroyed when punk finally took over the world. Fortunately for all those involved, Lindsey Buckingham's fascination with the changing musical scene forced him to create an album so perfect that one must wonder why it often stands in the commerical shadow of it's predecessor. Buckignham treats us to new wave roller coasters on \\"The Ledge\\" and \\"Not That Funny\\", while simultaneously indulging in the classic Mac sound with \\"Save Me A Place\\" and the dreamy \\"That's All For everyone\\". And for all those Stevie lovers out there (and there are MANY...sigh...), Buckingham skillfully couples his new vision with her crystal visions to create such masterpieces as the mystical \\"Sisters of the Moon\\", \\"Angel\\" and \\"Beautiful Child\\". Last but not least, Christine Mcvie contributes reliable pop gems in \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Never Forget\\", while pushing the envelope in the sensual \\"Brown Eyes\\". Tusk failed to replicate the massive success of Rumours when it was first released in '79, and as such was considered something of a dud. Only now is it receiving the critical acclaim that it deserves from music aficionados and hipsters alike. The bonus disc that comes with this disc is chock full of great outtakes of some of the tracks-most notably Never Make Me Cry, Over and Over, and Brown Eyes- but where are the demos that were never released? Surely, this was a wonderful oppurtunity to include Lady From the Mountain, Watchdevil, Fireflies and the many other songs that were never officially recorded. In addition, while I Know I'm Not Wrong is a wonderful song, are three versions of it really neccessary? Finally, while Farmer's Daughter and Kiss and Run are great additions, the former is nearly identical to the version released on Fleetwood Mac Live, while the latter is nothing more than a rough outtake of a song...oh well. I guess you can't have it all. Still, that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a great album...and this is coming from someone \\"indie\\". And while you're at it, buy Rumours too...after all, it's not a bad album...just not as good as this one.
B000002HRE|5.0|Metallica's album Load is a great album im my opinon.  I has some harder tunes like the first track, \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" and number five \\"King Nothing\\".  However there are songs such as \\"Until it SLeeps\\" and \\"HEro of the Day\\" which mix the normal excitement that one recieves by listennig to a rock song, mixed with a more mellow, deeper feeling that is reminiscetn of their song \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" which is featured on Metalicca's self titled album.  I also want to bring to light a song not normaly played on the radio, that has became one of my must play osngs of this CD; \\"Bleeding Me\\".  It is a song with a sound of its own and it definitely adds to this CD's value.  There is also a acoustic song on this CD, \\"Thorn Within\\" which is kind of a venture fro Metallica but is still an enjoyable song to listen too.  Metallica shows why they are one of thebest in the business by again producing an album with a variety of songs that compliment each other and add to the overall feel of the album.
0316666343|1.0|I have to agree with most of the other critics: this book starts well, in true page-turner style, then it sadly loses focus and ends up fading out tediously, not quite knowing what it wants to say. Obviously written with a movie in mind, complete with soppy-sad Hollywood happy-end. Very disappointing.
1591840562|5.0|Guy Kawasaki has a nose for getting into action, and a gift for distilling what is going on once he's there.<br /><br />Guy has been a lot of things, Apple software evangelist, company president, Apple Fellow, Billy Graham school of evangelism graduate, and lately venture capitalist at Garage Technology Ventures.  Through out all these occupational \\"phases\\" Guy has written, distilling the essence of the geniuses around him, the genius of what works, and the genius of what is fun and new.<br /><br />THE ART OF THE START continues Guy's distilled essence tradition.  This time, the distilled essence is of how to get a business from idea to a funded going concern.  The book *feels* like advice written for entrepreneurs Guy has heard, but not funded.  My favorite chapter is #3: The Art of Pitching with its 10/20/30 rule (10 slides, 20 minutes, 30 point fonts).<br /><br />Academic, ... not! Guy's voice as a writer seems to have escaped the overbearing pomposity of his position as venture capitalist.  Unlike the manuals written by high-paid MBA financial flunkies, you won't find Guy droning on about every possible issue, you won't feel him hiding behind titles.  His love is distilling.  In this book the pomposity, the power, the aristocracy of the VC industry are distilled out.  What is left is what Guy thinks really matters.<br /><br />If you want to play in Silicon Valley, this could help.
B00008WG3U|1.0|I was riding with my friend in his car when I first heard this cd, and I must say that my ears are still burning from that unbearable punk sound. I asked him who it was, just so I could cringe when I see it in the store. He told me it was NOFX's war on errorism. I laughed, and said no really what is it. Well he wasn't kidding, and apparently it is now \\"cool\\" to be anti-bush because everybody is. He also told me that there is a anti-bush cd out called rock against bush. Hmmmmmmm, a bit far, eh? I seriously do not think that these cds make any difference on who somebody will be voting for since only anti-bush people buy this stuff. To tell you the truth it pushes me a little more to the right every time I hear or see something like this. Not to mention your listening to punk,(cue puking noises) only behind rap and country for worst music ever (metal reigns over all!). So truthfully Bush may not get in office again, but then again he could, and in twenty years when people will say \\"W was the best thing since Regan\\" and your little protest cds are still floating around wont it be fun to be laughed at more than punks are laughed at today (which by the way is alot, seeing how they can't seem to get a job or a haircut)? So finnaly I ask you what would you have done after the terrorist attacks? because nobody would have done nothing (and don't answer \\"I wouldn't have let it happen.\\" because you know that Clinton did just as little at stopping terrorism as Bush did. Remember the oklahoma city bombing?). P.S. try to remember that these things can and will bring down the moral of our troops and those who lost people on that day.
B000001ESF|3.0|I wonder why all the kids who were failing school liked this band, and all the kids who were doing well liked classical music and jazz? I gave RUSH far too much credibility back then. Oh well, lessons learned.  Pretty adept musicians, but they cater to drug heads.  I picked up this CD just for fun for 25 cents at a garage sale. I guess the drug dealer kid who owned it was tired of it.  <br /> <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie should have won the Oscar that year. I will just agree that the reviews here are just great. It really does have a moral message underneath all the Hollywood glitz and glam. I don't really know anything about Buddhism and I want to learn more now.
B00000IP3S|5.0|This was the album that forever hooked me to Blind Guardian. I've known them before, but tended to overlook these Germans. \\"IFTOS\\" easily pointed out that what I was overlooking is actually world's best power-metal band since Helloween's classic line-up parted ways (that's year 1990, if some of you don't know). <br /> <br />Like a fine wine, Blind Guardian steadily matured since their 1988 debut, and here we see the band in full strength. Singer/bassist Hansi Kursch gained full control over his own voice, and his performance really shines. He uses at least 3 different types of singing, calm clean singing, epic singing, and strained violent singing, while never losing melody, or the emphasis on key phrases. He changes vocal manner many times in any given song, which is amazing. Another band-member to develop is the drummer Thomas Stauch. From a rather mediocre performance of the debut, he has grown into one of the best drummers in his genre, who goes way beyond the cliche hyperspeed double-bass kicks, and provides much variety in patterns and fills. The guitarists' Andre Olbrich and Marcus Siepen performance is equally strong to their bandmates, and while the riffing is kind of specific, the solos and rhythm-guitar parts show signs of strong composing effort put in by the band. 5 more men to provide backing vocals for choruses (is there German metal without a choir and a huge sing-along potential in choruses?:) ) round up the picture. <br /> <br />So what do we end up with? I will have no doubts to put this album into metal's Top-20 of the 90s. Blind Guardian's interpretation of power-metal is full of diversity. It has a big influence of thrash-metal, particularly in how easily the band shifts tempos and signatures, and how the drummer works. It's full of sticky melodies, some of them reference German and some Eastern Europe's folk music. It went far away from 'verse-chorus' structure, and listening to the album the 1st time is an unpredictable experience. The lyricshave a strong fantasy theme, but it's not that teenage goofiness of many power-metal bands, and I'd rather call them bard's tales. In fact, an image of a group of medieval bards or minstrels (only with electric guitars) often comes to my mind when listening to Blind Guardian. Lyrics reference a number of well and not-so-well known sources, like Tolkien's famous Middle-Earth saga, or tales about King Arthur. <br /> <br />I've already mentioned variety of songs, but the most impressive thing is how any single song develops, shifts tempos, moods, vocal manners, twists and turns, and returns to previously used themes. Excellent! <br /> <br />I still think that classic Helloween (Jericho-Keepers period) is a template and a measure for everything there is to power-metal. Blind Guardian is one of the few bands to put out an equally strong album. Its mood is very different from Helloween's. Whereas Helloween had that feeling of easiness, humor and a tongue planted in cheek, Blind Guardian plays music that is more dark, dense and serious. But both bands do it with equally great instrumental and songwriting talents. <br /> <br />The obvious conclusion is as follows. If you love either classic metal, power-metal, German metal, or just any top-notch metal, this is an album for you. You can't go wrong starting your Blind Guardian collection with this CD. Absolute must-have!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Sometimes a romantic comedy comes along that pulls at so many strings and is appealing on so many levels that you have to watch it at least once or twice a year...this movie happens to be one of those special treats. <br /> <br />Paris becomes her own character in this beautiful comedy filled with the romance of a great city all under the watch of the sparkling Eiffel. This movie is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and he works the film around beautiful scenic French views leaving viewer's that love Paris breathless and begging for more. The storyline is humorous and the actors perfectly cast in roles that they seem natural at playing. The film is effortless to watch and that must be why it draws me in year after year. <br /> <br />Meg Ryan plays a woman engaged to Timothy Hutton in a boring and predictable little relationship. Things change drastically when Hutton goes to Paris on business and leaves Ryan at home because she is afraid to fly. But there is nothing like an old jealous heart to overcome such a silly phobia and Ryan finds herself on a plane to Paris to save her man from the arms of a beautiful young Parisian. Aboard the plane she meets Kevin Kline, who represents all things stereotypically French! Ryan is always perfect as the girl next door who stumbles about trying to stay in love. She is cute and perky as usual. Hutton is staid and serious until he is seduced by a vibrant and passionate French woman and begins his mid-life crisis falling for the belief that this seductress wants him and not his salary. Kline is convincingly French, with his wild haired and open minded talk, his always present dismissing pout and his passion for life. The fun begins as the plane lands in Paris and it never ends. <br /> <br />If you love France this film will romance you many times over. The cast is great together and the romantic comedy great for the heart. From the most romantic city in the world Kasdan gives us a new reason to dance and a desire to kiss as the French do!  <br />
B000002HPT|3.0|Many people see this as Dream Theater's attempt at the mainstream. I see it as their producers telling them to make a mainstreeam album, and then rushing them before they can truly finish everything that they need to. John Petrucci doesn't show up that much which paves the way for Derek Sherinian to show off how truly talented he is. <br />New Millenium 10/10- Good song in which Sherinian takes the spotlight; and he sounds great! Petrucci has some nice riffs but every time it seems like he's about to take off, he doesn't for some reason. I thought it was going to have a great ending, because with one minute left, Petrucci starts off with a pounding guitar but doesn't go anywhere, but overall still a really good song. <br />All About You 9/10- Riff sounds almost exactly like STP's \\"Vasoline\\" but I don't think that it is a ripoff. Good guitar solo where Petrucci has a fret burning, blindly fast section, which is amazing. <br />Peruvian Skies 9/10- Starts off really slow and takes forever to pick up but once that it does, Petrucci has a great solo and makes this song worthwhile. <br />Hollow Years 6/10- Mainly for acoustic fans, of which I am not one. Probably the most mainstream sounding song on the disc. <br />Burning My Soul 5/10- Can somebody say Metallica? Blatant rip-off takes off any admirable qualities to the song. <br />Hell's Kitchen 10/10- Great instrumental is a nice break from some of Dream Theater's more complex songs. It is simple, but it's nearly impossible not to like it. <br />Lines in th Sand 8/10- One of their longer songs, at over 11:00 long, could have had one or two or three minutes shaved off. If they had spent some more time filling up the dull parts with more exciting ones, this could have been one of DT's best long songs. <br />Take Away my Pain 6/10- So sappy that it severly hurts the song, it's obvious that this was to satify the people that wanted a more \\"commercial\\" album. <br />Just Let Me Breathe 5/10- Tries to show that Dream Theater really is mainstream with the mentioning of Kurt Cobain and Shannon Hoon, and also trying to make a point at the same time fails miserably. That's really all there is, nothing special performancewise; a complete waste of time. <br />Anna Lee 6/10- Not as bad as I thought it was going to be when I heard the first part, is still trying to be too sentimental. <br />Trial of Tears 5/10- Possibly their worst epic ever, is 13:00 long and should only be 3:00, and it would still be dull. Poor ending. <br />As poor and rushed this album was, it's still not that bad. You can tell that Dream Theater was against making this so commercial or they would have taken out all of the guitar solos and basically anything that shows talent (see Queensryche's \\"Tribe\\"). With all the poor songs, there's still some good stuff buried here so still get it, just don't make it your first Dream Theater album, instead start out with \\"Images and Words.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never heard of Firefly until I saw it on an Amazon recommendation.  Then awhile later, I read some reviews of Farscape (another show that I'd never seen or heard of).  Then I got tem confused and ordered Firefly.  I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />I've watched 12 of the 14 episodes, and I can confidently say that if this show were currently in production, I'd make a point to watch it.  The writing, casting, and acting are all top-notch.  Despite what you might think, the Western theme works well.  It's certainly one of the more original things to appear on  TV, and if you liked Babylon 5 and/or Deep Space 9, you should like this.  And if you didn't like them, you still ought to give it a look.
B000002V1D|5.0|As the synth-pop sound began to fade in the 1980s, many artists either reinvented themselves or found the themselves falling into obscurity.   Bands such as Tears For Fears were very successful at changing their style.   Tears For Fears had incredible success with a synthesizer based sound, but as they entered the 1990s, they successfully produced a more \\"natural\\" sound.  Duran Duran originally didn't make such a change.   Duran Duran were the darlings of MTV and radio in the early and mid 1980s.   However, the band began to undergo some lineup changes and they didn't readily make such a change to produce something new and exciting.   Duran Duran started the decade like gang-busters but late 80s albums such as \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Big Thing\\" were mediocre.  From a synth-pop angle they weren't nearly as strong as the early 80s work.    By 1990 their next album \\"Liberty\\" was a flop.  This put Duran Duran in an unlikely position in 1993 - having to make a comeback.  And boy do they ever make a comeback with \\"Duran Duran (The Wedding Album)\\".   This album might be one of the most underrated albums of all time and should have even gotten Album of the Year consideration. <br /> <br />What made \\"The Wedding Album\\" such a great album?  I think you have to go back to the late 80s when Duran Duran was undergoing lineup changes.  When drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor departed, musicians were needed to supplement them for the \\"Notorious\\" album.  Enter Missing Persons alumni Warren Cuccurillo.  Cuccurillo would take guitaring duties for Taylor.   He would tour with the band, but played a studio musician role in the band for \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Big Thing\\".  Cuccurillo had played with Frank Zappa and Missing Persons and had a different style - a more experimental and edgy style than the rest of Duran Duran.  He became an full fledged member of the band for the \\"Liberty\\" album.  Duran Duran was still very much out of focus due to business problems with the label, so \\"Liberty\\" bombed.  The band then took three years to re-focus and put together what could be considered a radical departure from the synth pop days - \\"The Wedding Album\\". <br /> <br />It's clear that Cuccurillo's had a big influence on the band with this album.  He helped to introduce many different elements that haven't been seen before. This includes a more natural guitar sound, rap and funk elements, and stronger lyrics - all not seen on a Duran Duran album ever.   This is also the first where we hear of the very unlikely Duran Duran - Lou Reed connection (again thanks to Cuccurillo via his Frank Zappa Days). There is a terrific cover of Velvet Underground (Lou Reed's band) \\"Femme Fatale\\" and Duran Duran would later cover Reed's \\"Perfect Day\\" on their \\"Thank You\\" collection. <br /> <br />The first two songs \\"Too Much Information\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\" bring a more natural guitar sound.    You wouldn't think this was the synth-pop band from the 1980s. \\"Too Much Information\\" starts out with the appropriate words \\"Destroyed by MTV...\\" (which seems appropriate by 1993 when they were making a comeback).  There are some terrific lyrics that deal with advertising blitz in our society.  \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\" show that Simon Le Bon can still belt out a great tune.  \\"Come Undone\\"  features background vocals by one of the best studio vocalists in the business - Tessa Niles. <br /> <br />The fourth track \\"Drowning Man\\" has a bit of a fused jazz-rock introduction.  The song then progresses into a rap - and it works terrific.  The song then has a heavy dance beat.  Duran Duran had started out as an underground dance band and now it seems they have come full circle, but now do it with an updated sound.   The fifth track has a major funk influnce - \\"Shotgun\\".  It is less than a minute long, but it sounds almost like a Prince tune.  Again, the band pulls this off perfectly.  The eighth track is \\"UMF\\" is a combination of funk and rock.  Again Duran Duran seems to come full circle with their roots - but 90s style.   <br /> <br />There are signs of the old Duran Duran.  \\"Love VooDoo\\" kind of reminds me of the \\"Notorious\\" days - not a bad song, but not great.  \\"The song \\"None of the Above\\" might be a dark song of despair,  but a catchy one. The interesting part is how it opens with some of the classic vocals you've heard from Simon Le Bon - \\"I am myself Alone..\\" <br /> <br />Duran Duran does something really different in the song \\"Breath Under Breath\\".  This song opens with some keyboards and Le Bon's ballady lyrics.  The song then has a segue into a Spanish-like guitar sound that is eventually followed by some vocals in Spanish.   This is terrific stuff - and again a far cry from the \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" days. <br /> <br />The last two songs on the collection have a loose segue between them.  \\"To Whom It May Concern\\" has a sound that easily fits in with the alternative rock trends that were starting during this time.  However it is the catchy last song \\"Sin of the City\\" which is by far the best track in the album.  It wraps the album up beautifully as it incorporates the rock, funk, darker lyrics, and even some of the old Duran Duran sounds into one package.  This song could have easily burned up the dance floor in the clubs. <br /> <br />Finally the liner notes are very original.  They are arranged to look like a scrapbook and each page is a work of art.  It does production credits and some of the lyrics difficult to read, but it is by far one of the most original liner notes I have ever seen.  This is one terrific collection.  I think the deep Duran Duran fan will appreciate it and I also think Duran Duran gained a new fan base with this new direction.  Highly recommended.
B00028HBL6|1.0|If you are really serious about faith, grace, committment, what one is suppose to do in this world, how we are to respond and take care of others, Gibson's mindless Hollywood Smash here is useless and a gross waste of time. It reminded me of a Playstation or XBOX game come to life in the screen.<br /><br />Jesus was a subversive a revolutionary, He wanted you to know his Father and what the Word of God means, and how one conducts himself in the beauty of one's faith. For a deeper understanding of what I am talking about please see Pasolini's \\"The Gospel According to St.Matthew\\". There all the Hollywood buzz,hype,blitz, zizztz is removed. This is a film from the early Sixties and Pasolini was quite brave to make it, portraying Jesus as a revolutionary, and giving one something to think about. With Gibson as most Hollywood  films you check your brain at the Box Office before entering.<br /><br />What does Gibson tell you here about Jesus, any new insight into belief and faith in our post 9/11 era?? Nothing at all, just gratuitous violence that is \\"Fun\\" for many unfortunately.

B0001XAPX8|4.0|The Human Stain takes a penetrating look at the myths with which society surrounds itself in order to remain `respectable', and how those myths are simply a portal into another level of suffering. It portrays the stains which persist in society, and which, even after constant cleansing, get perpetuated into the future and our lives in one form or the other.<br /><br />I thought that the theme was very interesting, the movie itself, less so. Anthony Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a highly respected Professor of Classics at Athena College, Massachusetts. Right from his arrival, he has catapulted the College to fame and respectability, and has become Dean. His own respectability is undermined when he once innocently calls two black students, perpetually absent from class, as `spooks'. He is unaware of the derogatory meaning of the phrase, and the two students press charges against him. He resigns in anger, and the faculty members apparently are only too satisfied to let him go, because they want to avoid scandal. The year is 1998, and the country itself is enveloped in the throes of a scandal-the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.<br /><br />Silk's wife dies from the shock of the accusations, and Silk becomes a lonely, dark, grudging man. Some solace comes in the form of a friendship with a young writer (Gary Sinise), himself living in seclusion in the woods after a hard fight with cancer. But the wheels of Silk's destiny really start turning when he begins an intense affair with an illiterate janitor (Nicole Kidman), many years younger than him. In turn, she faces chronic problems of her own, including an abusive childhood and a drunken, raucous and abusive Vietnam veteran husband. The rest of the movie essentially revolves about Silk's tumultuous and scandalous present life, and a disturbing past, which harbours a dark secret. I won't give it away for those of you who haven't watched it, but let it suffice here to say that he is running away from a stain which was inflicted on him many years back, as a young man in love, and an expert boxer. Silk's life long attempts to hide that old stain ironically have landed him into another disturbed existence.<br /><br />I thought that the movie itself failed to be very interesting, although the director seems to have made sincere attempts to keep the intrigue and philosophy flowing. The one thing that shines through are the performances by Hopkins, Sinise and Kidman. The Human Stain makes an interesting foray into the inevitabilities of life. If we hide from a truth, it's very likely that another will haunt us, just like it haunted Silk. Better than that to face the truth and fight for it. But the problem is still not resolved. Society still has to inure itself to many blatant and supposedly embarrassing eventualities in it's citizens' lives. We still have to come to terms with the ugly ducklings among us, moralizing and generous as our expressed views and opinions about them may be. Society itself has a long way to go before it becomes all-accommodating. The most penetrating stains, it seems, are the ones which cannot be seen.ars back, as a young man in love, and an expert boxer.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|I have listened to this album regularly since it came out (3 years now?) and I never tire of it. In fact, it continues to grow on me every time I put it on. Each song conveys emotion that few other artists can match - \\"Touch, Feel, Lose\\" is a perfect example of this. When I listen to that song, I can not only feel Ryan's pain, but I can also relate it to my own experiences. All in all, one of my favorite albums of all time!
B00005JMAH|3.0|Like the many fans of the Harry Potter books and movies,I waited with bated breath for this movie to open only to be disappointed. If I hear \\"it's not the book\\" one more time I'll scream. There's no doubt it's not the book,it's not even close. And the \\"fans of the book\\" are the people shortchanged. That's why I went to see the MOVIE, to see the BOOK brought to life. <br />Hogwarts went from this beautiful magic place to a run down shabby castle somewhere in the Swiss Alps. <br />People talked about the \\"fresh new approach\\" this film had, I don't want \\"fresh\\" I want the world of Harry Potter I've come to love. The books get progressively darker in nature as they go along, almost to the point of being almost as dismal our world, they need the Chris Columbus feel about them to survive. <br />There's not one fan of the books I know that would not gladly watch 2 movies or a 4 hour movie rather than another pale image of what we all thought this movie would be. <br />I hope the producers listen to the fans, if not they will listen to the box office next time around.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Let's face it, folks. Whenever you hear the word \\"Zombie\\", right away you think of George Romero and this film. Anchor Bay is not kidding when they call this the ultimate edition. It has the original US theatrical version (which was also released in March by Anchor Bay), the extended \\"Director's Cut\\" and my personal favorite, the European version. I saw this version in Germany when it first came out. George is a great director, but Dario Argento edited the version for non-english speaking countries and came up with a tighter, sometimes more aggresive version. And how can you not like the extra music by Goblin. The extras alone on this ultimate edition are worth the cost, from the 92 minute new documentary to Roy Frumkes \\"Document of the Dead\\" and all the theatrical trailers from around the world to the different audio commentary on each edition. All I can say is, snap this one up. It doesn't get any better. And a big \\"thanks\\" to Anchor Bay Entertainment for putting this out.

0671027344|1.0|This book is pure human feces bound between two pieces of cardboard. It epitomizes all that is emo and wrong with the world today.

It's very easy for impressionable kids, particularly fans of the band Saves The Day, to be drawn in by all this melodramatic baloney and believe that this book is teaching them some valuable epiphany. All this book does is breed legions of lame Chris Carrabba clones who believe that a breakup is just as bad as finding a large tumor on your left testicle.

The world of Westeros and beyond are believable places; the characters are so well portrayed that you will fall in love with some and loathe others; you will feel their pain and joy.

The author claimed himself to be a spiritual teacher but I'm doubt it if he has the necessary qualities. I feel sorry for his self-righteous attitude and especially for his deluded view. <br /> <br />Finally, if you would like to have some good hints on mindfulness and the joy of mindful living, I highly recommend you to Thich Nhat Hanh (a Zen master and a peace activist) books such as \\"Peace is every step\\", \\"The miracle of mindfulness\\", etc.
B00005JMAH|4.0|All the negative reviews of this movie are so clearly from fans of the book unable to seperate the film from the movie.  <br /> <br />If you are huge fan of the books and cannot come into this film and view it as its own creation, you will be disappointed. The Harry Potter books are way to large and sprawling to make a good movie if directly translated. Film and books are different mediums with different strengths. All the little details that endear the books to their fans would be nothing but distractions if put into the film. And certain things that work in the storyline were left out entirely, saved for later movies (as with the fans biggest complaint, the ommission of Harry learning the origins of the mauraders map will simply be saved for a time when it will work better in the movie), or moved around. <br /> <br />But who cares? This is an amazing movie on its own. It only makes me with that Alfonso Cuaran had 1. done the first two films and 2. agreed to continue on in the next film. He is the first director of this series to insist that things could not be \\"too\\" faithful, and be willing to change it around for the integrity of the movie. JK Rowlings herself has said that she liked this film, so fans should stop complaining as if he is \\"ruining the series.\\" The direction is beautiful. The change of setting perfect. Few things were added, but those that were (like the clocktower) work perfectly with the themes running through this film.  <br /> <br />At times, the film seems a bit rushed, as even with the cuts taken it is still a large book to condense to this amount of time. Perhaps as the series goes on the directors will do what Peter Jackson has done, and offer extended editions, allowing fans to feel satisfied, as well as giving the directors the liberty to cut favorite scenes when they really are making the film too long and disjointed. <br /> <br />Either way, this is a masterpiece of filmmaking. Beyond the direction, the acting has improved drasticly. Cuaran is taking advantage of the kids age and forcing them to really push their craft. Hopefully, he will stay involved in the future versions of the series and the new directors will be inspired by this brilliant new direction.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'm a college student and suffice to say that Moulin Rouge is usually considered a chick flick and maybe even kind of gay. I tend to like classic drama, comedy and action films. I was not looking forward to it at all. <br /> <br />My girlfriend and I watched Moulin Rouge last night and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We are both quasi-practicing Taoists. Imagine my surprise when I go onto Amazon and read reviews about the religious and spiritual significance of the movie. We discussed it and my girlfriend and I are now convinced the religious element is there and are planning on watching it again tonight. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman is beautiful in this movie and I was surprised how good of a voice she has. Ewan McGregor is so cool that I was worried by my girlfriend's reaction to him. And the \\"Like a Virgin\\" scene is just so funny.  <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is a successful attempt at getting rich off of a controversial decision to go to war to liberate Iraq from a murderous dictator. Moore is a liar, a fraud, and an admitted enemy of the American people. He had capitalized on the natural fear that people experience whenever they are at war....& yes, people, we are at war.
0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris has written an interesting book calling for the end of religious belief systems. I was expecting something on the order of \\"GOD'S FUNERAL\\". This book was more a call to arms than a scholarly evaluation.  In any case, superstition, religion and faith are not going away anytime soon despite the numerous predictions to that effect. A scientific article recently opined that belief in the supernatural could be hard-wired into our evolutionary psychology.   <br /> <br />I detect three problems in the book (despite my agreement with the tenor of his message): (1) He offers nothing in place of religion.  Nice words and good deeds do not suffice. As Russell said, \\"God can only be replaced with another god.\\"  That may be humanism, Buddhism (one of the nuttiest), scientific determinism, duty to mankind or some other idea but none has the appeal or hold of religion.  <br /> <br />(2) He sees all religions as being morally equivalent and equally dangerous - from once-a-year Methodists to suicidal Islamists. The American religion for over 200 years has been an ecumencalism that benefitted all concerned. We are the most religious and most technologically advanced society on Earth, a paradox. But there is a tempering of a strong dose of realism. As the New Englander said, \\"Trust in Providence but leave nothing to chance.\\"  More believe in astrology than that the world is only 7,000 years old. And even fundamentalists who do think that are not running around chopping off heads of those who disagree.   <br /> <br />(3) He wants to lose ALL superstition. Does that include New Age crap, astrology, chain letters, the idea of luck, the lottery? How far do you go in forcing people to be rational? There are many, Harris included, who yearn for a Startrek World in which religion has disappeared and humanity marches solemly forward to the beat of peaceful coexistencee, scientific progress and the wonder of discovery. While those are all worthy ideas they do not capture the \\"soul\\".Good reading - bad pleading.
B0002IU988|4.0|More like 4.5 stars.  I am a huge music fan of pop, rock, r&b, club/dance, classic rock, easy listening, etc so my opinion is taken from an unbiased perspective.  This is a great CD.  Mark T. kicks a _ _ on guitars & he is so hot.  My favorite song on this cd is \\"In Loving Memory\\".  Not only because it is such an emotional and powerful song both emotionally & lyrically, but if you haven't noticed that whenever a rock band releases a rock ballad from a cd (like \\"The Reason\\" from Hoobastank & that one from Creed that was written by Scott S. when he learned he was going to be a father - can't think of the name) the song always tops the charts.  It's nice when rockers can showcase their compassionate side.  The song gives me chills.  This would be a huge hit.  The lead singer has a great voice.  This is a definite recommendation for music fans.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I first heard \\"duality\\" it sounded like Slipknot was trying to be like Mudvayne, so I did not want to buy this CD.  In fact I felt like doing exactly what they were singing.  When I finally did buy the CD, however, it blew me away.  It sounds like Memento on crack mixed with a little bit of Seether and Mudvayne.  But it still has that Slipknot sound that I have grown to love.  This CD is definetly their best CD yet.
B000268QB2|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  Keane reminds me of a mixed sampling in the sounds of Coldplay, U2, & a touch of Beatles.  I love the piano driven sound that is also combined with the character of a rock band.  These are truely talented guys that offer a new, refreshing, breathtaking, & unique sound that is similar to the reaction I got when I first heard Coldplay.  This is a spectacular CD.  I am a fan of so many types of music including, pop, rock, classic rock, r&b, contemporary country, easy listening, etc. & therefore my opinion is from an open mind & unbiased perspective.  Go get this cd....it's great.  <br />
0321213351|5.0|WOW! This is a powerhouse of amazing content! My entire professional practice has evolved due to this book, much like we did when the GoF was released.<br /><br />Now is the time for a book like this for leaders in software engineering. If you are a beginner to patterns, this 'might' be better then any other book, depending on how you learn.<br /><br />If you prefer 'bottom up' learning then this will be much easier. If you prefer to go from Theory to application, then start with the original GoF book.<br /><br />You should know refactoring as written by Fowler (a modern classic). If not buy it immediately! That is, unless you are writing COBOL on an old 360 and are going to retire in a year &#60;grin&#62;.<br /><br />I expect this book to win the Jolt 2005 award easily. Seriously, this book has greatly influenced my work as a global Agile consultant as I have proven that you cannot do Agile development as documented, without a 'refactoring to patterns' step in your iterations. Finally I can refer to them by a simple name! Or more correctly you can do Agile Software Development but you will likely not achieve the promised 'flat cost curve' without adding some steps.<br /><br />Not to self-promote, but my book due in Q1 2005 leverages Joshua's book heavily AND DOES provide an Agile Process that a team can get much closer to the flat curve (if not achieve) in my data. In my opinion, the inventors of XP when that was published realized it because they are all so amazingly good. We all do not have that luxury.<br /><br />My firm is a consultant to America's largest companies and as CEO I can tell you there are few team building the critical 10 million systems that have a mastery of Patterns and Refactoring to Patterns, something I prove definitively is REQUIRED for any non-trivial Agile project to meet the economic promise of Agile. You will do better then Waterfall, but frankly that is easy by just being CMM-0 &#60;grin&#62;.<br /><br />There is an article I am publishing that is coming our soon that has content you can use NOW. If interested email me and I will make sure you get a copy.<br /><br />Here is my recommended reading list for those who are new to all this (and which I am constantly asked for):<br /><br />Track A - For the Bottom Up Thinker (not a bad thing by the way):<br /><br />1) Read 'Refactoring' by Martin Fowler if you have not already. I am assuming you have, but just in case I am listing it.<br />2) Get the Workbook on Refactoring and use it<br />3) Read Design Patterns - The GoF Original - Read it slowly and probably at least twice. The CD version is also great.<br />Refactoring.<br />4) Buy this book (Refactoring to Patterns) and read it next. Practice extensively in doing these and REMEMBER: Never refactor in a serious way without a strong Unit Test Base to cover you. If you do not know what I mean, please read Kent Beck's excellent book on 'Test Driven Development.<br />5) Buy a Patterns book for the language you use (I use C# so I use the latest C# Patterns book and hold a study group via conference call every week. We are on Yahoo Groups).<br /><br />Track B - For the Tom Down Thinker<br /><br />You can skip the workbook perhaps.. Look at it and decide for yourself.<br /><br />REMEMBER: Never refactor in a serious way without a strong Unit Test Base to cover you. If you do not know what I mean, please read Kent Beck's excellent book on 'Test Driven Development.<br /><br />I am assuming you have read 'Refactoring' by Martin Fowler. If not, please do yourself a favor and do this first.<br /><br />1) Read Design Patterns - The GoF Original - Read it slowly and probably at least twice.

We are on Yahoo Groups).<br />3) Buy this book and read it next and apply it until it is instinct.<br /><br />Email me with feedback!

1573921394|5.0|Most of the reviews above are political diatribes against Keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something COULD be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't. expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place. Although difficult to read, this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics. Far from being destructive, it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930's. I recommend you read this book.

B00003CXCT|3.0|When I was younger, I used to hear my father talk about the war.  WWII that is.  He spoke with such intensity about the horrors, with such sadness about the losses, and with such optimism about the victory.  Sorry to say, I didn't and couldn't grasp the depth of his feelings about those times.  To me the War was a black and white experience, molded by the images and sounds of the then contemporary newsreels and films; and so it remains to this very day.   Yet my father was only a youth from 1940 - 1945.  Having lived through that period, however, influenced his life in many ways.  As much as I would have liked to have shared a sense of that life event, there is simply no way for me to jump into my father's shoes and experience it the way he did.  The same is true for movie fans of every generation.  Some films affect us in tremendous ways.  Some films influence who we want to be, or who we eventually become.  Some films define a period of our lives and become so inextricably a part of our past that we build our memories around when we viewed them and the impact they had on us.  Such is the legacy of the Star Wars films.  Just as with the shooting of JFK, I can recall where I was and when it was that I saw Episode IV for the first time.  It gave me the same thrilling satisfaction as when I read the Count of Monte Cristo for the first time or any of the Hemingway novels. It was pure escapism, pure adventure, and it helped me get through four years of college.  But it was MY experience, and I can't expect anyone outside of my generation to understand or appreciate what it meant to me.  That's why comments that argue that \\"old fans\\" should \\"move on\\" and \\"embrace the future\\" are ridiculously meaningless.  These are from kids who simply can't step in my shoes.  <br /> <br />Distilled to its essence, films are nothing more than moving pictures that tell a story.  It's no different from a book other than in its presentation.  What this debate is all about is the power or abuse thereof of owning intellectual property.  Mr. Lucas is free to experiment with his asset because he owns it.   We can't complain.  It's our system.  This is business, and filmmakers are entitled to earn a living, and the investors/producers/distributors of these films are entitled to earn a profit.  Those of us that want the original version on DVD will simply have to wait until it gets released, or copy our VHS versions over to digital.   What Mr. Lucas has done for me, however, is increase my appreciation for all of the classic novels I've read over the years.  At least those can't be changed, which is why they call them classics.
B00003CXDG|2.0|..which is a statute we have in the U.K., no doubt you have something similar.  <br /> <br />The main thing to say about MI2 is that, like the first one, it isn't a Mission Impossible story. Mission Impossible, to me, is a caper story, premised on impossible, or at least highly unfeasible missions, carried out by a team. This film, like the first one (which starts by wiping out the team almost as soon as they've been established with the viewer) has a couple of fairly bland henchmen with gadgets and that's all. A film almost entirely about Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's chiselled features, death-defying acrobatics and intrepid duelling with the chief villain, whatever its own merits, is simply not true to the premise of (or what was so good about) the show we remember from way back when. So don't call it Mission Impossible. Call it the Man With The Golden Grin.
B0001AP12G|5.0|The Kanye West, College Dropout CD is amazing! I love this CD because it's one you can listen to straight through whether you are crusing around or just sitting in your room. There is a lot of influence from Jay-Z, like 50 Cent who immerged with Eminem's influence. Jay-Z helped bring Kanye into the public eye. This CD wasn't released without a mention of Jay-Z's elite status on the track \\"Never Let You Down\\". This CD has awesome beats, thanks to Jay-Z. <br />Also, Kanye's tracks have different messages from one to the next; he covers a lot of ground on this CD. He incorporates Jesus and religion into his music which is awesome because until now a lot of rappers have been very cautious to do so. He went out in a limb putting his religious views on this CD because it is his first big production. He also wrote about speaking up for today's youth on the track \\"We Don't Care\\", and his own personal struggles on the track \\"Through the Wire\\". I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for the next big thing in rap. <br />
B00000I01A|5.0|The flow of ROCKY 4 penetrates my soul and flows electrically throughout my body. This is the ultimate music for the athlete. When the songs play the hairs of my neck stand up, my muscles flex and I bite my lower lip in a fit of tension, nodding my head up and down to the beat. During track #10, at times I just want to drop into a seizure. This is the phattest, baddest sound for conditioning. When I hear the heart pounding music, as it crescendos, I can't decide whether to drop and do 100 pushups, run 10 miles or karate chop a phone book. You think I am being sarcastic, but I'm not! I'm a huge fan of Rocky. If you want to lose 50 pounds or when you have that urge to eat that double cheeseburger, pop in this CD and go for a run.  <br /> <br />Oh, and buy 2 of these CD's in case one gets scratched! I keep one in my car and one in my walkman. <br /> <br />
B0002O06N0|5.0|Just like many TBK fans, I've been waiting for their third release, \\"Rubber Factory.\\" This one, just like their others, does not disappoint.    As awesome as TBK's studio recordings are, they're no comparison to their live shows. The limited edition of RF came with a bonus DVD. I hope you can still get your hands on a copy of \\"Live in Austin, TX,\\" 'cause it's killer!    Enjoy the music, enjoy the videos. They're both worth it.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quinten Tarantino has done it again. He has brought back vision and direction to what has become a dead art form. In a world of blatantly ignorant teenage sex films and mindless violence, its very refreshing to see someone creating a truly beautiful film. His vision truly dances across the screen, and every inch of it oozes Tarantino. <br />     This movie is the conclusion of the two part Kill Bill storyline. wheras Kill Bill Vol. 1 was full of action and gore (lots of gore.) with rather little explanation of who the Bride is or why she is doing this, Vol. 2 has much more to do with the characters themselves. In Vol. 1 when you see a character onscreen, more than likely they will be dead in the next five minutes. This gives you no real time to understand the characters, or make real connections with them, which is a shame, as dynamic characters are one of the strongest qualities of Tarantino's films. where vol. 1 does little, Vol. 2 comes through in spades. In Vol. 2, you are finally introduced to the character Bill (David Charandine), who is one of the most interesting and complex characters in years. one of the early scenes in the movie chronicles the moments immediately before the Massacre at Two Pines, and is easily the most memorable scene in the film. It shows another side of Bill, apart from the cold blooded killer aspect. make no mistake, Bill is most definitely a murderer, but he is by no means heartless.  This character is played brilliantly by David Charandine, who deserves the highest of accolades for his performance.  another character that struck me was Bill's brother Budd, played by Michael Madsen (thats right, mr. Blonde himself). Budd is a lowlife, who fights dirty and is the least elegant of the characters. despite this, you cant help but love him. He really is a poet and a philosopher once you get past the grime. <br />     One of peoples complaints about this film is its climax. where the first movie had an amazingly choreographed showdownin a Japanese garden, this one has somewhat of an anticlimax. I dont think im ruining it for anyone by revealing that the Bride does indeed kill Bill, as if she didnt, it would be downright aggravating for the audience.  however, the fashion in which she kills him is not particularly vengeful or driven by hate. you can tell that she has conflicting emotions, that she both loves him for who he is and hates him for what he has done. some may be angry because its unconventional, but I dont think Tarantino could have done it in any other way. bravo. <br />     My complaints with this movie are few and far between. a few of the scenes seemed unrealistic, to say the least. now this wouldnt be a problem, if the rest of the movie wasnt so true to life. A few of the characters perform a few actions that are unbelieveable, and not in the good sense. its slightly distracting from the genius of the film, but nothing to fret about. <br />     This movie is nothing short of pure genius, plain and simple. <br /> <br />\\"that woman deserves her revenge... and we deserve to die.   but then again, so does she. so we'll just see then, wont we?\\" <br />Budd
0553573403|1.0|This book is garbage. I can't believe it has any positive reviews at all. It absolutely disgusted me. It is chock full of incest and pedophilia. I am absolutely disgusted. At one point, one of the characters screwed a thirteen-year-old girl - out in the open.<br /><br />That should be enough to turn your stomach right there.<br /><br />Even if it wasn't for that, the writing style is completely obnoxious. I had a hard time getting through this book. Every chapter is in a different character's perspective. Because of this, almost EVERY character is round and it is just way too much information to keep track of. This is not a book you can just sink back and enjoy.<br /><br />This is NOT a fun read in any way shape or form, and obviously not a stand-alone piece... most of the POVs are establishing situations for the next book(s) in line and heaping disaster, misfortune, and death on top of the central family - the author can't even be bothered to establish a central character.<br /><br />But I still can't get away from that little girl. And I can't think of this book without wanting to hurl.<br /><br />Please, please, avoid this. It truly is horrible.
B00006RCLQ|3.0|This is a classic horror movie from 1962 filmed in Kansas, and at an abandoned theme park on the Great Salt Lake in Utah, \\"Saltair.\\" There is now a colorized DVD available from Off-Color Films featuring a commentary track by Mike Nelson. I recommend the version with the commentary for vastly improved entertainment value.<br /><br />The film itself is actually modestly creepy. It stars Candace Hilligoss as a schizophrenic, antisocial church organist with a major spiritual dilemma being taunted by beings from beyond the grave, led by Zombie-In-Chief, and also Director, Herk Harvey (famous for making many Centron educational shorts like \\"Industrial Arts\\" and \\"Juvenile Delinquency.\\")<br /><br />The plot is straightforward, and I won't reveal it here, but it involves drag racing, otherworldly (if not possessed) organ playing, and the creepiest boarding house in film history. The Off-Color DVD has several extras including the original trailer. I thought the movie was a tad better than Mike Nelson did, but while perhaps groundbreaking in 1962, it is tame if not boring in today's world. It is generally a credible effort with some genuine spookiness despite its dated appearance.<br /><br />As an aside, the film makers decided on a soundtrack that was solo organ music, and the droning, buzzing noodling on the organ is extremely annoying in a very short while. It was evidently scored and performed by an organist who had not yet learned to play the organ.
B000006TRV|5.0|Ah, December 1979.  Inflation is high, recession is coming, the hopes of Iranian liberty are being slowly but quite surely throttled by a nasty theocracy, Suharto and Botha can look to another decade of blood-drenched power, The Soviets are invading Afghanistan, the Americans are thereby giving yet another bloodthirsty Pakistani junta an undeserved lease on life, the Italian Christian Democratic Party has wiggled out of a well deserved nemesis, Thatcher has taken power, Reagan is rising, Archbishop Romero has only a few months to live, American cinema is on the brink of financial disaster, followed by artistic collapse, and most pop music sucks.  (I mean really, \\"I Love the Nightlife\\"?)  So it's time to get back to the basics, and here is \\"The Wall\\" to do it. <br /> <br />The obvious objection to \\"The Wall\\" is what has Roger Waters got to complain about.  Pink Floyd has already produced (at least) three well-received albums that decade, one of them one of the most insanely successful in history.  That Eastern Europeans should confuse the title of this with the Berlin wall certainly shows a lack of proportion, does it not?  Why should we care about the self-pity and solipsism of a wealthy rock-star?  Well, first, because it is not all his fault.  Waters/Pink is an orphan.  Dying at Anzio is no doubt better more productive than dying on the Somme, but it doesn't make being orphaned any happier.  British education can be horribly life-denying and petty.  There is good reason for Waters to be terrified at the prospect of nuclear war in \\"Goodbye Blue Skies.\\"  After all, the cold war was an enormous gamble, and as Iraq shows, not all \\"realist\\" or neoconservative gambles work.  Secondly, it's not as if perfect maturity and mental health was or is the default setting of our modern world.  If people's marriages fall apart, if their families are claustrophobic, if they are full of impotent and not so impotent rage and hatred, it's not as if we could simply pride ourselves onour superior morality and ignore them.  Lovelessness and solipism are not simply Waters' fault. <br /> <br />Third, the music's great.  Waters' and Gilmour's voices are perfect for the roles they play, the one self-pitying, guilty, spiteful, and angry, the other blandly horrible in an especially British way.  There is a certain evil reality in such lyrics as \\"Cold as a razor blade, tight as a tournequet/dry as a funeral drum\\" as they describe despair better than anything else.  There are the opening bars, with a certain false lightness, of \\"Nobody Home.\\"  There is a real insight in the  desperation, and authentic misogyny, of \\"Don't Leave Me Now.\\"  \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" is brief, but heartbreaking.  There is the heartbreaking \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" as beautiful childhood experience is purged from the memory, and there is the threat of fascism in \\"Run Like Hell.\\"  There are the ominious (perfect!) undertones of \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part One\\". But there are few seconds as powerful as the last bars of \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives,\\" where the crescendo of imperial glory crashes into the nightmare of Britian in 1979.  There should have been another way, but since there wasn't \\"The Wall\\" is the best way to end the seventies.

No problem, wean them from JoJo and Good Charlotte with this updated version (even the cover channels Aerosmith). <br /> <br />Oh, one more thing: skip the faux Beatles-cum Oasis, Pink Floydish, and G'n'R/Black Crowes wussy ballads that are sprinkled in here.

So, what do the guys do?<br /><br />They ROCK.  With the exception of the long and somewhat sappy Paul Stanley ballad, \\"I Still Love You\\", the music on this album is among the heaviest and darkest the band has ever done, up to \\"Carnival of Souls\\".  \\"I Love it Loud\\" is a wall-shaking avalanche of metal-radio-friendly arena rock, and the title cut is a born concert-opener.<br /><br />Strangely, although Ace's face is on the cover, and songwriter Vinnie Cusano would become Vinnie Vincent for the next two KISS tours, a LONG list of uncredited guitarists was recruited here to mask the fact that Frehley had left.  Steve Ferris, Steve Lukather, Saraya's Tony Bruno, fusion guitarist Robben Ford, and even Eddie Van Halen stood in line (although Eddie never got to play a note here either).<br /><br />Producer Michael James Jackson assisted Eric Carr in pumping up his drum sound to earthquake level.  Best Cuts for drummers to get their ears melted off include \\"Creatures of the Night\\", \\"I Love it Loud\\", and the vastly underrated \\"War Machine\\" (close your eyes and imagine the war scenes from \\"Heavy Metal\\" playing with this in the background).<br /><br />\\"Keep Me Comin'\\" almost doesn't fit-- the rhythm is right, but the lyrics could have been swiped from an old David Lee Roth demo.<br /><br />Not the classic band of \\"Alive!\\" or \\"Love Gun\\", but if you like LOUD, crowd-pleasing music, this one's for you.
0802130208|5.0|This is one of the best written, funniest books I have ever read.   I have read it twice.  The first time I loved it, the second time I loved it more.
B00003CXIP|5.0|When \\"Stand By Me\\" came out in 1986, I was eleven years old. I don't know if I felt a bond with this movie because I was about the same age of the kids in it. Or if it was the fact that I would have loved to just go on 2-day trip to find a dead body like they did. What I did know, was that I loved this movie. <br /> <br />It just has a certain feel to it that makes you think back to your childhood or how you can relate to it when you are that age. I am 28 yrs. old now and I have seen this movie many times. When I saw it back in '86, I could relate to how the kids felt and we acting in the movie. When I watch it today, it's more a reflection on my childhood. It is a movie that has stood the test of time and everyone I have met loves this movie. <br /> <br />The movie is set in the 1950's. It's a story about four young friends who hear about a dead body that was left in the woods. They get the idea of making a trip (on foot) to go see it. They want to get their names in the paper and be heroes. What preceeds to happen is a coming of age quest that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br />The movie is based off of a Stephen King short story called, \\"The Body\\". I have always thought King's work was a bit overrated. This is my favorite of his stories. The film shows what kind of crazy trouble these four kids can get into along the way. It also shows the bonding experience this trip becomes as they start to realize who they really are. They swear, smoke cigarettes, play with a gun, escape from a junkyard, get leeches all over their body, narrowly escape getting hit by a train and more. There are so many scenes in this movie, that just bring me back to when I was 11 and watching this flick. <br /> <br />Rob Reiner does a great job in getting these four young actors to play these characters perfectly. This was Reiner's first big  hit and it was a surprise. He has since went on to become a very good director. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Cory Feldman, and Jerry O'Connellare amazing in their roles. After seeing this movie so many times, I can't picture anyone else that would have fit better to play these parts. They carry the movie and it's a shame that Phoenix had to die before he hit his prime. Out of the four, you can just see the talent beaming off of him. Kiefer Sutherland plays a great badguy. He just has a way about him that you could see him being a creep in real life. For only being seventeen, it showed that he would go on to bigger things. Richard Dryfuss does the narrating and makes a couple of appearances. He does a great job of telling the story through the eyes of Wil Wheaton's character. Like the kids, I honestly couldn't see, or hear, anyone else play that role. John Cusak even has a cameo as Wheaton's brother. <br /> <br />This is just one of those movies that everyone loves and enjoys. It brings back many memories and is an amazing flick. Sure some of the scenes are a bit childish (like the Barfarama scene), but that is the point. If you are one of the few people how haven't seen this, run out and buy this DVD right now. You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />Special Features: There is a very good commentary from Rob Reiner. He not only tells some interesting information, but also some stories about making the film and dealing with the young actors. I wish they would have got Wheaton, Feldman, and O'Connell to get in on it, as well. Next up is a great documentary about the making of the movie. It has interviews with the cast, director, and even Stephen King. A music video, trailers, and talent files round out the supplements.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Dogville... I saw it when it first came out on DVD and it took me a few days to watch it, but I haven't been able to get it out of my head ever since. I admit it, at first I was stunned. Where's the set? Is this a joke? When is the introduction over and the actual movie begin? Well, the lack of \\"structure\\" on the set was hard to get over. Yes, the houses and shrubery are painted to a black stage with white paint. There are no closed structures in the film. Except for some furniture, Dogville is an open book.     The film begins with an introduction to the characters and the arrival of the always stunning Nicole Kidman as Grace. You understand Dogville before she arrives and her arrival affects the very nature of the small mountain town. There is the inevitable love story between Grace and Tom Edison, (Paul Bettany) the town's idealistic philospher. The relationship they share in the film has more dimension than any movie out right now.     However, paradise is never as good as it seems and as Dogville begins to stir, Grace is stripped of her innocence and humanity. The subversive nature of man begins to emerge and I appreciated its relevance to culture today. Not just American culture, this isn't a bitter Danish filmmaker sending hate mail to the Americas. Dogville tells the story of mankind and the fact that dominate members of society have been taking advantage of the weak since the beginning of time.     Also, the supporting cast is incredible. Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skarsgard, Chloe Sevigny, Jeremy Davies, James Caan, Ben Gazzara. Patricia Clarkson... and the list goes on.     This is a beautiful film. If you can weather its minimalist approach and appreciate all the barriers that AREN'T standing between you and Dogville, I think you will feel the movie long after it concludes.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Well here it is the best zombie movie ever made in its own box set with every version ever made.  The only thing sweeter than this would be a complete Romero Dead series box set.  The sets content is excellent and the construction of the box set is very nice and complete.  Great set, and every complete version of the best zombie movie ever, what more is there to say get this now.
B000003FD9|5.0|As always, opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these Bach cello suites.  Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not \\"technically perfect\\", but in many ways, his most mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a Mercury copy of \\"the perfect\\" rendition; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his humanistic understanding of music, and of life.
B000063DFN|5.0|With their release of Powerslave (1984) Iron Maiden have made a claim for the greatest metal album ever created. And in my honest opinion? They succeeded, with no one song a bore, Powerslave was what got me into Maiden, and it is a true and utter classic.  <br /> <br />The album begins with one of the greatest openers of all time Aces High. The video begins with Churchill's speech and then descends into a metal classic with air-raid guitars and an awesome voice displayed by Bruce Dickinson. <br /> <br />Two-Minutes to Midnight is one of the catchiest songs ever, and had me yelling out the chorus over and over until the neighbours had enough and moved out. <br /> <br />Powerslave, with the egyptian mythology theme is a powerful song, the chorus grabbing you by the throat and not letting you go. <br /> <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is my absolute favourite Iron Maiden song ever, a 13-minute epic that retells the glory of the Samuel Taylor Coleridges epic poem, and this song is a rollercoaster of a ride, with no one part boring. The song finishes leaving wondering why, even clocking in at 13:36 why it couldn't have gone longer. <br /> <br />Musically, this is one of Maiden's finest and was only eclipsed by another of their albums, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. <br /> <br />Overall, an undeniable classic, worthy of anyone's CD collection.
B00005JMAH|2.0|This movie, while I admit the actual theatrical performance was good, did not resemble the book as most people have said.  I think that if you make a movie about a book, it should be more like the book.  The director for the movie added too many different aspects that did not fit the Harry Potter storyline.  I loved the books, but the movie needs some definite help.  People have said that the Lord of the Rings movies are too long, but they follow the story which is why they are so loved.  This edition of Harry Potter could have been much more loved by the public if it followed the book a bit more closely.  The movie was a good movie, but it was not a good Harry Potter movie.
038073186X|4.0|I'm new to mystery novels, but this one was very good.  Fast paced, interesting, kept me guessing about 3/4 of the way through.  I couldn't put this book down.  My only complaint would be it is unoriginal, but that's ok because it's a good example of how to do it the right way.
B0002IU988|5.0|creed, eat dust, this album and band is way better, auctally has fairly nice solos and riffs that bring back some classic rock... led zep and black sabbath, but still keeping that creed hard rock touch to it... perfect
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I read a fair sampling of the reviews here and decided to take a chance on this CD because most seem to be solid four and five star reviews.  Boy, did I make a mistake!!!  There's no way this disc deserves any more than two stars and I'm probably being generous in giving it that.  This band is in desperate need of a lead guitar player. The rare attempts at playing anything that remotely resembles a decent lead guitar lick are laughable on this disk.  At times they do sound like some of the groups others have mentioned, but never as good as any of them. If this band last for four albums or more I'd be very, very surprised. I just don't hear enough talent on this disc to make me think they can put out more than one or two more CD's before everybody looses interest in them.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I don't really know what he is talking about half the time and when the waters become a little too deep (the subsequent Holywood) it turns me away, but this CD is a defining moment in lessons on how rock can seem dead in your heart, and then boom something comes a long and reminds you of how it felt when you discovered how rock music can move you inside. Essentially a collection of bitter sweet glammed out rock gems there is not one song that won't challenge you to think either whilst sporting a broad grin or a frown. On a musical landscape there is nothing really that new here, perhaps Bowie being the most relevant comparsion. It feels alien and futuristic in its delivery which places a new slant but doen't also forget to entertain in the right measures. Ultimately Manson's last album to date that is both commercial and artistically challenging it begs the question will it ever be this good again? We can only wait with baited breath. How long can you hold your breath for?
0060916540|5.0|What a gripping true life story.  The single most extraordinary tale of individual survival I have ever read.  Inspiring in the shear will to live.
0316666343|5.0|This book was original and thoughtful and I would recommend it to anyone.  I read a few reviews where it was stated \\"lost interest, written for a movie, etc. and I did not lose interest at all.  I kept it throughout and believe me I am one to lose interest.  I felt this book was very interesting, written from the perspective of a dead girl, it was the story of her healing and the healing of those who loved her.  It sounded real to me, how the mother could not cope, how the father tried.  The father seems like some kind of hero particularly when the mother left, but being a mother myself I realize Susie's death hit no one harder than the mother, it was all she could do to barely cope with the situation, to just get by.  But thank goodness the father stepped up to the plate, I think the mother hoped for that to happen.  And the portrayel of the little brother was right on. <br /> <br />Original, engaging, enduring. <br /> <br />I loved this book.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Buy this album. It is simply one of the most intimate, heartfelt, and schmaltzy discs I've ever heard. The mood remains warm and intimate throughout, as does the recorded sound. The songs have a slightly homogenous feel about them, and this makes the disc work  as a unified whole in the same way as Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\". It also means it sits very comfortably in repeat-all mode on my CD player. Jarrett gives a sustained display of impeccable musicianship, touch, and rubato. Also, for a change, he doesn't sympathetically grunt or yelp at all. People who are not musicians will not fully appreciate how difficult it is to make an instrument with hammers sing with such sweetly sustained lyricism as Jarrett achieves through the whole disc. I agree with other reviewers who singled out \\"Shenandoah\\" as a particular glory amongst many: it's simply exquisite. This is the ideal accompaniment to relax to on a winter's night with good wine and good company.
0451196716|5.0|This often overlooked story is probably one of King's best works.  I have read it several times...a very, very haunting story and a real page turner.  Character developement is wonderful.  Wish more of this author's work was of equal quality (not that most of his stuff is bad, it's just that some is much better than others?.  Thank you Mr. King.
B00005MEW1|1.0|Seems like a good idea at first, to combine old visual with a modern audio.  <br />Anyhow - it doesn't work. The 1920's interpretation has it's time-stamp, which is unique, unrepeatable, unreachable at any other time  ...  <br />Adding an industrial mix sounds to me just like a poor wash-pan-attempt of a couple of people, to parasite on a classic. Very simmilar to the puppets' \\"Hard Day's Night\\" given in Prague for foreigner.  <br />My personal recomendation is - just walk it by. <br />I've ben force to rate i 1 star. IMHO - zero would suit better.
B000089CJI|5.0|Personally I find this album breathtaking. Fun synth pop at times (Such Great Heights), gushing strings that break your heart on other tracks (Recycled Air). The end track that's drum and bass influenced just sticks in your head for days and inspires a nonstop smile. I liken the sound to the melodies of The Cars with the synthpop sensibilities of every great 80s band, and the song lyrics that you wish you could have written at age 15 when a boy named Brian or a girl named Lula broke your heart. For anyone who's ever lost young love, this is the album to confront your sadness head on and be born a stronger and more radiant being. Bravo Postal Service, you've made a gentle and beautiful album that speaks for me and no doubt countless others.
B000002J0P|4.0|I'm writting this not to review the album itself.  Other reviewers have done a fine job of representing this as one of CSN's best and a must have 60's folk/rock album.  I agree on all points, and the remastering quality is superb.<br /><br />I have to take away one star though.  I went to pop this disc into my MAC to burn the songs to my iTunes playlist and make a mixed CD with some other CSN material I have.  Errrr--nope.  The CD would not mount on my computer.  I gave it to a co-worker and he was able to mount it on his PC just fine.  There is even a neat artsy little CD track player interface.  I then popped another CD into my MAC and it mounted fine.  Back to CSN...no good.  It will not play on MACs.<br /><br />I can only assume this is some misguided attempt to stop piracy, but I find it very annoying.  In the age of the iPod, it seems like the folks at Atlantic have struck a deal with Microsoft and are now anti-MAC.<br /><br />If you have a PC or won't be playing it on a computer, get this album, the remastered audio is excellent.  If you want to play it on a MAC, sorry, you're out of luck.
B0000029GA|5.0|From start to finish, Illmatic will captivate you with the most vivid, raw depictions of Nas' life in the ghetto.  Nas' lyrical wizardry on this album of 1994 is ahead of its time and even stands up to the best efforts of today.  His mastery with polysyllabic rhyme schemes goes beyond \\"big words,\\" combining several smaller words to maintain similar sound.  The beats are purposely minimalist, grimey, and flat-out dirty to emphasize the tone Nas is shooting for in conveying his message.  The moment you hear the bassline on \\"NY State of Mind\\" hit and the piano keys grinding up the sound waves, you will be warped.   <br /> <br />While some would like to think Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt is one of the greatest albums ever, I personally don't think it can hold a candle to Illmatic.  This truly is a musical gem, regardless of genre.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is a must have album, not just for pianist or for those who love Alicia Keys, but for all. The album itself is packed with great songs. The best part about the Diary of Alicia Keys is the albulm layout. The songs flow just like a diary, a progression of experience and growth. It's so good, you play the cd on repeat withou losing a beat. Be careful though, play this when you are a little tired (between tracks 5 and 7) and you will fall asleep.
0385335482|5.0|What an airhead!  The stream of consciousness is a laugh-a-minute as Rebecca succumbs to sale after sale while endeavoring to dig her way out of debt. <br />You see the disasters coming, but the hapless heroine plows right ahead making things worse.  She struggles to maintain her poise and facade at work where she is totally inept and in social situations where she manages time after time to put her foot in it. <br />Amazingly this comedy of errors finally works out right.  Lots of fun.
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist really knows how to get under your skin.  My first experience with this movie was when I was 10 years old and it was on television on a Sunday evening.  My bedtime was 9.30pm and I was allowed to watch the first hour and then I had to go to bed. Now those who have seen this movie appreciate that that it's at around this time into the movie that all the scares start to come. To go to bed at this time was very unnerving. My older brother whom I shared a room with would then reenact scenes for the next week or so and scare the living daylights out of me. <br /> <br />This happended repeatedly until I managed to see the entire thing in full on video several years later. This movie is unnerving, complex and petrifying.  It lingers with you long after you have watched it. You find yourself staring into the bathroom mirror and fear that if you stared for too long your reflection would turn into the devil. Oohh it just gets under your skin. <br /> <br />When this version got released with the documentary on the end I must admit that a lot was taken away once you learn how they did everything. It kind of demystifies everything and is no longer that scary to me. <br /> <br />But wow, what a brilliant movie! <br /> <br />P.S Buy this one instead of the newer version!
0345357116|4.0|Anyone who claims to be a Tolkien buff should read this once. Twice would really be a test. It certainly does not flow and hold your interest like The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings -- it was not meant to. You have to remember that this is a book of mostly haphazard, disconnected notes with a few interesting stories found here and there, so it's kind of like hunting for treasure on the Dagorlad Plain. The treasure's there, but there is also lots of bracken and scraps to wade through to find it. <br /> <br />I happily read The Hobbit and the Rings Trilogy once every two or three years (and have for the past 35 years), but once is enough for this book. Again the Tolkien buff -- especially the true Tolkien trivia buff with lots of reading time -- will appreciate this one. All others will probably not finish it.
B00005N91B|5.0|A sexy thriller with good performances and nice direction and cinematography. <br /> <br />This is the best thing Sharon Stone has done on film to date I think. <br /> <br />Extra bonus features are good and the ice pick pen is a cute touch!

These two pieces in particular generate several laugh out loud moments. Both of these have also been adapted for the stage and are also available to buy. <br /> <br />I have re read 'Seasons Greetings...etc' three times and each time I am tickled pink.   <br /> <br />A good stocking filler!

B000002ULO|5.0|Having recently bought this album, I can honestly say it is the only one of McCartney's that comes even close to those of The Beatles. I enjoy a lot of his solo work, but never have I discovered an album that I ENTIRELY ENJOY. On all the others there are the crappy samey songs that obviously either seemed like a good idea at the time or just show a lack of imagination.  <br /> <br />This one is different. \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" is a remarkabley simple song, yet brilliant. \\"Somedays\\" could quite easily appear on a Beatles album, with Lennon singing backing vocals. In fact in reminds me strongly of \\"For No One\\" or \\"She's Leaving Home\\". \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Little Willow\\" also recall the greatness of the Beatles, and with Ringo on backing vocals on \\"Beautiful Night\\" it is as close to Beatles perfection as Mcartney has ever got, or is likely to get. His more recent efforts simply do not compare.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Wow! Is this even the same band, I dont even know how the whole band had contribution in this cd. theres hardly any mixing in it no 3 drummmers at the same time pounding away, I think there making a solid attempt for mainstream, its not working. the cd's alright, I bought Cuz im a big follower, but its not what you'd expect from slipknot, I would however recommend the new machine head though.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Jesus has always been controversial, and the 1000+ plus reviews here prove that.  Mel Gibson's Passion is the most powerful adaptation of the last hours of Christ available from Hollywood.  As a Christian, Gibson has the best perspective that a producer can have when filming a movie about Jesus, and Gibson's own faith comes across in every scene. <br /> <br />Yes, the film is violent.  But crucifixion was never pretty.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next is a classic album, specially when they released their new catalog with all remastered recordings and bonus tracks in their special deluxe edition. This album could'nt have sounded any better as this one. This CD has a richer sound than the 1984 release on CD.  I really think the bonus tracks are a treat for the collector. Disc Two includes a live performence from The Vic show this performence is great. I know this Deluxe Edition will be a treat for any young, old who fan looking to capture the best quality, with some fine bonus material on one. Wow~!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Since Katsuhiro Otomo's breakthrough anime movie \\"Akira\\" (for its cell animation and superb tale of Armageddon), a string of other good and worth watching movies bring audiences around the world to other anime features like \\"Ninja Scroll\\" (for its blend of action & horror), \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" (for its sci-fi originality), \\"Metropolis\\" (for its first digital animation & cell animation), \\"Spirited Away\\" (for its childlike fairy tale meant for children around the world), \\"Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade\\" (for its political tale of revolution) & \\"Escaflowne\\" (for its fantasy, adventure & romance). <br /> <br />But on a rare occasion, comes a modern day epic adventure from creative director Satoshi Kon's \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\". <br /> <br />The title may make you think that his movie must be about gangsters. It isn't at all. It's about 3 homeless people that left their past behind, only a chance that they found an abandon baby takes them on an epic journey of life, pain, laughter, fate & coincidences that makes you believe between the days of Christmas & New Year... miracles do happen. <br /> <br />I have yet to watch any of Satoshi Kon's anime feature, but his 3rd movie has won me all over and this is one anime feature you must have, whether you're an anime fan or not, is worth putting this DVD on your shelve as a collection. It may not have an English Dub, but it's not really that bad to read the subtitles while watching the movie. And with Christmas around the corner, try this new classic. <br />
0375432302|3.0|Some time ago, I read a statement about the difference between bestseller and best writer. This book is a strong instance. Even if it is arguable on so many sides, it represents nonetheless an amusing and capturing reading. But, in a sense, I have found it deceiving. As a first, a main rule in a fiction book requires that the reader shall have the same action visibility of protagonists. That rule has been systematically broken: the author refers continuously to elements the characters see, or recurs to their memories, whose explanation is postponed, sometimes after several chapters. For example, in the initial part, inside Louvre, every time a message is mentioned, the thread is interrupted, the focus is moved to a parallel one (there are ever three or four at the same time), and only when it is retrieved the description is completed. This suspension is an easy trick to increase reader's curiosity, but made me feeling a sense of incumbent delay, artificially and purportedly created, respect to the narrative flow. Nothing bad: even Conan Doyle often omitted a complete context definition, appending later additional information, but that technique causes a really different impression when used in a novel more than in short tales. As an extreme comparison, you can think how appalling can result a crime book where the guilty turns out to be a chap never mentioned before. I found that basic rule usually respected by other good bestseller authors, e.g. JK Rowling or Robert Harris, just to limit examples.<br /><br />Of course, you cannot ignore the huge, but very few accurate and very superficial, cultural background Brown builds to support the fast pacing action. A pinch of mathematical games, cryptography, a bit more art, a lot of history (mostly fictionalised) yields a highly refined recipe, which has turned out very good to sell.<br /><br />A comic side effect of the novel is the mass of erudite criticisms that have been written about. Those critics seem to be the only people to take the Holy Grail story seriously, worrying about confute it and pouring an endless list of references and episodes (which any navigator can find however in the Net). Naturally, authors dealing with such a subject have not many opportunities to get some visibility, so you must be comprehensive. But, considering also that, with a treachery far subtler than their textual analysis, they reveal most of the plot, you are better off reading their reviews AFTER you have read the novel.<br /><br />On the other side, Dan Brown could have spared the allegedly historical introducing remark, whose claiming about reality of Priory of Sion is at least dubious (i.e. manifestly wrong), and which misses also the actual nature of controversies that invested Opus Dei, which has been involved more in financial scandals than accusations of brainwashing or dangerous practices.<br /><br /> So, concluding, a Cartland-like thriller, superficial, exaggerate, an editorial firework, fast-pacing, sometimes ridiculous, a pleasant reading to pass time, but nothing remarkable.take the Holy Grail story seriously, worrying about confute it and pouring an endless list of references and episodes (which any navigator can find however in the Net).

0783225792|2.0|I am a big fan of \\"Goodfellas\\", although I usually watch my tv-edited version, with toned-down violence and language.  Who needs that stuff?  Because of this, I was eager to see the movie's sequel, \\"Casino\\"; I was full of curiosity to see what had happened to the mobsters since the last movie.   <br /> <br />My suspicions were immediately raised when I began watching the opening credits: no Ray Liotta.  He was such a big part of the last movie, I was surprised he was neither included nor mentioned in this one.  I was also surprised to see Joe Pesci included, since it didn't seem like he'd be around for the sequel, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />On the whole, while it feels good to be back with these characters again, the whole thing seems like a cash-in.  I think I'll just stick with Goodfellas, and leave Casino to the real fans.

Not only can he write his own lyrics and rap them well, he makes awesome beats that are used by some of the best in the biz. The only bad part is that there aren't that many guest appearances, except by Twista and Jamie Foxx and a couple others. But this guy is GOOD! With all the commercial rap nowadays about cars, women and money, Kanye West brings his own style that is quite welcome into the hip hop culture. He talks about Jesus, the society, and many other thought-provoking subjects. If you don't have this album then you MUST get it now! You'll be amazed at his awesome flow, lyrics, and beats. BTW, best song is definitely \\"All Falls Down\\".
B000002P74|5.0|this one is really worth the buy. i think that this is one of the best albums they ever did. all of these songs just kick it, i have the original album. with only 8 songs you can bet this one would be worth it.
0394827996|5.0|Fish Is Fish (Lionni, 1970) describes a fish who is keenly interested in learning about what happens on land, but the fish cannot explore land because it can only breathe in water. It befriends a tadpole who grows into a frog and eventually goes out onto the land. The frog returns to the pond a few weeks later and reports on what he has seen. The frog describes all kinds of things like birds, cows, and people. The book shows pictures of the fish's representations of each of these descriptions: each is a fish-like form that is slightly adapted to accommodate the frog's descriptions--people are imagined to be fish who walk on their tailfins, birds are fish with wings, cows are fish with udders. This tale illustrates both the creative opportunities and dangers inherent in the fact that people construct new knowledge based on their current knowledge.
B00000JNO2|4.0|this is a pretty good album. i really enjoy listening to it. the skynyrd band has been through so much sadness. its a wonder they stay'd together this long. but i guess its the promise johnny made to ronnie. my favorite song on here is gimmie back my bullets that song will always rock. some other great songs on here as well. its kinda slow on ronnies vocals seems like they would have done better on mixing dont ya think
1577311523|5.0|Every now and then you come across a book that really has an impact on your life and the capacity to change how you view yourself and the world around you.

If you are interested in living your life being aware and at peace with yourself and everything in the world, this is the book for you.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|By far one of the best films ever.  Excellent choice of actors.  Incredibly realistic fight scenes.  If possible i would give it 1,000,000,000,000,000 stars!
B00005JGAF|5.0|Album Three for the Ramones, Rocket to Russia, is the Ramones album that SHOULD have made the Ramones a household name.  Of course, it didn't....Nothing ever really went the way they should have for the Ramones!  But honestly, this record is hit single after hit single.  Only problem is that no one bought it....  Well, now you have the chance to rectify that situation.  BUY IT NOW!  RTR is just one long (well, 33 minute) hit parade for the listener.      Johnny Ramone, who was not much for interviews, would always claim RTR was the Ramones best album.  (He never said his \\"favorite\\", he always said \\"our best\\")  When asked why it was the best, Johnny would always answer, \\"It had the most hits.\\" Well....the Ramones never had any hits, so it's hard to determine what Johnny meant.  I figure he meant it had the most \\"hit\\" songs with the fans.  If you look at the album, really only 4 of the 14 tunes weren't staples of the Ramones live set.  That says a lot for any album!  This album contains the Ramones best song, Sheena is a Punk Rocker.  (Which also was included in later issues of Leave Home).  Their ode to 60's rock, Ramones style, it is infectious.  It also contains major Ramones \\"hits\\" Rockaway Beach, Cretin Hop, and Teenage Lobotomy.  Cover tune, Do You Wanna Dance is here as well.  You may remember it from the movie Rock n' Roll High School, as the Bruddas and students began their assault on the halls of Vince Lombardi High!    This would be the last album with the original four Ramones.  Tommy would leave in favour of Marky, and take over the duties of a producer.  Some fans call this the end of the \\"great Ramones\\", but it was only the begining!  Road to Ruin would be next, and RTR is just a warm up.  But, it is the third in a terrific string of albums which you should have already!  BUY IT!!!!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Finally the original Star Wars trilogy is on DVD! But from the arguement on both sides of the table, my generation isn't satisfied. As Vader said, \\"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\\" From my vantage point, I have the \\"original\\" original Episode IV - A New Hope, my sister has the 1st remastered trilogy, I also have the 2nd remastered gold trilogy and 3rd remastered \\"special edition\\" trilogy with the new scenes and CGI effects. I agree with my generation's side on Solo v.s Greedo scene. George Lucas should've left it alone. As for the Moss Isley scene, they missed Lucas's point on why he wanted more people and activity in it compared to how the \\"original\\" scene was. Back in 1976, the studio execs were rushing George on a deadline for Episode IV's release. He didn't have the technology and materials to make Episode IV completed the way he envisioned it. Although over 90% of Episode V and VI were done, but the remaining portion had to be added with new scenes and CGI.<br /><br />Yes the prequels didn't meet every Star Wars fans' expectations due to the lack of story writing. But that's meant for the new fans who have to keep going back watching the original trilogy after Episode I and II to know how the story and characters are connected.<br /><br />And from what I'm hearing is this dvd trilogy has scenes with Christen Hayden replacing a previous actor's scenes as Darth Vader? Or is it the trailor that's been extended with scenes from Episode I and II to go with IV, V, and VI?<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm adding this new dvd trilogy to my collection and seeing how Star Wars has evolved in 27 years. As for the rest of you fans, make your own decisions.<br /><br />May the Force be with us.
0385510438|4.0|In 1970, when 23 year old Willie Traynor took over the ownership of a small town newspaper in Tennessee, he reported the brutal rape and murder of a young widow, attacked in her own home and in front of her children. Before she died, she named Danny Padgitt, a member of a notorious local family as her attacker. At the end of his trial, Padgitt threatened revenge on any of the jurors who found him guilty and, when two of those jurors die as the result of foul play, feelings run high in the town. Willie befriends one of the jurors, Callie Ruffin, an articulate and religious black lady, mother os seven college professors, and one who would find difficulty in casting a \\"guilty\\" vote where it would involve the death sentence. Danny Padgitt IS found guilty but, because of the voting of the jurors, is sentenced to a life term which, in Tennessee in those days, meant that he would be released in about 10 years. Wilie settles down comfortably into the life of a small town dweller and dramatically increases the circulation of the newspaper, merging easily into the towns' collection of diverse and colourful characters. I'm sure that this could make a wonderful movie!
B000000HHE|5.0|This is truly an amazing album.  It is one of those albums that dazzles you upon it's first listen and it keeps you hooked.  De La's sampladelic technique is an absolute marvel and is rivalled only by the Beastie Boys' \\"Paul's Boutique.\\"  Not only is this album loaded with amazing production values (thanks to Prince Paul) it's also filled to the brim with one great track after another, almost all of which contain postive messages so rarely seen in rap music.  Tracks like \\"Jenifa Taught Me,\\" \\"Ghetto Thang,\\" \\"Buddy,\\" \\"Plug Tunin',\\" and \\"Eye Know\\" are the highlights of the album, the latter being probably the most innocent love song in all of hip-hop history.  De La also keeps the album fresh by putting in some memorable skits and never seem to misfire.  An excellent investment of one's money, \\"3 Ft High and Rising\\" is a classic that should not be overlooked.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I first heard about this album when when I saw an article about a concert where Dylan was \\"rockin' out.\\" I thought \\"Dylan... rockin' out???\\" I went to the online service and it has become a regular of mine. From the very first song to the very last, I have been astounded with the words, the music, the rhythms, the musicianship.  What a way to celebrate your sixties! <br />Go, Bobby, go!
0446310786|5.0|I think I'm the only person who didn't read this in high school. I don't know why, but I was expecting a boring, plodding story. To the contrary, this is a quick, fun, easy read. Telling the story through the innocent eyes of a young girl perfectly points out the corruption and backwards views in the small southern town without judging it. I also thought it was in some way encouraging to know that Lee wrote this one book, the classic it is, and nothing else.
B0002I831S|1.0|What a great idea - three box sets to chronicle the beginning of STAR TREK through to its third and final season of it's original \\"five year-mission!\\"  But wait - there's something missing!  Oh yes, that would be the true beginning of STAR TREK, Gene Roddenberry's unsold pilot, \\"The Cage.\\"  Hmmm...guess that means we'll have to shell out for that one separately...
0156027321|5.0|It takes a little bit to get into this one. I know a few people who read a couple chapters then quit, and they're missing out. This is seriously one of the best books I've read in a long time. Maybe one of my top ten. A fun, gut-wrenching, funny, sad, insightful, moving, well-written story about a Muslim-Christian-Hindu Indian boy stranded on a life raft with a tiger for eight months at sea. How exactly that happens is part of the fun of the novel, so I won't spoil it. I'll just say that the narrator is instantly likable. He reminds me of Richard Halliburton (if you like travel writing, check him out), with an enthusiasm and love for everything. An enthusiasm that makes you want to love everything. And the argument the book makes for religion is wonderful without being preachy. Great great great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never found it in me to care much about Buffy or Angel, so when my neighbor invited me to watch Firefly, a cancelled sci-fi/western series by the same guy, I wasn't enthused.  By the first ten minutes, though, I was hooked....and after seeing the whole series only twice, I want to own it. <br /> <br />I've read through the few negative reviews posted here.  A few people just seem to hate Joss Whedon and anything he's ever made;  others seem to suffer from the preconception that sci-fi has to look and behave like the other series they've seen. <br /> <br />A major beef seems to be the Old West look of much of Firefly.  Personally, I find the mix of low- and high-tech completely believable.  It IS noted in the series, however briefly, that the Alliance is prone to dumping settlers on new planets with only the barest minimum of supplies.  When the series visits the Core worlds of the Alliance, though, the technology is everything you'd expect of a futuristic society.  In the Core, you have the clean, fancy cities and laser guns and whatever else;  and out in the colonies, you have whatever spare parts and table scraps people were left with...and that's where the crew of the Serenity happen to be spending most of their time.  It's very much a haves/have-nots situation, which I don't see the passage of a few centuries doing much to alter, honestly. <br /> <br />Some of the other reviewers object to the lack of aliens in the series (one even goes so far as to list this as one of the ways Firefly takes the \\"science\\" out of sci-fi....I wasn't aware the existence of alien life was scientifically proven).  To me, this is utterly refreshing.  Come on, look at any of the Star Treks, or Farscape, or Babylon 5:  most of the \\"aliens\\" are mostly humanoid types with lots of latex molds and paint.  I mean, sure, I like Farscape and B5 as much as the next fan, but really--what are the odds that the universe could generate that many species who look SO much like us?  In a way, theprevalence of aliens in every other series makes Firefly very original for asking the question:  What if we ARE alone in the universe?   <br /> <br />In the end, the reason that Firefly doesn't set up a society that's all that much different from our current one, and stays away from the latex-headed aliens, is that it's about people.  Specifically, about a group of people who couldn't have more different backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences, all of whom are crammed into one tiny little ship and asked to live together--or maybe just put up with each other--for a long, long time.  The interplay between the characters, and the effects their adventures have on them, are the real story here. <br /> <br />If you can't get past the intrusion of Old West archetypes into your sci-fi, or the lack of the same old genre conventions that every other sci-fi show does to death, then....well, I'll let Mal and Zoe say it for me. <br /> <br />Mal : You are very much lacking in imagination.  <br />Zo : I imagine that's so, sir.  <br /> <br />As for the rest of you....see you at the movie!  :)
0312305060|5.0|I must admit, I did not like the movie much. I thought the movie was disturbing and at times somewhat boring. I know, what a strange contradiction. But I decided to read the novel. And I was spellbound. Michael Cunningham's prose is some of the most beautiful I have ever read. It is extremely simple but overwhelmingly moving and beautiful to behold. This novel reads like a painting. Something to observe.  <br /> <br />I found the women to be quite strong in their way. Each reflections of their own era and though their lives were simple; each one had an interesting and full life.  <br /> <br />But what I liked most that this was a book that makes you see life in a different way. That all hours of a day is something intense and should not be squandered.
0156027321|5.0|This book starts out very slow.  We are introduced to Pi and his life in India.  I have to admit that the story is quite slow here and sometimes quite boring to read.  Be strong and keep on reading. <br /> <br />Once Pi and his family begin traveling the story picks up quite quickly.  From this point on the story is quite enjoyable.  It was worth the short bit of pain at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The ending of this book was a bit of a shock.  At one point I began expecting something weird but it was still quite memorable. <br /> <br />Some people have said that this book is about religion.  To be frank, I just don't see it.  Religion is definitely a topic of Pi's interest in the beginning but I don't think it is a major theme throughout the book.  <br /> <br />I don't think that you'll regret reading this book if you can struggle through the beginning.  At times, there are books that you feel a loss when you finish the book.  You feel like you are leaving friends behind when the book closes for the last time.  Pi is one of those characters.
B000002LQR|5.0|This my favorite album of all time and it changed my life in an extremely postive way. I love every minute. The Peppers combine rap, funk and hard rock to make a beautifully collaberated masterpiece.
B000002UA0|5.0|I really only like Pink Floyd during the Syd Barrett years.  All the rest is a bit dreary and pretentious.  This album glitters.
B000002MJC|5.0|After their best-seller Violator, Depeche Mode came back more powerful than ever with this album. <br /> <br />Incorpoating their trademark electronic sound with a more organic 'rock' style, the Mode achieved a heavier, yet uplifting atmosphere with each track. <br /> <br />Opening with the first single from the album, I Feel You has what singer Dave Gahan described as a \\"bluesy, rock and roll\\" sound - a strong indication that DM were, once again pushing their music in a different sonic direction. <br />Other notable tracks include: In Your Room - a slow-building epic track which, along with Mercy In You and Higher Love, leave you in a trance-like state from their 'big' sound. <br /> <br />The music isn't the only powerful aspect to the songs - Martin Gore's lyrics upon first listen, have a darkness to them but listen closely and you'll hear how they are also positive and very uplifting - one of the most intriguing things about Depeche Mode! <br /> <br />Certainly one of the 'top 3' albums in the DM catalogue - definitely worth purchasing.
B000274THQ|5.0|This film was more beautiful than I had imagined.  Daniel Brhl is such an emotional actor that it is actually believable that a son would go through so much trouble as to create an East Germany to keep his already ailing and formerly comatose mother from dying from shock.  The film is very sweet and charming, as all the supporting characters work like mad to keep the charade up for mother.  And Katrin Sa is convincing as an activist/protective mother whose life is turned upside down and she must be the one who is being taken care of.  All in all, it is a truly wonderful film with an original concept, which is something viewers haven't seen in a while (considering the amount of prequels, sequels, and remakes that are being released).  Don't be afraid of subtitles either.  Once you know the basic plot, they are easy to follow.
B000001DTM|4.0|Must admit, I'm more an fan of U2's 80's work for it's rockier, raw sound. However, Achtung Baby is by far their most creative - really pushing, not just their own sound in a new direction, but defined a new sound for the 90's. <br /> <br />Guitars, electronics, distorted vocals...\\"the works\\" is on this album. <br />On the surface,(as the album cover suggests) songs such as Zoo Station, The Fly and Until The End of the World may seem to be colourful and all glamour but listen to Bono's words as he sings and you'll realise there's a lot of substance there. The depth and power of Bono's songwriting hasn't, in any way, been lost in their new sound. In fact, one of their most popular tracks, One, is due to it's touching lyrics. <br /> <br />Despite all the technological effects on the album there are some moments which are reminiscent of earlier U2 -Bono's yearning vocals on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree can be heared on the track So Cruel which makes the already powerful lyrics even more compelling. <br />And The Edge's guitar style isn't all lost - Thy Fly captures some 'gutsy' guitar playing, so too does Until the End of the World and Mysterious Ways. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby was a great kick-start to the music scene in the 90's - it's an exciting and innovative album and an essential one in any U2 collection.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Blues have been around forever, but these 2 guys make 'em sound fresh!!!  Look for this one of your favorite crictics end of the year best list.  Well, on any crictic's best of 2004 list!!!
B000002LK1|5.0|While climbing up the success chart during the 80's, Depeche reached the top at the very end of the decade with their bestselling album, Violator. <br /> <br />Classic tunes crafted with dark lyrics has made this the band's best. Each song has its place - opening track World In My Eyes starts off with frontman Dave Gahan singing \\"Let me take you on a trip\\" - and this album does just that. <br /> <br />Sweetest perfection is 'twisted pop' unusual-sounding but infectious nevertheless. This is followed by their first single from the album Personal Jesus- with a stomping beat and blues-based guitar riffs, this is one of their most successful songs to date. <br />Fourth track Halo also has a heavy beat - made perfect to dance to (should have been a single!) <br />Then it's time to chill - Waiting For The Night is a soft, quiet track, sung beautifully... <br />But with track six it's time to move again. Enjoy the Silence is pop perfection - need I say more? It's their classic. <br />Policy of Truth has a catchy tune with equally catchy lyrics - you'll go away singing this one... <br />Blue Dress returns to a more softer sound - sung by songwriter Martin Gore and prepares you for <br />Clean - an eery sounding and very atmospheric track which closes the album.  <br /> <br />The only possible downfall with Violator is that there are only nine tracks on it. Several b sides to the singles from this album should have been included which are equally as good. <br /> <br />But as far as Depeche Mode's catalogue goes, this is the one to have - dark electronic music at it's best.  <br /> <br />Enjoy it.  <br /> <br />

B00005JKDQ|2.0|this movie involves monsters in the closet,something have been trying to rid our kids minds of for years.thats just stupid.thanks guys for carrying this sick tradition on!the story is about a whole other world filled with monsters.instead of electricity,theier world runs on screams collected from children at night.are you sure this is disney?it sounds more like stephen king.the top scream getter,a huge blue with purple polka dots guy accidentaly pulls a little girl back into monster world with him.well in monster world,she is considered toxic.sickisnt it?so all the government and people are on a manhunt for this helpless three year old girl.so he and his partner decide to save her.that fat guy from the tv show roseanne.they must have payed him good to put up with her all that time.shes one of the top 5 worst people on a tv show ever.i dont think its for kids myself.its not really all that good.theres a cool chamielion whos the bad guy.this movie sucks!thats the truth.
B000059ZLH|3.0|No need to comment on the performances. These guys rock, period. The DVD production isn't good. All those effects are annoying and although I can understand where Portnoy is comming from on deciding on those effects, I think they're very amateur looking and completely unecessary. <br /> <br />The sound is another shame in this DVD. Something as simple as compression -- yes, it's simple -- was overused and abused. I am a recording engineer and I can't believe they did such a crappy job on mixing this concert. It may have been captured wrong, maybe Kevin Shirley was drunk, who knows... <br /> <br />I watched this DVD two times just for the sake of it but the sound quality won't let me play it a trird time. <br /> <br />Hopefully the next DVD live in Tokio will be mixed by japanese engineers.
B00005LOUS|4.0|this movie was way off from the books.yes books,as in plural.there were very many dr suess books concerning the grinch.there never was a martha may.the grinch had environmental induced mental problems from his mother.the cat in the hat and the whos help him in the end.this movie tossed all that outthe window.that being said,in this one the grinch is tormented as a child by the mayor of whoville-as a kid too.one x-mas,the kids push him too far over a issue with his love interest martha may.so,he develops a serious disliking for x-mas and whos.as a matter of fact,he reads some of the phone book everyday.with each name he reads,he screams down from the mtn\\"I HATE YOU\\".its very disturbing if youre a who.he eats glass,sets out time to wallowin his self pity..................a very in depth character suffering from something very serious.jim carrey is the grinch.the kids will love it.its not quite as good as the cat in the hat but its really close.theres an old grinch movie from god only knows when that inspired this one.the old one is better i say.its at least true to one of the greatest characters ever.i think this is a very likeable movie everyone will like.i think the whos are obnoxious myself and very ugly.ithink ive made it quite clear that the only thing this has in common with the book is a tall green guy and he steals x-mas.this is jim carreys best performance of all time.the other best ones are bruce  in bruce almighty,the schizo in me myself and irene and andy kaufman.its an excellent movie.

B0001KU8ZG|4.0|well well well.here i am again.somebody in the sensitivity department said i couldnt keep my last review of this movie.iwonder why.anyhow,i will now use my 38 point system to review once again!being as how this is a tim burton movie,it goes without saying that this is a awesome movie.it goes like this.there is this old man dying.his estranged son comes back around to see him with his wife.the old man and his son never talk anymore due to the old mans use of tall tale type story telling.the son investigates the stories to discover his dad wasnt a compulsive liar but a person who enjoyed telling interesting stories.the giant from happy gilmore is in it.i think the kids will like it.it is about the 6th or 7thy best tim burton film,but that still ranks it far above most movies due to burtons dazzling brilliance in movie directing.its a film the whole family can enjoy.there are an emotional spot or two.it IS about a guy dying though.there is this neat looking siamese twin chick,who sings for the troops,i think in either nam or korea.the son in this movie is a ungrateful little punk who wasted his whole life being mad at his dad for always telling interesting stories so he didnt sound boring.all in all,its quite good.ALL HAIL TIM BURTON!THE GREAT DIRECTOR RULES ON!

B000063DGC|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl years ago, but somehow lost track of it. Perish the thought that it's probably someone's drink coaster now. Anyway, Randy Rhoads is someone who's legacy is always floating around somewhere in my mind no matter what I'm doing. He continues to inspire me on a level that goes way beyond mere labels like \\"heavy metal hero\\" or \\"rock guitar god.\\" As true fans know, when Randy was on the road the first thing he would do when the band pulled into a new city was to get a phone book, find a guitar teacher and arrange for a lesson. This from one of the most talented musicians ever, period. He was always learning and expanding his musical vocabulary. Randy Rhoads changed a lot of lives with his work and will continue to do so for generations to come. If that's not reason enough to buy this CD, well, I don't know what else to say. It speaks for itself.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|this movie is by pixar.it is set in the great barrier reef out by austrailia.nemo is going to his first day of fish school.he has one gimpy fin and so he runs into trouble.lets not forget that his mother and thoiusands of siblings are killed by a shark.that wasnt necessary.what the hell is wrong with disney anyway?whats thier fascination with making movies with dead family members?anyhow,nemo is lost from his dad.his dad goes on an epic journey to go find and rescue him.meanwhile,nemo is being followed around by this really stupid,fat girl fish with[literaly] a like 20 second memory span.actualy,if not for the way the movie pokes fun at 1)dead mom,2)dead  siblings,3) the disabled it would have got a 5 star rating.the scenery is breathtaking!it is one of pixars best!the kids really like it.just divert there attention towards the start and theyll be ok.the fat,memory loss chick falls into the catagory of the obnoxious tag along character that is tragicly overpresent in todays childrens movies.finding nemo 2 would be an outstanding idea,but they should really not have him get lost again like that home alone kid.perhaps helping nemo or exploring with nemo?
B00007ELEL|5.0|After the darkly surreal, snow swept landscapes of the Minnesota, depicted in Fargo, the Coen brothers wisely opted for a different locale and tone with bright, comedic vibe of The Big Lebowski. The film was just too odd for mainstream audiences and promptly tanked at the box office. However, it found new life on video and has since become a cult film favourite, inspiring countless websites and even an annual convention known as the Lebowski Fest that has been running for three years!<br /><br />The Coens are not known for providing many extras with the video releases of their films so it is a pleasant surprise to see a couple included with this fine disc.<br /><br />First off, there is a nice teaser trailer that is presented in its original theatrical format and features an excellent montage of the important characters from the film complete with the Kenny Rogers and the First Edition song, \\"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\\" that plays during the \\"Gutterballs\\" dream sequence.<br /><br />The disc also includes an entertaining 30 minute promotional video entitled, \\"The Making of The Big Lebowski.\\" While not nearly as informative or exhaustive as the book of the same name that was released in conjunction with the film, this promo is worth watching if only to see Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and, in particular, the interview-shy Coens talk about their film.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the standard cast and filmmaker biographies/filmographies which features nothing that you couldn't get from a press kit or the official website. Pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />I daresay that The Big Lebowski is the Coen brothers' best film to date. It is the perfect mix of their flashy style, eccentric characters, and distinctive dialogue. It is a rare comedy that can be watched over and over and never get old. The richly detailed world that is so inviting and entertaining that you want to revisit it again and again. The Dude abides.
B00003CXXI|1.0|there is this ogre whose crabby throughout the entire movie.a really obnoxious donkey,a nagging princess.yep you guessed it!a movie full of crappy characters.they used nickelodeons formula of gross out to carry it along.DISNEY SUCKS!10 years from now when everyone realizes it too.remember,i said it 1st right here on amazon.a cranky ogre and a jackass go to save a princess.thats it.the kids eat it up for some reason,but still prefer a lot of other far better childrens movies.its very low on the pixar food chain.there is fart,poop,and puke jokes all the way through.even the suprise ending is far less than stellar.every character in this one sucks.they have personalities not compatible with other lifeforms.mike myers did the voice?well,theres one more failure for his long list.they made a 2nd one with the money they made off all the suckers who saw the 1st one.it probaly sucks too.
B0000009SY|5.0|I've enjoyed listening to the CD Joes Garage many times.  I've got to admit, I had to listen to it a couple of times to completely understand what the CD was about.  The CD is about how the government is starting to censor music.  The CD is set up to play out like a high school play, but in no way is it suitable for any setting like that. It follows a boy named Joe.  When Joe falls into a bad crowd, the central scrutinizer (Frank Zappa, narrator) blames it on music.  He says that because of music, Joe is in trouble.  Joe continues to fall deeper and deeper into trouble.   <br /> The guitar solos on this CD are great; they are long and very interesting.  The song I like the best is the song \\"Joes Garage\\" because it is catchy and upbeat.  Other songs are \\"Catholic Girls\\", \\"Little Green Rosette\\" and many more.  Although Frank Zappa is technically a one hit wonder, he does a great performance on \\"Joes Garage\\". \\"Joes Garage\\" is not suitable for the young and easily offended and you may want to seek professional help after you listen to it.  Frank Zappa just gives you a very different perspective on things, instead of a free world, music is censored like in Iran or other places in the middle east.  All in all, if you are a Frank Zappa Fan, this is a great CD to listen too.
B00005KARJ|3.0|this movie is quite old.i hear its been getting a bad rep lately because its a disney film with a lot of african americans doing all the manual labor.i think back then you could still call them black without a gang shooting on your hands.so what?they worked.would you really sacrifice history for the appeasel of one group?should i even have to say all this?nobody has cared for 60 years .why start now.its a kids movie for petes sake.let it go.dumbo is a elephant who is born with very big ears.all the other ignorant peers of his torment him reguraly and make life for him generaly unbearable.i think the kids will like it .i think the point needs to be stressed that the tormenters are bad.this movie is so old,i think colonel sanders was still a private then.its better than a lot of disney movies but worse than a lot too hence its average rating.this was also back before grossing out the movie goers was a regular part of movie going.i think thats good.i certainly dont like looking at poop,hearing farts,watching puke etc.the movie is more or less wholesome and i applaud it.some kids who are the tormentors probably wont like it.other kids only will watch movies that have animation thats up to todays standards.thats sad as there are a lot of old movies that are cool.the constant harrasment dumbo suffers may get to an over-sensitive child but most kids are able to deal with it.the message is that you shouldnt pick on people just because they are different than you.

B000002JKA|4.0|In what is called \\"progressive rock\\" IMO King Crimson is at the top of the mountain. I have Pink Floyd a close 2. And then there is Dream Theatre. These guys are ridiculous. They maybe the most proficient, technical musicians I have ever heard. Absolutely 75 minutes of musical paradise. There proficiency does not take away the soul of this music,the combination of the two is the beauty of it. John Pertrucci is just \\"sick.\\" The guy isn't human. Mike Portnoy is jaw-dropping, the best drummer I've heard since Bill Bruford,John Bonham and Billy Cobham. And John Myung maintains the bottom for these two lunatics as well as anybody could except maybe Tony Levin or Trey Gunn. Then we have the singer James Labrie(is that his name)while there are a few vocal parts that come across good,IMO his vocals are shrieky and sound almost enfeminate. A raspy,almost gruff,more masculine sounding voice would fit the tone of the music affectively. If this would be strictly an instrumental album it would be off the charts,man Peace.
B00003CXCT|5.0|it can't reach the greatness that Battlefield Earth attained, but it's not bad
B00005JNEI|1.0|If there was a way to give less than one star, I would.  The information given within this film is very onesided and biased.  It is also just a little piece of the whole story.  If you believe everything you see in the news, in print and in movies, such as this one, you are very poorly informed.  If you are really interested, look into things more deeply and find the pieces of information that are true while throwing the rest out.  Most of this film could just be thrown out.  I see the things that have happened, and are happing, over here on a daily basis for the past 3 years and things are just not as the media and Michael Moore show.  In the end it is all about making money and controversy is one of the easiest ways to do this.  In this point, Michael Moore did a great job, he made a lot of money using complete fallacy and personal bias.
B000003TAR|5.0|As I'm sure a lot of you have seen already, there have been some mind-numbingly incorrect statements being made about Nirvana and their album 'In Utero', as well as a few other bands such as Alice in Chains, by certain members of this site. Members such as Spidermonkey, Slave to the Power of Prog Metal, Cure My Ills, EveryoneZen and PARTICULARLY Mastershake. Let me just take some time to address some of the ill-informed opinions of some of these misguided people.    Spidermonkey:   You're major problem with this album seems to be its lyrical content. Quote: \\"Teenage angst has paid off well...Oh the irony of the opening line of the album. I'm sure it did pay them well... in bucket loads of cash.\\" First off, did you even listen to the line IMMEDIATELY following that one? Incase not, Kurt says \\"Now I'm bored and old.\\" Kurt is commenting on the futility of being angry at everything and everyone all the time and how it gets you nowhere. Look at the poor mans life, CHRIST...it's a testament to that thought. Do you think he wanted to be rich and famous? He had debilitating stomach ulcers that left him puking up blood before concerts due to the stress of touring and his new-found popularity, he hated the media and avoided interviews whenever he could, shrugged off ANY suggestion that he was the \\"Voice of a Generation\\" and drove a 1300 dollar Volkswagen. You also stated that 'Heart-Shaped Box' and 'All Apologies' where...whiny? I will agree that, yes they did come from a different emotional state then some of the other tracks on the album, but to call them whiny is really just ignorant. Listen not to what Kurt is saying with his words but what the overall musical arrangements are trying to tell you. Listen to the way the guitars intermix with the vocals and drums to create a mood of agitation in some parts to mourning and sorrow in other parts. What Kurt could not express fully in his lyrics, he expressed perfectly with his guitar textures. And yes, we all know that Kurt wasnot the best guitarist in the world but what he lacked in ability and \\"b*tching licks\\", he made up for in raw passion and conviction. To me, that is more impressive then how many time signature shifts and fret board wanking you can pull off in a single measure of music anyway. Also, you made light that this album was `less-tolerable' then `Nevermind'. Listen man, this album WAS SUPPOSED TO BE less tolerable then their breakthrough album. `In Utero' was a conscious effort to separate the posers they picked up when early 90's alternative hit the main stream from their REAL audience. They meant it to be a bleaker, more introspective picture of the world and they wanted it to alienate people. So if you're looking for mindless/easy pop music, look to Hilary Duff or Avril please.     EveryoneZen:  You said something to the effect that this album was too polished compared to Nirvana's earlier work. Compared to Nirvana's earlier work, the one track basement tapes I made in 2000 with my old band sound like the work of Brian Eno or Kevin Shields. `Bleach' was made for only $600 because that's all that the band had at the time! Kurt even said that he was less then happy with the way `Bleach' turned out in the end. When they were signed to DGC, for `Nevermind', producer Butch Vig and mixer Andy Wallace were part in parcel with the contract. The result, though a timeless magnum opus was not what the band, in particular Kurt, had envisioned. So for `In Utero', don't you think that it's acceptable that, now that they had the money and the means, they would now make the record they always wanted to make? I mean, they didn't spend it on anything else. And who better then New York Noise scene musician/producer Steve Albini to do the job? Out of any of the producers available at the time, I totally believe that he was, HANDS DOWN, the best man for the job. Yeah, it definitely sounded cleaner than `Bleach' but that's what happens when underground bands hit the mainstream. It doesn't take away from cred, it's just the way the system works sometimes. Who cares if they pumped a lot of money into its production? The result was amazing and yes, it is a difficult listen, but a very rewarding one if you stick with it.    Slave to the Power of Prog Metal:   Ok, like I said before, Kurt Cobain was not the greatest guitarist in the world. So what? Comparing Nirvana to Soundgarden is like comparing apples to oranges. Each band, like each of the big four of early 90's Grunge, has a completely different aesthetic and played for different audiences; they all just got heaped into the buzz-word/lifestyle of \\"Grunge\\" to make it easier for record execs and fashion designers to exploit them. Nirvana was a band more concerned with the punk technique for writing songs whereas Soundgarden took the more technical metal approach to theirs. Now, I LOVE Soundgarden and Mr. Cornell, but you can't honestly say one was better then the other...it's unfair. Oh, and by the way, PLEASE leave those clichéd puns to Chad Kroeger.     Cure My Ills:  Now, I understand that a lot of people don't agree with a lot of the things that Kurt did in his life and that a few aspects of it were deplorable (and I think that we're not getting the whole story behind his tragic death, but that is a discussion for another time). Therefore I do realize why you wouldn't want a young child to follow his example. However, if you're child worships Cobain THAT much, then something isn't right here. I loved, LOVED this band when I was younger. They were all I listened to day and night, and opened me to so much beautiful and challenging music as I grew up, but I had total respect and admiration for my parents. They were my role models, not Kurt and how he decided to live his life. If that isn't the case with you, then your qualms lay elsewhere, not with the subject matter of this album. Also, keep in mind that this is a music review page and we're here to discuss that music, not the lifestyle of the artists who made it.    Mastershake:   My God...where do I begin? I have taken it upon myself to read all of your reviews and NEVER have I seen anyone so misinformed as yourself. The only thing I can think of that explains your reviews are that A: you have NO idea what's going on, NO concept of the passage of time and have been living under a rock for the last 14 years or B: you're joking around. I sincerely hope its B. If not, I have some writing to do...    1) Its spelled Kurt Cobain, not Kirk Conbay or Kirk Konami. This statement in itself is the biggest evidence I have that you're just a**ing around and that all of what I'm going to say in pointless...but never the less...    2) Nirvana formed nearly a decade before Puddle of Mudd. They were jamming in the Seattle area before Wes Scantlin even picked up his first guitar. Wes has also been quoted as saying that \\"Nirvana and Alice in Chains were some of (his) biggest influences growing up\\". So, how can bands that came and concluded before his musical career began, be the ones ripping him off? This is like saying the Beatles ripped off Oasis.    3) Pearl Jam was formed from the ashes of a band called Mother Love Bone who were the remnants of a band called Green River. Green River along with Soundgarden, Malfunkshun (whose singer, Andy Wood, would join with members of Green River to form Mother Love Bone), The Melvins, Skin Yard and The U-Men would appear on a compilation released by Sub-Pop called `Deep Six'. This compilation would lay the groundwork for the genre we now know as \\"Grunge\\". Like my previous statement however, Pearl Jam was formed nearly a decade before Staind came into being so once again, you're chronology is incomprehensibly wrong. Staind also have a song on their last album `14 Shades of Grey' called \\"Layne\\". As you probably don't know, that song was written about Layne Staley. The lead singer of Alice in Chains who died in mid 2002. Aaron Lewis, like Wes Scantlin, considers Alice in Chains, a MAJOR influence on his bands sound and has total respect and admiration for Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam.    4) This one kills me. Fred Durst IS NOT an 80's thrash metal pioneer. Fred Durst is a washed-up tattoo artist who road the coattails of Korn and the late 90's Nu-Metal flash in the pan to stardom. If you want REAL thrash metal pioneers, listen to Metallica or Slayer.    5) AVRIL LAVIGNE IS NOT PUNK.     6) HILARY DUFF DOES NOT SCREAM NOR IS SHE HEAVY.    7) Godsmack got their name FROM Alice in Chains not vic versa. Originally, Godsmack was an Alice cover band and it wasn't until 1995, after AIC stopped touring, that Sully Erna decided to write original material with his band.    8) `Nevermind' outsold `In Utero' and though the latter was praised by critics, `Nevermind' (along with `Ten' from Pearl Jam) are considered modern rock masterpieces. Call it a hunch...but I doubt Godsmack, Puddle of Mudd or maybe even Staind will ever have that distinction under their belts.    9) `In Utero' was not Nirvana's debut album, it was their last. `Bleach' was their debut on a minor (Sub-Pop) and `Nevermind' was their debut on a major (DGC). `Nevermind' was never banned in the United States.    10) Lacuna Coil came before Evanescance.    11) Linkin Park has no Thrash elements to their sound.    That all being said, and pending that your not kidding around...though I don't see how you couldn't be, PLEASE for your sake and everyone else's, go to [...] and read their critics reviews of some of the albums/artists you have slagged on here. All I can say aside from that is, and this goes for everyone, keep listening to as much music as you can, regardless of style or content. There are two many three-chord wonders writing songs about how their childhood was bad and how their girlfriend left them for another guy and making money off it. That is why the music industry is in the sad state of affairs that it's in today. Not enough people challenging themselves to listen or write truly original timeless music. I'm not saying we need ANOTHER Nirvana...we have too many of those already, I'm just saying we need visionaries of like-minds, not of like-sounds.    Also, being a fan of music, doesn't just mean owning all of bands albums, it means reading up on their bios, history and anything else you can get your hands on all the while being media literate and keeping an open mind.    One final note on this album though. This may be presumptuous, but anyone who doesn't give this album and albums like it, at least 4 stars...isn't listening hard enough. This was the swan-song of a truly gifted songwriter and arguably our generations John Lennon. Don't let this turn into a forgotten masterwork...keep it alive, keep listening.
B00003CXI0|3.0|first id just like to say that there are many fine movies about witches that people have loved for years like mary poppins and wizard of oz.i swear!the church would complain about god if they could.i think the movie is a bit slow in places.other than that its quite good.this is a childrens movie and if you have a kid with a good attention span than this is a good movie for them.as far as types go,id say fantasy.there are 3 parts.i like the 2nd one a tiny touch better.ive yet to see the 3rd .anyone who thinks witchcraft and satanism are the same will not like this.owever,they are not.witches dont belive in god or satan.only someone who belives in satan can be a satanists.so,the only one who could be are the church.it is very emotional in places as the chuldren are put into grave danger.i havent read the book but i hear its a classic.however,in classic books' defense id like to say the term classic in reference to books is used pretty freely.the hype is nearly always way worse or way better than the actual movie.this one is about average leaning towards good.oops!did i forget the plot?3 kids go to witchcraft school and eventualy venture into a secret room    full of magic and secrets.the message here is,if you want a movie to criticize,this isnt it.how about all these chick flicks that encourage women to wear as little as possible,lie to men,cheat on them with thier best friend,run off with thier kids etc.harry potters not the bad guy.the most intense part is when the 3 kids are in the secret room and are forced into a game of wizards chess.this is where the game is played with real life characters and when slain its for real.ifr theres any part that may be too much for the kids,this is it.one more minor note,the architecture is exquisite!
B0000033IS|5.0|So much has been written about this album that it's really tough to add anything new. And the term \\"classic\\" is thrown around so much these days that it's hard to put it into any useful perspective. But the bottom line is this: any serious fan of music should have a copy of this; it trascends all labels, all boundaries. It is a must have. And there is a reason Rolling Stone Magazine gives this 5 stars and calls this \\"the Best Soul Album Ever Recorded\\" ( it says so right on the cd package.) From the instantly recognizable sass and strut of \\"Respect\\", to the blues belter \\"Dr Feelgood\\", through the Bossa Nova-flavoured  \\"Don't Let Me Lose This Dream\\", every song is a winner.  Miss Franklin even had a hand in writing several  of the tracks on this album, showing she is much more than just \\"the world's greatest soul singer.\\" There are more classic songs on this album than you can shake a stick at. Just read the tracklisting and see for yourself. Franklin is backed by the Muscle Shoals house band on this album, although only one song ( the incredible title track ) was recorded entirely in the famous Alabama studio, and they really deliver the goods. As good as some of her mostly overlooked Columbia Records material was ( and a lot of it was very good, although it was more \\"adult\\" in that it was more jazz oriented ) her Atlantic debut has a passion -  grit and soul- that had never before been captured on tape. And Franklin has a gift of interpretation ( only hinted at during her 5 years with Columbia Records, where she mostly sang big band, jazz, blues, soul and pop covers, as well as a small handfull of self-penned originals ) that is unequaled in the world of popular music. Her covers of  Otis Redding's \\"Respect, of \\"Drown In My Own Tears\\" ( previously recorded by both Dinah Washington and by Ray Charles ) and of Sam Cooke's beautiful ballad \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" make you forget the orginals. The Reign Begins Here.
B0002QXAD6|5.0|1. Dark Chest Of Wonders: A good heavy start this also shows how good Emppu is as a guiter player. 10/10 <br />     <br />2.

Planet Hell: This does not open with Nightwish first. Which is a change but when you hear it it will blow you away. 9'10 <br />       <br />5. Creek Mary's Blood: A very good song the way it is put together sounds like it is from a movie. 10/10 <br />       <br />6. Siren: There bass player sings here more then Tarja. Again very different for this band. 10/10       <br /> <br />7. Dead Gardens: This is the start of two heavy songs. If you don't like songs where the guiter and drums are in your face then pass over this one. 10/10 <br />       <br />8. Romanticide: Again like the last song if you don't like in your face guiter playing and drumers then pass over it. 10/10       <br />9. Ghost Love Score: Again like song number 5 this sounds like it can be in a movie. 10/10 <br />       <br />10. Kuolema Tekee Taitcilijan: Very good song. The rest of Nightwish is not here it is just Tarja. 9/10 <br />       <br />11. Higher Than Hope: A great end to the album 10/10 <br />       <br />12. White Night Fantasy: Well this is not on the CD I got it is on one of the three singles. This is not very Nightwish. It is different and not every one will like it. 6/10
B0001BPREM|3.0|This movie is a Julia Roberts vehicle.  It tries to be a feminist version of Dead Poet's Society and fails miserably.  Julia Stiles performance is terribly affected.  All the other characters are played to type and not allowed to flesh out as real people except for Julia Roberts who essentially plays herself.  The music for the film is interesting.  Watch for the party scene where an white actor lip-synches Seal's version of \\"Mona Lisa\\",(would it have been too shocking to have a person of color in this film?).  Overall, this movie is barely interesting.  If you're not a Julia Roberts fan, skip it.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|My all-time favorite zombie movie has finally arrived in a 4-disc set. I have been waiting for this edition for a long time and now I finally have it. After I had heard a few years back that Anchor Bay was making plans for this release, I continued to torture myself with my old VHS copy until this was in my hands. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely!!! Every zombie fan should have this in their collection if they don't already.    To those who trashed this classic...were you watching the same movie? If it were not for DOTD or NOTLD many of your zombie faves may not have existed. Zombie 2 is a good example. Even Roger Ebert called it one of the BEST horror movies ever made and he is usually pretty rough on horror.    So if you love zombies, gore galore, social satire, tons of action, and characters you can actually care about then DAWN is for you. Besides, who hasn't dreamed about taking over a mall? I will take the electronics store and arcade room thank you.

B0002S94OS|4.0|This album is good. It's production is cleaner and the vocals are easier to understand. The riffs are good and very Lamb of God sounding. There's even more soloing and you can hear it better. This is all nice and good but this album just isn't as heavy as As The Palaces Burn and New American Gospel. It's not just due to production either, the guitar tone is alittle different too and Randy doesnt sound like hes singing about something he's passionate about. It doesn't sound as evil as it should. It doesn't have that raw dirty sound found on the old album. Buit its still good
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone.To me, I saw the main character in this film as being a kind of 80's version of Holden Caulfield(The Catcher in The Rye).The soundtrack is disturbing which adds depth and beauty to a wonderfully shot film.I guess some might find this movie a tad boring with the lack of action heroes and no instant gratification with the ending .Sometimes it hurts your head to think!   BURN IT TO THE GROUND!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has a history of filming the truth, just as the ultra-conservative Republicans of this nation have a history of lies.  Instead of pointing fingers at Michael Moore, past presidents, or John Kerry, I challenge anyone to counter the basic tenets of Mr. Moore's film.  Can't do it?  Perhaps, just perhaps, it's the truth.  STOP burying your head in the sand -- get this slimy administration OUT!  GREAT FILM!!
B0002I831S|5.0|This set is remarkable, largely because you get to see Shatner before the fall. A few of the episodes aren't worth the disks they're printed on, especially \\"the enemy within,\\" where Shatner walks through his lines like the dazed Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds singer he would become. Still it's well worth the pain.

B00004NHCC|5.0|This is another album ranking in my top-ten personal favorites, and damned if it doesn't feature Clifford Brown too, just like Helen Merrill's classic...he draws your heartstrings and accents these recordings naturally, perfectly. Beautiful songs, beautiful lady, nobody has more gorgeous phrasing or heart-lifting vocals than Sarah.  Can you live without this album in regular rotation?  I can't.
068987474X|5.0|I picked this book up, thinking about giving it two friends in problem relationships, but ended up reading it myself (happily married).  It's written with loads of humor and compassion and begs the question \\"Why aren't girlfriends able to be more honest with each other?\\"  Check out the sections at the end of each chapter for a good laugh.  After reading this, you may realize that you are \\"just not that into\\" him!
1565123875|5.0|Purple Hibiscus is a vivid, beautifully written novel about a 14 year-old girl named Kambili growing up in a stifling Catholic household in Nigeria.  The story pairs the collapse of the family's strong patriarch who frequently physically abuses his family alongside with the deterioration of the Nigerian society's infrastructure as it undergoes a military coup. Kambili is a very sheltered child who is incredibly insecure because of the repressive regimen her father forces her to follow. Yet, she is looked down upon by her peers and initially scorned by her outspoken cousin because she is viewed as a privileged snob.  When she visits her aunt and cousins she learns how to assert herself and become a more independent individual.<br /><br />Adichie presents you with a portrait of domestic violence very much from the inside. We see the father through Kambili's eyes as a pillar of the community and someone she genuinely loves. Therefore the abuse he administers is seen only as a gesture of love for her own good. It's only when Kambili is pulled out of this horrific environment that she is able to see how wrong it is and understand that this abuse is not normal. While this novel really involves you in the struggles of its characters, it also shows you a lot about the complex political and religious struggles occurring in Nigeria. It's one of those wonderful stories that can broaden your perspective while being incredibly emotionally engaging. This is an amazing first novel from such a young writer and I hope she will continue to write many more books with as much heart and soul as Purple Hibiscus.
0316096199|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the Lovely Bones, but Lucky was quite the opposite. I dove right into the pages. Sebold's writing style is magnificent and enchanting. The words jumped out at me, and it's a wonderful retelling of how she was able to rise above. <br /> <br />The book starts out with the brutal and honest account of her rape, which occured in her freshman year of college. It follows all the way through the rest of her college years. <br /> <br />The story was riviting and I reccomend it to everyone.
0060930187|5.0|In the autobiographical novel of a young girl struggling with her place in life, I have learned about the society of the 1950's and the workings of a brilliant mind gone awry in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar.  This young girl is Ester Greenwood, a teenager enrolled in the honors program in her college, and who seems to be having everything go her way.  Her high school love, Buddy Willard, proposed to her, and she was also sent on a scholarship to see the glamour and glitz of NYC for a month.  All this may seem like a dream come true, but Ester finds herself in a nightmare.  Her friends don't seem to matter to her, she is repulsed by fiance-to-be, and her dream of becoming a professor/poet isn't as enticing as it once was.  Ester keeps sinking down deeper into a slump and becomes more detached from the world.  When she comes home for the summer, her condition worsens, she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills, and shortly finds herself in a mental hospital.  Her recovery is steady, and eventually is released before her next college term, but she learns important lessons about herself and her world in the mean time. <br /> These lessons involve the complicated society of the 1950's, where women are happy being wives and homemakers, and willingly submit to their husbands.  Ester's mental instability was not portrayed as dark and disturbed, but merely confused.  Ester found herself \\"sitting in the crotch of a fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant loosing all the rest, and as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\" (63)  One fig was a husband, another a successful career, and still another a ticket around the world.  Ester's indecision 50 years ago made me realize how people have stayed the same, and showed how realistically she was characterized.  The story of Ester was a coming of age novel where she began to mature and see how her life would unfold.  Her case was not resolved perfectly, since with every life story, there are always doubts and mistakes.  The nonperfect ending was part of what made me like the book so much. <br /> The Bell Jar was a perfect selection for me, being a young girl in a changing society.  It showed me how much people are influenced by their relationships and surroundings, but not in a moralizing way.  The book was witty and surprisingly humorous considering its subject, honest and bold. What I also enjoyed about the book was the ties that were present to the real life of Sylvia Plath, who had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt as well.  The similarities to a true story made the setting and characters very real, since some characters were loosely based on people in the author's life.  The plot isn't particularly suspenseful or fast-moving, but I was very drawn into it, and I recommend others to read this clever and interesting account of a young girl's undoing and recovery.

B0001XAPX8|4.0|Instead of having premeditated impressions, the movie's casting coaxes me into seeing it. The story itself is meaningful and its overall arrangement is captivating, but more running time could have been employed to deepen the plot's moving power. <br /> <br />Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) was accused of racial discrimination because he referred to his two African American students as \\"spooks\\" since they were absent from the class. After experiencing disastrous losses at this late stage of his life, he befriended the writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) and was involved with a working-class woman Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) who was much younger than he was. Dark, tragic pasts, including the intrusions of her ex-husband (Ed Harris), kept plaguing Faunia. Thus, people around Coleman Silk had been persuading him out of romanizing with Faunia. However, their suggestions went on deaf years, for Faunia reminded Silk of his youthful love and was almost a salvation for him to purity his deep-rooted anguish. <br /> <br />The performances from the actors and actresses are all extraordinary. Hopkins, although too \\"white\\" to play Silk, was convincingly the man with simmering pain, presented by his subdued expressions. Kidman did an equally good job despite her extreme motions now and then. Moreover, the unknown young performers who play young Silk and his lover are remarkable, too, whose vividly delivery of two people confined by their ethnic biases really shine. <br /> <br />\\"The Human Stain\\" serves as a stark irony of a person not identifying with his own pedigree. The movie touches the controversial issue of racism in an innovative approach, and it is worth seeing if you are looking for a film that will arouse some afterthoughts.
0790731002|4.0|\\"Try a fireman. Less to take off.\\" - Batman uses proper fire safety against the red hot Chase Meridian in \\"Batman Forever\\"<br /><br />After \\"Warner Bros.\\" showed Michael Keaton the exit, after negotiations for a bigger salary failed, & Tim Burton's reply, to the whole debacle, was declining to direct the film and coming back only as co-producer, \\"Warner\\" had a problem on its hands. The problem was solved with Val Kilmer signing on as The Dark Knight and Joel Schumacher directing. The result is \\"Batman Forever\\", the third installment in the bat-franchise that is lighter than the first two films but careens dangerously into camp territory in certain spots of the film (I cringed when I heard the line \\"Holy rusted metal Batman!\\" or how about the implossible scene where the batmobile blasts up the side of a building to escape Two-Face & his goons. I could have done without those scenes).<br /><br />Batman goes up against, former District Attorney, Harvey Dent, who after getting acid sprayed on one side of his face, loses his mind and becomes the villainous Two-Face, deciding everyone's fate with a random toss of his scarred coin.<br /><br />Things get worse when, former Wayne Enterprises, scientist Edward Nigma develops a gadget that can transmit T.V. signals directly to the human brain, with one big side effect - the signals also imitate brain signals, from the user, that are sent back to the transmitter's original origin. Nigma absorbs these brain signals to make him smarter & an ego-maniacal danger to Gotham City.<br /><br />Batman gets some help this time around with the introduction of Robin, a former acrobat artist whose family all became victims under the wrath of Two-Face.<br /><br />\\"Batman Forever\\" probably isn't a favorite among the die-hard \\"Batman\\" fans, but, I give the movie thumbs up.<br /><br />The cast is decent. Val Kilmer does a great job as Batman (not as brooding as Keaton was). Jim Carrey is great as the Riddler, especially when destroying the Batcave (the role was originally rumored to be offered to Robin Williams, but, passed when Michael Keaton left the project).

B00003CXCT|1.0|All the 5-stars are telling those of us who grew up with these movies that we are griping and complaining over nothing. It's not \\"nothing.\\" Star Wars came out of the blue and blew us all away.  <br /> <br />At first, Han's attitude and behavior make it clear that he doesn't care who hires him - Rebel or Imperial - and that he can't be bothered with trivial details like politics. He's in it for the money alone. Imagine what \\"Fistful Of Dollars\\" would be like if someone went back and added CGI patrons to this dry, dusty deserted little town, turning it into a bustling metropolis. Imagine added scenes of Eastwood's \\"Joe\\" sitting at the bar drinking a wine cooler or something healthy, agonizing over how he's just going to \\"do the right thing\\" and how he's not in it for the money. In one moment, that's what Lucas did with Mos Eisley and Han's character. Remember what Kenobi said on the ridge overlooking Mos Eisley: \\"You will not find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.\\" Scum and villainy in the special edition looks more like Keystone Kops and Three Stooges humor. <br /> <br />Han's firing first is one of the best actions to describe a person's character that you could find. Han IS A BAD GUY. His attitude says it all: Don't bother him with any troubles or cause. Just show him the money. It is only the course of events that bring him around. The character grows and improves through the story. Believe it or not (especially in the current U.S. political climate) but seeing your mistakes and correcting them shows good moral character. <br /> <br />And let's talk about that shot from a technical standpoint. As per interviews and such that came out just before and just after Star Wars was released, including Starlog #7, Greedo's gun was never made to be fired. The guns had strobe lights in the muzzles. The actor would pull the trigger and the light would flash. This would tell the FX crew where to start when drawing the beam. Greedo's gun did not have a strobe light. Lucas NEVER intended for that gun to be fired. And let's look at the position: Greedo's hand was solidly braced, resting on the table with the muzzle pointed at Solo's breastbone, at a range of less than three feet. Had Greedo closed his eyes first and an earthquake hit Mos Eisley at that moment, he still could not have missed. The beam emerged (without the tell-tale flash of every other blaster) and went up and to the right at an angle different from the orientation of the gun - and it's a major difference, something like 30 or 40 degrees. It clearly didn't come from that gun. <br /> <br />Solo's conversation with Jabba was completely redundant. Every topic had already been covered with Greedo. According to an interview with Lucas in Starlog #7, he shot both scenes, hated the performance of the actor that played Jabba and realized that both conversations were almost exactly the same, and decided to cut out the scene with Jabba. Despite any Orwellian statements to the contrary, Lucas himself never intended for anyone to see the Jabba scene. He never intended for Jabba to be a giant animated slug. If he had, he wouldn't have spent budget on costuming a guy no one would actually see, and the camera would have been planted and immoveable instead of following Han around the bay. (FX techniques at the time weren't sophisticated enough to handle animation and camera movement at the same time. That's why battle scenes in Empire EITHER zoom along with snow speeders OR show walkers walking - NOT BOTH. Empire was made years after Star Wars - and they still couldn't do it.) <br /> <br />The added CGI stuff in Bespin is pretty, but distracting. The same goes for the skycar chase in Clones. There's so much background movement going on that the story-related action gets lost in the jumble. I'm glad Lucas had more money than God, but he should have spent it on the writing and not the pretty pictures. <br /> <br />Return (which WAS originally and officially titled \\"Revenge of the Jedi\\" - I've seen a 20th Century Fox official poster) wasn't so much part 3 as it was a combination of a 2h20m Kenner Toy commercial and \\"I changed my mind about the story in Star Wars, and I want a do-over.\\" So, in a sense, we're still waiting for part three of the original trilogy. BTW: Star Wars was NEVER originally going to be episode 4 of 9 - excuse me - 4 of 6. Originally, Lucas KNEW that it was going to flop and he hoped it would be a cult classic. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with the new trilogy - other than more time, effort, and money being spent on visuals than story; being written for 10-year-olds; and being a trilogy-long toy commercial - is that the whole thing is based on a lie. Darth Vader is NOT Luke's father. Darth Vader KILLED Luke's father. I know this. I've seen the movie and can quote the line; although, I'm sure there will be yet another special edition release when Lucas changes that and claims that the other \\"never happened.\\" <br /> <br />Here's how that section of Return should have played out (IMHO): Luke returns to Dagobah and confronts Yoda and the ghost of Ben. They explain to him that while he could feel the Force, he still couldn't control it. Vader used that to plant the idea in his mind, planted so deep that now Luke firmly believes that Vader is his father, even though it's not true. At the end, we see that the light side of the Force is indeed stronger than even the strongest of the dark side when Luke resists the taunts, regains his calm even under torture and defeats Vader and the emperor. <br /> <br />The new trilogy should have gone into the friendship between Anakin and Obi-wan, the introduction of a new young Jedi named Darth Vader (\\"Darth\\" being his name, not his title), the turning of Darth, the Clone Wars, and finally, Darth betraying the Jedi Order, killing Anakin, and helping to bring the emperor to power. <br /> <br />And I'm sorry, but the line about something being true only from a certain point of view didn't workin Return. It didn't work when Clinton used it in front of the Grand Jury. And it still doesn't work in the new trilogy. Every time a character says it, it reminds us how Lucas just threw away the story when he decided to make Return. <br /> <br />I'll buy the original theatrical releases on DVD, but not this. This isn't the real deal -- and that's NOT just my point of view.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Well, I may be a member of the \\"Old Generation,\\" as Mr. Rehnquist says, and I may also be a complainer regarding all of the changes Mr. Lucas has made to the original trilogy, but that won't stop me from buying this dvd set. I own the original trilogy on VHS as well as the \\"new and improved\\" trilogy, also on VHS. I'll buy this one too - and I'll enjoy it! I suppose my only request, however irrational, is that the original trilogy also be released (eventually) on dvd. Guess what?!? I'll buy that, too! I'm not a sucker for Star Wars stuff, just a fan (no flames, please).
0312979479|1.0|I think that this book is very stupid. It has no story to it and I think it is boring. Bizarre things happen in the little bit of plot that there is. Take my advice on this one...DONT READ IT! Only read it if you have too much time on your hands and want to be bored.
B000294SFW|4.0|What's good about it?<br /><br />You know what you're getting when Motorhead releases a new disc; Heavy f**kin' metal!  Bludgeoning driving riffs, bass lines, and drums overpower \\"Terminal Show\\".  Don't look for meaning on this one; I think Lemmy just looked for words that rhymed.  There are more heavy pounding rhythms on \\"Killers\\" and \\"Smiling Like a Killer\\".  The former is about killers in the King's army, and the latter being about a psychopath.  Motorhead open up \\"In the Name of Tragedy\\" with a riff similar to something their arch enemies W.A.S.P. would use (how appropriate; W.A.S.P. & tragedy) That's where the similarities stop!  I can imagine this one as radio single.<br /><br />\\"Suicide\\" is loaded with meaty riffs and a layered chorus that is as close to harmonized that Motorhead is going to get.  \\"Life's a Bitch\\" is charged by a bluesy repetitive lick, while a rapid-fire chugga-chugga riff sustains \\"Down on Me\\".  The frantically paced \\"Fight\\" doesn't have a lot of words, but the words Lemmy does use; he uses them a lot.  The closing track \\"Whorehouse Blues\\" is a full on blues number; acoustic chord progression, harmonica, and distant, echoey vocals.<br /><br />Anything bad?<br /><br />Where's WWE's \\"Evolution Theme\\"?<br /><br />Bottom Line<br /><br />Let's face it, Lemmy IS God!  You know that when Motorhead releases a new album you're getting the same thing that you got on the last one, but who cares?!  You're getting a true heavy metal album no matter what!  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|This CD has the general feel and sound of a movie soundtrack. I did not find it possessed the quality of sound and music selections that I have come to expect and trust with Ray Charles' name on it.
B0002S94OS|5.0|\\"Brutalitarianism\\" is a new term I've coined for Lamb of God. Randy Blithe is one of my favorite frontmen. He has the attitude, stage presence, and the voice of a demon.     \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" was a great CD, but I felt the production was flat. \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" in contrast sounds great, although I feel the tone of the guitars sounded more unique on \\"ATPB.\\" Randy's voice has never sounded better, and the songs are very well written, with pace changes, chugging rhythms, and crushing breakdowns. Not much has changed since \\"ATPB,\\" their sound has just become cleaner and more refined. A great third effort. Buy it, see them live, GET IN THE PIT.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a truly innovative album, from the aptly named \\"Let Down\\" track which is left blank, to the sterilized reading of a computer voice in \\"Fitter Happier\\" this is a brilliant album which can seem to morph itself to be new everytime it spins, A MUST HAVE! if you purchase this album its money well spent!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Bands like Atreyu and Bleeding Through claiming to be \\"metalcore\\" but giving me nothing but \\"fashin-core\\" were starting to really get on my nerves. This album restored my faith in the direction of the genre. Unearth have no fashion gimmicks or rock radio friendly sing-a-longs. Instead they have concocted one of the best blends of metal and harcore I've ever heard. They utilize the Gothenburg style of melodic riffing but don't overuse it. The riffs are technical yet crushing and the vocals are perfect, but the real killer is the BREAKDOWN. Unearth are the masters of the breakdown. I have never heard more creative and mosh-inducing breakdowns in my life. Anyone who is a fan of true metalcore should check this out.
B000003TAR|5.0|and I would write a lengthy review, but \\"James Morrison\\" has already said it ALL. That's the best, most concise review/opinion of Cobain, etc. I have ever read!! Impressive....I would love to talk to you sometime:)you obviously have an excellent knowledge of Nirvana and Kurt, which is rare amongst all these people who either slag off Courtney Love or dislike In Utero..how could you not like this album? This is a soul at its rawest, purest low, it is a masterpiece, whether or NOT it's your style, it is STILL A BRILLIANT ALBUM!! Anyways, listen to this album, it's the greatest.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|To be honest, this album could have been better, but it is by no means a waste. All of the songs that were chosen for this album are great. The problem for me was that some of them sound \\"pieced together\\", meaning that Ray may have taped his part in one studio and the other artists voice was added to the mix at a later time. Not all of the tracks sound that way though, and the ones that do are not terrible, but they don't seem to have the feeling of a true live \\"duet\\".    The songs that really do shine here are \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" w/ Bonnie Raitt, \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" w/ Gladys Knight, \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" w/ James Taylor and \\"Crazy Love\\" w/ Van Morrison. Overall this is a decent cd, certainly not up to par w/ his enduring solo work, but this being his last album, it serves as a fitting tribute from the artists whom he recorded it with.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, in a way who really cares if Greedo shot first. What is more important, the story or these details? The special editions do not change the plot, or the themes. Some aspects are improvements: crisper images, and fixing glitches that, for some folk who notice details, where a bit distracting (some background images bleeding through foregrounds). Kudos to those who are not detail folk and can overlook such glitches. I was happy that the glitches were fixed (even before, I was still a fan - I saw Star Wars IV two dozen times in the movie theaters). Most of what were added were minor improvements.<br /><br />However, two additions were not improvements. First, in Return of the Jedi, the sand pit monster is more active, which goes against its very slow metabolism (takes 1,000 years or so to digest something). It was expending way too much energy in the special edition. Second, when Hans Solo first meets with Jabba the Hut and he steps on Jabba's tail - I did not feel that it fit Hans' character; I wasn't impressed with the scene, with Jabba's reaction (I thought Jabba's reaction too humorous, not quite in keeping with his character), or with Hans calling Jabba \\"human\\" (in early versions of the script, Jabba was a human). But again, these are momentary gnats, and I love the overall movies too much to let such things ruin my life, or my overall enjoyment and love for the movie.
B00028HBKM|3.0|First thing -- see, Marcus: I TOLD you Jesus was not Black!  Now, where's my five dollars? <br /> <br />Second thing -- this film TOTALLY ROCKED.  I was like in Blockbuster last Friday and all the Wrestlemania tapes were out, and so I'm all bummed, and this dude Keifer that I went to high school with works there, so he's like \\"brother, you should watch 'The Passion of the Christ.'  It changed my life.\\"  Granted, Keifer hasn't exactly been right since he lost three fingers trying to make a pipe bomb when we were sophomores.  But he used to be like the local meth king; if you needed the ol' hillbilly heroin, you called Keifer.  And now he like goes to church every Sunday and doesn't cuss and is nice to his mom. <br /> <br />So I'm thinkin' whatever, right?  I just wanted to get stoned and order some wings from Dominos.  So I rent it, put it in the DVD player.  First, they're like speaking frickin' Palestinian or something.  What the #%&@?  I'm not trying to read subtitles or guess what Jesus is saying.  I thought he spoke English!  In fact, I remember one time I told my grandma they were going to start making us learn Spanish in school, and she said \\"if the English language was good enough for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then it's good enough for the schoolchildren of the state of Texas!\\"  So anyway, the film's in wackalackalese.  Strike one.  Plus it's all like religious, and here I'm gettin' frmnked up.  So strike two -- downer! <br /> <br />But then it's like Jesus totally starts getting the crap beat out of him!  And I'm like \\"NO.  FREAKING.  WAY.\\"  I mean, they straight off TORE JESUS UP!  And I'm all \\"Dude!  This is SO much better than Wrestlemania!\\"  The whole time I'm thinking that Jesus could be the WWF champion if he really did come back.  Wouldn't that be like the best wrestling angle EVER?  Triple H versus The Rock for the WWF championship, live in Madison Square Garden.  Thirty minutes of non-stop action.  Finally The Rock lays Trips out with a vicious chairshot.  Then he cocks The People's Eyebrow and bounces off the ropes to deliver The People's Elbow.  Then, out of nowhere, Jesus comes to the ring and totally wastes The Rock with a 2x4!  Then Hunter gets up and Jesus like turns him into a pile of crap or a giant bug!  Jesus pins The Rock, kicks Triple H in his cockroach @$$ or whatever, and makes his Glorious Appearing.   <br /> <br />To me, that would be the coolest way for the Son of God to return.  If you're listening, Jesus, give it some thought.  And don't be scared of Mel Gibson's movie; I think he meant it as a compliment.  Of course, you've been watching people wear you around their necks for years, a billion little Jesuses nailed to a billion golden crosses.  That's got to be totally creepy to you, and I'll bet you wish people would quit it.  If some dude punched me in the face, and then for the rest of my life there were like paintings and sculptures of it everywhere, I'd be a little sore about it.  So if you can stand to be reminded of that all the time, you should be fine with this film.  Just don't tell The Rock that the whole WWF thing was my idea, okay?
B00000JCOV|5.0|SLIPKNOT IS NOT HEAVY, SPEED, ALTERNATIVE, GOTHIC, DEATH, BLACK etc etc. <br />THEY R NU METAL!!!! U GOT THAT?! NUUUUU MEEETTAAAALLL!! <br />          Next, yes i do agree that nu metal is among the worst, most comercialized genres of music out there. BUT there r major exceptions, such as KoRn, System of a Down, and above all, SlipKnoT! These bands have created an artform. They each have a unique sound that is worth listening to and r nething but nu metal (even though thats wut they r considered) and among them, the greatest is in my opinion, SlipKnoT. <br />          SlipKnoT has created a sound that has led to millions of fans all over the globe and it was for good reason. These nine Demoin Iowa freaks are VERY talented. It may not seem so but it is true.  <br />          If u think the guitarists are worthless, one rift wannabees, then u should get vol. 3 The sublimenal Verses, which is wen u c their true talent due to the solos <br />          Joey (#1) is one of the greatest drummers ive ever heard (and ive heard a LOT) u will notice his talent in this album no doubt. <br />         Now, on to my fav. member, Corey (#8) who is an AMAZING vocalist! dont listen to ppl who say he sux cuz they obveously havent heard him sing. HEY ALL U MUTHER F*CKERS!!! GET THE SPIDERMAN SOUNDTRACK AND LISTEN TO THE SONG BOTHER!!!! THEN U TELLO ME, AFTER ALL THE SCREAMIN AND GROWLIN (which i might add hes done very well) U THINK HE SUCKS AT SINGING!!!! <br />         neways, the album is terrific. This is my fav SlipKnoT album followed closely by sublimenal verses. The sound is catchy and origeonal (not to mention very well done), the lyrics are inventive and can easily get stuck in ur head, and over all, this album does not have a single bad song on it (which of course is amazing for any band) I never found myself skipping any tracks on the album, and i find myself doing that a lot w/ other albums. <br />         Over all this album is worth every cent! get it NOW if ur a fan of metal and pls dont listen to the &#34;Metalheads&#34; who wont give this band a chance cuz they r talkin out of their ass. And even if ur not a fan, borrow it from a friend and give it a spin, no harm in it after all. &#60;(^_^)&#62; <br /> <br />P.S.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have been a fan of Slipknot since I saw them play at the 99Xfest in Peoria, 5/24/04.  I had seen their self-titled release in stores but was unsure because of the masks, thinking they were just a joke band, and I always have been a fan of more serious music.  However, the passion and intensity for the music that I saw in their performance was enough to convince me to purchase that album.  I bought Iowa simply on faith that it would be great as well, and I was rewarded with another great album.  When Vol. 3 was released, once again I was compelled to purchase it.  I had bought my last CD nearly a year before when I purchased Radiohead's 'Hail to the Thief' and before that I bought Tool's 'Lateralus', so I don't often buy albums because there just aren't any bands I feel will release quality albums.  Once again, Slipknot does not dissapoint, and they actually outdo themselves.  On each of the two previous albums, there was at least one or two songs I skipped over.  However, with Vol. 3, I cannot do that, every song is good.  It is a more complete record than the prior releases.  Not only does it show a more mature band, but it shows a band who is willing to combine its older material with new material.  I don't know what everybody is talking about, but 'The Virus of Life' reminds me of 'Tattered and Torn' with its deep, churning atmosphere and 'The Blister Exists' is in the same mode as 'Disasterpiece'.  They also have guitar solos, which adds a great deal to their overall sound, and yes, Corey Taylor should show off his singing skills instead of burying it behind mindless screaming and swearing.  In my opinion, and you may call me wrong should you wish to, Slipknot is THE ONLY band worth listening to who has grown out of that mid-to-late 90's surge of heavy music begun by Korn.  Every other band who released great albums has either really sold out (Limp Bizkit, Staind), have just gotten plain boring (Korn), or have broken up (Ultraspank).  There are very few heavyacts out there to hear aside from Tool, and I have no idea when to hear from them again, but I certainly hope its soon.   In conclusion, not only should you buy this album, but stop referring to them as sell-outs, because that title is reserved for Metallica, who did not just change their style, they completely threw their old style away and still cannot seem to find it.  Slipknot may have added some new aspects to their music, but they also have stayed true to what got them to where they are, and as far as I am concerned they are the future of heavy music.  Nobody else comes close.  And don't give me all that crap about bands that nobody has heard of.  Just because music is underground or independend does not make it great, especially when the people who like it only like simply because it is underground or independent.  There is no worse excuse for liking music, and just go ahead and say any different, because your rhetoric will go unappreciated and unheard, just like mine.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park really blew my mind away with their new album.  I really loved their first album Hybrid Theory and thought that it would be a tough task for Linkin Park to top it but they sure did.  The way the CD literally crashes into the first song \\"Don't Stay\\" and just blows your mind with hard guitar riffs, great drumming, and of course the classic singing and well know \\"yelling\\" from lead singer Chester.  \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is the song that helped rocket this album to the top and it is no mystery as to why it did.  Chester's vocals and Mike's rapping give this song a mood that just brings you to love this band all over again.  The song \\"Numb\\" is what really brought about my love for this new album.  Chester's awesome vocals and the soft mood of this song just can't help but make you tingle inside.   <br />Although many compare Linkin Park to bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park still finds a way to totally remove themselves from that category by creating such an original sound from those other rock groups.  With the use of two singers (one who plays back-up guitar), a lead guitar, bass, a DJ, and an extremely talented drummer who uses a combined acoustic and electric drum set, Linkin Park creates a completely different tone from those other rock bands that they are often compared to.  On a positive note, it still amazes me how a rock band such as Linkin Park can create all these songs with their own lyrics and not use a single curse or swear during the course of the song.  Nowadays it takes real talent to be able to write a meaningful rock song without the constant swearing and cursing.  Two thumbs up to them for that.   <br />Linkin Park's newest album Meteora rocks.  They've found a way to mix rock, rap, and even the occasional piano and flute to create a sound that is so different from any other band out there today.  There music definitely speaks for itself when it comes to bringing about their mood.  They are able to get a point across without criticizing people, cursing, or swearing.  They are definitely a one of a kind. <br />
6305205620|4.0|This is an interesting show.  This is right in the thick of the \\"Load\\" tour when Metallica were trying something different. <br />So What sounds pretty damn good and it's a good way to open the show.  Right from that into Creeping Death which always sounds cool live.  Then the boys go into the worst version of Sad But True they've probably ever done.  I always skip this because it's just...eww.  Ain't My Bitch sounds good live however, as do Hero of the Day and King Nothing.  Then they go into a pretty bad version of One where Kirk misses the start of his solo and James sounds...not very good.  Then, a nice little version of Fuel w/ alternate lyrics and as always, Fuel smokes live.  Then a bass/guitar doodle of My Friend of Misery and Sanitarium into a very good version of Nothing Else Matters.  Then Until It Sleeps comes in which I'm not a fan of personally, but it sounds good live.  Then good ol' Bellz kicks in and gets the place jumpin'.  Great live song and huge crowd pleaser every time.  Then, Wherever I May Roam which is good live, but I'm glad it's not a staple anymore.  Then...Fade to Black.  A GREAT version of Fade to Black at that.  Everybody nails their parts perfectly and the mood that is set is just awesome.  Then they play the Kill/Ride medley, which consists of parts of Ride the Lightning, No Remorse, Hit the Lights, The Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy, and Fight Fire w/ Fire.  Then for the encore they come out with Last Caress into the first part of Master of Puppets, cutting out before the interlude, then segwaying into Enter Sandman.  At the end of Sandman is where the \\"stunts\\" come in.  Lots of pyro, explosions, lights cutting out, emergency workers w/ flashlights, and a guy on fire running across the stage.  Once all that's done, the PA system has actually collapsed so it looks like a little garage, which is lit by dozens of hanging light bulbs.  The last two songs for the night are Am I Evil? and a badly edited version of Motorbreath where Kirkis clearly using two different guitars.  Overall, it's all right.  Get S&M before you get this, or better yet, go see Metallica for yourself.
B00022XOAO|2.0|This recording sounds like it was taped before WWII, although it is only a decade or so old. The tempis are too fast, the playing unprecise. An eccentric approach which misses so many points. Not recommended. The Beethoven \\"Gold Standard\\" is still Karajan (1962 as well as 1977)  with the Berliners, or, if you will, Abbado with the Berliners.
078322804X|3.0|I love the VHS edition of this movie.  The problem with this edition is that some of the added scenes add nothing to the movie, or are just lame and make a great film mediocre.  It seems Mr. Landis caught \\"Lucas Fever\\" and decided to screw up the film.  For instance, John Landis states in the liner notes something to the effect of \\"I don't know why the exploding gas station scene was dropped from the original film.\\" Well, I know--the scene is senseless and stupid.  It shouldn't have put it in this version of the film.      The ending in this version is different also, showing tons of prison guards with rifles rushing into the mess hall where the now incarcerated Blues Brothers are playing Jailhouse Rock. This turns the original hopeful, somewhat happy ending into an ominous downer.  It is nice that he extends the musical scenes, but do we really need the scene where Elwood quits his day job? No, not at all.    I returned the Collector's Edition and got my money back.  I never want to hear a director complain about having his creative freedom curtailed by a producer or \\"suit\\".  It seems that most directors, when left to their own devices, take a good thing and screw it up.    Postscript:  A while after I wrote this review, they put out an anniversary edition DVD that contains both the theatrical cut and the director's cut---buy that one.
6305949980|5.0|This is an incredible film. The animation is brilliant, and the story is unique and well told. A perfect film with one of the best soundtracks ever made.
0321213351|5.0|If you're thinking about this book, and you probably wouldn't be reading this if you weren't, you may just be puzzled by the title, or you may be wondering just what it's all about. No, it has nothing to do with cloth or wall paper. It's about software programming. Perhaps someone told you about this book and you're wondering what it is all about.  <br /> <br />Refactoring, simply put is re-writing code to make it simpler, easier to understand without changing what the code does.  <br /> <br />Patterns are simply common solutions to recurring problems faced by programmers.  <br /> <br />This book is not intended to be your first programming book. But if you are working as a professional programmer, this book can help you write better, tighter, faster, easier to modify code. The title is the most imposing, even frightening part of the book. Inside it is clearly written and provides a lot of hints, tips and suggestions that are worth quite a lot.
B00006SKRX|5.0|This first outing by the founder of Pink Floyd is nothing short of a quiet masterpiece. The album works on many levels. Musically is very strong with Clapton leaving his mark. The lyrics by Roger Waters are poetic and written at the height of his writing powers. The fact that he wrote this at the same time as 'The Wall' may have something to do with it. Also, go to ROGER-WATERS.COM (Written in Sept. 2004) and hear two new songs by Roger Waters for FREE. These songs are written after a decade of silence.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I viewed Fahrenheit 9/11 just to see what all the fuss is about.  I went to the theater with an open mind, but left the theater with a thorough disgust for Michael Moore's blatant disregard for journalistic integrity.  I went to the theater to see a movie made by a professional, but instead saw a movie made by an amateur.  Take a few truths and make them lies, take a few lies and make them truths, and apparently, you have a Michael Moore film.  Seriously, if you decide to watch this movie, I ardently recommend that you also read the bi-partisan 9/11 Commission Report (ISBN 0393326713.)  Let's face it, Mr. Moore, George Bush isn't responsible for 9/11 -- al-Qaeda is.  Perhaps you've heard of Osama bin Laden?  Additionally, Mr. Moore, the 9/11 Commission Report is just as critical of Bill Clinton as it is of George Bush.  Why didn't you give Clinton the same level of vitriol as you did Bush in your movie?  Mr. Moore, you make the First Amendment sound like a bad idea.  <br />
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Unlike some critics and moviegoers, I liked Daredevil a lot when it hit theatres, as much for it's straightforward storytelling as for it's colorful characters. And, despite the backlash Ben Affleck endured because of his romance with JLo, he was terrific in the role. In fact, this film worked so well because of the care for the characters and material from everyone involved in the movie. Yet, while watching Daredevil in the theatre and later on DVD, it was more and more obvious that there had been a lot of rampant editing going on for the sake of trimming the film down, which ultimately gave the storyline a choppy, almost throwaway quality that, you could feel by watching, had not been the director's original intention. Luckily, the version that we all suspected was out there somewhere will finally become available soon. Thanks!
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|The upbeat anticipation I experienced prior to hearing this album was sharply contrasted with the reality of the production.  Although I resisted the feeling, it was nevertheless a tired and frail Ray who was occasionally spliced into the songs of various other artists and their bands.  A few of the tunes were listenable, but this is not the energized, bright and beautiful Ray Charles who cut through the music scene with his own sound.   Don't buy it, I'll send you mine.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Este disco reune 27 sencillos (singles) de The Beatles, haciendo una recopilacion de temas clasicos. Para el que es fanatico/a de los Beatles es un disco mas, y no encontrara nada nuevo. Un detalle muy bueno es la diagramacion y el contenido del libro interior. Es ideal como regalo para cualquier ocasion o si busca tener en su coleccin un \\"The best of\\" (Lo mejor de) de The Beatles.
B000002H33|5.0|How can anybody knock this album . Let me say the speed, the power then they hit you with some clasical harmonies that just floor you . Every song on this CD rocks balls to the wall. Me personaly prefer instrumental. To me this album is thier best of the early stuff. Now \\"they have no disapline in thier music & no solo's just like mainstream crapp\\".
B00029LNHS|3.0|I bought this CD using someone elses money, so I was not that upset, nevertheless, if i had spent my money on it, it would have been upset.  It is O.K., for anyone who just wants to own it buy it used!  There are some good songs, there are more bad songs.  The only good ones are the 1st track, shut up, apl song, and the radio releases.  Buy with discretion!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped has to be one of the best albums I've heard in a long, long, long time. I honestly don't know anyone who couldn't find one song they could enjoy. It breaks down barriers, and it has definitely changed my outlook on Christina.  <br />Although the album cover, and booklet, does make you think this should be a PARENTAL ADVISORY album, it isn't. It is like Xtina says, her \\"emotionally stripped\\". But maybe if she wanted her point to get across, she should have put some clothes on.  <br /> <br />From the moment you put the CD on, you are put inside Christina's mind. It starts with clips of media abuse towards her. It goes over \\"Xtina, Britney Rivals\\", \\"Fred Durst\\", and many 'bleeped' out cursing at her. It end with a reporter saying \\"Were gonna let Christina tell her side of the story.\\" And that she does. <br /> <br />Down falls of the album have to be \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\". The mainly sexual songs. I just didn't really like them.  <br /> <br />Highlights have to be without a doubt, \\"Make Over\\", \\"I'm Ok\\", \\"Loving Me For Me\\", and \\"Infatuation\\". Although many aren't fans of \\"Make Over\\" it's the reason I bought this CD. I heard some of the song and went nuts over it. It's a kind of Mexican-Rock song. Even though Christina does swear through it, she's screaming so it's kind of faded.  <br /> <br />Over all, the entire album is excellent, and definitely worth the wait for Christina fans. I do recommend it to anyone over 13. Parents, there isn't an extreme amount of swearing or sexual content but I do recommend you wait to buy it for your kids.  <br />
6305692572|5.0|Meg should have gotten top billing for this movie. Her portrayal of an alcoholic was right-on. I recommend this movie for those living with an alcoholic in recovery. It focuses on finding the solutions, not just poking at the problems alcoholics cause in families and relationships. It presents to spouses the concept of \\"letting go\\" and \\"caring about\\" versus \\"caring for.\\"
B000089RVX|4.0|Let me introduce you to Evanescence. A band out of Little Rock, coming from an unknown label, and getting its big break on a movie soundtrack. Who would have thought this band could go 5x platinum and have 10 million records sold worldwide.  <br />Well... Fallen is the result. The album that got them where they are.  <br /> <br />Between the strong guitars of Ben Moody and the chilling vocals of Amy Lee, this album is a stand out. <br /> <br />Although the songs to tend to sound the same the first few times you listen to them, each song is unique. \\"Imaginary\\", \\"Taking Over Me\\", \\"Whisper\\", and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" have to be extreme highlights.  <br /> <br />I love every song on this album and I love the band. So I guess I have a kind of bias opinion. But I do recommend you listen to this album. You will probably enjoy something on it.  <br />
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER CREATED. I AM DYING TO BUY THE DVD.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora is awesome.  <br />Forget what all those people say about Hybrid Theory being better. In my opinion, Meteora is better. It just takes my breath away.  <br /> <br />\\"Don't stay\\" starts the album off, and gives you an awesome feel, but it quickly goes into the over played hit \\"Somewhere I Belong\\". Although I love the song, it does get annoying after a while. Other highlights of the album have to be songs like \\"Hit the Floor\\", \\"Lying from You\\", \\"Figure .09\\", (I have no idea why that song is called that...) and \\"Nobody's Listening\\".  <br /> <br />But the best song on the album has to be \\"Breaking The Habit\\". It's so catchy and emotional. When I first received the CD, I didn't understand it. But after seeing people go through the subjects of this emotional song, my opinion on it changed. It seems to go inside the minds of people dealing with these problems. It's haunting and moves anyone who listens to it.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album. It's excellent and it makes me feel proud to be a LP fan.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Gene Roddenberry is said to have sold Star Trek to the studio \\"suits\\" as \\"Wagon Train in Space.\\"  Maybe Firefly could be called \\"Outlaw Josey Wales in Space\\" (insert reverb sound effect).  I will not recap the plot, or the well deserved denunciations of corporate bean-counters for not recognizing what a gem this show was and strangling it in the crib.  These can be found in abundance in other reviews.  I simply wish to add to the chorus of viewers who say that this was amazing TV - not a phrase I find myself using much these days.  Great concept.  Great actors.  Great dialogue.  Great special effects.  Great fun.  I missed the show during its initial run.  I am delighted to have found it on DVD.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is a great album, the music is captivating and the lyrics are mesmerizing! A must have!
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilibrium has been compared to The Matrix time and time again on several viewpoints and after seeing both Equilibrium and all the movies in the Matrix trilogy, it made me think that maybe the directors of the Matrix should've given Christian Bale the role of Neo instead of Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br />Equilibrium is the story of what our world would be like if by chance World War 3 finally came to pass.  The world rulers learn that the reason for war is overwhelming bursts of emotion and decide that the only way to alleviate the problem is to nullify the ability to feel emotions or attachment to personal items and make it illegal, a crime called a \\"sense offense\\" that is punishable by death. <br /> <br />Those who live in this New World Order, known in the movie as the Tetragrammaton, take a senses-numbing drug called \\"Prozium\\" (hmmm...sounds like a rather well-known drug that does the same thing now)and the law is harshly enforced by specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics, who are trained in the art of the \\"gun kata\\" (think martial arts with some serious firepower in your hand instead of swords/nunchuks). <br /> <br />The most senior Cleric is John Preston (Bale), a father of two whose wife was a \\"sense offender\\" and was tried and executed for the same crime that he is a fighter of.  One day Preston accidentally misses his dose and while investigating a case, begins to find himself feeling emotions long thought dead and assigned to take down the resistance fighters that want to take down the leader of this Order.  However, the more he gets into the case the stronger his emotions get and he begins to join the fight against the ones he once fought for in the Clerics, all while trying to resist the prying of his new partner (Taye Diggs) into his possible defection. <br /> <br />The action sequences are amazing, especially when Preston shows that you can do so much (virtually take down at least 6 people surrounding you) with so little (a space about thesize of a manhole cover to stand in), and in the final battle with the leader of the Tetragrammaton, Preston's partner, and Preston himself (let's just say that at one point, someone will learn a whole new meaning to \\"face-off\\"). <br /> <br />Bale shows that he can definitely convey a wide range of emotions and actions, and can definitely hold his own in a field of movie that has seemingly been out of his range in the past (Although I assume that this may have been the role that earned him the role of the Dark Knight in the upcoming \\"Batman Begins\\" next year). <br /> <br />And I will admit that there are definite plot slips throughout the movie. How are you going to be able to be angry at someone/smile at someone if you take a drug that is suppress the emotions that would cause you to do that (A seemingly slight slip committed by Diggs twice in the movie)? <br /> <br />Nevertheless, if you want to see what the Matrix would look like if the world that it took place in actually existed outside of a computer, then check out Equilibrium.
B000051Y0G|5.0|Cyndi, Cyndi, Cyndi. What can I say about this album and with it, ironically, you as an artist. You are one of my favorites. Really, one of my favorites of all time. And that is saying alot because my favorites of all time include Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, Prince, Led Zepplin, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Elton John and Earth, Wind And Fire. Not to mention Beethoven, and Duke Ellington! To many a casual listener this was the beginning and the end of your career. Emphasis on the \\"casual Listener\\" part. I know that you have recorded many a great song/album after this one but, to tell the truth, this is your finest work. It is also one of the best disc of the 80's. No, it's not a Joshua Tree, a Purple Rain, or a Synchronicity. Those albums are much deeper and very atmospheric. But if you measure greatness by what the artist picks as a concept and how they handle it, this is the best concept album of the decade! What is the concept? FUN!! Pure, clean, crazy fun. If you listen to this album there is no way for you not to get up and dance, shout and just have a great time. Let's look at the highlights.  Money Changes Everything: Cyndi's voice is great on this one. It's a mixture of punk rock and disco coupled with that irrisistable Brooklyn accent of her's. Great fun to kick off the disc. Girls Just Want To Have Fun: The female anthem of the decade. This song is great! Again Cyndi's vocals soar. So many people don't realize what great pipes she has. Really listen to this song to appreciate her voice. If \\"Money\\" didn't have you dancing, \\"Girls\\" will....unless you're DEAD! A bonafide classic.When You Were Mine: This is a cover of a Prince song and Cyndi does a great job with it.Time After Time: Cyndi opens the album with three steaming dance songs. With \\"Time\\" she lets us cool down a bit. This is the most covered song of her career. At last count there were 140 different artist who've covered it. The most famous and respected being Miles Davis. It's a thoughtful number with an aching melody. Another classic. She Bop: Time to shake your tailfeathers again! She Bop is the most sexual Cyndi gets in this album but it's in pure fun. Another great punk/dance song. All Through The Night: The last great single released from the album. Another achingly beautiful song made that much more beautiful because of Cyndi's voice. These are the highlights but the entire album is worth your time and money. If U2 wanted to make the most moody album of the 80's and many a decade, they did it with Joshua Tree. If Prince wanted to make the best album about pent-up sexual and personal frustration, he did it with Purple Rain. If Cyndi wanted to make the best party starting, let's just have some fun album, as superficial as it may be, she did it with this one. Of my top 10 albums of the 80's, this is number 10. Love you Cyndi. Keep on keepin' on!
B00005JNEI|3.0|I dont really care much for politics, I am non-partisan. It seems like the movie only shows one point of view and it's 100% negative against Bush. Moore revealed a lot of interesting stuff but it's hard to validate the facts until you get the other side of the story. A lot of stuff seems to be taken out of context. Moore made himself look like those close-minded right wingers except he is on the left wing. Politics has always had an \\"Us vs Them\\" mentality which makes it a big joke.
055357342X|5.0|Mr. Martin is indeed a fantastic author.  In my time reading fantasy, I have had the opportunity to enjoy the writing of many great writers and I must say that I would put George R.R. Martin at the top of the list.  I have read some criticisms of Martin's willingness to \\"kill off\\" major characters, yes it is depressing, but it is the fact that you know none of the characters is safe that makes the storyline so suspenseful.  Martin's characters have so much depth, evil characters have redeeming qualities and the heroic characters have flaws.  If I were to recommend one fantasy series to introduce someone to the genre it would be \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has come a long ways since her, \\"Genie in a bottle\\" days.  Her most recent album, Stripped, hit stores on October 29, 2002.  This album was a defining moment for her career.  It allowed us to see how she has matured since her first CD.  She wrote all of her own songs.  Christina takes her personal life experiences and puts them into catchy lyrics in, \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Fighter.\\"  Her songs on this album go against how society thinks women should live their lives.  That is why it is easy for women to relate to her songs.  My favorite song is \\"Beautiful,\\" when you listen to it, you can't help but feel good about yourself. So i encourage anyone, especially if you are a female, to go out and buy this album.  You won't be dissatisfied with the songs she sings.
B0000009SM|5.0|I can't call this my fave because there are so many Zappa discs to choose from but OSFA has got to be one of the best. This is Zappa at his finest. Lots of humor plus some of the finest musicianship ever recorded. Sofa #1 is one of the greatest Zappa instrumentals ever written (next to the \\"Black Page\\") George Duke's vocals fit the style of this era perfectly. Almost 30 years after it's release, this collection still sounds fresh & innovative. The complexities of the music on this disc will challenge even the most proficient musicians. Buy it!
B000002MU3|4.0|This is indeed not the most consistent album REM has ever made but this is a daring and creative experiment. Most the songs on this album are buried in loud guitars and drums and Michael's lyrics are again quite hard to decipher.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Name another artist who puts Pop, Blues, Jazz, country, soul, <br />Gospel and \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" on the same CD.  <br />Nobody else could and nobody else would. That's the genius of <br />Ray Charles. You never heard these songs sung this way before, <br />and unless you buy this CD you hear them sung this way anymore. <br />Stand-outs,include:\\"Sinners Plea\\" \\"Heaven Help Us All\\"  <br />\\"Crazy Love\\", Ray's own classic, \\"You Don't Know Me\\" <br />If only like one style of music, I feel sorry for you; <br />But if you cross musical borders and bounderies, <br />If you want to hear a lengend in his own time,sing with the <br />legends of today and tomorrow,if you collect music, buy this <br />cd. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Ray <br />is sometimes over powered by the company on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0736041850|5.0|This is the book I have in my gym bag. So whenever I go I have it. It helps me to design programs, also pictures are great. The only thing, I wish it would include more exesirces. <br />Highly recomended.
B000002ITM|5.0|I heard this album when I was 20 years old in 1991. It was one and only Album that I can never tired of listening. Its a classic Testament album. Why? Because it has Skolnick's lead playing and good clean production. The songs are just pure melodious. Maybe those who criticise this album is tone-deaf. They can listen to those speedy, thrashing, chordless, noteless metal songs. Too bad, Skolnick left the band and I found out their later albums just do not capture the same direction this album has. Where is Skolnick now anyway? This album basically made me want to play the electric guitar !!!!! I am still playing it though.
0714843377|4.0|I received this as a gift from a voracious reader like myself--had never heard of it or it author but found the advice very useful, which revolves around goal setting/accomplishing and innovation in a crowded marketplace, no matter what your field. Very clever in its pictorial/aesthetic design I might add. Worth it.
B00000DHRX|3.0|I lean towards the alternative end of the music spectrum, but I've always recognized George Michael's gifted vocals. Penetrating and brooding, comforting and spine-chilling, spiritual and soulful, electric and seductive. Something must be in the waters in his native Greece. The georgeous clarity of Karen Carpenter, pop-sensibility of Cliff Richard, and powerful soul/range of Stevie Wonder. What's interesting is that I'm more into production/arrangements, yet whenever I listen to a George Michael song, my attention is diverted away from anything resembling musical structure and towards the vocals. A wonderful, if not predictable, compilation of George Michael's hits. It's all there, from the orchestral serenade of 'Praying For Time' and ballad 'Careless Whisper' to the Madchester meets gospel 'Freedom 90', the soulful wails of 'One More Try' and breezy jazz of 'Kissing A Fool', to the inspiring 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me', sensuality of 'Father Figure' and rockabilly skiffle of 'Faith'. A great compilation if you like vocals and songwriting with range, power, and emotion. Forget the fluffy prettyboy image, the controversey, the mature balladeer, George Michael is one of the great male pop voices.
B000286RKW|5.0|<br /> <br />The beauty of Goodfellas is that it elegantly crystallizes all the tropes and themes inherent of the mafia/mob genre. The performances are high octane (Liotta) or elegantly understated (Deniro). As a tale of self-invention turned self-immolation, it is quintessential Scorcese. Along with the Godfather trilogy, I couldn't think of a more comprehensive take on a highly volatile and covert lifestyle.
B000002U82|5.0|Discovered by new generations. Many rediscovering it each generation. What more can be said about the timeless appeal of this landmark recording? This is much more than a space-prog soundscape, this is much more than a commentary on mental illness, this is an aural self-examination of your own personal demons. It is a soundtrack that confronts human neurosis, and ultimately realizing there is also hope in overcoming it. As many trends come and go, 'Dark Side Of The Moon' is the musical monolith, the progressive catharsis, that stands majestic in the face of time. A 43 minute journey into human condition, a musical metaphor concluding that to be crazy, is well, to be human. Introspective. Powerful. Mystical. Spiritual. Essential.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I am absolutely in love with Rammstein. I don't think there is any other band out there who has taken music and made it speak to me. It's emotional, sexy, rough, honest and beautiful. Listening to their music takes you on a trip to the darker side of human nature and also to the parts that most people are afraid to talk about. I want to say that although \\"Mutter\\" is the newest and is wonderful, you should also check out \\"Sehnsucht\\", \\"Herzeleid\\" and their new album \\"Reise, Reise\\" which will be coming out soon. Keep this band alive with your support! They are brilliant and really deserve all their success.~ Megan
B000268QB2|4.0|I first heard Keane's single \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on Sirius Satellite Radio, and searched to find out who the artist was.  I just bought the CD and have to say am pretty pleased with it.  Comparisons will be made to Coldplay, but this group does have a different sound than them.  I am really growing attatched to many of the songs, although the slow songs seem to lag a little bit.  You should definitely buy this cd and check them out!
B00005JNEI|1.0|It is unfortunate that so many people see this movie thinking that they are watching something real!  This is nothing more than politics by Michael Moore, who should just admit that he is a socialist and not interested in America.  It saddens me that he chooses to hide his traitorous ways under the guise of the First Amendment.  It is true that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it isn't even needed in Mooron's case.  All he is interested in portraying is his own ideals regardless of the truth.  In that respect, the First Amendment doesn't apply to his movie, because it is nothing more than a delusional drama/comedy.  If you want to see a farce, then go ahead and see this movie.  However, if you are interested in factual information about our country and the President, please, for the sack of those that are dying to protect the First Amendment, go and do your research elsewhere when deciding who to vote for for President.  That is the least you can do for those that have died, past and present, to protect this great nation.  Don't just vote, make an educated vote based on the \\"real\\" evidence and a clear understanding of the issues.
B00008H2LB|5.0|All I have to say is this, this is an awesome album, like others have said, not ground breaking, but awesome. I have to say this to some people, who think that LP, and Evanescence suck, do you not have eardrums? don't pull ignorance on me either. I have my share of old stuff Ex: Pink Floyd (Awesome) The Alan Parsons Project (Also Awesome) and many more. and I have to say that LP is one of the few bands who utilize the equipment that they have at their disposal, like the previously mentioned bands. If you want rage music, listen to something like Drowning Pool. This does not qualify as rage in the strictest sense. These guys know what they're doing, and they're not trying to go back in time to get their music (Ex. The Darkness, White Stripes, ect) great album, buy, and enjoy
B00003CXCT|3.0|I am a huge fan of Star Wars. YEs, I am an 'Original Fan\\". And why is being an 'Original' fan percieved so negatively? If you are an original Beatles fan, the newer fans ask you with reverence  what it was like seeing them in concert, etc. etc. (No, I am not fortunate enough to be an 'original' Beatles fan. I wasn't even born in 1964.) Original Star Wars fans are called oldtimers and accused of not letting go of the past and not appreciating that times change. <br /> <br />Mr. Rehnquist wrote in his review \\"I ask, who would want to see old, outdated movies in this age of advanced technology? \\" Well, I hope the answer is \\"Many People\\". My love of movies is not based on the level of special effects. Should we no longer watch the great old black and white films of the past because they are 'old and outdated'? No more Bogie and Bacall? No more Hepburn and Tracy? What about Gene Kelly? Jimmy Stewart?  <br /> <br />The thing Mr. Lucas is forgetting is that more is not always better- in an interview when the movies first came out, he was quoted as saying that the problem with the Sci-Fi genre in general was that so many moviemakers forgot about the story. The movies ended up being built around the special effects.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Mr. Lucas is adding all of these scenes and filming the newer movies (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) with nothing but the possibilities of these special effects in mind. He has lost the story; it had become secondary to the special effects.  <br /> <br />I had no problem with the celebratory scenes added at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" but I do have a problem with some of the other scenes. Han shot Greedo. Greedo did not shoot first. It is ridiculous to change this. Han's change of heart and redemption are more powerful when you know he was a mercenary! He was always looking out for himself. That's how he survived! He was in it for the money, and found himself inexplicably drawn to the people of the Rebellion. That's goodstory-telling. <br /> <br />The problem is that Mr. Lucas has taken the liberty of CHANGING much of the story with these scenes.  <br /> <br />Mos Eisley was supposed to be a dusty, deserted town. Tatooine is on the outer rim of the galazy. It's an unimportant, dusty, underpopulated planet. What I saw in the \\"Special Editions\\" was a thriving, well-populated town.  <br /> <br />I would happily buy the special edition versions if I knew Lucas intended on eventually releasing the original versions on DVD as well. I'd buy both.  <br /> <br />We're not trying to erase the movies you love. If you like the \\"Special Editions\\" Great! I am glad. I would never tell any of you to shut up or that your opinions were stupid and your views outdated as we have been told by Mr. Rehnquist. <br /> <br />We original fans aren't telling you new fans that the version we grew up with should be the only one out there. Please have the courtesy of relizing we are only asking for the opportunity to buy these movies the way we fell in love with them.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXA2|3.0|Forest Gump is a movie about a young man named Forest and he has a fair life with his mother.  Then he meets Jenny who he becomes best freinds with.  He graduates from college and joins the army and marries Jenny.  It is fair to watch, but not great.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I love how this movie gets either 5 or 1 star reviews.  Sign of the times, I guess.  Personally, I loved it.  Will you like it?  I have no idea.  Just watch the movie and make up your own mind.
B000002LPD|5.0|This album really sounds like a throwback to the best days of Van Halen in the '80's.  The obvious difference is Sammy Hagar.  Hagars' voice is really strong here and the music is great.  Eddie's guitar and Alex on drums have never sounded better.  I have to note here that on the song \\"Right Now\\" Alex's drums sound awesome!  That song alone is worth buying this one.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee is an outstanding new talent!  I rank her near the top of of today's many female jazz/standards singers, such as Diana Krall and Jane Monheit.  Renee stands out because she has more \\"attitude\\" and a healthy touch of \\"bravado\\" than most others - sort of like a female Sinatra.  That, together with the big band sound on some tracks, is OUTSTANDING!!!  Renee also sings warm, heartfelt, touching, gentle ballads.  There's one corny pop song which doesn't work for me, \\"Breaking Up is Hard to Do.\\"  Renee's singing style gives a contemporary sound to some old standards - a very \\"kewl\\" style as my kids would say.  To Renee: Your strength is in your unique and \\"kewl\\" interpretation of big band songs and standard ballads and bluesy songs. Try out more Sinatra-style arrangements.  The ones most like that on this CD are awesome!  You can bring many wonderful \\"standards\\" to a whole new generation!  Skip the light-weight modern pop stuff.  Hopefully for all of us, Renee will sing like this for a long, long time!
B00005JN7O|2.0|Just saw this flick this week per SciFi Museum tix. I had been excited about a Jude Law retro sci-fi (zeppelins should be in more movies!). But I was glad it was over. The LOTR soft focus gave bad headaches to me & pal, but worse, the movie was just bizarre. Conran went so far to do all CGI backgrounds, so why not make the actors CGI? The Iron Giant was a far superior retro sci-fi film and already blazed the giant robot trail (much less original films like Day the Earth Stood Still); Indy already blazed the serial trail; Blade Runner the noir; etc. Law is the only saving grace but I was sick of hearing about Dex and about that stupid camera. If it had been all CGI like Final Fantasy, I think it would have been more impressive. Paltrow's character is so annoying, why would someone as cool as Sky Captain even descend to her level? And it deliberately invoked so many films I think it went way too far in its \\"homage.\\" It did remind me of Rocketeer somewhat. Agh. I was expecting to be wowed, and I wasn't, but for a popcorn flick it is worth matinee price. The special effects are quite nice, anyway, and should win awards. But Conran needs a better plot in his next endeavor--and he will go far I think.
B000003RCY|5.0|This is the best album in mein oppinion made from Rammstein, there are acctually two versions of the Cover, one of which here shown und the US vertion...with all their faces und white backround. This collection of songs is good exspeacilly Seemann,Der Meister und Heirate Mich..If you are just getting unto the Rammstein now, und want a better song choose, buy this one first, it shows the emotions of their feelings from their truble marrages with wifes and very powerfull melodys, which one may uderstand most if lissioning to the songs.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie captured the many striking elements of the book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  As the book represented a sort of turning point for the Potter series, so does the film.  Keep in mind that this vision of the novel--for it's not a rote, verbatim adaptation, and is in line with Rowling's wishes--is Alfonso Cuaron's. He owns this film, and he brings out the tension and excitement from the young stars in a way that makes the characters seem real.   <br />It's by turns hilarious, poignant, nerve-wracking (even when I already knew the plot!), frightening, and non-stop.  A great flick, fun for any age.  Also it has John Williams' best score in many years.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I can't really comprehend what it is that has made this album have such a lasting effect. By no stretch of the imagination is Pink Floyd up to par with bands such as The Beatles or The Rolling Stones for example, but this album is something special. Sure, everyone knows who The Beatles or The Stones are but these two gods of rock have never had a single album that has reached out to as many people as this album has.  <br /> <br />From the first day this album was released, in those weed-smoking, acid-dropping 70s, this album hit home to countless people. Whether it was just from the incredible sounds of songs like \\"Breathe\\" or the all-to-real message delivered in songs like \\"Money\\" or \\"Time\\", this album had something for everyone out there, and eventually, something for everyone's children and their children's children. Just to illustrate this, take a tour around any planetarium and I'm sure you will find a Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon laser show. <br /> <br />Personally, I am particular to \\"Time\\". This song, apart from having a place in my heart due to the countless times I've heard this song with my father, touches me with the lyrics. Typically being someone that bites off more than I can chew, I always seem to find myself running out of time. The intro to this song is legendary and nothing produced to this day doesn't even come close in comparison . Once the lyrics finally come in...it's safe to say I've reached nirvana. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd, in the same way as other bands, has many other great albums with unforgettable songs - \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" to name a few - but with this album they have finally let it all come together with the right combination of incredible writing, outstanding performances, and unforgettable messages. Just as Metallica has the \\"Black\\" album as their calling card but ads Ride the Lightning and Justice for All to the list of great albums, Pink Floyd has Dark Side of the Moon as their calling card but albums like The Wall and Wish You Were Here to cement their place as a great band.
B00009Z574|3.0|I once saw an Amazon reviewer say that he thought all Yes albums should get five stars.  The problem is that sometimes our favorite bands don't produce the albums they're capable of.  Someone who buys \\"Tormato\\" as their first Yes album instead of \\"Close to the Edge\\" is a lot less likely to ever buy another Yes album.  Coming off the incredible \\"Going for the One\\", this album was a huge disappointment.  The sound quality doesn't help:  1) the production is mediocre; 2) Chris Squire wanted his bass to be a lead instrument, so the treble on his Rickenbacker is mixed way up and there's not much bottom end; and 3) Rick Wakeman does all his synthesizer work on a Polymoog, one of the first synths that could play more than one note at a time, but a cheap, tinny sounding instrument (it sounds just as bad on Genesis' \\"Duke\\" album). <br /> <br />Still, the songwriting is the biggest problem.  Only \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is up to the standards of Yes' best work, and maybe 3 of the 8 songs might have been good enough to make it onto \\"Going for the One\\".  The UK single \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" is pretty good except for the shouts of \\"Dig it!\\" which the world had stopped saying 5 years earlier.  \\"Arriving UFO\\" has perhaps the catchiest melody on the album, and Steve Howe comes up with a guitar solo that sounds almost like a vocal.  None of the other songs are really bad, they're just not good ENOUGH to make for a satisfying Yes album.  US single \\"Release, Release\\" (which I never once heard on the radio) and \\"Future Times/Rejoice\\" might have been more memorable with better production.  Squire's \\"Onward\\" is as simple and straightforward a love song as Yes has ever done.  \\"Circus of Heaven\\" has one of Jon Anderson's better lyrics but the music screams \\"outtake\\".  Speaking of which, this reissue includes a ton of outtakes, but I can't bring myself to buy this album again just so I can hear them. <br /> <br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00005NTNU|5.0|I knew that I would fully enjoy the movies.  I was right, they are still great.  The cardboard sleeves for the individual movies were almost destroyed just trying to get them open.  I will be relocating them to new cases, no doubt.  Sure is a shame for such a collection to be packaged in such flimsy material..

0596000480|5.0|If you're already an experienced programmer, it can be frustrating trying to find a good book on JavaScript (aka JScript, aka ECMAScript, aka ECMA-262). A lot of books out there are aimed at HTML developers, maybe even graphic designers. Many such users have little or no real programming experience, and maybe no real interest. Books for that audience are user-friendly, filled with useful examples, and low on scary-sounding technical terms. In other words, almost useless.<br /><br />Flanagan has good credentials as a technical writer, and as a highly technical writer. He really knows what software engineers look for - trust me, it's not what a graphic designer looks for.<br /><br />This starts with a clear, methodical description of the language. Flanagan goes through all the language basics, pointing out where JavaScript differs form languages like Java, C#, or C++. The differences are numerous. For example, JavaScript has typed data, but not typed variables. It's object oriented, but doesn't have classes. It's an interpreted language, not compiled, and that opens up generative programming possibilities that reflection APIs can't approach.<br /><br />After the language itself, Flanagan presents it in the client-side HTML context, where it appears most often. That's about 20% of the book. It goes over all the common HTML features, and shows how JavaScript can add dynamics or configurability to most HTML features. The last part of this section discusses XML and the DOM model. It does not yet discuss the E4X standard, ECMAScript for XML, the new ECMA-357 standard. As of this writing, the standard has only been out for three months, though. I'm sure Flanagan will catch up to it soon.<br /><br />The book's remaining three sections cover the language's basic APIs, the APIs needed in the client-side HTML context, and the DOM model. The first two are fundamental to any non-trivial use of the language, the last is the programming model that gives access to XML or XHTML in a rational, predictable way.<br /><br />JavaScript has a number of very different user communities, with different needs when it comes to language documentation. This isn't a cut&paster's book, and is nothing at all like a training guide. It's a reference manual. If you're a serious techie, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />//wiredweirdTML in a rational, predictable way. <br /> <br />JavaScript has a number of very different user communities, with different needs when it comes to language documentation.

B00005JMXX|3.0|After seeing the trailers for this film, my expectation of what to expect you could say was quite high.  Up to half way through it seem to maintain a reasonable level of interest and a warm fuzzy feeling of Natures backlash and something that you did not get from Armaggeddon or Independance Day (Americans save the world - again!!!).  From there on the cracks in the film, like the climate of the earth seemed to be more clearly visible, and a yawn factor took over.   <br /> <br />Not to dispute a clear display of technical genius and wizardry from the special effects team - but it seemed that when money was being distributed the script writers clearly got the bum deal. <br /> <br />Watch this film with a low expectation and do not take seriously - with a subject so close to the truth, experts say, they could have reviewed the storyline first.
B000002MIB|1.0|The final death knell in my Van Halen fanaticism.  I grew up loving this band, but with each susequent release, I realized how I had outgrown them and how they had lost their steam.   <br /> <br />First, the sound.  This album sounds like it was recorded (porrly) in a studio and then a loop of a 500,000 person audience was played over it.  Kiss Alive 1 was a more believable sounding live album.....and most of it wasn't live!!  At not one point does it feel like there is any connection with the audience.   This think makes Live Without a Net seem intimate.  <br /> <br />Second, Sammy.  Oh, Sammy Sammy Sammy.  You stink bro.  Your between song banter is the most moronic I have ever heard.  Your screams are forced and your lyrics stink.    <br /> <br />The guitar sound:  Way too distorted.  What the hell IS that crap?  If any of you have ever heard the Pasadena 77 bootleg, you KNOW that this can't be the same band or guitar player.  I don't care if it's 15 years later!!!   <br /> <br />In short, stay away
B000002NC4|5.0|1997's Perfect From Now On, Built to Spill's 3rd full album, marks a major departure from their previous album \\"There's Nothing Wrong with Love\\".  Both albums are deeply emotional; however, if \\"Nothing Wrong\\" is a journal entry after a successful first date, full of hope and enthusiasm, then \\"Perfect From Now On\\" is that same journal 9 months later, crumpled up, slightly burned, and left dejected in the trash.  Songs like \\"I Would Hurt A Fly\\" and \\"Untrustable/Part 2 (About Someone Else)\\" speak of betrayal and heartbreak, lost love and identity.  The most significant differences between this album and \\"Theres Nothings Wrong With Love\\" are structures of the songs.  \\"Perfect From Now On\\" contains eight lengthy tracks that flow in and out of various melodies, conveying the shattered emotional state of the songwriter whose thoughts are both scattered and focused, a musical expression of anger and loss.  And one hell of a listen on top of it.

B00005MAM2|5.0|I saw akira not too long ago. I thought that it is one of the greatest anime's i have ever seen. I suggest all of you that like anime that you have to think about. Not just straight up where someone gets killed and that's it. You actually have to think about the ending. Yes, there's a twist. And, kind of like a really good episode of the Twilight Zone. A MUST SEE!!!!
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan Rocks!  this CD is very upbeat, and it just makes you want to jump up and down.      oh yeah...for the person asking about the \\"bald guy\\" his name is Jeff, and YES i do care about him.      If you aren't the type of person that goes bashing every band that some ppl may think is \\"punk\\", but you think otherwise (because what actually is the definition of \\"punk\\". i would like to know what one u r going by.)...then u should buy this CD.     P.S. i'm not a preppy snob!!!!
0743526724|5.0|In virtually all circumstances where people are working together, they come to agreement in ways that short-change the interests of everyone involved. This landmark book shows practical ways to find out what other people want, and to devise better alternatives that create a \\"win\\" for everyone. The authors do a great job of overcoming the preconception that many hold that working on problems means that you have to be unpleasant. The advice to be hard on the problems and easy on the people (building a relationship) is a key concept that everyone can use. I have found this book to be one of the most helpful that I have every read, and I cite its lessons in my own book. I recently had a chance to use these principles in a negotiating workshop with veteran negotiators, and I was struck by how few people apply the lessons of GETTING TO YES. You will vastly improve your life if you read and practice the ideas in GETTING TO YES.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|[...] Who on the planet doesn't already know these tracks?  The value of the release is clear in the title....these are the full recordings just as they went onto tape....and it is very nice to hear the band at their final session.....they did work together....they did get some nice bits going.....I find that refreshing and although I don't play this one constantly, it comes out on occasion because it is the last moments of 4 people who influenced me greatly and I like hearing them together one last time.  So there......you get exactly what is advertised!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is known for his mix of a soft and smooth like silk voice and acoustic sounds.  I am a college student and most college students are burying their heads into finely printed text books, if not partying and goofing off.  I was looking for something easy to listen to and study at the same time which is why I was tempted to buy Jack Johnson's latest cd.  I sat in the nearest Starbucks, put on my earphones, and opened my textbook.  To my surprise I was able to achieve my goal of doing my reading for my next day of classes.  When was the last time you were able to sail through your homework without being distracted of the overloaded beats in some of your other music?  Listening to this cd made me picture a laid back drive around the island with top down and the sun on my shoulders.  This cd actually gave me an incentive to do my homework.  His smooth sound will keep you pressing the replay button on your cd, I promise!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Worth every penny, especially Ravi Shankar.....what a beautiful family he has.  George's family, his friends, my word....what an absolutely fantastic gathering at Albert Hall.  I'm positive that George would have loved it all.....Billy Preston getting down.....Eric Clapton and everybody else just concentrating on making sure every note was for George.  Without a doubt this is the nicest piece of excellent playing released on DVD so far....and yes, you do see George in your dreams for days after you watch it.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Collateral, the new action-thriller from Michale Mann is more than satisfactory, it's one highly enjoyable ride loaded with thrilling performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  Michael Mann of course has crafted many great thrillers incluing Manhunter, Thief and the superb Heat.  Other films he is notable for are The Insider, which earned him his Oscar-nomination, Ali and THe Last of the Mohicans.  <br />     Foxx who steals the movie from Cruise plays Max, a cab driver.  He's worked as one for 12 years and before he picks up Cruise he meets Jada Pinkett Smith's character, who he soons becomes friendly with.  Then we meet Vincent played wonderfully by Cruise, with his salt and pepper hair and shades.  Max soon learns that Cruise is a hitman and that he's in a dangerous situation.  The suspense and tension build up and we reach an exciting and intense climax.  This is probably one of the more enjoyable films of the summer, I mean we've got good action, acting, story and suspense, what more could you ask for.  The movie isn't perfect but it proves to be a great and remarkbly smart and well-crafted thriller.  Possibly worth owning on Video and DVD. <br />      Collateral is rated R for Violence and Language.  The mayhem includes shootings, stabbings, fights and chases.  THe violence isn't especially bloody, graphic or deafening.  THe action is surprisingly good and there's plenty, but probably not enough to satisfy hardcore action fans.  The language is fair, not constant but a substantial amount.  Overall a great thriller, worth seeing in the theatre.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Just look at the genuine buzz on these guys if you want to know if they're any good.  When the Cesters, Muncey and Wilson turn it on it's all attitude and crash......pure hard rock.  Sure, everybody's heard Are You Gonna Be My Girl by now, but line up Last Chance, Get Me Outa Here, and Take It Or Leave It and your ears will be ringing and you won't be able to get the riffs out of your head for weeks.  This band has it now......watch for the next one......they could be the next rebirth of rock.....it's time for hip and hop and rap to go under anyway....
B00005JMAH|5.0|First of all I am sick and tired of people saying its \\"Not exactly like the book\\". Who would want to sit through a 5 hour page by page exact visual representation of a 300 page book? Its a disgusting idea. Secondly, I can't sit through a movie and believe that a castle in scotland, has miles of bright green grass surrounding it, its not logical. Its as if Chris Columbus tried desperatly to create some magical land, but ended up creating some sort of childess mess. Thirdly, I think its idiodic for people to believe that if Alfonso Cuaron had created a page by page movie, that it would break records. No one wanted to go to the theatre to SEE a book, a BOOK is meant for READIING, a MOVIE is meant for VIEWING! They are two completly different forms of storytelling.  <br /> <br />Now to the Good stuff. My favorite part of the newest movie is how the director doesn't just shove magic under your nose and is like \\"this is magic, except it\\". He creates a world filled with magic, if you watch closely in such seens as the leaky cauldron and the shreiking shack. Sure they perform spells, but its not SOO stupid looking. The dialogue is much better too, the books are not aimed at 3 year olds, therefor the movies should not be, (Even if it was a page by page, the dialogue would be less childess, Chris really needs to learn his stuff) The Dialouge in this movie is much more complex, and deep.  <br /> <br />The only thing that I can think of thats terrible is the final shot of harry on his broom, its idiodic. but thats only maybe 2 seconds, otherwise if I am interested in watching a HP MOVIE~(not read a book) this would be the first one I would reach for.  <br />
B00005QXDD|5.0|This cd is well worth the price.  It is smart funny and belive it or not but Jack and Kyle are really talented muscians.  Jack may joke around but he can sing.  I am still waiting for a new LP he should work with Liam Lych.
B00008OWZC|4.0|At least they would only need to remaster it instead of trying to modify all the outdated recording on the tapes. I mean, they waited over 30 years to release this. If this was a greatest hits album or a compilation release, then it would make sense, but this is a live recording! Come on, ever heard of Alive by Kiss, that was their first megaselling record and they had it recorded onto the record while playing! It was released in I'd say 5 months, but if that is too soon for most of you, I got another one. March 19,1982, a day that will live as one of heavy metal's most tragic as legendary young Ozzy guitarist Randy Rhoads dies in a plane crash. Five years later, Ozzy releases Tribute, the only recordings of Ozzy's band with Randy Rhoads live, this album has been remastered two times. What am I telling you, I'm telling you that these guys waited a full birth-to-middle age period before releasing this while they could have made it only a few years after the infamously overated 4th Led Zeppelin album. But the positives are that it is PURE AWESOMENESS! BUY THIS ALBUM NOW! IT IS GREAT, ALL CHILDREN SHOULD READ THIS ALBUM LIKE A BIBLE!
0345440900|2.0|I got this book at a gift at my shower. I started reading it while pregnant and it seemed logical and reasonable at first, but then I started getting stressed out. So many details in the guise of making your life simple. What kind of baby do you have? Can you figure out how to read his signs? Follow baby's lead... Ugh, it all seemed like too much to factor in and if you get it wrong you start all kinds of bad habits in your baby. Give me a break, this is a baby, they don't get bad habits until later.
1592400876|4.0|Truss's book was as entertaining as it was informative, and considering this is a book on punctuation, that's saying a lot.  Despite Truss's \\"no tolerance\\" claim, she is willing to point out that punctuation rules are far from consistent; what was commonplace fifty years ago would be laughed at today (for example, could you imagine someone writing \\"to-morrow\\"?).  Many issues are simply a matter of style (the \\"Oxford comma\\" or the optional \\"s\\" in \\"Truss's\\") or determined by which side of the Atlantic you're from.  Truss may state which she prefers, or uses, but rarely does she call one right and the other wrong.<br /><br />For this reason among others, Truss's book will probably never replace any manuals of style- but even if it simply causes people to be more aware of punctuation then I think it's a worthwhile book.  I will never roam the streets with an apostrophe on a stick, yelling \\"Sticklers unite!\\" but if awareness of this book results in fewer \\"Book's\\" or mixed up \\"whose/who's\\" and \\"its/it's\\", I for one will be a happier person.  To paraphrase Truss: let's stop using punctuation like stupid people.
B00005JMUA|4.0|<br /> <br />One thing renowned director Quentin Tarantino can do really well is pull off tongue-in-cheek humor while still maintaining a certain edge of 'coolness'. Once again, the film maker enforces his wild dreams while growing up, by churning out a solidly rich looking movie. There still lies that really nice transition of black and white scenes accompanied by even the cheesy camera angles that could be found in classic 'grind' style movies. In particular, during a scene where leading lady Uma Thurman receives some training from the kung fu master. The music also highlights the movie nicely, Rza of Wu Tang Clan fame steps up to the plate to mixing some smooth in-house beats, there is also a good dosage of Spanish-esque music to go along with the spaghetti western themes. On a purely aesthetic level, Kill Bill Vol. 2 doesn't overcome the standards set by the original then again, this sequal is instead focused on trying to give some proper development on a admittedly flat cast of characters.  <br /> <br />With all the talk surrounding Mel Gibson's - \\"Passion of the Christ\\", I wondered why Kill Bill Vol. 1 was never the center of attention. After all--it was hands down one of the bloodiest movies made this side of a hollywood release. Well guess what, Tarantino decided to trade in all the gore for a more story-oriented approach. The movie starts off in El Paso at the wedding chapel where Uma Thurman as \\"the bride\\", was gunned down by her soon-to-be nemesis Bill played by David Carradine. It's time for revenge and the mission at hand needs to be completed, simple right when it is to kill Bill. Uma Thurman is eventually caught by one of Bill's henchmen, acted by Michael Madsen. \\"The bride\\" is tossed in a coffin after her prized sword was taken, eventually with flashback reiterating some strenghth in her mind, \\"the bride\\" crawls out of the coffin to pay back Madsen. Eventaully we learn of her identity, it turns out to be Beatrix, soon the villianous one-eyed Daryl Hannah comes around center field. The two square off in the movie's only true fight scene. What a grand one it is, and I was kinda amused at how everyone got so involved and even squeeled a bit after the gross conclusion to the battle of Thurman and Hannah. After that, Bea is off to South America where she meets up with a pimp who informs her of Bill's not-so coveted abode. I wasn't sure what to make of the static dialouge exchanged between Bea and Bill. See, in the past particularly a movie such as Resovoir Dogs, Tarantino played a way of comedic genius while still retaining a \\"b\\" movie feel of dialogue. The talking runs on a little dryer than what I expected and it turns out...Bea's child was never killed. In any case Bill didn't put up the fight I personally felt he should've have. In a twisted way, the movie played out nicely in the sequal instead focusing on the development of it's characters.  <br /> <br />In a twisted way, the movie played out nicely in the sequal instead focusing on the development of it's characters. I was a little jagged in excitement because I thought there should've been a lot more action just as in the original, after all that's what set Vol. 1 so high on everyone's list and besides Tarantino is just a complete mastermind at mending good fight scenes. At the end of the day I didn't mind the thicker plot, at times the cheesy lines might weaken the story's power, but in the end Kill Bill Vol. 2 still manages to please. It's irresponsible, poses graffiti laid out on the nature of instantgratified adolescents all over and is a hell of a lot of fun to watch. I can only close with this, anyone who wants a technically unmarred movie with a good hint at pop culture and serves as a summation for the epitaph of Tarantino's contribution to the film world. Than this is your movie boyee!  <br />
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Combining layer upon layer of sound, the music of The Passion is not something you can just listen to.  You will get completely caught up in the rise and swell of music that is occaisionally accompanied by an amazing choir.  This is one of the best scores ever and it serves to help you relive each moment on-screen.  Even those who have never seen the movie can find themselves completely enthralled with it.  It carries a story of its own.  This music MAKES the movie!  I'd recommend it to anyone who truly appreciates music.
B00003CXA6|5.0|We had the fairly unique experience of visiting Gettysburg Battlefield while on vacation.  We bought the DVD of \\"Gettysburg\\" at the gift shop, watched it that night, and went back the following day for a more in-depth battlefield tour. <br /> <br />Actually visiting the places where, for example, the 20th Maine made its desperate stand, brought a lot more meaning to the movie. <br /> <br />Jeff Daniels stole the show as the scholar-turned-soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His sidekick, the \\"tough old Mick\\" Kilrain, who called him \\"Colonel, Darlin,\\" without being the least bit disrespectful, was perfect. The heart-stopping moment when Chamberlain realizes that his men are out of ammunition and must nonetheless keep the Confederates from reaching the summit of Little Round Top makes the viewer wonder: \\"What, in the name of God, would I do in that situation?\\" When Chamberlain orders his men to \\"fix bayonets,\\" and then charge downhill, it's an awesome thing. <br /> <br />I liked Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought that he had the Virginia accent down pretty well for a \\"furriner,\\" and he carried a weary dignity about him.  It was said of Lee that his men would, and often did, follow him into Hell.  Sheen's portrayal suggested that kind of magnetism. <br /> <br />This isn't a movie to go into without having done your homework first.  It really helps to know something about how the Civil War was going up to that point, who the major players were, and what the main issues were. There are so many characters and so many shifts back and forth that you can get a disoriented \\"Who's on First\\" kind of feeling. Reading Michael Shaara's book first would also be very helpful. <br /> <br />I found Tom Berenger's portrayal of General Longstreet to be up to his usual high standard, but the makeup people who pasted his beard on did a horrible job.  It made him look like a dimestore Santa. <br /> <br />One note that I found interesting was that the Yankees fought for the Union. Period.  The Confederates, on the other hand, fought for their individual states.  The Virginians, for example, fought for mother, home and family - and the honor of Virginia.  They thought of themselves not as Confederates, or even Americans, but first and foremost, as Virginians. <br /> <br />This movie is not light, mindless entertainment.  It is demanding and emotionally wrenching.  Gettysburg is part of our history - a part of who we are.  <br /> <br />This telling of the story is absolutely first-class.  <br /> <br />
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This is one great album.  Same great voice, different sound. <br />I have all three albums and I enjoy them all.  The first two were funky pop/r&b gems, but she has changed her sound for this one - more of a rock edge - and it sounds great.  Though I like all of the tracks, my favorite one is the first one, Seasons Change.  What a sound!  Heavy guitars. Just comes at you. Wow. <br />She has the voice to sing whatever she wants, but her vocals are more impassioned on this album, like she believes in the songs more.  Given the events of her life recently, it's no wonder. <br />Fans will like this but it will be a shock to those expecting Freak of Nature Part 2. <br />With this lady's talent, she deserves to be heard. <br />You must get this album! <br /> <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is an excellent CD! Gavin is a phenomenal artist, and this is one of the best CD's I have purchased in a long time.  I highly recommend it!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I wont go over exactly what this DVD package includes... you can research that on your own.  I only want to say that the extras on these disks are PHENOMENAL.  A lot of things are said in these extras that I'm suprised were allowed.  That shows courage from the studio, and they have to be commended for it... to let the actors/producers/directors really say what was on their minds.  It all comes across as HONEST, and I learned stuff that I didn't know.  You can learn a lot about yourself, and if you have what it takes to survive, from these documentaries.  They taught me that storytelling is more than just having a vision... it's having what it takes to see it through to completion, despite what you have in front of you.  Even if it's the crew.  It took me DAYS to watch the extras (like a week), and I still haven't seen everything.  The short documentaries are as EXCITING as the movies themselves.  This is one of the best DVD buys I've ever made, and this is what DVD releases should be like.  Extras that are WORTH at least twice the price of the item.  BUY from Amazon NOW!!!

B00028HBKM|1.0|Disturbing and down right anti-Semitic look at the last days of Christ is a real look of how the Christian right will do anything to portray their hatred. Where's the miracle in all of this bloodshed? Was Jesus himself a Jew? Why were the Jews only single out for this?  Anybody who even thinks that what's in this movie has any truth to it should be ashamed of themselves.  This is more Christian propaganda than a real religious film and if there is any justice in the world, this film will show them for the bigots and the hate mongers they are. <br /> <br />I used to be a Mel Gibson fan but after this, no more.  <br />
B0001AP12G|4.0|I'm late at reviewing this album, I'm sure by now there's like five videos, and Jesus Walks is banging in the clubs.  I gave this album a four star due to a great deal of reasons.  The main thing is the messege, Kanye creates an album that is very human, he explores a whole gamut of life experiences.  He talks about college, God, the hip-hop game, women.  Kanye also manages to have an amazing guest appearances to accompany his tracks.  They include MCs from on end of the spectrum to the other.  MCs like Jay Z, Twista, Talib Kweli, and Common are just a few.  The album cant be classified as gangsta or hip-pop, it's something new, and if people dont have this album yet, then go on, pick it up.    I'm Out!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|In \\"The Fog of War,\\" what we have is the fascinating, disturbing, perplexing, riveting, and sometimes maddening confession/explanation/\\"lessons-learned\\" exercise of a formerly powerful \\"lion,\\" now in the late winter of his life and looking for...well, something.  The \\"lion\\" here is Vietnam War era Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara, one of the \\"best and the brightest\\" of his era, and one of the most controversial - both admired and reviled -- figures in American history.  Like the other Kennedy/Johnson \\"best and brightest\\" intellectuals, McNamara attended the finest schools - Berkeley and Harvard - and rose to positions of great power, both in World War II as a top advisor to Colonel (later Genera) Curtis LeMay, as President of Ford Motor Company, and finally as Secretary of Defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.   <br /> <br />A student of philosophy, economics, and business administration, McNamara brought a fascinating, even unique, mix of skills to his job as Secretary of Defense during the 1960s.  Ultimately, however, despite McNamara's great intellectual abilities and fine educational background, in the end it can only be said that he was a miserable failure, in both the practical and moral senses.  For starters, McNamara must accept a significant part of the blame for the hubris, mistakes, misjudgments, and moral failings that characterized the entire Vietnam era.  More fundamentally, McNamara's entire approach, which was essentially to use data, statistics, and logical analysis techniques to bring hard rationality and cold efficiency to the inherently irrational, inefficient, unreasonable, chaotic, and bloody \\"fog\\" of war, led not to success but instead to disaster - in economic, national, and human terms.   As McNamara himself now concludes, in one of his 11 \\"lessons\\" that form the organizational structure of this movie, \\"rationality will not save us.\\"   <br /> <br />In \\"The Fog of War,\\" we watch and listen as McNamara attempts - forcefully, articulately, emotionally, and often awkwardly -- to explain his life as an individual human being and also as part of the broader picture; to admit that he made errors while at the same time shifting the blame for his (many) failings to others (Curtis LeMay, President Johnson) and failing to take full personal responsibility for his actions; to convey the lessons he feels he has learned from his life while simultaneously failing to follow those lessons to their logical conclusions or to integrate them in a coherent, non-self-contradictory manner; to hint at his own psychological/emotional struggles as a public and private figure while again stopping short of truly revealing much of his inner life (i.e., he mentions that his years as Secretary of Defense caused great hardship - tremendous stress, ulcers - for his family, yet he refuses to say more than that and still holds that those were great years of his life); and to wrestle - a bit belatedly and weakly, one might add -- with philosophical questions of right and wrong, such as \\"in order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.\\" <br /> <br />As McNamara speaks, we also watch and listen to the historical images and audio recordings of World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam.  As McNamara stares at us directly (yet blankly, evasively, and disconcertingly - what is he thinking and feeling?), we also hear and feel the ominous, foreboding, anxious, vaguely disturbing Philip Glass score pulsing along in the background.   The combination of all these elements results in a powerful documentary film that fully deserved its Academy Award. <br /> <br />Just three more (brief) points about \\"The Fog of War:\\" 1) this movie should be required viewing for all of our top political and military leaders; 2) those leaders include, first and foremost, the current Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, who bears an unnerving resemblance to Robert McNamara in many ways; and 3) if it does nothing else, this movie powerfully argues for not placing too much faith in our leaders, because as McNamara's Cuban Missile Crisis example points out so well, they often are just as confused, caught up in their own misconceptions, stuck in their own worldview, and dependent upon blind luck as the rest of us.  <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is pretty much my all time favorite band. and this album simply tops it all off. I recodmend all Rock and Roll lovers out there to buy this album. These guys really know their music, and put together their own magnificently. <br /> <br />LP ROCKS!!!
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of my all time favorite reads.  I haven't been able to read as much as I used to or would like to and I am so glad I made the time to get into this book.  This is by far one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read.  <br />Griet is wise beyond her years before becoming a maid for Vermeer's family and transforms into even more of a woman before our eyes.  This is not a book for someone who likes a fast moving plot, but it is for someone who appreciates sensuality - which requires time.
0385474547|5.0|This novel was recommended to me by a friend whom I trust very much in the arena of literature. He was on the mark once again. This book has some of the most precise, heavy prose I think I've ever had the privelege of reading. There is nearly no word in this novel that is superfluous. In fact rather than being a burden the weight of this novel was quite rewarding. This novel has made mewant to read every one of Achebe's works.
0425152251|2.0|This is not meant to be a comprehensive review.  I actually found the book quite interesting until I got to the point near the end of the book where the author attempts to describe Judaic and Christian philosophy.  One can infer from his writing that he subscribes to the notion that Christianity is the successor to Judaism, and that Judaism is now obsolete.  This is, of course, offensive to Jews.  Also, since I know that his understanding of the relationship of Judaism and Christianity is incorrect, it makes me doubt his knowledge of other philosophies.  I would otherwise have no reason to doubt the validity of the rest of the book, since this was an introduction to philosophy for me, but I now doubt the author's understanding of all the rest.
B000286RNY|4.0|There were several scenes in Shaolin Soccer that had me laughing and gaping in disbelief.  This flick is truly bizarre.  It does have its own distinctive style, but that style is so exaggerated, so over the top, so inexplicably weird, that it may lose some viewers.  To me, it is this sense of \\"anything goes\\" that puts this fantasy movie a step above most others.      If you thought the preview looked good, check it out.  It's better than you think.
B000268QB2|4.0|I don't know about that, but Keane, the pop sensation out of Britian is hoping to charm the U.S. as well. They just might, with their dreamy sound, great piano, and charming vocals. But this is the U.S. You have to have something unique around here, either that, or be a ripoff of another artist. These guys aren't ripoffs, but they're no OutKast either, so I don't think they can succeed in the United States. But if they do make it really big, they will continue to be compared to Coldplay, and their dreamy sound as well. These guys do not sound like Coldplay, which is good. They need their own sound, and they definitely aren't as \\"rocky\\" as Coldplay They are dream-pop at their heart, which isn't bad. They bring something new to the plate on the American music scene which is already a bit too full. Just listen to Somewhere Only We Know ten times and you will get the picture that these Keane is special, but maybe they aren't quite star material.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Getting ready for the upcoming trilogy DVD, I've done some research and read lots of opinions on George's changes to all of HIS films.  And I think that we won't even see all the reasons for these changes or be able to appreciate them until May 2005.  See, whether anyone likes it or not, the Star Wars saga is now going to be made up of 6 Films, just like George initially intended.  Six movies in the saga, not three.  If George wants his saga to have a little continuity, then why fight the artist?  And I have faith that watching Revenge of the Sith next May, we'll all be worshipping the almighty George Lucas again.  I have faith that all of George's changes to the original trilogy will make sense (even Hayden in ROTJ) and we might all have a little more respect for...(gasp)...Episodes I and II.  Yep, the world will be a pretty awesome place for Star Wars fans in the coming months.
B0002858YS|4.0|...but is it as good as it should be. The Killers are the latest arrivals to the glam music scene, and the first in quite some time. They combine everything 80s with everything 90s for a sound that I personally love. No, these rockers from Las Vegas(?)can not compete with David Bowie, but they are certainly a good bunch of artists that can definitely compete on the music scene of today. They can compete today because they bring what everyone wants to hear but can't quite put their finger on. The Killers are incredible artists, that are certainly glamourous in their music and are over the top. The only problem is that they are new, but their mental state is that they are a phenomenon, which isn't too far from the truth. I am excited to hear from them, and to see how they do covering new ground on the music scene. For any David Bowie or glam fans out there will definitely want to check out The Killers for a taste of something new.
B00008BRB5|5.0|I still like this album, even if I waited a few years to get it.  This is some very well done pop!  Every Breath You Take, still a classic.  Synchronicity II--very high charged rock with dramatic shifts and up and down hill landscapes. Sting does it live on his tour now!  Wrapped Around Your Finger (which I didn't like the radio version, only the album version of 5:12) and its funky-meets-moody feel, and King of Pain's reflective but rocking and rumbling guitars playing.  But other songs on the album I like are Tea in the Sahara and Gradenko. Sting can write some of the most intelligent lyrics and it just fits in with the music.  This was really the Police at their highest creative peak--they couldn't get any higher than this, so they broke up quietly.  One of the '80s best albums!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I am pretty in the dark as far as music goes. I don't get MTV, so I have never seen any of Franz Ferdinand's music videos, nor heard all the hype they recieved over this summer. The way I found out about them was when my friend casually mentioned she was going to see them in concert. Since she has pretty good musical taste, I decided to check them out on the internet, and instantly fell in love with \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\". After hearing that song, and \\"Take me Out\\", I bought the CD, and am very happy I did so.           One reason my music collection is so small is that I find that I like one or two songs from a band's album, not enough for me to actually buy the CD. Franz Ferdidand is CD good from start to finish. The reason I gave it 4 stars though is because it is slightly weaker in the middle (even though those \\"weak\\" songs are better than the best songs on most other bands albums!) My favorite songs are of course, \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\", \\"Take me out\\", and \\"Darts of Pleasure\\", but the songs are all fun to listen and dance too!
B000002LFZ|5.0|I still say that Fleetwood Mac is one of the greatest pop groups of our time.  Their emphasis on songwriting, dramatic musical landscapes, and addictive pop and rhythm section are why I still like them. I still love Stevie Nicks singing the group's songs.  I still love Dreams,Rhiannon, Don't Stop, Tusk, Big Love, Everywhere, Little Lies, Gypsy and Sara (those last two sound so very alike, think about it).  I like their '88 song on here, As Long as You Follow, very country sounding, more like what Christine McVie is doing on her new solo album.  However, there are only two songs I don't and still don't like on here, the last two, Over My Head and No Questions Asked.  Those songs sound flat and bland to me; they just don't move me after all that great stuff that came before them. For anyone that hasn't heard them yet, get this album NOW!  Classic adult pop songs and gems on here!
B00027JYLC|5.0|Tod Browning, a former circus performer, displayed his vision when he directed Freaks in the early 30s, which was soon banned after its release in the United States.  The moral message of the film was apparently too much for the MPPA and The Catholic Legion of Decency in the 30s.  Freaks received cult status after it was banned and it was not allowed to be shown for decades.  However, Browning's Freaks received the honors it deserved when the National Film Registry decided to add it to it's archives in 1994.<br /><br />A small traveling circus has several performances by people with congenital birth defects of the most severe kind.  These men and women go through ruthless exploitation as people are attracted to these shows through their curiosity which is enhanced by imagination and tales.  One of these character's story is told as it surrounds a young prince of extremely short stature and a beautiful trapeze artist as they join in a treacherous love story.  This love story depicts the truth behind the truly grotesque as human behaviors and human appearances collide.<br /><br />Freaks is a brilliant film with a strong moral message, which should be pondered for as long as repugnant human behavior exists.  This means that Freaks has a timeless message that can measure up to any film made in our current society.  Ultimately, Freaks offers the audience an excellent cinematic event as the deformed characters chant, \\"we accept her...one of us\\".
B000002C4J|5.0|I still this that Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love was her most artistic and stylistic album to date.  She took more chances with stretching her voice on different songs.  I still like the funky Treat Her Like a Lady, where Celine really tears it up on a faster song!  It just got her off the ballad overkill a bit, the way Misled did on her '93 album. But I love songs like the P Diddy-beats-sounding Why oh Why, Immortality, the darker songs Miles To Go and Us, and To Love You More.  Tell Him with Barbara Streisand--true diva event as if there was one! Both singers sound beautiful on here. I like her I Hate You then I Love You with Pavarotti.  Her songs that Corey \\"I Wear My Sunglasses At Night\\" Hart produced are very good.  So I'll save this part for last--her \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is easily her best sung song of her career--the drama, emotion and range that she brings to it makes it one of the best '90s pop records.  While some people don't like it, you have to admit that it is a beautiful power ballad in the greatest sense. In conclusion, a very artistic and well done pop album from Celine with all that incredible talent involved on it.
068987474X|5.0|This book is FABULOUS ! To the point, kind, no-nonsense, intelligent, supportive, I loved it ! It will DEFINITELY help me next time someone is doing something I cannot figure out (am naiively hopeful about and afraid to rock the boat), because the bottom line is that if the guy is INTERESTED enough, I will KNOW it and not be worrying or trying to figure it out !  <br />Greg and Liz make sense on every single page, and address so many of the issues that men (or women) use as excuses to lead someone on.  <br />It doesn't matter if someone is playing head games with you anymore, this book strips away all the flirtatious or confusing signs and frees you to move forward to a guy who is going to be great for you !  <br />I wish I'd read it sooner, I would have been spared drooling over sonmone for a year who, despite what he said, just wasn't that into me ! <br />Many thanks to them for writing this masterful little book and sharing it with us !
1400032717|1.0|I hated this book. However, you may like it if you don't actually know much about autism and you've never lived with an autistic person. As someone who's done both, I find it nauseous becuase it's a growing trend of fictionalizing and heroizing what is a debilitating disease that as of yet has no cure. If you want to dismiss the seriousness of autism, read this book! It gives the protagonist waaaay more logic and order and an extraordinarily higher IQ than most autistic persons have. In essence, this is a \\"theory of autistics\\" fiction book, not an actual account and shouldn't be taken as anything more than a way for non-autistic people to pretend that they understand more than we do about the autistic world. The fact is the autistic world doesn't make sense, and they wouldn't be giving you these detailed explanations as if they're Plato or Aristotle or some other philosopher who's just rattling this off the top of their head. For those who choose to read it, remember this is fiction, not fact, and it was not written by someone who is autistic, and however much he knows, the fact is that autism is infinitely more incomprehensible, disturing, and debilitating that this book will let you know.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I dony wanna say much except that i cant wait for this dvd to come out.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is Arguebly NIN finest album when it comes to energy and anger......musically i think The Downward Spiral and The Fragile are better but this is more of a thrash album so if you think you will be getting tracks like Closer, Somewhat Damaged, look somewhere else anyways get this album it might take time to grow on you but its worth the wait
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I am disappointed that they took so long to make a sequel, but i was not disappointed.  Since i dont wanna spoil it for you ill just say it was great, maybe as good as the first one, which i am currently reviewing.  Anyways when availabel on DVD, make sure you buy them both.

B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost in Translation has to be one of the best low budget films ever made. Most people don't understand whats it about but if you look deeply into the film it doesn't have much of a plot line but it does have some deep and interesting characters. The movie is mostly about about the ups and downs of life and how people cope with them. If your looking for a comedy this is not one though it does have some funny scenes since Bill Murray is in it.

B00000099Y|5.0|SECRETARY: Nice rip-off of SomethingAwful. You fail at life. <br /> <br />Anyways, I have a good friend who is a Tool fan, so he let me borrow Aenima. I was glad to finally listen to something other than Undertow and an .mp3 of Schism I downloaded (I have dial-up, so mass downloading is impossible). After ripping it to my PC I had a good listen to it. It wasn't as good as I though it'd be. <br /> <br />However, like A Perfect Circle, Tool isn't something that you can absorb in one listen. You really start to appreciate it after you've heard it a couple times. But that's just me. Now Aenima is recieving a higher play count than Undertow in my music library. Hell, it's recieving a higher play count than anything. <br /> <br />I can't say you'll enjoy it, but you should at least give it a listen. I know I was glad I did.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|TROY WAS THE BEST MOVIE I SAW ALL SUMMER, and i watched some greats like all the star wars films that have already  been released, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings(all of em), Shrek(not really a classic, but still great), Alien and Aliens, Matrix `1,2,and Revolutions, Dune, and hundreds more, and i know as a fact that TROY WAS THE BEST OF THEM ALL(...)    My favorite scene is when Achilles takes the beach. I love how he slaughters all the poor trojan soldiers.  Then he cuts the statues head off! The characters are all great, (except for BLoom who plays a perverted sleeze ball rather well), and Achilles or I mean Brad Pitt who was so good as Achilles.  FOr all the losers who say he wasnt believeable as Achilles, screw you.  He was supposed to be a mindless killing machine that is awakened to the horrors of his life by the beautiful Brissius.  The SCORE IS AWESOME.  All the songs are great.  The only thing missing is a video game to honor this great movie.  Troy even earned a spot in MAD MAGAZINE in the September issue.(Why they waited so long who knows?????)    The Best Line is when Achilles says   \\"I chose nothing.  I was born, and this is what I am.\\"      Anyways, To get to the point, this is an unbelieveable movie, buy it, treasure it, watch it, memorise it, watch it again, and live forever!
B0001US8EO|5.0|Released around the same time as the movie, \\"Tombstone\\", this movie is unfairly compared and it is true that the sequences surrounding the gunfight at OK Corral are more enjoyable to watch in \\"Tombstone\\" (where we got to know the villians better and therefore got to hate them more, neccesary in a good action movie) <br /> <br />But \\"Wyatt Erp\\" is not an action movie. It is an epic, concentrating on a character study of what made this man the legend he became.  Costner does a superb job. (better, and with more depth than Kurt Russell, although Russell was also good, so this is a compliment to Costner, not a complaint about Russell) Dennis Quiad is as good as Val Kilmar in his portrayal of Doc Holiday but he is not featured as much as Kilmar was and does not have all the good lines Kilmar had, such as \\"I have two guns, one for each of you.\\" <br /> <br />I liked it. If I had not seen \\"Tombstone\\" first, I would have loved it and that is not fair to the producers so I am giving it a top rating.
B0002OOUP0|3.0|This disc is a reflection of the 2nd disc of \\"40 LICKS\\". The added tracks are the ones they should have had on in the first place. \\"Harlem Shuffle\\", \\"Waiting on a Friend\\", \\"Bitch\\" and \\"Rock & a Hard Place\\" were all top 20 placements but also nice tracks to listen & dance to. Of course \\"Hot Stuff\\" and \\"Respectable\\" were hits of an 'underground' nature - popular to the 'people' so to speak. <br />So that's it!  6 songs total here that were not on the \\"40 Licks\\" CD. But like it was mentioned in previous reviews here, this makes for a better all-round disc that the #2 disc of \\"40 Licks\\" had included.  I never could figure out when \\"40 Licks\\" came out why it did not include \\"Respectable\\" or \\"Bitch\\" (one of the Stones most popular tracks) or \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" or another of their most popular songs \\"Waiting on a Friend\\"? <br /> <br />So it should be 2 stars, but because of the compilation as a whole without comparison to any other, it could even get 4 stars.
B00000ILBK|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie because it went back to what Star Trek is all about: the characters <br />Yes, sure, it is in the 24th century, and there's action, but mainly \\"Star Trek\\" is so popular because it gives us a safe vision of the future. That's why I don't understand people complaining about it being too sweet, because it isn't. It has a hopeful, positive ending, and is, in a way, the opposite of \\"Nemesis\\"(which I, by the way, also liked). <br />Some basic ethnic questions were discussed in \\"Insurrection\\", the old philosophical part was back. None of the characters came too short. <br />The movie was overall well balanced, good story, great plotline, action, humor, romance, everything was incorporated. Nothing to complain about. <br />Maybe the joystick scene was a little exaggerated, but come on, it's science fiction! If you can beam people and create a warp core, why shouldn't you be able to fly a star ship with a joystick? <br />What the movie does NOT provide: <br />A senseless line of action scenes without real plot. <br />The humor wasn't wooden, I had several good laughs. <br />The dialogues weren't plump or sappy, I found them rather charming and intelligent.  <br />The story wasn't boring, what was happening to the Ba'Ku homeworld became a question of moral and ethics, going back to the \\"Star Trek\\" philosophy. <br />Wrong characterization: I haven't noticed anyone acting out of character, although the Ba'Ku juvenile effects have them act a little younger(cute and hilarious), it addresses the whole midlife crisis thing. And Worf wasn't any weirder than usually, he was just being Worf. <br /> <br />Deanna and Will finally got together, how sweet! I don't think it was too sudden, but about time! <br />Picard finally had a love story. <br />Geordi was able to see for a while.  <br /> <br />The use of music and imagery in the film was wonderful, beautiful landscape instead of grey star ship! <br />But don't worry, there's still enough action. <br /> <br />Summary: A beautiful and hopeful picture, true to the spirit of \\"Star Trek\\"! A great movie, not just for Trekkies, but for anyone to see! <br />
B0001DI5W6|1.0|Below average sci-fi schlock.  Despite decent special effects, I was bored to tears.  Silly plot, stale love scenes, no hot women, no car chases, etc., etc.  Unless the actors worked for free, they were vastly overpaid.  I just bought this movie for $5 and I feel ripped off.  In good conscience, I can't even recommend renting this p.o.s.

B000068TPN|4.0|From the duo that gave us \\"Braveheart\\", director Randall Wallace and actor Mel Gibson create a realistic and utterly graphic portrayal of the first firefight between American and Vietnames forces in 1965. This is NOT a movie for children or young teens due to its many scenes of the carnage of war.     Based upon the book by two participants of the battle, the movie opens in 1964 with Lt. Col. Harold Moore picking, training and molding his men who were to form the 7th Air Cavalry. It shares with \\"Blackhawk Down\\" the credo that no man is left behind and the concept that your unit is your family from \\"Band of Brothers\\".    This is one of the few war films that focuses upon the cost to the wives and families left behind. A nice touch is the parallel bonding done by the wives at home while the men are bonding during their training. Later the movie moves back and forth between the three day battle fought by the husbands and the insensitive telegram notification of their deaths (by Yellow Cab no less) to the wives.    As the emotional heart of the film, Barry Pepper is a standout as the UPI journalist who covers the battle and must bear witness to its cost in American lives (he later co-wrote the book with Lt. Gen. Moore). Mel Gibson (with a Southern accent) gives a fine performance as family man and commanding officer Moore. The supporting cast is excellent (esp. Greg Kinnear as the hotshot helicopter pilot, Sam Elliott as the Sgt. Major and Madelene Stowe as Mrs. Moore among others).    The battle scences are true to their time period (with Moore serving as the technical advisor to the film), the effective soundtrack altenates between Irish melodies & war drumming while the cinematography is rich. If you enjoyed \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or \\"Blackhawk Down\\", then you will enjoy this film as well.
0060527986|5.0|It made me stop and evaluate my life. It is not a long book, nor a novel. While it should be a fast read from the size of it, but it value comes from the amount of time you spend thinking about its content.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|History <br />So it's been ten years since the little indy film that could won the Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals.  Back then, no one knew who Kevin Smith was, and if someone were to utter the names \\"Jay and Silent Bob\\", they wouldn't have any meaning at all.  Back then, Smith was a comic-book-collecting convenience store worker with dreams of becoming a screenwriter (he had already written Dogma, but he decided to shelve it until he became a competant film maker).  He decided to make a movie about his job, the clerk at a local convenience store.  He cast his friends in the main roles, many of whom had never acted before, and, if this movie had never been made, probably never would have been in a movie (Jason Mewes was left of the promotional materials because ad execs thought he was too \\"strange-looking\\").  He paid for this movie with his credit cards and loans from friends.  It cost just under $27,000, and had it been any more expensive, it probably wouldn't have been made. <br />Plot <br />The \\"story\\" revolves around Dante Hicks (Brian o'Halloran), a clerk at a Quick Stop in New Jersey.  Dante is a slacker who, despite hating his career, won't do anything to improve his situation.  His best friend/worst enemy Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) works at the video store next to the Quick Stop and is an even bigger slacker than Dante.  Not only that, but where Dante is professional (most of the time) and a pushover, Randal lets no one take advantage of him, and he takes every opportunity to insult, degrade, offend, and embarass the customers of both stores.  Outside the stores reside drug dealing buddies Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), who scare away customers as well as pester the clerks.  Finally, the two women in Dante's life round out the cast.  There is his girlfriend Veronica Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) who is a very committed girl with some \\"dirty laundry\\" that Dante has trouble accepting.  Then, there is his old flame Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer).  When they were dating, she cheated on him 8.5 times (Dante explains the half time to Randal), yet he can't get her out of his system.  As the day goes on, many surreal, bizzare, and downright hilarious events occur, such as the gum rep who pretends to be a normal customer, the hockey game on the roof, the \\"shell-shocked\\" guidance counselor, a botched funeral, and the sale of tobacco to a four-year-old girl.  And the best part is, this was supposed to be Dante's day off! <br />Acting <br />This is definitely the movie's weakest point.  As I said earlier, many of these people had never acted before, and it is apparent.  Many times, it seems that the actors aren't interacting, they are merely reciting their lines.  As distracting as this can be, it doesn't affect the movie too terribly. <br />Extras <br />On this 10th Anniversary edition, we are treated to more extra material than we know what to do with.  There are two cuts of the film, the theatrical cut and the director's cut.  As of writing this review, I have only watched the theatrical cut, but I did watch the end of the director's cut in order to see the extended ending.  Let me say two things about the extended cut: 1. The video and audio are far inferior to the normal cut.  2. I'm glad Kevin Smith decided not to use the extended ending of the film.  While it did provide a good deal of irony, it was extremely depressing and it wasn't done very well either.  Another extra is the \\"lost scence\\" that took place within the funeral home.  There is an intro by Smith and Scott Mosier (the producer) explaining why it was cut.  The scene is animated, in the style of the Clerks cartoon, and it does get some laughs.  Not only that, but it introduces Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a character who is only alluded to in this movie (she is introduced in Chasing Amy).  However, I think that Kevin Smith was right when he said that, maybe things were better left to our imagination. <br />Conclusion <br />This is a very funny movie from a writer/director/actor whose early work is somewhat underappreciated.  Although, from what I've heard, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma are the best films he's made, while Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Jersey Girl were all so-so or bad.  Smith is obviously a competent writer.  This film is definitely worth a look if you've never seen it before.  Be warned however; there is almost non-stop profanity and sexual allusions.
B0002I831S|5.0|Rather than repeating the accolades already given, I want to praise Paramount for not cutting corners on the packaging! The discs are mounted in a series of plastic holders bound together like the pages in a book. Then, this \\"album\\" is contained in the yellow hard plastic shell that is hinged at the top. A durable set-up that is light years ahead of the cardboard packaging used on other sets that is so easily damaged. Also, I would estimate that all three seasons combined will take less than 1/4 the space of the previous series released in two-episode keep cases. Good job Paramount!
B00005K9LM|4.0|Defender's of the Faith is one of Judas Priest's later albums. Personally, I really dig this album since it does not let down for an instant. Yet therein lies the problem; this is a good cd by all means, but it does contain any moment on this cd that is truly execptional. Screaming for Vengeance had songs that made it stand out. But this one does not really distinguish itself. Yet, that is the only real problem I have with Defenders of the Faith. It still has all the things that make Priest a great band. None of the songs are mindblowing, but they are still great. Check out Freewheel Burning and Love Bites. Those are pretty awesome. For classic heavy metal, look no further than this album. Hopefully, you will enjoy it.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Anchor Bay have outdone themselves with this one.  This has to be the most complete package they've ever assembled.  It's only for the hardcore Romero fan though, so I'd stick with the theatrical dvd that came out a few months back if you're just a casual fan.  4 discs on this baby:  The first one is the theatrical version we've all seen many times.  The second is the extended version which some of us have seen.  It's about 10+ minutes longer and includes some extra dialogue, extra gore, more biker footage and more shopping footage and newsroom footage as well.  It also has a scene that explains how the \\"Have you got any cigarettes?\\" cop appears out of nowhere.  Disc 3 is Dario Argento's European cut.  This is interesting.  It runs about ten minutes shorter than the theatrical version  yet contains snippets-usually a few seconds-of footage not seen in either the theatrical or extended versions!  You're probably asking why bother including a third disc?  Why not take the \\"new\\" footage from Argento's version and put it in the Extended version to make one long cut of the film?  Well, in Argento's version, there are some snippets removed from the film as well.  This kinda takes from the humor and character development, but Argento's interested in pacing here.  He edits these scenes and rearranges the music on the soundtrack so the \\"action\\" music plays in totally different scenes, making the movie move at a totally different pace.  In fact, the first half hour just zooms by in this version.  They're at the mall 30 minutes into it which isn't the case with the other versions.  It slows down when necessary, but Argento keeps the movie going.  In fact, he edits it so it looks like a Dario Argento film.  Whether you love his version or hate it is up to your personal taste.  It's not better or worse, just different.  A huge hit in Europe as well.  Disc 4 is the extra goodies.  It has a retrospective 75 minute documentary that talks to all the stars in front and behind the camera.  Very cool.  It also has Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead, a hour and a half documentary made while Romero was filming Dawn.  I saw this years ago and it's very fun to watch.  There's also a tour of the mall with Ken Foree and other cast memebers, as well as other documentary footage.  All four discs come with the trailers and still galleries as you'd expect.  The first three discs all have commentaries by different people.  Basically this set will keep you busy for awhile.  If you're a huge fan of this film, I'm sure you know this set is out now, and I can tell you that it's worth every penny, so snatch it as soon as you can.  Fantastic movie(all 3).  There's only one Dawn Of The Dead.....You hear that Zack Snyder???  Only one!!!era.  Very cool.

0553573403|4.0|George R. R. Martin's first book in his A Song of Ice and Fire saga is a deep and complex book, with many different criss crossing plotlines that are all woven together into one story. Each chapter focuses on a member of the Stark family, being either Eddard, Catelyn, Jon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, and the one non- Stark Tyrion Lannister. If I told you anything anything about the story, I would probably end up giving away one of several plot twists. I can tell you, that Mr. Martin is not afraid to have evil conquer good, which happens several times. Also, there is no shortage of gore, and although this is not as evident in the earlier chapters, once you hit about page 450, Martin suddenly ups the ante in terms of gruesomeness[ one character has a wolf jump through their stomach]. Also, there is strong language and adult situations to be heard throughout the book, and there is some sex. Some reviewers critizice that the book has too much sex and violence, but if you can't take the violence, then just don't read the book.

B0002TT0NW|5.0|The first Harry Potter movie undoutably moved fast enough, but incorporated too much childish slapstick. <br /> <br />The second toned down on overall slapstick, but the reamining comedic endevours were over-the-top, and it moved unbearably slow. <br /> <br />The third installment of the series, has evolved from a movie to a film. Bogus physical comedy is toned down to an absolute minimum and it moves quickly. The new director far outweighs Christopher Columbus in storytelling and cinematography overall, because \\"Scary Imagery\\" is actually \\"Scary Imagery\\". <br /> <br />I'm getting sick and tired of artisctly ignorant people complaining about the fact that the movie doesn't stick true to the book. Film and Book are two totally different art forms. Storytelling is told through pictures, and not words, and thusly event sequences and cuts have to be different. And yes, while certain parts from the books are left out,  the movie makers have no choice, because a movie has to be quick, and to-the-point, while books can drag out as long as they please. Someone griped that one-third of the book was about the magical broomstick, but please. Who would honestly sit through a 50 minute expos on a broomstick? <br /> <br />Overall, the directing was superb--in this movie you will find yourself clinging to your date's hand ever now and then--the acting has evolved into something worthy of praise, the overall atmosphere has changed as the characters become young adults, and the score is absolutely beautiful. Once you get over the fact that this isn't a seven-hour Lord of the Rings type sypnosis of a 435 page book, and accept the art-form that it is, you will enjoy this film, and most likely purchase it.
0195067142|5.0|This is probably one of the most realistic works I have read.  It is a absolute must for anyone attempting to understand the Pacific Campaign, what our men went through and what they did for us.  I have read this one twice and plan a third reading soon.  This is the sort of history they should be teaching in our schools rather than some of the meaningless stuff now presented.  This is certainly one work you can get your teeth into.  Highly recommend you add it your your collection! Thank you Mr. Sledge.
1594200106|3.0|I've read the Spanish edition. I can tell you it's been a runaway success; most people I have talked to liked it. But I didn't. It's well written, and the characters are well described and likable, but, at the end of the day, it is a Gothic soap opera. Lots of unknown relations, ghoulish cops, disfigured good guys, mansions in the darkness during a hailstorm... 3/4 into the novel, you expect everybody to have been married and/or in love and/or be the second removed cousin of everybody else.<br />The first half of the novel is the best, it hints to a Gothic-soap spoof; but, in the second half, it fully falls into being a Gothic soap.<br />This novel owes a lot to \\"City of prodigies\\", by Eduardo Mendoza, which is far better.
B000006NPY|4.0|\\"Twilight fades/through blistered Avalon,\\" is the ethereally dismal line that opens \\"Adore\\"'s first song, and sets the mood for the Smashing Pumpkins' quietest album, with the hard-rock guitars and percussion giving way to a gentler sound and some swippy electronica. It's not what you expect from the Pumpkins, but it's still enticing.<br /><br />It opens with the lullaby-like \\"To Sheila,\\" a shimmering little composition. Then Corgan stretches his music to include some symphonic, raw electronica in \\"Ava Adore,\\" the fast \\"Appels + Oranjes,\\" and the darkly shimmering \\"Daphne Descends.\\" The saddening \\"Once Upon A Time\\" even sounds whimsical if you don't listen to the words, with that light melody and those bells.<br /><br />Don't worry, the Pumpkins sound is retained in songs like the guitar-driven \\"Perfect,\\" the hollow-sounding \\"Tear,\\" and the balladic \\"Crestfallen.\\" The second half sounds a little more acoustic and less electronic, with some lingering piano kicking off some of the songs. But lurking in the back is a hint of electronica that seeps in from time to time. One example is the haunting sounds at the back of \\"For Martha,\\" a wrenching tribute to Corgan's late mother.<br /><br />\\"Adore\\" is one of the most controversial Smashing Pumpkins albums -- rather than merely sticking to what he had already done, Corgan experimented with electronic music and melded it in. But the core of the music is the same -- pain and anger from the losses of life, the struggle with one's emotions, and finally letting go of that pain and anger.<br /><br />Don't expect the Chemical Brothers in here -- Corgan's take on electronic music is dark, melancholy, almost gothic at times. Corgan's hard techno has its painful angles and corners, but in songs like \\"Crestfallen,\\" he lets the smooth melody be carried off by sweeps of trip-hop. It adds a velvety sound to Corgan's already exceptional music.<br /><br />It's saddening that the excellent Jimmy Chamberlin was not involved in \\"Adore,\\" instead of the electric drumbeats. The guitar is still there, but it's a cloaked presence in most songs. Corgan's high voice is softened by the low-key songs he sings here. And his songwriting remains exceptional, vivid and emotional, like a poem set to music: \\"I can't go on, digging roses from you grave/to linger on, beyond the beyond/where the willows weep/ and whirlpools sleep, you'll find me...\\"<br /><br />\\"Adore\\" is a dark, moody work that took quite some time to be fully appreciated by many fans.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|It's an awesome soundtrack! It has all the great composition music from the movie! I like the ending credits music best.
B0001HAISG|4.0|Ultimately, PJ Hogan's Peter Pan is a success. <br /> <br />There is one patch about half an hour in, shortly after the arrival in Neverland, when the film is not quite happy with itself: It becomes far too cute and saccharine for its own good; the makers can't seem to make up their mind whether they're pitching for a jolly fun, old-fashioned entertainment or a run-of-the-mill kiddies' blockbuster; but thankfully, things improve, and the film moves at a suitable pace towards a thrilling climax. <br /> <br />Jason Isaacs is in excellent form as both Mr Darling and the dastardly Captain Hook, and I also enjoyed British comedy stalwart Richard Briers as Smee. As Peter, Jeremy Sumpter has the facial features to be cheekily good-looking without becoming too cutesy, and his performance strikes a nice balance between charm and stubbornness. <br /> <br />The special effects belong to the eighties -- I got the impression they threw away the budget on the crocodile and only later remembered they had other setpieces to fund -- but the whole thing is generally good fun, with enjoyable characterizations and a delightfully old-fashioned feel, even if it sometimes comes across as a little twee. <br /> <br />The poignancy with which the themes of childhood and growing up are dealt with gives it the edge over other versions I have seen, including Disney's memorable 1953 animation.
B00005J6UP|5.0|WHOOOOOOOOO! This movie ROCKS! It's about this group of kids who go looking for treasure to pay off real estate agents who want to tear down their homes. They go on a wild and crazy adventure, and try to avoid a family of fugitives who know that they've seen too much! Great movie. I love Sloth!!!! :-D
B0002I831S|4.0|I was lucky.  I picked up Star Trek: TOS DVD Collection for 79.99 during a two day sale at a local computer store.  I mention this because I don't know if I would have purchased it as I own all the videos of the series, but the DVD format was too much of a lure and the price was right. <br /> <br />The transfer is perfect.  Almost too perfect as sometimes the edges of the Spock's ears can be seen for the first time! Overall, we have the complete collection of the first season of the acclaimed Star Trek series.  Sound and visuals are stunning.  The packaging unique (or at least never been tried).  For the price I paid I am a very happy trekker.   <br /> <br />However, there a few niggly points that would have made me very unhappy had I paid the over $100+ price tag I have seen in retail stores and prevented me from scoring a perfect 5 stars in the Amazon universe.  I list them here in some small hope that someone at Paramount could somehow correct these issues in the next two season collections to come. <br /> <br />1.  While the packaging was wonderful, I could have done without the paper sleeve that I must each time reinsert over the main DVD holder.  In time I forsee the sleeve tearing anyways.  Get rid of it or give us a protective cover that folds over like the rest of the disc holders. <br /> <br />2.  The videos had the foresight to be released in order of production.  The previous DVD collection followed this tradition.  So, why, oh why, is this collection in order of air dates?  I would rather (and I suspect the majority of us) would rather view the shows in order of production so the true evolution of the series can be seen.  To see costumes change back and forth, Dr. McCoy appear and disappear and reappear again, and Spock being demure and then smiling and shouting and back to demure is bit unsettling.  Also, no where is there production information printed on the disc or in the nifty summary booklet.  I have to put the first DVD in and look at the order and then put each one in to find the next one and back again. At least, put the production number and the airing date in the booklet and on the DVD for viewers to find easily. <br /> <br />3.  Menu Selection:  They almost got this one right.  The mainview screen shows the four episodes.  You click on the title to be taken to a detailed selection menu at the helmsman station.  Okay, I am fine with that. However, let's make this easier for those who just want to get straight to the action.  On the main screen give an option next to the each title to PLAY ALL.  Play right through whole episode, preview and end titles. Simple.  Click on the title for those who wish more choices. <br /> <br />4. Track Selection: If you click to the next track to avoid the opening titles, you are taken several minutes into the show.  The track selections should be at every commerical break.  Track 1 - Prologue, Opening Title.  Track 2 - Act 1, etc. <br /> <br />As I have mentioned, for the price I have paid this product delivers in a grand way, but I would have been in Rigel's Pleasure Planet had the episodes been in production order.  I could have lived with the rest of my nitpicks quite easily, but they just added to my annoyance when watching the shows.  So close, yet so far.  Still, the quality of picture and sound is top notch and so this compliation is a must buy for any Trek fan who doesn't already own the DVD collections. <br />
0767819659|2.0|I like the cartoons and books better than this. sorry.
B000002L5I|5.0|Kenny Wayne's Trouble Is is an aceptionally good album with alot of great blues/rock material. Their are alot of good songs no fill in's in my book! I have read alot of other reviwers on this album complaining \\"He's A Copy Of Stevie Ray Vaughan\\" that really pisses me off because this kid is giving his all in his style\\" he is by no means a copy. Does He Sound Like Stevie Ray Vaughan? Yes, but in his own style (in a good way). I really enjoyed True Lies, which has a sweet texian riff that you just cant beat. I also love his version of Jimi Hendrix's I Dont Live Today, wow a great performence for the king! If you want some acoustic songs their is a great acoustic song titled Blue On Black a really edgy track with alot of potenial. Otherwise the music their is defiently no TROUBLE with this album at all. I really have to put my hands down for this one! Please buy this album if you want great blues, great rock, great guitarist. WOW!
B000069HK2|5.0|this is such a amazing cd. the band actually wrote this cd in like two weeks and imagine if they took like half a year like alot of bands do it would be the most amazing thing ever. i have heard songs off the new cd and its like what it was before it was written in two weeks and its just as kick ass.
B00002E23E|5.0|This is one of Led Zeppelin's biggest concerts recorded at Madison Square Garden 1973. This DVD takes you through a great concert, showing group memebers at home, and in fantasy settings. Robert Plant really was at the top with his powerful raw vocals as well as Jimmy Page's guitar solo's that just rocked. Bonham's moby dick is just incrediable, and John Paul John's keyboard, and bass playing is smoothe. Their are so many classic tunes on \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" including Rock N Roll, Black Dog, Since I've Been Loving You, No Quarter, The Song Remains The Same, Dazed And Confused, Stairway To Heaven, Mody Dick, Heartbreaker, and Whole Lotta Love. This is a must have for the MUSIC FAN!! Highly Recomended!!

B0000A02U2|5.0|National Lampoon's Animal House is one of the most popular movies in the history of comedy. This Double Secret probation edition includes many bonus material like the Where Are They Now?- A hilarious all-new mockumentary featuring the orginal cast, Did You Know That? A universal animated anecdotes about the orginal production of the film, and The Yearbook: An animal house reuion. This double secret probation edition just rocks I love all of the bonus material. The funnist part of the movie is when Otis Redding do the rendition of SHOUT! John Belushi was \\"brillant\\" at being a comedian on screen, so was Tim Matheson. This entire movie based on the 1960s college partying life is real funny.

And their is a hot new music video titled Shout. Anyone will laugh their ass of with this new double secret probation full screen edition on DVD. Laugh Now!
0345440900|5.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about for some very negative reviews below.  Like any book on parenting or childcare, you can discriminate and pick and choose the advice that is best for you.  I found Ms. Hogg's advice to be compassionate, loving and respectful toward infants.  The most important advice I gleaned was to watch out for the cues an infant sends for what he or she needs and being very responsive to those cues.  For a new breastfeeding mother, I was all too often responding to cries as hunger cries.  When I was finally able to interpret cranky (sleepy) cries, boredom (change of scenery needed) cries, etc., I had a much happier baby on my hands, a stark difference from the colicky baby in the first few weeks.  I feel I am responding to her needs better than ever.  In addition, I realized that putting her into her crib at a pre-determined bedtime to go to sleep was not being neglectful but was creating positive lifetime sleeping habits in addition to being a \\"whole family solution.\\" A family is a system...what's good for you is good for baby!  That being said, if she cries because she needs me, I will nurse her, I will take her into bed with us, I will sacrifice sleep and rest, but honestly because her needs are being met more accurately and life is more predictable to her, she is happier and this rarely (if ever) happens.  I highly recommend this book.
B00028HBL6|5.0|I thought I knew the story of Jesus, having been raised very strictly in the Bible belt. After viewing this film, I find myself woefully ignorant (or at least without imagination for tortures used in the past). I was moved to tears (as well as nausea) throughout the film. Kudos to Mr Gibson. This is the film of our generation.
0321213351|5.0|i just finnished reading this book and i was very suprised about the simplicity and especially everything i could read between the lines. it's very funny if you recognize yourself inside his stories about real world anti patterns. (yes, i'm pattern happy ;D) i liked it more than fowler's book, which was to basic, as i read many research papers before, anyway both are nice to have. i look in this book before taking design decisions,as a brainstorming partner if i develop alone. excellent work, buy it right now!
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of the Christ is controversial because the person it  depicts is the most controversial person in the history of the world.   <br /> <br />One cannot accuse the movie of being anti-semitic without accusing the gospels for the same.  The movie is true to the gospel account of the passion of Jesus. <br /> <br />Yes it is bloody and some may not like the blood and violence in the movie.  But as  Monica Bellucci (acting as Mary Magdelene) said, 'it is a violent film against violence.' <br /> <br />Owning this movie is like owning a copy of the Bible.  I bet it is going to be a part of every Christian video collection. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson had undertaken the most daring project in Hollywood history.  The film was written off by the media from the very beginning.  Mel put in $25 million of his own money into a film he deeply believed in. <br /> <br />Once again the doom's day prophets of the media were wrong when they said that no one would want to buy the video.  On the very first day of it's release on 1st Sept. 2004 it sold 4.1 million copies and hit no. 1 on the amazon.com sales list. <br /> <br />I recommend strongly with this movie 'Jesus of Nazareth' by Franco Zeffirelli (ASIN: B0000633QW).  Originally made for TV in 1977, this in-depth (six hours plus) version of Jesus' life is thorough. It accurately protrays the life of Christ from the gospels right from his birth to the crucifixion and his resurrection.   <br /> <br />For reading besides the Gospel account from the Bible, I would recommend 'Life of Christ' by Fulton Sheen. It is a literary masterpiece.  It will unravel the mysteries behind every event of the gospel in a way that has never been done before.
B00023BLXK|1.0|It's a really bad movie. The action takes place in the 50's but the music is from the present times. The whole movie looks like a video clip from Santana or Ricky Martin. It's a poor copy of the original Dirty Dancing - follows the same pattern : they meet, dance together, and have a spectacular final dance.  <br />  From this movie it looks like the people from Havana danced everyday, everywhere and didn't mind that there was a revolution taking place. <br />  Boring, boring, boring. <br />
B0000025P9|5.0|Toto, Survivor, Night Ranger, those were the <br />top melodic rock bands of our time.  And <br />these members have regrouped.  Also <br />check out Mecca----new cd, which <br />has one Toto's members and Survivor's  <br />contributing.  Awesome!
0767903862|5.0|Having traveled through many countries, including Australia, as a journalist, photographer, explorer and teacher, I can honestly say that I have simply never enjoyed a travel book so much. <br /> <br />Bryson pulls you in from the very first page. He explains that Australia is a country so vast that in 1967, they lost their Prime Minister, Harold Holt. \\"I mean, come on!\\" He plunged into the surf in Victoria and simply vanished.  <br /> <br />Bryson talks about the various ways you can bite it in Australia, including being bitten by poisonous snakes and of course, sharks and crocodiles. Then there are the boxer jellyfish. Bryson explains that one young man was stung by such a creature and even while unconscious and sedated with morphine he was screaming in agony. <br /> <br />Bryson's trek on the luxury train across The Outback was filled with humor. He speaks of notes that he'd scrawled on the back of coasters for later use; \\"G attacked by camel in lav. Alice Springs, 1947. Great!\\" <br /> <br />Australia only has 18 million citizens and China increases in size every year more than that. (Despite the one child policy, forced abortion and slave labor laogai gulags to make our Christmas toys - perhaps the subject of Bryson's next book?) Australia is the world's sixth largest country, the only continent that is a country, the world's largest island and the only nation that began as a prison. Australia, Bryson explains, spends US$ 7.3 billion every year on gambling. The Simpson Desert, which covers an area of 100,000 square miles, didn't even receive its name until 1932. <br /> <br />And I bet you didn't know that Sydney was originally supposed to be called \\"Albion.\\"  <br /> <br />Can you imagine hearing them say;  \\"Welcome to the Albion Olympics?\\" <br /> <br />Mr. Bryson's work is peppered with clever terms like \\"rent with\\" and \\"want hanging,\\" and \\"you'll be apples\\" which are unusual and demonstrate his true gift as a writer. (I prefer the British term \\"trolleyed\\" meaning \\"being very drunk\\" as my own personal favorite, though this term didn't make the cut in Bryson's book.)  <br /> <br />His notation on the probability that Japan's Aum Shin Rikyo doomsday cult may have set off the world's first non-governmental nuclear bomb in the Australian Outback back in 1993 was the stuff of pure journalism. (This was reported in the New York Times. As an aside, I myself published a well-received article on Aum Shin Rikyo for WND.com several years ago. However, like most people, I was shocked to learn about the Aum-A bomb connection.) <br /> <br />Yet Bryson's talents as a researcher cannot be confined to any single genre. He is also a true fan of history it seems. (I am as well and this is what makes In a Sunburned Country such a treat for any reader who shares that love of history.)  <br /> <br />For example, Bryson tells the reader that back in 1931, that a proto-ant called \\"Nothomyrmecia\\" which lived over 100 million years ago, was \\"(re)-discovered\\" in the nether reaches of Australia.  <br /> <br />His review of Burke and Wills famous trek across Australia, as well as Captain Cook's expedition (which was featured in an old but very brilliant National Geographic article which it appears Bryson studied) are nothing short of masterful. <br /> <br />There are other delicious nuggets sprinkled in the book along the way.  <br /> <br />In 1935, a 14-foot shark was captured and placed in an aquarium in the town of Coogee, north of Sydney. After two days the shark vomited up Jimmy Smith's arm. Jimmy, standing there at the aquarium, may well had gotten the second greatest fright of his life. <br /> <br />In 1938 at Bondi Beach, four giant, rouge waves swept in out of the blue and carried off 200 people out to sea. The waves were 25 feet high. Fortunately, Bryson explains, 50 lifeguards were on hand and saved 194 people. Only six perished. (Today scientists have begun studying rouge waves in earnest.)  <br /> <br />Bryson introduces the reader to mariners like Luis Vaez de Torres and Abel Tasman who played key roles in Australia's discovery, or near discovery through the years. <br /> <br />According to Bryson, Joseph Banks, who sailed with Captain Cook, collected so many specimens of plants that the National Museum of History in London is still busy cataloging them. (They need to hire a few interns!) <br /> <br />Bryson's finest moments as a historian and humorist come when describing the early prison colonization of Australia. One of the prisoners sent to Australia was charged with stealing 12 cucumber plants. Another man had stolen a book called \\"A summary account of the Flourishing State of Tobago.\\" Those were rough times in England, Bryson tells us. A person could be hung for over 200 offenses including \\"impersonating an Egyptian.\\"  <br /> <br />In a hilarious recounting, Bryson recreates the encounter Captain Arthur Phillip, who led the colonization at Botany Bay in 1787, had with a French mariner, Count Jean-Francois de la Perouse. Perouse had sailed into Australia on the very heels of Phillip and his party. When they met, Phillip had to explain to Perouse that he'd just sailed 15,000 miles to build a prison for people who \\"had stolen lace ribbons, some cucumber plants and a book on Tobago.\\" <br /> <br />Says Bryson, the look on the Frenchman's face, \\"must have been one of the great looks in history.\\" The Frenchman sailed away as a good sport, unable to \\"save Australia from 200 years of English cooking\\" and later sank and drowned off of New Hebrides.  <br /> <br />You just don't recover from a loss like that.  <br /> <br />Bryson also visits interesting towns like Broken Hill, which may lead the reader to conjure images of Mel Gibson riding around The Outback in a dune buggy wearing ice hockey pads on the outside of his clothes, sporting a Geiger Counter and wrestling with \\"Master Blaster\\" in a cage which Tina Turner looks on with the aplomb of a queen tossing aside a drumstick at a Thanksgiving feast. <br /> <br />If you love traveling and or Australia, I cannot recommend In A Sunburned Country highly enough. This terrific book has made this writer want to travel back to Australia and pick up where Bryson left off.
B00029NMRM|1.0|The first movie (...Nine Yards) was entertaining.  This one is - or should be - an embarrassment to everyone involved in its production.  They should have called it \\"One More Yard\\", since it is about 1/10 as good as the first one.  When the actors are interviewed in the future, this should be the answer to the question \\"What is the worst movie you ever made?\\". With all due respect, I have to believe that anyone who writes a positive review of this movie is either not sober, or stands to make money from it in some way.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Although it had been clearly posted on WB's website for some time, neither 3 or 4 contain extended versions. Therefore, you are paying for something you likely already own. All you get here is packaging and an extra disk of extras. No, thank you.<br /><br />I haven't spoken to a single person who didn't want these films to contain more, and we know more exist. So WB screwed up royally.<br /><br />As for the film, it's one of the best of the series, not because it's faithful to the book (it's not) but because it works as a film, because it's the best acting to date, because the pacing works, and because the look fits the mood. Unfortunately if you haven't read the book you will fall into sever plot-holes, though the film over-all is gratifying, if you don't know the book you might be left wondering about several things when you leave the theater.<br /><br />Great film, but buy the standard dvd/blu-ray, this version is just WB cash-in.
B000268QB2|5.0|I saw their video on vh1 for \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and i bought them the next day at Best Buy. i loved this album from the very beginning. they're sort of a poor man's coldplay, but i think i like them even better ! my favorite tracks - Somewhere Only We Know, Bend and Break, We Might as Well Be Strangers, and Bedshaped. you gotta pick these guys up
B00005JMUA|5.0|Most people interested in this product have seen Kill Bill 1- that said, if you didn't have questions at the end of the first movie, then this will simply be for the enjoyment of watching Uma Thurman \\"Kill Bill.\\" However, if you did have questions, this will pretty much answer anything... including her real name... small detail, but much much more is explained...
B000089RVX|5.0|I just recently discovered Evanescence by mistake after visiting a friend's web site and clicking a link for Evanescence - Hello. I absolutely LOVED the track and, having friends who were obsessed with the album and the band, naturally decided to borrow/buy the album. A friend lent it to me, and here I am, listening, several days after becoming obsessed with it myself. I just cannot stop listening to it... Amy Lee's voice is so much more polished and mature than anyone else in her age group of singers, such as Avril Lavigne, Brittany Spears, etc. It's like an angel from heaven has come down to bless us with her talent, and it's no wonder why the song &amp;amp;quot;Bring Me To Life&amp;amp;quot; attracted so many fans to this small Arkansas band and singer! And, without further ado, onto the ratings...      Going Under - This song is not my favorite, but nonetheless, it is a great song. The rock beat really strikes my fancy, and the lyrics are well-polished. 9.5/10      Bring Me To Life - The song that inspired Evanescence's fan base, and it's really easy to see why! The lyrics are great, the tune is wonderful, and it's really easy to pick up. It's haunting and rocking at the same time, and overall a great song. It has its shortcomings, however, as it will become really repetetive after a while of listening to it because it is so awesome! 9.5/10      Everybody's Fool - A great song, but it's basically repeating the same thing, merely in different words, through the entire song. 9.5/10      My Immortal - After listening to all of the album and Hello before it, this was my new favorite song. As another reviewer put it, it may be what heaven really sounds like. This is one of the band's songs that you hear everywhere, like Avril Lavigne's Sk8er Boi, and you just instantly love it, but you just never know who the artist is... then you find out, get the album, listen to the song and the rest of it, and become obsessesed instantaneously! Its haunting lyrics and beautiful piano make this an instant classic, not to be missed. 10/10      Haunted - Amy Lee sang the heck out of this one, and because of it, it's great. It's not quite at bloody as Tourniquet, but creepy all the same, and in this reviewer's eyes, creepy = good. 9/10      Touniquet- This song really makes you brood over death. Amy really convinces you that she's in serious pain when she sings so soulfully, and it makes you so sorry for her, that you just can't help but like the song. However, I'm not really one for the morbid-type, so marks down for the gruesome details. Don't get me wrong though; this song is still great. 9/10      Imaginary - Amy describes how she retreats into her own world to escape the horrors of this one, but she can't decide which one she likes better. Very soulful, just like all of the other songs on the album. 9/10      Taking Over Me - It seems like Amy is willing to drop everything and find her true love, who has taken over her soul and now is morunful for him because he left. The lyrics are great, and the entire song has a very catchy beat. 9.5/10      Hello - This is the song that got me hooked on Evanescence. Haunting and beautiful lyrics, Amy's beautiful voice that will keep you awake (and slightly insane because of sadness and other factors) for weeks to come, and absolutely haunting melody on the piano, this is my personal favorite song on this album. It maintains the sad note of Haunted and Tourniquet, but with much less violence. She doesn't know if she's sleeping or not, and then she realizes that death really does exist, and that nothing will ever be the same. Let me scream for a moment: I LOVE THIS SONG!! 10/10      My Last Breath - When I listened to this, the first time, I got the lyrics stuck in my head because Amy sung them so beautifully! The beat is catchy and fun, and the lyrics are great. Overall, a great song. 9.5/10      Whisper - This song is probably the worst one on the CD, though don't get me wrong; I still love it, but itjust isn't up to par with the others. I do, however, love the Latin at the end; Amy translated it roughly to &amp;amp;quot;Save us from danger, save us from evil,&amp;amp;quot; and it really fits the mood of the song. It gets pretty slow at the end, so that turned me off of it a little bit. Still a good song nonetheless.      Overall, this album is one of the most polished I've ever heard in years, and it really got me hooked on the goth/rocky genre. I simply can't wait for the next one! Keep up the good work guys!
B000002H33|5.0|Reccomended for any Thrash metal fan, or music fan in general. Must have in any collection. From Battery to Damage, Inc., pure musical genious and their last work with the legendary Cliff Burton. Don't hesitate and buy this now!
B000001FS6|5.0|Why this album is not classed as one of U2's best is beyond me. <br />It contains a combination of both live and studio numbers, some great covers and some of the strongest U2 tracks ever written. <br /> <br />The powerful opening track of The Beatles' cover Helter Skelter proves just how exciting U2 are as a live band as do all their live tracks on the record. - It's best cranked up on your stereo and more enjoyable than the original version (and that's saying something coming from a Beatles fan!) <br />At best, it is a rock album - Desire (a number one single) fast, sharp and has stood the test of time. Angel Of Harlem, is fun and upbeat and When Love Comes To Town sees the group team up with the legendary B.B. King.  This is U2 discovering American blues music and their own interpretation is nothing short of impressive.  <br />Of the slower tracks, U2 don't get any better - Love Rescue Me, All I Want Is You and in particular, Heartland are as good as any of their biggest hits of their career. <br />Other notable tracks include the slow-building Hawkmoon 269 (my favourite) and God Part II - powerful lyrics with an equally powerful performance. <br /> <br />Rattle and Hum proves why U2 are the ultimate rock band. <br />Turn it up and enjoy it!   <br />
B00003CXCT|3.0|Here's what will happen.  After these \\"Special Editions\\" have been sold and later a box with all 6 sells it run, Lucas will have no choice but to issue the originals in order to keep milking the cow.  I do have a question.  At the end of Jedi Luke removes Vader's mask to see his father for the 1st time.  But Lucas will now remove that actors face & replace it with the new guy.  So now Luke will see Ben, Yoda and \\"who's that guy?  Where's my Dad?\\"  How will Luke KNOW thats his father when he was young?
B00004RFFI|2.0|I think I was so disappointed in this movie precisely because I was SO looking forward to it when it first came out! I love movies and documentaries about tornadoes, but they really screwed this up bad.       First, the storyline was idiotic. The bad guys drove around in big black trucks and hunted tornadoes for a \\"corporation\\" (gasp! heavens!) The colorful young assistants I wouldn't trust to change engine oil, let alone be the ones to warn people of impending danger. Then the psychology was all wrong. One of the reasons Jaws worked was because the hero was terrified of water and sharks. Hunt is all over the place; sometimes she's scared, other times she acts like she's at a water theme park (\\"that was fun! let's do it again!\\") Meanwhile, Bill's poor fiance spends the whole movie gasping in horror. SHE should have been the naive girl who thought tornadoes would be fun, until she came up upon the really bad one at the drive-in... and then she could understand where Hunt's fear/obsession came from. Unfortunately, the writers didn't get that, or (more likely) they didn't really care.       Second, the special effects stunk. Sorry, but when they say a tornado makes a roaring sound, they mean it roars like a train - not a dinsoaur. The most effective scene is the one at the drive-in, and that's because you don't see the tornado - like the opening scene of Jaws where all you see is the terror of the girl swimmer, as opposed to the fake shark opening and closing its mouth later on.      It is fun, however, to count the editing mistakes. First it's a dirt road, then it's a busy highway; first the windshield is broken, the next second it's miraculously fixed. By the way, I want that guy's truck; talk about taking a licking and keeping on ticking! It goes through a house, but still looks like it came off the showroom floor. And after actually having a F-5 go RIGHT OVER THEM, they just sit there, like \\"cool\\". No awe, no wonder.     And by the way, why was she raised by heraunt, if her mother survived the tornado? That made no sense. But since nothing much else in this movie did, that's okay.      See Twister for the drive-in scene, and the last scenes in the barn/cornfield. Sorry to say, the rest was pretty bad.       By the way, the second star is for the scene where Hunt asks \\"Where's my truck?\\" and when it is hurled out of the tornado and smashes down yards from her, she deadpans \\"oh, there it is.\\"       Darn, what could have been...
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I hadn't heard about Muse until I was listening to my LaunchCast Radio station, and the song 'Time is Running Out' came on as a recommendation from fans of Coldplay and Radiohead. <br /> <br />The song is infectious. I found myself wanting to play it over and over again until I had it instilled forever in my mind. Then I branched out and found that other Muse songs are also equally as good. <br /> <br />On this album, I also enjoy the songs 'Apocalypse, Please,' and 'Sing for Absolution.' Although the same band, Muse can put together an array of styles that seems surprising, even if you're used to listening to such art forms as Coldplay or Radiohead. 'Time is Running Out,' and 'Apocalypse, Please,' show how the band has mastered rock and meaningful, rythmic lyrics. Then, on the opposite spectrum, there are songs like 'Sing for Absolution' which is a much softer version that does not compromise lyrical form to suit the more relaxing beats. <br /> <br />Overall, once you listen, you'll be hooked, too. Don't think of them as exactly as Radiohead, otherwise you may be disappointed. Simply see Muse as a creation of themselves, a unique band that has just as much to offer.
0780622650|4.0|When I first went to see this movie a couple of years ago, I didn't really like it.  I sat through it and thought, \\"Hmmmmmmmm, so I gave up washing my hair to see this?????\\"<br /><br />However having watched it again recently on TV, (there was nothing else on, I was a captive audience!) I think I was being too judgemental mainly because I am not a fan of the series \\"Friends\\" and having Matt Le Blanc as Major Don West irritated me no end.<br /><br />This was unfair on Le Blanc who actually was really good as Don West, and his sparing with Judy Robinson played by Heather Graham was really quite fun and sweet and done really well.<br /><br />William Hurt did well in his role as the starchy Space Dad and Mimi Rogers was excellent as his put upon and long suffering wife and the irritating Lacey Chabert as Penny Robinson was also quite endearing in small doses.  However the real show stealers were the Robot, Gary Oldman as the odious Doctor Smith and Jack Johnson as the bright but emotionally fragile Will Robinson.<br /><br />This \\"Lost in Space\\" is a lot slicker, and a lot darker than its 1960s counterpart, the earth that Robison's leave behind is slowly dying and the hope of humanity rests in the hands of one family who are now lost in space.<br /><br />There are great special effects, a really good and funky soundtrack, lots of action, some quite humorous moments, such as when Judy kisses Don and he looks really smug until he sees her father glaring at him from afar, along with Doctor Smith's screeches of \\"We're doomed! DOOMED!\\" and the little known trivia that several members of the old \\"Lost in Space\\" TV series had cameo roles in the movie!<br /><br />All in all this was a great movie, and I feel a little guilty about not appreciating its worth the first time around but we live and learn don't we?
0393035158|5.0|Today is 9/11 ...  04. Three years have gone by the horrible episodes of 2001. Instead of being enlightened by the atrocities we have plunged deeper in to faith based wars. Excuses that stand thin as paper and burn quicker than hay have been given for such military actions. Political and ethical divides seem to have collapsed in order to believe in the impossible. The battle of the invisible man, the battle for the right God. <br />As a species we are at the threshold of possible self-destruction, (once again). Only  faith propelled dementia can make humans kill and die with such absolute and unquestionable ways. Sam Harris has completed and published an immensely powerful book. If we thought nuclear inhalation was dangerous between communist and capitalist, this has become ridiculous wend compared to the real and imminent danger that faith based conflicts pose. Sam Harris, comprehensively, profoundly and clearly has highlighted the danger of faith and the needs to move forward as a species toward reason and humane behavior. \\"THE END OF FAITH Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason \\" has so eloquently provided words were only my instincts ventured. Please read this book. It is important and it is necessary. <br />Giorgio Bertuccelli
B00018D44U|5.0|Following the amazing commercial success of her debut album, \\"Come Away With Me,\\" the sultry Ms. Jones drew the fire of many sniffy, snobby jazz fans who grumbled that her vocals simply were not up to snuff, and that, perhaps, she shouldn't be called a jazz singer at all.  Well, boo-hoo.  Then maybe we of the \\"Americana\\" camp should claim her instead.  Her second album, \\"Feels Like Home,\\" certainly supports this theory, and as a certified, board-approved Americana know-it-all, I feel compelled to comment on an album that I think is, quite simply, a gem.<br /><br />Echoing Phoebe Snow, Seventies-era Bonnie Raitt, and hinting ever so slightly at the sharper attack of Mose Allison, Jones presents as fine, subtle and eclectic a set of roots-jazz music as you're ever likely to hear, one which draws on the inventive, introspective spirit of the early '70s singer-songwriter and acoustic rock scenes...  Slipping fluidly between reference points and influences, she seamlessly melds the styles, with an air of effortless authority and joyfulness... The album's musical tone is  downbeat, but the undercurrent is ecstatic, and much of this is due, I think, to the obvious self-knowledge that what she's doing is very good, and that this far-ranging, boundary defying music -- which would have been far, far off the radar had it not been for her success on the prior record -- has finally found a wider audience.  This album came after several tantalizing country-related one-offs, in particular a couple of fine live duets with Willie Nelson that really made me sit up and take notice (I would love it if those two did a whole album together!).  Willie didn't make it onto this album, but Jones does duet with Dolly Parton, on the bouncy \\"Creepin' In,\\" which was a minor hit on the Americana radio scene.  I wouldn't argue that this album is more, or less \\"jazz\\" than the last, but it certainly shows a growing confidence and comfortablity on Jones's part, and steady growth as an artist.  I'll also be interested in her future efforts... and I'm very much hoping that there really will be a Norah Jones-Willie Nelson duets album, someday soon.ll also be interested in her future efforts... and I'm very much hoping that there really will be a Norah Jones-Willie Nelson duets album, someday soon.
0790729369|5.0|Many reviewers have focused on the affair between National Geographic Photoghrapher Clint Eastwood and farm-wife Meryl Streep.  However, the theme of this film is really based on the discovery of the affair after Meryl's death and how her children came to terms with the affair.  Although there may have been a great attraction between the couple, and the farmer's health was ailing, there was really no excuse for the affair... otherwise, the cinaphotography was great and the story line enjoyable, and Clint potraying a photogapher for the National Geographic Magazine brought on a great interest after the movie.  The movie would have otherwise easily earned 4 stars.
B00001OH7O|5.0|David Bowie is one of the most known artists of the century,but unfortunately few have actually heard anything except a few of his major hits. One of these major hits is featured on Hunky Dory, \\"Changes\\",which is a materpiece in itself. Looking deeper into this album you find more and more stuff that is as good, if not better than \\"Changes\\". The exqusite \\"Oh!You Pretty Things\\" and \\"Life on Mars?\\" are both featured on Best of Bowie,but such great songs \\"The Bellway Brothers\\",\\"Queen Bitch\\",and\\"Quicksand\\" will never be largely heard. Which is unfortunate. These masterpieces which were not released as singles deserve much more repspect and it's sad to see songs pushed aside because they aren't single worthy. An absolutely brilliant and essential album, Hunky Dory is well worth the relatively low price it is now at. It's very easy to get into, relatively poppy and brilliant. Hunky Dory should be on any true music lovers shelf.
B0002VEXUA|5.0|With any luck, SONY and the other labels will revisit classic albums and do them up like this DVD. You get EVERYTHING associated with \\"Definitely Maybe\\": the album itself sounding better than it ever has (uncompressed PCM Stereo), all the videos, live footage, a documentary, and tons of other goodies. It's the best way to get a complete history of a classic album, and what was happening with the band at that time in history. BUY IT NOW!
B00004XQP4|5.0|I love every one of Green Day's albums, and this one, while not their best, is still fantastic.  The first time I listened to this CD I knew it would stay in my CD player for a long time.  I listened to pretty much nothing but this CD for at least a month.  I guarantee you'll be singing along to each and every one of the songs in no time.  The standout tracks, to me, are Warning, Misery, Church on Sunday, and Macy's Day Parade.  However, the rest of the songs are great as well, with the only exception being Blood, Sex, and Booze, which is okay, but for some reason I just don't like too much.    I highly recommend this CD to those who haven't gotten around to buying it yet...
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona is a great film with great images. Bergman expresses so much - with so much subtlety.

6303426468|4.0|While watching Arnold give his excellent speech at the RNC (Republican National Convention) a couple of weeks ago, I started to think about what movies I had seen him in. I had only seen him in two, and both of them were mediocre, at best. But I was in an \\"Arnold frame of mind,\\" so I went to the video store the very next day to take out an Arnold movie.    I couldn't decide between \\"Twins,\\" and \\"Junior.\\" I really only wanted one, because I know his movies usually aren't that great. But I just couldn't decide between them, so I rented both.    I watched \\"Junior\\" first. I was so pleasantly surprised - I really liked this. Not deserving of a full four stars; more like 3 and-a-half. I liked it so much I watched it twice, enjoying it even more the second time. Read Amazon's editorial review -- I agree with every single word written there.    Then I watcheed \\"Twins.\\" This I didn't care for. Too much crime/action, not enough comedy, and a very weak script. It just did not live up to its very promising premise.     I think \\"Junior\\" is a great \\"date video.\\" (Well, my gentleman friend liked it!)

0790733226|4.0|CONTACT poses the philosophical dilemma revolving around the existence of God..or a God.  Scientists are thought to believe only those things which can be proven...there has always been a battle between religion and science.  Carl Sagan's book and Robert Zemecki's movie are not afraid to approach this dilemma.  And it's ironic that in the end, the scientist faces a panel that asks for proof.  It's a difficult question, and no answers are given.<br /><br />The movie itself is a panoramic visual delight from the awesome opening to Ellie's travel to a distant galaxy.  Although the movie is a little long in the tooth, Zemeckis coaches a dynamite performance from Jodie Foster.  In her role as Ellie, Foster embodies the soul of a woman who has spent her life searching for answers, wanting to believe that there's more to life than us and our planet.  Using her distinctive voice, those beautiful eyes, and her heart-felt performance, Foster brings life to a complex, yet innocent, woman.  Matthew McConaughey as the spiritual former priest, Palmer Joss, uses his star power to enliven an otherwise poorly developed character.  The supporting cast has some good performances from William Fichter, as Ellie's blind companion; James Wood as a slimy National Security director; Tom Skerritt as the underhanded scientist who mocks Ellie and then when something occurs, takes the glory, and Angela Bassett as an aide to the president.  Zemeckis uses his FORREST GUMP technique of inserting the then real President Clinton into the film to authenticate the action.<br /><br />The film works mainly because of Foster.  This two time Oscar winner shows why she's one of our finest actresses.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Though I would hesitate to call this the greatest film, I would certainly rate it as one of the greatest debut films in the history of cinema along with Godard's 'Breathless'. Like Breathless, Kane instigated a revolution in film style that all subsequent film releases are greatly indebted to. I prefer Welles' 'Touch of Evil' to this one - but as far as originality and breathtakeing visual talent are concerned - Kane is right at the top.  Welles was uncompromising - and thank god for that!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I'm at a loss to understand the tone of all these rigidly negative reviews of Cuaron's adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. What these critics fail to appreciate, in their inflexible rant against an artist who dares to follow his own muse, is that art is not meant to be repetitive or imitative. Why would I want to see a film that slavishly and superficially follows a book's plot and every twist of substory (never mind the fact that it would make for a four hour stint in a movie theater)?<br /><br />Clearly, JKR herself had no problem with Cuaron's work, perhaps because she understood that he was creating something unique with this film; and I agree with her. Cuaron has taken a marvelous book and turned it into a truly original piece of filmmaking. Rowling's metaphorical themes are held intact (the boggart of fear; the dementors of depressive illness; the deep currents of time and growth); meanwhile, Cuaron has given his extraordinary visual gift to these themes. His landscapes are rough-hewn and always layered: the characters are seen climbing uphill or juddering downhill; lurching over dark, uneven terrain, surrounded by oversized objects and animals which themselves appear possessed of consciousness (even the whomping willow seems more alive than it did in the prior film). The cgi is nearly flawless, and is never allowed to dominate the character development or artistic values of the film, but rather to serve and enhance them. The Buckbeak scene, set to another moving piece of John Williams \\"flying music\\", is an example of this--an adolescent boy is being given a humbling and exhilarating lesson on the human place in the magical realm of Nature, and his growth as an individual from this experience is palpable to any sensitive viewer.<br /><br />You could look anywhere in this film and see the same marriage of visual beauty and deep understanding of the metaphor--in the encounters with the symbols of the soul's night, the dementors; in the variously-textured teachings on facing fear and its source (the boggart scene, the meeting with the werewolf, the time-turner scene; and in the wonderfully-rendered depictions of the misjudgments and depredations of institutional justice (the Buckbeak execution scene and the collective's obsession with guilt and punishment in its mindless pursuit of Sirius). And finally, Cuaron does a delightful job of making Rowling's humor live and dance throughout this film: there is not a self-conscious or stagnant moment in this entire film.<br /><br />So I would ask the triflers and fault-finders to simply relax and let art be art. If you would like to see the story exactly as you want to see it, go back to Rowling's novel and let your own imagination guide you from there. But if you would like to see a film, then let the filmmaker take you into his experience through the window of his art. But if you want to see mere slavish imitation, then you are not looking for art, but rather for mere contrivance.

0446691437|5.0|Know the enemy, know yourself, wrote Sun Tzu in his classic The Art of War, and your victory will be certain.  For anyone who is stuck at a level below their God-given potential, who can't seem to get on track to do the things they need to do in order to achieve their most authentic goals, knowing the enemy and knowing yourself are one and the same.<br /><br /> Steve Pressfield's magnificent little book The War of Art is about being more creative - but more important, it's also about fulfilling your potential as a human being.  To do this, he says, you must overcome Resistance (the \\"R\\" is capitalized be Pressfield to represent the fact that it is a very real entity - as real to your authentic Self as Charles Manson or Genghis Khan were to their victims).<br /><br /> The whole aim of Resistance, says Pressfield (who is the bestselling author of The Legend of Bagger Vance and Gates of Fire), is to prevent you from doing the work you are called to do.  Resistance wants you to take it easy, to be ordinary and mediocre, to take the low road.  Resistance is the reason so many people place a basket over the brilliant candle that shines within them.  The fight against Resistance is, Pressfield says, a war to the death.<br /><br /> Pressfield disputes the standard motivational clich&eacute; that you can have, do, or be anything if you follow the right formula and just work hard enough.  Rather, he says:  \\"We are not born with unlimited choices...  Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal that we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.\\"<br /><br /> There are two occasions when Resistance will be the most relentless, and they are related.  The first is when something really matters to you.  \\"Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.\\"  If your lifelong goal is to be a writer, a rejection letter from a publisher will hurt a whole lot more than if you submitted your manuscript on a dare.<br /><br /> The second occasion that Resistance is most dangerous is related to what Pressfield calls \\"the mother of all fears,\\" namely the fear that you will actually succeed.  Resistance builds as you get closer to the finish line.  \\"At this point, Resistance knows we're about to beat it.  It hits the panic button.  It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got.\\"  There is a real paradox here: the closer you get to reaching that proverbial tipping point, where things are really starting to click, the more likely you are to engage in the self-sabotaging behavior that is the calling card of Resistance.<br /><br /> Pressfield offers a prescription for defeating Resistance.  You must, he says, become \\"a pro.\\"  But he does not mean that in the sense of earning a living at the work, in the sense of being a member of a certain profession, or in the sense of being looked up to by your peers.  Rather, he simply means showing up every day with your lunch pail and getting to work.  Much of the book has to do with how you make this transformation so that you can do the work that you are called to do.<br /><br /> I have made a small poster with this quote from Steve's book and placed it prominently above my computer:  \\"There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.  This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.  This second, we can sit down and do our work.\\"  My own next book has been on the back-burner for far too long, victim to Resistance.  But now I have a weapon: Every time Resistance stands between me and doing my work, I pull Steve's book from out of my bookshelf and beat Resistance over the head.  Then in that very second, I sit down and do my work.  And it's working.le lot more than if you submitted your manuscript on a dare.   <br /> <br /> The second occasion that Resistance is most dangerous is related to what Pressfield calls \\"the mother of all fears,\\" namely the fear that you will actually succeed.

B000002AGE|5.0|Back in the late 70's, I just started to venture out and expand my musical tastes from just rock and bought my first jazz records; George Benson's \\"Breezin'\\", Stanley Clarkes' \\"School Days\\", and by sheer luck due to hearing that particular day the vast, unified wall of beautiful developing sound with the electronic keyboards of Joe Zawinul and the funkified, dancing bass of the masterful Jaco Pastorius both leading in a full, somewhat Big Band style, the now classic jazz perennial standard, \\"Birdland\\" (as well as this impressionable teenager checking out the cool album cover) of this landmark album, \\"Heavy Weather\\".  Not a bad start to enjoy the beauty of Jazz with these three album gems for initiation !!!    \\"Heavy Weather\\" expanded my listening pleasures in further understanding and appreciating craft and artistic musicianship as it further defined Weather Report as a \\"supergroup\\" in an at-the-time stale jazz-rock movement suddenly being revamped with the help and popularity of this now classic.    Lead by an ultra-talented trio of co-founder Zawinal, Pastorius - who brought a new breath of fresh air in bringing a moving, funky, staccato bass and creating another melodic voice, and the sizzling saxophonist, Wayne Shorter, \\"Heavy Weather\\" contains remarkable and timeless songs like the ingenious classics \\"A Remark You Made\\", \\"Teen Town\\", \\"Harlequin\\", \\"Palladium\\", \\"The Juggler\\" and the spectacular ending workout \\"Havona\\". This band creates by no means mainstream, commercial jazz but an extremely clever, interesting, sometimes complex fusion textured yet smooth, dreamy approachable jazz sophisication for the listener to really sit back, close their eyes and truely appreciate the beauty of the musicianship of what they are hearing.    This album is an absolute must for all who appreciate rock and jazz fusion !!!

B0001AP12G|5.0|For the last three years, rap and hip-hop quality has gone downhill (with few exceptions).  Obviously, most of these artists are mostly in the industry for the money, causing the music to sound unoriginal and uninspired.  Therefore, they became careless of the final result.  However, in early 2004, Kanye West released his debut album \\"College Dropout\\".  The timing was perfect.  This gave the genre a breath of fresh air, proving that rap and hip-hop can still be outstanding.  Many other artists have demanded his production on their tracks since this release: Alicia Keys, Brandy, Twista, and others.    Through his songwriting, rapping, and producing, he created the best rap album this year.  This is one of the best debuts in rap history.  His beats are always catchy and original.  Occasionally, he combines his signature hip-hop beats with another genre: gospel, R&B, dance, and pop.  Such variety gives this album the interesting swings.  Despite the numerous sampling from other songs, he manages to make these tracks his own.  Lyrically, he explores many issues that many modern-day rap artists wouldn't dare, especially religion (\\"Jesus Walks\\") and urgent issues that corrupt this world everyday (\\"We Don't Care\\").  His passionate powerful messages keep audiences listening closely.  His words are obviously true to his heart as expressed beyond them whether he's raunchy or sweet.    \\"College Dropout\\" is a great rap album for those looking for a great escape from the common mainstream nonsense.  This album proves that Kanye West will be a superstar for a long time.    ***Expect Kanye West to lead the 2004 Grammy nominations with minimim nine: Album of the Year, Record of the Year (\\"Jesus Walks\\"), Best New Artist, Producer of the Year, Best Rap Album, Best Male Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and twice Best Rap/Sung Performance (\\"Slow Jamz\\" w/ Twists & Jamie Foxx and \\"Let's Talk About Love\\" w/Brandy).
B00000IQW5|5.0|When I saw this movie, I immidiatley got close to Richard Dreyfuss's character.  However, his wonderful life with his soon to be wife and best friend(John Goodman) quickly ends as Dreyfuss's plane blows up like the forests that he use to put out.  Just when you think that this is the last time you see Dreyfuss he comes back as great as ever.  However as a spirit to guide a totally different pilot. Richard Dreyfuss then observes his past life with his wife drift away as she falls for the man of whom he is watching over.  However, his wife does not seem to want to let Dreyfuss go away from her.  This movie is a painfull one to watch but the fact that somewhere inside of Dreyfuss's wife tells her that he is right here and will be there in her heart always.
B00005JMAH|3.0|It is clear in this movie that the director was more interested in an \\"artsy\\" sort of movie than to focus on characters, events, and following the book, and even the dialogue is insipid and unlike the characters in the book.  He left out very important events, slicing a 400+ page book in just 2 1/2 hours (should have been at least 3 hours long.)  The crucial part of the book was between Scabbers and Crookshanks and in the movie they only had one small line regarding them.  Because the movie was so short, it feels like the events are always going too fast, like an extended \\"climax\\" of the movie that is overkill.  Very weak.
B00003CXCT|5.0|On the Star Wars 'fan scale' from 1 to 10, I'm a 6.  What that means, I think, is that I'm a regular fan who appreciates (and even cherishes) the masterful storytelling represented by this groundbreaking trilogy.  I have tremendous respect for these movies.  Years ago, my girlfriend admitted that she had never seen any of them.  Well, she actually sat down with me one night and we watched all three of them in a marathon - how can you not marry a girl who would do something like that?  (We're married now...)<br /><br />For those of you looking for an actual professional take on this best rendition of the series to-date, I suggest you look up the very recently posted 2-page review of this actual box set on the [...] web site.  I have been reading this site's careful analyses of DVDs since 1999 and trust them tremendously.  In fact, the main editor on the site is one of the founders of the infamous petition letter that convinced Lucas to issue these movies on DVD.  In short, the editor LOVES this set and admits they're the BEST you've ever seen AND heard these films.  And he actually APPROVES of most of the digital edits that Lucas took the creative liberty to do(The website also has screenshots and side-by-side comparisons of the edits).<br /><br />In short, these movies are going to be so thrilling when they are released a few short weeks from now, but don't be surprised if there are even more deluxe high-definition versions of these movies offered several years down the road.  Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. It's silly for folks to vote this review not useful.  Because NOBODY who has written reviews has had access to a preview of this box set, the information I provide is of great relevance.  I offer not just my opinion, but provide references for more informed information - how could that NOT be useful?  Silly, silly...<br /><br />P.S.S. Not to mention the fact that my review actually offers SOME of you hope that your interest in Star Wars might actually get a girl interested in you at some point...  :-)me point...   :-)
B000002KNY|5.0|A mix of funky tunes, drum beats and excellent pace - I still listen to this album 25 years later......<br />My first exposure to Talking Heads and it hooked me
156898443X|3.0|I am such a huge fan of visual journals, and looking at the divine binding of this book, I figured it was another to find its place among my vast collection of distinctive gorgeous colourful journals. <br /> <br />However, I don't think that Danny Gregory's work is quite as good as similar pieces on the market. While it is has some wonderful drawings and some heartfelt ideas, there is not necessarily as much substance as you might find in other books. <br /> <br />I particularly loved the drawings and thoughts on Gregory's European trip, but to be honest, I found many of his observations to be very American, or at least American-centric. Considering he was raised in England and other parts of the world, this was a disaapointing shock.  <br /> <br />Not only that, I thought many of his considerations had undertones of the privledged vastly cynical urbanite. While I did sympathise with his struggles, I imagine I would have liked the work more if this current did not exist and I felt like he actually embraced the purpose of his title. The often cycnical commentary and his greater ideals about quiet art just did not seem to correlate. <br /> <br />It was a lovely adventure into how partners deal with the debilitating inflictions of their loved ones, but I really prefer the calm kind journals of Dan Price, whose drawings Gregory is evidently also inspired by.
B000002MTR|5.0|Dave Navarro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers for one album and I'm an sure glad to see that.  Dave Navarro is one of the greatest guitarests in rock n' roll ever.  I guess you can say this is the Red Hot Chili Peppers psychadelic album, but trust me, there is a funk underlay throughout the whole album, thanks to Flea.  Warped has to be one of the best songs the Chili Peppers have ever written.  Walkabout also has some nice guitar in the middle thanks to Navarro.  Very funky song.  Anyways, what I'm trying to say is don't sleep on this amazing album because it may be a little different for them.  If you start listening to it, you will notice that the style isn't really that far off from their usual style.  Either way, please enjoy.
0440238609|5.0|Doesnt everyone love this series if they have read it? If the dont they should. This is because Philip Pullman has managed to write a book that is not only imaginative and entertaining but also has a deeper meaning to it. I dont know if i will ever find a book that is as fantastic as this one. It is about a young girl who goes on the most awesome adventure. Even if she is only 12 her maturity is shown throughout the book which made it oh so much better to read. I recomend this book for anyone. Ages 7 to 99 it doesnt matter
0684857219|5.0|1) Comprehensiveness - <br />There's not a single book that can boast of the same overall coverage of bodybuilding that this one can. Let's say you aim to take several college courses to assist your bodybuilding knowledge; you'd still have to take one introductory one, one in simple nutrition, one in advanced nutrition, one in general kinesiology, one in exercise physiology, one in advanced exercise physiology, and so on and so forth. The same applies to most other books. This encyclopedia, at 800 chocobloc pages, covers beginner-intermediate and mildly advanced ground comfortably and in a handy cross-indexed reference method, with additional tips thrown in from the man who brought the sport out of its shell: Arnold Schwarzennegger. <br /> <br />2) Value for Money - <br />800 pages at 17 bucks is a steal. I ordered this item, and with ground shipping had the cost add up to about $21 dollars. Still cheap for an 800 page compendium! <br /> <br />3) Above and Beyond - <br />Aside from all the valuable textbook-style knowledge, you'll also get Arnie's own special inputs (of course updated in 1998), a nice glimpse at bodybuilding history, some tips on basic supplementation and a great section to help you if you're a competitor. The book is stacked with personal tips; chances are they'll help you pack on muscle faster than before. <br /> <br />4) Indirect Value - <br />The book also has an indirect value. If you're one of those people who buys muscle magazines for your routines and info, you can happily junk that nonsense. First of all, muscle magazines get kind of tiring, with their 'NEW AND HOT OFF THE SHELVES' this-and-that every month, their juiced-up routines and their annoying Muscletech ads, and, Weider-endorsed or not, they have a hell of a lot less credibility. With Arnold's guide in hand, you can say goodbye to dollars wasted on muscle mags for unhelpful information. <br /> <br />Finally, I just want to answer the very few people who've criticized this product on account of the fact that Arnold would severely overtrain back in his days, both on account of limited knowledge at the time and his excessive steroid habits. I've read the book cover-to-cover, referred to it several times, know it pretty much inside-out, and I can't find ONE instance where his preaches this overtraining. Whether this is because of the recent update or not, Arnold actually warns against being 'too enthusiastic' as this can hinder your gains, and devotes a few pages to the overtraining issue. Obviously the few that have criticized the encyclopedia based on Arnold's other work (namely \\"Bodybuilding for Men\\", which glosses over nutrition and recommends a highly juiced training schedule), have never actually gone through this book. <br /> <br />So in short, buy the damn book! It's cheap, it's huge, it's handy, and it'll help you get bigger like no amount of supplements can.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is one of the best stories of the last couple of years. To completely explain what it is about is hard, since there is so much going on. Some of the themes are cancer, dying, drugs, children and love but there are so many more. One of the themes I particulary saw was loneliness. <br /> <br /> <br />All of the actors are playing their best role in this movie. Tom Cruise as sex-guru TJ Mackey, JC Reilly as a moral cop and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a caring male nurse. WH Macy is also great as the failure quiz kid Donny who has a crush an a male bar tender. <br /> <br />It is over three hours long but never gets boring, sometimes it even amazed you like when all the characters are singing along to the same song. Every item, every shot means something for the story. <br /> <br />Great movie, great story, see it. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Hype, ah yes, that old chestnut. What strage things this entity does to the human brain. People are constantly hoodwinked into forking out sums of money for such bands as Franz Ferdinand. It works as a numbing tool, hype. The Libertines are another one. As one reviewer has already pointed out, in a few years you will have forgotten all about this group; totally wiped from your small minds. There will be a new Franz Ferdinand on your music system, playing the same tunes, thieved from every artist of the past fifty years, from Elvis to The Clash.  <br />First off, the music here, the thoroughly 'original' spiky guitars and riffs have been done a thousand times before. Elsewhere.Better. Secondly, the lyrics represent some kind of literate nadir. Even the Strokes have more intelligent lyrics than these (and that's saying something). There is not a single thoughtful, decent lyric or phrase on this record. It goes in one ear and out the other like thin air. I find it strange that in such times as ours (in the UK, as well as US) there are so few songs written about the political and social situation we inhabit currently. It should be a breeding ground for musical artistry. The film industry - so belittled by some - has tackled it head on, so why can't modern, young musicians. It seems to be being adressed more by older artists whose best years are behind them. They've done it all before anyway. <br />So here it is. The alternative to music. The alternative to intelligence. 'The' band of the moment. Listen and wallow in blissful hype. <br />Absolutely sickening
B00008EY65|1.0|I thought Dare Devil was bad, but Hellboy seems to have done the impossible and is even worse. So why is it so bad? The story line is just lame!!!! It is not even simple to follow, it just seems to be a load of pointless action scenes. Although I think the character Helboy is cool, that stupid fish boy is just boring and the fire girl is so wooden. I think there could be a good film in the franchise, but this is just poor. Avoid at all costs!!!!
068987474X|5.0|Have you ever sat at home mad or in tears because the guy you're dating hasn't called? Have you ever made excuses for him like: He's busy, he's shy, he's just not a talker? Stop wasting your time. As this funny and frank book points out if a man is interested in you you'll know it. It's not that he's a jerk although he may be or that there's something wrong with you it's just that there's no magical spark between you. The book says stop fussing and move on. That's great advice plus \\"He's Not That Into You\\" is highly entertaining and easy to read.   This is a worthwhile buy.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I will be getting the DVD's as a birthday present, but I had to say something about another reviewer's comments that tends to miss the point about certain things.<br /><br />I've heard about Lucas' additions to these films, what with placing Hayden's face in place of the original actor's image in Return of the Jedi, and I have to say that it was a bad choice to make. Where another reviewer chastised \\"old school\\" Star Wars fans for not liking this change, he kept commenting about how the old films looked worse than today's films, as if that justified such a change. He missed the point.<br /><br />The point being that new, better looking special effects do not a story make. Maybe some equate eye-candy with quality, but for those with more discernment, we realize that the story is the story, with or without fancy special effects. We don't need to see Hayden's face to appear in Jedi to connect the prequels with the \\"old\\" films. Alas, maybe some do, but for those of us who grew up with Star Wars (or just grew up), we can bridge the gap and see all six movies as one whole. I would challenge the previous reviewer to recognize that Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is a character, he's not Hayden C. Hayden C. is an actor. Hayden's face does not need to be seen for grown-ups to realize that Darth Vader once was Anakin Skywalker. Lucas' addition of his face is basically saying to the fans: \\"I think you're all too stupid to realize what's what unless I spoon-feed you and use imagery to hold your hands, since seeing a different face on the 'restored' Anakin in Jedi will confuse you all.\\" In the case of those who like this change, maybe he's right...<br /><br />I wonder how long before he re-releases another set of DVDs with the current Obi-Won's face superimposed over that of Alec Guiness. After all, wouldn't that add to the continuity as well? At least, for those who need it?
B00003CXCT|5.0|What gets me is when a director releases a Director's Cut of any movie, people love it. But when George Lucas adds something here and there, those some people cry. Yes! I believe movies should be release as the were showen at theaters, but some times it's nice to see something new. I love The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly! One of the greatest films ever made, and the new 2 disc DVD set has 18 added minutes.....yet I don't hear anyone crying! Star Wars is a George Lucas creation! If he wants to add new things to his movies then more power to him. If you don't like what see...then don't buy the DVD boxset, just stick with the VHS tapes and enjoy them!
B00006JKOL|2.0|This is the album where Ian Anderson became a self-parody, a real Olde Englishe minstrel/bard straight from Central Casting. Tull's music always had a strain of English folk in it, but it was always just alluded to and was balanced out by enough blues and rock elements to keep them from sounding like a historic exercise a la Steeleye Span. And while Ian's stage get-up included some strange medieval-looking boots, he basically looked like just another wacky hippie. But for some reason on this album Ian decided he needed to beat everyone over the head with Ye Olde Concept and started appearing on stage in some second-hand Shakespearian garb. He pursued this schtick relentlessly through the next two albums, \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\", at which time I stopped buying Tull albums.
B000002GBJ|5.0|when i first bought this record i did not knew what i was getting, but then i played it and let me tell you something it was great, i mean all of the pieces were amazing, i personally enjoyed track number 5, i don`t know it justhas something mystic about it, how it changes tempo, it blew me away, this type of work really tells you what kinde of musician was rick, he`s great, good `ole prog rock to really expand your mind!! <br /> <br />after all he comes from one hella`va of a band
B0000028MA|4.0|This soundtrack for the film 'Singles' gives a nice overview of the (mainly Seattle) alternative music scene of the early 90's. The best track on this album is 'Drown' by the Smashing Pumpkins (who were actually not from Seattle but from Chicago). Buy this album if you're looking for a good introduction in the best the Seattle music scene had to offer in those days. As far as the film 'Singles' itself is concerned; i've never seen it!
B00003CXDG|1.0|I was shocked when I saw the first Mission: Impossible movie, because I had gotten a copy of M:I-2 as a present a couple years beforehand and was not at all impressed. Summary: Hunky guy is recruited with a pair of sunglasses in a rocket. Must recruit cute British-Oriental girl but he sleeps with her before even knowing what she's going to do, which is to get back with her ex so they can find out about a super-sinister virus created to make a market for an antidote. Ex-boyfriend has stolen it and is planning to auction it off, etc. Spy team's sloppy tradecraft gets Cute Girl caught and after an elaborate series of events (how is it that Hunky Guy is considered cool and original when Ex-boyfriend knows his infiltration plan down to the tiniest detail?) Cute Girl makes herself into the only specimen of the virus. Hunky guy shouts \\"I won't lose you!\\" and proceeds to kick and punch his way to victory (oh and did I mention there's lame motorcycle jousting?). Cure is administered. Happy reunion. Fadeout.  <br />Listen for the cool Metallica song in the credits. It's the best part.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I discovered Renee on the Late Show with David Letterman and she knocked my socks off! Her CD is accessible for everyone. Can't say I was ever into jazz or torch songs but she makes them interesting to listen to. The pop tunes are as good as, if not better, than the originals. Yes, Renee is the real deal, but even more so, she's an improvement over much of what came before. Order this CD today and prepare to be amazed!
B0000074FL|5.0|This wasn't the first time I heard Thin Lizzy, but this was the album that hooked me and made me go back to discover all their previous material. And I am so greatful that I did. Though they will always be remembered for their harmony guitars, I think that Phil Lynott's song writing ability played an even bigger part in their sound. They could play in just about any musical style and still make it sound like rock n roll. Renegade displays that ability very well. Check out \\"Mexican Blood\\". Not just any rock band could pull that style off. The same goes for \\"Fats\\". Then there is the title track. It kind of reminds of Rush in a sense that it is a long tune with some odd time signatures thrown in. But of course it sounds nothing like Rush. Lizzy could play in any style and any time and still make it rock. This album is a great example of that ability. But then again, what Lizzy ablum isn't??
0553260111|5.0|I read the Bourne Identity more than 20 years ago when it was first published.  After I saw the recent Bourne movies, I realized that I could not track events back to the book (relying on my memory, of course) so I decided to drag out the book (that's why I never throw away a book) and refresh my memory.  As one of the other reviewers pointed out, it isn't the same story.  Sometimes, I can understand why changes are made to transfer a book to the screen, but it seems that we are in an era when the movie maker simply wants to buy the name of the author and the title of a popular book so he can create the movie he wants and have a title that will draw fans. <br /> <br />The Bourne Identity is an excellent book that contains a story much more complex and interesting than the one told in the movie.  Ludlum painstakingly leads the reader through Jason Bourne's thoughts as he realizes that he has amnesia, has some very unusual abilities that are both impressive and frightening, and has people trying to kill him for some reason.  While they can convey the idea on the big screen, they cannot involve the viewer in the character's mind the way a good writer can with words (When I hear someone say, \\"One picture is worth a thousand words\\", I am always tempted to say, \\"Not if the right person writes the words\\"). <br /> <br />So if you saw The Bourne Identity and liked it and thought it could have been even better if it had a good story, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK.
6302508878|5.0|More than 70 years since its initial release, \\"King Kong\\" (1933) remains the monster epic by which all other genre films are measured. Often remade yet never surpassed, it represents a one-of-a-kind landmark in cinema history, with remarkable visual effects by Willis O'Brien. Accept no substitutes!
B00004U8JV|3.0|Overall, this film is a disappointment when compared to Jurassic Park.  Everything just seems thrown together and out of order.  It's completely obvious that the scares are meant to, well, scare you, but they just lack perspective.  Anyways, on to the plot... <br />   Ian Malcolm( played by Jeff Goldblum) must go to Isla Sorna, site B to retrieve his girlfriend Sara,( played by Julianne Moore) who has only too willingly agreed to go on an expedition commissioned by the late John Hammond,( played by Richard Attenborough) who in an unfortunate turn of events, has lost his company InGen.  So, before the scientists can get too comfortable, BAM!  InGen's helicopters fill the air and military units mobilize to collect..something.  Anyways, between dodging spikey Stegosaurus tails, eluding the Velociraptors in a momentarily suspenseful scene in the tall, tall grass, and eventually the films's climax(?) with the Tyrannosaurus escaping from capture( surprisingly) and running around San Diego, it's clear the writers and producers had action and \\"good intentions\\" in mind, but sadly, it just didn't look as good on screen as it did on paper. <br />   I would recommend seeing this movie only to decide for yourself if it is disappointing.  Afterall, everyone is different, right? <br />
B0001GMIOE|4.0|I couldn't argue against the fact that a Canon camera works well with a Canon battery, but actually the converse is not true. I own the BP511 (came with my Digital Rebel) and I recently bought a Delkin Devices BP511 analog. The Delkin product stores 1400 mhA vs 1100 for the Canon, and is half the price. I have friends who have used Delkin for a year without any problems, so I don't see why I would buy this product instead of the cheaper non-Canon battery.
055321263X|5.0|I didn't think this would be my type of book, but I ended up loving it. Much better than other Collins reading, in my opinion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a twenty-something geek who will take a chance on any show that is sci fi or comic book related. I even already watch shows on FOX. In short, I am the target demographic for Firefly. The fact that I had never heard of this show until I started hearing my friends rave about the DVDs should be a clear indication that somebody at FOX was not doing their job. <br /> <br />Firefly is some of the best science fiction ever made in any medium, and one of the best television shows ever. Period. Since I was introduced to it, I have watched it twice start to finish. I have shown the pilot episode to six different people, and every one of them has loved it. Its complex themes and in-depth characters resonate with me in a way nothing on television ever has before. <br /> <br />Watching these DVDs is a bittersweet affair, because there are so many moments where you can see these tiny, beautiful seeds of the bigger picture being planted one by one, but of course FOX uprooted the show before they were able to bear fruit. Every time I reach the last episode, I feel a little twinge in my heart, because I so badly want to know what happens next. What is Book's story? What changes are going to come over Jayn as a result of his actions on Ariel? Who exactly are Blue Sun, and what is their agenda? These are things I care about, and you will care about them, too, after you watch the show. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD set. Watch the movie when it comes out next summer. And maybe, if we're very very lucky, the movie will do well enough that somebody will realize what a treasure this show was, and they will pick the show back up, and we can continue the story.
B0002IU988|5.0|THE SONGS ARE REALLY AMAZING. MYLES KENNEDY DEFINITELY PROVED HE IS NOT MAINLY A REPLACEMENT FOR SCOTT. HE MADE EACH SONG TRUE TO ITS MESSAGE, SANS THE MELODRAMATIC APPROACH BY WHICH I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR SOME DAYS. WHAT YOU GET IS REALLY ROCK DOWN PAT. THE MUSIC, ABSOLUTELY TREMONTI ET AL(THAT IS CREED) THROUGH AND THROUGH. YOU RECOGNIZED IT RIGHT AWAY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. HE IS ONE OF THE GUITAR PLAYER I DEFINITELY RESPECT, TOTALLY HUMBLE IN EVERY INTERVIEW AND REALLY KNOWS HOW TO SHOW HIS STUFF.THIS ALBUM IS MORE THAN ALL THAT HYPE, IT HAS SUBSTANCE.
0452282152|5.0|Very imaginative prose, and wonderfully developed characters. It's amazingly deep and thoughtful for its rather short length. The many intertwining themes are played well throughout the plot and the feeling of time passing, the feeling of time lost and of changes that occur in life. Probably one of the most profound themes of the story is the array of choices one has, and how to go about choosing the right path in life. Overall, a great read, written with words of intelligence, simplicity, and innocence.
B00009V7RF|4.0|I bought this cd for my niece and I ended up listening to it more often. It is not so much about the offensive lyrics that some of the songs have that I did not let my niece listen to it but because I genuinely like this album. This is refreshing as oppose to most of the gangsta rap and those bling,bling,bling mediocre rap that dominates the airwave and mtv. Metal rap is okay since it provides outlet for those teenager angst that every teenager goes through as long as there is this label for explicit lyrics. Four stars for this album since 1)I think it is so irresponsible for them not to put a warning and 2)there were two songs that are just filler, other than these reasons this is THE PARTY album. You can help but shake and sing along.BEP could still make it through the mainstrean arena without the help of Mr.J.T. with this fine crafted album but then, you get by with a little help from your friends.
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is a classic, not only does it have alot of octane powered singles, but 50 puts the messege of the streets out there, so that todays thugs can understand. with this album 50 cent has established himself on the rap walk of fame, putting some original, as well as underground songs on his debut CD. If you ever get your hands on his 1999 release of \\"power of the dollar\\" you can instantly tell that his flows have become more tighter, raw, grittier, and straight up hood. With pussy rappers out there (Missy Elliot/Ja Rule), there ain't denying that their music isn't going to be around much. cuz people want to hear whats real, and whats good. 50 Cent is taking over the world, as well as everyone's street credentials. 50 Cent Is The Future
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is the most beautiful pop rock album in existence.  Brian Wilson proves here that not only is he capable of writing irrepressibly catchy music but he has an added depth for emotional expression.  Tony Asher's lyrics in songs such as \\"You Still Believe In Me\\", \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\\", \\"Caroline No\\" and throughout the rest of the album provide an understated poetic quality to the musical lushness.  As would be expected the vocal harmonies are unparalleled in modern music, not only in terms of quality but complexity.  Brian Wilson's studio wizardry truly shines as he continually pushes the envelop to develop a new a refreshing sound.  An ingenious blend of ochestral instrumentaton give the album a grace and elegance sorely missed in much of today's music.  Perhaps the most enduring thing about Pet Sounds is that with every listen a new and exciting discovery is made.  It would be a shame if the music of this album was overshadowed by a stupid forty year old debate about the Beach Boys and the Beatles.  The wonderful Rubber Soul inspired Brian Wilson's musical ambitions, not so much the music itself.  We could argue over what is the best album of all time forever, but it would be pointless.  We all have our own respective opinions, I think I've made mine clear.  Simply divine.  Brian Wilson is a genius.
1594200106|5.0|Best book I've read all year.  Little wonder that this has been Spain's best seller for so long.  Easily deserves 5-star rating.
B000003TBP|5.0|Odelay is, in my opinion, Beck's most important album of his entire 10 or so year career. It's like an intersection of all the styles he has or will experiment on in whole albums. For example, a song like \\"New Pollution\\", a techno-esque stylistic pop ballad is a style Beck will further elaborate on, in the album \\"Midnite Vultures\\". The grunge, droning tunes of songs like \\"Devils Haircut\\" is the basis of the album Beck made before Odelay, \\"Mellow Gold\\". This pattern is consistent throughout Beck's career, which means that almost any genre or style he's accomplished in other albums can be easily traced to at least one or two songs in Odelay. It's an album that, not only was a defining moment in Beck's career, but it also appeals to music lovers of practically every taste. It rarely gets old to listen to, and is almost overwhelmingly layered, making it a joy to unveil something new each time it's played.
B004SIP88Y|4.0|HERO was originally released in Asia in 2002 under the title YING XIONG. The film stars Jet Li as a fighter and local lawman known as Nameless. The movie takes place in ancient times when the country of China did not yet exist and was simply a broken nation of seven different kingdoms. The King of Qin is a wise and mighty ruler and is determined to unite the warring kingdoms into one country. Nameless is sent to the King after it is known that he has killed three assassins, two men and one woman, who have tried to murder the King before. Nameless tells his story and a battle of wits ensues as the story is revised several times.<br /><br />There is some pretty darn cool sword fighting that takes place in HERO and the visual imagery is stunningly beautiful. The plot device of retelling the story several times makes the film more interesting than if it was a simple straightforward tale and the slow character development of Nameless and King that builds before our eyes augments the other positive aspects of the movie.<br /><br />However, HERO is a movie and simply as a movie, it's not as good as it could have been. For example, some of the action sequences are drawn out way too long and come off as being cheesy (many in the theatre I attended laughed at some of the most serious battle sequences in the film). Also, because the story is retold several times, viewers can easily become confused and disinterested. As a work of art though, HERO is magnificent and is worth watching just to admire its beauty. Appreciate it for what it is and nothing more.
B000089RVX|5.0|This was the first album I had bought in a long time, and it was mostly due to a fluke.  I had heard their song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio, and one day while at Target my mom offered to buy me the CD.  Having been unsucessful at finding their tracks online, I decided to pick this up.  For the next 6 weeks weeks at work the only thing I listened to while programming was this CD over and over again.    Amy Lee has an extremely powerful voice that helps to add to the haunting lyrics.  Each of the tracks has something to offer, and not every one is a rock song, for example, My Immortal and Hello are piano solos.  They are, in my opinion, the most beautiful songs I have heard since \\"Wasted Time\\" by the Eagles and \\"American Pie\\" by Don McLean.    Since purchasing the CD, I have been to a total of three of their shows, and am eagarly awaiting their next album.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music.  A word of warning, however.  If you're buying this because they sound like Linkin Park, I don't want you to be surprised that they don't.  Only their original single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" sounds like that, and that's due to Paul McCoy's guest appearance.  The rest of the songs are less like Linkin Park and more of a standard rock, though the lyrics do sometimes have gothic overtones.    One more word before I finish this review.  In the course of my concerts I have seen every type there, from the young 12 year olds to people of age 60.  Their music has something to offer to anyone, and don't refrain from buying simply because you feel you might be too old for it.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|CROSSROADS (Walter Hill's Blues film, NOT Britney Spears' self-indulgent 2002 fluff) is a terrific introduction to a uniquely American musical genre, with a remarkable cast and a dead-on southern 'atmosphere'. It has always astonished me that when released, critics were unable to look past Ralph Macchio's previous film work, and accept this gem on it's own merits, but it's subsequent status as a cult classic is certainly well-deserved, with films such as the Coens' O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? utilizing the Robert Johnson subplot and borrowing many of CROSSROAD's visual elements. Perhaps the film, with a magnificent Ry Cooder score, was just too far ahead of it's time, a strange criticism to apply to a Blues movie!<br /><br />The tale involves young Long Island guitar prodigy Eugene 'Lightning Boy' Martone (Macchio), a rebel at the Julliard School with his passion for the Blues (\\"Primitive music,\\" one professor sneers), on a quest to recover legendary guitarist Johnson's fabled \\"30th Song\\" of 1938. His research leads him to a NYC nursing home, where fabled harmonica player Willie Brown (the late actor/singer/songwriter Joe Seneca), a friend and collaborator of Johnson's, is confined. Promising to 'give' the song to the youngster if he can be \\"busted out\\" and returned to his Mississippi home, the pair are soon on a cross-country odyssey, with Martone learning about discrimination, the darker side of humanity, and love's loss (through a brief encounter with Jami Gertz, who was never lovelier), providing him with the core of sadness Brown says is essential to truly play the Blues.<br /><br />The climax of the film is legendary; arriving home, Brown, who had 'sold his soul' to the Devil at the 'Crossroads' as a young man (just as his friend, Johnson, had), attempts to get 'Scratch' (skeletal Robert Judd) to tear up the contract. The Devil informs him that he will, only if Martone can defeat his Champion in a 'Guitar Duel'. If the youngster loses, his soul, as well as Brown's, will be lost, forever. Martone rashly agrees (\\"I don't believe any of this s*** anyway!\\"), and he and Brown find themselves in a broken-down church converted into a dance hall, with demons and lost souls cavorting to the rock strains of insanely talented Jack Butler (Frank Zappa guitarist/composer Steve Vai). With only his love of the Blues, Julliard training, and Brown's 'ju-ju' to aid him, the humbled Martone must play for far more than his life, in a 'Duel' (with the amazing Vai actually playing both guitar parts) that is so fabulous that it is unbelievable that it was NOT included in the soundtrack album of the film!<br /><br />Walter Hill was no stranger to music-themed fantasies (he also directed another 'ahead of it's time' cult film, STREETS OF FIRE), and with CROSSROADS, he took a simple storyline, and turned it into an unforgettable musical cinematic experience.<br /><br />That the film is FINALLY on DVD is a MAJOR cause for celebration...now, let's hope an expanded \\"Special Edition\\" with added bonus features, will follow!t, forever.

B0002KQNL8|4.0|I wouldn't necessarily consider this to be a horror movie. More of a dark comedy if you ask me. It does have it's scary moments though. It also does bring back the legendary tar-man once again. The plot is a young kid and the local bullies go down to the local sewage pipe only to discover that the corpses from the first episode have been canned and placed in the pipe. Curiously the two bullies open one of the cases only to be sprayed with toxic gas and release the tar-man. The three run home and later the young kid goes back for a closer look at what it was, and stumbles upon our beloved friend tar-man up and about along with a few of his buddies. So the toxic gas finds it's way to the local cemetary and memorial house where a couple of grave robbers plan on cutting off corpses heads to make a quick buck to the right collector (Now who in the world would wanna by a nasty head?!)and are caught in the middle of this ordeal. Meanwhile the boy and his family and a pair of highschool swathearts notice something weird is going on when the weather suddenly changes (and the fact that corpses are coming out of the ground). Well anyway, you can figure out what happens from there. It's an all around good movie that will have you laughing and screaming! A good compromise for those of you who quarell about what movie to watch on halloween. See the Critters series and the origonal Return of the Living Dead if you liked this one.
B00006AULI|5.0|Session 9 is the type of horror movie that does not rely on special-effects, giant celebrities, or tons of undeserved press to make it popular and scary. It is psychological, it never got very big, and it should have. People who say this movie isn't in the same league as \\"the Sixth Sense\\" or \\"the Ring\\" are right.. this movie is actually SCARY.<br /><br />As mentioned before, the location where this was shot is really ominous and cool. There are a lot of really sinister shots in the movie that have stayed with me afterwards... the wheelchair... the photos... the tunnel in which the boy, Jeff, finds himself in at one point... the imagery in this movie is amazing and haunting.<br /><br />Also mentioned before is the use of music and sound effects. To me, one of the most disturbing parts of the movie was the audio from the session tapes that plays over the action. The tapes are old, and warped. Listening to the different voices on the session tapes as they play and become garbled in points is chilling.<br /><br />The acting is great as well. I also found the characters likeable and believable. The use of a dangerous-materials-removal crew I found interesting and different. There are no primping, preening Hollywood pinup boys here. Just a bunch of guys, and they are extraordinarily NORMAL.<br /><br />All this said, Session 9 scared me. I live in a basement apartment and after watching this movie, I felt very uncomfortable with my choice of living spaces (it being 4 AM at the time.) The Blair Witch Project also scared the hell out of me, and I hear that people either love it or hate it. I think Session 9 appeals and frightens in the same way, to the same type of people, that Blair Witch does. It is a movie that you will think about and discuss afterwards. And it is definitely scary. The ending left me completely nervous and unsettled. \\"The weak and the wounded....\\" it was sad and sickening and heartwrenching all at once.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. :)
B00005JN4O|5.0|Obviously I haven't seen this movie yet, afterall it is Sept. 10, 2004 and this movie comes out Nov. 12, 2004.  But I have seen the preview!  This movie will be amazing without a doubt.  John Depp is the perfect choice for an eccentric writter who is having problems writtinga great play.  Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman... this cast is just great.  Seeing Johnny Depp in a pirate uniform reminds of POTC.  This movie will be great for Peter Pan fans everywhere. <br /> <br />\\"It is the story of a boy who stays young forever\\"
B000069CWE|3.0|I'm not saying this because im a linkin park hater. They're actually my favorite band(tied with AC/DC). It may just be because im not a huge fan of the type of music on Reanimation.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love, love Christina. Her voice is great and she is hot! Every song is amazing 5+. My #1 favorite song is \\"voice within\\".
B00005JMX6|4.0|The critics ripped it up, and obviously many watchers missed the point.  Though it is no Risky Business as many have stated I throughly enjoyed the movie.  For anyone that grew up with the 80's classic High school comedies should enjoy it. Not enough substance? It's a comedy guys. It's to made to make you laugh, and bring back those long lost thoughts, and feelings of a coming of age high schooler regardless of what side of the fence you were on.
B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl Crow is definitely not an original. She is a great imitator. Techinically this album does everything right, but like usual with any Sheryl Crow CD, it does not make you feel. I like her choice of heros-Henley, Nicks, Harris, but she is not yet in their class.

6305558167|4.0|Back in the day, John Boorman wanted to make a live-action version of the Lord of the Rings but could not get the rights. Instead he made a similar movie and with a lot more seriousness than any incarnation before or after it.<br /><br />Excalibur is filled with sex, violence, incest and nudity. Trouble is none of it seems magical. Yes, Merlin is in there (played by Nicol Williamson) but he's more of a wild eccentric than the Dumbledore figure he more widely known as. He does magic, but most of it is not important to the plot.<br /><br />Uther Pendragon is played with viciousness by Gabriel Byrne, looking a bit harder than I'm used to and Helen Mirren pops up as Morgana, which was a bit of sly casting on John Boorman's part as Mirren and Williamson hated each other. My main problem is the guy who plays Arthur. He just doesn't look right, or noble or brave. I suppose this was supposed to be a contrast between him and the dashingness of Sir Lancelot but he does look a bit too much like Lenny from The Simpsons. Liam Neeson also has a smaller role as one of Arthur's knights as does Patrick Stewart (with hair!) as Leondegras.<br /><br />In the end it does follow the same old story with the same old ending but the journey is different and more adult. Though it still puzzles me why the Knights of the Round Table show up for their meetings wearing full armor and appear to search for the Holy Grail in Britain when they should be searching in somewhere like Israel.<br /><br />Unlike his score to Merlin in 1998, Trevor's Jones' score to Excalibur is serious and sparse. There's not much going on other than rumblings and the occasional blast on brass. Meh! It works, but not as magical as his later fantasy work in The Dark Crystal and Merlin.<br /><br />The DVD is 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The R2 DVD features a better cover art and also comes in a sturdy keepcase than a crappy old snapper. Pick up cheap or wait for a Special Edition.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV is the quintessential classic rock album. It listens like the sacred book of song. Black Dog kicks off the album with an evil blast of blues rock. Page is firing on all cylinders with severe riffs that envelop the listener. Rock and Roll is an anthem. I can't believe they sold it to Cadillac for their damn car commercials...nevertheless it is a hard rocker that keeps the album going full throtle. From here we downshift to The Battle of Evermore, one of the most haunting Led Zeppelin songs that is heavy and beautiful in its own right. Robert Plant's vocals dominate the song and leave you speechless. Battle of Evermore is one of the best songs Led Zeppelin ever recorded. Stairway to Heaven is probably the most recognized song of the past 30 years. Yes, it is a great song with fantastic structure, lyrics and musicianship. It's just ashamed that this song was so relentlessly overplayed, still it remains one the best rock songs ever recorded. Now here's where the record gets interesting...the second side of Zoso is simply amazing starting with Misty Mountain Hop, a straightforward rocker that gets the blood boiling again. Four Sticks follows and tears up the listeners ear drums. This is Bonham's track as he completely dominates. Four Sticks is one of the heaviest songs Led Zeppelin ever laid down and it's among their best. Going to California is a soft ballad where Jimmy Page's gorgeous guitar playing overwhelms and enchants the listener. This is truly a beautiful song. Which leaves When the Levee Breaks, I've never heard a bass drum as deep and powerful as the one that rocks this song. John Bonham's drums sound as if they were being pounded with sledgehammers. This song is another Zeppelin classic. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how important John Paul Jones' presence is on Led Zeppelin IV. His precision bass playing nails the groove to the floor on every track. He was the true backbone of Led Zeppelin and often overlooked. Simply put Led Zeppelin IV is among the top five rock albums ever recorded. It should be in any self respecting classic rock fans collection. Highest Recommendation.is among the top five rock albums ever recorded. It should be in any self respecting classic rock fans collection. Highest Recommendation.
0316172324|4.0|I was lucky enough to get a chance to snag an advance readers copy of this at a bookshow this summer and I recommend it highly. I am back here looking for it because when I looked at the .pdf of CBS News's documents re: Bush's National Guard problems, I immediately thought they looked funny. It's too bad this hasn't yet been released as I write this because I think the docs will turn out to be forged and it's a perfect example of \\"Blink\\" that people all over recognized that they were most likely created in MS Word.
B000002JSN|5.0|...is what the graffiti would read. Not only were they here but they dominated. The kings of classic rock further cemented their status as rock gods with the double album Physical Graffiti. If ever there was a flawless double album this is it. The first disc is flawless, beginning with the hard rocker Custard Pie. Page comes up with a simplified blues riff that invigorates the listener. The Rover is one of the best balls out rock anthems that Zep ever produced with Page once again taking over. Which leads to the centerpiece of the album, In My Time of Dying which is the best song Led Zeppelin ever produced. Houses of the Holy, Trampled Under Foot and the epic Kashmir round out a stellar first disc which rivals any Led Zeppelin album. The second disc begins with In the Light a great song that segways into Bron-Yr-Aur where Jimmy Page lights it up again. Down by the Seaside is a great mellow tune that grows on you after multiple listens. Ten Years Gone rivals the best Led Zeppelin songs ever produced. It simply has everything, great vocals from Plant, Page's unmatched guitar prowess, John Paul Jones amazing bass playing and Bonham's sledgehammer drumming. Page's solos on Ten Years Gone continue to be some the best guitar playing i've ever heard. Night Flight and the Wanton Song totally bring the listener back up. Wanton Song is one of the heavier songs that Zeppelin did and Bonham's drumming anchors this amazing track. Night Flight was rumored to have been produced during the Zoso album but left off. I'm glad because it fits in much better here. Boogie with Stu, Black Country Woman and Sick Again round out the second disc. Physical Graffiti is a well-balanced attack of sonic booms and lulls that will cry out for repeated listens. Bottom Line: behind The Beatles White Album, Pink Floyd's The Wall and The Who's Tommy; Physical Graffiti is the best double album ever produced. Highly Recommended.
B00005JNEI|5.0|In the last two days I have watched \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" two times.<br /><br />I wish that I could say that 90% of this film is nothing more than crap. But I can not say that.<br /><br />I do know that what was suggested to me was that MONEY RULES the world. The rich keep the poor exactly where they want them. And there is a balance that must be struck. Oh it is ok if a few slip through and make it up to the big time. They are not a threat. They always join the club and quickly forget where they came from.<br /><br />I guess my being raised in an orphanage and being treated like a piece of crap, for many years, has made me aware of what the rich can do to those living below their standards.<br /><br />Could what happened in Russia, Iraq and Germany, as well as many other countries in the world ever happen here in America? Of course it could. The citizens of those countries thought it could never happen there either. One day they woke up and the monster had appeared it's ugly head. By then it was to late for the common-man to do anything about it.<br /><br />POWER is a strange creature. It makes men very greedy and very selfish. Some in high places think that power gives them permission to steal, cheat, lie and even kill.<br /><br />Are there no common-men, or women, who are not wealthly, who are smart enough to serve in the Congress or the Senate? If so, where are they? Why is it that the rich always seem to grab power in almost every country in the world?<br /><br />What are the chances that any one family can be smart enough to have two Congressmen, or two Senators, a Governor or even two Presidents come from the same family? How is that possible? It is possible because of money and power. Of course it is...It happens in both political parties. And it will happen in a third party should one ever be formed.<br /><br />The film to me is not about what is TRUE or FALSE. It is about what could possibly become TRUTH if power is not kept in check. And if it does happen it will be because we did it to ourselves. One day your brother, or your sister might rise up against you. If and when they do; it will be because it is the only way that they can save themselves. This has happened many times in the course of history.<br /><br />One must look far beyond the film itself.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder when I watch television and see Hilter speaking to the massive german crowds.

B00001QEE7|5.0|This has been a favorite movie of mine since my childhood. It is the first Disney movie that I remember watching over and over again, during the weekends when I had nothing else to do. Recently, I decided to watch the movie again, and it still has that same effect on me after all these years. <br /> <br />The story centers on a mermaid living under the sea in the Kingdom of Atlantica named Ariel. She is the youngest daughter of King Triton, and has a fascination for the human world above the sea. She collects various antiques with her friend Flounder, and frequently goes above sea level to talk to Skuttle (a seagull who tells her about humans), even though her father forbids her from doing so. Soon, her falls in love with Prince Eric, a human, but when her father discovers this, he makes it clear that she will never be allowed to meet the human. Ariel is willing to do anything to meet Eric, even if it means wandering off to the evil Sea witch, Ursula to become a human. <br />  <br />Ron Clements and John Musker, the directors of this movie and also other Disney classics like Aladdin and Hercules, beautifully portray the story of Ariel in `The Little Mermaid'. The cast for providing voices to the characters also did a good job. Jodi Benson (who gives voices for many characters in Disney) did very well for the voice of Ariel, as did Samuel Wright for Sebastian along with Pat Carroll for the voice for Ursula. However, most of the credit goes to Alan Menken for composing a wonderful score to the movie, and teaming up with the late Howard Ashman to create some catchy and moving songs, that add well to the story. From listening to the songs in the movie, it is not surprising that this one the Academy Award for Best Score and also and Award for Best Song `Under the Sea'. <br /> <br />The only disappointing feature is the video presentation on this DVD. Some of the scenes still appear a little grainy and blurry. If you want a lot of features, I suggest you want till the Platinum series of this edition releases, consisting with a 2-disk set, filled with features is compared to this edition. <br /> <br />This is one of the best movies that Disney has created, and stands on top of the list along with `Beauty and the Beast' and `Aladdin'. This is a true masterpiece which can be enjoyed by all ages.  <br />
B00002MZ12|5.0|As a 40-something man, I didn't expect to like this CD this much. What an original singer.  Alanis has her own style and nobody can come close to copying it. She is brilliant, and I'm sure her searching lyrics speak to the hearts of millions. Some language may be offensive, she doesn't hold back on bluntness and direct messages.
B00008O31H|5.0|The Black Keys are not your average blues band. They are made up of two white guys from Akron, Ohio. Do not let that fool you though. These guys got soul. Guitar and drums are the only instruments, and with the sound they have, they do not need anything more. The music is pure, gritty, energy. The album sounds like it was recorded in a garage. It is a thirty-eight minute assault on the ears, in a good way. <br /> <br />The twenty-two-year-old singer has the voice of a forty-year-old straight out of Mississippi. He has the moan of a man that has seen nothing but heartbreak and hard liquor. The drumming is genius in its simplicity and the guitar sounds broken down and grungy. It is the essence of the blues genre. It is good to see a band like this bringing back the blues. The blues seems to be a forgotten genre in music today and the Keys are definitely opening some eyes.  <br /> <br />The Black Keys have been compared to The White Stripes, but they have a completely different sound, and in my opinion, a better sound. The only similarity that The Black Keys have with The White Stripes is that they are both two piece bands, and that they have colors in their names.  <br /> <br />If you are looking to branch out from the popular bands like the White Stripes and you like the sound of guitar and drums, I suggest The Black Keys. If you want to start listening to blues music but do not know where to start, I suggest The Black Keys. They are like a gateway drug into the world of the blues.  <br /> <br />The album is made up of songs you would expect to hear in a dive bar. Smoke-filled, packed with drunks, and Thickfreakness on the jukebox. That is where you picture yourself when listening to this CD. It features a great remake of the blues classic \\"Have Love, Will Travel\\" that will blow some minds. If you doubt their blues ability, this one song will change your view on its own. Also, the title track is a great way to open the disc. It explodes right away and oozes with theblues-rock feel that is present throughout the album. It makes you want to continue listening to see what these guys are all about. It has great guitar work and a solid drum beat along with lyrics that are so slurred they do not sound like words at all, but it all adds to the vibe and the greatness that is The Black Keys. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for a new band that does not sound new, look into The Black Keys. If you are looking for an album to listen to at a party, listen to Thickfreakness. If you are looking for an album to listen to by yourself and just relax to, Thickfreakness is good for that too. It is a great album all around for any mood. The Black Keys are an original band without being in your face with their originality. They brought back a genre that has faded away from the music scene today and I commend them for that. This may be the beginning of a \\"Blues Revolution\\", so check The Keys out before the explosion begins. <br />

I was surfing the net, looking at movies to check out, reading reviews, when I decided to look at this beautiful set. It had add to cart! It was there early, everywhere else I looked it was on pre-order. So I got it before it came out, it arrived, and it rocks. I have not actually watched any of them yet, except the U.S. theatrical version because I had it on the divimax version. But anyway, I can't wait to see the extended version and especially cannot wait for Dario Argento the scary as hell director's cut. If you have ever seen Suspiria or Deep Red you will know what I mean by scary as hell. Anyway, now it is out everywhere, but I have it in my room, unopened, ready to watch. Of course, a movie of this greatness deserves no less of a dvd set. Now just make a terrific dvd set for the ORIGINAL Halloween and The Funhouse, put tons of extras, and that would be rad.
B000002ILG|5.0|For fans of great guitar solos and great rock anthems, \\"Pride\\" should definetly be in your collection. From start to finish, you feel the chemistry of this band that really seems to work together so great. Mike Tramps raspy voice really sounds well with Vitos remarkable heart felt guitar playing. \\"Lady of the Valley\\", \\"All you need is Rock N Roll\\", \\"Tell me\\" and ofcourse the 2 monster songs \\"Wait\\" and \\"When the Children Cry\\" are really worth having a copy of this time capsule, that captures the great rock bands of the 80's. To go back to a time when amazing solos and passion were the priority in songs. A solid album that will not let you down.

I love those songs! They are the best on the cd, but all the songs are good!
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Historians are sharply divided on the question of whether or not the Trojan War actually occurred - and if it did, which archaeological site is actually Troy. Discoveries made at the beginning of the 21st century provide new evidence of several armed battles in the right area at the right time - but definitive proof is hard to find, due largely to the historical practice of constructing one city on the ruins of another. Homer's Illiad (and other similar epics depicting the Trojan War) were written hundreds of years after the Trojan War supposedly occurred, and are of little use in determining factual historical events as they included many mythological elements: gods such as Apollo, Zeus, and Hera were central characters in the story who drastically affected the course of the war by killing and/or saving individual people during the conflict. The producers' decision to eliminate all mythological elements from the story gives their film an air of historical authenticity not present in the original works. The best epic in decades.  <br />
B000002I7H|5.0|I have to confess, I stumbled upun this album by pure chance, without knowing anything about Albert King.  After listening to the first track I was quite impressed - and as I kept listening, the music kept getting better.  If you like electric blues, or for that matter any blues or blues-rock, get this album.  My favorites from the album are \\"funk-shun\\" and \\"the hunter\\" but (with only a couple expections), all the songs are great.
B000002NBY|5.0|Pop writing doesn't get any better than this.  Arranging and producing doesn't get any better than this. Simon's weary voice floats over every song with precision and charm.<br /><br />This album is smart and every song is a gem.  Paul Simon for over 20 years was the best at merging art with commerce in the music industry.  And this album is the best thing he ever did. A magnificent achievement, it is pure genius.

B00008O31H|3.0|Some of the songs are strong enough to convince and be exciting, but their spontaneousness doesn't always serve the music and sometimes seems to be a cover-up for their shortcomings.  <br />The basic line-up can have its charme and often adds to the roughness of this uncompromising  Bluesrock, but in some cases I surely missed the presence of some extra instruments, like in Have Love, Will Travel which remains too much of a promise this way.
B00005JGAF|5.0|This was the Ramones third album, and the last with Tommy behind the drum kit.  It also happens to be their best album.  The album features one classic song after another.  As a side note, this album features all three of the group's singles that actually made the pop charts (\\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\", \\"Rockaway Beach\\" and \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\").  Besides those three songs, the album also has fan favorites like \\"Cretin Hop\\", \\"We're a Happy Family\\", \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" and \\"Surfin' Bird\\".  This is the greatest punk album of all time.  Highly recommended.
B00009AOBI|3.0|I just purchased this DVD again \\"The Directors Cut\\"although the added scenes and the Peter Bogdanovich interview are fantastic Bruce Springsteen replacing Bob Seger as the core sountrack singer SUCKS!!!!Bob Seger added punch,drive,and a helluva lot more emotion.Springsteen playing in the background is only an annoyance.I like Springsteen but Seger Belongs on this film....I'll watch this latest DVD edition for the extras(scenes&interview)but for a night at the movies..It'll most certainly be Me,Cher,and BOB SEGER!
B00005JN2X|5.0|I really enjoyed Collateral. Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he  kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all \\"bad people\\" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays this evil character with alot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil.  Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.<br /><br />Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.<br /><br />I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie. His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was one the best I have seen on televisiion in a long time, and, of course, FOX canceled it before it got a chance to gain much of an audience.  \\"Firefly\\" was an excellect example of Joss Whedon's talent and ability.  He has an interesting balance in the different members of the crew of Serenity and their relationships with each other are what the show is really about.  The backdrop of a future where humans have reverted to living a lot like they did in the wild west is just what will draw both sci-fi fantasy fans and those who enjoy good drama.  But the acting and directing will maintain their interest in the show.  Personally, I can't wait until \\"Serenity\\" the movie comes out.  I'm sure Fox is kicking themselves right now!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|This live cd is great!!  I am a lover of live music and this concert is on point!! I listen to some of the songs AT LEAST twice a day!!  No joke!!!  You won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|Can you guess what my opinion is of this CD?  <br /> <br />OK, I am not going to be overly pretentious in this review. I just want to simply state that the music on this disc reaches me in a way very few of the newer bands on the scene have. It's the kind of stuff I can listen to over and over and not get bored with. I love Amy's vocals, and I love the guitar sounds as well. catsomfaw said something in their review about being able to relax to it. I agree. But at the same time there is enough energy here that I have been using it during my workout routine as well!  <br /> <br />Here's the thing I really wanted to say. I have been in a band. I was the drummer. We wrote all of our own songs and it was a very collaborative effort. I have no memories, in 6 years of writing and playing that music, of anyone ever saying they needed to \\"let more light shine through\\", or really anything with that much  forethought. What would happen is that someone has an idea for a song, and they bring it to the band. Or, more often then not, the song is born out of the spontaneous jam sessions we used to do during rehearsals just for kicks.  <br /> <br />We would have an absolute blast playing the stuff together, then if we thought there was something worth keeping we would start tweaking things until we got something we liked. What we DIDN'T do was write music for \\"other\\" people. We wrote and played what we enjoyed listening to. And THAT was the basis of our sound. Evanescence does the same thing I am sure. They write what is in their hearts. And, they have found that others want to hear it. THIS above all else is what marks them as a band I want to hear more from.  <br /> <br />So, really...do yourself a favor. Don't pay too much attention to what other people are saying about the Vocals, or the Guitar sound etc. Decide for yourself if their music is to your taste. I am SURE you can find ways to sample it before you decide to buy. But even if you risk buying it before you listen, if youdon't like it there are lots of ways to get your money back!  <br />

0714834491|5.0|Sometimes I am tempted to take a few days off from work and attempt to read \\"The Art of Looking Sideways\\" from cover to cover. Then I remind myself that I have my whole lifetime to enjoy it. I think of it as my encyclopedia of inspiration. An incredibly extensive collection of facts, quotes, images, anecdotes, concepts... anything a designer needs to get the gears turning and the ideas flowing. I would recommend it to anyone who desires a creative boost. I promise, it hasn't failed me yet.
B000002N1E|4.0|ill give a reveiw of each individual track <br /> <br />1.p.control (one of princes best raps of the 90's) <br /> <br />2.endorphinmachine (quite loud and in your face the tunes ok i suppose but not one of the best) <br /> <br />3.shhh (nice and cool r'n'b style song, but not one of my faves) <br /> <br />4.we march (pretty cool song, i like it and i like the beat) <br /> <br />5.the most beutiful girl in the world (one of princes all time biggest hits, its a bit to girly for my tastes but its ok) <br /> <br />6.dolphin (i didn't like it at first but give it a chance and ittl grow on you in time) <br /> <br />7.now (one of my faves off the album, i love the beat, the tune, the lyrics its a very cool song) <br /> <br />8.319 (i dont like this one) <br /> <br />9.shy (nice, this one is much better than the previous) <br /> <br />10.billy jack bitch (avarage) <br /> <br />11.i hate you (one of the best, a great ballad) <br /> <br />12.gold (a fantastic song, absaloute genious!)
B00024BHTC|4.0|Nightwish is out to get you with an even deadlier arsenal than before. They have come a long way; comparing their first album with this one will immediatly reveal many obvious differences; the voice, the sound and their latest addition: the orchestra! They seem to have abandoned their days of the keyboard and are now digging into a more instrumental, even more symphonic style. And it's all for the best! <br /> <br />This album starts off with pure rage before Tarja's happy singing kicks in, and she does do a fine job on this record! I'd say her voice is better than in any other album, although she sounds a bit more... Girly. As the tracks skip and we go over to 'Wish I had an Angel', we feel some speed, and the album is just beginning to bloom. 'Nemo', however poppy it felt at first, was the song I had been waiting for for a while. Catchy, melodic, great singing and a song that I can listen for hours. From here, more instrumental parts are added, with longer tracks such as 'Creek Mary's Blood' and 'Ghost Love Score' showing off the orchestra. Especially 'Ghost Love Score' is a song that will remain burned in my head for a long time to come, the brilliance of it! Songs that stand out on this album to me are 'Nemo', 'Dead Gardens', 'Ghost Love Score' and 'Higher than Hope'.  <br /> <br />However, after a while, I started finding myself skipping tracks. This is probably one of the weaker points of the record; some of them become tiresome and with less repeating and more trumpet blazing a little flaw showed itself to me. But perhaps this is just my own discontentness and impatience! <br /> <br />If you have listened to Nightwish for a long time and still haven't bought this, get it now! This is also a great introduction to Nightwish. Enjoy!!
B000002B7U|5.0|The ultimate sin is IMO, the best Ozzy album, the guitar work by Jake E lee is very strong (nothing to envy Randy Rhoads) and the songs are the best songs from Ozzy's career.  I'm not a huge fan of Ozzy but this record is the only one of the career of Mr. Osbourne that has a spot in my all time favorite albums.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album is definetely, along with 'Back in Black' one of the best Rock albums of all time, and I don't mean to overrate this collection of 10 tracks of pure Rock & Roll. With singer Bon Scott making his last record before his death the following year, 'Highway to Hell' burst out a spate of Rock anthems such as the title track, \\"Touch Too Much,\\"Beating Around the Bush,\\"If You Want Blood,\\" and the rest are just as great to make the whole album a worth listening without skipping a single song from start to end.  Get this album and if you want a taste of the best classic R&R that's ever been recorded.
B000002LSV|4.0|This is one good hard rock album. From their bluesy, cowboy-like days in the 1970's to their sleek 80's sound, this collection has it all. It even includes a remake of Elvis Presley's 'Viva Las Vagas'. This trio  is one of the best raw hard rock bands, and it would be next to impossible to fit all their classics on one album, but this album does really the best you can do. If you like 70's rock or 80's rock, get this album.
B0000062FN|5.0|No doubt about it, this is the best hour of music that Santana has ever put on record. Teaming up with Neal Schon before he and keyboardist Gregg Rolie left the band to form Journey, Carlos and the formidable percussion trio of \\"Chepito\\" Arias, Michael Carabello, and Michael Shrieve, and Santana's long-time bassist David Brown, the band take  the Latin-Rock revolution spearheaded in 'Santana I' and 'Abraxas' to astronomic heights.  <br /> <br />The album opens 'Batuka,' with a timbales groove that later is picked up by two alternating guitars that undergo a crescendo in volume and intensity, eventually incorporating the ingredients that makes the salsa hot throughout the rest of the track, with Carlos, Rolie and Schon interchanging notes in a dialogue-type instrumentation complemented by the percussion virtuosity that resembles the formula used in other tracks such as 'Touissaint L'Overture' and 'Jungle Strut.'  <br /> <br />To some extent, the classic \\"Not One to Depend on\\" is pretty similar to \\"Evil Ways\\" as featured in 'Santana I,' but this time Schon's aggressive guitar solo is more flowing and Rock-oriented than the more percussive solo of Carlos in 'Evil Ways.' <br /> <br />Carlos lead playing stands out in 'Guajira,' which also features a Latin-Jazz piano session that proyects the band's Afro-Caribbean roots. <br /> <br />'Santana III' remains a true musical artwork that hopefully would make Carlos and the Band return to its early passion for musical      mastership and walk away from the path of mediocrity as shown in Santana's last two commercial releases
B0001EFTVA|5.0|With such films as \\"Perfect Blue,\\" \\"Millennium Actress\\" and now \\"Tokyo Godfathers, \\" Kon Satoshi has rapidly ascended to the ranks of the masters of animation in Japan, side by side with such dignitaries as Miyazaki Hayao, Takahata Isao, Otomo Katsuhiro and Oshii Mamoru.<br /><br />Like his other films, \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" takes place in modern Japan and part of the joy of the film is seeing the wonderland of Tokyo come alive in vivid animated splendor.  To achieve this particular look, Kon filmed live scenes of Tokyo, then animated overtop of the backgrounds, to give his characters a completely realistic environment in which to live their fantasy.  The overall effect is really amazing.<br /><br />The characters are three homeless people, each with a hidden background of severe pain that buries their proverbial hearts of gold.  They form a strange, nomadic family, with Gin, a decade-long veteran of the Tokyo streets with a sad and mysterious past,  Hana, a slightly pathetic aging drag queen who wants to play the role of mother to the odd clan, and Miyuki, a hard, aggressive teenager who isn't quite sure about the decisions that lead her to this life.  Add to that Kiyoko, a foundling baby abandoned in a sack of garbage and discovered on Christmas eve, and the family is complete.<br /><br />As with \\"Millennium Actress,\\"  Kon effectively weaves together several stories into an complete picture, each thread joining together briefly as it touches the lives of one of the three characters, then separating as they part.  However, in the world of \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" there are almost no strangers, and each person met along the path contributes something to the Christmas miracle of Kiyoko.<br /><br />\\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" is very touching and sentimental, as a proper Christmas movie should be.  But it is the sentiment and love won through hardships and pain, and the film does not lack for an edge.  And then there are miracles, and wonder.<br /><br />A really excellent movie altogether.  It would be a shame if more people didn't get the chance to see it.ovie altogether.  It would be a shame if more people didn't get the chance to see it.
B000089RV6|5.0|With today's Rock music distancing more and more from its roots in the new era of sampled music and souless guitar playing, \\"Back in Black\\" offers a refuge for those who miss the ol' days of blues-based riffs from one of the best guitar duos in Rock & Roll and the vocals of then new singer Brian Johnson thundering through your stereo. Every single song on this CD is worth the purchase, the title track has what is arguably the most emblemic guitar riff in the history of R&R music, and Johnson shows he could take the lyrics and his voice to the levels of the Bon Scott's years. In my opinion \\"Back in Black\\" is along with Van halen first album the bridge of 70s Heavy metal and 80s guitar shred craze that was to take over in the glorious last decade of  rock guitar soloes. Simply put, get this album NOW! <br />
B00005R87Q|3.0|\\"The Fast And The Furious\\" is obviously a guilty pleasure. The movie has amazing cars, attractive women (Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster), corny dialogues, summer movie visual stunts, bad actors (Vin Diesel) and a MTV2 movie soundtrack. But the funny thing is that the movie works despite all that (or perhaps because all that).    \\"The Fast And The Furious\\" is an amusing movie because the director and cast never pretended to be part of a groundbreaking film, they knew that they were filming a popcorn movie, so they enjoyed the whole process, and the result is evident, \\"The Fast And The Furious\\" is an entertaining movie.    Of course, this kind of trick only works once, but Hollywood doesn't care, the studios love to repeat successful formulas, even if they know that they are going to release a bad movie, they know also that it's going to do well in the box office. So Hollywood made a sequel, \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\", but obviously that movie is just average or below average. This kind of formulas (cars + visual effects + attractive women) only work once.    Anyway, \\"The Fast And The Furious\\" is an amusing, entertaining film. Rent it first, and if you don't like it that much, at least you will have a good time for two hours.
B000003C4K|5.0|If you want to hear 80's metal the way Metallica intended it to sound before they got all posed up and mainstream, listen to this album. Baloff's vocals are perfect. Exactly the way they should sound. Angry music deserves an angry vocalist. If that doesn't do it for you, go on and peg your jeans and brush the dust off of your Winger collection. If you still find fault with Baloff, just remember....he's a metal legend and you're not.
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill's fourth album, The Years Of Decay (1989), is by far their best album. For starters, Overkill are one of the greatest thrash bands ever, and over the years, they have stayed true to their original style, which is always a good thing. This album is punishingly heavy, and it features some of the best thrash songs ever written. First off, one of the key parts of this album is the musicianship, which has notably evolved over the years. Vocalist Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth is freakin' crazy, I wish that the band I'm in, which is yet to be named, could have a singer like him. Guitarist Bobby Gustafson is insane, he can shred like nobody's business, and he can also blast out some great melody solos. Bassist D.D. Verni is awesome, one of the better thrash bassists, but no Cliff Burton. Drummer Sid Falk rocks, he can play super fast or moderately slow.<br /><br />Now, the tunes on the album:<br /><br />1. \\"Time To Kill\\"; Starts off a bit slow, but turns into another punishing opener, which is what thrash albums should always have.<br /><br />2. \\"Elimination\\"; Definetely my favorite song on the album, the first time I heard it, I almost snapped my neck.<br /><br />3. \\"I Hate\\"; Boy, if there was ever a song to play when you want to rip someone's head off, this is it!<br /><br />4. \\"Nothing To Die For\\"; Another brutal one, always good. Killer solo.<br /><br />5. \\"Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher\\"; Perhaps if this song were a bit faster, it might not be my least favorite track on the album, but it still is great, and it does speed up quite a bit in the middle. Basically, an epic dirge.<br /><br />6. \\"Birth Of Tension\\"; Another song that is useful when you want to rip someone's head off.<br /><br />7. \\"Who Tends The Fire\\"; Overall, it almost sounds like the classic Metallica instrumental \\"Orion\\" with vocals mixed in. Very cool.<br /><br />8. \\"The Years Of Decay\\"; Interesting tune: an opening very reminiscent of Queensryche, and then in the middle it has a brutal breakdown, then finishes the way it began.<br /><br />9. \\"E.Vil N.Ever D.Ies\\"; Ha, get it? E.N.D.! And a great one at that!<br /><br />This is an incredible album, check it out if you like any of Overkill's other albums, or other thrash bands, like old Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Pantera, Megadeth, Voivod, Flotsam And Jetsam, S.O.D., Forbidden, Testament, Exodus, Dark Angel, Atrophy...well, you get it. Also, if you go to Metal-Rules.com, you'll notice that on their list of the top 100 metal albums of all time, this one is number 77. Overall, that seems lackluster at first glance, but when you think about the fact that there have been thousands upon thousands of metal albums, that's extremely good. Rock on, fellow headbangers! \m/breakdown, then finishes the way it began. <br /> <br />9. \\"E.Vil N.Ever D.Ies\\"; Ha, get it? E.N.D.!

B00000ADG2|4.0|This is undoubtedly the best hip hop album of all time! <br /> <br />Top Songs: <br /> <br />Lost Ones- Hardcore rap....so catchy and yet so true...lyrics are amazing, as they are in all of the songs. 10/10 <br /> <br />Ex Factor- My favorite...Is a smooth ballad that shows Hill's vocal range. 10/10 <br /> <br />To Zion- My second fav. Its about the struggles and pressures from her friends for her to get an abortion. 10/10 <br /> <br />Doop Wop That Thing- Overhyped, but still catchy and genius. 9/10 <br /> <br />Superstar- It has a great meaning and all, but gets old after a while. 8/10 <br /> <br />Final Hour- Least Fav. 6/10 <br /> <br />When It Hurts So Bad- I love this! Amazing and unique. 9/10 <br /> <br />I Used To Love Him- Awesome duet with Mary J Blige...I personally feel Blige did a better job on this song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Forgive Them Father- I love this song! Enough said. 10/10 <br /> <br />Every Ghetto Every City- I love the lyrics....its like a brief autobiography. 10/10 <br /> <br />Nothing Even Matters- Pretty good 8/10 <br /> <br />Everything Is Everything- Very poetic 8/10 <br /> <br />The Miseduction of Lauryn Hill- Very beautiful! 10/10 I love the piano <br /> <br />Hidden Tracks are okay. <br />

6305127697|5.0|Before \\"The Practice\\", I hated courtroom drama movies, and this movie would have been no exception...However, I purchased this movie a few weeks ago and watched it for the first time last night, and all I can say is WOW!  I was never a big fan of Richard Gere, but I thought he was very good in \\"Unfaithful\\" and even more so in this movie...Some actors just get better with time, or sometimes choose the wrong parts that do not show their true potential as actors, but he came full circle in this movie..The Character named \\"Aaron\\" played by Ed Norton was superb!! I look foward to seeing him in more dramatic movies.  The ending of this movie was mind blowing.....I wish I could say more, but it would be definitely be a spoiler...Buy it, rent it, whatever, just see it!  You won't regret it!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I purchased this CD when it was still an import back in March, and honestly, it hasn't left my CD player since. Every track is a killer; I don't think it gets any better than this! I would recommend this to anyone, and I can guarantee that no matter who you are, you'll be dancing and singing along. And I don't even think I could choose a favorite from this album, as every song is equally as great as the last. An amazing debut from an amazing band. Go buy this. Now. You won't regret it.

B0002DB52M|5.0|Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier occupies the coveted and much-acclaimed/decried position of the auteur: the cinematic craftsman of visionary power. Von Trier's films, particularly the recent compositions of *Breaking the Waves* (1996) and *Dancer in the Dark* (2000), have astonished/infuriated both the avant-garde and mainstream audience: with their intricate meld of art-house technique (the infamous Dogme 95 movement) and emotional manipulation that, for some, reaches borderline-bathos, Von Trier's films compel the base instincts, inspire heated conversation...and most importantly, continue to build upon previous work, achieving new vistas of theme, ambition and overall `modus operandi.'      The cost of such vision is, apparently, quite exacting: Von demands much of his tools, and can be abusive to achieve his desired result.  After *Dancer in the Dark* Bjork announced she would never act again; Nicole Kidman, during press at Cannes, hinted at her personal struggle with Grace's character arc and the overall tone of *Dogville*.  Yet an uncompromising attitude often strains the best juice from the pulp, the end result being the important emphasis: whatever _works_.  And the end result here is like a thorn in the heart - it cannot be ignored.      *Dogville* is, in essence, a study of humanity at its most tribal-base, set within the modern-era microcosm of the small town.  Initially I was off-put by the theater setting: it seemed an awkward, pretentious device.  This sensation was augmented by the distracting lighting variations, which I initially took to be bad DVD transfer.  As the film progressed, however, the invisible walls came to serve story and theme, revealing the sordid hypocrisies seething beneath the tranquil faade.  Showy technique showed more than I anticipated; it was a conceit I came to admire.     A prologue introduces the audience to allegorical Dogville, rural USA epitomized.  Isolated from the world at large by a mountain range, the village consists of fourteen souls existing in relative harmony, the sort of apple-orchid haven not inconsistent with the Pastures and Valleys of Steinbeck's So Cal exegesis.  Secrets, sorrow and resentment ferment beneath the small town surface, but everyone knows their place, everyone tolerates to a greater or lesser extent the frailties of one another through virtue of long-term association.      But come the gloaming of one dusk evening, resident philosopher/artiste Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears gunfire in the distance, and his investigation reveals a beautiful damsel in distress, Grace (Nicole Kidman, in perhaps the most accomplished role of her career).  Tom is instantly smitten by the fur-coiffed, strawberry-blonde Grace; and she in turn throws her fate upon his mercy, revealing a frailty that, we later come to understand, is as much subconscious psychological _testing_ as it is immediate conscious need.  Grace's predicament, indeed her very presence, is viewed with some suspicion and consternation by the other Dogville residents: she is the seductive Apple in the Garden, foreign yet ultimately irresistible.    *Dogville* is a long film - two and half hours - with the first half devoted to the aesthetic construction of the community at large and the individual roles the town residents play in their fragile symbiosis. As the movie progresses Grace is accepted and comes to occupy a greater responsibility in the foundation-activities of the community, yet ever remains the outsider, the alien corn.  Exploitation emerges slowly, with doomed certainty, for Grace's charm, beauty and overall usefulness, coupled with her frail position, \\"plants seeds that must surely grow,\\" to paraphrase the justification of one offender.    The eventual climax/conclusion of *Dogville* comes as no surprise.  Von Trier illustrates the proverb of \\"Every Dog will Have it's Day\\" with a philosophical argument between Kidman and an unsurprising cameo about humanity in general - exposing and effectively condemning the pity-route of the Great White Guilt.  The result of stripped illusions cannot be shrugged off, the other cheek turned; under a bloody moon Grace transfigures herself from victim to jury/judge.  Some will perceive this entire segment, and the movie as a whole, as a misanthropic exercise of cynicism.  I, a survivor of small town USA xenophobia, am torn in my overall assessment: my social-theory recognition is marred with the evocation of ancient wish-fulfillment fantasy, augmented by an inescapable cinematic surge of Platonic justice - the visceral climatic need - as served with extreme prejudice.   But regardless of my own emotional impression, this remains a powerful film, a dark and demanding theatre of (in)humanity at its most base fragility.     Highly recommended.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|One thing that many people don't realize is that these movies are not very good by themselves, they work much better as a series.  I haven't bought each film individually, and now with the release of this great looking set, I'm glad I didn't.  Sets are really cool, if they're not expensive.  Not only does this set look great, it's not very expensive either.  For a person who isn't the biggest fan of the series, this one's on my must-buy list for this fall.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Are you kidding? <br /> <br />I was so looking forward to this release. I guess I will keep watching the worn out VHS copies I have of Star Wars. I don't know what this garbage is that's being issued on DVD, but it's not Star Wars.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The director of this movie definately didn't stick with the books, and that's made me as well as loads of other people unhappy. Very important information was taken out (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs!) and unneeded scenes were added in (the Gryffindor boys eating that candy and making animal noises - how was that important?!). I'm really upset with the director. Chris Columbus did a much better job. Hopefully the newest director won't mess it up for everyone again.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read, to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore, for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again, I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games, but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ.

1400032717|5.0|When a dog is found dead with a gardening tool stuck in its side, a dogged investigation by the novel's hero, John Boone, into who is responsible for this deed, leads to unexpected revelations.  John is an autistic 15 year old who lives with his father, and the story is told from his point of view.  John has extraordinary abilities, but certain things that seem obvious to the reader John has trouble comprehending.  And while some previous readers have been underwhelmed by the story and the ending, I feel they miss the point that the greatness of this novel is not the story, but the way it is told.  No, John is not a scintillating conversationalist, but you had to admire his determination to find out the culprit of this deed, and delve into his dysfunctional family's secrets  <br /> <br />Not only does it work as a story, but provides a lot of insights into the autistic mind.  Haddon has worked with autistic individuals, and weaves the unique perspectives of an autistic teenager into the story.  My son has been diagnosed with autism 6 months ago, I've done some reading and research into how he behaves, but this book fleshed out my understanding of some details of his behavior.  Previous reviewers have questioned the accuracy of the portrayal of an autistic teenager in this book, and my son is certainly different, but personally, I found useful information here.
B00029LNHS|1.0|I expected this would be a great CD since I knew of 3 songs I already liked (i.e. Hey Mama, Let's Get It Started, Where Is the Love?). However, every song except those three is crap. I would not waste the money to buy the whole CD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hey, all you Star Wars purists who can find nothing better to do than bash Lucas for these changes.....SHUT UP, ALREADY.  You people constantly complain that he's ruined \\"your\\" beloved trilogy by making even the slightest of alterations.  Notice my quotation marks around \\"your,\\"  because it's his trilogy, and it's his right to change it as he sees fit.  Granted, I too thought some of the changes, like the now infamous Greedo fiasco, were ludicrous, but my goodness, give it a break.  \\"Oh, no, Greedo shoots first,\\" or, \\"Oh, no, the antichrist himself, Hayden Christiansen, is at the end of Jedi, therefore these movies MUST be ruined now.\\"  Give me a break.  It's still the same Star Wars you know and loved and you know it.  To me, at least, these are still the same movies that I've loved all my life, and if you're telling me you'd actually rather watch the grainy, almost indecipherable original cuts, you've gotta be kidding.  I'd just like to know how many of you who say you're not buying it actually have it preordered by now.  Yeah, I know I sound harsh, but deal.
B00003CXCT|5.0|\\"Bring my Shuttle\\", fit Vader's personality.  \\"Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival\\", did not!  Wait a minute....maybe that was the good side in Vader that Luke was always referring to.  I finally see the logic in Lucas' change.  Hopefully though, he decided to switch back to the original dialogue for this DVD.  Regardless, the DVD should be very enjoyable.
B00005JNEI|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br />Just by reading some of the hysterical reaction to Michael Moore's work, you can see how important his work is. Michael Moore - much to the chagrin of some politicians and some of the people on this web page -  has carefully and methodically collected and verified a wide range of evidence that could completely change your view of the whole `War on Terrorism'.  <br /> <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent piece of journalism and research. It is a documentary presented in an intriguing and energetic style. At times, the work contains a touch of lightheartedness, but this is derived from the almost surreal actions of the government rather than any disrespect to the 9/11 victims. Indeed, Moore himself lost a colleague in the attack, and he documents the heart breaking loss of the mother of a dead US soldier. <br /> <br /> <br />Sure, Moore ironically resembles a politician at times, with plenty of slant and bias mixed in with his work. But the fact remains that the evidence is hard and solid. Moore reveals a series of remarkable and at times shocking facts about the US government's behavior up to, during, and after the tragic events of 9/11. <br /> <br />America (and my country, Britain) profess to be the `land of the free', a country that promotes freedom of speech and press. From seeing some of the people on this site you can see how important that is. You can bury your head in the sand and scream \\"Moore is a liar! It's not true!\\" or you can watch the documentary, check the evidence, review the facts, and decide for yourself.  <br />
0441009425|4.0|OK, I quite liked this book. It was very well written, and I value that. Mr. Reynolds weave as a complex a universe and tells a story as intricate and complex as any. The characters are quite well drawn, and the universe of revelaton space is interesting. I highly recommend it as a holiday, or airflight read. <br />The issue I had with the book is that there is very little really new in it. I recognize a bit of Clark, a bit of Vance, a bit of this and a bit of that. Reynolds is no Mieville. I do not think he aims to be one either though. He seems to be very aware of his sources of inspiration. Also, he blissfully avoids all childish sex that fills most other science fiction books nowadays. <br />I also think he throws to much in. The book almost becomes a collage of ideas and events with very little cement between them. I will now start reading Chasm City to see if that book is more solid.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|This was a good movie but to much hype that it was kind of a let down in the end. The beggining was good but the end made little sense and it was hard for me to understand the complicated plot line (and trust me im good about knowing whats happeing in movies).  The bunny was by far the reason for seeing this movie even tho there was little of him seen, so it was a let down. The \\"smerf\\" speech was the best moment in the movie and i liked how the movie it self was very humorous.  All in all, a good movie but dont expect the greatest movie in al of history.
B00006BNDI|5.0|This is one of the best black metal albums made in the early days of the Norwegian scene: when black metal was new, when the rules hadn't been fully codified, when it was more of a folk music or art form rather than commercial consideration, when few guys in the country played it. This music is dark, elegiac and hypnotic: odd harmonics and melodies are buried deep within the music either created by slowly shifting guitar or electronics. Its dense, minimal, cold, angry and sad, sometimes all at once.<br /><br />Hvis Lyset Tar Oss sounds raw and unpolished, and is some of the most atmospheric and emotional black metal ever made. The first song \\"Det Som Engang Var\\" (What Once Was) starts out with fuzzed out distorted guitar and synth and sets a tone of bleakness unlike any I've ever heard. Its just frozen cold. The last song Tomhet (Emptyness) is a slow and repetitive electronic intrumental, but despite its 14 minute length it doesn't get boring. Rather it takes you away because of its icy emotive, visual nature. Its actually beautiful (and grim) The other two songs are excellent as well. Vargs voice throughout the album sounds as though the words are being ripped out under torture, which some people might not like. I however find his \\"singing\\" expressive and an integral part of the music.<br /><br />Varg Vikernes is a psychopath, murderer, an extreme person and now a racist political philosopher with a feeble grasp on reality, but one should pay attention to the music rather than the man. The music of Burzum reflects his emotional intensity and commitment to his art. That Varg plays all the instruments is incredible. In my opinion Burzum is one of the best and certainly the most original band of early period of Norwegian black metal and \\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\\" (If the Light Takes Us) is one of Burzum's best albums.
6304806418|5.0|I was so surprised when I saw so many bad reviews for this movie. When I saw it for the first time, I fell in love with it! The story is amazing and the casting was perfect! <br /> <br />Madonna did an amazing job as Eva Duarte de Peron. She had her powerful moments when she showed great strength, but her moments of vulnerability and weakness too. Her singing was great, thought some say it wasn't powerful enough. Ok, singing novices let me tell you something. You don't belt ballads. \\"You Must Love Me\\", \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", and \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\" were supposed to be softer. She did not have a weak voice, she merely used softer dynamics to create a smoother more melancholy tone. It worked beautifully. <br /> <br />Now, my favorite character, CHE! I absolutely loved Anotonio Banderas in his role as Che! He was so wonderfully sarcastic and cynical. Not to mention funny. I could never see anyone else as Che. And who knew that Antonio could sing?! His voice is beautiful and it makes me wonder why he never went for a singing career. I mean, he has talent. Why is it always the talented singers (like him) don't record and the whiny-untalented-squeaky-immature ones (like Hilary Duff, who has no talent) who do? So messed up. Anyway, Antonio Banderas personified Che wonderfully. He did great with balancing his feelings for Evita. At the beginning he supports her and is behind her all the way, towards the middle he begins to doubt and criticize, by the waltz he hates her, but it turns around when he sees she's dying. Antonio was the best during \\"Lament\\". When he sings and kisses her coffin afterwards it shows that despite what many thought, he didn't hate her in the end, but loved her instead. He did a fabulous job in this movie. <br /> <br />Peron's character could've been better. I mean, Antonio and Madonna had all this chemistry (especially in \\"Waltz for Eva and Che) and him and Madonna had none at all. He was supposed to be her husband. Maybe it wasbecause he looked so old, but he could've been casted better. <br /> <br />Overall it is the best movie! ^_^ Go see it if you haven't!
B000005HLV|5.0|When i heard about this album everybody said that it was good, but when i got my hands on it, it turned out to be one of the best black metal albums i had ever heard.  Its just pure black metal done how it should be done written by one of the black metal godfather (euronymous-R.I.P.) Definitely a must have for any black metal fan. \m/
0446677450|5.0|Mr. Kiyosaki writes in a very enjoyable style and will change the way you think about money.  His teachings completely go against what I learned in college.  I graduated college with a degree in accounting and his book completely blew me away. I've been told that about 5% of the United States Population makes over $100,000 a year.  If a college education was the answer, more people would be making that kind of money, unfortunately theres a reason that only 5% of the population makes that kind of money, they have an education that they don't teach you in school.  The Rich Dad Poor Dad series provides you with that education.  Many people complain that the series doesn't present much how to information.  Mr. Kiyosaki's books are designed to change the way you think about money.  Once you've done that, the how to part becomes alot easier.
B0002I831S|5.0|I jumped right to the extras, and have started through the episodes - and while I haven't finished yet, I can't expain how great these are!  While the obvious picture and sound quality as evident, the real gem here is the \\"lost footage\\".  I am not old enought to recall the original airing of these gems, and catching it in repeats (as many have), the networks eliminated footage to add comercials - so I am seeing these espisodes the way they were meant to be seen - complete!  Sure I remember (and can recite dialogue) many of these stories, there has been some new (to me) footage that is simply wonderful.  I am watching in order, but can't wait for City...truly one of the best ever!
B00005JLPK|5.0|I missed Frida in the theatres, and I'm sorry I did. The performances by all the principals are amazing, but  it's the lush cinematography and production elements that set it all off like the velvet cloth used to make sure a precious gem is framed without any distractions to take the eye away. The extras give each of the collaborators a chance to show off what they are so justly proud of. <br /> <br />Watching the commentary track re the music before I viewed the movie itself was a good choice. It made me more aware of the musical elements-particularly the Spanish language ones. <br /> <br />Elliot Goldenthal's score is phenomenal-capturing the soul of a culture with deep wounds and even deeper joy and vibrance. <br /> <br />Filmed in Mexico, as seems only fitting for such Mexican cultural icons, the movie also ignites a love affair for me with the Mexican culture that I got little peeks at growing up in Az. Time to brush up my Spanish, I think.
B00005JLU1|5.0|Please bring \\"Cry-Baby\\" out on DVD! It's like the best movie of all time! You'll get lots of money for it (truly).

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring \\"Cry-Baby\\" out on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Love always Laura xoxox :) (pretty please)
0790734850|4.0|LA Confidential is still a fantastic balls to the wall movie that many of its participants will be hard pressed to equal the rest of their careers. <br /> <br />This was the first movie I ever saw Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce in. Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes is the epitome of 50's cool without a conscience. The adaptation is fantastic, even though having read and loved the book I pine for even more Ellroyesque details. <br /> <br />Most of all, taking a classic Noir story and telling it by the natural light of So Cal in the 50s creates a contrast that is intoxicating. Movies like this remind me how much I love movies. <br /> <br />The extras are okay, but I would so love a commentary track on this movie.
B00005JL78|5.0|No \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Minority Report\\" is far superior to \\"Paycheck\\" (the three are based on Philip K. Dick stories).<br /><br />Tom Cruise does not follow the classic Cruise formula here. The formula goes like this: Cruise is a winner with a flaw. Cruise takes a fall & suffers self-doubt. Cruise pulls himself together, emerges more of a winner than before & wins the girl. We've seen this played out since \\"Risky Business,\\" through jet flying, bartending, race-car driving, even in an adaptation of a John Grisham book. But it's not quite what happens here, and that's a good thing. I've been a Cruise fan ever since \\"Risky Business,\\" which was one of my favorite movies during college, but I've also seen his flaws and wondered if he was set for the kind of lifetime career say a Paul Newman had or whether he'd eventually play out. \\"Minority Report\\" makes me think Cruise could keep doing this for life, after he starts noticeably aging, and that he might end up being one of those superstar actors who actually gets considerably better as an old man than he ever was in his youth, like Sean Connery and (in my opinion) Sir Alec Guinness, for example. Bottom line: This movie is Cruise moving in a good direction, unlike the lamentable \\"Vanilla Sky\\" or \\"Cocktail,\\" both of which were low points.<br /><br />The car scene, where Anderton (Cruise) gets a car built around him as he escapes, is silly & the movie's low point. Otherwise, this is outstanding. The spiders that read retinas are wonderful, especially the scene where we see them entering a series of apartments in the same building, interrupting various activities such as domestic fights & lovemaking, which is brilliant.<br /><br />Agatha is wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Morton. Indeed Cruise and Morton are the best in the movie.<br /><br />I love the seeing/not seeing theme that continues throughout the movie. It's Shakespearean, reminiscent of \\"King Lear,\\" in which one of the main characters only starts to see after his eyes are put out.<br /><br />Here's a case where movies inspire me to read a writer (Philip K. Dick) rather than my enjoyment of a writer inspiring me to see the movies. I will be reading his work.<br /><br />Yep. Thoroughly entertaining escapism while trapped in a barracks room with five other Soldiers on a tropical island during a hurricane, which is when I saw it.<br /><br />Much to be encouraged about in this movie. I hope we see more of this quality of movie rather than the endless trash Hollywood seems to have been churning out in the past couple of years.. <br />Here's a case where movies inspire me to read a writer (Philip K.

B000286RNY|1.0|This movie is repulsive, vulgar, boring, and completely illogical.  I know this is supposed to be a \\"funny\\" movie, but it's merely a rubbish heap of failed jokes and sight gags. In fact, this movie is so bad that it creates a black hole, into which all other movies are sucked and destroyed.
6305252521|5.0|Many of the best comedies ever made have been about subjects that hardly seem funny in real life.  Nuclear holocaust is hardly a humorous topic, but \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" a film about a Doomsday Machine that destroys the entire Earth with nuclear weapons is still one of the greatest comedies of all time.  \\"The Producers,\\" a film about creating a play that praises Hitler draws laughs to this day.   <br /> <br />\\"The Truman Show\\" is another film that causes us to laugh at things that scare us.  The idea of wasting thirty years of your life not knowing that you live in a fake, controlled world is not funny at all.  In fact, given the current state of television and reality shows, it seems downright frightening.  Of course, the film could have been handled very differently, it could have been delivered as a straight drama, and maybe it would have been just as good.  But the film is in no way harmed by it's comedic treatment of a serious subject - at no point does the film trivialize the subject matter.  Compare \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"Fail-Safe,\\" two great films with very different treatments of the same subject.    <br /> <br />Peter Weir (one of the more talented, less-known living directors) does a fine job.  Jim Carrey gives a rare honest, comedic performance without ever overdoing it (at no point in the film does he talk out of his backside, eg. Ace Ventura.)  The soundtrack is surprisingly great, enhancing the mood of the film quite well.   <br /> <br />The film is just the right length, and ends in a nearly perfect manner.   <br /> <br />An all-around amazing movie - one of the truly great films of the last ten years.  Highly, highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am neither Old School or New School Militant Star Wars Geek. For those of us though who repeatedly watched Star Wars over and over in 1977 in movie theaters, who sat in line at 6am the first day when Empire Strikes Back was released, and then once again when Return of the Jedi was released, there was a magic to those movies at the time that has stayed with us all these years.<br /><br />When the Special Editions were released in the movie theater I will never forget sitting there and hearing the music, in a movie theater, reading the words scroll up on a big screen once again, I was nine years old all over again and it was 1977 again. The movies looked great, sounded great, and Empire Strikes Back blew me away all over again.<br /><br />The couple added scenes that he directed didn't bother me and for the most part all the new special effects were great, jarring to be sure for those of us who have seen the three movies hundreds of times but it looked good. I won't bother to bring up the old argument \\"Han shot First...\\" change, its pointless. To be honest the only part that really irritated me was at the end of Return of the Jedi. Instead of this small celebration with those who survived the battle on Endor and the admittedly cheezy but classic song, Lucas had to show the whole empire celebrating with fireworks, etc, and added new music over the old which to this day if I watched the video I would turn it off because it is just so annoying.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that Lucas has forgotten one thing, the most important and only thing that matters in movies to us who love them, especially Star Wars as we sat in theaters in 1977. Star Wars was magical to us. His obessive changing scenes, switching scenes, adding new special effects, etc, doesn't make any one of the three movies better. Just because you can change something, doesn't mean you should.<br /><br />Now he changes the movies again? I'll reserve judgement when I watch all 3 DVD's a week from Tuesday. What Lucas does now he does only for himself. It's his way of telling all of us Star Wars fans that made him the rich in the first place that he can do what he wants with his movies. This is true, they are his movies, but along the way he forgot what made them magical in the first place.<br /><br />The Star Wars Trilogy is finally gonna be out on DVD. Of course im gonna be at the store pounding on the glass for the doors to open. I'll run home and pop them in the DVD player one at a time, watching them with friends. I'll watch them over and over and over.<br /><br />Hey, George Lucas may have forgotten about the magic, but whatever he changes or doesn't change, everytime I hear the music, and watch the words scroll up on my screen, its 1977 again and Lucas will never be able to kill that magic.om Tuesday.

B000060OFT|4.0|Here we have a film with a lot of beauty and creativity, in the typical Luhrmann style.  Unfortunately, the fast-paced editing makes it hard to truly appreciate some of the more stunning sights and sounds of the film.  Sometimes the lines are delivered in a strangely rushed manner that takes away some of their impact.   <br /> <br />It may seem a bit bizarre at first, but the modern day setting, combined with the Shakespearean dialogue, actually works quite well.  There is a real attraction between DeCaprio and Danes.  They seem to genuinely like each other, and there is some real passion in their scenes together.  The cinematography is beautiful, with some extremely memorable shots of the city and of water (indeed, there seems to be a focus on water in this film.)  The ending is just slightly changed from the original, but it's still effective, even poetic, and still managed to draw a few tears from my eyes.  <br /> <br />I still prefer the 1968 version (and the original play,) but those who enjoy the Luhrmann style should find this film to be quite interesting.  Recommended, with reservations.
1400032717|3.0|This book reminded me a lot of Steve Martin's \\"Pleasure of My Company.\\"  It is as equally quirky, sweet and sad-- and just as ultimately unsatisfying to read because the main character's experience of life is filtered thru the lens of his dysfunction.  <br />He doesn't really react to the tragic events in his life in a way that's meaningful to the reader. I wouldn't recommend it to buy-- but check it (or Martin's book) out from the library.
B0002IU988|4.0|After years of success and accumulating a ton of fans (including myself!), Creed disbanded. While most fans wanted to hear at least something from the former group members, who would have guessed what would follow would be BETTER than Creed? You get that with Alter Bridge's \\"One Day Remains\\". The album has twice the emotion, complexity, vocal range, guitar riffage...etc! Any fan of rock, Creed, or just good music should grab this disc. You'll jam to \\"Find the Real\\", sing along with \\"Open Your Eyes\\", headbang to \\"Metalingus\\", choke up during \\"In Loving Memory\\", and totally love \\"Shed my Skin\\"-the album's best track. Pop it in the player, and listen as it gets better and better with each track. What else can I say? Former Creed members Philips, Marshall, and Tremonti are back and better than before!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Words can't describe how good this series is....you have to watch it from beginning to end.
0380002930|5.0|What's that, you say? Nearly all of the bad reviews for this book. They make me laugh and at the same time, weep for the future. You \\"kids\\" just don't get it. Yes, this book is about rabbits. No, it's not about cute, fluffy bunnies. It's meant to be taken seriously and will be by mature people with a modicum of intelligence who actually want to read a good piece of classic fiction. I fell in love with it at a very early age, but then I was always encouraged to read for pleasure. This wasn't forced on me as part of my studies. I highly recommend this to anyone equipped with the tools to handle it. All the others should stick to their comic books.
068987474X|5.0|I read a review of this book in the Washington Post and knew I had to get a copy. Yes, its message is repetitive, but, unfortunately, we need to hear it over and over -- and also, within the repetitive message, lines popped out at me that hit really hard and true. I am 43 and coming out of a 22 year marriage: it is pretty hard to read this and say, \\"He just wasn't that into me\\" BUT there is a lot of freedom from there. I see now that I was not that into HIM either - I was into who I thought he should be or could be! I have women friends of all ages who still cycle through, \\"I met the greatest guy, I'm in love\\" and then, \\"He (insert bad behavior or reason for breakup), I'm devastated, why why why.\\"  Let's get a life and get real. We are great! Thanks so much, Greg.
B00008CLOA|5.0|After years of Dark Side of the Moon released in many formats their is finally the SACD Super Audio CD. This CD has two layers one layer is for standered CD players the other can be played on a Super Audio CD player. I personally think the sound is just as good as the SACD layer. This CD was released in such a great format 30 Anniversary Edition wow! The sound quality in 5.1 surround sound is brillant. Every song in every detail sounds much better than any other Dark Side Of The Moon. The CD is great, so is the music including Us And Them, Money, and The Great Gig In The Sky. Inside is a huge booklet with many posters, and album covers across the world including the russian cover and the lyrics to all of the songs. This is the best Pink Floyd Dark Side Of The Moon by all means!!!
B0002F6B7Y|1.0|Having seen Breaking the Waves, which I did enjoy although disturbing yet thought provoking I expected more of the same in Dogville. However, this is the worst move I think I've ever seen. After watching for about 10 minutes of this it came out of my DVD. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to rent it.
B000002JSR|4.0|Coda was released shortly after the band broke up due to John Bonham's death but in all means, I liked Coda.... I thought it was a well presentation of studio recordings/live performences including a great performence of \\"I Cant Quit You Baby\\" recorded at the sound rehersal at the Royal Albert Hall Sept, 1, 1970. I also enjoyed We're Gonna Groove, and Wearing And Tearing. The only two recordings on this album that are not any good are Ozone Baby, and Bonzo's Montreux. Most of the songs are three to four minutes long one song ranking 5:28 which is Wearing And Tearing. Average album with alot of goodies!!! Please sample some of the songs on amazon before you buy it to see if you really enjoyed this unreleased material!!
0953104907|3.0|This book is an informative discussion about guitar building, and shows Melvyn Hiscock's techniques and designs pretty well,but it is not a book to enable a person with no woodworking or shop experience to make a guitar without substantial additional resources and a fair amount of scrap wood being generated. One thing that my attempts at guitarmaking have taught me is that if you set even reasonably high standards for yourself, and practice every technique on scrap wood repeatedly first, you will still go through a fair amount of wood before you have a guitar you can wave under the nose of the salesman at the local PRS dealer with pride. <br /> <br /> Also, Hiscock is British and there are some differences between UK and American practice, both in terminology and in the way certain tools, and woods, are selected and used. (Sycamore is popular in England because of availabiility and because famous Brit builders such as Tony Zemaitis used it extensively, but no one in the U.S. does.) It doesn't interfere with the content of the book, but if you go into an Ace Hardware and ask for Perspex, you'll be given only a strange look rather than a sheet of Plexiglas.  <br /> <br /> This book is definitely better than some others, but would still be best used in conjunction with others, both guitar-specific and for general woodworking.

B0000027RL|4.0|AHHHH, Pearl Jam.  There's nuthin quite like'em.  Stone Temple Pilots may've strived to sound EXACTLY like them, Scott Stapp may still pretend to BE Eddie Vedder, Silverchair may have once aspired to BECOME them . . . but for all of these fools' greatest efforts, they still couldn't quite manage it.<br /><br />Pearl Jam stands above everything else surrounding it, a staple of the rock world, even more so, I believe, than the mighty NIRVANA.  Though, I probably shouldn't be saying that, since I have yet to hear Nirvana album outside of the self-titled `greatest hits'.  BUT STILL, PJ has something much more to them than Nirvana, SOUNDGARDEN and ALICE IN CHAINS **combined**(sorry if this offends anyone, but it's my opinion, which is subject to change every once-in-a-long-while).<br /><br />Anyway.  This album has some of the best dang songs ever written.  It also, unfortunately, has some of the most forgettable.  Despite being the band's most successful and recognized album of their career(by the masses, of course), I find it to be lacking in some big ways.<br /><br />First, there's the album's production quality.  It sucks, making some songs sound too sorrowfully distant; the instruments left sounding cold and forgettable, so tracks that SHOULD be filling me with jaw-dropping amazement aren't nearly as hard-hitting(example: `Oceans', `Garden'). The band obviously had humble beginnings, and that's cool with me, but it drags the album down anyways.<br /><br />There are some other songs that don't really NEED the production to drag them down.  Like `Deep', which I simply don't get, be it musically, lyrically, metaphorically, grammatically, geographically, and so on.  `Garden' sets a great tone, but the lyrics kinda lose me early on, and I've heard maybe a million songs with this same kind of soft plucking riff, and for this it looses points.<br /><br />`Why Go' and `Porch' and `Once' are pretty hard-rocking songs and certainly fun to sing with, `Once' being the best of the three.  BUT, while good, they're overshadowed by the amazingness of other tracks on the record.  I usually skip these tracks, which is unusual for me.  In fact, I usually make it a point to listen to songs that I don't really like, and by doing so they become some of my absolute favorites.  Maybe I just need to listen to these more, but as for now they do (almost) nothing for me.<br /><br />BUT OF COURSE, these are fairly minor quibbles.  Cuz I mean, there's still `Jeremy'.  There's `Alive'.  There's `Release'.  There's `Black'.  There's beauty beyond musical measure, found only with the emotional calculators of the soul.<br /><br />There is probably no song that hits me as powerfully and as emotionally as `Jeremy'.  The song has honesty melting from every chord strummed, every beat of the drums, each thump of the bass, every lyric passionately expressed.  The riff that opens and plays throughout the song is profoundly mesmerizing, driving emotion almost as fervently as Eddie's vocals, which simply have no equal.  And there's nothing more I can possibly hope to say to explain my love for this song.  But I'm fairly sure my loss for words may be better than whatever else I might think of, so there you go.<br /><br />Obviously, `Jeremy' is only one of the sweet musical gems on \\"Ten\\".  The singing and instrumentation is excellent throughout most of the record, from the amazing musical work on `Alive'(as well as it's awesome chorus), to the exciting, pounding harshness of `Even Flow', even if the song isn`t THAT great.  `Release' is a truly beautiful piece and a magnificent way to end the album, resolving all of the record's problems with the single line \\"I'll hold the pain, release me . . . release me, oh\\".  The music ebbs away slowly, thoughtfully, and capsulates the emotional power of the song as easily as Eddie does.  And `Black' has all that too, as well as one of the most gorgeous melodies ever conceived.<br /><br />So, with a now absolute loss of what I could possibly say that hasn't been said a thousand times before a million other people said it first . . . I'll end this now.  Not as awesome as most people think, since the river of untainted greatness doesn't flow throughout the whole album, as a 5-star disc should.  But, if you're a music guru worth your salt and your headphones, you'll surely appreciate it.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4, making for a good disc with lovely moments, but \\"Vs.\\" is better, and I'm sure it only goes up from there.loss of what I could possibly say that hasn't been said a thousand times before a million other people said it first . . .

B00005K9LN|5.0|British Steel was the first Priest album that i bought. I was not sure of what songs were on it, but i heard reviews of this album being one of Priest's best. I'm glad i went with what I heard, because British Steel is a brilliant album. There is not one weak track here. While some songs are a littl better than others, this one holds up well throughout. This album holds up well to the other Priest CDs as well. Bottom Line, British Steel works because it has great songs. You can't go wrong with that. If you are thinking about getting into Priest, you may want to consider getting this cd first. It captures Priest going from their 70's phase to their 80's. Therefore, you can look to go either way after you got it. Try it on for yourself. You may like what you hear!
B000089RVX|5.0|Who the heck would be better then Amy Lee? That's what I thought because Evanescence is the BEST band ever. It's cheap so buy it today.
B000002KE2|5.0|When I first got this album, I overlooked it in favor of its more famous rivals such as Paranoid and Black Sabbath. Yet, now I have come to realize the power that is Vol. 4. I feel Vol.4 is one of Black Sabbath's least appreciated cds; People say its good but many never really know why. Bottomline, Vol. 4 picks up where Master of Reality left off, since this one has its own set of riffs. The most notable song off this set is Snowblind, since many people know it and Sabbath always plays it at their shows. Yet the rest of the album is just as compelling; You have Supernaut, Everyday comes and goes and Wheels of Confusion, one of my favorite Sabbath songs. It really pays to listen to this cd since it too is very consistent. The later half finds the band taking it easy with some shorter numbers, but these helpe the flow of the cd. Overall, This is is an awesome records that needs to be heard. That is my opinion, of course. But try it anyways; You may end up liking it a lot.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|If you like action/horror films, find zombies terrifying (and therefore, excellent scary movie material), have a thing for Milla Jovovich, or most likely, have played and LOVED any of the many Resident Evil video games out there, then you need to check out this awesome film and its even better sequel. Personally, Milla is a bit too \\"stereotype super model\\" for my taste, but she's made some great movies, few things scare me more than Romero-stlye zombies, and  the Resident Evil games are the shiznight! Especially part 2, with the delectable Claire Redfield! Anywho, Resident Evil (the movie) is a sort of prequel to the video games, so don't worry if you're unfamiliar with them. The plot goes something like this: The Umbrella Corporation is the most powerful commercial entity in the world, producing a variety of cosmetic and other type products, but making their real money off illegal scientific research and development. Their most horrific new discovery is the T-virus, a chemical agent capable of causing monstrous mutations and even bringing the dead back to life! As if that didn't make it a scary enough place to work, their main center of operations is a huge, underground research facility called \\"The Hive,\\" located deep below the surface of Raccoon City. The only entrance to the facility is through the walls of a huge mansion on the outskirts of the city. The mansion is guarded by two security agents working for the company and under the guise of a newlywed couple. Everything is very well controlled and planned out, until the day the T-Virus is set loose!<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich), one of the security operatives guarding the mansion, wakes up to find herself naked and confused on the shower floor, with no memory of her life or identity. Suddenly, her home is stormed by a special ops team, and she and two mysterious men are taken prisoner. She soon is informed of who she is and who she works for, and that the strange circumstances are due to something gone wrong within the Hive. Using the secret entrance, the group travels via an underground train to the secret research facility, where they discover the worst has occurred. The T-Virus has escaped, the \\"Red Queen, the computer entity that controls the security of the underground lair, has killed all employees to minimize risk of spreading the contamination, and all those dead employees are slowly waking up....and they are hungry! Suddenly, the race is on to get back to the train and out of the mansion before the secret blast doors close-up and seal their doom! But, before they can save themselves,  they'll have to face the wrath of the Red Queen, the terror of some monstrously mutated dogs, a horrific creature called \\"The Licker,\\" and an army of the living dead!<br /><br />What makes \\"Resident Evil\\" such an excellent film is the style and attention with which it is executed. Even on a tight budget, the filmmakers, most of which were fans of the game themselves, went to great lengths to make this a movie worth watching again and again! The style of the game is ever present, from the extremely authentic scenes, creatures, and characters, to the brilliant sets, lighting, and camera angles. Homage is paid to great scifi/horror films of the past, as well as to \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" seemingly a favorite book of filmmakers all over. The cast is excellently chosen for this type of movie, and I'm particularly impressed with their love of the games. Michelle Rodriguez is frightening, even when not a zombie, and Eric Mabius looks computer generated himself! And I don't mind adding that the producer's sister makes quite a lovely Dr./zombie in the film. And speaking of zombies, thanks so much for sticking with the game and not making those new, fast moving style zombies we see so much in current horror. Those are scary, but they're nowhere near as creepy. Conserving their energy for when you're within reach, these zombies are fast when they need to be, their deceptive slowness making them all the more frightening! The new \\"Deluxe\\" version of the DVD isn't overwhelmingly loaded with extras, after all, it's still only one disc, but it does include a fun cast and crew commentary that brings to mind a favorite line from Zoolander: \\"A model, idiot.\\" It also includes theatrical trailers and featurettes, a clip from Resident Evil: Apocalypse, a visual effects commentary, an alternate ending that I'm sooo happy they didn't use (the ending they DID use is awesome), and filmographies. An incredibly cool, must own film for all fans of the video game and zombie genres! And the sequel is even better!aking them all the more frightening!

B00000DGRX|4.0|I felt the need to give this album 4 stars not because of the musuic, but more so because of the product. The remastering is nice, but the extra disc felt unnessecary. That being said, Machine Head is pretty well put together; Lacking a single weak track. Sure, it has Smoke on the Water, but it also has Highway Star, Space Truckin' and Lazy as well. This is just great hard rock, with each member contributing equally well. I feel Ian Paice is underrated because he defintely can play the drums yet he never really gets recognition for it. In any way, Machine Head is worth listening. The regular version of the album is good but while it's not entirely worth the price, the remaster would be better choice.e You get more songs and impressive sound quality. Check this one out. It might be what you are looking for!

B000060MMI|2.0|This is a cd that lost credit with me over time.  Being massively into Irish culture I picked it up because of it's style but I found with repeat listening it was a lot of the same old stuff.  Every song sounds like the following and the previous.  What's wrong with this album seems to me to be an affliction that much popular punk music suffers from these days.  Oversimplified drumbeats and a lack of any originality make it tough to listen to it over and over again.   <br />It's obvious that Floggin Molly owes a debt to The Pogues, but they fail to capture the originality and musicality of those they emulate.  While this album can be fun to listen to, and is frenetic (it keeps me awake on long road trips) it is not musically astounding.  I enjoy listening to it sometimes, but only for its simplicity and pace.
0060537639|5.0|\\"1421\\" is a fascinating book: extremely well researched and well documented evidence in support of the claim that the Chinese visited America - and circumnavigated the globe - at least 70 years before Columbus.  Yet almost as amazing as the advancement of Chinese technology and navigation that led to this achievement is China's historical withdrawal from the west in the same century these monumental discoveries took place.  There are those who've claimed to have read this book, but whose misguided western egos somehow won't allow them to open their minds and base their conclusions on the evidence presented by Menzies.  Perhaps these small minds will take some solace in the fact that while China had indeed achieved cultural and technological heights far beyond those of contemporary western civilizations, that through their own brand of nationalistic arrogance, failed to capitalize on these advancements, returning instead to a closed and insular society.  In short, an intriguing thesis, that can't help leave one wondering, \\"what would have happened if ...?\\"
B000002HH2|4.0|starting off with the dark, deep, somewhat haunting \\"army of me\\" starts the album off perfectly and is a great opening. i think army of me is by far bjorks best song all though that is debatable seeing as she has released so many other great songs. the album continues with the same pace until you get to the up-beat, quirky \\"its oh so quiet\\" which doesnt fit in very well with the rest of the album but blows you away with the fact that she so pulled it off on an album like this. that is one of the many great things about bjork. \\"enjoy\\" is one of my very favourites on this album and makes you just want to dance as soon as you hear it. \\"enjoy\\" is very energetic and is a nice transition into the softer side of the album. with the album finishing on such tracks like \\"isobel\\". the only bad thing about this album is \\"headphones\\" and \\"you have been flirting again\\" and even \\"i miss you\\" leaves you wondering why it was on this particular album. but the good outway the bad and i reccomend any new bjork fan to start off with this album it will leave you wanting her whole collection
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is a REALLY BREATH-TAKING movie! I loved it! It's about this weather scientist (Dennis Quaid) who finds a strange pattern in the weather reports. He tells the Weather Board that something is wrong with the weather patterns, leading to Global Warming and Cooling. He also has the theory that the next ice age might not be too far off. Yup. His (HOT) son (Jake Gyllenhaal) flys to New York for a school competition, and that;s where the trouble starts. Upon his arrival, it is raining cats and dogs, leading to a massive flood, which sends everyone in Ney York to the highest point in the city manageable. The library. There,  there is the question of whether to stay or go, considering the condition. The majority leaves, leaving about ten people. It was a good idea to stay, too. The others that went died of coldness or in the Eye of the Storm. Ther the others are left waithing for Gylenhaal's father to come with a rescue team. Will they get there in time? Or will the weather catch up with them?
074325144X|5.0|Dreyer has a compelling theory on running (and how to run)  that upends our conventional thinking about what it means  and what we have to suffer when we do run.       He juxtaposes what he calls \\"power running\\"  -- understandable, since we, as adults do rely on strength to pull our bodies through each running step -- to a natural, gravity-propelled,  and indeed child-like style, based on tai-chi precepts of balance and body dynamics.      Dreyer's book is a real shot of fresh air inshowing us how to minimize effort (and therefore injury) and maximize efficiency, speed and distance.    Dreyer writes with an open, light style that's fun to read.  But he's dead serious about running naturally and he's articulately encapsulated his theories in tangible ways.       Dreyer's book shows us that no pain can result in measurable gain in running.
B0002B15WE|5.0|It seems clear now that the 1988 film \\"Die Hard\\" is one of the most important cinematic touchstones of our lifetime, simply because every action film since then can be reduced to being a variation on the theme (e.g., \\"Speed\\" is \\"Die Hard\\" on a bus). I am not going to claim that \\"Die Hard\\" is more than mindless entertainment, but rather that it is the standard by which all mindless entertainment is to be judged.<br /><br />One Christmas New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies out to Los Angeles to enjoy a nice, quiet Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is climbing up the corporate ladder of the Nakatomi Corporation. However John arrives at the company office party a few minutes before a group of terrorists, led by the urbane Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), takes over and holds everybody hostage. While the bad guys begin the long process of breaking into the building' vault, McClane becomes the proverbial \\"fly in the ointment,\\" on the loose in the building and causing problems. The only person on McClane's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), a cop on the outside who learns about what is really happening inside Nakatomi tower when McClane drops a dead body on his squad car. Also working against McClane are top cop and complete idiot Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and sleazy reporter Thronburg (William Atherton).<br /><br />What makes \\"Die Hard\\" work? First, the film had the virtue of making Bruce Willis a movie star. Prior to this point he had failed to make his success with television's \\"Moonlighting\\" translate to movies. Leading roles in \\"Blind Date\\" and \\"Sunset\\" were disappointing enough that the best part of Willis's cinematic resume was being a courtroom spectator in \\"The Verdict.\\" But in John McClane he had a character that allowed him to get off his one-liners but was also involved in some big action sequences and still found time to use his brains on several occasions. I also like the adding insult to injury twist of fate that finds McClane barefoot when things start happening. The result was that suddenly Willis was promoted to the A list, which almost always makes a bigger splash than when the star is there to begin with.<br /><br />Second, there were the action sequences, the best of which remains McClane's jump off the exploding top of the building with a fire hose wrapped around his waist. Everything else pales next to that one, but the common theme you have with all of the key sequences is that McClane is an ordinary guy facing long odds in a series of extraordinary circumstances. Another common denominator is that for what McClane comes up with usually involves some thinking as well, such as using an office chair and a computer to create a detonator for plastique explosives. McClane might be unlucky, but he is not stupid. Add to this the fact that the action is pretty much non-stop once it gets started, and this is by no means a boring film.<br /><br />Third, there are actually some emotional elements to the story, with McClane obviously worried about his wife being held by terrorists being at the top of the list. But there is also the relationship between McClane and Sgt. Powell, even though it exists almost entirely over the radio (but has a nice double payoff in the film's denouement). The scene where McClane asks Powell to pass along a message to Holly provides a sense of despair that usually does not enter into one of these films.<br /><br />Ultimately, John McTiernan's film achieves a solid balance between characters and actions. If an action film succeeds on the basis of the villain, then Rickman certainly provides that (I like the way his character is introduced), and I have always thought that VelJohnson's show \\"Family Matters\\" was an obvious and intelligent effort to capitalize on how great of a character he created in this movie. Then there is Bedelia's Holly Gennaro McClane, who has it all, including a good right hook. You might not understand how those twoended up together in the first place, but can sure appreciate why he wants to stay married to her.<br /><br />Even the fact that \\"Die Hard 4: Die Hardest\\" is currently in pre-production can distract from the reputation of the original. Actually the two sequels are better than most of the imitators that have come down the road (\\"Speed\\" is definitely the best of that bunch). Besides making Willis a big time movie star it certainly set the bar higher for all the action films that have been made since 1988 and showed that you needed to have some heart and a sense of style to go with all the witty one-liners and explosive pyrotechnics. \\"Die Hard\\" is still a lot of fun to watch.w those two ended up together in the first place, but can sure appreciate why he wants to stay married to her. <br /> <br />Even the fact that \\"Die Hard 4: Die Hardest\\" is currently in pre-production can distract from the reputation of the original.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|\\"Master and Commander\\" is a film of great integrity. It follows through on its promises, commits its characters to both the heroics and the sins of their natures, has the courage of its convictions and portrays nobility of spirit without maudlin sentiment. In short, it is a wonderful balancing act. The fact that it has intelligent plotting, literate dialogue, classical themes, inspired acting and is both well paced and superbly filmed only adds to its many virtues. <br /> <br />Intelligent restraint is in evidence throughout this film. Peter Weir shows restraint in his decision to let the story tell itself. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany show restraint in their superb understated acting. Together, they are like a thinking person's Gene Rodenberry, Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy. Think of these archetypes stripped of their overacting and most egregious tendencies and you will have some idea of the qualities conveyed by the three principals in this film. <br /> <br />The plot and setting have been well summarized in other reviews, but those are poor reasons to view a film such as \\"Master and Commander\\". It is really a film about timeless qualities now hopelessly out of fashion: things like duty, honour, loyalty, friendship, mutual reliance and the questing spirit. Cynics will hate this film for its proud and unapologetic portrayal of old fashioned values. The rest of us will not only love it, but find it inspirational. <br /> <br />I am both hopeful and apprehensive of a sequel. On the one hand, I look forward to further adaptations of Peter O'Brien's work. On the other hand, this first adaptation has set such a high standard that I fear the next film making a complete hash of things.
B00007M5CO|5.0|You will like this music if you enjoy electronic - lounge - techno, that is the base, sometimes even some hip-hop fuzzy flavor. But over that base lies a complex variety of sounds of the beautiful tango of Buenos Aires and Uruguay. Not necesarily the full shape of a tango song, but just enough to produce a fascinating CD with an array of sounds that will take you on a trip to the Bajofondo.  <br />I am waiting for more. (Actually, I just got more: \\"Supervielle\\", the latest release from BFTC is out and is as good as the original compilation.)
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This cinematic treat from Sofia Coppola is an art house film in the best sense of that tradition, and is so clearly not for everyone that I just don't understand why the Terminator crowd even bother with it. The negative reviews variously citing its slow pace, meandering storyline, open-ended structure and lack of conventional resolution are all spot on. But these are the film's very strengths, and the furthest things from weaknesses. <br /> <br />This film is about imperfectly real people, and portrays them with a depth and authenticity that Hollywood rarely strives for, much less achieves. It doesn't pander to hoary conventions or cheap passions, and its deliberate pacing and loose structure are actually products of the director's faith in the intelligence of her audience. She is counting on us to be both receptive and contemplative--sensitive enough to pick up on nuance and understatement without explicit narrative and broadcasted emotive cues. Based on the negative reviews on this site, it's too bad that her faith is misplaced in so many. <br /> <br />Art house films may test our maturity, but too often do so by stepping over into bombast and pretension. Consider \\"My Dinner With Andre\\", or \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\". In this film Coppola succeeds in coupling maturity with humility: she shows but doesn't tell; she teaches but doesn't preach; she has so much respect for our intelligence that she leaves blanks throughout the film and invites us to fill them in. However, this strands those incapable of or disinclined to filling in such blanks. <br /> <br />This film examines the undercurrents of life. It recognises that the truly vexing parts of life are not the Big Questions, and therefore doesn't proffer Big Answers. If you are looking for soap opera drama, you won't find it here. Likewise, if you are looking for a follow-the-bouncing-dot story, you had best stick with Titanic. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of blank verse poetry: it uses loose structure, unusualrhythms and absence of rhyme to evoke life's discontinuities. Its themes are subterranean and not at all open to mechanical analysis. <br /> <br />The search for meaning in life is invariably difficult and frustrating. We devote much energy to tracking down false leads and dead ends before slowly plotting out the few roads that lead to worthy destinations. This film respects that process by mirroring the journey of its characters in like terms. For example, much of their time is spent staring out windows. For the music video crowd, this is just dead air; but, for thoughtful people, such moments are pauses for reflection. Every time one of the characters pause, we pause, and consider aspects of their existence--hoping that they will arrive at conclusions that will take them one step closer to untangling their lives. It takes a special film to make a viewer so sympathetic to the characters that we step into their skins, and Lost in Translation delivers with a sincerity that is rare and heartfelt. <br /> <br />I would not dream of recommending this film to everyone. Those who need the comfort of formula, the clarity of spoon-fed exposition, and the reassurance of convention will get absolutely nothing out of this film and should just skip it. Here's a simple test: if you feel that, for a movie to be complete, the boy must either get the girl or sacrifice himself in compliance to some tired heroic clich, then don't bother with this film. You won't like it. But if you can handle uncertainty, meandering structure and understated nuance, then give this film a try. Among mass entertainment that assumes its spectators to be morons, this film's quiet eloquence and regard for its audience is as air to a drowning man.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I  was in  high school  when Star  Trek originally  ran.  Even  with the  cheesy special effects and overacting,  it was a show  that we looked forward  to every week.  With the US in a foreign war, it was no wonder that a show would be so popular with a Prime Directive of non-interference.  Here is a synopsis of the episodes in the second season. <br /> <br />1. Amok Time: Spock must return to Vulcan to complete a mating ceremony.  <br />2. Who Mourns for Adonis?: The God Apollo invites the crew to his planet. One female crew member falls in love with him. <br />3. The Changeling: A probe has changed from its original purpose to seek out life to a new purpose of destroying all imperfect life forms. <br />4. Mirror, Mirror: A transporter malfunction send Kirk, Scott, McCoy, and Uhura into an alternate universe where the Galactic Empire is based on terror, treachery, and force. <br />5. The Apple: A planet is beautiful but the plants shoot deadly needles and rocks explode. The peaceful inhabitants feed a computer that oppresses the culture of the planet. <br />6.

044651652X|1.0|Pungent Piles of Purple Prose! Pulsing Pangs of Poignant Pain! Perverted Peek at Porno Past!  <br /> <br />Get the idea? <br /> <br />This book takes sentimentality, clich, melodrama, formula and overkill, orders them up in tonne lots, then shoves them through a meat grinder to spit out those pre-mixed, pre-spiced, perfectly uniform patties that just ache for the barbeque. No thought required. Just light the briquettes, stoke up the heat, and watch them babies SIZZLE. <br /> <br />I never thought I would read a book like this... I never thought anyone could WRITE a book like this. Surely, there are boundaries that even the most jaded writers do not cross. Surely, there is a lower limit to ones rejection of self-respect. Guess not. Silly me. Kitsch is bottomless. <br /> <br />In a way, it isn't possible to hate this book. It is so bad that it provokes a certain campy ghoulish fascination. It becomes self-parody, like \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\". Too bad this one can't be destroyed with Donny Osmond songs. In another way, it isn't quite fair to single out \\"Bridges\\" like this. Thousands of putrid novels are published every year. They just don't take themselves so seriously. Or their readers don't, which is much the more important thing. <br /> <br />The fact that this book became the biggest seller since the New Testament, and generated more dripping fluid than Niagara Falls, is an indictment of the literary decay in our society. These days, we emote on queue by remote control. <br /> <br />Putrid Paean to Prairie Passion! <br /> <br />It's a sad, sad day in Iowa.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Much like that of the film, Kill Bill Volume 1: The Soundtrack manages to pay homage to the essential elements of classic films.      Opening with the famous \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\", and \\"That Certain Female\\", Kill Bill Volume 1 quickly moves from Hollywood classics to trademarks of cult Japanese and Asian cinema.  Easily the shining star of the album \\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" is an emotional pipe tune that is used to tremendous effect in the film as the opening to the chapter \\"Showdown at House of Blue Leaves\\".    Kill Bill Volume 1 manages to incorporate many different styles and genres while still being a cohesive whole.  With the likes of the fast paced \\"Green Hornet\\", the overwrought hit \\"Battle without Honor or Humanity\\", the party track \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" and the slow sounds of \\"The Flower of Carnage\\", Kill Bill Volume 1 could have easily found itself into the \\"trying to be too much and therefore doesn't work\\" category.  Like the film, these various elements come together and DO work.    But, as you may have guessed from my 4 out of 5 star rating, this collection is not perfect.  One element that doesn't work for me is the script samples from the film.  The only thing that tracks such as \\"Queen of the Crime Council\\", and \\"You're My Wicked Life\\" do is mean that I wouldn't play this album to my family, which I would otherwise be quite happy to do.  As someone has already pointed out, the Crime Council track is the only one that justifies the album a \\"Parental Advisory\\" label.  Another track that doesn't come off for me is \\"Ode to Oren Ishii\\".  I'm a fan of other RZA work, the Samurai-HipHop thing worked well in Ghost Dog but doesn't fare so well here.  As far as I know this track doesn't appear in the film (correct me if I'm wrong).  Most of the sound effects don't do anything for me, except for the classic \\"Ironside\\" sample.  All of these gripes however, would be forgotten if one more track had been included in the collection.  \\"Death Ridesa Horse\\", appearing at one of the most tense scenes in the film, is unfortunatly missing from the soundtrack.    Overall this is a great album, its strongest appeal will be with those who are fans of the film.  I suggest anyone who is a big fan of cinema in general, especially to asian cinema fans that they have a listen to this album.  Chances are you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It unapologetically shows decapitations and dismemberments, slaughter, betrayal and murder. Those blithely seeking cartoon pabulum will be shocked and offended. But if you are looking for provocative intelligent adult anime, then Princess Mononoke is like a sea wind blowing away the saccharine smog that smothers western animation. <br /> <br />For one thing, it has no villains. This will confuse childish minds conditioned to expect not only good and bad in every movie, but to have the bad guys clearly labelled with black hats, scars and ugly sneers. For another, it doesn't hide its ambivalence with technology or its respect for nature. In fact, that is its thesis: how we lose our way when we reject our connection to the natural world. This will offend narrow minds who look upon any challenge to their anthropocentrism as \\"anti-human\\" or \\"tree-hugging sentimentality\\". <br /> <br />This film argues that evil is not so much the satanic absolute modeled in western tradition as it is an organic malady caused by pain and despair. We do not become evil because we are corrupted by some outside agency; we become evil because we choose hatred over acceptance when confronted by the inevitability of death. How many western cartoons dare to tack into such philosophical winds? <br /> <br />Princess Mononoke punctures conventions. The princess of the title is a wolf-child saved from death as an infant by a wolf god and her pack. Now consider: in a western cartoon, the wolf pack would be a misunderstood and persecuted animal family too cute for words and too noble to stomach. In this movie, they are a snarling force of nature who do not hesitate to kill. However, they earn our sympathy because we understand that they are driven to kill both out of necessity and because it is their nature to do so. In a western cartoon, heroic animals would automatically mean casting their human opponents in the role of villains. But in Princess Mononoke, the humans compete for our sympathy because they too are convinced that they must destroy the wolves to ensure their own survival. In a western cartoon, the male hero would rescue the female heroine to live happily ever after. I won't spoil the ending, but consider how much more intelligent, more thoughtful and truer to character is the conclusion in this film. <br /> <br />This juxtaposition of conflicting needs and loyalties, all with their own justifications, their own perspectives, and their own claims on our sympathies, combine to produce a richly textured world that is complex in scope and multifaceted in meaning. This film does not capitulate to simplistic solutions. Much of hard work and great beauty is destroyed in the end, but the film still concludes on a note of hope, with the thought that something of wisdom has survived all the death and destruction, and that nature recovers and humans rebuild, perhaps this time, avoiding the mistakes of the past. <br /> <br />Like all of Miyazaki's works, he strives for significance over saccharine sentiment. His films are gourmet meals beside the candyfloss of western animation, and I feel a sense of intellectual satiation and fulfilment from Princess Mononoke that western animation rarely invokes. This is intelligent animation for intelligent adults. One need not agree with Miyazaki's world-view, but discerning viewers can't help admiring the beauty, the vitality and the intelligence of it.

B00003CXCT|5.0|My girlfriend ordered the Star Wars DVD set for my birthday that already passed. I cannot wait to see it. All you cry babbies who complain Lucas \\"runied your film\\" need to get a life. There his films and he can do whatever he wants with them. He made the best trilogy ever and you guys want to complain about the new special effects. Would you rather see the string holding up the spaceship or would you rather see crisp, clear effects, as well as good story telling. <br /> <br />Other reviewers are correct. Everyone who is complaining either has ordered already (probably a year ago) or is too cheap to buy it and must lash out at everyone else. <br />
B000002KHF|5.0|What I can Say about Moondance. This music has been a soundtrack for my life. I first owned it on lp in the middle 70's when I was a stoned high schooler. Later when I met my wife we would always turn to this for those lazy Sunday afternoons together. We would attempt to dance to Moondance and get lost in the romantic lyrics. Caravan what else can i say the intensity and soulfulness stil brings me chills everytime I hear it. My wife has passed away at a young age after almost 20 years of marriage and this music is still being played. Yes it brings me back memories,hope and sadness. Thank you Van
B00028HBKM|3.0|I am one of those people who has loved Jesus all my life. I saw the Passion of the Christ when it came out on DVD and I couldn't finish it. It is a very moving experiance but it was so hard to watch your god being clobbered by a bunch of street urchins. I think that if you don't have a close realtionship with Jesus than this movie is perfect for you. But if you already love Jesus than I would not see it. Personally I don't need Mel Gibson to teach me about religion when I have about 100 copies of the bible in my house.
0385510438|5.0|You would think by now John Grisham would have \\"worn out his welcome\\" but he never does.  I fell in love with the characters in this book from the first page - there is someone in the book that nearly everyone can relate to.  While saddened at the end, the storyline, plot and outcome were all extremely well written and flowed easily through the entirity of the book.  Thank you again for another great read!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is a hell of a thing for me to say, since I'm usually such a harsh critic of film adaptations of Stephen King stories, but this is probably one of the few times (if not the only time) when I found the film to be better than the novella. Don't get me wrong, the short story is great, but the ending to the film is much more satisfying than the ending to the book. That is extremely rare. Often times these snotty, scumbag screen writers take it upon themselves to leave the most important story elements in, but to make the endings more \\"user friendly,\\" for want of a better term. Apt Pupil, and Dreamcatcher are two examples that come to mind. This frustrates me to no end, and I hate them for it. I wish these screen writers would all die of lung cancer. <br /> <br />But with Shawshank Redemption it's different. There are more story elements, and the ending ... I don't know, how should I say it? It peaks. I won't spoil it for you, though. Just read the book first, then watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean. Great flick!
B00009AOBI|5.0|This new directors cut of \\"Mask\\" blows away the orginal DVD release. I'm not going to go on about how great the movie is, by now everyone already knows that. I will talk about this edition however. First of all the print is far clearer and more crisp than the original DVD issue. Next of course is the inclusion of the original Bruce Springsteen soundtrack which was recorded but never used in the theatrical and home video releases. In it's place was a Bob Seger soundtrack which was great, but not the original choice. The movie was shot with Springsteen in mind and in fact Rocky has a Springsteen poster hanging in his room. But Bruce is back and used to great effect. His music was used to set a timeline which was lost when the Seger songs were used.  <br /> Also included are 8 mins of deleted scenes that have been edited back into the film. One of these scenes (which was sort of referred to in the theatrical version) is a song sung by Rusty (Cher) and Rocky (Eric Stoltz). The song is \\"Little Egypt\\" and the scene runs about 4 mins. The other scene is one where one of the bikers dies and his funeral, again this was never before seen.  <br /> And finally, there is an easter egg of sorts, at the very end of credits, after a minute or two, Cher comes on screen and speaks about the craniofacial disease and how you can help.  <br /> I've always loved the Seger music in the film, particularly \\"Roll Me Away\\" at the end. But the Springsteen music works very well too, and as I said, is used as a timeline. <br /> Director Peter Bogdonovich does a commentary as well as a 20 min interview about the movie. As I said in my headline, if you love this movie you will want this new edition, it's well worth it.
0452282152|5.0|Like many of the books I have read in my life, I picked up \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" after seeing the movie.  Unlike most people, I tend to like movie versions better (cf. \\"In the Cut\\", the film version is far superior).  But as for GWAPE, the movie, book, and painting are all works of sheer artistry.  After reading the book, I am even more impressed with the faithfulness (and also innovativeness) of the film version.  However, the book is certainly every bit as good. <br /> <br />Chevalier creates one of the sharpest, most endearing, and unforgettable portraits (no pun intended) of a literary heroine I have ever encountered.  Griet, the main character, is a complex and fascinating character coming-of-age in the Dutch Golden Age.  We see the stifling, gilded world of her master Vermeer's household through her young, undeniably female eyes, the eyes of a servant girl.  Lucky for us, Griet is observant, unusually clever narrator, and also simmering with a nascent, suppressed sensuality that makes the world through her eyes irresistibly fascinating, and perhaps a little voyueristic.   <br /> <br />Of course the interaction between Griet and the mysterious painter Vermeer is the centrepiece of the story.  In the book version of the story, Vermeer's attitude towards Griet, as well as his motives, are far more ambiguous and nuanced (whereas in the movie he clearly returned Griet's affections and was a \\"good guy\\").  Is Vermeer merely \\"using\\" Griet as coal to fuel his artistic fire, intending to throw her away after drive has been quenched, or does Vermeer truly \\"like\\" Griet more than just as a subject?  In a way, Griet's attitude towards his master is equally complex.  Is it love, lust, or a kind of awe/admiration, as an apprentice would have for his/her master?  Perhaps a mix of all three?  As the book is delightfully vague, we are left to ponder these questions on our own.   <br /> <br />Chevalier is a minimalist when it comes to writing, and it works fantastically forher.  The author pays exquisite attention to plot-significant detail without deluding the reader with unneccessary descriptions.  Much of the novel is written between the lines, clevery and subtly alluded to in a roundabout way.  Yet the language is simple and immensely readable.  It is modern, yet it fully succeeds in creating the illusion of 1600's Holland.  From a technical POV, Chevalier's skill as a writer is quite impressive.   <br /> <br />Girl with a Pearl Earring is a modern literary masterpiece that will absorb you into a seductive world of intrigue, hidden motives, and desire.  Although spanning neither continents nor centuries, this modest little \\"domestic thriller\\" is not to be taken lightly.
B00000JBCP|5.0|What can I say? This is just a great live album from a great band. The band sounds great live too. Everything, from voices, to choruses, to arrangements sounds great. There are live versions of many of the band's hits as well as some new songs like Jose Alfredo Jimenez's \\"Te Solte La Rienda\\" and Juan Gabriel's \\"Se Me Olvido Otra Vez\\". These two songs became big hits too. We also get live versions of past hits like \\"En El Muelle De San Blas\\", \\"Vivir Sin Aire\\", and \\"Oye Mi Amor\\". All I have to say about this album is that it's simply great as everything this band does. I totally recommend it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is not just an eye opener but very disturbing. It just tells you BUSH and CHENEY will go any length to make a fool out of American people. Simple words, he does not care about American people but how he and CHENEY can make money by kissing up to the enemy.
0792833236|5.0|Engaging, beautifully crafted biography of middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The cinematography employs monochrome instead of colour, a great idea because it perfectly mirrors LaMotta's dark persona. LaMotta is depicted here as a confused and paranoid pugilist, the film chronicles his career all the way to the championship belt. DeNiro is so convincing as LaMotta, that I ask myself sometimes if the personality he assumed for Raging Bull was how he must have once been himself. Another amazing thing DeNiro's sheer determination to accurately portray LaMotta in his post-boxing days by adding on fifty pounds! Let's not forget, he trained hard just to achieve the envious physique of LaMotta IN his boxing days! Joe Pesci is perfectly suited to the role of LaMotta's brother and manager, Joey, a quick talking, foul-mouthed but defensive and loyal sibling (and perhaps the only person that is allowed to critcise Jake and get away with it). Cathy Moriarty excels as Vicki LaMotta, Jake's supportive, strong and tolerant wife. <br /> <br />The movie is a classic example of near flawless film-making. Not only is the acting first rate, but the script, cinematography, direction and editing is also of the highest calibre. The screenplay is based on LaMotta's autobiography and of course that gives the dialogue a realistic and true to life feel. Elegant black and white enhances the already brilliant cinematography throughout the film, characterised by picturesque, static camera shots, sharply juxtaposed with the vibrant and kinetic camera work of the fight scenes. The quick, crisp editing to the boxing matches help accentuate the hectic, haphazard ambience of a real duel. Scorsese expertly creates some very tense moments throughout the film, such as the 'You're telling me all these answers Joey, but none of them are the right answer' bit and his use of slow motion at certain moments help convey LaMotta's interpretation of events, such as Vicki giving a normal, everyday goodbye kiss toa departing visitor, a sight that makes Jake immediately think that Vicki may be seeing that person behind his back. <br /> <br />Raging Bull's greatest virtue of all is that it is never boring. Even when watching it again, you'll not come across one boring scene. But than again this only came about because of the sheer talent and skill invested in the acting, direction etc. There are very few films that are first class in all aspects of production. Raging Bull is one of these.
B00012BD0S|5.0|Divine Wings of Tragedy(1997). Symphony X's Third Album.<br /><br />In the 90's, when you typically say the words \\"Progressive Metal\\", you will immediately think of bands like Dream Theater, Queensryche, and Fates Warning. Unless you happen to be imaginative and willing to discover relatively unknown bands, you wouldn't have heard of Symphony X( they do have a fairly large following in Europe). An intense mixture of Power Metal and Progressive Metal, albeit with thundering guitar melodies, imaginative keyboard flourishes, melodic vocals, fever-pitch drumming, audible(and cool) bass, not to mention lyrics and melodies that will make anybody who hasn't listened to the album complain that they are \\"Dream Theater rip-offs\\". Although they have the same distinct sound, that assumption would be wrong, since Symphony X sounds completely different when it comes to the *music*, not just the *approach*. While their previous two releases, 'Symphony X' and 'The Damnation Game' were relatively unknown, 'Divine Wings of Tragedy' broke them through to a larger audience in Europe and the U.S. Since I'd heard many good things about the band, I expected this album to be a blast. Was that the case? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Of Sins And Shadows- Symphony X hits all the right notes on \\"Of Sins And Shadows\\", with Michael Romeo's dark, pulsing guitar lick setting the song up for Russel Allen's melodic, epic, and mystifying vocals. Symphony X utilizes backup keyboards and choirs for an *epic* feel, and the end result is quite simply beautiful. An album's opener should always interest the listener, and this certainly does!<br /><br />Sea of Lies- A beautiful, epic, melodic, and metallic rocker, \\"Sea of Lies\\" sees Michael Romeo switching from a haunting, dark guitar riff to a mystifying rhythm guitar melody, and vocalist Russell Allen shines with his tales of \\"good and evil\\". Absolutely insane guitar and keyboard interplay here, and each musician plays like their possessed by the devil. Amazing.<br /><br />Out of the Ashes- Right from the opening, Symphony X is obviously trying to get the \\"medieval\\" and \\"dungeons and dragons\\" sound, and on \\"Out of the Ashes\\", Symphony X blends an unbelieveable mix of chugging guitar licks, medieval keyboards, dark vocals, and insane backup choirs to create another epic that sounds totally original. Imagine Dream Theater on steroids.<br /><br />The Accolade- The Divine Wings of Tragedy's other epic, \\"The Accolade\\" is a 9 minute epic, starting with an eerie opener that beckens back to medieval times, with a slick rhythm guitar melody and a flute opening. The song soon moves on to an upbeat, rhythmic, melodic Prog-Rock song, combining the epic keyboards, the wailing guitars, and the heart-breaking vocals to create another song that's brilliant, beautiful, and epic. The song never stays the same longer than 10 seconds, and for that reason, Symphony X leaves me speechless.<br /><br />Pharoah- The perfect ode to a pharoah's curse, \\"Pharoah\\" is a thrashy power metal rocker, combining the fever-pitch drumming, the guitar pyrotechnics and wizardry of Michael Romeo, and the decidedly dark, foreboding vocals of Russell Allen. What's amazing here is how Symphony X plays exactly what you'd imagine a song about Ancient Egypt to sound like. It may sound weird reading it, but once you listen to it, you'll see for yourself. I'm beginning to like Symphony X more than Dream Theater...<br /><br />The Eyes of Medusa- From the opening guitar chords to the symphonic keyboard melody, \\"The Eyes of Medusa\\" is a creepy, challenging Prog-Rock song that begs the question, \\"Can you look into my eyes?\\". Russell Allen's vocals are creepy and angry, and Michael Romeo shreds like a madman, not only on his solos but during riffs. Great musicianship, great song.<br /><br />The Witching Hour- Beginning with a rather cheesy(but still crazy) keyboard/synthesizer solo, you get the impression this is an upbeat, passionate ballad, but you'd be wrong! Michael Romeo's haunting, dark, creepy guitar arpeggios, not to mention Russell Allen's daunting vocals, make \\"The Witching Hour\\" a dark, mystifying epic even though it clocks in at a little over 4 minutes! Incredible musicianship, brilliant songwriting, and magnificent vocals. Can you take a hint? This song rules.<br /><br />The Divine Wings of Tragedy- There are no words. From the opening choir, to the hopeful ending, \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" lays down a story of love and adventure, using long musical interludes, passionate vocals, and incredible songwriting to blend a 20 minute masterpiece. Michael Romeo, from his emotional rhythm guitar to his symphonic electric guitar, remains forceful and creative throughout. Micael Pinella's keyboards provide an excellent backup, giving the music an added flavor, and keeps the music moving. Russel Allen, as always, is amazing. The bass is exceptional. Quite possibly, the best 20 minute epic ever made, and that's saying something around Rush, Yes, Dream Theater, and Pink Floyd.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Divine Wings of Tragedy' is a Progressive and Power Metal masterpiece, easily equalling or out-doing Dream Theater, while keeping a sense of creativity that sets them far apart from Dream Theater. All the instrumentalists are brilliant, with Guitarist Michael Romeo, Keyboardist Michael Pinella, Drummer Jason Rullo, and Bassist Thomas Miller each playing their instruments to their absolute best. Symphony X vocalist Russell Allen is all you could ever ask for, blending the vocals of James Labrie with Matt Barlow to create an amazing, melodic voice that stands out among other musical artists. The album's magnificent, but fair warning, the music is very cheesy, with Symphony X trying to sound medieval(at times) and a constant backup choir(Imagine Catholic church choirs circa. 1200 A.D.) always backing up the music. I don't think it takes away from the songs, but some might. Worth the title track alone, but the other tracks easily hold their ground!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF POWER METAL, PROGRESSIVE METAL, HEAVY METAL, AND SYMPHONY X!  DREAM THEATER, WELL, YOU JUST AREN'T AS GOOD! SORRY!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- Everything<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />The Odyssey- Symphony X<br /><br />Images And Words- Dream Theater<br /><br />Night of the Stormrider- Iced Earth<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!passionate ballad, but you'd be wrong! Michael Romeo's haunting, dark, creepy guitar arpeggios, not to mention Russell Allen's daunting vocals, make \\"The Witching Hour\\" a dark, mystifying epic even though it clocks in at a little over 4 minutes! Incredible musicianship, brilliant songwriting, and magnificent vocals. Can you take a hint? This song rules. <br /> <br />The Divine Wings of Tragedy- There are no words. From the opening choir, to the hopeful ending, \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" lays down a story of love and adventure, using long musical interludes, passionate vocals, and incredible songwriting to blend a 20 minute masterpiece. Michael Romeo, from his emotional rhythm guitar to his symphonic electric guitar, remains forceful and creative throughout. Micael Pinella's keyboards provide an excellent backup, giving the music an added flavor, and keeps the music moving. Russel Allen, as always, is amazing. The bass is exceptional. Quite possibly, the best 20 minute epic ever made, and that's saying something around Rush, Yes, Dream Theater, and Pink Floyd.  <br /> <br />Overall, 'The Divine Wings of Tragedy' is a Progressive and Power Metal masterpiece, easily equalling or out-doing Dream Theater, while keeping a sense of creativity that sets them far apart from Dream Theater. All the instrumentalists are brilliant, with Guitarist Michael Romeo, Keyboardist Michael Pinella, Drummer Jason Rullo, and Bassist Thomas Miller each playing their instruments to their absolute best. Symphony X vocalist Russell Allen is all you could ever ask for, blending the vocals of James Labrie with Matt Barlow to create an amazing, melodic voice that stands out among other musical artists. The album's magnificent, but fair warning, the music is very cheesy, with Symphony X trying to sound medieval(at times) and a constant backup choir(Imagine Catholic church choirs circa. 1200 A.D.) always backing up the music. I don't think it takes away from the songs, but some might. Worth thetitle track alone, but the other tracks easily hold their ground! <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF POWER METAL, PROGRESSIVE METAL, HEAVY METAL, AND SYMPHONY X!

B00005Q3KC|3.0|This album is really a must have but it could have been better if they had waited for borrowed heaven to be realeased and include its hits into the 'Best Of'. But still a must have for any Corrs fan!!
B0001L3LUE|4.0|I've read many reviews saying that this piece of \\"left-wing propaganda\\" is inaccurate and \\"dubbed.\\"  If this is so, why hasn't Robert McNamara said anything about his words being changed?  Also, books written by McNamara \\"WIlson's Ghost\\" and \\"In Retrospect\\" parallel what's said in the film.  Is this also \\"dubbed\\"?  Oh yeah, it's his words, on paper, that doesn't make sense.  And how about those audio clips of Johnson and McNamara?  Fake?  Quit it.   <br /> <br />Now, to the film.  This documentary shows clips of McNamara speaking on rules government should go through before engaging in war, which is to be used only under extreme circumstances.  There are also extra snippets of interviews in the special features.   This is a very revealing film, and shows interesting contrast between McNamara then, and how he sees things now.  This isn't \\"left-wing propaganda\\", save that for Farenheight 9/11 if you would be so conservative, this is McNamara talking about war, and what he thinks of it.  Don't listen to biased critism, it's rediculous and slanted.
B00003CXIY|5.0|To start off, I'm not even in college or even 15, and I loved this movie. I've seen old school and all the other same genre movies but this is my favorite right now. The story is told through Barry (Tom Green) giving a tour of Ithaca University. His complete lack of knowledge and smart-alec attitude make for some very funny moments some of which are in the deleted scenes on this dvd. After having the tourists \\"take a good look at this tree\\" and informing them that the 1954 on the library is \\"the address, ok? Wise a**.\\" he starts the story of Josh (his roomate) going out with the same girl since he was five then them going to different colleges then josh cheating on her on video tape then the tapes gets accidently sent to her \\"It was  a journey that would change their lives forever, the end\\" Tom Green says before starting the main part of the movie. I won't give away the ridiculus but funny ending though there are some parts which had my friends and I practically laughing non-stop. One of which is throughout the movie it switches back to Barry (Tom Green) feeding Mitch (Boa Constrictor) a mouse. He's uncontrollably obseessed with 'feeding time' and at one point says \\"he tastes good Mitch, he tastes good\\" Then puts the mouse in his mouth right before having the boa constricor swallow half of his arm. He starts yelling and swinging his arm around then the boa constrictor flys off and hits this professor in the neck. I won't give away the scene where they stay at Barry's grandparents house though I will says it involves marajuana, talking dogs, and medicine. Its been a long time since i've laughed this hard and that was probably when I first saw Old School (Will Ferrel) and Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks) which are also really funny movies. I have to say though Tom Greene and Sean William Scott often steal the show with 'feeding time' and \\"what? for this? Bob Hope can jump this bridge in a wheelchair so we can do it in a car\\"  <br /> <br />This movie isn't alot different from the rated version but it has some worth owning deleted scenes and trailers.  <br /> <br />This movie isn't really a 'family movie' but it will appeal to anyone who likes sometimes outrageous and bizarre humor. There is nothing too over the top that you wouldn't see in an R movie. Well then again Barry's grandparents... <br /> <br />This is a great movie and I hope this review will influence your decision. But parents, I reccomend watching this before or with your kids because there are some scenes that might be deemed inappropriate but it all depends on how easily you can be offended.  <br /> <br />I could go on for about a page and and half talking about this movie but i've got other stuff to do. So take my advice, rent or buy it(I think its worth buying) relax and watch this keeping in mind to view it as a comedy and enjoy some of the craziest scenes ever to glaze the often somewhat smudged screen of the fabulous world of comedy.
B0000CEB4V|1.0|The second disk was compressed so badly that it was extremely slow to play.  Therefore it sounded like a warped record.  I can't believe Amazon sold me such defective merchandise.  I love George's music but this disk was horrible.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Why does Britney Spears sing as if she is being struggled? It's aweful! And this album is totally boring! I prefer her first album better. She seems to be getting worse! The songs in the album are....BORING! I hope she gets some singing lessons and stops singing like she being struggled.
B000286S8S|4.0|The new greatest hits double CD is pretty good except they left out some pretty good songs like Humans Being, Dont tell me what love can do and Amsterdam. I personally think they should have done a follow up to Best of Vol.1. But I guess if you want all the good hits, you have to buy all their cd's. Overall still a damn good greatest hits album!
B00005JMUA|5.0|A few months ago, I saw 'Kill Bill, Volume 1,' and I liked it. I thought it was creative, and interesting. But there were so many questions left unanswered; so many important things ambiguous. <br /> <br />I finally saw 'Kill Bill, Volume 2,' and I am so glad that I did. This second one definitely answered all of those loose ends from the first film, while it also deals with the humanity of The Bride. If you thought that she was cruel and heartless in the first film, your opinion may change after seeing this one. <br /> <br />'Kill Bill, Volume 2' got a lot of comments on the fight scene between The Bride and Elle Driver. Although it was good, I found the fighting in the first film much more provocative. However, I must say I was glad that this film wasn't as gorey as the first one, which was good, but very bloody. <br /> <br />The cinematography must also be given props again, for creative shots, as well as a great mixture of color and black and white. It wasn't conisistent, though, with the first film, in also adding anime. The first film also deals much more with Japanese culture, especially seen through the language. This film features a little bit of Cantonese, but definitely nothing comparable to the linguistics featured in 'Kill Bill, Volume 1.' <br /> <br />But overall, I must say that I enjoyed this installment more than the first, actually. I'm not really one for blood and guts, and although this one featured some, it definitely wasn't to the same magnitude of the first. <br /> <br />Uma Thurman does an excellent job in this film. I definitely recommend at least watching this movie, but after you watch the first!
B0001906O0|5.0|Yes, I know, the headline is Depeche, but like Depeche, I can't get enough of The Cure lately. I wasn't a \\"cure fan\\" until 1989 with Disintegration, so I really started listening during the \\"downfall\\", but honestly, now that I just about have everything of theirs, I must say I can't understand why \\"Wish\\", \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" and \\"Bloodflowers\\" get such a beating. In particular \\"Wild Mood Swings\\", the B Sides from that album I think are some of the best of the 4 discs. \\"Home\\", \\"Adonais\\" and \\"It Used to Be Me\\" are breathtaking. I can't get enough of \\"Home\\". The \\"Wish\\" B sides are also amazing, LOVE \\"This Twilight Garden\\"!!! <br /> <br />While listening to disc one it struck me how \\"The Cure's\\" sound is still 100 percent relevant today. And their new album shows that they haven't lost \\"it\\" at all. The B Sides of the new album carry on with the tradition of the old, as good if not better than the album tracks.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Descendant of the whale rider and first born of the new generation, Pai's grandfather is far from loving when he learns that her twin brother, destined to become chief and to lead their people in order to keep tradition alive, died along with her mother. Although he's eventually come to care for her, he's always been somewhat distant and indifferent to her special capabilities, so time and time again she tries to win his affections - to make him proud of her - but she was not the son her grandfather was expecting and a part of him loathed her very existence because of that. However, despite his anger directed toward her constant defiance as she starts bending the rules, she also stuns the people of the small village she lives in as she practices and excels in the ways of the ancient custom.<br /><br />I haven't read the novel by Witi Ihimaera in which this movie is based on yet so I can't compare the two but whether they stuck to the book or not, \\"Whale Rider\\" is a sensational cinema experience all should see. Even if this isn't your thing, anyone with any sense at all will surely recognize this as a true work of art... A masterpiece, if you will. The acting is superb with riveting performances from the entire cast (most notably young novice Keisha Castle-Hughes who, IMO, should have won the Oscar for best actress!) in this compelling drama that overflows with boundless spirit...unlike many films these days that rather rely on big effects and hideous amounts of violence, or plenty of action to draw viewers in. From the beautiful cinematography of New Zealand to the Maori chanting and haunting soundscapes provided by Lisa Gerrard to further enhance the ambiance successfully brought to life here, \\"Whale Rider\\" is a gripping tear-jerker full of heart, and it will stay with you long after watching.
0553208845|2.0|The book had a message, and Hesse managed to say that message in so many different useless words of verbiage in all its 80 some pages. The absolute oneness of the universe, the transcendental power of time and space, the 'om' of all people and things: Hesse pounded it into the ground in the last 30 pages while Siddhartha was at the river. The point was gracefully made the first time and did not need to be repeated endlessly. A simple message that I've heard many times, and still no real proof to it...I was disappointed from what I thought would be a good book at the beginning.
B000002U9W|4.0|Before the band ever became famous, they sure were never afraid to do risks. It's amazing how much faith Harvest Records must have had in these guys to let them do something like Ummagumma (one of their most controversial albums, and certain to divide fans) and still allowed them to continue on. That's what happened and they followed Ummagumma with Atom Heart Mother. This was, in my opinion, the final album where they still had some of that '60s psychedelic elements left, before they decided to go full-on '70s with Meddle and the albums they released after. The album starts off with the side-length \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite\\". This is an all-instrumental piece, often quite atmospheric, dominated by Gilmour's guitar playing and Wright's organ. There is plenty of that Pink Floyd trademark too. Choir and horns are used too. The choir on many of the passages remind me of the Alan Parsons Project's circa I Robot, although this is seven years earlier than that album. In fact, some passages do remind me of how the Alan Parsons Project might have sounded like if they were around in 1970. In fact Alan Parsons engineered this album (as well as of course Dark Side of the Moon), so maybe that's how Alan Parsons got some of his ideas when he launched his Project around '75. The music really gets strange as it goes on, to the point where Rick Wright gets some strange sounds off a Mark II model Mellotron, before the original theme repeats itself. The second half includes three cuts, one from each member, and an odd band composition that divides the listeners. \\"If\\" was a Roger Waters composition. This one tended to be mellow and acoustic. Richard Wright gave us \\"Summer '68\\". Here the band was trying to harken back to their earlier, psychedelic sound. Although from 1970 and Syd Barrett was of course out of the band for two years and in '70 releasing two solo albums (The Madcap Laughs and Barrett), \\"Summer '68\\" could almost pass for a song off Piper at the Gates of Dawn that Richard Wright sang on. I had never really warmed up to David Gilmour's composition, \\"Fat Old Sun\\". It sounded like a rather non-memorable composition where he tries something with a laid-back country vibe. The final piece is \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\". It's mainly background sounds, with the occasional sound of people talking, acoustic guitar, and at the end, the band actually playing instrumental music. Another album worth having if you're in to Pink Floyd.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album has taken a lot of verbal abuse...perhaps rightfully so, perhaps not, but I don't see how it is even possible to call yourself a dream theater fan and talk down about the first cd. I think most fans would agree.    First lets talk about cd 1.  DT delivers an absolutely punishing performace on track 1.  It's fast and technical with lots of time changes.  It is quite possibly one of their best and not just for this album.  Next is 'blind faith'.  This has a more 'classic rock' type feel, but comes complete with a bone-chilling acoustic piano solo and plenty of percussive organ.  Misunderstood starts out a little quiet, but picks up later in the song.  It's a good change of pace for the cd and helps keep things moving.  The fourth song is entitled 'The Great Debate'...arguably the best song about stem cell research ever written ;).  As strange as it sounds, the song is actually pretty good.  It has a really cool sharp/techy-sounding guitar progression, and some great solos throughout.  After listening to it enough times though, you kinda want to slap the people talking at the beginning and end of the song.  Anyway, all of these four songs are between 9.5 and 14 minutes long!  Prog fans, what more could you ask for?  The cd closes with 'Disappear.'  It's a 7-minute downer song, but it's definitely worth the depression you'll suffer afterward.  In my opinion, cd1 is one of the best-to-date DT recordings right behind IAW and tied with SFAM.  It is probably their most progressive album.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.    As for the 2nd cd..... It has it's good and bad points.  I really like 'Overture.'  It's a 6 or 7 minute track which plays through all of the themes in the songs to come...no singing.  'The test that stumped them all' is a pretty cool song, kinda heavy, kinda funny. 'Solitary Shell' is pretty different for DT.  Petrucci has some pretty cool acoustic solos and there are some cool piano solos as well.  Cd 2 in general is not that bad for a fewlistens, but it lacks the replay value that many of the other albums have.  The lyrics are a little cheesy, but the musicianship is good.  Songs move quickly.  They all hang around the 4-6 minute mark.  It is still better than FII though.    To sum it all up, buy this album for cd 1.  It is everything DT fans usually look for in a prog metal album.  Listen to cd 2.  If you like it, its like an added bonus.  If you don't, take comfort in the fact that you didn't miss out on cd 1, which would be far worse.
0783226837|5.0|I've seen parts of this movie many times when it's shown on TV and I decided to get my own DVD 2 months ago. Since then I've probably seen it 30 times. This movie is really a classic. All the main characters are lovable and they have great chemistry together. A must have in any DVD collection.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|i love this album, i listen to it at home, in the car, in my ipod. every song on here is worth listening. 10/12 of the songs makes you bang your head. cannot get enough. if you like metallica, you'll like a7x. quoted from their website,the album is \\"punk rock with melody, metal's white-knuckle intensity and powerful wails, combined with unflinching lyrics and an adventurous and epic spirit, make the band stand truly alone.\\" this is the type of music that your parents hate, and hate more when you listen to it. rebel!
B00028HBKC|5.0|(...)        In English:  This is the third review that I do on DVDs and this one is sure a good exception to my rule of only writing reviews on books.   I saw this film last Sunday with my wife and son. We are from a Catholic family and my wife is deeply devout to the Virgin Mary. Since the beginning of the film, we suffered a lot, given the amount of suffering by Jesus that is showed in the film by the Australian director, who, we heard, also belongs to the Catholic faith.  Some people said that the film was obnoxious to the people of Jewish extraction, because Jesus were not be condemned if were not for the Jews who were all the time against Jesus. Others said that the suffering of Christ in the film was much bigger than it really was in reality. My wife, who is always keen on religious matters, says that the film was what is there in the Bible, and that Christ suffered a lot more not less in reality, and that the blame is to visited upon the shoulders of all we, humans, not only on Jews or Romans.  To finalize, I would like to congratulate all the films team and most specially to the people that had the good idea to have Aramaic, Hebraic, and Latin dialogues.
B000268QB2|2.0|Let's all chant together folks, \\"Rip-off!  Rip-off!  Rip-off!  Rip-off!\\"   <br /> <br />First of all, the cd is overpriced for an EP.  This should've been about 3 or 4 dollars cheaper (or had more material on it to justify the price!). <br /> <br />But the real injustice?  These guys have recyled the work of the Zombies, and are trying to pass it off as \\"ground-breaking,\\" \\"hip,\\" and \\"totally 21st Century\\" - all phrases used directly by Mr. Chaplin to describe his band's music. <br /> <br />I'm tired of these '60s-inspired bands - like Jet, the Hives, the White Stripes, and now Keane - essentially repackaging older (did someone say, ahem, better??) music and acting like today's kids are too dumb to notice.  The smart ones aren't.
B000002KCF|5.0|this lasts.  I listened to it nonstop when it came out - the 70's? - and it remained a fond memory, tucked away.  a few  years ago I picked up the CD and BOOM! top of the charts, all over again.  Worth savoring again and again.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I read a couple of bad reviews on this album and thought that Alan Parsons went nuts and made a horrible sounding album. Well I got the album the other night and were those reviews wrong. I've been a fan of the group since 1979 when I graduated from high school and the album that got me hooked was I Robot. I just loved how his music combined orchestra and choirs in a rock format. <br />  Even though this album replaces the orchestra and choir elements with some more electronic sounding effects, the album is still brilliant. Crafted as only Mr. Parsons can do it. The music still sounds very much like typical Parsons. It has layered sound, songs that build slowly than becomes more lush,sound effects (ie rainstorms, barking dogs) and electronic choirs.This is probably his best producing effort to date. <br />  The first song features David Gilmour and it sounds very floydish. Listen to the great deep bass drum on the song L'arc En Ciel. The last song Chomolungma builds slowly and has a great climax to end the album. Overall excellent. <br />  For anybody who thinks that it too electronic, consider that his first 3 albums (Tales, I robot and Pyramid) were also considered to be electronic.
B000000W6X|5.0|This is a terrific album dating from 1995. Massive Attack use many different vocalists and instrumentalists, and the overall style is slowish urban 90's music with beguiling rhythms and cool voices. It is well produced and quite sophisticated. The title track Protection is one of my all-time favourite tracks by anybody. Tracey Thorn from Everything But The Girl sings this excellent song. Other ones I like are the slow groove Heat Miser and the unusual rhythm of Karmacoma, which I grew to like . There's a live recording of Light My Fire, which proves that Massive Attack are a good live attraction as well as being great in the studio. I listen to this album frequently and I can strongly recommend it to any people who like great music. <br />
1400049628|5.0|I have already amassed a huge stokpile of supplies for when the final zombie apocalypse comes.  Thank you Mr. Brooks for your tireless research into this subject.  Mr. Brooks should be awarded the Pulitzer for this piece.  The thing most people don't know is that this book was only put in the \\"humor\\" section so it would not create mass panic.  I found the book in the Current events section after a book clerk winked at me and pointed to the book.  He obviously wants me to be one of the survivors. Please understand everyone, that this book is NOT A JOKE AT ALL!!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|Let's, for a minute, take away the fact that these guys are the best rock musicians on the planet. Say James Lebrie is a below average singer, not as bad as Axl Rose or Brain Johnson, but below average. Mike Portnoy is only about as good as Ringo Starr.  Jonh Petrucci is about as good as Angus Young and John Myung only knew a few notes on the bass. Doesn't sound like too good of a band, does it? Believe it or not, it would be good. The point I'm trying to make is that despite being unbelievable players, the song writing is just as unbelievable on this cd. Every song is top notch.  We all know that the members of Dream Theater are the best at what they do.  However, if you are not into great musicianship, this record is still a 5 star cd. With half of the songs on this 8 song collection clocking in at over 7:00, you can see why radio would want nothing to do with it. It makes no sense why anyone in the world would not want this one in their collection. If Elvis was the 50's and the Beatles the 60's, Floyd and Zeppelin the 70's, Van Halen and Bon Jovi the 80's. These guys are the 90's, as well as today. Don't be silly and just buy this. If you don't like it, check your pulse, (if you still have one), and check yourself into an insane Asylum.
0316168815|4.0|Sebold did a wonderful job, I think, writing something extremely fresh.  To have an entire story told from the viewpoint of a person who has been ripped out of the story was ingenious.  Just as ingenious was to start the book with Suzie's murder.  It was so gruesome and horrible that if we had already developed compassion for the characters we could not have read further.  Much better than diluting the brutality of the murder for the comfort of the readers.  Because of her technique, I was able to feel the pain of the survivors.<br /><br />Another thing I loved was how she explored the individuality of heaven.  Brilliant!<br /><br />Great imagination!  Great way to tell a story!
B00003CXCT|1.0|The guy insists on bringing the original films down a notch by redoing them. Sorry, but I have disliked Lucas ever since I tried to sit through Episode One and I only persevered for a grand fifteen or so minutes because I was waiting, hoping, and praying that Jar Jar would get set on fire. He didn't (I don't think) and I went back to sleep. Go to hell, Lucas. You have made a mockery out of something that was sentimental to me.
0812550706|5.0|This book is really really really really good. I have never liked science-fiction, I'm typically a fantasy fan, but this book changed my mind. It's extremely well-written, original, and engrossing. This author is also good at making you feel what the characters feel. When Ender cried, I cried. When Valentine (his sister) felt guilty, I felt guilty. I wanted to strangle anyone who hurt Ender (the main character) because he quickly won my respect with his intelligence. If you ever read any book, read Ender's Game! PLEASE!
B00003CX5P|1.0|George Lucas tried just a little to hard to equal the succes of his first trilogy. The acting is atrocious, the computer effects stand out, and jar jar binks is annoying! Is this really the same man who made the brilliant mythological film of 1977 - which was good not because of its special effects but because of its humanity?
B00005MAM2|1.0|I know there are others out there who agree with me (not many, I'm sure) but I must warn those who are reading all of these five stars. This movie is overrated. It isn't the end-all film or perfect anime it's made out to be. Personally, I found it absolutely pathetic at best. The characters are hardly memorable, with little history and even less depth. The plot is paper thin. The voice acting (in the dubbed version anyways, that's all I've brought myself to watch because this movie was so disappointing.) is awful, everyone sounds much like Steve Erkel with a head cold.<br /><br />In my humble and personal opinion, this is the worst movie I have wasted two hours on, whether anime or live action, in a long, long time. I recommend renting this movie, or finding a friend with a copy, if you really want to see it. If you do, for some reason, waste the money to purchase it, you may contact me, and I will give you some very fun Martha-Stewartish tips to turn the DVDs into a coaster for your drinks. :)
B0002IU988|4.0|I heard rumors that guitarist Mark Tremonti actually solos on this release.  I was very hesitant to purchase the cd because of the general aversion to Creed.  Mark smokes, here, and the rest of the band is tight, energized and focused following the departure of Scott Stapp.  The new singer has excellent range, and an awesome hard rock voice.  Mix a little Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) with Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and Geoffrey Tate (Queensryche) and you have Myles Kennedy.  This is such an improvement over Creed, I cannot overstate the quality of the music.  This is not NU- anything, but good, solid, hard driving hard rock.  Bands that stress the re-evolving quality guitarist are going to put nu-metal and rap rock out of business.  It's about time.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm saying this to those who have said things like who wouldn't want to see these films updated with all the new technology. Well I and it looks like many feel that way. I think others have said this but I will say it again. It's not the new scenes that bother us old Star Wars fans it's the way they're being offered. We watched movies that were great for their time and that's why we love them. Great things don't need change if they did they wouldn't have been great to begin with. I'm only 26 years old, and have seen both versions of the films. I obviously saw the older versions first when I was a kid, and those are the ones that I love. If I were to have seen the special editions first my thinking might be different but I didn't and it's not. All I'm really saying is is it that hard to release two different versions of the dvd set? I mean can't they just clean up the old one, surely they can otherwise there wouldn't have been any special edition to release. If Fox and George Lucas want to do this right, they will release the original set and a special edition set. It can't hurt, they did it a while back on vhs, and I know people who have both, so it can only be a good thing money wise. I understand about the continuity thing, but it's null and void when you try and change things people have already seen and liked. Then all you accomplish is people saying things like \\"what the hell was that?\\" and \\"That isn't right.\\" So again I say release both versions and then everyone will be happy. jIn fact I wouldn't be surprised to see a set with all six movies in it in about 2 years or so. Maybe by then there will be a choice. I can't wait for the third installment, and I have to say I liked the last two movies as well, but in my mind the original three will always be the best and all I want is a dvd set of the movies I grew up with.
B00005NC66|5.0|Godard is like a jazz musician. He takes a simple story (a cliche even) and flips it around turns it inside out and creates a revolution on the screen. This is one of the most satisfying things to watch happen.<br /><br />Though not everybody will like his films - they are still ( you must admit) ingenious and uncompromising.<br /><br />Watch this movie and have fun with it.
B000025RX4|5.0|\\"And\\" doesn't sound like the rest of Johnny Winter's blues releases.  The album opens with the psychedelic, hard driving \\"Guess I'll Go Away\\" which has flanging similar to the Nazz's \\"Open My Eyes\\".  Things slow down with the Traffic cover \\"No Time to Live\\" and \\"Am I Here?\\" written by drummer Randy Z (Derringer's brother).  I always preferred this version of \\"Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo\\" since it was released first.  Derringer's and Winter's guitar styles mesh together in the same way that Duane Allman and Dickey Betts complimented each other.  Distortion is present on the original master tapes, but it doesn't ruin the great music on this CD.  I recommend the remastered version by Steve Hoffman.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Despite the fact that critics pretty much dismissed the Girl Next Door, it's not half as bad as some have said, but the film's schizophrenic tone hurts it plenty.  Is it a coming of age teen comedy?  Or is it a teen sex comedy a la American Pie?  We never know for certain, but the Girl Next Door is still fun to watch nonetheless.  High school senior Matthew (Emile Hirsch) falls hard for his sexy new neighbor Danielle (the luscious Elisha Cuthbert), until he learns of her adult film past.  Hijinks ensue, with two of Matt's friends along for the ride as he tries to get Danielle away from her producer/ex-boyfriend (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant in a showboat performance) and the adult film world.  It's funny to a point, but the film gets more and more unbelieveable as the film unfolds.  Other than that, the Girl Next Door is worth seeing, and not at all as bad as many critics have said.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|\\"The Kids are Alright\\" is everything a rock documentary should be, edging out the Beatle's \\"Anthology\\" and the Rolling Stones \\"Gimme Shelter\\".  The Who in their prime were a devastating band, fueled by Keith Moon's relentless energy.  Watching Moon's chronic alcoholism progress from each period is painful to see. This director's cut is superior in every way to the edited VHS version.  The bonus DVD has a revealing interview by Roger Daltry that clears up many Who myths.
B0000640SA|4.0|The movie's premise works. The movie makes you think. Even after you see the whole movie, you wonder if you really understand what happens in the movie. The movie makes me question my notions of truth and reality, perception and emotion, love and trust.     The acting is good. The primary and secondary actors performed their roles well. Everybody is believable. The editing and sets were not great, but the story is what draws you in.     The main twist of the movie is the main character does not have short term memory. The technique of telling the story backwards draws the veiwer into the main character's confusion and frustration. The story gradually unfolds not only the mystery, but the protaganist's dismal and painful life. However, the protagonist keeps his sense of humor. It is an amazing experience.     The movie is an unique experience and well worth watching.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Having watched Dancer In The Dark which left me emotionally cold and visibly affected, I expected no less from Dogville. One big difference between Dancer and Dogville is that the latter features just a stage set; no outdoor scenes. The story happens on a cludeo boardgame-like setup with well-demarcated lines and labelled areas that represent each charcter's dwelling place, roads and landmarks etc. The emphasis therefore falls on the actors' acting and good acting you will find here.<br />Nicole Kidman's character stumbled into Dogville following some mobster's chase. A man, by the name of Tom, sheltered Grace, cared and fell for her. Tom tried to get the townsfolk to let Gracestay, so she began to help out with the residents on a daily basis for a small sum of money in order to gain their acceptance.<br />However, things take a turn for the worse when wanted posters of Grace were put up in Dogville. The residents made more demands of Grace and the men made more advances. Her escape plan fell off tangent, but Dogville made a costly mistake.<br />Nicole's acting is consummate. You can witness her emotions rollercoaster to great heights and lows and even the supporting cast gave great performances. The film was accussed of being anti-American and may have cost its chances at the Oscars but director Lars Von Trier should not be bothered for he has crafted yet another masterpiece, the first of a trilogy with the second, Manderlay to be out in 2005.<br />This film is utimately about human flaws and vulnerability; the human nature of taking advantage of the disadvantaged and also the strength to survive. Nicole plays the role of God trying to help mankind realize their good but wrongdoings must also be punished for.<br /><br />A masterpiece!
B00001OH80|2.0|Well this was a massive disappointment. Having loved 'Loving The Alien' and thinking 'Blue Jean' was quite good, I bought this album, thinking all the reviews previously were exaggerating the quality of the album. Unfortunately, I was Wrong. <br /> <br />The title track is horrible, just 80s pop at its worst, although i quite like the soft-reggae 'Don't Look Down', and the cover of the Beach Boys classic isnt as bad as you would think. For the second half of the album, things take a definite turn for the worse, although there is a nice brass accompliment for a couple of the songs. The last 3 tracks are terrible by Bowies standards and completlely unmemorable, im listening to Dancing With The Big Boys now, and I cant pick out a chorus at all.  <br /> <br />Overall, a pretty bad album, the only songs i would listen to out of choice are Loving the alien, God only knows and Blue Jean, 2 of which are on the Best of Bowie album. AVOID.
B000002IQW|4.0|I bought this album the day it came out and I subsequently wore out that cassette.  I have been too long without it.  Musically and aggressively this is Skid Row's best work.  Except for \\"18..\\" and \\"I Remeber You\\", the rest of the songs on the popular debut album are filler.  Slave to the Grind is solid.  The three balads are right up there with \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Cemetary Gates\\".  MOnkey Business kicks so much d***d arse I still can't get enough of it.  I wish I had seen Bach when he was on Broadway doing Jeckle and Hyde.
0375422307|5.0|I almost NEVER read books. Well I'm a student and that's all I have to do at school so reading for fun is not really my thing, but Persepolis seemed interesting to me when I saw it at my school's book store so I bought it.. At first I thought I'm going to quit reading it just like any other book I bought before but I was wrong. I finished this book in ONE night!!! This book was something else, I could relate to most of the stories because I was born way after the storeis in this book take place. I should'd say this, but my eyes where 'watery' after reading this book. So I got the second book today and I hope it's as good as the first one. I fully recommend this book to everyone, at least I enjoyed it a lot I hope you will too!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is a great CD.  Even though Yulia(or Julia) and Lena went around saying there were lesbians(which they're not... in fact, Yulia is now a mother from her BOYFRIEND), they're still great singers and that doesn't stop this from being a great album. <br /> <br />Not Gonna Get Us -9/10 <br /> <br />All the Things She Said -10/10- Even though this song was played nonstop on the radio, same to the vid on TV, I still love it. <br /> <br />Show Me Love -9/10- I like the way the song begins.  The phone is ringing.  Music begins as someone picks up and speaks in Russian.  Then, the songs begins.  Wonderful music and melody. <br /> <br />30 Minutes -10/10- A little light music plays, while we hear two laughing.  Then, singing begins, with wonderfully deep lyrics. <br /> <br />How Soon is Now? -8/10- Not a favorite of mine, but still good to listen to. <br /> <br />Clowns(Can You See Me Now?) -10/10- My personal favorite.  Wonderful music and melody.  Really gets down in your mind. <br /> <br />Malchik Gay -6/10- Really rarely will I listen to this one. <br /> <br />Stars -5/10- Reminds me of supermarket music.  Not that great. <br /> <br />Ya Sholsa S Uma -10/10- The Russian counterpart of All the Things She Said.  I think it sounds better in Russian <br /> <br />Nas ne Dagoniat -10/10- The Russian counterpart of Not Gonna Get Us.  I love this version, too, over the original. <br /> <br />Show Me Love(extended version) -10/10- LOVE the intro to this.  Though it's a variation on the original, still awesome. <br /> <br />Lena and Yulia are amazing singers and I hope they'll be coming out(hahaha... coming out) with more albums.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I ONLY gave it three stars because it is Star Wars and Star Wars is the greatest movie ever made.  I will not, however, be purchasing the DVD set.   <br /> <br />Like it has been said before...I smell a rat.  Or, at least, a blatant milker.  George Lucas, who has long ago realized he could crap in a box, label it \\"Star Wars\\", and make millions, has decidedly screwed up his original masterpiece even more.  I agree with what others have already said, there will probably be an \\"original release\\" within five years.  So, it is with a sad heart and sadder eyes that I will pass up this DVD offer and once again fire up the old VCR and watch my originals for my annual viewing.   <br /> <br />A few questions I have to for the \\"let Lucas stretch his creativity\\" camp.  1.  Do the additions add anything whatsoever to the story line--or are they simply stoking an aging moviemaker's ego?  and 2.  Obi Wan dies old, his ghost is old.  Anakin dies old, after finally returning to the Light Side and giving himself to the force, and his ghost is...young???  Am I the only one who sees this makes no sense???  Oh, I'm sure there's some lame reason--\\"you see, his ghost is actually him before he was turned to the Dark Side.\\"  Great Lucas--just great--I'll see you in five years when you release the originals. <br /> <br />Speaking of milkers, when does The Return of the King come out?
6305508550|4.0|Although Beavis and Butthead's creator Mike Judge gave birth to this hilariously accurate film, it parallels Dilbert more than B&B or King of the Hill.  Great story, funny pranks, and terrific character development, even if you don't live in a cubicle farm, you'll enjoy this flick.  If you have more than three Dilbert cartoons pinned up in your workplace, you need to see Office Space.
B000002UY3|5.0|I have listened to Mazzy Star since I was all but a young lad in High School. Hope Sandoval is the female Jim Morrison of heartbreak. <br />She Hangs Brightly: A little more lively than the others, but   ultimately lacks the strength that the others hold on you. <br /> <br />So Tonight That I might see: This is a cd that could be very emotional for some people, and the PERFECT makeout cd for others. <br />This was the album that originally took me completely, Its very nice and relaxing. Quiet nights alone by the fire, bottle O' wine. <br /> <br />Among My Swan: WoW. This just proves that they got better with time. Unfortunately this was their last. A perfect Cd to listen to if A: you want to get over someone. Or B: If you want to stew and be miserable for a week. Very powerful, I suggest this cd STRONGLY.  <br /> <br />Mazzy Star is definately worth owning. The way you take the music will souly depend on your mood and additude.
0792843584|5.0|I saw \\"Heaven's Gate\\" in the original 4 hr. version in a tiny theatre in Blacksburg, VA, shortly after it flew in and out of the mainstream. I was on vacation and this was a box of Godiva cocoa candy for me.It is a story within a story - the point that most people have overlooked. And it IS only a movie.The friendship between Kristofferson and Hurt lingers due to common bonds (i.e. money, background, societal mores of the times). Kristofferson sees the dichotomy of what is really happening and acts. After seeing Sam Waterson in that part I can't watch him even in a commercial.That's how powerful the characters are.Ella is an indication of what is to come for women, the right to vote. Independent, fierce, she creates a space that is the apex of the triangle with the two men.Nate dying in the burning cabin penning her a love letter in death is in direct contrast to his focused killing of the immigrants. This is a chromograph paen to a time that few today can truly understand.  People want their movies in fast food bites with very little to do but nod their heads today sadly. This movie brings you straight into that time. Slower paced,more deadly than you can ever imagine, only the triumph of the human will survives. Yes, it is long. So is \\"Gone With The Wind\\". Art is not always popular nor truth. I fell in love with this movie having grown up in the West.Inaccuracies are inevitable in any retelling of a story.But \\"Heaven's Gate\\" shows the robber baron attitude in the latter part of the 19th century that was a preamble to an accepted form of behavior even to this day.And the score is available on CD.\\"Heaven's Gate\\" is worth a watch. Along with the \\"Wild Bunch\\". And then you might understand how the West was really won.
B000002LGQ|5.0|After listening to this album once again, I almost cried.. Why you must ask, well this album has been put together very well, with the album name,the first single and the video to Like A Prayer made me love Madonna more than an artist and a legendary Goddess Of Pop, she is so creative in every aspect of the way.. With the release of Like A Prayer was just a smart move from a woman which has been out for 3 decades, this would have to be one of the greatest songs from her in a long shot..
0792833236|5.0|Even the best films of the 2000's can't compete with \\"Raging Bull\\". This is a classic masterpiece that completely avoids the sugarcoated melodrama of today's movies - both those coming from Hollywood and from Europe. <br /> <br />\\"Raging Bull\\" shows the power of carefully crafted filmmaking. Scorsese's film is a rare example of what a true visionary can achieve - and it should serve as the cinematic inspiration of all aspiring filmmakers.

B00028HBKM|4.0|I don't see how anyone could call this movie antisemitic.  A jew helps Jesus carry the cross, tries to bring him water, etc.  Jesus himself is a jew!  The early christians in this movie, if you could call them that, are the ones that betray and desert him.    This movie is about people in power, particularly religious people in power, always thinking they are right.  These people are always the first to hate and to shed blood in the name of religion.  History is ripe with this: the spanish inquisition, the burning of \\"witches\\", the condemnation of Galileo, ad nauseam.  Even the high priests in the KKK are guilty of this.    Those leaders in the movie that hate Jesus so much could be from ANY religion.  It is irrelevant.  What is relevant is that they have power and that they hate.  Jesus NEVER teaches hate, even though many christians out there do hate when they should not.    It's a good movie.  Not perfect, but what is?  Mel could have left that devil guy out.  I thought that was a little silly.
B0000C23DO|5.0|For anyone's music collection, this Cd is really the only studio compilation needed by the Grateful Dead.     A treat to listen to, this Cd is a delight for any listener.   I wish it would get more air play.
630575067X|3.0|I'm in the crowd that's quickly becoming the bane of the Star Wars fan community. One of those pesky people that saw the film at age 7 when it first erupted onto the big screen. Leading the charge in support of getting new films out (which I consider our sacred duty, after all we waited over 20 years for it) we were also the first to shy away from them when they didn't match up to our expectations.<br /><br />Enter The Phantom Menace (TPM), a Star Wars episode that feels quite a bit out of step with the original three. Visually this is a stunning movie, and I think that this facet is what it will be remembered for. The lightsaber duel between Gui-gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul makes the one in Star Wars: A New Hope look like a geriatric aerobic workout in comparison. The podraces were absolutely awesome. The set design and costumes were also very well put together.<br /><br />*scratches his chin contemplatively*<br /><br />And now for the constructive criticism portion of my review. After all if fight correography and CGI graphics were all that were necessary to make a movie beloved then I have no doubt the \\"Final Fantasy\\" movie and \\"Mortal Kombat\\" would be ranked up there with \\"Citizen Kane\\". Sorry Mr. Lucas :(<br /><br />1. If there's any one nit I have to pick with this movie and \\"Attack of the Clones\\" it would have to be the lack of chemistry between characters. Luke, Leia, and Han didn't have to be top-notch actors in their respective roles in the original 3 movies, but any doubts we had about their acting talent was put aside by the great chemistry that they had on screen. It really worked, and while I like each of the individual actors in TPM I simply don't connect with any of them. And for the record I get the impression they don't really connect with each other either. That magic is missing, and it plagues this movie and AOTC as well. I guarantee you that if this element was present in TPM it would receive a much better rating.<br /><br />2. Whoever wrote the individual lines for the actors needs to be blasted. And don't set them for stun. Through most of the movie we're bombarded by wooden acting by people that you almost get the impression had to be poked to be reminded that it was their turn in the script (that chemistry thing again). Jake Lloyd's lines were absolutely unbelievably bad, although the movie being more directed towards kids I can let it slide.<br /><br />3. Every movie needs a sidekick. Chewbacca was Han Solo's steadfast companion. His lines consisted of grunts and growls, but the movies were designed so that you always knew what he was saying because Solo conversed with him in that special way. Now we have Jar-Jar Binks, part Murphy's Law victim, part reggae aquatic-Bob Marley guy, but 100% annoying. I remember grimacing in my chair in the theater as he recited his routine. I feel really bad for the guy who voiced him, probably the most disliked person in the western hemisphere. Therein again since this was designed to be mostly a kids movie I can even let Jar-Jar slide a little bit. But not much. Hand me that blaster, would you?<br /><br />4. The plot is a bit deep for Star Wars fare. I'm not saying that the first 3 were too simple, I'm saying that the concept was very straightforward. Good vs. Evil, dad versus son, lots of nuance and a whole pile of special effects. This movie takes the shoestring premise of the first three films and turns it into the Gordian Knot. We have the Trade Federation blockading Naboo for some reason. Then there's the future Emperor who orders them to invade. Why? And what's with all the Senate intrigue? Why explain midiclorians (sp?) as the prime mover of the Force? Why is Yoda so unlikeable in this one? And most of all why make a movie so obviously aimed at a younger audience have so many plot points and loose ends?<br /><br />In the end the first 3 movies will always be revered. I'm not so sure about this one. It's liable to end up being like a not-so-good episode of your favorite TV show. You watch it because even though it's not good you need to see it to get to the next episode.ike a not-so-good episode of your favorite TV show. You watch it because even though it's not good you need to see it to get to the next episode.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Mr. Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9/11, was technically good.   I found to be very interesting, and I believe it will go down as one of those films that could change the world or at least the views on America.     When tackling this type of subject matter, Moore should acknowledge his role for making more inner-hate within our county and around the world. I think people should see this movie, But should also know how much propaganda went into making it.    Before and after the movie I was on the fence on who I was voting for. But after present events, new findings, the GOP convention, and not relying solely on bias broadcast news (CNN), I have decided to go with BUSH for president.
0784011680|5.0|Brilliant and splendid story of the raising Charlot till his stardom with meticulous insights about his private life  love affairs . From start to end a delightful and poignant film .<br /><br />Attenborough repeated another bio after his successful film Gandhi and made a superb movie with a magnificent cast and extraordinary and vivid locations .

Not so with Tuf.<br /><br />He could level any galaxy and bring any empire to its knees...but instead chooses to make a modest living helping out worlds in trouble... (and yes sometimes he even likes to play God and render moral judgments) - but hey we have to forgive him for that...we all need a little fun from time to time...<br /><br />This book is a series of short stories that were written by GRRM over about a 10 year span, yet they seamlessly flow together...

Tuf has to save a world from overpopulation (twice), save another world from sea monsters like no one can imagine, solve a worlds cruel practice of gambling on a wicked sporting event, and protect a world from a biblical prophet who has a unique ability to create plagues...Fortunately he has the help of his massive starship, his massive brain and a few cats...<br /><br />An amazing read...When I look up at the stars now I wonder when Tuf will come and solve the problems of this world...for he is long overdue...<br /><br />While we wait - I suggest you read this masterpiece to be reminded that one person can make a difference...<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Martin - and since Tuf never gets the recognition he deserves - Thank you Mr. Haviland.
0792833236|5.0|Raging Bull puts you into Jake LaMotta's world of hopes, desires, and terrible upsession. Martin Scorsese makes the movie a enjoyable experience that makes you understand what you need in order to get a title shot, keep it, and deal with everything else. The powerful, memorable piece was a perfect example of true perfection. The opening scene when it brings you to when he is a older man who gets ready to talk to a crowd about his experiences and ended right before he was going out saying \\"I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.\\" Raging Bull is the most commemorating experience in American Film history. This was an experience which will make you cry and understand that this movie is truly a perfect picture. <br />

B00005JMUA|5.0|If you want to like this movie, you've got to give it time.  You've got to watch it again and again while getting good and sauced.  For some reason, alcohol makes it good, to paraphrase Homer Simpson.  This movie, seen once, is crapola.  Seen fifteen times it is a masterpiece.  There is a scene toward the end where Uma Thurman comes slowly down the stairs to confront Bill.  There is a western playing on the tv and soft music on the soundtrack.  The tv western moves to the rhythm of the soundtrack, and, when Bill puts down the Hanso sword with a sharp clack, this is exactly in time with a character getting punched in the face in the western.  This is extremely subtle film-making.<br />Addition 9-15: Allright, I notice some of you have been giving my review unhelpful votes - which is rare for a positive review.  My review is very helful to you ingrates.  It is a suggestion that you spend time watching a real work of art, rather than the dry, pretentious drivel that liberals are prepared to call art.  But don't let me stop you.  Go watch Dogville and spend 3 hours watching people walk around in a \\"set\\" composed of chalk drawings on the fuggin floor of trees and dogs, labeled \\"tree\\" and \\"dog\\"  (It would have simplified matters if they had just labeled the movie \\"dog\\" but whatreyougonnado).  See, this gimmick, liberals will go mad for it.  Its exactly the kind of schtick they think is real highbrow.  Why?  Because its annoying as all getout, just like Shakespeare.  Lets just say this review is a sign at a fork in the road.  You decide.  And if you opt for Dogville, hey, Give John Kerry a vote for me, uh pal?
0553579908|5.0|You cant keep the title forever...just ask Ali or Tyson... and so it is with Tolkien. GRR Martin is the new king of the fantasy world with the Song of Ice and Fire. (And his short stories are wonderful too)<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's superb fantasy epic continues in consummate style as bloodshed and alchemy lay waste the Seven Kingdoms in this second volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. The Iron Throne once united the Sunset Lands, but King Robert is dead, his widow is a traitor to his memory, and his surviving brothers are set on a path of war amongst themselves. At King's Landing, the head of Lord Eddard Stark rots on a spike for all to see. His daughter Sansa is betrothed still to his killer's son Joffrey -- Queen Cersei's son, though not the son of her late husband Robert. Even so, Joffrey is now a boy-king, Cersei is his regent, and war is inevitable. In Dragonstone, Robert's brother Stannis has declared himself king, while his other brother Renly proclaims himself king at Storm's End -- and Eddard Stark's fifteen year old son Robb wears the crown of the north at Winterfell. A comet in the night sky, red and malevolent, the colour of blood and flame, can only be an omen of murder and war. Stannis's child Princess Shireen dreams of dragons waking from stone. And a white raven has brought word from the Citadel itself, foretelling summer's end. It has been the longest summer in living memory ...<br /><br />GRRM kills of major characters as if they were extras...Its just awesome! He once said that he wants a cast of 1000... but i question if that will be enough given the title of the fortcoming fourth book and the trends in A Storm of Swords...<br /><br />Read this again as you await the \\"Feast for Crows\\"...<br /><br />Thank you George.
0375507256|2.0|Normally, when a book goes nowhere I put it down and start reading another book.  This book, however, showed great promise so I kept reading.  I anxiously awaited a clever ending that would tie all the pieces together and give me the \\"WOW\\" I get at the end of a good book.  Such an ending never arrived.  The book \\"petered out\\" into psycho-babble.  I felt like the author had five unfinished novels that he threw together to meet a contract requirement.  This book was a waste of time.

0156027321|5.0|If you are the type who has ever struggled with religion or purpose in your life, you will find a friend in Pi Patel. The allegory and metaphorical subject matter coupled with the magical realism of the text creates what LITERATURE is made of. This is the type of wonderful novel that will be read in college courses in the future. It is a profound example of how such complex and open subjects can be relayed to the reader on a very simple and balanced wavelength, all the while creating a thrilling reader experience. I highly recommend this novel!
0698119347|3.0|Can a series really be said to be ripping off the James Bond franchise if its characters constantly reference and mention him?  After reading Anthony Horowitz's first book in the phenomenally popular \\"Alex Rider\\" series, the answer is an unequivocal yes.  These books are catching on like wildfire amongst those kids captivated by the spy genre.  So I read through the first book and found it to be 007 in miniature.  Or rather, it's early racist 007 in miniature.  Chock full of fabulous gadgets, great chase sequences, and enough explosions to satisfy even the blood-thirstiest amongst us, it nonetheless suffers from an overabundance of clich&eacute;s.  \\"Stormbreaker\\" is a fun time, no question.  Just flawed.<br /><br />\\"When the doorbell rings at three in the morning, it's never good news\\". That's a good first sentence.  After being duly informed of his uncle's death, young Alex Rider (who had been adopted by his only living relative Ian Rider after his parents' death) harbors some suspicions about the cause of his uncle's demise.  Though to Alex, Ian Rider was merely a humble banker, some roundabout snooping reveals that Rider's death had more to do with a spray of bullets hitting his car than the reported \\"no seatbelt\\" cause given by the police.  Suddenly Alex finds himself enmeshed with M16, Britain's equivalent of the CIA.  Hired by this mysterious agency to spy for them (much as his uncle once did) Alex must investigate multi-millionaire Herod Sayle.  Egyptian by birth, Sayle wishes to donate his newest computer the \\"Stormbreaker\\" to every schoolchild living in Britain.  It's up to fourteen year old Alex to unlock the secrets of \\"Stormbreaker\\" and find out what really is going on with the mysterious Mr. Sayle.<br /><br />They say that if a gun appears in the first act of a play, you can bet your sweet bippy it'll be used by the third.  Similarly, if a huge aquarium containing a Portugese man-of-war appears in the early chapters of a teen spy novel, you can bet it'll come into play again before the end of book.  \\"Stormbreaker\\" is full of these interesting but obvious little ploys.  I wasn't surprised in the least that the villain owned a huge aquatic tank containing a poisonous sea creature.  Nor did I blink when his henchman was a fellow by the name of Mr. Grin, with no tongue and scars that traveled up the sides of his face in a hideous smile.  What did surprise me was the villain himself.  First of all, this book is full of white people.  Only one person of color appears in this tale, and he turns out to be a psychopath.  Originally born in Egypt, Herod Sayle saved the lives of two British tourists when he was a child and was unofficially adopted by them as a kind of thanks.  Having grown up in England he is, therefore, every white bigotted Englishman's worst nightmare.  This book is basically saying, \\"Never trust a foreigner!  You can take them into the bosom of your country and give them a wonderful life with freedom and opportunity and they'll STILL try to murder you in the end\\".  I would expect that kind of lesson in a book written in 1920.  And I might be a little put out to find it in a book written in 1960.  But to find it in a book written originally in 2000 isn't just offensive.  It's downright bizarre.<br /><br />So it's racist.  And how's the rest of it?  Fine n' dandy.  You can't beat Horowitz when it comes to fancy fighting and tricky gadgets.  The author has a nice grasp on cutting things to the close.  There's aren't any girls in this book that aren't either motherly or mannish (sometimes both) or end up being cold-hearted villainesses.  So don't enter into this expecting a love interest for Alex.  At least, not yet.  I was also impressed by how believable author Horowitz made Alex.  Coerced into working for M16 against his will, Alex acts like a relatively normal guy with, admittedly, abnormal abilities.  Everything he does you believe he'd do.  That's a mark of good writing.  Making people with dark skin out to be the villains?  Not so much.<br /><br />Spy novels used to hinge on xenophobia to a certain degree.  These days spy movies, television shows, and books are capable of creating villains that exceed such short sighted expectations.  That's why it's so offensive when books like \\"Stormbreaker\\" rely on archaic stereotypes to create animosity.  The book could have been just a fun jaunt into some great spy techniques.  And, for the most part, it is.  Just don't expect any great insights from this particular spyish outing.  And don't be surprised by its repugnant opinion of people of different nationalities.  Apparently, that's perfectly fine.kin out to be the villains?  Not so much. <br />  <br />Spy novels used to hinge on xenophobia to a certain degree.

B00028HBKM|5.0|i actually had a harder time watching this DVD film on my HD big screen TV than in the theater. the transfer is of course top notch. so top notch that i had to take a few breaks from the home viewing of this movie because of the graphic depiction of Christ's suffering. the special effects people did an excellent job making this movie. mel gibson did an equally excellent job of showing man's perverse nature (the flogging), not to mention man's cruelty and stupidity (crucifying an innocent man). at times this movie was very hard to watch, and because of morbid curiosity hard not watch as well. like him or hate him, JC was a good man. how anyone in their right minds could condemn a man so good is beyond my comprehension. he talked the talk, and walked the walk until his dying breath. what a pillar of strength he was.  <br /> <br />the academy of arts and sciences should really consider giving James Caviezel an Oscar nomination for his performance of the man our civilization started a time table for.  <br /> <br />warning: keep this DVD out of young children's reach. if you are 'on the fence' about whether or not to let your child watch this film, you may opt to put it aside until he/she is old enough to handle this movie's subject matter.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I will admit, I'm a die-hard maggot, and when I bought this CD first day and gave it a listen, I was thinking sell-outs. I slowly liked it more and more, and when I saw them at Ozzfest I realized they definitely did NOT sell-out. They were more brutal than ever, and Corey's voice was way better than on Vol.3. It sounded more like old Slipknot, which made it more enjoyable for me. But I have finally accepted the new Slipknot and truely realized what an awesome piece of music Vol.3 is. The whole CD is the highlight, whenever I listen to it I go all the way through, no skipping tracks. I have a feeling the next CD will be better though. So get it if you like Slipknot, don't get it if you don't.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I saw this movie at my local theatre with two friends of mine (one of them a strong liberal, who loved Bowling for Columbine) who had recently joined the navy, and who have many family and friends over in Iraq, they walked out of the theatre totally offended at his depiction of our troops. <br />Whenever I read on amazon or anywhere, people who say that this movie \\"Exposes\\" the truth, I just have to laugh. If everything said in this movie is in fact a Confidential Government Cover-up, how is it that the only man who knows it is an un-educated 50-year-old virgin with a camera and a big mouth? Doesn't that seem odd to any of you? <br />Truth is, every \\"fact\\" presented here is true, but it's not a conspiricy, these aren't confidential government secrets, these are just a series of happenings from the past four years with all the rational explanations deleted, everything is presented as confidential for cinimatic purposes. I can't believe so many people were fooled. Just thinking about all the people reading this right now and dismissively shaking their heads out of fear of truth, I can't help but laugh at them all. Enjoy living in your delusional world MM fans, I wish you would realize that Mr. Moore is rolling naked in your money right now and giggling like a school girl.
B000002552|5.0|It wasn't too many years ago that the \\"Big Pink\\" was sold. No one goes to visit it as if it were a shrine to music like they go to Memphis, Tennessee. The Big Pink stands unrecognized, unappreciated, an unknown mystery. A place where six musicians, embodied with the knowledge and traditions of music's past and music's future played to the ghosts within its basement walls. They melted it down, boiled it good, stirred it up, spit it out, changed its myth, and rode it to town. You will not here any music that sounds like this music.  It stands alone. Go ahead and compare it to anything that you have heard. I dare you. This music gives no hope, takes no hope, promises nothing and yet gives everything. I wish I could have been there. I wish I could have been there.  \\"The Basement Tapes,\\" as released by Columbia is a fragment of the songs that were recorded in that house in upstate New York, but it's enough to give us a taste of this hidden masterpiece. Material strongly influenced by Harry Smith's \\"Anthology of American Folk Music,\\" conceived during a time when the country was being pulled in every direction. It's a place in music where Dylan has sought to return,to remake himself over once again. This very well could be the product of a one-time phenomenon. This very well could be the greatest music I have ever heard. I dare you to listen, to really listen. Go ahead, walk down the stairs, watch out for the cords, and have a seat.
0792833236|5.0|It's true, no description can even come close to doing this film justice. I'd say it's just a complete and utter tour-de-force in every aspect of filmmaking; but that's a bit of an understatement, if you ask me.

No this is not just a guys movie but a movie where an average guy can go and have fun with an ex porn star is like a dream come true... or is it? As we see in this movie that with all the excitement that may come from being with a porn star, there are some bad things that can happen.... oh wait a lot of them. This is one comedy that will make you laugh, cry and yes, can turn you on as well (Elisha just has that look). So get a hold of this movie and not only enjoy the movie, but the special features as well since there are a lot of them.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|As can be expected by her family name, Sofia Coppola does not disappoint with a touching view of two individuals from different generations whose lives are in the same sort of place, the feared limbo between deciding what to do with your life and fearing responsibility.<br /><br />Though a little slow, the film is touching.  It was easy to care about both characters and see why they were such good friends.  But it is the comparison between the crisis of the post-college generation who ask \\"What else is there?\\" and the crisis between mid-lifers who are also not sure what is left that won me over<br /><br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging actor whose career has come to a near stand still.  He travels to Tokyo to make his riches from appearing in commercials.  Feeling lost both from the euphoric environment of Japan and the fading long-distance relationship between his wife and children, he spends most of his leisure time either at a bar or trying to understand and enjoy Japanese television.<br /><br />Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young, recent college graduate who has followed her husband, an equally young photographer.  Bored and disenchanted, Charlotte wanders through Tokyo, managing a few smiles at the sights and the people.<br /><br />Only after these two lonely hearts meet do their smiles grow and their lives feel less in limbo.  When they are away from one another, the two suffer from their usual insomnia and their frowns return.  But together, their smiles are almost consistent and their lives shine.<br /><br />The genius of the film, however, is the story.  Harris is clearly suffering from a sort of \\"mid-life crisis.\\"  But his situation is not unlike Charlotte's, who is also suffering from a similar crisis, where she is not sure where she wants to go next.  Both fear adulthood and wonder if it is really worth the risks.<br /><br />I recommend this film to others who enjoy film as an art rather than as entertainment.  There are no big action scenes and no impressive special effects, but the story is like spending time with your closest friends and finally feeling life's worth.tion scenes and no impressive special effects, but the story is like spending time with your closest friends and finally feeling life's worth.

B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon, \\"Election\\") is your average dumb blonde. Living in a sorority, Elle shops, talks, and is obsessed with pink like any other girl. Even though she's rich, there's one thing she has that she can't buy with money--her charming boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis, \\"Pearl Harbor\\". But when Warner suddenly dumps her because he wants a \\"smart\\" girlfriend, Elle is determined to prove him wrong by getting into Harvard. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, Elle gets enough good grades to make it into Harvard! But unfortunately for her, everyone there makes fun of her because she's too \\"pink.\\" However, everything's about to change. Elle is picked to be a lawyer for a real trial. And if she can make it through this case, she'll be able to prove that there's more to blonde than meets the eye. <br /> <br />LEGALLY BLONDE is such a funny movie, and it will get a laugh out of everyone. It may seem like just another teen movie, but it has everything to make a perfect comedy. Something I really liked about the movie was that the acting was great, although Reese Witherspoon improved as the movie went. So all in all, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This DVD collection is an absolute must-have for those who love The Godfather trilogy. Quite simply this is likely one of the greatest sagas ever produced, novel and moviewise.<br /><br /> The first Godfather from 1972 is considered the greatest movie ever made and while I sometimes question it being 'THE' best movie of all time, there's no doubt on my mind that this is indeed on of the best movies of all time and a cinematic achievement like never before. Starring the late great Marlon Brando, it's the story of the head of the Corleone family named Vito who has made many business dealings with gambling and criminal enterprise and his son Michael Corleone wants nothing to do with the criminal Underworld but when Vito is critically wounded in a failed mob assassination attempt, Michael is unwillingly pulled into the mob underworld.<br /><br /> The second Godfather movie is like almost no other movie because it serves as both a sequel as well as a prequel to it's predecessor. Set in the late 1950s Michael COrleone who was pulled inot the mob underworld has been setting his grip as the Don of the Corleone family and has transformed into a cold-hearted crminial mastermind. At the same time we flash back to the 1900s through the early 1920s where Vito Corleone's background and past come to light and we witness his rise to power and how it really shows Vito from a totally different light from the first Godfather movie.<br /><br /> The third and finale of the three is the most controversial and most unfairly criticized of the three. An aging Michael Corleone who has had a very dark past has been making links to the Vatican and has been trying to redeem himself from his past sins and wrongdoings but has been held back by younger gangsters who aim to take over the business and criminal enterprise from Michael and prevent his son from inheriting it. This finale is the darkest and the most depressing of the three and perhaps that's why it's the least favorite of the three by many but for me, this is nonetheless a really great conclusion to one of the best saga's ever done.<br /><br /> To really understand these movies you will need a lot of patiences and they need to be seen in order in order to understand what they are about but if it succeeds, these are ultimately highly rewarding classics that will never grow tiresome. This DVD collection is highly recommended.three by many but for me, this is nonetheless a really great conclusion to one of the best saga's ever done.  <br /> <br /> To really understand these movies you will need a lot of patiences and they need to be seen in order in order to understand what they are about but if it succeeds, these are ultimately highly rewarding classics that will never grow tiresome.

B0002T7ZKW|1.0|\\"American Idiot\\" is not a serious song, and it's certainly not political. Unless, of course, you consider the lyrics \\"My f*cking America\\" to be political, and if you do, you need your head checked. Just because a band shouts obscenities when mentioning a country doesn't make something political. If you want a real political song that fits the recent day (and past), listen to The Offspring's \\"Baghdad\\", which still holds as true as it did fifteen years ago when it was released. That song still holds its own today, and proves that history of America (along with its ongoing mid-eastern wars, hatred, and arrogance) repeats itself. Green Day are just trying to cash in on the fact that this year is an election year.
0780624890|4.0|Wesley Snipes, with his natural background in martial arts, fits the role of the Dhampir (half human/half vampire) Blade perfectly.<br /><br />The action is intense, the music is great, and the main villain is as evil as they come.

B000003TA4|2.0|<br />Whoa there, cowboy. It's people like Paranoia below who gives decent Nirvana fans a bad name. The guy calls all people who hate Nirvana \\"hermaphrodites\\", and then proceeds to tell them to go \\"f*ck themselves\\". Looks like we have another ignorant Nirvana fan. I guess Paranoia never heard about Kurt's dying want for people to have love and empathy for one another, or for his plea for people to respect one another no matter what color, type of sexuality, or any other flat-out differences they may have. When it comes to Nirvana's music, I like a handful of their songs, but I'm not going to lie and say everything they've done is gold, because only about 20% of Nirvana songs are worth listening to more than once. Songs like \\"Pen Cap Chew\\", \\"Tourettes\\", \\"Scentless Apprentice\\", \\"Oh, the Guilt\\", \\"Anorexorcist\\", and the unbelievably horrendous \\"Raunchola\\" from their 1/23/88 live show flat-out suck. Most of \\"Bleach\\" sucks too. No matter how much you want to deny it, there's a fine line between grunge and heavy metal. Most \\"real\\" grunge sounds identical to heavy metal, and I despise it all. On \\"Bleach\\", Kurt and the boys had the heavy metal sound, and all they needed to complete the image was the hairspray and spandex. \\"Bleach\\" had way too much metal riffage for my liking. Actually, any amount of metal riffage is too much for me, and as you can see, I despite heavy metal and anything that aspires to sound like it, including all of The Melvins and half of what Nirvana did... but thank godess that \\"Nevermind\\" sounds better than \\"Bleach\\". <br /> <br />
B00005JKWJ|3.0|This is a very watchable vampire sequel but falls short in many ways to the first movie.<br /><br />The suped up vampires didnt really strike a cord with me and i was wishing the director kept to the traditional vampire myths.<br /><br />The pack of 'death dealers' were also unexciting and every member fit a stereotypical action role from the Asian ninja to the tough as nails scruffy guy to the towering mass of muscle guy.<br /><br />The main villain, Nomak, was pretty good but paled in comparison to Deacon Frost. And the main female role in this movie was very sub par. Actually, all female roles have been extremely sub par in the Blade series... and hopefully this will change with Jessica Biel in Blade 3.

All of their albums are amazing of course, but this one really ecompasses all of what Green Day is. Catchy tunes and clever lyrics; classic Green Day! I have never even done one of these reviews before but as i have had this album for three years and have never grown tired of it, i just had to express my love for it!! Any time I am feeling less than happy, i can put on this CD and feel instantly better. There is NOT ONE bad song on Dookie! It is the best album ever and anyone who tells you otherwise is insane!!! Trust me on this one and buy this CD!! You won't regret it!!!

Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. Of course I like any hero who likes cats. Quite frankly it is one of the best comic booke movies out there. Daredevil, LXG, and Punisher were so so.<br /><br /> The DVD special features were great. I had a better understanding of the character and the movie afterwards. I will buy the directors cut.
0385512104|4.0|I thought that this was an engaging, fast-paced read and a truly interesting character study. I would recommend it to most anyone. <br />  <br />The only reason I didn't give this novel 5 stars was that I was a bit bothered by the main character's total and complete lack of emotional response. I have worked extensively with autistic children and have a hard time dispelling the myth that they are robotic, unfeeling creatures who lack human emotion. I can't speak for every child on the autistic spectrum, of course, but in truth the vast majority of these children demonstrate the capacity for loving relationships and strong emotional bonds, even if this is expressed in an atypical way. I felt that Christopher's emotional disconnect from his family was sad and not necessarily representative of most autistic kids. <br /> <br />That point aside, an interesting story told from an intriguing point of view.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The wild and funky guitar chords strike certain emotions I can't explain in words.  The lyrics give the listener a sense of anger and resentment toward political groups by truly \\"Raging against the Machine\\" but at the same time giving them something pleasing to listen to from beginning to end.  The talent of these guys is demonstrated in each and every song as their guitar skills are incredible and on beat.  Some songs like \\"Calm like a Bomb\\" make me wanna stand up and just pump my fist wildly in the air.  Each song is great to its own degree and \\"Guerilla Radio\\" is one of the best songs on the album.  The chords strike emotions in my soul I cannot describe, and it is a shame this band is no longer together.  The words sometimes go right past my comprehension, but i still can appreciate its message.  The politically rebelious attitude portrayed in every single arrangement of guitar solos and screaming of the lead singer is evident.  This CD speaks for itself, I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for music that is heavy and doesn't hold back.
B00002MHRW|5.0|Traffic's first two albums from 1967 and 1968 are both timeless. \\"Mr Fantasy\\" was their debut; their second was simply called \\"Traffic\\"<br /><br />Steve Winwood had left Spencer Davis Group in early 1967 to form a new band with Dave Mason, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood. Both Winwood and Mason were extremely talented songwriters, and they each wrote a single hit for the band prior to the release to this album. Both great singles ( \\"Paper Sun\\" and \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" ) were included on the original US mono-version of the album, which makes up the second half of this CD-release<br /><br />Traffic succeded in combining Winwood's jazzy/bluesy style and Mason's melodic songwriting style with the new pshychedelic trends of which the band themselves were very much a part of.<br /><br />The album is perfectly produced by Jimmy Miller, and though these recordings are nearly forty years old, they sound as fresh and crisp as ever.<br /><br />Most songs were written by Steve Winwood in collaboration with Capaldi and Wood; and their songwriting is incredibly inspired. Songs like the opener \\"Heaven is in Your Mind\\", the moving \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\", \\"Mr Fantasy\\" ( terrific guitar solo from Steve ) and \\"Coloured Rain\\" are classics. They also show a humouristic free and easy attitude on tracks like \\"Berkshire Poppies\\" and \\"Giving to You\\"; which gives the album the variety that is needed to make it a classic.<br /><br />Dave Mason wrote 3 songs, all tracks are fine, but his contributions here are not so significant as on the follow-up album, which included his classics \\"Feeling Alright\\" and You Can All Join In\\". They are all more or less in the same vein as \\"Hole in My Shoe\\", though none of them not nearly as catchy.<br /><br />Before the album was released in the US Dave Mason had left the band ( there were some disagreements over the musical direction ), so two of his songs were excluded from that release and exchanged with the 4 songs from their 2 singles. This made the American 12 tracks version an even stronger album. The B-side \\"Smiling Phases\\" was another great Winwood/Capaldi/Wood composition that deserved being included in the first place.<br /><br />There are some interesting differences between the mono and stereo versions. The guitar-solos on the two mixes of \\"Heaven is on Your Mind\\" are completely different; funny that they exchanged the great solo on the UK version with an obviously less inspired on for the US release; could be a mistake? Minor differences can be on most tracks.<br /><br />Interesting that Dave Mason isn't even credited as band member on the US album cover.

It was also the first release of the Stones new contract with Virgin Records.  None of the songs appear on either Hot Rocks or More Hot Rocks.  The album seems mis-titled because it does not include any of the single releases from 1989-1993 and in fact does not include *16* UK single releases from this time period.  It was an attempt to release the most the most popular of the Stones hits since they left Decca (London in the US) in 1971.  A better title would have been \\"Some Stones Hits '71-`89\\", but then who would have bought an album with an ambiguous title and the last hit 4 years earlier....other than those rabid Stones fans, anyway?  Well, this is what happens when you have such a huge catalog of hits and you try to do a greatest hits album.  Look at all the stuff that had to be left off of the 2002 release 40 Licks.  If they ever release the entire Stones catalog as a box set it will have to come in a trunk that comes with a dolly to get it out of the store. <br /> <br />These songs are the most popular from the Rolling Stones Records releases.

The characters are painted with a very broad brush of superintelligence yet they all behave supermoronically, instead.  And the technology described is something only a truly clueless n00b would applaud.  I realize it's supposed to be *fiction* and the research was conducted prior to 1998, but come on, Mr Brown, with all due respect, get a clue.  The author should stick to what he knows and anything regarding crytography, encryption and/or high tech is most assuredly *not* it.  Leave the sci fi story telling to Stephenson & Gibson.

Get this one and be amazed at how great the Bard was and continues to be. I checked out one of my local video stores the other day.....there were 15 Shakespeare videos in the hot rentals section.....not bad for a guy who died 5 centuries ago.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Okay, of course I haven't seen the DVD's yet, so the 5 star rating is simply because it's Star Wars.(Well..it USED to be Star Wars) SOME of the retouches I don't mind (IE: It always drove me nuts that you could see the cells around the spaceship models in ANH). But some are just there because ILM is saying \\"Look what we can do!\\" (The most obvious,and obnoxious case of this being Jar Jar Binks).<br /><br />  Now,I'm not sitting down with the tape here, so I might not get the dialouge exactly right, but I know I'll get the gist of it enough to demonstrate that Han Solo was justified in shooting first.<br /><br />GREEDO: \\"Perhaps I can take you to Jabba myself\\"<br /><br />SOLO: \\"Over my dead body\\"<br /><br />GREEDO:\\"I was hoping you would say that.I've been looking forward to this for a long time!\\"<br /><br />  There! Now, in the same situation,wouldn't YOU fire first. Granted, Han was preparing his balster as soon as Greedo sat down, but can you blame him?It's one scene that needed NO tampering with! It just doesn't look right.
6301661737|3.0|As I watch more & more Akira Kurosawa's movies, it comes to my realisation that in actuality, his works are rather Noh-influence.  His scenes are perfectly framed & yet, the frames are expansive enough for his performers to do what they meant to do.  I used to think that the performances are somewhat pushed but as as we have a tendency to be mellowed by age, as I watch the movie second time around, I am pleasantly surprised that the outcomes aren't what I think they used to be.  The performers do what they meant to do in their own natural rhythms & together with a glorious settings (where everything seem to be right where they are), with dosages of old Japanese values, whallah, you have a concoction of Kurosawa movies that we are endeared to.  Kagemusha is based upon the true story during the Warring Period between three factions.  Fighting scenes are at best patchy but it's still an awe-inspiring site as most of what we have these days are all CGI effects.  Kurosawa's movies tend to touch upon death, our mortality, the fragile beauty of life.  As war rages on, the scene of soldiers coming to a standstill listening to the haunting sound of a solo flute performance is at once poignant and beautiful at the same time.  There are moments like that in Kagemusha.  It's also a life in parody as the shadow warrior, a non-blood would have done so much better than the original warlord's own son, whose impatience would eventually lead his Takeda Clan to imminent doom.  A movie not to be missed especially for a Kurosawa's fan.  Mind you, this movie would eventually be superseded by Ran, which I feel is his work in maturity particularly for this form of epic war genre.  Highly recommended.
B0001BPREM|3.0|MONA LISA SMILE revolves around Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts), a graduate of UCLA who has moved out east to teach art at Wellesley College in 1953. Katherine is a feminist and is astonished when she realizes that Wellesley is basically nothing more than a finishing school for girls before they get married. Besides the usual goals of teachers (to broaden students' horizons, provide them with an educational foundation to build their lives upon, give them a platform to leap further in life than they would otherwise, etc.) Watson decides she will do everything she can to show her girls a different way of living and that they don't have to just get married, but that they can have a career and the joys of a married life without actually being married.<br /><br />The imagery in the film is quite beautiful, capturing the delicate colors and moods of the time and season. Most of the acting in the movie was exceptional, especially with the younger actresses. Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Ginnifer Goodwin were delightful in their roles as students of Watson. Their characters were some of the best things the movie has going for it.<br /><br />Julia Roberts, however, is another story. Julia Roberts was simply Julia Roberts; she failed to capture anything of the essence of Katherine Ann Watson. Instead, she seemed to be using the movie as her own personal catharsis. I like Julia Roberts, but MONA LISA SMILES is not one of her finer moments.<br /><br />Structure-wise, the movie attempts to be the female version of DEAD POETS SOCIETY (Several of the film's promoters made that reference many times). Alas, MONA LISA SMILE doesn't even come close to being a female DEAD POETS SOCIETY. DEAD POETS centered around a universal theme of carpe diem. MONA LISA SMILES could have went that route or another universal way, but instead decided to be a political and feminist movie by showing the evils of the traditional role of woman as wife and mother. Besides alienating all the males in the audience, the film alienates over half the female population as well. So, Mona Lisa frowns instead.ng all the males in the audience, the film alienates over half the female population as well. So, Mona Lisa frowns instead.
B000002LEU|5.0|Well, Joy Division have to be one of the greatest bands that ever lived. This retrospective shows some of that. I was a huge fan of their studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, as well as the half-\\"outtake\\"/half-live album Still, which I consider their most overlooked release. The only JD which you truly don't need is Permanent, I'll never understand that one. <br /> <br />As for this one, it contains two tracks from the out-of-print debut EP, which is a pleasant surprise for fans like me who didn't get exposed to JD in their time (well, I've been for only three years). It begins with the classic track \\"Warsaw\\", as well as the fact that singles like \\"Atmosphere\\" appear here, where classics you can find elsewhere of the band, like Unknown Pleasure's \\"She's Lost Control\\". This one, along with Still, makes me wonder what they would have done, but New Order were pretty good even if not as consistently as this band. <br /> <br />Ian Curtis was one of my favorite vocals. It's distinctive of other vocalists, and the emotion could be heard in it. My favorite Joy Division tracks, \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" and \\"Dead Souls\\" are here. The latter has a classic bass line, and Bernard Sumner's riffs are really awesome. It's no big surprised that NIN would later cover it, seeing as the riff sounds something like what Trent Reznor would be influenced by. You shouldn't have to read lame/cheesy reviews like this to know why they are one of the greatest acts I've heard. Buying and listening will be the work needed. I honestly have never encountered a person in real life who didn't like this band.
B00006AUIG|4.0|Very few films from Hollywood rate as truly creepy or horrifying. I can think of a few off the top of my head, the best being Stanley Kubrick's terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's \\"The Shining.\\" The George C. Scott vehicle \\"The Changeling\\" is capable of striking a few chilly chords, as is the intensely unsettling British made for television version of \\"The Woman in Black\\" (not Hollywood, I know, but it counts in the general sense of scary movies). Obviously, a few more are floating around out there, with the most recent addition to this select list being Brad Anderson's 2001 film \\"Session 9.\\" Here's a film that completely snuck in under my radar. I don't know if it had a theatrical release three years ago, but if it did I never heard a word about it. Since I don't go to the movie theater on a regular basis, preferring instead to enjoy all types of cinema on DVD in the comfort of my home, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that I heard nothing about Anderson's picture. But after watching this creepfest, I figured SOMEONE would have told me something about \\"Session 9.\\" Maybe a friend did; I was quite busy with school back in 2001 and didn't have as much time to watch and talk about films as I do now.<br /><br />The plot outline here is rather simple-at least initially. A hazardous waste company run by Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan) accepts a contract to remove asbestos in the decrepit Danvers building. It's a big job, one of the biggest this little company has ever had, but Fleming's financial and personal life is in a bit of a pickle and he really needs the work. Against the better judgment of his co-worker Phil (David Caruso), Gordon promises to finish the job in one week instead of two or three. His promise is incredible considering he only has himself, Phil, Mike (Stephen Gevedon), Hank (Josh Lucas), and Jeff (Brendan Sexton III) to help with the assignment. These guys are good, but are they good enough to finish this massive undertaking? Perhaps, but as the work week progresses issues arise that cast grave doubts on completing the task. For one thing Fleming starts acting weird, and not in an amusing way. He's distant and spends a lot of time fussing around with his cell phone. The behavior of the boss exacerbates divisions between Phil and Hank, divisions started some time before when Hank wooed away Phil's wife. Too, Mike has his issues. He's a smart guy who dropped out of law school and has since drifted aimlessly through life. As for Jeff, he's just trying to learn the job and make a little money at his uncle's business.<br /><br />The whole situation rapidly deteriorates once Mike discovers a series of tape recordings in a room in the basement. These recordings consist of interviews conducted by the hospital staff with Mary Hobbes, a patient who suffered from a multiple personality disorder. Mike becomes fascinated with the weird, eerie voices on the old reels, and sneaks away from work whenever he can to listen to them. In the meantime, strange noises in the hospital start distracting the other workers. Then Hank disappears after discovering a cache of coins and other trinkets in the basement. Perhaps something not of this world inhabits the dark recesses of this depressing building. Perhaps somebody or something means to do great harm to Gordon, Phil, Mike, Hank, and Jeff. Or maybe it's all in their heads. One thing is for sure: danger lurks around every corner, nothing is as it seems, and the end is sure to deliver bloody shocks in a way not apparent until well into the film.<br /><br />Brad Anderson did a couple of several very smart things with \\"Session 9.\\" First, he chose an amazingly creepy location for the film, the abandoned and run down Danvers State Insane Asylum in Massachusetts. This building reeks of doom and gloom, and Anderson's camera captures the wide-open spaces of the wards as effectively as it peeks into the dank, dark recesses of the basement tunnels and rooms. Occasionally, the camera zooms overthe edifice from high above so we get an idea of the sheer immensity of this structure. Second, and most importantly, Anderson hired a cast of great actors to fill critical roles. The standout here is probably Caruso, an actor I've never had an affinity for in his other roles. In \\"Session 9\\" the actor's seriousness and increasing concern as the weirdness becomes too much to bear carries a ring of truth. You could see a real person doing the things Caruso's character does. Mullan's good too, and he's downright ominous when the final revelation emerges in the end. What doesn't work as well is a conclusion that's too pat and, frankly, somewhat confusing. What exactly happened at Danvers? What do the nine session tapes have to do with the final disaster? Is there any connection between the institution and the actions of the characters? \\"Session 9\\" raises more questions than answers.<br /><br />The DVD contains many extras. A commentary track, an alternate ending, deleted scenes, and a featurette help provide a few clues to this enigmatic film. Although I scratched my head at the ending, \\"Session 9\\" is a film every horror fan will want to watch. The filmmakers throw buckets of atmosphere at you, the soundtrack recalls the fractured, noisy music of \\"The Shining,\\" and there's even a bit of gore for the sauce lovers to savor. I would definitely watch Anderson's film again, and probably ought to since this type of film usually reveals more answers on subsequent viewings.

1400034779|5.0|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was, for me, a sublime and surprising pleasure.   <br /> <br />The characters are full of warmth and humour.  The Precious Ramotswe character, in particular, is a relevation.  The prose is simple yet effective and achingly beautiful; at times, the words almost leap off the page.  The vignettes, while perhaps at times a little too heavy on the morally instructive side, offer wonderful insights into the human condition.  And McCall Smith's passion for Africa, especially Botswana, shines through.   <br /> <br />I read the book in a couple of hours, yet it has stayed with me for days. <br /> <br />The best book I have read this year.

0385483821|5.0|Complacency is one of the biggest enemies of any organization, but especially for successful ones like Intel. ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE provides two powerful observations that will help anyone who reads this book: (1) That changes are lurking out there that need immediate attention inside your organization and (2) That you must be constantly vigilant for large discontinuous changes (such as those driven by microprocessors, Intel's main product). Having the perspective of someone who has been both the beneficiary and the target of discontinuous change, Dr. Grove's lessons become all the more real. At first, I thought this book was a little overdone; but upon reflection, I feel that complacency is probably best overcome by paranoia in the absence of the management process to locate, anticipate, create and adapt to externally-driven discontinuous changes. I often cite this book in our writings about how to be more successful, because I believe it is an important work. Please read this book, and take its lessons seriously. But have fun while you are being paranoid!
B00009RAJJ|4.0|This deluxe reissue of this disc has won FM a young new fan. You're listening to some truly inspired musicians, which the liner notes compare to the Beatles White Album with every right. This is four songwriters stretching out a bit and even competing in a sense to see who could come up with the best songs. Each songwriter brings something else to the table which added up to something greater than the sum of its parts.
B0002234LS|2.0|Borrowing liberally from The Shining and a bit from Misery, this watered down and tale is full of surprisingly bad dialogue-stuff which must have been taken directly from the Stephen King story on which it was based, for King often demonstrates an inability to write dialogue that doesn't feel written-and has one truly awful performance (Charles Dutton).  It's the kind of movie you figure out early and then you wait for the twist that is going to make it all up to you, but no such twist ever comes.  Most reviewers give kudos to Depp for his performance, but it seems an Emperor's New Clothing type accolade-there is nothing extraordinary about it.   It's not a tedious film, but it reminds one that King has grown increasingly irrelevant, his works are dated, that Koepp really isn't much of a director, and that good performers still take rolls in what they must know are going to be bad films.
6305781427|5.0|If you love music at all, you will find that all you invite to your living room to wathc this dvd will be entranced by the passion within minutes! Orchestras usually do little for me since they are the extension of one mans creativity, and seem so limited... however this orchestra is given liberty to extend the boundaries to afford individual creativity which flows into a beautiful flow of colors to make a sound which will carry you on a journey of sight and sound. The power of Yanni's passion bleeds over to the orchestra as he brings out the best in them. Its the power of mathmatics of exponential quantems of music! You would think that 2 musicians are twice as good as one?, however they are 4 times better!... when you see so many of the best of the best play together in one synergistic flow you will weep as you are moved by the passionate power of this music. And yes the audio only does so much, but the video brings it all to life. I can almost promise you, you will not be dissapointed! After seeing this, I can play the audio in my car and am often moved to tears, as a toy boat in the crashing waves of the surf is forced to be moved. <br />I too am a musician and I appreciate quality music, but quality alone is easy to find, its rare that you find people who will pour out thier life and let thier instrument become an extension of thier soul and thier essence. I give highest marks! <br />Yanni - A musicians musician!

B0000009SY|5.0|Frank Zappa is one of the most interesting and talented persons in the history of music. That people are still writing reviews of his music more than 10 years (and counting) after his death is only partial testament to that fact.<br /><br />Some of the rest of the proof lies in this album. Nowhere else in his recorded history, save perhaps for \\"Freak Out!\\" were Frank's warring perceptions of life more on display for all to hear.<br /><br />Zappa's dislike/disdain/contempt for all sorts of things are in ready supply in Joe's Garage, but unlike many of Frank's other works where deliberately offensive (depending on one's point of view) lyrics were surrounded by equally, er, peculiar music, there is a strong counterbalance of humanity interlaced; primarily through the sympathetic treatment of the doomed musician \\"Joe\\" in the musical  and lyrical compositions.<br /><br />Zappa was coming out of an exhausting legal battle with Warner Brothers in which he put out three intentionally uncommercial largely instrumental albums together to fulfill his contractual obligations (SD/ST/OF), and after taking some pointless swipes at cultural dislikes (in SYB), he was ready to articulate his real soul.<br /><br />That soul was, of course, all about music and freedom. Zappa rails with real passion lyrically and musically against repression; against religious, corporate and governmental control and censorship of any kind.<br /><br />So in between your titters or scowls at the various explicit scatological/sexual references; listen for the heart of Frank Zappa - Joe's Garage (love of music), Lucille (innocent love versus painful - no pun intended - realities), Sy Borg (love of technology, so to speak), Outside Now (anger, despair), Packard Goose (a shout-out to his fans, another poignant ode to music and a wicked stab at music \\"critics\\") and finally Watermelon in Easter Hay (resignation about the state of humanity -- one of the saddest and most beautiful songs ever laid to vinyl/digital).<br /><br />A last comment about this album - you are not likely elsewhere to hear any drumming quite like what you find on this album  - an impressive blend of composition, technology and technique. Zappa ALWAYS had great musicians playing with him, eager for the challenges that were provided for them by playing in his band...you are not likely elsewhere to hear any drumming quite like what you find on this album  - an impressive blend of composition, technology and technique.

0316168815|2.0|Like most other negative reviewers here, the main thing that drew me to The Lovely Bones was the hype. When one sees book-reviewing heavyweights like the New York Times giving a work of fiction unequivocal raves, you expect it to be good. Really, really good. Perhaps it was my elevated expectations of the novel that made it such a huge disappointment for me. Or the natural resentment any human would bear a book after hearing it called \\"a painfully fine literary accomplishment\\" 180 times. In any case, I found myself extremely bored, annoyed and frustrated after about the first 100 pages or so, having not formed any emotional investment in any of the characters whatsoever. <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones deals with a very gruesome and horrifying subject matter--(and I might add exploits this horrible subject matter shamelessly for pulling cheap emotional strings--but that's beside the point) the brutal rape and murder of a sweet fourteen-year old girl--which is enumerated in extremely graphic and sometimes nauseating detail in the first few pages (talk about a rude introduction). The premise is a rather interesting one--Susie, the murdered girl watches her family and friends deal with her death helplessly, and occasionally when she wants to enough is able to influence their actions. This could make for a wonderful novel--simple, compelling, sweet, hopeful. Sebold, however turns the story into something that is drab, depressing and absolutely unreadable after the first few chapters. Now, I understand that a novel which features a young girl being raped and cut into little pieces in the first chapter is not going to be all sunshine and kitties. But there is still just so much gloominess and depression one can take from one book. The outlook of The Lovely Bones from page 1 is not one of hope and tenderness, as the reviews promise but of death, depression and the sytematic and painful unravelling of a family. The last page leaves you just as gloomy and hopeless as you feltduring the rape scene.  <br /> <br />The bleak outlook aside, the other thing that made The Lovely Bones so unbearable were the characters. Susie, the narrator was likable enough and Mr. Salmon was heartbreaking and realistic as the desperate father, unwilling to let go but there were some serious kinks in all the other characterizations. Particularly Mrs. Salmon--her lack of response to the news of her daughter's death was suspicious but her affair with the detective investigating it was disgusting and gratuitous and her leaving her shattered family and her two young children behind was not only repulsive and unlikely but....weird... What mother alive would do something like that--leave her children (including a toddler son) and her husband, still reeling from the loss of his daughter to work in a winery in California? Buckley's response to her when she came back was utterly appropriate (Buckley at many points in the novel seemed like the only sane character). And finally, the oft-mentioned Ruth/Ray/Susie sex scene. All I could say after that scene was: Whaaat?!?! A murdered girl who mentally and emotionally is still fourteen years old is given the chance to return to Earth and instead of comforting her broken family or telling the police the identity of her murderer chooses to have sex with a junior high crush she barely knew--and while using another girl's body? What makes this even more bizarre is the fact that Susie's only sexual experience was an unthinkably brutal rape. Would she have recovered so fully that she could have rewarding, normal adult sex with a man? Also, the prevalence of relationships formed in early adolescence that last forever--what is up with that? How likely is it for a girl to marry and have the children of a boy she dated when she was 13? There are just too many parts of The Lovely Bones that don't add up or make any sense at all. <br /> <br />Polar Bear
B000020617|5.0|Opiniouns are different but personally this is the best rock album I own.

6300189821|5.0|\\"You are one...sick...puppy!\\" indeed. <br /> <br />A taut psychological thriller, \\"Mannequin\\" is a whirlwhind decent of one man further into his mind and into madness. Obsessed with Egyptian motifs, the man finds sexual release only in dry humping the piece of wood in his store only to spite James Spader. Brilliant. His conflicted sexuality manifests not only in the hallucinations of the alive mannequin, but also in his eccentric homosexual \\"friend,\\" Hollywood. It is this \\"Designing Women\\" star that really \\"brought the movie to life,\\" so to speak; the thoroughness of the main character's fake persona's coming to life couldn't be made more convincing. And the ironic denounment is filled with carefully planted clues by director Michael Gottlieb all to be answered in his \\"Mannequin 2.\\" <br /> <br />Though I do agree with one view who said, \\"This movie would be gooder with Michael J. Fox,\\" there isn't much any human being could create to thrilling climax on the mannequin-destroying-machine. I recommend this product with a proud five stars, even though I am personally holding off the for 20th anniversay DVD edition, if only so the director's commentary can finally answer the unanswered questions. I'm hoping that Andrew McCarthy discusses how to make such magic with a mannequin and how to keep things cool with a hot dame like Kim \\"I Had Sex With the Whole City\\" Cattrall as well. We too would never interrupt him when he's \\"getting a piece of wood,\\" as the irrepressible Hollywood put it. <br /> <br />Perhaps Sight and Sound shall lift its moratorium against \\"Mannequin\\" or \\"Mannequin 2\\" in next decade's top ten list.

What impresses me about this book is how many of the causes Scott Adams has identified. The man is clearly a great observer of organizations. His crusade against \\"stalled\\" thinking (especially by the leaders) also means that others with keen insights send him their observations, as well. Future historians of the American corporation would do better to start with Scott Adams than most of the organizational theory and practice business books that have been written. His humor is excellent, because he is unerring in picking the right balloon to pop. As a management consultant, I regularly reread his chapter on management consultants to be sure that I am not behaving like the ones he describes. Keep these wonderful books and comic strips coming! Be sure to post the strips where they will get the most attention. Maybe you will help someone wake up in your leadership!

B000026FOA|5.0|Nick Drake is probably the most fragile, genuine musician I have ever heard. Even if you didn't know about the unfortunate details of his life (and death), his music more than tells the story. It can be said that his music was beautiful, original, melodic, and classic, but I think that the most remarkable thing about it is the depth of personal, childlike emotion he filled it with. Nick Drake's voice had an uncanny ability to translate directly from his mood to your ears. At the risk of being voted down, I'll say that his music is not for everyone. Indeed, it's probably not for the majority of people. His songs were crafted with a minimum of force and flair, and don't grab your attention if you're not listening. They're muted, floating, subtle compositions that don't play well in a public setting. They're also progressively depressing, with Pink Moon as the capstone on a lonely life. Because of this, I find it hard to listen to his music today. I found Nick Drake when I was at a very similar place in life, and the music sounded as if it were a soundtrack to my experience. It was one of the few things I had that I could relate to, and it gave me a friend to commiserate with. Because of this, it frightens me to encounter again, having climbed out of that hole. Music is the truest expression of emotion, to me, and as such it has the ability to tune you to its frequency. <br />Still, you listen for what you feel, and Nick's songs weren't all sombre and lost. Five Leaves Left strikes me as his most upbeat, accessible albumn, and features several of his best songs, appropriate for any mood. Will you like his music? Give it a go.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie has made the story of the Lord real.  After watching this movie, reading the Passion text in the Gospels will give you a new experience.  You will know what suffering really is and how much the Lord loves us.  The movie also depicts how much our Lady suffered seeing her son being constantly beaten.  As she was told by Simeon, truely a sword pierced her heart as looked up his mutilated body.  The violence of the film is necessary to express the true nature of divine love, for many still fall short of understanding it.  The Lord's wounds are meant to heal us, not scare us.  The movie also showed how brutal the Romans were.  As an Italian, I am now ashamed to be a descendant of theirs.  Women are portrayed beautifully in this film, as gentle, kind, mercyfull and loving.  The men are portrayed as arrogant and cowards.  St. Luke would be pleased.  As for the Jews, showing two chief priests protest the trial (not in scripture), showing Simon defend Jesus against the Romans (not in scripture), showing the dozens of weaping Jewish women, showing Jesus clearly state that he freely chooses to sacrafise his life and that no other can take it way, and finally choosing a Jew to play Mary all convince me that this movie is free of anti-semitism.  Showing the devil in agony at the end and beautifully portrayed resurrection scene gets the point across that good defeated evil for our own sake.  Now I wish Mel would make another depicting the rise of Christianity, especially showing the passion of the martyrs and how Christendom finally defeated paganism.
0393035158|5.0|Joseph Conrad wrote something like this, \\"The highest service of art is in its support of reality\\". The idea that art should strive to reveal Nature to humanity has always struck me as ennobling. By far the greatest employment of the human creative effort is in the support, not of Nature, but of religious paraphernalia and sacred architectures. Theology is not in the service of Nature. All people are aware that there are no real gods; all mysteries are created by imagination. Perhaps Conrad would have thought of religion as a lower purpose for art, and like all lower purposes, should be practiced solely for its entertainment value. There should be no intellectual harm in imagining gods of any sorts. Thinking that gods somehow depict a part of real, observable Nature, naturally, would be wrong. Sam Harris's `The End Of Faith' draws a line in the sand. Over that line, he cannot expect one hundred and seventy nine out of one hundred and eighty, to step. But he is hopeful that that at least a few more than one, out of the hundred and eighty, will cross over. This is the Alamo, in reverse proportions, but the stakes are even higher. <br /> <br />Those who have grieved the dimming of the Enlightenment are being called upon to protest the loss of intellectual light. Similar to what John Adams done many years before, contemporary Americans are being asked to contemplate the ruinous affect that theology will impress on the world's first real democracy. Young Brights (checkout this word on the Internet) are being challenged to step over the line and challenge this monster of the single-studied-story. France, that country with a failed Revolution in its past, currently leads western society towards greater secularism and rationality. The United States, this country that experienced a spectacularly successful revolution, is currently leading western society towards greater religiosity and mysticism. What is going wrong? If you can't make a stand, and step over this line, at least read this book! <br />
0743243307|2.0|As I curled up in bed with Brick Lane in hand, I prepared myself for a tale of what I thought would be a conflict between love, morality, and responsibility. I was expecting a battle between races, a story of desires, independence, and subordination. What I discovered in the novel was a more weakened version of those themes than what I had hoped for.  <br />When the story began I was intrigued with the idea of fate and destiny. Since Nazneen's survival of a seemingly terminal illness at birth was deemed the result of fate, would a lifetime of marriage to a churlish and repulsive man be similarly ascribed? Or would the destiny that had saved her in the beginning also rescue her from her somewhat oppressive husband? I initially felt a strong connection to Nazneen; I hoped that fate would take her away from the husband she so loathed. However, this passionate desire for independence that I shared with Nazneen, slowly deteriorated as the uneventful and sluggish plot unfolded. The development of Chanu was inadequate. Vivid portrayals of his physique, with corns and a flabby body, convinced me of his repulsiveness. Yet I never believed him to be domineering enough. He never hurt Nazneen and she was never truly bound to spend boring days in their flat. On the days when she would break away from her dreary routine, Chanu never knew and never cared. Rather than hoping for and anticipating Nazneen's escape from her \\"imprisonment,\\" I found myself searching for ways to abhor Chanu, which I was never fully able to do. And because I never came to detest Chanu, I could not sympathize with Nazneen.  <br />I think in order for Brick Lane to have been a more pleasurable and meaningful novel, each part of the story needs to be made stronger, more jarring, and more present. Chanu should have been developed beyond a man solely focused on himself and his studies; he should have been cold and cruel. Hasina should have been more than a few unintelligible letters placed annoyingly throughout the book and Karim and the Bengal Tigers should have been more than some delivered pamphlets with seemingly random messages. I think the book was filled with wonderful and captivating ideas. However, while alluring on the outset, it left me hungry for any real substance.  <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I agree with the reviewers who are tired of the whining \\"I miss the original Star Wars\\".  C'mon, it is still the ultimate, regardless of what George Lucas has done. You know what, it's his movies.  Let him do whatever he wants with them. If you think you can do better, make your own movie. Do you still wear a mullet? Or do you change your hairstyle to match what's popular now? Are you still wearing your bellbottoms and high platform boots? Is gas still 80 cents a gallon? Give me a break.  <br />The updated Star Wars can be a little overzealous with some of the inclusions. I don't like the Greedo scene, or Han walking over Jabba's tail.  But it's George's films.  Respect him for even making the movies in the first place. You wouldn't even be complaining if he didn't do them in the first place. <br /> I just wished that he had included the scenes with Biggs and Luke before Biggs left Tatooine to join the Rebels, and the scene where Luke looks up to see the battle between Princess Leah's ship and the Star Destroyer.  Trust me, there are a lot of omitted scenes.  Would you whine if they were included?
B00007GZR5|4.0|Despite what other people are saying, I thought this was a wonderful movie. A touching story filled with drama, despair and hope. A not-so-new idea of what heaven and hell could be is transformed into a unique vision with the aid of astonishing visual effects.  The movie could have been a bit better with a slightly different cast, most noticeably either another actress as Robin William's great love Annie, or Robin himself replaced by someone else. Acting isn't quite Oscar-worthy but convincing enough.  All in all, like I said, I personally found this movie wonderful. It's one of the few titles I own that I go back every now and then and watch it again.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Joan Crawford is the greatest. Combine her talents with a great script, Michael Curtiz, and a nice supporting cast - magic is born. This is one of those movies that will never be outdated - and will continue to influence countless film-makers. I think it is Michael Curtiz' best film - including 'Casablanca'.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Christian Bale, the main character in the movie Equilibrium should have definitely been Neo in the Matrix trilogy.  Equilibrium's premise is almost the same as Orwell's book called 1984.  In a future world, emotion and anything that might trigger any kind of emotion is outlawed and destroyed. Art is burned. People that are caught having any sort of feelings are instantly sentenced to death. The masses are being brainwashed, being taught that feeling is the mother of chaos, of suffering, of war and destruction.  Action scenes? Forget the Matrix! Cleric's moves will leave you dumbstruck.  Great movie, great plot, great action. I recommend it to everyone.
1559408855|5.0|There will never be another film like Salo - the very fact that it was produced is a miracle and one we should be very greatful for.<br /><br />Pasolini, I believe, has here one of the best visions of the possibilities of the cinema. He is not, as Leonard Maltin says, out for pure sensationalism and contreversy. No, there is something more calculated about this film.<br /><br />What this movie made clear to me - is that in this world we are all responsible. In the final scenes of the movie - Pasolini's hints at voyeurism suggest something parallel to you the viewer of the film. Yes, you are watching.. You are seeing the atrocities of the world - and you are no better than anyone else.<br /><br />As images from Iraq emerge - like mistreatment of iraqui prisoners, beheading of American soldiers, greed over oil - we should reflect on 'Salo' - yes we are responsible - lets do something about it.
0792833279|5.0|This is one of the few movies I own that I can watch again and again. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites. <br />Get Shorty is smart and funny.

0805211063|5.0|Kafka's book is way ahead of its time. I feel that it is as relevant today as it was when it was written. We are all like little ants in a beaurocratic world, paddling against the current.<br /><br />I also kind of like the fact that the book is incomplete - it reflects the fact that the situation that this mirrors in society is also incomplete and has not been addressed.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris has written a clear, well documented, assessment of the effect of faith, as represented by various religions, on the relationships of God fearing peoples.  Although man's search for land, gold and oil over the centuries has not been blended into Harris' analysis of the effects of differing beliefs in how to worship an unknown, unmeasureable \\"God\\", he clearly demonstrates the divisiveness of religion on mankind.  From matters as seemingly simple as separation of church and state to the complex issues of ethics and morals, Harris leads us to his central theme, i.e., that faith as expressed in conflicting religions may well bring civilzation to an end.  Comparing the present Muslim world to the Inquisition, Harris demonstrates the danger of trying to deal rationally with an irrational religious society.  Supported by lengthy footnotes and parallel discussions, fortunately relegated to the back of the book to assure easy reading, religious issues and events over the centuries are shown to be the cause of continued social and political conflict throughout the world.   <br /> <br />For an atheist, this book sums it all up and belongs on the shelf next to the writings of Bertrand Russell.  The faithful who read this book will probably reject it based on \\"faith\\".  Finally, Harris amusingly suggests an exercise.  Every time you hear a politician or scholar invoking \\"God\\" in his speech, just substitute \\"Zeus\\" or \\"Apollo\\" and see how much sense that makes to you!

0790731452|1.0|I can NOT in good conscience give this movie anything but ONE-HALF a star!!.<br />This is one of THE worst movies ever made.This so-called \\"send up\\" on Sc-Fi movies of the 50s fails on all counts.<br />It is a most UNFUNNY movie.<br />It is filled with an allstar cast that has virtually no where to go with a convoluted and terribly lame script.<br />It's important to note that Director Burton wanted not only to do a\\"send up\\" but also pay homage to the Sci-Fi genre.When the movie is not pathetically and desperately trying to be\\" funny\\", it is pathetically and desperately trying to be \\" serious\\".It no more succeeds in one than in the other.<br />The movie just doesn't know what it wants to be or do.<br />Burton trys to make the aliens/picture funny and might have succeeded had the aliens remained in the awkward and/or bumbling category but when they visciously attack (and in graphic detail !)  the concept becomes derailed immediately.This sends we the viewer into an intellectual quandry.We start looking for the \\"hook\\" or the\\"bridge\\" in the plot.What device is being used here to convince us that this picture can/will be serious but at any moment become a parody/funny?The answer?......nothing.It tried to do two quite disjointed things and totally failed all around.<br />Not a movie to recommed in any way,shape or form.<br />Please note:<br />Clothes pins are unfortunately NOT included with this DVD!

B00005NP04|5.0|This CD is an awesome CD and a great one for women. It is has a song for everything. Martina's voice is awesome and I could listen to it for hours. Each song on this CD promotes how women have power and also independance. My Baby Loves Me talks about how a women does not have to change herself for her man, he loves her just they way she is. One of the songs on the CD that has created controversy is Independance Day. This song talks about domestic violence and createded a lot of drama in the country music industry but it is a great and powerful song. All of the songs on this CD will leave a lasting impression on anyone who listens to this CD
B000268QB2|5.0|Though many reviewers on this site have labelled Keane a \\"rip-off,\\" I don't think that is true.  Do they sound like Travis or Coldplay, in some ways, sure.  But should that invalidate a trully great album by three very talented musicians? Absolutely NOT. I like Travis, and I like Coldplay, but to me, that is irrelevant.<br /><br />These guys are the real thing, and they have the chops to back up the sound live, unlike many studio-dependent bands these days.  I dare you to find another vocalist who can match the range and strength of Tom Chaplin--not only can he hit the notes, but he can hold them too.  The other two members of the band, Tim Rice-Oxley and Richard Hughes, are equally gifted. . .<br /><br />So if you want to hear some great tunes, but give these guys a try.  Stand-outs on the album for me include \\"Bend and Break\\" and \\"Bed-Shaped,\\" but of course, the radio singles (\\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"This Is the Last Time\\" are terrific too.<br /><br />Even better, if you have the chance, go see them live.  In England, you can't get a ticket, but in the US, they're still playing relatively small venues.  Don't think about it, just go.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have just spent an entire Star Wars Sunday watching the DVD Set for the first time. I have to say as a fan since the age of seven since the original films release in '77 that the films have never looked better. I approve of all the changes except for the one that is getting the most buzz from all fans old and new. <br /> <br />A NEW HOPE: <br />I am happy that, here goes the first spolier, Jabba was changed again for Episode IV: A New Hope. The first time we see him in '97 for the Special Edition he appeared smaller, which was okay because he was younger. Yet when he appeared in Episode I: The Phantom Menace he was as big as he was in Return Of The Jedi. That was obviously a continuity error that has now been corrected. And thankfully so. <br /> <br />THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK <br />I am also pleased that The Emperor is now portrayed by Ian McDiarmid. He is The Emperor that we have come to know in Return Of The Jedi and the three Prequels. Which again adds continuity in the Star Wars universe. <br /> <br />When I first heard the voice of Boba Fett I noticed a change right away. His voice is now supplied by the same actor who portrayed Fett's father Jango in Episode II: Attack Of The Clones. This makes sense because Boba is Jango's clone and should have the same voice. Once again continuity comes into play. <br /> <br />RETURN OF THE JEDI: <br />Now we get to the scene that is getting all of the buzz. The end of the film where we see the spirits of Kenobi, Yoda and Annakin <br />has been altered. The actor Sebastian Shore who portrayed Annakin in Jedi when the Vader's mask is removed and as a spirit, as stated above, has been replaced by Hayden Christiansen from Episodes II and III in the Spirit scene. <br /> <br />I can see Lucas' reasoning for the change, again for continuity, but why not show a young Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) or young Yoda (Episode I era)???? The change would make more sense and be a lot more effective. Why just Annakin? To show the character beforehis fall from grace as a Jedi? This would be acceptable I suppose. But in all honesty I think this scene should have been left the way it was shot originally. <br /> <br />Overall a lovely addition to my collection. The extra disc contains a fantastic documentary of all three films and a 10 minute sneak peak of Episode III where we get to see Annakin don the Vader suit for the 1st time and tons more. We've all waited long enough for this set. I too would have preferred the original theatrical releases but after seing how beautiful the sound and picture is I'm sure we'll all grow accustomed to the changes.

0671891634|5.0|This is one of the \\"must read\\" books for anyone wanting to invest well, and gets 5 stars for that reason only.  It is by and about Lynch and his legendary carreer @ Fidelity's Magellan Fund, and the period Lynch knocked the cover off the ball hitting home run after home run for a long string of years.  <br />  <br />How did he do it?  Well, several other reviews point out the difficulty of extracting Lynch's secret formula, and they rightly describe the lack of formulaic presentation.  If there was a fabulous book on Lynch instead of this autobiographical one, I might put it on the \\"must read\\" list instead.  There is not (yet, maybe Lowenstein will grace us with one?).  However, too many fail in investing by looking for instant-coffee recipies that any boob can implement from the couch.  If it was that simple, everyone would be rich.  Success takes work and in-depth understanding of some, probably simple, strategies that ordinary investors can learn.  In fact, investors who focus on fundamentals of the sort described by Lynch, & stay tuned out of the frenetic trading centers' \\"action,\\" are likely to increase chances of success.  The real beauty of Lynch's book is the myriad of different strategies, one or a few of which each of us can learn and implement as our investing \\"sweet spot.\\" <br /> <br />Lynch covers a series of investment decisions in some detail.  The detail is not uniform from company to company, position to position, making comparison of his formula difficult between investments.  And he does not summarize his formula anywhere in the book.  This oversight (which may be intentional to more quickly drop the instant-coffee addicts) leaves it up to the reader to digest the material and extract the essential focus of the master.  I suggest a relaxed, 3 part method to do the extraction: <br />1) read the whole book (its easy reading), then set it down for a week or so. <br />2) read it a second time, pencil or highlighter in hand, and mark where you spot formulaic focus you can implement. <br />3) read it again in 6 months or a year, and repeat #2.  This time around, with the aging of the first 2 readings, you will be surprised at how the formulae stand out.  You will \\"see\\" more of what Lynch describes, and take your understanding of the master's strategic vision to a new and satisfying level.  Not all examples will give the same level of insight to the master's strategies, so don't strain to make Lynch's magic stand out on every page.  It is really only about what you can see & replicate.  Even one good trick, well understood, will be worth the effort for your invesment results.  If you can find 2 or 3 good tricks, like I did, you are on your way to richer success. <br /> <br />I have read this book at least 5 times (so far), and I get a firmer understanding of Lynch's myriad strategies each time.  As a master of the game, and with a mountainous pile of cash demanding a high yield, Lynch needed many strategies to keep out-distancing all the averages.  He did just that.  Although a cookbook would be easier to put into use, it probably wouldn't work as well, as it wouldn't require depth of understanding.  Patience is the key to implementing this important work. <br /> <br />Beating the Street stands among others on the \\"must-read\\" list: <br />~ The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham (ignore the mathematical formula, but savor the stuff on perspective & margin of safety; another book that should be re-read periodically), <br />~ Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, Phil Fisher (ditto on the re-reading), <br />~ Conservative Investors Sleep Well, also by Fisher; out of print so watch here on Amazon for a clean used copy, <br />~ Buffett, the Making of an American Capitalist, Roger Lowenstein <br />~ The essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America, Buffett & Cunningham (great compendium of Buffett's own analysis of corporate governance, accounting and other issues investors need to watch), <br />~ When GeniusFailed, the Rise & Fall of Long Term Capital Management, Roger Lowenstein.  This is the sort of post-mortem on investing mistakes that every investor needs to guard against, and all the more important because it was a cadre of smart guys who lost their butts, <br />~ academic papers of Terrance Odean & Brad Barber, finance professors @ UC Berkeley & UC Davis, respectively, see their websites for links to papers about investor mistakes to avoid. <br />Good Luck on the Street!

Go see the movie, better yet, BUY the movie and invite EVERYONE over to watch it, PRIOR to the elections!!!
0671027387|2.0|As The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, Deception Point is a fascinating story.  Action packed and thrilling, I felt I could not put it down until I was done reading, but then came the disappointment.  As his previous two books, boy and girl now have to save the U.S. presidencial office, all in one day, in one far-fetched adventure after another. Characters that survive getting lost in the North Pole and fall into Arctic waters, but suffer no frost bite and only mild shock, fly for hours in one day, swim with sharks and survive bullet wounds, etc., and still have the energy to have breakfast at the White House, well....  Unlike his other two books, this one does not leave you with a sense of having read an educated novel, instead, you feel you really enjoyed wasting your time.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Look, I don't believe everything in this film, but I enjoyed it so much I saw it twice in the theaters, and I even convinced my conservative sister and mom to see it.  Did it change their vote?  No, but they're glad they went.  It's NOT propaganda, as often claimed -- it's a visual op-ed piece.  It's Moore's opinion.  And it's intriguing enough to warrent a viewing by even the most skeptical:  And, after all, you can't really criticize it with any authority if you haven't seen the film, can you?
B00005YU1O|5.0|this movie really expanded my perception as to the real potential of the human mind.  Very interesting movie.
B00003CXBH|5.0|If you have a knowledge of the history behind \\"The Mission\\" you will have a greater appreciation for the film and what it is portraying.  The story line depicts the power struggle between Spain and Portugal which resulted in the line of demarcation in South America.  It portrays how Indian villages were put into slavery as a result of human greed.  It demonstrates the natives and missionaries attempts to resist slavery and destruction of their villages.  While some used passive resistance and a reliance on faith, others used force.  Neither method saved them from the slave traders. Evil prevailed.  Ironically, had the Indians not embraced \\"the faith\\" they may have been able to fight off the slave traders. <br />   The film portrays the struggles that jesuit missionaries endured to foster the faith that ultimately let them down.  Here we see the sinister side of the papal chosen-ones.     The human element of the Catholic Church and lust for power are clearly portrayed in this film and contribute to the drama, which makes \\"The Mission\\" so compelling and thought-provoking.   <br />   This film has some scenes which are a bit far fetched, as others have said, however the cinemaphotography is outstanding.  The cinemaphotography, alone, is reason to see the film. <br />   I rarely purchase DVD's, but this one deserved to be on my shelf.    <br />   If you like this film, \\"Blackrobe\\" is another very realistic film about Jesuit missionaries who worked with North American Native Americans.
6305609705|5.0|This is a top notch, classic war movie that captures the duality and extremes of human nature unlike any other. I won't waste my time or yours writing a lengthy description on the plot, actors, or directing style of the movie...bottom line is, if you don't own this movie or have not seen it, go get it. This one ranks up in my top 5 all time favorites. Few know that this movie is actually based on the \\"Heart of Darkness\\", a novel by Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br />The redux version contains extra footage that long time Apocalypse fans should appreciate, but it can confuse the core story line and drag the movie out for those seeing it for the first time. A must have for any war movie or Francis Ford Coppola fan.

0394720288|3.0|As always, simple minded Bertie is in the soup. He has gotten on the wrong side of Sir Watkyn Bassett and his close pal Spode for trying to grab a silverware for his Uncle Tom, which Bassett had an eye on. Aunt Dahlia (Tom's wife) sends him to Totleigh Towers to steal it. Also, at Totleigh Towers, Bertie's pal Gussie is preparing to get married to Madeline (Watkyn's daughter). Meanwhile, Stiffy (Watkyn's nice) is in love with Pinker (another pal of Bertie). When Bertie arrives at Totleigh Towers, everything that can go wrong with the lives of these people, breaks loose. And all of them are aimed at Bertie! Bertie faces all of it with the help of his faithful butler Jeeves and all ends well.<br /><br />If there were no sitcom on TV, Wodehouse would have invented it. The outlandish characters, the outrageous dialogues, all set in rich classic Britain. I couldn't help laughing out loud while reading this book. Between all these stormy characters is the real hero of the books -- Jeeves with his cucumber cool air. Wodehouse cannot be explained, has to be read. I see a definite movie potential in his books.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, The Code Of The Woosters is \\"Never let a pal down.
B00000I2PG|5.0|What can be said about this album that hasn't been said already? It is PHENOMENAL!  <br />I am late to the party...I just purchased this album due in part to seeing ABC on the show Bands Reunited on VH1. I must say, I wasn't expecting very much, because I barely remembered ABC (a little too young) but..this album is AMAZING! <br /> <br />Standout tracks (as mentioned in previous, great posts above) Look of Love, Poison Arrow, and my personal FAVORITE Date Stamp (which has an amazing banter between a female singer, and Martin Fry)  <br />Another great track (to me) is Tears Are Not Enough, it is groovy and funky, and everything nice :) <br /> <br />If you like such bands like Duran Duran (which is my fave band)  <br />or Bryan Ferry (of Roxy Music) or any new wave at all, you NEED this album, it is really really great!!!
B0002S94OS|5.0|Talk about an eye opener. Lamb of God originally from Richmond Virginia has wow'd me once again! I was partial to As the Palaces Burn just due to the message it sent out. But now, with Ashes of the Wake this is pure, driving, chaotic metal. This is what you Mosh to, this is what you release anger with. This is the premiere Metal album of the year. Pure unrelenting focused anger. The vocalist has one of the most distinct voices in the business and Lamb of God is ready to explode!
0393035158|5.0|This is the most important book to be released since the turn of the century.  That may sound embellished, but if you read The End of Faith you'll likely agree that Harris's book is the most thorough, provoking and frank look at religion and faith vis-a-vis science and reason in recent history.  Look elsewhere if you want to read more of the same safe, politically correct texts by religion's apologists;  for a concise, well written, and truthful look at the battle of the next hundred years, read The End of Faith.  I couldn't recommend this book more.
B00000337U|5.0|Throb was my introduction to jazz back in '69 or '70.  I have <br />listened to it all of these years on LP then CD, and it never <br />lost its charm.  Steve Swallow was just as nutty then as he is now, \\"Chickens\\" <br /> is my favorite cut.  The play between electric <br />violinist Richard Greene and guitarist Jerry Hahn is a thing of <br />beauty. Hahn is still a player who can put just the right note <br />in just the right place (like that other countrified genius of <br />jazz Bill Frisell), he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle the <br />strings just right to make his musical point.  One interesting <br />thing is the organ playing by Burton on Throb, besides his vibes. <br /> The Jarrett-Burton album also has Hahn and Swallow, and drummer <br />Bill Goodwin --It is very much an album that shows all the new <br />ideas sprouting in music.  Fortunately, the ideas of that time <br />did not die out, but have continued to grow, making room for all <br />sorts of fusions in Jazz, many of which have been remarkable to <br />experience. These two-LPs-in-one is like having a Superstar <br />album before they became superstars.  As I said before, I <br />still play this CD after almost 35 years, and I still get a kick <br />out of it, and still find things that amaze me.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|For all people we have played all the Resident Evils games maybe this movie looks a little bad in some aspects but we muts remeber its only a movie and not a videogame,the movie for my is god and the efcts are not so bad,and if you never buy the dvd of this movie its time right now,because there a lot of extras and previews of Residen Evil 2 movie whit subtitles in spanish and other latinoamerican languages. <br /> <br />Espaol : Para todas quellas personas que hemos jugado los juegos de resident evil talves esta pelicula no nos agrade del todo ,pero debemos recordar que no es el videojuego sino solo una pelicula,los efectos son buenso y los extras que traen deben ser buenos tambien,si no has comprado la pelicula esta es una buena opcion para hacerlo ya que contiene subtitulos en espaol y otras lenguas latinoamericanas.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin fans all around praised Vol. 1 religously... but Vol. 2 gets the cold shoulder. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, they hated the dialogue. Many people wanted the action and cartoony violence of the first installment. Some heard Vol. 2 was supposed to be bloodier (which I did read in a special issue of Maxim Goes to the Movies), but... we get dialogue. But in return, we get a much more developed story. Volume 1 rushed through the character development and storyline, and now Volume 2 makes up for that, delivering the classic Tarantino formula: The witty and intelligent dialogue.  <br /> <br />So... Tarantino is best known for his dialogue. So why are fans loathing this movie? Doesn't Tarantino do what he's best at? Doesn't he deliver the same formula he's given to us since his first movie \\"Reservoir Dogs\\"? And I read that some of the negative reviews were posted by \\"big fans of Quentin.\\" So let me get something straight here. Those \\"fans\\" hate this movie because of the excessive dialogue, but, considering that they are indeed fans of Tarantino's movies, then they must really love the underrated Tarantino classic \\"Jackie Brown.\\" That movie, my friend, is nearly devoid of any action sequences. Rarely any shoot-em up scenes (the big money exchange sequence may be counted as an action scene as well). That movie has nothing but dialogue... so why bash this movie that has relatively more action scenes than \\"Jackie Brown\\"? If you don't appreciate Vol. 2, then can you honestly say you're a big Tarantino fan?  <br /> <br />Well... that being said, Vol. 2 is another great addition for the Tarantino addict. Adds more background to the characters and storyline that was mostly left out in the first film. I won't say what the movie is about since mostly everybody else here already has. You just have to watch it for yourself.  <br /> <br />Both movies are works of art. Neither is better than the other. After all, it's just ONE movie.  <br /> <br />Lastly, I read that while Vol.1 was an homage to martial arts movies, Vol. 2 was an homage to \\"Spagetti-Westerns.\\"  <br /> <br />Now sit back and enjoy the masterpiece that is \\"Kill Bill.\\"
B0000TLA9G|4.0|All in all a really good cd,and I was surprised to find \\"since I dont have you\\"and \\"sympathy for the devil\\" <br />on there!...My complaint is that they only included 3 songs from appetite for destruction.The whole entire album is excellent and needs at least 5 or 6 songs from appetite.My recommendation would be to add rocket queen along with either ...mr.brownstone,it's so easy,my michelle,or night train.Also off gnr lies one in a million or used to love her would be good too.Take off aint it fun and yesterdays because they are kinda dull. <br />
0743243315|4.0|Its not a bad read, better than some of the other asian-culture books I have read.  The book is about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi, who is at 18 years married off to a UK-based Bangladeshi, some 20 years her senior.  The book revolves arounf her life in the East End of London, and her silent struggles.  I felt that the book was like a great looking sandwich, with fresh bread, however, the filling was a little soggy! In other words, the beginning and ending are captivating, but the middle was a little slow.  I would have liked to have read more about Nazneens relationship with Karim.  The letters from her sister slowed the whole reading experience down a bit - and I could have done without this.
B000093OUA|5.0|Gary Moore's first foray into the blues is still as relevant as ever.  If you love his hard rock work, then you won't be disappointed by this work.  The title track STILL GOT THE BLUES is a classic track... in my opinion, it stands up there with Hotel California, Free Bird, and Stairway to Heaven.  Gary plays with feeling, conviction, and authority... he's simply as good as it gets.  This \\"blues\\" collection is definitely bluesy, but it's got a really aggressive edge... more rocking than most blues.  His tone is incredible, and it seeps with feeling.  STILL GOT THE BLUES is a must have.
