0783227434|5.0|There ren't many cult-type classics that deserved the title 'classic' but there is no doubt that this one deserves every accolade its gotten! Alongside great ones like Big Trouble in Little China, Rocky Horror Picture Show, or Monty Python and the Holy Grail, this movie is one of the funniest and most enjoyable films made. Whether you've seen the preceding films or not you will still find yourself watching this one over and over again. Bruce Campbell is so underrated. His portrayal of the hero ASH is classic. From the beginning of the movie to the end you won't be able to turn away from this creative story of boy gets girl, boy loses girl to evil demonic entity, boy gets sent back in time to a mideval land where evil attempts to conquer and enslave everyone,boy gets another girl, girl gets possessed, boy --- ah  find out for yourself! Well worth the money.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- watch this movie. If you're into cult classics you'll agree.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Very impressive casting for this performance and recording.  Price of DVD was very reasonable and quality was excellent.  Would purchase other DVD's of this quality.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This movie is hands down a new favorite in our house. The characters and the story are fantastic! Danny Devito is a great director. Splendidly good family time :)
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Have listened to the album a few times through now and I love it! Darius is a great artist and it really shows how much he has come into his own realm of country. Doesn't hurt that my son loves Wagon Wheel and dances every time it comes on!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Ceonceptually this book is different from the start. That the world is filled with new and old gods is quite interesting.<br /><br />The writing is on another level, however, the author says many things that are important and challenging to traditional thinking,
159463176X|4.0|This book is quite expansive in every sense of the word.  Traveling both emotionally and geographically through the interweaving of family dynamics, culture, character, passion, loss, love, disappointment, illness, grief, duty, burden, escape and possibility, this book captures every human emotion and character trait perfectly.  My criticism is that it is too expansive for my taste.  It is like a thousand piece puzzle that comes together in parts and reveals its form in parts, but remains largely unsolved.  I am left frustrated and wanting.  It was intended to be this way I suppose.  There were chapters that were completely irrelevant to the main story - the one that captures your curiosity and breaks your heart from the second chapter.  They were unnecessary diversions and I would have much more preferred to wallow in misery for a bit longer - watching the drama and heart wrenching loneliness and grief for several more chapters - than be led down a thousand different rivers, with only one leading to the ocean.  For those looking to be inspired and encouraged about life and all of its possibility, this book will leave you longing.  Unlike A Thousand Splendid Suns, the happy ending in this book is realistically basic and simple.  It is not romantic or contrived (the way I like it).  Yet, no one explains the inner workings of the human psyche better than Khaled Hosseini.  He is masterfully perceptive and manages to make every person walking this earth one of his characters in some way.  He is the people's writer.  In that way, it is impossible to dislike this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining. You get drawn in to the characters. Can't wait for the next season. Worth the time watching in the evening.
B006Z2WE0G|4.0|I liked this book as it is based on a little known but important part of history.  Many layers to this story.  Well written.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you love science fiction and unexplainable events, this is your show. Watch the pilot and you will be hooked.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have bought countless books in the &#34;swim lane&#34; and even more edgy (read: more explicit) ---- already I love this book...funny, different from guy's POV and the ultimate rom/com in a book! Buy it NOW - enough said!
B00CW665VI|3.0|I did't find the book \\"hilarious\\", or engrossing. The frame-freezing got on my nerves, just some very light chick-lit, easily forgetable. I just got bored reading it and definitely don't understand the 5* reviews.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I like apps that allow you to. earn points. quickly and not have pay for every new item that you need to continue. to the next level.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me laughing outloud from page one and all the way through to the end!  This story is written from Drew's point of view and that right there is a refreshing change from the mainstream romantic ficiton.  His thoughts and narration give a whole new meaning to \\"what is that guy thinking?\\"  Kate is exactly what he needs and it is so much fun to see the sparks fly and the battle fought.  Tangled was a fun, light, romantic comedy that I just loved and couldn't get enough of.  If you buy this book you will definatley not be disappointed!
B00CBRADU2|1.0|this movie was pretty dreadful I almost didn't finish it about 4 times , the last bit with Arnold and some action was the normal Arnold variety but the screenplay was just so horrible.  it seemed to be just a bunch of clips trying to tie into a movie, which is fine for a real action movie but this was barely an action movie the action was just stupid u spent half the action wondering why is everyone doing what there doing. It was very disappointing for an Arnold film, but then maybe it was just a political advertisement who knows.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I really wanted to like this show, but it fell a little flat! I've heard so many great things, I think I'm going to keep watching- there's got to be a reason it's so popular, right?
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I was not familiar with this game before, but I like it. I is fun and challenging while not being too complicated.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all diary of a wimpy kid!!! It's funny,entertaining and totally cool!! So do my friends. We read it all together sometimes!!
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie is the best! My uncle said this was his favorite album and now I see why. Classic music from a classic artist.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game hands down. Very thought provoking. Will keep you busy for hours on end. Well worth buying. Well done.
0399226907|5.0|Ordered this book because I had it as a child. My 13 month old hasn't put it down since I read it to him, as soon as I got it in. So cute, he loves it!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It was the best game I've ever played. If you are a good fan of the computer version then you'll be a fan of this game too because it is a exact replica of BTD 5 and I've really enjoyed playing this game.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I really enjoyed the way King setup this story. The way the terror builds up is brilliant. One of the best horror books ever written
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This season really gets to the action and the characters we've all been waiting for - the dragons.  I can't wait for season three to see how the dragons play out their roles.  Oh yes, and there are even pirates this season, which was very unexpected, and they weren't potrayed in the usual way, which was refreshing.  Love the character development in this show, and I'm always suprised by who comes out on top.<br /><br />The show could use a bit less female nudity and more beasts and magic, but I have a feeling that's coming.
1439152802|5.0|A very good read!  I hated to finish the book!  I have recommended Morton to all of my reader friends!
0545265355|5.0|MY DUGHTER IS READIN IT AT THIS MOMENT AND SHE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO BE SHOEN AT THE THEATER TO GO SEE IT IN PUERTO RICO IN NOVEMBER.
0380778556|1.0|I loved the screen version of Rebecca.  The paperback version of this book was of such a poor quality I threw it away.  I have never thrown a book away!
B001ANSS5K|2.0|Not one of my favorites, but I got through it.  Much of it seemed to imply psychological trauma beneath the surface and we can find enough of that in the real world.  I read for pleasure and knowledge - this didn't seem to offer either to me.  Others may enjoy the ride.
0330449605|5.0|I have now read all of Kate Mortons books.  I loved each one!  I strongly recommend all of Morton's books!
B000QCS8TW|2.0|Much like Michael Crichton, this gut has great ideas, but he is a mediocre writer at best. At best. If he was a better writer it would not be such a struggle. For reference, I consider Robertson Davies to be one of the best fiction writers ever. He can write an 800 page novel about a small Canadian town putting on a community play, and make it widely compelling. This guy takes a wildly compelling idea and makes it barely tolerable.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show reveals the interaction between characters well. It's concept is good and it hangs together over all of it's episodes.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This fantasy drama features characters like Snow White and Rumplestiltskin. In this second season, the curse that landed the fairy tale characters in the &#34;real&#34; world with fake identities is broken, but they are not automatically returned to the Enchanted Forest. Now that they remember who they really are, they're faced with new problems. Each episode is rather compelling, if often melodramatic (even soap opera-like). Highly imaginative, often exciting, with some great performances (especially Robert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin).
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Parts of this book absolutely tore me up.  It amazes me that anyone claiming to be religious could treat another human being with such cruelty.  Loved the main characters.  Very powerful in lots of ways and gives you something to really think about.  Great book!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  Well worth buying  I like it so much I bought it for my niece because I didn't want to give up my copy.  Great read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love all the Downton Abbey. But the end of season 3 didn't end like like I would have liked. Can't wait until Janurary 2014 to see the next season.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was such a great story full of twists and turns, I couldn't put it down.  It has everything a great novel needs: a terrific storyline, fast-paced action, drama suspense, made you feel like you were there!  I can't wait to read Ms. Flynn's next book.
B0094K1K42|2.0|It was not a good movie.  Too much unhappiness, drinking.  It was not a movie I would expected Charlize Theron to do.  I do not recommed this movie at all.  very disapointed.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Love return to Cranford, but then I usually enjoy anything Judi Dench is in, she is such a terrific actress. It is also interesting to see the period of another time portrayed and contrast it to our present time.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is a hilarious movie.....LOVE these characters!!! Its one you will watch over and over and over again !!!!! I hope they make a sequel.
1451695195|5.0|Understandable writing of his neuro problems and his story of afterlife.He was very believable and very wonderful in his understanding of life.
B0050UEVNM|4.0|This was a cute and interesting stories of each couple in the trials and tribulations of life and its challenges. All actors did a great job.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is an incredibly good start for this freshman author!  It was pure entertainment.  Read almost the whole book in one sitting. Can't wait to see what this author comes up with next!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Although this show is fiction, it is the closest thing you will see to true reality shows you will see on TV. As a veteran, I really appreciate the work of Army criminal Investigation Division (CID), NCIS, and sister agencies. I used the CID in Germany to expose suspected contractor fraud and saved US taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great in the car, for a dinner party (background) or working around the house. Every track is wonderful! Even my teenagers downloaded the songs to their IPods, and it's tough for our family to find music we ALL can listen to!
B00CWV8X04|1.0|This movie never seemed to get to the point.  I just didn't get it, unless it made the point when I was dozing.  I didn't think the acting was that great either.  I think the effects and cinematography were excellent however.
0061537969|5.0|I love this book and might name my next dog Enzo. Spiritual, Emotional, Mental, it's all there. It's a novel can be read at many levels - Do we all have the qualities of each of the charecters? Is it a lesson for society? But it's equally enjoyable as just a story. Quick read.<br /><br />My 8th grade daughter and 11th grade son loved it just as much. I've done two book-club readings with great discussions. But IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY. It's a talking dog, folks...you have to get past that and into chapter 2 or you will think you are reading about Marley, which it is not. Enzo is a vehicle for telling a story as an observer, but one we get to know intimately. You won't look at your own dog the same.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|great movie one of terrantinos best. enjoyed even better than the first one. has a lot of action in it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lots to talk about, I recommend this not only for enjoyable and provoking reading, but also discussions. Many levels to read into this story.
B00BR476TG|4.0|Good Movie, better book.  It's great to see films in this format. I enjoy viewing movies in this format. Good stuff
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book I've read that I hated everyone in it. All the charecters are despicable! But I couldn't put the book down! Loved the book, kept me interested, very well written with surprises.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire stopped charging when using the charger provided with the unit.  This replacement charger, issued free of charge by Kindle, sorted the problem entirely.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|You have to respect these guys for honesty, humor and intelligence, something lacking in much Pop Music and Hip Hop. Everything I have heard from these guys is great (Note that I am outside of the typical Hip Hop Demo, being an older white male, but I like to respect and listen to all genres of music as long as it's good. For example, Kanye despite having an ego the size of Texas has done some great stuff, as have Eminem, Dre and Kid Cudi as well, but Macklemore and Ryan are adding some new messages to their inventive sound, and addressing some of the harsh rhetoric, homophobia, etc.). Oh, and to Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy: Why don't you try listening to The National, before hating on them? I have long been a fan and it doesn't have to be either The National or Macklemore. There new album, Trouble Will Find Me, is another Gem.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am ashamed I even read some of this book. I got to the contract and the minute I saw what he was detailing I was ready to be done.<br /><br />This book was horrible and I didn't even finish it. My boyfriend's mother bought them from amazon and said oh hun its a must read. Here I am out camping with his family reading this book his mom said was just so amazing.<br /><br />What a joke...I was so bored but I continued to read because I thought I would maybe stumble across some interesting stuff...the sex was not even interesting.<br />If anything this killed my libido more then improve it.<br /><br />So after hitting the contract chapter of the book and also laughing reading it out loud to a male coworker we found this book together nothing but a ridiculous poorly written porno. We flipped through this book and continued to read out loud some of the most ridiculous scenes. We sure burnt off a good hour of boredom at work doing this.<br /><br />Then comes the Tampon scene. The most disturbing thing ever. My male coworker stopped in his words and said WTF did I just read? He asked me what kind of guy would even wanna go near a vagina during the red tide? I grabbed the book and read it. I was disgusted.<br /><br />Some of this book had really stupid unheated sex scenes but the tampon scene for the love of God why a tampon scene its just disturbing! How many of you ladies out there have a boyfriend who would want to pull your tampon out? I know for fact mine would rather put his hand in the garbage disposal then go near a vagina to pull on a tampon string.<br /><br />I give this book a hefty rating of death in my fire place. Gift or not I can't even believe I got this given to me by my boyfriend's mom. I wouldn't even recommend this book it is so poorly written and repetitive. I am so sick of Ana biting her lip because Kristin Stewart's version of Bella constantly licked her lips in the movie. I've read better fanfictions on Deviantart that have more plot and character development then this crap. And to finish this off: Christian is no more then an emotionally and sexually abusive man towards Ana. If you like that kind of stuff by all means its for you. I for one find it sickening in this book along with the poor writing.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I enjoyed seeing how the events unfolded, after having watched the story unfold on TV so many years ago. I suppose I would have enjoyed the film more if it had less profanity.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Saw it in the theater and the award-winning cinematography really loses a lot in the translation to the home screen. It's an interesting story. I don't like the the existential mind gravy offered at the end and felt tricked.  Still, the movie has so many wonderful qualities I had to give it 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It is for more age appropriate people to play.  I liked the movies but not so much the game. thanks for the opportunity to try it out.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This will change the way you think about food forever. Since we ingest food and it becomes a part of us, sure makes sense to put clean stuff in. If the the FDA really worked, there would never be any recalls or crazy mad cow disease.  Feeding herbivores other dead cows and chicken manure just doesn't make sense! This isn't normal. Love the super smart organic guy, Joel Salatin who butchers his chickens in the outdoors. Super cool.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|A very melodic album.  Album opens with some harder beats and more aggressive sound, and then transitions into FOB's melodic, up beat style (which I love).  Sounds a lot like music off Under the Cork Tree.  And Elton John on the title track...come on!!  love it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly easy to understand and helped me understand how using quantum physics can be used in our every day life. loved the book.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Fun game, requires you to &#34;restore &#34; the kingdom in a logical manner to avoid the dragon (time running out) .  Different levels with different challenges, great time killer.  Works well on Kindle, no glitches at all.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|This album has a lot of emotion and we get to see into her life a little more. I love Demi and I really love her new album. <3
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It took me about half of the first book to get sucked into the story, but now I can't put it down and I'm on the third book.  The characters are fantastic and the writing is superb!
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Enjoyed it, like Ed Harris, be is good in westerns in my opinion. Its a shootem up movie where the good guys win in the end.
B00ANY94A0|5.0|I sent this to my grandaughter as a birthday present, She lives across the country, She seemed excited and happy with the legos. Legos always seem to be a great fit for children,
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you were disappointed in book four's rambling and disjointed non-storytelling, you can rejoice with me in this redeeming tome. Martin has picked up the story again and continues the telling of the tale. The sticky details of everyone's life is still described in long-handed chapters, but it seems he has found a better balance that doesn't distract from the story and often enhances it.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I love this movie!  It is a great love story! Since purchasing it I have watched it over and over!
B00AK57N00|5.0|great very addicting. I love it. a little hard when you get to the furthure levels. good for people that are good at video games.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|This novel was very confusing, with too many characters and descriptions of the diamond mining business. I had trouble finishing this book.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|This music is great, enjoy it with a cup of coffee and a good book, have it in the background while enjoying wine with friends or put you headphones on and go for a run.  Cher and Christina are amazing!  and let me add if you have not had the opportunity to see the movie, do it now, you will not be disappointed
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|In the end this is a very stupid movie. Macho guys stand opposite each other and shoot hundreds of bullets, most of which miss the target. Every male actor who is working these days is in it (my second Nick Nolte movie this weekend). I loved the songs used in the movie from that time period as well as the cars and costumes. During the gun fights I was more concerned about the cars then the people! I wish the woman from \\"The Killing\\" had a larger part - I love her. If you like the old \\"G-Men\\" type movies then you will like this one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. For the most part it has less glitches than some of the other bingo games. Play it everyday!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Flo has done it again!  Great Dash game just like the rest of them!  Love the new scenes and upgrades!!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Great story concept. Well casted. Only shame is it was cut short. Check out the movie Serenity for some closure.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|Does most of what I need. But the iOS app is so much better. Why? There is no way to select multiple files, for instance.
193700788X|3.0|I really liked the first few Sookie Stackhouse books because they joined details of everyday Southern life with the supernatural and had some humor. In addition, they didn't make me feel like I was reading porn with the love scenes, as so many other supernatural novels seem to do. However, over time (and I think most series are like this), Charlaine seemed to lose steam. Don't get me wrong - she still is great at thinking up and skillfully developing the plot, but the other aspects mentioned above (particularly the humor) just seemed to fade away. I'm not sad that the series has ended, but I am going to go back and re-read the whole series, because they are a good read - and I won't have the frustration of waiting for the next book to come out.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay, just finished and damn I really really loved that one.  I read hundreds of contemp/erotic romances a year and trust me, many of them suck bigtime.  Half the time the five star rating is a joke...not this time.  Seriously, who could not give this book five stars.  Written from Drews point of view with a hilarious voice over take to it.  I love the characters, plot, and that it wrapped up nicely in the end without dragging into a three book series.  Steamy with emotion, i actually almost had a few tears form there in the end.  Going in my &#34;Loved It&#34; category, which is a huge compliment for me.
B000SGGUWS|2.0|I teach 8th grade and several of my students have been reading this series. I finally decided to see what it was about and was shocked to find pot smoking, teen/adults having very inappropriate relationships, underage drinking, and the f bomb used throughout the novel. One of the teen/adult relationships involved a teacher! Last, the reader is left without answers. I have the sneaking feeling, with the amount of books in this series, closure is far away.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Great for students or parents. Common ideas that people generally ignore. Enjoyable read. I read this book in one sit.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Highly addictive.  Time flies when you are having fun....,and dinner doesn't get made, nor the wash finished. Beware of time constraints when playing this game.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read Gillian Flynns book Gone Girl, and read the sample book at the end for Sharp Objects, had to read that too.  She is a good author with interesting story lines that keeps you coming back!! I'm off to read her other book this weekend....Dark Places :)
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|It's hard to find the words to describe this album.  I found it beautiful and haunting, but everyone will have their own unique take on it.  Many people have said this is not true Thirty Seconds to Mars, but it has all the same components as the previous albums, just at times lighter than the other albums.  Jared, Shannon, and Tomo made an album to be proud of it.  It's intimate and I feel like I get to experience the journey they took to create this with them.  I'm proud to have this part of my collection and proud to be part of the Echelon. :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was very well written, and kept me going back to it!  Don't understand at all why some people didn't like it.  Perhaps they thought it should end, like they thought it would end?  Well I have to say it was a quite good book! Go ahead and read it.  She is a very good author.  Have since read Sharp Objects since finishing that book, and next I am reading her other book Dark Places.
B009K86D86|5.0|We all should understand where our food comes from and how is processed. Knowledge allows you to make choices for yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because its a fun game. I mean every time I play it I keep<br />getting hi scores.My casin Alexei keeps getting girls in subway surfers in<br />China.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if I were u, I would so get this! it is so much fun! you learn to stop being so addicted when ur parents tell u to do ur laundry! ugh! :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This was recommended by several friends so I started watching it not knowing what it was about at all. The aliens and stuff threw me off a lot. I was utterly confused but stuck with it a few more episodes. I started to like the characters more and more and love how creative the writers made their journeys. It's a great show for those who love sci-fi types and/or love to use their imagination.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good story, with hot, forbidden sexual desires, yet somehow innocence plays a big part..didn't want to put it down..can't wait to read the next one.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I am surprise that they made a movie out of this book.  I did not see the movie and after reading the book I have no i9ntent to go see it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like very much good gameplay bit annoying can't see how much to upgrade building s so have to wait. Expansion is a bit annoying ax well
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Make sure you read this series in their proper order.  Another great story by Jeffery Archer.  Hard to put down and I hope he left the end of this book where he can add another one in this series.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Outstanding go to bible,love the contrast aspect(good for night or day reading)would like to see a study bible for different versions
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Great game. Loved the old school feel of the game. Match 3+ usually don't hold my interest.  Combined it with rpg scroll element, I'm hooked! Took me a while to notice how to upgrade the accessory rooms after buying all available items. I received as faotd, would gladly pay $1-2.00.  took me 5 hours to finish the 1st time. I'm ready to reset the game and keep playing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor is a must download. You can use $$$ but it's not required. Travel through rooms finding objects and completing quests.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Really bright light.  Useful in dark situations where you don't have light immediately available.  I'm hoping I don't have to use it much.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack reacher is a well constructed character who uses brawn and brain to extract himself from extremely dangerous situations.  It is non stop action from beginning to end.  Looking forward to more reacher adventures.  Would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an &#34;out of the box &#34;type of hero.
B00849F82E|5.0|You would think it was all old-fashion but it is not! It is so funny and rich and wonderful. Of course there are some dated stuff and things I didn't understand, but it was amazing how much was still completely real to the world we are in.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|it's not a easy app to operate. I don't understand how to use it to it. No clear instructions on how to operate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally love subway surfers it is sooooooooooooo much fun to play please download it will make you happier and it is awesome!!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A thousand splendid suns is an unforgettable story. It draws me in and makes me feel what the characters feel; the love, betrayal, pain, and the memories. I just simply LOVED it.
193700788X|3.0|I went into this book thinking this had to be the best because after all this was the last. I was very disappointed, not only was the story line off but the ending was just too unbelievable. I mean Sookie ending up with Sam..... come on when did Sookie settle. Oh well lets hope True Blood Season 6 is better than this......
B008I43DYU|5.0|Good app and very easy to use.  The whole family uses it and it's very convenient when you need to do something in a hurry.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Can't get over the same actor plays McCoy in the new Star Trek - but he does an excellent job here.  And the helmet stays on the while time!
B009QU9X44|3.0|This is an ok book. It should have been a great book. It was not a great book because Adichie goes on for far too long about Africans in America. A good editor would have spotted the issue and sorted it. Shame. If you have not read Adichie before I highly recommend her earlier books.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|You think typical John Wayne Flick........ not so much. The ending is heartbreaking.<br />Great hero..great villian ( Lee Marvin at his best). IMO, Best Western of all time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Have enjoyed this DVD greatly. The visual scenes are extraordinary and the soundtrack music is excellent. Visually stimulating and excellent educational viewing for children
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Another great &#34;survival after the apocalypse&#34; story.  If you like SciFi and other survival shows (The Walking Dead, for example), then you will enjoy Falling Skies.
B004TI1WME|4.0|Good app to replace the basic calculator that comes standard on most tablets and smart phones. I especially like the tape feature.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Shortly after purchase (about 1 week) I was unable to open the game. It just flickers and stays at the carousel. No error codes.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Well worth the money. Entertaining and tells a very good story. Excellent date night movie. Highly recommended. Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were excellent
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln - the movie was excellent. It showed the harshness of war, but didn't overdue it. We thoroughly enjoy watching it.
B0035LQYH4|5.0|Heath Ledger was outstanding in this role of classic retelling of The Four Feathers.  I never heard of it when it out in theaters, but I now consider in my top 100 films.  The supporting cast was wonderful too.  If your of fan of Heath Ledger, the Four Feathers is must see!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise, I was not expecting this good of a movie. But Tom Cruise rarely lets me down. It was really good with a lesser actor the story may have been a let down but with Cruise it was great! The action was believable and the character was believable. I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed  A Few Good Men and The Firm you will enjoy this movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very entertaining, the acting and story are superb.  This series is captavating from start to finish, can't wait to watch season 3.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy.<br />Went back to the movie while reading this book to refresh my memory of the characters.
B0012HEB32|5.0|Incredible writing. Incredible acing. Great action and fx. Lena Headey is awesome as is the entire cast. Really, even if you didn't like the Terminator movies, you can watch this and be transported and really get into this series. It is simply executed brilliantly.<br /><br />One of the best television series ever. And I have high standards, for me M*A*S*H and Hill Street Blues are the zenith of writing and acting- but this is also up there with them.<br /><br />Brilliant!
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book was interesting but very indepth and wordly.  if you are a chemist you'll love it other wise, move on.
1250027624|5.0|This was a great gift foir Mother's Day.  My mom really enjoyed it!  Delievery was fast and my experience purchasing this item was very pleasant.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It's a fun game - no talent or much thinking to play it.  You just keep trying to get to the next level.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a good book with likable, realistic characters.  It's told from 'Pat's' point of view so you have to keep reading to learn what happened.  Very funny with several laugh out loud moments, I would highly recommend this one!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|The creative spirit of Cirque keeps on expanding. Even when they combine elements from several programs to showcase the most unique talent, it continues to amaze.
B0089LOG02|3.0|It is a good story line but the writing is average.  If the writing is good, embellishing isn't necessary.  Just average.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Even better than the reviews and awards intimated. great special effects and drama for two most unlikely shipmates who strive to survive.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Just what i needed when i forgot our alarm clock while traveling. Didnt need all the extras so was great.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Have loved this musical for some time and am glad it has finally been released with one of my favorite performers playing the lead. Hugh Jackman, of course. Even better than his &#34;Oklahoma&#34; .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game. Great for car rides!  No problems with it so far. Even my two yr. Old likes it...
B003UYUR0G|5.0|We just loved this movie. I am a huge fan of fantasy time travel movies and this was great! I loved The Mummy Movies and this was close to same lines. highly recommend:)
B00CS65JS2|4.0|DISCLAIMER:<br />I've been a fan since HOmework, I was 12 years old when that came out.<br /><br />Is this Daft Punk's best album? NO<br />Does it contain some of the best songs they created? Yes<br /><br />Truth is, this album is a complete different direction. It only has maybe 3-4 funk songs the rest is a mixture of everything.<br />We like Daft Punk because these robots have SOUL. You can feel it in every one of their songs they create(electronic music-wise). This one was more or less created by different musicians, not just Daft Punk.<br /><br />A LOT OF CREDIT should go to Paul Jackson Jr, he's on almost EVERY song on this album and he just brings some nice funky rhythm with his guitar playing. Especially on the track \\"Beyond\\", he just takes you on a TRIP with his guitar.<br />{I just realized the track 'Beyond' has the same Bass Line as Michael McDonalds 'I keep Forgettin'. They were clearly influenced by that song}<br /><br />He's pure talent, just like Nile Rodgers, who unfortunately is only on 3 songs on this album.<br /><br />The drum players Omar Hakim and J.R should collaborate more often with Daft Punk, drums are off the chain.<br /><br />I'm a fan of all music, I'm also a big NERD fan and a Neptunes fan. The 2 songs with Pharrell are good, Get Lucky being the best one. Lose yourself to Dance could've been better, imagine<br /><br />ONE MAJOR PROBLEM: This album has been over-mixed. I was expecting a more LIVE sounds, since they recorded everything with live musicians. Sounds very flat for live sessions. I listen to a lot of old albums from AC/DC to Led Zeppelin, old-school funk music etc, and it just doesnt sound the same to me.<br /><br />My Favorite songs are Instant Crush, Game of Love(this song will not get out of my head), Motherboard, 'Doing it Right'<br />pretty much the whole album except maybe 2-3 songs.<br />Motherboard is on a whole another level.<br /><br />You will find more funk on the Discovery Album and Human After All. It is a nice Summer album to listen to.<br /><br />If your a fan of Music in general, you will love this album. If your a electro-house-funk junkie you will NOT like this album lol.<br /><br />I wish they would take the Tron Legacy soundtrack route and expand, make a fantastic album with an Orchestra! And Dont wait 6 YEARS to come out with something new, please.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|CD was great quality and loved almost all the tracks!! highly recommend to all Whitney Houston fans, its a must have :)
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I always knew that the Purple had many different musical blends but this selection of new music if off the chain. They channel the classic Purple sound but expand into jazz fusion, funk and blues as well. I am always nervous when buying new music from one of my favorite bands but just like Joe Walsh did with Analog Man it was phenomenal, to hear DP at the top of their game was the best of the best. One thing that I enjoyed the most, and maybe to the dismay of some DP nut cases, was that they did not fill the time with endless filler solos. The songs were tight, and in general kicked a_ _. I have listened to the CD over and over and now I am trying to master the lyrics like I did with my very first ever LP \\"Machine Head\\". I hope these guys tour in Florida cause I will be there for sure. Nice job Guys.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Very helpful book that is recommended to people who looking for great results. Easy to read. Book would be helpful to anyone in life.
B00CEL09QS|5.0|Great story and hilarious lines.  With Steve and Ryan's relationship it is just quite entertaining! Emma Stone is the character so many women relate to so it has appeal to a huge part of female audience.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love the characters from the first two books and now the next generation. I'm still reading it but already love it.
B00136LS2E|5.0|This music is what emotions sound like.  Alan Silvestri has a unique ability to turn feelings into music and this soundtrack wonderful-beautiful and both sweet and haunting.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simple and fun and gets progressively harder. Enough challenge exists to keep you coming back. Definitely worth a download.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|not for the young, but it was a funny movie.  Always enjoy Ashton in a movie.  Enjoyed some good laughs.
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|It just did not have the humor or intensity as the other die hards, but I love Bruce Willis and I would rent it. This to me is the worst of the bunch
B005RAO0GS|5.0|What can say the lead singer has powerfull pipes. Was left wanting more and more just could not get enough. You can tell that they have a lot of influances that go into their music which makes them the perfect twilight delight.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|It was kind of corney, not that he is so old. The one good thing about this movie was it was an ODE to this person who has made happy and exiting movies all his life, and perhaps his LAST STAND in this area. I bought this movie, and I liked it but he needs to move on (even action but in another way).
B008B3F38C|5.0|Reminds me of the early 80's with aheavier mettalic edge. The singer has a soft voice that warms you're bones at night like so old whiskey. My one irritation is that she doesn't show much voice range which slightly dispointed me but overall a really solid album.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|thanks a lot... this movie was seen the moment I got home.. it has made me feel an unusual good inside.. we have both given something to each other. thank you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved the way this author writes frm a guys point of view - had me chuckling thru each and every chapter!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is super addicting it's so addicting that my 20 year old brother got addicted to the game.I say 2.99 is worth it because this game is awesome!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Just like it looks like, except i think the one that came in the mail was made in China and the one that came with my PS2 was made in Japan!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so good I want to play all day so you should get this game for all ages<br /><br />Great and amazing game for kids and other
B00CW665VI|5.0|Holy hell!  I LOVED this book. I wish it was 8 hours ago, so could start over, and read it again!!!  It was hilarious and sexy at the same time. Drew is just so, he is so, oh, just read it already and you will know what I mean. PC is not it...!!!  If I met Drew in a bar, I would punch him, but when  you read this book and really get to know him, you will fall, and fall hard. Drew is, I don't even know what to say, since awesome does not cover it. I loved him. Emma Chase is a godesse! Loved it, LOVED IT!!!!!!  I wish I could give this book 10 stars, truly, and I have never said that before (and I read a lot of books, and I mean A LOT!)
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Great Product. Quality is great. Sweet ass sound on vinyl i swear to God it is awesome as s*** I swear.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|Could not understand the words during 1/2 of the dialog, Now I see why this movie didn't make it to our theatre.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It was a great deal to get these movies at the price I did. I love the Star Trek movies, 4's my favorite.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|It's very difficult to come up with 20 words to say about this movie. It was not horrible.  It wasn't particularly good.  Marky Mark is an OK actor, he was OK. Crowe phoned it in, which is all that was required.  Zeta-Jones is too good for it. Nothing special about the story, good or bad.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Loved having the series here at home so I can watch it as often as I would like to see it
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I watched all 10 episodes in 2 days ! It's like a good book you can't put down. Don't miss this series.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|Three actors who are probably the best in the business. And the writing meets them at their level. Excellent film!
B00BAVQGS8|5.0|I've been hooked on Monster Hunter Ultimate 3DS and the Circle Pad Pro makes it so much more comfortable to hold and play. I recommend this add on for games that support it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Notch, you've done it again. First Minecraft pc, then Minecraft Xbox, now... minecraft pocket edition!!! You my bro, and you win again.<br /><br />Sssssssssssss....
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Saw the trailer, and thought all the funny parts were already shown, but decided to give this movie a try as a chick flick on a lonely night. It was so much more than I thought! I watched it a few times the next few days, and each time I watched it I caught a new joke thrown in. This movie is HILARIOUS. Definitely worth a couple bucks to own!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son can now play his minecraft on the go! This is one of his favorites and doesn't involve shooting!
B009MYARIK|4.0|A well written book, as all her books are. Funny, and a fast read, withh a good number of pages.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I expected something brilliant from these guys after their other albums, and that is exactly what they did. This album is worth being obsessed over.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|All green screen.  It was poorly shot and acted. The movie seems to have either been edited poorly, doughtful though. Obviously underfunded. the actors and writers could have atleast attempted to entertain the audinece
B00CL50KDY|4.0|I really enjoyed the story because it did something different -though arguably sappy- with the current zombie phenomenon. I would definately recommend it to anyone who isn't just interested in a violent, gore-filled zombie movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|its a fun game. I thought it was worth having to pay for it. it is a little addictive but fun.
B004SUDQ72|5.0|I saw this on cable years ago. Never caught the name, did not watch it all. It did stick in my mind. No one else ever knew what I was talking about. It is not the best, but it is the first of its kind about games. I got stubborn one day and found it at Amazon,<br />I am glad it is now in my collection.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is probably the worst &#34;mystery&#34; novel I've read! The end was very obvious, and the characters were very dull, I hated all of them, specially the husband. Don't waste your time and money, it's so not worth it!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series is very entertaining in a smart way. Something, you do not get much in a television series. I had are hard time at first with her innocence. She got sharp fast! The multilevel stories in every program keep it  interesting. I love it. Wish I could afford to watch the next season. Hopefully it will eventually come to prime.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Excellent show. It shows that Vikings were not so different from the other cultures. Travis Fimmel does an excellent job.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's just like having a deck of cards in your hand. The auto finish function is pretty cool.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Make sure you are listening to this on a good sound system - full range and bass - and you won't be disappointed!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|When a book sticks with you, that's unique. , it's definately one that will make aware of handicaps and even maybe respond differently
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Make sure you listen to it on a good sound system - full range and bass - and you won't be disappointed!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Well, how could anyone rate this less than a perfect score? The DVD itself is excellent, we really like all the director's comments and other outtakes, and we're positively delighted with the price and vendor.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app was free and you can just put in a location and get the weather, maps, severe warnings and if you like twiter and facebook comments from the location.
B00723NWJE|2.0|I just did not like it. It was not the Norah Jones that I've been listening and enjoying all along.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It lets me catch up on shows that I missed first time around...and I love the Good Wife...could watch it over and over again.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|I love Willie Nelson but this record was toooo slow for me. I expected more vocalizing and just more of something.
B00COQTZLS|4.0|This app is much better than what I was using. I loved the ease of transfer from another 3rd party.  The quick view in the month calendar is very helpful. I like the labeling of appointments. It allows for quick filtering. So far I really like this app. I wanted to give it 5 stars but I found that I really miss having a widget with scrolling quick view. If it is included with the app I have not found it yet so I feel that 4 stars are appropriate.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Tom Clancy novel . . . he never fail to disappoint and this novel is very relevant to the times and believable.
B002LB7S10|5.0|Intense and very scary with surprising scenes at every moment. Will keep you on edge of your seat.  Don't watch this one alone !!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I had waited and anticipated this one for quite awhile but watching it didn't ever catch up with my expectations of it.  Too bad-it was so convoluted that I found it difficult to follow the story line-if there was a story line rather than some vaguely related characters separated by many years of connection.  I got sleepy and bored and quit before it was over.  Maybe I missed the final attempts to relate these characters that hopefully occurred nearer the end?
0812993845|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books and have read every one.  Wedding Night was a cute book, and I enjoyed it.  However, it was not up to Ms. Kinsella's usual standards. To be fair, if it had been written by an unknown author, I would give it the highest marks. Since it was written by her, it's only ok because previous works have been so outstanding. Every other book I have read by her has led to my husband asking, \\"What's so funny?\\"  This one did not. It kept my attention, but I was glad to see it end.
B003B02O14|4.0|This is really a good read.....maybe even a 5 star at that!<br />It's been awhile since I had read a Grisham, but I was happy to get back into his books.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|love getting access to the new NCIS episodes right as they are released for tv..  I have had no problems downloading the shows to our dvr and on automatic subscription they just come to my email...would highly recommend this product!
B00447L4KA|5.0|You can never get tired of watching this move. I am so happy I got it and it was in great condition Love it
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I love this movie!  Beautifully done, great music, lots of fun, inspiring story.  This has always been one of my favorites.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for may years. You never get tired of this move. The quality was awesome
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I am surprised. I thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic werewolf flick. But Red Riding Hood IS actually a good movie. Red Riding Hood is not just a fairy tale. The movie is surprisingly thrilling and actually suspenseful. Amanda Seyfried(who has very beautiful eyes) plays the title character Valerie. Supporting cast includes Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Max Irons, and Virginia Madsen. The Supporting cast and Amanda Seyfried all did a good job. The Storyline is not quite like the story and honestly it really helps the movie. Its more of who is who rather than the \\"My what large teeth you have'' lines and The End\\". This movie goes really deep into the mythos, which makes it very enjoyable and great to watch.<br />Make no mistake, Red Riding Hood is not the best movie I have seen, but it is one of the better films adapted from a fairy tale that I have seen. So in short, Red Riding Hood gets:<br /><br />3.5 stars
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is actually much larger in person that it appears in the photo and I was instantly satisfied with my purchase. It came in a well padded packaging and the backpack itself is pretty well padded. The zippers are soft, comfortable to use and open smoothly. The pockets are fairly sizable and the straps are well padded and give good back support. The interior as mentioned is well padded and the Velcro separators can easily be adjusted to suit your need.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of the most unique twists to the &#34;match 3&#34; Bejeweled-type game genre that I have ever seen:<br />  RPG style gaming? Check!<br />  Retro Atari 2600-style graphics? Check!<br />  Power -up? Enemies to defeat? Checkpoints? An actual goal to achieve to win the game? Checks for all of those!<br /><br />This is the first game I have downloaded in a long while that I absolutely could NOT PUT DOWN! I played this game for over 4 straight hours working my way up....<br /><br />Then I hit 10 million points, and it was all over. That's my only problem with the game: it's too short! It seems like 10 million points is impossible to reach early on, but as you continue to build up your weapons and armor, train, and use potions....it's not difficult to achieve. Oh well...I guess I will be using the &#34;erase all data&#34; function to start all over again. The game is that good! It's definitely worth a couple of bucks!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|We love how this show continually brings in new and interesting characters from different tales that we all grew up with. The developing new sub-plot has a ready fro season 3.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is an awesome game(s) that are really fun to play and sadly work better on a kindle or ipad rathervthan a phone.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|Still as good as when it first came out. With the all of the Moby Dick references it will always be a classic. This was the best of the TOS movie franchises. I had to re-watch following the release of Into Darkness.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The movie was very nice, but none of the movies based on sparks books have been as good as The Notebook. I forget who directed  and produced the Notebook, but they should have done the others. I would recommend this movie to others to watch on amazon but I wouldn't buy the DVD.
B00ATK02WM|5.0|I saw this movie on Television. I think Gerard Depardieu is a good actor. I enjoy the movies he plays in.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Les Mis. is a magnificent classic story that will never grow too old . If you have seen the film first you will not recognise the book initially, as the story mainly revolves around the true goodness of the priest that puts Jean Valjean on the road to a productive life in society .Be patient with this book as it takes a looooong time to read,but is trully memorable and well worth the effort
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My kids love this app! Great graphics and lots of fun...should get us through an 18 hour car ride we have coming up.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I love this app! It has a regular camera, a video camera, a timer camera, and so much more in one app! I would highly recommend his - it's by far the best camera app for the Kindle Fire HD!! The only flaw is that the Kindle itself doesn't have the option of filming without the screen facing you... so that's irritating. Not the apps fault, though.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Christolph Waltz is more than a supporting actor - he is fantastic!  Jamie Foxx plays another role type - he is so versatile.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I hate this app so much I could only film three videos and then it said I had to get cam coins which u have to buy or u have to do something for a company to get free cam coins which some of the things u had to buy stuff so really didn't get free cam coins don't get this app it doesn't even deserve one star I'm saving u heart  ache right now telling u not to get this app this is the true secret revealed and I'm going to tell u about all the apps game's and books that are good and bad.<br /><br /> Truly,<br />  Cats rock
B008VO3PA4|2.0|It started out cute but the language and content became  inappropriate as I continued to read.  I returned it right away.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|To me, the movie has no thrilling moments, no suspense.  I've seen much better acting from Ben Affleck.  And I noticed in the credits that one of the advisors was Huma Abedin, advisor to Hillary Clinton and wife of disgraced NY mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, who has a long history of involvement in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood/Sisterhood, as do her parents.  I've had my fill of Muslim infiltration, propaganda and viewpoint.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Great album. Considering this is her first album, this is a good album. It has a soul/funky theme to it. I love all the songs (rare for me for an album...theres always one song i don't like) not with this one. All the songs are good. Amazing artists who needs more credit.
0131103628|5.0|This update on the classic and Best book ever written teaching the C programming language has big shoes to fill, it does this hands down!  Having been a C programmer for 15 years before getting cancer, I did use this edition in the last years of my professional career.  In my previous job I instructed and mentored junior members of my team.  In that position I personally spent my own money to buy books to find the best books to teach junior members.  Out of 20 odd books I bought, read, & reviewed for my job - I felt K&R was the best.  The only drawback most junior members commented on was that the solutions to exercises were in another book that they had to purchase.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This album tops Unbroken- It has catchy songs and personal ones. EVERYONE can relate to this record. BUY IT!!!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO!!!
B0027Z5DM6|1.0|So many sexual innuendos and foul language. Sexism throughout the movie. Definetly not a good movie for a family night!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm just getting started on this game but I'm really liking the way it makes me think. I'm hoping to work my way up to more suits. I like this better than basic solitaire.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I had not watched commercial television for some time. When this program was suggested as a program to watch in my Dish guide, I decided to watch it. I was very pleased that I did. The actors do an excellent job with their characters. The episodes are well written, and leave the viewer with a sense of &#34;What's next?&#34; I also like the excitement and the intrigue. The stunts and especially the fight scenes are believable and exciting. The best part is the character development of each character.
193700788X|3.0|I have been invested in the characters of this series for over 12 years, loved the supernatural characters of Bon Temps, Sookie's pluckiness, and the love story between Eric and Sookie.  Their humor, wit, and adventures were what drew me in for a decade...so what happened here??!! For the last 3 books, it seemed that Sookie had become whiny, hypocritical, and judgmental! Where was the Eric that we all loved?  Yes, he is self-involved, but always charming, yes he can be manipulative, but always with Sookie's best interest.  He got her.  Why did Ms. Harris changed the essence of Eric...so that Sookie could end up with Sam \\"for now?\\"  Sam is wonderful, but the ending seemed so unnatural and not \\"right\\" with how the characters had been feeling for each other. I am disappointed in this finale because it seemed that even though it was \\"practical\\" for Sookie to choose Sam, it did not seemed like he was her true love.  Disappointed in Sookie's sudden change in tune in this book and the last couple of ones.  She judged Eric's vampire actions/choices from a human point of view and expected him to make \\"human choices\\" to make their relationship work.  Not fair and unlike the Sookie of earlier books who didn't want the humans in Bon Temps to judge her by their human standards!  Isn't that why she was so intrigued by the vamps, because they didn't judge her negatively for her special gift?  Better ending would have been to leave Sookie alone, show a little more closure for her breakup with Eric...and in my fantasy world, 200 years later they could meet up again (she never aging because of her fairy heritage!)
0425263908|3.0|i understand it's a used book but this should of been labeled as good or a lower condition. The book had like a coffee stain on pages and the cover corners were pretty beat up. Thanks for the book though
B0051BVQFG|5.0|A very interesting movie of catastrophe, with decently developed characters, good actors and theme. It was a very pleasant experience watching it.<br />It has a high Marine morale, that raises your heart as you watch sacrificial soldiers do and die for their country.<br />It is also a moderately believable story, except for the aliens of course. :)
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Both my kids (5 and 2.5 years old) love this app.  I love that they are actually learning (as opposed to mindless game play) while being entertained.  Cute graphics and pleasant sound, too.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Let me start off by saying, if you don't get this movie, you really aren't trying. I watched it with a relative who isn't very bright and he could explain the whole ending. So as long as you understand what reincarnation is going into the movie, you will have no trouble understanding it. Also, if you want just an action flick don't watch this. I don't believe in reincarnation and you don't have to if you want to love this film. I loved the characters, the plot, the symbols, the messages and the visuals. An amazing movie that I will rewatch every so often for the rest of my life. Enjoy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved seeing both Ana and Christian evolve in this last book of the series. Really liked the in sight on Christian's thoughts.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|Good story line, and the added bonus of semi naked men dancing is a plus. Mathew is a little odd, Channing is hot! =)
B005LAII1C|3.0|One was the one that resembled the trailers, which our entire family found to be hilarious, and another (R-Rated) that was unsuitable for watching with our 11 and 12 yr old granddaughters!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I find this fun and entertaining in a relaxing way. Will probably buy the advanced version once I get good with the free verion.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This album was the only album I played all summer and really this is all I needed. Frank Ocean isn't your average singer. His lyrics are very different than most. He tells a story by describing something from a certain point of view for a reason. I think its cuz so he can fill in the little details while you imagine the big picture. The songs here are very smooth and calming (no bump and grind business). I wouldn't be able to pick a favorite song on here and make a \\"great choice\\" so i wont try. I will say that this is one of the only albums I've heard in a long time where I don't have to push the skip button. The skits can be kind of annoying but they add to the concept of the album, which i guess was just watching T.V. and flipping channels. Which if you think about it doesn't seem like much but Frank fills in with his own creativity. I highly recommend this album to pretty much anyone just because it's so different compared to what's out now on terms of the lyrics, production, and vibe of the album. Worth every penny!!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I liked the ds games, but remix is stripped of the best features. There is no challenge, and coming up with creative solutions to the puzzles is difficult as the system steers you towards a small set of options it will accept. The ingame currency is completely worthless, you can't buy anything with it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Dynamic interwoven characters<br />Cross Genre Entertainment<br />Joss Whedon - need I really say anymore<br /><br />Once you watch this show you will become a die hard fan
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love this game! It is a great pass time.!  Something mindless to do when I need to check out!  Great
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like all the different games.  It is easier to win than other games I have played before, but still fun.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Saw it on Broadway and liked it better than the movie...not that fond of closeups!  It is a keeper nevertheless.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you're looking for a way to kill some time this is as good as anything out there.  And you're competing against you and the clock.  It seems so simple and yet your eyes can play tricks on you.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Can watch over and over again. The dynamics of all the characters provides great entertainment. Great show all around!! Love love love!
B00371V6SE|4.0|I enjoyed it, easy reading and the characters had a lot of depth to them and you felt like you really knew them.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|other then Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise)  being a little supernatural, I enjoyed the movie. A lot of action and recommend it.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I wouldn't recommend this Ap for Facebook, It constantly jumps to advertising, doesn't allow for consistent  interaction and is generally frustrating.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Tom's most memorable line from the movie, &#34;I am not a hero!&#34; puts it in perspective.  You know he is, so just embrace the banality and be entertained.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I too want a 2D version but i personally would rather have the 3dblu ray & a DVD instead of just a blu ray.  in our house we only have blu ray in the living room & in my parents room-i have an old play station that will play dvds. so if i decide id rather watch in my room, i have the dvd. i could care less about the digital copy...if i want to watch it on my computer, i would just put the dvd in & save the computer space! to me, and this is just my opinion, it is better to have a dvd option as well to bring places in case someone doesnt have a blu ray. the dvd may become obsolete eventually but it hasnt happened yet.<br />also, the blu ray 3d with 1 disc doesnt mention if it has extras-like the regular blu ray/dvd + digital copy says. it only says its the theatrical version.<br />lastly, i do reccomend seeing the 3d version if you can-i dont usually think 3d movies are very great-the 3d isnt great or worth it (except in animation for some reason) but i loved this one. i enjoyed the whole movie.<br />i only gave this a 3 star review bc of the lack of dvd-but id give the movie 5 stars!<br />good luck to everyone in finding what you want! :)
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised it was not annoyingly repetitive. Good simple model that kept me entertained until the last run.
0756407915|2.0|When I read The Name of the Wind, I thought it was my new favorite book, but with A Wiseman's Fear, all my enthusiasm died out. I just got so bored with Kvothe's never ending \\"adventures\\". Besides, Rothfuss didn't explain a thing in this book, with only another book left, he'll have a LOT to say about how Kvothe became who he is.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|This is an enjoyable ending to the saga, the highs and lows of Sookie Stackhouse, I will miss them all.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I would recommend this game for taking a break from work or kids when you have a few minutes to yourself.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I really like having all the movies in this franchise together in one package.  The packaging itself, though, left much to be desired.  The little envelope which contained the individual Blu-Ray discs were hard to remove without smudging and the tacked-on title sleeve was attached with a single dab of ineffective glue.  This package replaced my VHS copies of the Indiana Jones trilogy and my DVD of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />The pristine video quality of these blu-ray discs met all my expectations and viewing satisfaction.  I just wish the producers had taken as much care in the packaging as they did with the blu-ray media.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|The tip of the pacifier is completely rounded as opposed to the slightly curved ones that contour to the inside of the baby's mouth better. I suppose it all comes down to the child's preference... in our case the little one isn't a fan of the strictly cylindrical pacifier nipple so he won't keep this in his mouth for long. Still fun though and can serve as a slight distraction.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very cute, lightweight monkey. Almost worth it just for the stuffed animal<br />Sturdy pacifier with no rubbery taste, holds up to biters<br /><br />Cons:<br />The monkey is only attached to one end of the pacifier, which makes me worry that it will rip off if the little one decides to pull too hard. Every time I pick it up I think &#34;I hope this doesn't rip off as easily as it feels like it could...&#34;
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|Got it for my daughter.  My wife thought it might be too advanced for her reading skills, but my daughter enjoys reading the story.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Taste in music varies broadly, I listen to Stirling while I study and it keeps my energy and work tempo up.  I love the fast violin work and mixing it with techno is surprisingly nice  (I am not much of a techno fan).  Just bought the album recently and I've played it over 10 times.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|game was interesting.  I would have given it more stars but it kept freezing.  It also caused problems on my Kindle Fire
B000IZ4R1U|1.0|Like every movie that was ever based on a video game (except for Wreck it Ralph, which doesn't count because it's not based on a real game), this movie is horrible.  The story is almost unbearably cheesy, and now that it is outdated it is even more cheesy.  The movie has some famous actors in it, which they probably regret now.  Jolie has a taste for these types of roles (Salt, Wanted, Mrs. Smith) for reasons I do not understand.  Maybe she just finds them fun.  It is also somewhat shocking to see Daniel Craig in this, since he would eventually be recognized as a talented actor.  Only watch this for laughs or because you need reminded that even good actors and actresses play crap sometimes.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Atrocious, bad, mind numbing, pain staking, offensive, wit less, stupid, class less, waste of time, money and thought. Just a few things that describe this movie.<br />Enjoy
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book! It's a true mystery thriller that keeps the reader wanting more and more!  A real page turner....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because you take care of a horse and play games for 2 year old s and up
B000007VCO|5.0|If you are a Santana fan and missed some of these you want (need) them.  Great songs and riffs and Santana at his usual best. A little on the jazz side for Carlos.
B000HF0ISC|4.0|Excellent cast of characters. Amazing how with a little of misdirection you cansomeone off that committed murderer. Pitt. Hoffman & Patrick pulled it off.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|If you are a Santana fan and missed some of these you want (need) them.  Great songs and riffs and Santana at his usual best.
B009C7JS14|2.0|The app was cool,, unfortunately you can only add two cities.  If you want to add more, you have to pay for the upgraded app.  I don't think they mention that in the description.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|If you are a Santana fan and missed some of these you want (need) them.  Great songs and riffs and Santana at his usual best.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Loved the whole concept of the show, and this opening season had some quality episodes.  But the producers, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, kept creative control to themselves.  They wrote most of the episodes, which gave the season a very bland feel.  For instance, in &#34;Silent Enemy&#34;, that whole subplot of trying to figure out Malcolm's favorite food was just ridiculous.  And from the start, the entire temporal cold war arc was ill-conceived...  Fans wanted to see the building blocks of what would one day be The United Federation of Planets, not some of these silly stories about the crew fumbling about and making fools of themselves on Risa...  Still worth watching.  Star Trek is like sex, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good! ;-)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo online game so far but very addicting from day one just wish for more credits every day
B00C1S945G|5.0|Season 2 saw more character driven episodes, and by far one of the best episodes of the entire series, &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34;... that episode exemplifies what Star Trek is all about!  Other noteworthy episodes are &#34;Pen Pals&#34;, which takes a hard look at the Prime Directive (loved the argument amongst the senior staff in Picard's quarters), and &#34;A Matter of Honor&#34;, which dives into Klingon culture.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Thrilling Suspenseful Action-packed Fun and Exciting - if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it
B0086221SS|5.0|No actress currently working can express as much emotion with a single bleak gaze or shy smile as Michelle Williams. Sit back and let this quiet film by that master of understatement, director Sarah Polley, work its magic on you. Funny, sexy and ultimately immensely sad. Seth Rogen reveals hitherto unseen acting depths as the husband who knows what his wife needs but either can't or doesn't care enough to figure out how to give it to her.  This is a gem.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the better of many books coming out now (since White House leaks) on the subject of Seals and special ops.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I had low expectations for this film, but was pleasantly surprised to find it fresh and entertaining. Tom Cruise is such a better actor now in his early 50's than he ever was in his 20's!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the storyline, the characters, the costumes, the time period, everything about this series.  I started watching it on Netflix because I couldn't find anything else to watch and ended up finding my favorite show.  Just enough drama to keep you interested, but not totally over the top like cheap tv soap crap shows.  I even got my mother in love with it too!  Though, out of the three seasons I have seen so far, season two was my least favorite as it centers around WWI.  I don't feel like this show needs something like a world war to intensify it... just the family dynamic, and the servants stories are enough.  But, I eagerly await season 4.
0525958002|4.0|Made me(always a duranie-for as long as they've been around!) go back and relisten to all the fantastic music they've made. A good read, too!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Love this book, wonderful deep & rich story. I find myself looking thru and buying more from this Kate Morton.
B006U1Q8ZE|5.0|nice book, first heard about it in an old mag, i recommend, came fast, looks interesting, im vegetarian, so it fits predictions.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|And I usually don't cry.<br />Great acting.<br />It made me love my family more.  Everyone with kids should see it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I enjoy hill climb racing and originally started playing it on my ipod touch. I wish that I could sync my game across both devices because I have finished game on ios but do not want to start again. all griefs aside, overall a good game
B000002WE9|5.0|This is one of Elvis' best concerts.  He sounds very relaxed and is having a ball doing the show.  He ROCKS.
193700788X|2.0|I have loved the Sookie Stackhouse series since the beginning and have anxiously awaited the finale.  I am not sure what happened with this book.  The main plots of the story felt as though the author was grasping at straws and was struggling with how to wrap up this long journey.  I felt like she made an attempt to make sure every character over the years was represented and in doing so, created a book that fell short of expectations and lacked excitement.  With a series that has leaned so heavily on vampires and werewolves, it was extremely disappointing to have random humans as the main troublemakers.  Especially humans that were characters of Sookie's past that barely existed and were quickly forgotten.  The vampires and werewolves that MADE this series played very minor roles in its conclusion.  The story lacked the passion and page turning excitement that readers have come to expect from the Sookie novels.<br /><br />I wish this novel could be re-written so that this amazing series could end with dignity.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, you can't not read the ending, but be prepared to be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel is a nice app for now.  I just replaced it with accu weather because the app for acuu weather is not running right.
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|I built all six cabins in pirate. island.  doesn't acknowledge it ...Pd and cant play!!<br /> i like it. but level wont acknowledge  that i have built all six cabins!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I got a message that John Grisham is doing a sequal to A TIME TO KILL.  I read it a few years ago, but wanted to read it again so as to be ready for the new book when it comes out.  Previously I had the hard cover book.  This time I purchased it for my Kindle.  It is a good story.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Crisp Graphics just like it is shown in the picture.<br />The character classes are good an  easy to get into.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is amazing and really makes you think about your significant other and why they and you do some things and how you can speak each other's languages.<br />Highly recommended!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it. Its worth every penny I give so if u love the bat or the cat. Buy it
B003M6EAXM|3.0|The movies theme is ok, it has exellant cinematography perception. Fine characters. But I think it has to be more realistick and full of high drama.
0756655307|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of this book. Its hard covered and weighty with excellent art work. I am very happy with my purchase.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Want a regular keyboard? Try Touch Keyboard. Want something like Swype? This is less user friendly, only three suggested words, takes about twice as long to type and correct than Swype does. Overall, a waste of money.
B0098460O4|3.0|Well, classic music done very well.  Individually I like their voices but together she seems to be a mismatch to his.<br />Overall enjoyable.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|It works really well and I like the input. I especially like that the answer is displayed in fractions, with the decimal equivalent displayed above it. It would also be nice if you could enter a decimal value and then use one of the functions with fractions to operate on it. If it could do that, it would be 5 stars.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is a milestone in psychology and since I'm not an expert, I can only give my opinion as an informed reader. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the human condition, whether you are a doctor or (like me) a writer. It will change the way you approach reality and relationships. The author cleverly involves you and shows you how mistaken your approach to problem solving (probably) is - indeed, he throws doubt in your whole life! After reading this book, you'll find yourself constantly trying to &#34;slow down&#34; and re-think right through your first reaction to any challenge coming your way.<br /><br />A must read.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great addictive game! You can't stop playing and trying to keep enough time to  make your goal !  Very good game!!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I picked this book almost as soon as it came out and blogged about it abundantly (my post was read by many aspiring author looking for the marketing Graal) and for a while, it looked like John Locke had unlocked the success to book selling. I stayed away from reviewing it because I couldn't for a long time make up my mind whether his &#34;loyalty transfer&#34; thesis - the central thesis of this book - made any sense or not. In my view, the quality of the advice given depended very much on whether this thesis was true or not.<br /><br />Now, almost two years later, I'm pretty certain that it is vastly exaggerated. The book is full of good advice, no doubt about it, but you need to take with a (big) grain of (your own) salt. Loyalty transfer is of course a concept that is very fashionable in some advertising quarters and it may even work. But one thing is sure: it's not easy to apply and requires a deep knowledge of your audience. If you don't have that, it won't work. So read this book by all means, but be aware that all that glitters is not gold...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the show so much.  Wish there was more every season.  Happy that I am able to watch on my Kindle
B001AQQR2S|4.0|My eight year old daughter loves this movie!  She can watch it over and over again!  She has been watching it since she was 4.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Good timing and disk played well! The packaging was meticulous and the item matched the description perfectly! Thanks for being very consistent and following through 100% on your products!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|I owned this for a month and while in theory the iphone aspect seems perfect it just wasn't convenient to have to rely on my phone for notifications of my baby crying.  If the phone wasn't configured correctly, or was in do not disturb mode it wouldn't make any noise at all.  Plus I always had to make sure it was on me and turned up so I could hear it.  I quickly decided that I was going to need a dedicated unit that would make noise as soon as the baby did.  I decided on the motorola unit below and couldn't be happier.  My favorite part about it is how sensitive it is to the baby making real noise but at the same time how the speaker will actually turn itself off when there's no or next to no noise in the room.  That way you don't get this constant stream of white noise and hear every single peep, snore, and rollover.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VL2VRY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004VL2VRY&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse grabs you from the beginning.  I would not recommend it for small children because there are some very dramatic scenes that may not be appropriate for  them.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Intriguing, suspenseful, and can't stop watching it!! Can't wait for next season! Have it on re-order but have heard nothing yet, as I believe it is now available!!! Waiting impatiently for it!!!!
030746363X|5.0|Ik weet niet wat ik zonder dit boek zou doen. Iedereen moet dit lezen. super!<br />Lees ook Tim four hour work week en four hour chef.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|this is just pure delight, engaging story, just a real pleasure to watch. I would highly recommend this series.  It also helps to see the other seasons as well.
0547884591|5.0|Ik weet niet wat ik zonder dit boek zou doen. Iedereen moet dit lezen. super!<br />Lees ook Tim four hour work week en four hour body.
B000001FFR|4.0|This is a very good Anthrax cd but I realy should have gotten the cd Sound of White Noise,although excellent music I personally think its Anthraxs #2 great LP,after Sound of White Noise. Live and learn
B000003TA9|5.0|Sonic Youth was popular coming out of Seattle prior to the Grunge movement.  Really they could probably be credited with getting record labels to hang around the Northwest looking for bands in the first place.  The punk sound they brought would make most listeners believe they were from NY or at least New England.  Always great writing and blending of sound, intoxicating lyricism and teeth gritting orchestration, a good buy for any punk lover.
B000007VCM|3.0|This cd in my opinion only has 2 great songs from The Cult,Rain and She Sells Santuary. I guess I should have gotten a more wider variety of their other great songs with a &#34;Best Of&#34; cd,and this would be my recommendation to others looking to purchase this cd.
0765325950|5.0|Best ending the series could present without the original author and that is enough for the book to have a solid ending,
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The best rap album to come out in years. There isn't a song on this album that I don't like.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game thought it was going to be a boring city building game, but it's not it's amazing<br />It's great
B00B4804KS|5.0|Obviously really cool movie. 3D just made it better all my kids love it I mean I watched it when I was a kid in the theaters and had it on VHS. I'm glad my kids get to experience it like this.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|It left me with the feeling that he \\"mailed this one in.\\" Archer is capable of much more than was evidenced by this book.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I tell you what if your a Micheal Jackson fan don't waste time, just buy the movie. Great picture quality, great sound. I love it man reminded me so much of my child hood growing up watching this on VHS mind you.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great series, watching season 1 for a second time.  Catching more nuances in the performances.  Everything about this show is great.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|The premise of this book is delightful: running away from reality. Great character development throughout but this is just too long because of all the irrelevant flashbacks. Initially intriguing became burdensome.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tried other note apps but this is by far the best. I love that it integrates over all my devices. I like the ability to click on web pages and save them and that it uses photos and voice options. I would highly recommend.
B000FC11A6|3.0|By now everyone knows roughly the subject of this book: interlinked stories based on code breaking during World War Two,  paralleled in the 1990s. There is treasure hiding and treasure hunting. The heroes are appealing, with a moral sense, with values.  It is fascinating, often funny and imaginative. The linked stories work well.You don't feel cheated or frustrated  when one stops and the other begins . The reason I didn't give it four or five stars is two fold. Much of the book consists of a sort of war porn. I ended  skipping the endless descriptions of horrible deaths, tortures, and mass murders. Plus the approach is that only the Americans can be good guys, because , well, because everyone else is bad, and the US stands for chaos creation leading to progress and intellectual evolution. I wonder if one single reader would like the different facets of this book. I liked some of them a lot, not others.  One has to be amazed at the author's creativity and energy, and impressed at his seriousness.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I know when a movie is a remake it should be better then the first, it just didn't happen this time but I still enjoyed it. It did start like the first but that is about all after it was all new.
B001N4OX82|2.0|Overblown...Dialogue was cheesy and Brad Pitt's persistant duck face while trying to look pensive was a bit much. The CONSTANT mention of the future fame of the war and those involved was unrealistic and unbelievable.  The costumes were silly and the characters one dimensional.
B004IFYN2E|3.0|This is the kind of movie once you have seen it no need to see it again, You will enjoy the movie not much action
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|A twist on the abundant library of dystopian futures, this series soon became mired in the usual clichés and my interest waned by the end of the pilot.  I may try again after a while to see if the actual series will offer something more unique.
B0019EXZYE|5.0|This is one of Statham better movies, I know it's the same story line as most action knowning what will happen at the end of the movie but this time it did surpise me just  a little. Like Mel's movie he didn't get paid for the bank job, the mob knew he was the best in the buisness and had him to lay out the plan when the job was done they wanted to do another, he didn't want to, now you know where it goes from there.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|In chronological order you will learn about the child, teen and adult Bob Marley. You will watch interviews with friends and family as well as old family videos.  I learned a lot about this spiritual, generous and talented man. Great movie for fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute, detailed app. I downloaded this so my kids could play. They love animals. I think it has great graphics and I have had fun playing. Great deal since it was free.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have come to expect nothing less from Philippa Gregory. Her ability to tell a single story from different perspectives is a rare talent.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|Excellent story and direction. I can only watch every so often due to the very devastating nature of the movie's content.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|I mean eveil ducks taking over the bath tub on level 12 it gets harder it gets eiser once you get the hang of it  :)
B00B9366VO|5.0|Nice show about the history of sound city and those who recorded there. Told by Nirvana's Dave Grohl. Includes input from some huge artists. Definitely worth a watch.
B004I744AS|2.0|It was hard for me to use.  I couldn't always get it to work the way I wanted it to.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|A good and easy family movie.  You can read as much of a life lesson into it as you want.  Yeah Jay!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Super cute characters!  You get to save your pengiun and you don't have a limited time to save the penguin.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|built a new puter and decided to move up in the speed area and this sure does.  I did not used their cooler though.  for 29.00 more I bought a much better one and just ignored the one it comes with.  you have too much invested to use a so so cooler.  29.00 is cheap insurance on a couple hundred dollar investment.  also do not cheat on the power get at least bronze certified or gold certified.  also get a power supply with Japanese capacitors not Chinese junk.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|At one point it is hard to play but it gets better the game is great fun to play it
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Pros:<br />Great game<br />Very Convient<br />Not confusing<br /><br />Cons:<br />Tries to make you buy in-app purchaces<br />Costs $2.99 and free online
B005TBN04S|3.0|I didn't think this one was near as funny as the first. They attempted to revive the reactions that the first movie got by using some of the same gags and one liners used in te first movie. It was alright but I wouldn't purchase it, and would only watch it again for free.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game knows almost every word. It even understands most adjectives! For example, if you type in hungry girl, it will appear. If you put a pizza in front of it, it will eat the pizza!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was another validation of the truth of eternal life that is expressed as a continuing process of our spiritual unfoldment.  It was entertaining and informative and based on sound scientific truths.  Heaven is for everyone, not a place, but a process.  Well worth reading!
B0086700CM|4.0|How can I give a negitive review if it is free. Plus, it works well. The major con is that it tries to make you buy in-app purchases.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|I had high hopes for what I would now call an overrated movie. Not the first time Amazon reviewers had led me astray and surely won't be the last. 4.5 stars? Three is being generous. The movie could have been much better if it picked a side....serious with a little comedy or comedy with a little serious. This film seemed to not have a good balance between the two, constantly rotating between serious and absurd...at times painful to watch, lacking all matter of sense and reality. If it were just a silly comedy this would be okay, but passing itself off at times as a more serious film with a message, it just does not blend well.<br /><br />3 stars is a tough sell, as it was a okay movie to watch but I would not try to talk anyone else into spending 1.5 hours of their life on it.
B003E74B24|4.0|I love Gordon Ramsay,s Hell's Kitchen & Master Chef programs.  After reading his autobiography, I understand him more and realize why he mentors with tough love.  It's nice to see someone turn their life around as he did.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Read this while away on business. Typical of Grisham, it takes a while to get going and is a tad hard to follow, but by the time you are 25% in, you're hooked. If you enjoyed JG's previous legal thrillers, you'll like this one.
B00932A4XE|4.0|The movie was great.  It had good humor with a great cast.<br />The part with the men in the park was very funny!
B005URRCUY|4.0|I wanted 4.5 stars but,  couldn't. I like Brothers better, this is the next better album. One of the best new bands out there.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Another great movie to add to our collection. This series always gives us lots of laughs every time we watch them
B00BVVA138|5.0|The new KsE album is one of the best (if not THE best) yet. Jesse's voice has improved significantly since he left the band after &#34;Alive Or Just Breathing,&#34; and his lyric writing has always been powerful and meaningful. After the more-or-less shallow lyrics of their recent self-titled effort, the songs on &#34;Disarm The Descent&#34; leave one feeling inspired and challenged. Musically, the band just continues to get better, with their sound involving more and more variety and depth. There are even some old-school hardcore elements on this one. Great release from Killswitch. I can't wait to hear more now that they're all back to the original lineup (plus an actual drummer).
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I watched it because of Keir Gilchrist. I like watching the movies that he has been in.  It was nice to see that something good came out of the time that he spent in the Psych ward.
B00628RVV0|5.0|To the end. The blending together of the time period, the cruelty of adults, and the innocent of childrens, amazing.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater and the final credits rolled, I knew I had to own it.  Amazon typically offers the best prices on new blu-ray DVDs, so this was a no-brainer.  Love This Movie!
B000AP04OM|5.0|Bought as a gift for my husband and we have both enjoyed it several times. It's a great family movie.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Very neat!  Easy to use!  I struggled with fractions as a kid and now that MY kids are learning them it makes it so easy to check myself so I know that I am helping them!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I've been wanting to read Gone Girl for quite sometime. It was one of the best-selling books of 2012 and several people I know read it and loved it. Being a fan of thrillers, I expected this novel to be fantastic. Boy, was I disappointed. It took 140 pages for anything vaguely unpredictable or interesting to happen in Gone Girl. And the first 140 pages made me happy the girl was gone. I don't know about you, but I don't have a ton of free time. I'm used to excellent thrillers by authors like Harlan Coben that grab me from the first page and never let go. I'm also used to reading about characters I can relate to and therefore care about. This book failed miserably on both counts. While the last third of it was mildly compelling, it didn't make up for the first two thirds being mediocre. And as many people have pointed out, the ending was unsatisfactory and lacked closure. While I'm glad I finished Gone Girl, I don't plan on reading anymore novels by this author. This book, just like the girl, are better off gone.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Watched about fifteen minutes of the movie, its horrible! Does not resemble the book in any way shape or form. I want a refund of the $4.99 just as if I had gone to the movie theater or rented it at a Blockbuster.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I've lost a lot of sleep because I can't put it down.  George Martin captures your interest and soul with this work.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The animation was great and the story line was fine. You have to like the characters in this movie, each was funny in their own way. The whole family can enjoy this movie.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|i think this is the best game ever because it's like you get to own a real zoo and catch animals
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Hard to keep up with the plot, spins in many directions past and future at same time.It is ok but you don't want to leave the room for a minute or you might view the rest of the movie trying figure out just what happened.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|For those who love hidden object/puzzle/adventure games I highly recommend this one. I don't want to give anything away so will just say the graphics and storyline are very well done. Just a note, the game has multiple HO scenes but plenty of puzzles and other objectives to fulfill. Also, once you have completed the game be sure to go back and play the bonus material as it really adds to the story. I'd love to see a sequel. Kudos to G5 for a job well done. *I played on Kindle Fire HD(7inch) and the game play worked wonderfully.*
034554398X|5.0|one of the longest in the series and sets the stage for alot more to come later on cant wait to keep reading
B003GK22HK|5.0|I found it absorbing, and I really felt involved with the characters. It was difficult to put it down. It was very thought-provoking.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I purchased this kit as a replacement for a cheap PC repair tool set I bought a couple years ago. I've read good reviews about this particular product in the past, and remembered it when I decided to go tool shopping.<br /><br />My first impressions:<br /><br />The bits are clearly labeled and neatly organized. There are definitely enough bits to cover my needs as a hobbyist/tech. I recently fixed a tablet for a friend of mine and it was a beautiful thing to actually have the proper tools for once!<br />I haven't had an opportunity to use the flexible extension yet, but it seems like it could be useful. There was some excess grease above the plastic sleeve, but that was easy enough to clean up.<br /><br />The driver itself is wonderful. It's light, thin and easy enough to work with. As other reviewers have stated, it can be a bit slippery. There are only 3 thin plastic strips to serve as a grip. So far, it hasn't been an issue for me, but I can see sweaty palms and fingers causing problems down the road. Just something to keep in mind. A couple strips of electrical tape could help quite a bit.<br /><br />The case is just plastic with a snapping lid. No thrills, but it does its job. There is an upgrade for a nice looking wooden case, but it was a bit too pricey for me to justify grabbing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great kit and a welcome addition to my tool bag.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really enjoyed this; the characters were reasonably well depicted and the story was absorbing; it was a pity that the follow-up was not as good;
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I'm hooked. This show has unexpected twists and turns. The clones all have such different personalities and looks. I love this show.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|I loved this; it really absorbed me. It was brilliantly written. I would almost certainly read it again , and find I had missed something.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the love story that I was so hoping to find in the end. This was a trilogy that I couldn't stop reading. I literally read all three books in 8 days. Although many things seemed to repeat, I didn't mind too much. I enjoyed the story, and am looking forward to more!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed the story but I never felt very involved with any of the characters. In theory  the story was fascinating, but in practice, it was a bit simplistic and not sufficiently thought-provoking. Enjoyable but not deep enough and too similar to the first book, The Pillars of the Earth.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addictive and fun . You become hook very fast. Can stop .  Good game to pass the time away. Everyone from kid to adult will  enjoy :-) .
B000W93CHC|3.0|A good read but too similar to the first volume and it felt a bit like reading a children's book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Cute movie! Loved that kids and adults could enjoy. Lots of cameos and a good plot made it worthwhile for my family and I.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my grown daughter as a gift.  She was delighted!  She plans to have it at a Dr. Who party.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's think that this has a cool world seed that is jpgaming spell it the way i spelled it p.s i got it from a friend also if you swich around the j and the p dig strait down where you start you will find diamonds then go on survival and mine them with a iorn pickaxe
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Just as the three before this one, I was hooked and had a hard time putting the book down! Thank you for giving me a series that might get me through this summer reading fun :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So much fun playing this game only wish there was different cars to choose from maybe as the game goes on.  An offer of a roll bar for a limited time would be fun.  Other than that I'd have to say it's best game I have played in a long time; started playing and haven't stopped!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love Dr. Who, Rose is a great partner for him. Anyone who claims to be a SciFi fan has to watch Dr. Who. It's a requirement!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This move is beyond delightful. Very modern and played out beautifully by the actors and actresses. A quirky, cute, funny drama that really won a place in my heart.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music and great watching the audience (all ages) respond and enjoy. Watched uit three times in two weeks!
0802473164|5.0|Or should I say my fiance loves it.  I am currently deployed, I had 7 days to get ready and leave, this created stress in our relationship.  Everyday my fiance would talk about what he learned in the book and he actually read it all, surprising.  I have to say that my relationship with my fiance is better than ever after reading this book.  Just waiting on mine to get to me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I  Love the Hunger Games  Books so much. They are awesome. This one was sssooooo sad I cried a few times but other times I couldn't stop smiling. The Hunger  Games are the  best books ever and always will be.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo was an excellent story, and revealed new information about the Iran hostage crisis and the Carter administration. I didn't give it a five star rating because I'm not sure this is a movie I would watch a second time, but only because I now know the story and it would have the same impact.<br /><br />There is some irony in the fact that a movie about making a fake movie won the Best Picture Oscar. Perhaps next year's formula will be to make movies about the best pictures never made, but I think this is a one time, fluke occurrence.<br /><br />I don't know how much dramatic license was taken in the making of the movie; however, I suspect that the dramatic scene at the airport was overplayed in the movie to build to the climax, but I'm not sure the movie could have won best picture without the added excitement as most of the movie develops slowly in order for the audience to understand the role of the various characters.<br /><br />I know that Ben Affleck has some amazing talents, but I think he would have been better off in casting someone else to play his role while he worked behind the camera. Casting his friend Matt Damon might have been too obvious, and George Clooney might have been over the top; however, I can think of several males that would have been more interesting choices (Matthew Fox, Paul Giamatti, Tom Hanks, and Johnny Depp to mention a few 'A' list actors.)<br /><br />Still, it won Best Picture, so that makes Ben the winner.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was super good. It keeps u at the edge of ur seat. I read it in a day. It has a AMAZING CLIFF HANGER.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is cute, and enjoyable in the fact you don't need the internet to play. Unfortunately eventually you asked to use diamonds to complete tasks you'd eventually have to purchase. These games always end up going for your pockets.<br />TBull
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love to play this game. I am getting the hang of it and play with the grand kids. Thank you
B006H5120E|5.0|I'm still suffering a little hypothermia from this movie.  It looks so good in 3D that I was a little surprised I don't have wet feet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love the creativity the kids have with this game. They are learning at the same as just playing a game.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I've seen this movie in 2D and loved it but the 3D made it even better!  There was a time or two when I jumped out of my seat before something could get me!  An truly awesome experience!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Thanks for the quick download and having such a great game for the grand kids to use and enjoy thanks
B004ELSDZK|5.0|The game is challenging enough to make you really sit back and think. However, at least so far, it is not so hard as to make it totally frustrating. I recommend it if you like logic puzzles.
B00846REIS|5.0|A little more intense then fifty shades of grey but I loved it and can't wait to read the next one!! :)
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and this app makes it easy to do I give it a thumbs up great
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoy the games from G5. They have a good story line and good hidden object games. Buy it now!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Really like this set up wish it had a few more alarm sounds to choose from but over all great
B009GED3HS|5.0|not a fan of season finale, I wanted more... just showing the &#34;mother&#34; at the train station was not enough!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I feel this is an awesome game very quick to learn and great for killing time. Only reason I didn't give it 5stars was u can only be one char and the floors are pretty short but other then that is a great game to play.
B004L8BM90|5.0|such a great movie. Kathleen Turner is pitch perfect as a middle aged woman going through a divorce. when. she finds herself back in high school armed with the knowledge of what will be she wants to change her destiny. But can she ? Barbara Harris is terrific as her mother (why didn't she get more work ?)  And Maureen Sullivan in a cameo as her grandmother is just wonderful. The meloncholy waltz in the score sticks with you afterwards. 5 stars.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Often times I have a hard time following a story line, so I'll often not finish a book.  This story focused primarily on one person and his situation, so I could put the book down a couple days and pick it back up where I left off and still keep track of it.  Parts of it are rather tedious - a lot of calculations dealing with food, water, power, oxygen, etc, but drove home the importance of such things I suppose.  I would say the author really focused on making this story very reality based.  I can't really think of any areas that were &#34;far fetched&#34; - it was entirely believable.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Love the movie, love the score! It's emotional and dramatic, just like the movie. You can never go wrong with John Barry.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond 23 lives up to the hype created for this 2012 release. Acting is great, the locations are great, the cinematography is great, the weapons are great, and the cars.....just watch the movie and find out. The best part of the film is at the end of the credits, which states boldly &#34;James Bond Will Be Back&#34;. Come on, 24.
0061353248|5.0|This book and Pete Lunn's Basic Instincts demonstrate that behavioral economists are beginning to understand that the mainstream picture of how people act is woefully incomplete.  It is written in an informal style that is easy to understand and enjoyable to read.  It may be overstate the likelihood once we understand that we are subject to influences that would not be included a rational cost benefit analysis will lead to good policy.  He recognizes that the same irrational decisional tendencies are also used by sellers of fattening foods and bad social policies.  He has no solution for using the insights of behavioral economics only for good.  That does not lessen his contribution or that of other behavioral economists.  It means that more work needs to be done.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen takes you back in time when men were gentlemen (mostly) and women were... shall we say, tame and gracious.  None of this running about and flaunting your sex.  Makes you wish you were living in that period of time.  Things were simple and free and honest.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I really like  this program. It keeps getting better and better. Interesting premise, lots of twists and turns and good acting.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Another wonderful series from our friends across the pond! Engaging storyline & well done acting. It is interesting to see how the British handled the resignation of their King & the building of the power of Germany.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really loved this book. Percy Jackson learns he is a demigod, or half- blood, meaning his mom is human and his dad is a Greek god. He is acused of stealing Zues' thunderbolt and Hades' helm, and must go on a dangerous adventure with his sidekick satyr, Grover, and his new friend Annabeth, to clear his name and set things right. There is truly so much going on in this book, constantly a new challenge for Percy and his friends to conquer, a really great storyline. My only complaint is the corny writing here and there, such as the use of \\"man\\", \\"dude\\", or \\"lets whup some butt\\". If you can look past that, it is definitely a good read. One of the best books I've read in quite a while. There is a couple of parts that might be questionable to kids younger than 10,  although it doesn't give descriptions but implies certain violent actions that might leave your imagination wincing. But the author knows how to not dwell or make it grousome for the intended ages.
B00008EY9G|1.0|So I liked this movie until they got to the whole part where it's in the guy's head.  Then I felt cheated.  I'm a big fan of the Christie story, and of thrillers, but this did not work for me.<br /><br />I admit the whole thing with the convict transport was bothering me (why only one cop, etc) and that twist actually made sense.  The cast was great.<br /><br />I was already irritated by the end, and how stupid is the psych guy?<br /><br />I am glad it was only 90 minutes of my life lost.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm not saying the book was BAD, but for the end of the entire series? Come on. Very anticlimactic. I wish more things were explained and set in stone.
0385471378|5.0|This book has even more of what I watched on the movie. I was looking for it and finally found it! I can read it over and over again, really love this book.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|This is a cute feel good movie.  Great to watch with the family.  Definitely not the greatest movie ever but it is entertaining.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just cant belive it! This app has been around for only a month or so and 350 people already bought it! Job well done.it is a really fun app
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Slow and boring. Not funny.<br /><br />However, My 60ish in laws watched it first and said it was a hilarious movie.
B0040GURF8|4.0|I knew very little about John Mayer's body of work before I heard him play on a recent country music awards show. It was an interesting performance, so I thought &#34;Live in Los Angeles&#34; would be a good starting point for a purchase.<br /><br />This trio delivers a lot of sound, haunting melodies with captivating lyrics, many of them written by Mayer.<br /><br />Highlights for me were the acoustic softness of Neon, Stop This Train, and In Your Atmosphere; the reggae-style Waiting on the World to Change; the Hendrix-infuenced Wait Until Tomorrow, Who Did You Think I Was, and Bold As Love (Hendrix cover). Other notables are the incredibly beautiful Why Georgia, and Heart of Life, plus my album favorite Belief.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album for the rollicking rock/blues guitar-loving aficionado.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good app for keeping in touch with friends. Could use less annoying privacy glitches though. I would also like to see see more button options, like a Dislike button.
B002R88G4U|2.0|Did not particularly like the format of this book.  Found it had too many characters and was difficult to get a perspective, too much concentration.  The latter part was much better than the beginning
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent part of the series, well written, and keeps your interest. I find the author to be a brilliant man to keep various characters going in all directions and various plots. Excellent read! Waiting for next series to find out where I left off; series should have been already written so you could continue........leaves you with a void!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie. Despite how wonderful the movie was, it will never mach the magic of the novel. I'm a therapist. This book treats mental illness with amazing accuracy and tenderness. It's rare to find a story written so well that at times you feel like the mentally messed up character in the story. Mr. Quick achieves this in The Silver Linings Playbook. I can't wait to read this again!
B004OXCL5Q|5.0|Saw this on a big screen in 1962-63. I loved the BIGNESS of this movie. Some say bombast. Who cares?<br />As a 10yo, I was not so tuned in to Loren as a beautiful woman, but  Ximenne as a lover and mother and something of a mother confessor.<br />Heston I'd already seen in Ten Commandments, and I think, Ben Hur by then. He plays pretty much the same character.<br />(That seemed to be his life plan).<br /><br />I got that the rather cute Genevieve Paige was a Lady Macbeth type, and wonderfully haughty. Hammer should have used her in \\"She\\"<br />Frank Thring plays a slimey poop, as usual..not enough of his simpering and slyness, against the \\"Spanish\\" Muslim  Moutamein's honor and dignity. Herbert Lom comes across as asomewhat crazed Moorish Leader, Ben Yusuf.<br />The wrangling male infantas as useful as square wheels...more Shakespeare, but here, their Dad dies early.<br /><br />Rodrigo's fight with Ximenne's Dad, Gomez, who regretably has to die for the story to work...more speccy than any swordfight I'd seen before.<br />The Duel with the opposition's champion, more speccy and gruesome than usually seen on screen...except perhaps in Spartacus (Douglas).<br /><br />The huge battle scenes, the wonderful armor, costumes, even as a child, I wondered at the making of such in the 11th century, and the costs involved in such recreations in the 1960s.<br /><br />This work was not greatly loved by critics at the time....perhaps tiring of \\"epics\\"<br />Certainly, the language was uninspired too much of the time, the love scenes too long.<br />Mulling over this more recently, it occurs that it does repeatedly make true distinctions between Revenge and Justice, which distinctions are more often not made. The Cid does get it, along with Moutamein.<br />Ximenne has to learn it the hard \\"love conquers all\\" way<br /><br />But, I reckon this movie a pinnacle of the American Movie art, a small notch below spartacus, Ben Hur, Ten commandments. I don't know that the Americans realy keptgoing with the big Biblical--Middle Ages costume piece much beyond this. Shame.<br /><br />This BluRay transfer captures all that I remember visually...and this is a BIG SCREEN show, boys and girls.<br />The sound is a bit thin...but the original is 50yo. Clearly a big leap in sound recording quality happened later in the sixties.<br /><br />Etched into the mind of this now 60yo was the final scene, of the supposedly dead Cid riding his horse along the beach at Valencia into history. And the Muslim host running from what they thought must be a ghost. We are left to wonder whether the Cid was still alive or not. Great cinema.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is amazing. I thought the first one was good, but this one even trumps it. Plus they keep updating it! with each update it just keeps getting better
B008O9V4C2|1.0|Though never a \\"dyed in the wool\\" Steely Dan Man, I continued buying up to \\"Aja\\".<br />So often I found their whining Griping vocals off-putting, and eventually, a languid samishness in all they did.<br /><br />I have aded this to a list in my head of seriously horrible records.<br /><br />Only track 4, \\"Weather in my Head\\" gets above first gear.<br /><br />The whole set is lovingly put together, with excellent playing, and well recorded and mastered. The music itself is dreadful beyond belief. Dull, lifeless, funky beats throughout, bit of notional rapping...(no place in my world, admittedly)<br />Devoid of inspiration.<br /><br />How does a group of elite musos get something so wrong.<br /><br />I did look at the large number of positive, \\"best thing since Jesus had the croup\\" reviews, and wondered if I have the correct disc.<br />I repectfully add my voice to the nay-sayers. Unapologetic.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Having missed the first three seasons entirely, I finally took a chance on Haven and watched the entire three seasons in a week-long marathon.  I probably wouldn't have continued after the pilot except for Eric Balfour, who is outstanding, as well as easy on the eyes. His character showed far more nuance and development than any of the others.  Of course, I got hooked, and am looking forward to Season 4 starting this fall.<br /><br />Everyone else has said so much there's little left to say.  Watch this just for the fun of it.  Interesting premise, surprisingly well done for a TV show.  I wish I could warm up to the female lead, but she often comes across as wooden and humorless.<br /><br />Now I want to go live in Nova Scotia -- what a beautiful place.
B000003CMC|2.0|Was &#34;Live at the Filmore&#34; the best live album ever? Very worthy contender.<br /><br /> I confess, to having struggled in my youth with &#34;Whipping Post&#34;, but now find that set, especially the augmented packages, inspired, and deserving of its lauded status.<br /><br />Not so with &#34;Eat a Peach&#34; I avoided it for 40 years, put off by numerous negative reports.<br />Anyhow, I thought, with the benefit of time and experience, perhaps I could &#34;Get&#34; this one. NOPE.<br />Unutterably dull, with surprisingly poor musicianship, a lot of bum notes, erratic rythm, and uncalled-for dissonances.<br /> I don't think the recording is that flash, even for its time.<br />Sorry, to all those Allman fans, I don't believe this is worthy of the band's talents.
1452115567|5.0|Amazing photo book. I love Maddie's story and every photo is so creative and adds to their journey across America.
B00979CS50|5.0|Only Neil young would consider producing a set of extremely long songs with nary a change in tempo, rythm or key.<br />Masterful in its minimalist construct, muddy murky somewhat erratic in execution, as only this bloke would allow.<br />Sampedro laying down his impeccable thundering backing. Young, in voice and in Lead wailing and wallowing equally.<br />Plod Plod Plod. Like a Giant. Indeed. Brand new, but old.<br /><br />If you live in a universe where Cinnamon Girl, Cowgirl in the Sand, and the later magnificence of Ragged Glory dominates your musical mind, this comes highly recommended.<br /><br />I saw Young at a Basketball stadium in 1988 ( then, the closest we had to any kind of stadium, and which Young thought quite quaint, in his snide way). He played an accoustic set for about 45 mins, stood up and told the audience that if that was the Neil Young they'd come to see,  then that was a good time to go home. The next 90 mins was like this new set. Unrelenting thundering plod plod plod. Mindbogglingly entertaining.<br /><br />Only Neil Young could pull that off. As here.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud! I read it in a day. Looking forward to more in this series! If you don't get all serious and just roll with the story you will love this book. It is not that often I read a book with the male POV. Drew was honest, hot, and hilarious!
0545265355|5.0|Excelent box, excelent quality of the books and the design is very atractive. Is really worth the money, for the contents in the book and the book itsefl
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|A fun and adventurous departure from their usual sound. It is almost genre defying but definitely feels like Daft Punk the whole way. The entire album has great energy and emotion with a healthy dose of funk. Daft Punk took quite a few risks on this album, focusing on the truly creative and artistic rather than vanilla formulas used to fill the charts. I appreciate what they have done and thoroughly enjoyed this album.
0345529057|4.0|Masspaper back is a good version for someone who hasn't read all the books at all. Is a way to check it and know if you really like it.
0399226907|5.0|Read this book over & over...too cute!  Perfect for babies & toddlers...very sturdy board book.  Arrived in timely manner and in great condition.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have had many cases for my I phone and this one is the best by far. I am rough on a cell phone and this case does an excellent job. It slides in and out of your jeans, comes in many colors, and works exactly like it says it will. I will never have anything but a LifeProof Case, in pink thank you very much.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was thrilling from beginning to end. I only wish the author was still living so he could to write more of their adventures.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|great movie...excellent acting, the cast was perfect.  would recommend this to anyone looking for a good story and a laugh.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The author seems to be carring out this mission by himself at times. By having to omit secret details of the mission, it is  very unexciting and slow reading.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I paid an extra dollar for the HD version and all I got was the SD version. False advertising at it's best.
B001NLKT60|4.0|It was not nearly as thrilling as the first and third books of the trilogy, but nevertheless, still an above average read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is addicting.<br />There isn't one character that you do not get invested in.<br />The storylines are written so well.<br />Every single actor is superb and seems to know their character so well.<br />Obviously, I have my favorites - Mary, Matthew, Old Lady Grantham, Lady Grantham, Lord Grantham, Daisy, Anna & Bates.  But they all draw you in.  I watched seasons one, two and three in two weekends and now am in withdrawal waiting for season four!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This is one of the few shows that everyone in the family enjoys and as parents we like it in that it doesn't rely on sex, violence, or idiocy. Storyline is very good; though lots of characters, so we often rely on each other to remind us of who the various people are and how they fit into the story.  Some of the scenes can be intense and so not suitable for children under six or seven.  So,  for folks who like the fantasy/fairly tale genre I would highly reccomend this.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I'm not familar with the rules of the game, I'm sure it will get better as I continue to play the game.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really like reading David Baldacci books because they are exciting and figuring out the end is hard. There is always a twist one would not figure out.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good graphics and story. Potions are a pain in the rear end and and although they self replenish two hours per potion
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|The movie seems like a mix of Robocop and Nightmare on Elm Street, with a tremendous mix of blood and guts combined with futuristic hard-to-believe technology. It also appears that someone was looking for a chance to show off the new technology in slow motion cameras while attempting to make a first movie. Not a bad story line but get a little white bag and keep your children away.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Wonder zoo without a doubt is quite fun, my daughter who is 7 simply loves it, but complains when the game freezes after rescuing and paying for the animals. This is the main glitch that needs attention since one has to either restart the game or shut down the device, this is annoying. So the developers need to fix this, otherwise it would have been a 5 star.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|The movie basically cover all the theater productions that Cirque Du Soleil does in Las Vegas. It blends them together well and seemlesly, making it appear as one single story. The performances are magnificent and fun to watch. Definitely a great watch with the family.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|I haven't had to use it very much but it's super helpful when I do. Simple and easy to use
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Cuts out the chaff and delivers 21st century wisdom and experience. The author simplifies the message he delivers (which is one of the lessons he imparts).
0425252868|5.0|If you like WWII history you'll enjoy this book. Unusual story that keeps you turing pages. Recommended to me by a friend who has hundreds of WWII BOOKS.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Of course we all knew how it would end in gross fashion, but the devil is in the details (no pun intended). Lots of action. Lots of battles. Lots of fun!
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Carlos Vives has always been great.  It is unusual for a singer to take many years off from producing and then come back with such a great album.  My family and colleagues all enjoy this album.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great story. Well written. Good science fiction focusing on people more than tech. Made me want to continue on with the series.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I read it over 40 years ago in high school.  I can't believe how much more I got out of it the second time around.  Extremely well written and engaging.  Epic in scope, but relates to the common man.  You won't be able to put it down.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I prefer accessing YouTube on my PC. But this app gets you there quickly and all the bells and whistles are at your demand.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jilian is no nonsense.  It's challenging, fun and tough.  I am definitely going to use this everyday along with my other work out programs. You wont be disappointed with this one.  It is short but gets the job done.  I
B00CBKLO52|5.0|You can choose different types of vehicles. Plane, copter, and more. You decide playing levels. So far the boat gets my vote. It never leaves the surface, well most of the time. Get this app, you will not be sorry.
B005UG542S|5.0|Great effects.  completes the circle.  Harry Potter and the deathly hallows is great to watch and I am so sad that it's over.  I do think it was true to the book, which is a super plus.  I could watch this every day.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|It looks easy, but hold on. Fantastic graphics. This game will take you away on a journey that you never know what will happen.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is very good and it can't get any better I've been looking for the best mixing  dj app and this one is very good
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's nice to have a Calculator handy at all times. It is right there at your fingertips when needed. Works great
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has surprised me with its content. It's a Diablo 3 handheld cross over. The skills are amazing and graphics are easy to understand. The cost is a bit choppy, but makes up for it with the weapon system. Though you will have to pay for some real advantages, you can still find yourself on top of your opponents, or grinding your way to the next level.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Get weather updates at the touch of a screen. Get radar images, daily, hourly reports. Local and National. Nice app.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It was just as good as the first, the storytelling holding my interest the entire way through. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Instant access to Facebook. Image is not the same as on your PC, but access to most important features are there.
B00821OX98|3.0|I have unsuccessfully tried to watch this series twice before. It never was able to catch my interest long enough to get beyond the third episode. Yes, it is formula, yes, it is painfully predictable, and yes, yes, the characters are two dimensional and patently uninteresting or endearing. But, if you substitute DHS, FBI and CIA for the role of the aliens, it begins to have some relevance.
B0040GURF8|5.0|what a great album john shreds on the guitar my first mayer album i bought and it is awesome love it
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|I still enjoy watching this movie, but with each passing year I realize just how much it originally relied on the contemporary world view of the 1980s.<br /><br />If you weren't at least a young adult at the time this movie was released, you probably won't be able to relate all that well to it. but the music is marvelous.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Downloaded this app which installed properly and runs well.  Great game.  Takes a little time to learn by playing it.  I couldn't find any detailed instructions.  But, after getting the hang of it, it's very entertaining.  Definitely worth purchasing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As a long time fan of puzzle based games such as Myst, 100 floors, etc, I couldn't download The Room fast enough after a mere glance at the description &amp; screenshots. It certainly did not disappoint! Breathtakingly realistic graphics make each puzzle feel as if you're working on it in real life; you can almost smell the rich mahogany wood &amp; feel the cold metal of every key! Fluid gameplay combines with unique movements, ie literally turning keys &amp; dials, somehow making the puzzle solving all the more entertaining. The puzzles are complex, but not frustratingly so, and if you DO find yourself stuck, there's a handy in-game clue system to help you along without spoiling anything. The storyline is also fascinatingly refreshing, I for one can't wait to see what's behind Door number two!<br />Much deserving of 5 stars, if I had to gripe about anything, all I could say is it takes a bit to load, but considering the beautiful graphics, that's to be expected! Oh, and it's highly addictive! :)<br />Many thanks to the Devs for a great game; job well done!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|My husband is a HUGE Michael Buble fan, so I preordered his latest release without reading any reviews or listening to any tracks.  Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed by this CD.  While we applaud Michael's attempt at songwriting, we found the songs to be very immature.  The collaborations are so understated, I would've missed them had I not been carefully listening.  And, in general, the album is just...monotone.  Boring.  It completely lacks the energy we've come to expect of Mr Buble.  I'm sorry to say.
B00532A8JI|5.0|I felt that &#34;Paradise Lost&#34; was a masterpiece. I had the good fortune to see Symphony X live at a small club in Seattle, during their &#34;Lost&#34; tour. The sound these guys put out could fill a stadium. &#34;Iconoclast&#34; has taken their music a step further. The production is great. The vocals continue to be both aggressive, and operatic. There are times when the music reminds me of Queen. Michael Romeo continues to prove himself as both classical composer, and guitar hero. For those who enjoy power riffs, this recording is a candy store. Even though this is a 2-CD set, the quality is strong throughout. If you are after aggressive, melodic, progressive rock, &#34;Iconoclast&#34; is a must.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|This is a movie I can and have watched over and over since it first hit. I never get tired of it. Patrick Swayze was a great dancer. His mom had a dance studio in Houston, TX, and Patsy Swayze was a by-word among those who were &#34;in the business&#34; there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This gives me an opportunity to utilize the resource books that I have for my kindle when I am on my laptop.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I had seen the original back when it first came out. I thought it was pretty cute back then...but when I watched THIS version, it made me want to go back and see the original for comparison. I did that, and now will most likely watch THIS ONE again, and I am thinking that this was the better offering. I will get back on this. Both were entertaining, but I am finding that the original NOW seems cumbersome and a little boring in some places. Could have been done better with different actors in certain spots.
B001OL4TR4|4.0|I liked the movie, but I wasn't crazy about the music used.  Beautiful scenery, I think it was filmed in Ireland?
B007Y36K46|5.0|I used to read Edgar Rice Burroughs back in the '70's, when life was much less complicated than what we are experiencing these days. I wondered why they never tried to make movies out of this series - they did the Tarzan thing, and I must admit, Cheetah and Boy never interested me that much. I am so glad now that they waited to make this movie now, because it would have been sorely short-changed by the lack of effects in that day. I would love to see more of this series done, just like the books. A wonderful trip of the imagination.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This was a fun mahjong game. The symbols were distinct and interesting. I liked the colors. There's wasn't a clear help button if you were stuck, but that's not a big deal on a free game.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Random Access Memories is a truly fitting name for this album. Very nostalgic in terms of the content and references. Superbly well-recorded. Really couldn't ask for a cleaner recording. All tape. The musicians on the album are some of the best studio musicians alive, and they collaborated with a handful of exceptional song writers.<br /><br />That being said, some of the tracks are a little forgettable. I also can't really think of any truly knockout tracks on the album (think &#34;Around the World,&#34; &#34;Da Funk,&#34; or &#34;One More Time.&#34;<br /><br />All in all, it's a really, really good album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. It is a well thought out game. I really enjoyed it  .  It was well worth the money.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|Amazing concert in my hometown!!! It's maiden live so if you are a maiden fan there is nothing else to say.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is the first show in ages that I've watched from the first season first episode....so thankful second season was available as an Instant Video... would nt want to miss a minute.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Having this book in my head definitely is going to change my approach on life. This is a beautiful story with good morals and life lessons. Everyone can receive some message from reading this book.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I read Flynn's work in reverse order that they were released in. Since this was her first novel, I'll give her a pass. I find it extremely unrealistic how with Diondra and her extreme drug use, that her child would just be fine. Also I hated the ending. I was only left with unanswered questions
B00AK77WPE|5.0|Witness why a crowd of more than 50 thousand people didn't move from their sites even with such a wild rain!<br /><br />This is an album I had to have, first because that was a memorable concert and second because I Was There! I enjoyed viewing the DVD as much as I enjoyed it live. Arts and extras are superb, the video is phenomenal and the Dolby Digital audio was captured at its best. A flawless Juan Luis Guerra, backed up by his legendary band 4-40, the choristers Roger, Juan, Janina and Adalgisa, and guests like Juanes and Anthony Romeo Santos, are all here performing at this huge rain party, in the last stop of the ASONDEGUERRA tour held at the Olympic Stadium in Santo Domingo in June 16, 2012. The CD is also as good and includes some extra tracks. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />To Amazon: It is not in DVD-Audio format (which comes on a single disc). Actually, it contains TWO separate discs (DVD-Video + Audio-CD).<br /><br />Rafi Pinales.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult never ceases to amaze. She's written yet another amazing novel. A page turner, definitely, a tear jerker, absolutely, and not a book you'll want to put down until the very last page.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I love this game in real life. But the app leaves a lot to be desired. For example It often freezes while trying to play pieces and gets hung up when you are moving pieces around. And it doesn't automatically go to start a new game once the game is over.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Love this book.  My personal favorite.  Great read, awesome scares, and it truly works your imagination.  Truly hope he doesn't write a follow up because the ending is so gratifying.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Cool graphics, easy to learn, . I like it so far no hang up yet, will update if any occurs It is a free game..
B000085RPU|2.0|I can't watch it, it doesn't play...<br />It Says &#34;Wrong disc region&#34;...<br />I guess I purchased the wrong disc format...
B00338QENI|4.0|I felt like I was there in the cotton fields. Seems only right that the mistreatment of blacks especially in health and mental health care is exposed again, this time in a non-fiction  format. Excellent book!
0385493622|5.0|Fermat's Last Theorem is the greatest riddle ever challenged by mathematicians spanning different centuries and different concepts and that's how this book is all about. Fermat's Enigma is truly one of the most dramatic reading where various mathematicians in real life are on a quest to solve the world's greatest mathematical problem where n represents 3, 4, 5...no solution. It has been quite as dramatic as reading a best-selling cult classic novel you all heard about but more importantly, it has given me several purposes that mathematicians tried and tried until they succeed in solving the greatest math problem we know as Fermat's Last Enigma. Of course, there has been some downfall faced by mathematicians, especially the men behind the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, but this book I read is all drama without the fuss and thanks to such wondrous sources, I am more than welcomed to recommend reading this fascinating book to almost everyone who has a deep interests in mathematics. Solving Fermat's Last Theorem literally holds a very special place in the history mathematics and no matter how many mathematicians sacrificed themselves to solve this problem, only one had triumphantly solved it with the help of his trusted people in his life. Students, like us, are truly fascinated about what sort of mysteries lurking around the history of mathematics but this Fermat's Last Theorem we all read about in this book really hits the spot, literally.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I couldn't finish the book, it was a tired shallow stream of consciousness. And no I have never tasted my monthly.
193700788X|1.0|I wondered how CH could write a more pathetic book than 11 and 12. but she pulled herself together for this best effort and delivered us a great steaming pile of codswallop.  The writing itself is high school juvenile, and not by an honor roll student.  Her characters undergo a metamorphosis into something new and strange.  Eric, poor Eric. Eric, I hardly knew ye.  The religious moralizing is a constant irritant.  I wasn't surprised that Sookie ended up with Sam.  CH became all about maternity, and Sam was the obvious one who could fertilze Sookie's aging ovums.  The accumulating numbers of women in the later books that became pregnant pretty much spells out Sookie's fate there.  As Gran risked everything for pregnancy, it seemed clear that Sookie would follow that path.  Sookie turned into a bore.  A bigoted, whining bore.  As other reviewers have stated, if I could give this book a minus 10 stars, I certainly would.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is an awesome follow-up of The Hunger Games. Filled with adventure. Even more addicting to read than the first book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive I try to stop playing and pick my tablet back up and start again, it gives hours of long lasting fun.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This movie is fast, action-packed. The ending is not expected. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Terrific
B002GSC1KG|5.0|I don't know how I managed to miss this movie for so long, but it is now tied with Heat as my favorite Pacino movie.
B0083GQVOC|4.0|Not a surprise that there's a bad seed in this family. The intense family dynamics keeps you on the edge of your seat; sometimes. Other times you virtually know what's going to happen next. The price makes this movie worth viewing. Adults only!
B001PB3NWK|5.0|This DVD is best used to describe the Pope's life and strugglesand love towards mankind ! Great movie!!<br />Nadia E.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I think this photo editor is good. It helped me make covers for my books ,like adding in text for the title I like making photos black and white and all the other changes I can do with it . I don't have a problem with this editor so I don't know if the Tech help is any good or not. Works well on my kindle HD
1465001107|5.0|I get a new one every year. These are great pics and make great keepsakes just for the pics alone
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't always enjoy post apocalyptic books but the author creates a realistic and believable world within the silo. The characters are believable and easy to relate to. I enjoyed that the characters were not caricatured but had positive and negative characteristics. The plot kept me entertained and curious to read the next post of the series.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Have been watching this series for decades.  Periodically changing cast members seems to help with keeping the story lines fresh.<br />However, there was a lot of &#34;re-visiting&#34; with older nemesis this season; the Daleks are campy and will probably never go away.  That's O.K. Captain Jack is a frequent visitor, but his character has too many flaws for my tastes.  The local PBS station dropped the program a number of years ago. Our satellite provider removed this series from several channels where is used to be available.  They charge a premium a premium for BBC, so it is great to be able to watch the series on Amazon.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I liked how descriptive the book was... Cassandra Clare is an outstanding author.  I would recommend this book to people who like action packed cliffhangers.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Short review - I enjoyed season 1, however I felt that several episodes were a bit cheesy.  Worth watching if you're looking for a fun-upbeat crime drama.
B0089MXRII|3.0|Julia Gousseva does a pretty good job of describing a year's worth of events in a child's life in the Soviet Union--I particularly enjoyed her description of all the neighbors in an apartment building banding together to avoid mass eviction while major repairs are made--but her narratives never go anywhere. I'm grateful to her for preserving some of the objects and experiences of Soviet culture, but her stories have no grit. They're flat.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Sometimes I just need to read how survivors of child abuse rise to be the best versions of themselves.  This was a very heartwarming book of two such survivors.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|My complaint is they didn't have David sing Hawaii on the cd, as he did in concert.  Instead he sings Getcha Back, a song he originally never even appeared on, and it has no Brian & Mike lead vocals.  David deserves better, he helped to create this music, and was with them as a full time member from 1962-1963, and again from 1997-1999, and has also helped them out whenever Carl wasn't available during the \\"lost\\" years, and kept himself quite active with the 5 different bands featuring original Beach Boys members, even during time of illness, during the 15 years before the reunion tour.  Otherwise, the harmonies are great, although I still think they could do it without The Brian Wilson Band doing background vocals.
B007R21JJK|4.0|I think this is a good Motherboard, but no the best.<br /><br />I was not able to overclock the CPU, and it looks like the 2 cards are making the PCH overheat.<br />Current temperature (32 (CPU), 55 (PCH), 40 (System)) and cards are on 40.<br />I'm going to upgrade my case to one with better air flow, play aroung with the fans and see if this improve the tempetures,<br />I don't think is a PSU problem<br /><br />PS: now the PCH temp down to 55, after moving some cables and Improving the air flow, but still it's high
B008V8FVTI|4.0|I recall seeing this some years ago but watched it again recently. It's a horrible story that opens our eyes to the nightmare(s) that can easily go on in correctional facilities w/o anyone monitoring the higher ups. It's based on a true story although no institution or court will attest to the fact that this was a real case. Beware, the movies some very disturbing scenes that will stay with you, probably for a lifetime. Well worth the watch for the excellent acting (by both generations of boys) and the story itself.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is the first collector card game I've played that actually requires a bit of strategy.  Great looking cards and fun gameplay.  Haven't gotten very far yet, but I'm enjoying it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game because ypu get to be Ironman and you can unlock more suits and most of all, SAVE THE WORLD!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, all three times that I read it. I haven't read it in a couple of weeks, but I still think about the book and really wish there was more.
0767821769|5.0|The movie is great and was a total tear jerker I have to admit. Your services were great and right on time. I really enjoy this movie and I hope to do more shopping on Amazon in the future. Thank you ever much
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|It needed discipline to put it down. Addictive. The story takes over. When is the next follow up to appear?
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Branagh has brilliantly directed and acted Hamlet in this production. The costumes, set, and lighting are rich in detail and symbolism. There are touches of red color that grow into draping, dripping blood red in the players scene. The acting style has a heightened reality that gives the action of the play great power.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is really cool game. When you start playing you do not want to stop, thats how fun it is!!!
B00CRS5HII|5.0|This CD is truly fantastic!!!  Darius is at his best on this CD...this CD is just full of deep songs which really make you feel...the track with Sheryl Crow is my personal favorite but I truly love this CD.
B000B5IPDI|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever, and the whole family can watch it without worry...although the story wonders, it is coherent and well written so that even my 5 year old gets it, but Mom and me enjoy it too. One of the best cast gatherings ever and everyone fits their part perfectly.<br /><br />I recieved this movie in a timely manner and it met or exceded all expectations.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I have always wanted a calculator like this. Simple and easy to use. This will work for many things I am doing around the house. Has been great for many uses and should work great for many more.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|I loved this movie growing up, and I still do. While it may be a little corny by todays stanard, when it came out it was modern and edgy. Also, the underground water scenes, as well as the fountain scenes toward the end, were filmed in my home town...Fort Worth, Texas, at the Fort Worth Water Gardens!!!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another great book by Lee Child.  You can't go wrong with Lee or Jack Reacher.  I will be getting the next one soon.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I saw that slot of people bought this app. So I went for it ,and I have no clue as to what I was supposed to do.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|love this super hero series. lots of surprising thing that come up. you think you have it figured out and BAM, you had no clue !!! hope this series continues. love the the star of the show and his guard that works with him. i guess guard is the wrong term. think if you love super hero's GET THIS YOU WON'T BE SORRY !!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a huge fan of puzzles, and am constantly disappointed by petty attempts at escape games. This game hit the nail on the head. Tons of tough puzzles, some took a lot of searching to figure out. Overall the best escape game I've  ever seen. Cant wait to see what's next!
B009AMANBA|1.0|I can't believe this movie won an academy award. The entire movie is boring, the set is dark and the sound is terrible. And it is so historically inaccurate! Just glad I rented it and did not buy it.
1400052181|1.0|Her cells were taken without permission so anything done with them is illegal.<br />Anyone who used them should be proscuted and sent to jail.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Be prepare to be sucked in by Giddeon again! One of the best books I've ever read, and believe it or not, better than 50 shades. Can't wait until June 4th for the next chapter in Giddeon and Eva's life together!!
B0057UD49M|5.0|This is a great graphic novel.  It is very well crafted and moving.  The complexity of the characters and their many conflicts are explored gracefully and insightfully.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|reads more like reality than media accounts...filled with pride for our military I recomend this to anyone interested in Seal action.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|good game play impressive for an app.  a little hard to progress without spending real money but thats all apps these days
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|The movie helped me understand some of the political posture of America during the Civil War. If you are a Civil War studdent, it may be helpful for you; if you are looking for blood and guts, there are only a few scenes with carnage (that's a plus). This is not one of Sally Fields' best movies, but Daniel Day-Lewis reveals the passion Lincoln had for a &#34;UNITED States&#34; quite well.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|This has so many twists and turns it keeps you hooked. I love watching on amazon. No commercials. And you can watch then anytime.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting for Hill Climb to be available for my Kindle since I got it on my iPhone. I love this game. It's addicting. This is from someone that is not a gamer.  Highly recommended!
B00CL68NOG|2.0|It was very boring causing my wife and I to fall asleep.  We tried to watch it the next day and it was too slow moving with boring acting causing us to turn it off.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this, it rotects and keeps my kindle safe if its dropped on accident. Thank you so very much!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Very good story line but was a little slow moving to build each character.  I wonder if the book is better.  It could have been a much better movie but the acting was very predictable.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|It had some pretty good stories but...<br /><br /> (spoilers)<br /><br />It was kinda a cock tease to have the whole season build to banishing demons, then not because they don't want Sam to die. They could have easily brought him back, it's not like they haven't done it 6 or 7 times before
B007JMW46U|5.0|The illustrations were wonderful. The book never fails to entertain, always and forever a treasured classic. Truly one of my favorites.
B00821OX98|4.0|The series has potential for staying around since it has a good story line and well developed characters. Just enough love and family to make it interesting but not take away from the main theme. Aliens are excellent. Like the attached robot creator...
B004DNWPY4|5.0|I've read this book many times, and go back to it every few years.  There are so many interesting points, and I feel like I get to see what I'm doing right, and wrong. The statistic shown are fascinating.<br />.<br />After re-reading this book, I anyways feel like I just had a great financial tune up!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I found this movie entertaining but predictable. Paul Rudd is very good in his role as the good, idealistic husband.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was fascinating and I hope he is right. A comfortable view of the Afterlife. Being a neurosurgeon Dr. Alexander must have  insight into this happening.
B0061P2L5U|4.0|I have not finished this important book yet and may be therefore unqualified to comment now. Yet I feel compelled to say I believe this author is onto a topic little studied by mainstream Medicine that may, if treated with the respect and care I believe it deserves, become a source of multiple cures to modern maladies. For those wondering about mysterious illnesses such as lupus, allergies that won't go away, metabolic syndrome, and a host of other autoimmune diseases cropping up all over the advanced Western societies this book is a must. Perhaps it doesn't answer the questions posed by tis sudden outbreak, but it I'm convinced , raises the right questions and poses a challenge to science to help us all with better answers.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book and playing with the exercises. I feel this is a good way to realize the energy around you at work.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|this movie is 3 hours long and very confusing. Lots of great actors lots of good shots but very confusing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing style grabbed me and sucked me in. The characters were engaging and intelligent. Hugh howey should be paid the big bucks. And I want a movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|a look back at the tremendous change in society at that time.  This series is extemely well cast full of very different characters with a good balance of drama, romance and history
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie. The political maneuvering that went into emancipation was amazing. Lincoln's ability to get people to do what he wanted them to do shows his genius. Daniel Day-Lewis did a remarkable job. The entire cast was excellent. A great movie and a significant addition to our culture.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|This is a likeable CD with many old standards and a couple of new songs. I find the mastering of this particular CD to be uninspired. There seems to be an overemphasis of the bass which tends to muddy the low end and the mid range as well, sort of typical of the philosophy that CDs are an obsolete format, undeserving of the kind of quality mastering that is available today. Probably much better in the HD rez versions, but of course more expensive as well.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great for passing time! I am addicted to this game. It is good for challenging my speed. Can't wait to learn all of the rules.
0316069884|3.0|Was not exactly what I thought it was going to be about.  I thouht there would be more information about how meat affects our bodies.  It delt mostly with how animals are being raised and treated in farm factories. Which is very disstressing in itself.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Best Kept Secret is the third book in this Archer series. Like the other two books in the series, it's almost impossible to put down.<br />Written very well.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|THIS IS THE SECOND MOVIE I HAVE DEALING WITH THE NEGRO CONTRIBUTIONS TO  WWII AND ITS DONE IN A WELL THOUGHT OUT RENDERING.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It had its moments but was otherwise boring. To predictable at times. Nothing like the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS A VERY GOOD ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK WHICH STARTED THE LORD OF THE RINGS BOOKS AND MOVIES.
B00AL3OD7C|5.0|Used to have this on vinyl and cassette. Very happy to find it on digital format! Best Rush album ever!!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I enjoyed this book!<br />The voice was clever and unique and will likely be copied by other authors. Other reviewers have already provided a good summary of the book so I will only touch on what I liked/didn't like.<br /><br />Liked:<br />1. Uniqueness of approach/voice<br />2. Silly moments- I didn't laugh out loud but I definitely smirked at least twice<br />3. Drew's voice was very masculine. Props to this author for pulling it off!<br />4. Kate was likeable and smart<br />5. The story was character driven, not plot driven.<br /><br />Didn't like:<br />1. Drew was really hard to like- even at the end. I found it unbelievable that he would have changed so dramatically so quickly.  He was almost TOO male, became somewhat of a cartoon character. I couldn't root for him.<br />2. Kate- although likeable and smart- lacked... something. Maybe flaws? Maybe she was just too perfect? She was too nice, too smart, too mature... she was boring, especially in comparison to Drew's over the top personality.<br />3. The story felt rushed towards the end.<br /><br />Overall- if I constantly reminded myself to suspend disbelief- it was a fun read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham's stories have become just good enough to keep you pressing through to the end. I was skimming through too many pages though. 3 stars tops.
0062082353|5.0|Purchased for father's day for my retired military husband.  He loved it!  Especially glad we purchased considering the terrible<br />ending that came to the author.  He was a very special individual, devoted to the protection of this great country!
B009MYARIK|3.0|Cute & readable. A little too much fluff & ridiculous situations, but an easy read. You don't have to think too much on this one.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|I almost completely missed this series on its run on TV, so it is a real treat to watch it from the beginning... love the weekend marathons.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I knew nothing about Captain America before this movie, other than he was a super soldier.  Once again, Marvel did an awesome job of bringing a comic book hero to life, complete with a villain who was more than a match for him.  This movie was the prelude to The Avengers, and showed that Marvel knew what they were doing.
0446581356|4.0|This book is straight forward, has great visual aids and is easy to read. I would recommend to someone who wants to learn new make up techniques.
B008602KQI|1.0|The acting was great, in the cinematography was wonderful. But the premise and plot storyline and outcome of the movie was not something that I would want to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so amazing!!!! It is way better than the first app,and the graphics are fantastic!!*** My little sister plays the app like every single day.
B0093ST02E|1.0|I didn't like this movie for all the foul language that was in it. I didn't watch all of it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Awesome with a bad*ss intro is really all I have to say other than that the small fact that there are classes and I'm not just thrown in there as a big guy with a claymore is fun.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This record's too cool - He continues to grow and get better.  Always a surprise and never dissapoints.  Loved this album.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I usually have a hard time getting into Stephen King books, just because they are so long.  I had a hard time putting this one down, however.
B00821OX98|5.0|Really interesting, well-written sci-fi series about the invasion of aliens and human resistance to it.  If you are into sci-fi, and particularly military themes, you'll love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Yes, Hopeless was about high school teenagers but had a great suspense. I could not put this book down. It's a good romance book and didn't drag. After reading this book, I am going to start reading more of Colleen Hoover books. This book reminds me of a lifetime movie.
B00795P4EG|4.0|This is a cool app. but sometimes doesn't work quite right.  Fun to play with though, especially the duplicate stamp.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This reminds me of my childhood so much. This is an amazing album. If you are on the fence, just go with your gut and pick it up right now!
B0053JJLLC|1.0|This is not classic Crichton by any means. The introduction says that Crichton was &#34;well into writing&#34; Micro. My guess is it means a rough outline because this is not the quality Crichton fans are accustomed to.
B000SW16M6|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in 1982.  Who knew that so early in the decade, the creators of this film had totally summarized the cynicism and greed of the 1980s, and had also come up with iconic imagery-- the Wayfarers, the underwear dance, plus the soundtrack-- that would be so much a part of pop culture.<br /><br />I am NOT a fan of Tom Cruise-- most of his subsequent movies have showcased a self-absorbed, tense, control freak performer-- but here he's wonderful.  The other actors are also superb, with the exception of the wooden Rebeccca de Mornay, who would eventually develop into an adequate actress then disappear.  The parents are genius, as are the three best friends.<br /><br />This 25th anniversary edition has some decent commentary, plus the famous &#34;original&#34; ending that the studios wanted replaced.  The director should thank them.  What was framed as a &#34;happy&#34; ending is what gives the film a point of view-- that there is no punishment for amorality.  The director's preferred ending is weaker.  The notion that somehow Joel and the hooker have a romantic future together is at odds with the cynicism of the film.
B00CW665VI|5.0|A really great read. Hilarious and witty. This book keeps you begging for more. I could not help but wish for Drew to take the fall and Kate was just the Woman to bring him to his knees. Buy it or else.
0385349831|3.0|Against the backdrop of the invasion of Jerusalelm, and adressing a frightened crowd of predominently Jews and Moslems,a wise man of the times delivers a a faith based allegory with philosophical overtones in his offer of guidance through life.  His answers to secular questions is like a series of Sunday morning sermons that often moves beyond reality and into the metaphysical arena. An earlier review of the book summerized the principles offered in each chapter and could afford potential readers of the abreviated novel a short cut to its promised delivery.  Those expecting a story built around the event will be disappointed.  Too bad the writer did not weave a more interesting tail before introducing the programed scripture like answers.  If the questioners were profiled and a develpmental background offered on their lives that propelled them to seek answers to lifes continuing problems the book would be much more enjoyable.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|I'm a huge Bond fan and World War 2 buff, so in many ways this was a perfect book for me. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. Damian Stevenson has written a meticulously detailed historical novel with a twist - he has used a pop culture icon as his protagonist. Somehow he manages to pull it off. It's Bond versus Nazis!! The story reads like a Bond book, but is gritty and realistic. Even if you are not a 007 buff this is a total page turner for anyone who likes to get lost in a magical story. Stevenson's descriptions of time and place are vivid and compelling. I loved all the Nazis and French Resistance characters and the women are all smart, sexy and not to be messed with! In many ways, this reads a lot like a movie but an intelligent, thoughtful piece of entertainment. Perhaps `The Fleming Files' will be a parallel franchise to the incredibly successful one that Ian Fleming himself created in 1953 with the publication of `Casino Royale.'
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great! It tells you how much time you have on your device and how much time you have on apps with your device. It does not SAVE your battery completely though.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|From the starting notes of the very first song I knew I was in for a treat. There is something about the overall sound of The National that calls to me in a comfortable way. Sort of like slipping into your favorite easy chair. Unlike most listeners, I don't pay that much attention to the words in the songs. As such I perhaps miss out on important aspects of a group's \\"meaning\\". So be it. I hear vocals as an instrument that are a component of something larger.<br /><br />The National is a wind that blows gently through a garden creating a moving texture seen as the plants and bushes take their turn waving. Or a sudden flow of water creating a new path across the landscape. They affect me in a very emotional way. A feeling or awareness of something so beautiful that I feel my eyes start to tear up. There is something special here in this music and I am grateful to be able to experience it.
B001KZG99A|4.0|great adventure, sci-fi slick - add to your Iron Man collection and be sure to get Iron Man 3 when it is available
B00CATSONE|3.0|The book's focus is not on Tesla, but on what makes a genius.  If you are looking for a pure biography, this isn't it.  However, it did provide me with information about the gentleman that I didn't have before; for example, Edison's treatment of Tesla.  It is a quick read though.  It isn't very long.  If you don't like the psychobabble you can always skip it and read the biography pages.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|Daft Punk, you're kidding right? I've been waiting for years to hear the original, electronic, quirky and bubbly dance music that Daft Punk has successfully released in the global stratosphere of planet Earth. You've channeled our inner dancing kings and queens with daring musical choices that are truly greater than the sum of the parts. What happened? Each song sounds like a continuation of the last. Every sound is so similar to each other that I feel jipped of my creative indulgence time with your music. My mind, and my senses, are bored. What was your inspiration? Profits?<br />I'm going to wait for the actual material that you all spent years constructing to be respectfully released. Not the revised, edited and filtered content we hear on this version of your new album. What a shame.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Read this book! Then get on your knees and thank the good Lord for all the ultimate sacrifice that countless American servicemen and women have given for this country. Thank you  Marcus, for  your service.
0670024813|3.0|My introduction to Mr. Diamond, like many others I would suspect, came in college with Guns, Germs, and Steele.  I have great respect for him and the impact that his work as had on various fields in social sciences. The research in The World Until Yesterday was presented in a very readable manner, and most of the topics selected were interesting.  Unfortunately, this book fails to provide an objective approach.  What Mr. Diamond failed to recognize and accurately identify was his own subjectivity in approaching the topics, specifically elder care, he addressed.<br /><br />Throughout the book Mr. Diamond glosses over treatment of women in traditional societies, often characterizing them as property in the cultures he researched.  Having lived abroad for most of my adult life in various countries, and having interacted with a good number of traditional societies, such a broad brush approach is inaccurate.  As roughly fifty percent of any given society are female, logically such a book would do well to devote a chapter to this topic.<br /><br />Topics such as chid rearing and elder care were instead selected by Mr. Diamond for comparison between traditional and modern societies.  Mr. Diamond is both a father and an individual verging on what could be called \\"elderly\\" by Western standards. That's all well and good.  Yet elders are by composition less than half of most societies and for much of this chapter, Mr. Diamond appears to hop on a soapbox and lament Western Society's treatment elders, giving the reader the impression that he is personally worried about his future treatment as an elder.  In the process - for this reader - he lost his lens of objectivity.<br /><br />Overall, however, The World Until Yesterday is worth a read.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|You gotta love when all the movies start to seem the same and then they come along with something like Django which completely breaks the mold. Great movie I can watch over and over.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|Fast & Furious 6 is not the best of the series. The acting and writing is still top notch but after six films there's not a lot of surprises left. We've seen Vin Diesel and that other guy go through a lot together and we've seen them grow from plucky young speedsters to delightful young men who still enjoy driving a little bit faster than others, but I think time to bring the series to a close.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Excellent book! Currently unemployed, I need to deep six the gym membership. My tri coach recommended. I am looking forward to a new and effective way to boost strength and fitness through Convict Conditioning!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|this exqusite book is simply an amazing tale about the struggle to remain human in the face of immense misfortuane.<br />sorry.... im going to talk aout the end so dont read if you dont want it to be spoiled<br />most of the story seems like a fantastical adventure about a boy vs nature, but in reality (as revealed at the end) its a struggle of a man vs himself. pi has to deal with the animal inside as all humanity is lost in the lonely horror he suffers at sea. he faces awful choices and becomes the terrible tiger he once feared.<br /> pi is richard parker.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|What an awesome tale! It is whimsical, fantastic and ties together well. Well written and highly amusing read. Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this thriller! I did not like the ending, but it was a great book. I did not want it to end!
B0042UEU8M|3.0|Kinda cheesey...I only purchased because I was looking for an inexpensive movie that I could download and watch on a plane. It is something I would have watched for free on Netflix, but not worth the 2.99
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|And in the end<br />The love you take<br />Is equal to the love you make......<br />4 main characters go round and round.......in time.
B006LXQID8|5.0|The best part of this movie is the awesome way in which it is told. Quick-paced, narrator-driven, and fanciful. The lead actress is perfectly cast and the story is sad, happy, and thought-provoking all at the same time. I was watching this on a plane and was a little embarrassed when it unexpectedly cut to some graphic sex scenes. I don't think the dude next to me minded, but a warning to not watch this in public. :)
B009CF7GRY|3.0|it was pretty good I love music and ok country boy in overalls was awesome... you have to at least watch it one time
B001EBWIRW|5.0|Love the songs, love Rick Morranis, love the story. Absolutely a favorite from my childhood that is just as awesome now. Can't watch it without singing along! :)

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I didn't see it at the movie theater, but when it won an award I decided I would eventually watch it.  I thought it was going to fall in the chick flick genre. Not so...I guess I should pay more attention to story lines.  The acting is outstanding. Simply outstanding.  enough said.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's addicting. I bought it for my son but I'm the one who plays it. It's relaxing to me and its easy to play.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though we knew the outcome while watching this movie, it was still a nail-biter.  The characters and the film shots, settings...everything was incredible.  No detail too small to be considered and well chosen. What a great movie should be.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a well written mystery tale. Don't let anyone give away the plot. I must now start reading other works by William Landay.

1416549447|5.0|This book was what I expected and came in the time frame you said it would.  I'm satisfied and began using it as soon as I got it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|if you liked the movie you will absolutely love the book, It goes into way more detail than the movie. I totally recommend this book.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|If this were a fictional story, you would think it was far-fetched. I saw the film first, which I can now say is very true to the book. I found the film painful to watch, as I could not help empathizing with Joe. I feared the book would be worse, since I would be inside his head, but somehow it was not. He does describe all of the hardships, especially the emotional hardships, but in a matter of fact way that somehow was not painful for me.
0553347845|5.0|I love reading about Richard Feynman and in particular this book showed his human side.  How he dealt with death and how he dealt with the NASA and governmental bureaucracy.  It clearly shows how our large systems are not able to respond to correct and new ideas because, &#34;This is the way we've always done it&#34; attitude.
1400069807|5.0|These additives used in production effect the consumer in terms of cost,convience, and flavor.  Health professionals and consumers need to realize there is no simple solution to the nutritional crises we have some sort of balance must be achieved to realize our overall objective
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love ASOIAF, it is so complex and exciting. ADWD  rates a little lower than the others mainly because I felt frustrated at the slower pace compared to the others. It seemed like it was all building up to something and ended before there was any satisfying conclusion. I am going to re read the series and combine ADWD and AFWC using chapter guides that have been put together to to follow the timeline more closely. Who knows, it may end up being my favorite after a while.
B00A2YBDTQ|2.0|the movie is a satire on Star Wars but not nearly as funny 0r satirical as some of Brooks' earlier works

B0094LY88G|5.0|Glad I finally saw this one. I was hoping it would be a free Prime instant video, but def worth price of admission. Now-- someone PLEASE tell me why \\"Mud\\", a great movie on so many levels, is not yet in wide release.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great story line.  Kinda wish they would do a little more with the back story of the invasion. But those might come in later seasons.  Cant wait to get through season two
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay, this has got to be one of the best books I've ever read. Drew is hilarious!! I loved hearing the story from his point of view, as well as his views on life as he's telling us the story. I fell in love with him instantly! I wanted he and Kate to get their happy every after. I wanted him to convince Kate they were forever. I just wanted him to get everything he wants.<br /><br />You will love his friends and co-workers. His sister is great. His niece is an angel and she a bad word jar she carries around that makes her a very rich preschooler. :) Even his secretary is awesome. I couldn't find one single thing wrong with this book. You'll love the Thanksgiving dinner with his parents ...too funny.<br /><br />When Drew decides he's going to fight to win Kate, the things he does are so sweet and romantic. Just read the book!!!! I'm so glad that I did, and since it's a series, I can't wait to find out who the next book with be based on, and can't wait to get it.

0425252868|5.0|World War II books continue to amaze and inform and inspire almost 70 years after the end of global hostilities.  Personal stories of heroism, courage, caring, honor (often between enemies) -- all continue to surface to be told as time passes.  Recent books that tell powerful stories have included \\"Ghost Soldiers\\" (Hampton Sides) \\"The Wild Blue\\" (Steven Ambrose), \\"Fly Boys\\" and \\"With Wings Like Eagles\\" (Michael Korda).<br /><br />These are all great reads that take you to the chaos of the battlefield or put you there in the fighters or bombers.  And in this genre is a powerful book by Adam Makos with Larry Alexander - \\"A Higher Call.\\"  The subtitle is...\\"an incredible true story of combat and chivarly...\\" And so it is.<br /><br />This is remarkable book that tales the story of an American B-17 bomber crew, their craft terribly shot up over Germany, with dead and wounded on board, and a lone German fighter pilot hotly in pursuit for the easy kill.  But then something happens over the short course of 10 minutes that changes the fate of all of the men's lives that day in December 1944...saving them from certain death (as it turns out, for all) so they could go on to have long, productive postwar lives for the survivors.<br /><br />As I read the book I found myself thinking about fate and the role of fate (or luck, bad and good) in life-and-death wartime struggles.  \\"A Higher Call\\" is what I think this was all about. Certain men were to die on the bombing runs over Germany. (There were 15,000 B-17s built; 5,000 were destroyed, with 10-men crews in each -- 50,000 young, volunteer Americans in the planes, many were killed, captured, or wounded.) Some were to live to fight another day. Or to survive the war and return home, many never to fly again.<br /><br />But this story or the stories of the bomber-fighter encounter participants do not end with WW II.  The 10-minute encounter in the skies lived on in vivid (and often haunting) memory of those involved that day.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Best and most addictive game I've played in ages. It's fun and thrilling and collecting trophies keep me playing all day AND night
B009KEN87O|4.0|Reminds me of blowing a roll of quarters on Galaxians back in my college days. But now it's free and you can do it while sitting in the &#34;executive reading room&#34; at work! Has a great simple control system that I hope more games will be inspired to follow.
1451695195|5.0|AWESOME SELLER THANKS SO MUCH & SUCH A GREAT BOOK EVERYBODY I HAVE GIVEN IT TO HAVE JUST LOVED IT SO IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT PLEASE DO YOUR LIFE WILL BE FOREVER CHANGED.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I didn't expect to like this. Cute movie... very entertaining for both my 10 yr old grandchild and me! Thank you Amazon Prime!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Amazing game! Just as entertaining as Cut the Rope, but free! This game is a total must have. Highly recommended for all ages.
B004SDEP38|1.0|This won't accept documents from Apple's &#34;pages&#34; and thus was worthless to us. Overall I am disappointed with the fire having brought a bunch of other Kindles which we love and use.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|great story , got to love them ,  altimate bad dudes , fearless always great to watch and wonder if you are one or where
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked on Ms Collins delivery of the story through Catniss' eyes. She was pretty hip as a teenager. I constantly see parallels to our society and the way the Capitol operated... almost scary to see the similarities when watching the news and media today.<br />The book is just as exciting as the first 2.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It has been a very long time since I have enjoyed a game on my android... I just keep coming back for more!
B008Y79IUE|4.0|Very gritty, intense, dark side of drug use.Jennifer Connoly and Ellen Burstyn are fantastic.  Great special effects.  Excellent sound track.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I bought this app on my kindle and the graphics are a little bit low but that's fine by me. The problem is that it is buggy and glitchy that's the problem.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is fun, fast and never dull.  I think it helps keep your mind sharp by playing this. I like it.
B000002UWF|5.0|Great Cd,listening to this is a real treat.David Lee Roth copied every single breath Louis took in his cover of Just a Giglio,and Ms Smith is a singer beyond compare,her backup and duets make this a keeper.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I have really enjoyed the whole Dr. Who series since it started this new series of seasons and have actually watched all of the seasons available on DVD up to almost the present.  In spite of this I need a little diversion and I found that rewatching this video was the best alternative at the time.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|This movie without a doubt was the worst effort of tom hank's he's ever done.  I don't understand how he could involve<br />himeself in it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another Pendergast adventure with twists and turns and surprise interjections.  This time he is involved with a story line taken right out of the tales of Dr. Mengala.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|John Mayer is a really good musician and in this concert he plays very well, not only the most famous melodic songs ;but really nice blues songs too, with awesome guitar solos.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|While I feel that the usb cable should have been included with the purchae of the Kindle Fire last June, customer service was quite helpful in getting me one.
B001LM1456|5.0|This movie is outstanding, it is outstanding for the comic book fan.  To dissect the movie from a modern platform is a disservice, for comic books are not every day life as we know it. Never was, never will be.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed this cord for my Kindle Fire ASAP and Amazon lived upto theY end of the deal. I received it the next day b/4 I'd had to go out of town. Great Job!
B0013WI0PQ|4.0|Love the actors and the drama and the music. It touched my soul! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves music!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not up too his usual standards.  The story line is pretty implausible, more so than usual.  Good, but not a great read.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|An absolutely divisive film, and one that has its own set of vocal detractors, but I'm afraid the negative reviewers are missing the forest for the trees. Thematically excellent and technically perfect, I found the filmmaking simply astounding and the emotional journey piercingly affective even after the 10th viewing.<br /><br />At the very least, if you can have an open mind, see it for yourself.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I had the same problem as others, with the game freezing up even after uninstalling and reinstalling, even deleting from the cloud and downloading.  But rebooting my kindle by holding down the power button did the trick.<br /><br />Really fun, challenging game.  Real happy with this as the free app of day, but it is better than apps I paid for.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|Story line was predictable<br />Characters were 1 dimensional<br />Did not enjoy this movie at all<br />Would not recommend paying for this one
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game it is not a challenge though and I hope a lot of people like it alot.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've always liked Big Fish games, so tried tis one, and as usual was not disappointed. Bring on #2!!! I'm ready for more HOG'S....
1423140591|5.0|I order books as gifts for students--reluctant readers.  I discover their interest, and we read aloud, taking turns.  I find books that have a sequel or are in a series.  The kids love the gift books and prefer hard cover.
B007THA4FI|2.0|My book club read this. I never finished it.  Just too complicated for someone who doesn't have a lot of time at one sitting to read.  With only short opportunities to read I found I had to keep rereading where I left off to get back into it. I made very little progress this way and eventually gave up.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|My daughter talked me into buy this Trilogy. At first I was in shock, then as I kept reading I discovered that there was a plot and I really enjoyed reading this.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another excellent Connelly book! The form says I have to write more words before I can submit this review.  That would cause most people to blow off reviewing the book, as it almost did me.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Like the other Terminator's , films, they are full of action and and what might happen if the MACHINES take ove.<br />  Thanks,  Bobbie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!! i mean regular minecraft is better but if you want to start out then its perfect. you have survival where zombies, creepers(wich blow up) , skeleton archers, and spiders attack you at night.<br />creative, you can build anything with unlimetid resorces. its forever day and you cant fight any monsters.<br />I think its worth the 4.00 i used to buy it. (i got it at discount)  and ive played it each day so far. i love it alot. its one of my favorites! so i reccomend you buy this wonderful, awesome game!! i would if i hadent already bought it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a great series of films . It tells you just what might happen if a strange being , appears from another part of the Universe. It makes you think how lucky we are.<br />  Thanks Bobbie
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Absolutely superb movie. Watched it multiple times. Gripping suspense, great acting, and to think it was based on a true story.
B001FB55I0|5.0|This movie tells you what might happen in the near future. It is fulll of action and fighting. It is a very explose<br /> film.  Thanks Bobbie
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National has a clear sense of identity as a band,  and part of their success has to do with embracing that instead of self consciously morphing themselves to some real or imagined expectation from the outside. As a result, this album feels both familiar and new. Matt Berninger's lyrics display vulnerability, angst, and hope. The songs have layers of sounds and meanings. Don't judge this by the first casual listen. Play it through a few times and if you are like me, you will find that it has slowly captured you.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Read the book and recently saw the movie.  The movie mirrors the book pretty well.  The futuristic hairdos and costumes were a little overdone but overall, theme was good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game to pass the time and keep my mind active.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys solitaire.
B00CW665VI|1.0|He is constantly talking about other women he has slept with. The story starts out with him in a depression then spans back 4 months where one might think that the relationship between the hero and heroine starts but nope. He is getting a BJ and then goes home with twins after meeting her. He then continues to talk about all the women he hooks up with every week while lusting after the heroine. When they do get together, they share a WEEKEND together after working together for 4 months while he still sleeps around, then he talks bad about her on the phone on purpose so she can hear. It was terrible. There were some funny parts in the dialogue and I would not have minded the way he spoke if he was celibate from the start but to be that vulgar all the time and being a man whore while wanting another woman is ridiculous. Why was he so messed up when he caused them to not be together and when they only had 2 days together??? He was so proud that he went 12 days without sex before the heroine finally slept with him. How pathetic is that??? He even goes to have sex with a woman the night he finds out the heroine works with him because he was lusting after the heroine and wanted relief. Not to mention that after a business dinner, he goes home with another woman after having drinks with the heroine. He could not keep it in his pants and is VERY PROUD of that fact. I hated it!!! BELOW ZERO STARS IF I COULD!!!!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|very good!! this is probably the best head set i have ever got. I am very happy with it right now
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Great ending to #10. Excited for season 5 and a new doctor. I recommend this to anyone who loves scifi.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kept me guessing all through the book.. Loved the character development. Back and forth in time was an interesting approach
B009IUH1N2|3.0|It had limited instructions and was pretty basic.  2 dimensional graphics and only a few different actions.  It is addicting and fun.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great storyline lots of different elements to the show. They keep the love sorry part of it to a minimum( sorry ladies and girlie boys). I do wish the show started when the invasion first harmed instead of afterwards.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I love sci-fi almost as much as I love action films and this gives me both. It also adds enough love interest and comedy to keep the rest of my family happy. This story clearly lives everyone wanting more and leaves many different directions a second film can go. I think this storyline has at least 2 more good films left in it.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Pros: Visually Stunning<br />Cons: Acting was poor. Really, Hollie Berry and Tom Hanks?<br />Story was poor. I never really got the &#34;tie in&#34; between the stories.<br />Sound quality was bad, really, really bad. About half of the time, I couldn't understand what the actors were saying.
B000M53GM2|4.0|Must have for any James Bond fan. This is the debut of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. I believe Sean Connery is the best James Bond but the action sequences of the Brosnan era are far superior. Anytime an agent goes rogue the storyline seems more believable because the bad guy knows what the hero knows, the hero just has to do it better.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Read this book! The characters will accompany you throughout your day and you'll be rushing home to get back to read more!
B000RPCK1U|4.0|Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh made this a must have for me. Several unique action stunts in this film, especially on the motorcycle. Ms. Yeoh holds her own in the fight scenes and Joe Don Baker's comical pop ins makes you smile.<br />Classic story of a super rich villian promoting war so he can profit seems alittle played out.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Plot has enough twists and turns to keep you hooked. Recommend to anyone.  Great way to watch with no commercials.  Can watch series back to back.
B00CFITJKW|5.0|It a really good game but I would like if they add real airlines<br /><br />Rather than  that  I love this game
B000Y90VO2|4.0|One of Val Kilmer's very first movies. No cursing or vomiting or nudity. I would rate it PG, but pg was not around then.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I put off reading this book for a long time. However, after picking it up I couldn't put it down. This is an amazing book!!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Works as great as my old AMD Phenom II 965 black 1.4W, no noticeable difference other then price. Next time I clean my PC fans I'll know to be careful when removing CPU fan, as it also came out with the CPU, bending some of the prongs which after painstakingly trying to straiten blew my CHEAP 1100watt Cyberpower PSU. I'm extremely pleased after replacing with the Seasonic 1050 PSU which runs much cooler and has the fan facing up instead of sucking in dust from below.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse was purchased to replace my aging and failing Logitech. The software for this mouse alone makes it superior, let alone the fact that it has three times the programmable buttons. The customizability coupled with its price makes this mouse a champion.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The acting and story line is excellent.  The story progresses show after show and you really get with the characters.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It is a great game. It just sometimes freezes when I'm turning. Does this happen to any of you?<br />The graphics are awesome! It actually turns when I tell it to. All the other Temple Run games sometimes Don`t  turn when I ask it to.<br />You should get this amazing game!!
B000FC11A6|5.0|By the time my Kindle indicated that I was 40% of the way through the book, Neal Stephenson had already told at least two stories to completion, and the book was still expanding in scope! When I read his books, I'm always excited to see how he'll end up pulling the different threads together, and I'm never disappointed. He is the antithesis to the trite and hackneyed &#34;twists&#34; which we must so often suffer at the hands of less talented authors.<br /><br />Also, if you enjoy WWII history at all, this book has the additional quality of inspiring hours of Wikipedia research, partly to discover where the line between history and fiction is actually drawn. It's really impossible to tell.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|While the book and the story line are good they fall short of John Grisham's usual high standard of writing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm a sucker for love.  I was kept on my toes page after page on which direction the story was taking and where Katniss' life was going to end up.  I'm truly happy with the ending
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Carole King: incredibly talented songwriter with an amazing voice.  I have loved this album since the days of vinyl. It saw a lot of use and I know every perfect word to every perfect song.
B003O86FMW|4.0|My advice regarding this book would be to have the third book of the trilogy next to you when approaching the end.  Weird ending to a book by itself but within the trilogy it's perfect because its a seamless transition to the next.  You will kicking yourself in the end if not.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|This is an incredible piece of work. Be careful who you watch it with as the story touches on many aspects of &#34;real&#34; life. Great ending !!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was so great. It really sheds light on mental health issues. The movie that was based on the book was good but as always the book is always better
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|My husband and I just saw the movie in 3D at the big screen this week, and we both loved it! We normally don't try to see a movie in 3D, but this was the last showing of this movie at our theater, and I just had to see it. We found the structure of the movie to be true to the original story by L. Frank Baum, and the characters were enhanced from the books of Oz. I will watch this movie over and over, just like the original with Judy Garland.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Besides the first, I enjoyed this book because there was more action and conflict that came out to make a story line. Good read if anyone is interested in the well-known sex scenes everyone is talking about.
B002L3ARRU|4.0|Excellent Friday night movie with some Chinese take out! Implausible, but shows a very self confident teen beat a bumbling school principal and he helps couple of uptight kids loosen up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and all the downloadable versions available for offline use. This is one of my favorite Bible apps. It's great for personal Bible study and is also great to take to church :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never been so intrigued by a book, to the point where I would lose sleep just to read it, I've completed the trilogy , and hope for my sake this will not be the end ! I highly suggest it
B00542UMIY|4.0|It was fun to watch as a family. Nice movie, we will be looking for fun movies for family. Thank You.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My boys live this lego! Comes with a golden ninja and the Temple is super cool... It is a perfect Ninjago Lego for their collection
B004KPQK2S|4.0|This is a wonderful story of a remarkable horse and the woman who owned him, believed in him.  I knew the Triple Crown was the Crown Jewel of horse racing but I had not idea the winning of such was so rare.
B001BANK32|5.0|I'll bet you haven't. Read this then. And you will truly know the meaning of fear.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned this and \\"Ghost Story\\" by Peter Straub are the two best horror books of the 20th century. That is all you need to know.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick made a terrifying rendition of this novel as a movie. And the movie stands on its own. But the book is filled with so much more than could ever be captured in a movie. It's also not exactly the same plot, so you won't be bored (as if!).<br /><br />Stay the hell away from little twin girls, do not go into room 237, oh and...REDRUM!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|My mom wanted to see this for a long time and it was a nice Christmas gift. But for those who don't keep up with tech, dvds and probably even blue rays will die out and downloadable/streaming movies/tv shows will be the &#34;thing&#34;. My parent though prefer to older technology like most older people.<br />Movie itself was funny to me and my mom, but my father wasn't as impressed due to its &#34;slow&#34; pace.<br />I would recommend it to younger and middle aged crowd.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was a bit difficult to start but once you stay with it you begin to be involved in their lives.  I never figured out the relationship til almost the end.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|I've read that because this is a HD version it cannot be played on the first or second generation kindle fires. It actually can. I own more than one HD game and its just as clear as any other game. Now as far as the game goes: it's alright nothing great but not horrible. It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Not real useful on Kindle. Kindle has it's own native app that polls most major e-mail providers and that includes Yahoo mail. So, why would you want to use this on your Kindle Fire? I'm not sure... kind of redundant.
B0071FBARY|5.0|Bought it for my wife, but I love it too.  They have a great sound and have good variety as well.
B00122BEPA|3.0|Eddie, Sammy and David never sounded better. The bit rate is good and the reproduction is on par. If you're a Van Halen fan, you'll love this album.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Wish I would have had this in prior math classes, this calculator is fantastic!  Very simple design makes it easy to understand entering fractions and then it simply does the math for you!<br /><br />Maybe a Math class isn't the best way to use it since it takes away from REALLY learning how to do fractions, but in the real world, you need something like this!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Nice app and displays well, although it makes your Kindle Fire feel like a giant smartphone. If you've already got this on your smartphone, there's nothing new here that would compel you to use it on your Kindle Fire. It's okay, but nothing spectacular.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Show is very engaging and somehow draws you in to watch more after each episode. Acting is superb. Accuracy of that time period is impressive
B0057VY45O|5.0|Really enjoyed watching the pilot of this show. Definantly going to be going through and watching the entire season, only wish the second season was free on Amazon Prime as well...too many of my favorite shows are ending up with that same issue.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|The app looks interesting but I can't give an alarm clock app 5 stars that needs my exact (not just coarse) GPS location and full access to the internet, among other unexplained permissions.  Developer, please explain the need and I will increase my rating.  Otherwise we will have to assume that this is spyware.  Thank you!
B009R659L8|2.0|I used to read everything Ms Clark wrote--her memoir, her history of George Washington and certainly all her mysteries.  But the last few have been poorly written.  This book was unfortunately no exception.  I read about 50 pages and nothing of interest had happened and it d-r-a-g-g-e-d.  I put it down.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I've really enjoyed the show so far. It's been very intersting and entertaining . I'm looking forward to watching the rest if the season . It's been a fun take off from the comic book I grew up reading.
072325804X|5.0|My toddler and I love reading the tales and enjoying the beautiful illustrations. A quality book that I hope we will enjoy over and over.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a great read! It has romance and thrills all in one. Very much like a James Patterson novel. I will definitely be<br />looking for more of Ms. Hough's fantastic writings! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Why this wasn't Best Picture at the Oscars is a mystery to me. There is nothing less than excellent about it. Only thing I can figure is that folks didn't want to see something about an old historical figure.  Also, FYI, it is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals which is also very good
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|My husband and I both loved the movie.  It was an emotional ride but we thoroughly enjoyed and thought it well-acted.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Don't like that you have to have the APP open in order to record, why not just listen instead setting up a time to record
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a great movie. My daughter and I love it so much that it is our go-to movie when we want to watch something at home.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very accurate portrayal of the interplay of friends and family of those afflicted with mental illness, then the beauty of finding one that understands and can relate like few others. Inspirational both to those that have and have not taken the dark journey of mental illness.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|I'm glad this was free its a fun game to pass time with waiting for my next speeder...lol or just waiting on  time to go home.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't care what the women of the nation and world say about this book while fanning themselves over seeming hot flashes. The writing is absurdly poor, any high school essay is a higher writing level than this. Not to mention the content. BORING. Or rather, I feel badly for the people that are so turned on by or into the &#34;inside world of BDSM&#34;. They just have not had enough satisfying and explorational intimate relations to know this is tame at most.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am not really looking to get into the competitive aspect of bodybuilding, so I was looking for something that would give me the information as clearly and plainly as it can get.<br />And Mike's Bigger Leaner and Stronger was helpful in that sense.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to keep fit and look good but does not want to be bogged down with all the unnecessary details.<br />I am sure those who want to get into serious competitive style bodybuilding would benefit from this book too.<br />And the surprising part is that the author takes time to respond to questions that you might have regarding your plans.<br />Thanks Mike.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|Pretty fun game but there's a clear bump in difficulty that you make it over fairly early on. Runs seem very short in the beginning but after a few upgrades it seems to get easier fairly fast and from then on its just a grind fest to get enough upgrades to be able to win. Took about three hours total, but it was a fun three hours!
B009X01FJS|5.0|This is my first tablet. Only downside is I can't charge it when closing the case. No biggie though! I just charge it during the night and it is good to go all day!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|So interesting to hear the details of what makes a Bill Gates or a star athlete or a math whiz!<br />If you are a teacher or a business owner or a new parent, this book is or you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is probably the best book I've ever read. It is excellently written, and really connects the reader with the adventures of hazel and gus. It made me laugh and cry so much. I have memorized many great quotes from this book , though I can barely memorize a philosophical question from Aristotle or Socrates in history class. I will definitely be reading more john green books, and I hope they work extra hard on the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend told me about this show.  Didn't think I would like it but I'm hooked!  Historical soap opera fiction, love it!!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It Is Just Like amazon.com. I love it. It's Great!<br />I will not take it off my tablet. Download Now.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|It reminds me of my past from when I lived in New Hampshire when I went to the hospital.<br />It was fun.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This App is great! It is just like ebay.com.<br />Lets just say it is awesome! Works Great On Android.<br />Let's Download it now.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I am an American living in Europe and use Deb's blog all the time for yummy, made-from-scratch recipes. I don't think I have ever made something of her's that has not turned out fantastic. I received this beautiful book as a gift and am so excited to have it in my collection. I never write reviews but just made the buttered popcorn cookies and in an effort not to eat the entire mixing bowl of raw dough decided to come in here and give her some props. If you like to make things out of real ingredients you will love this book!!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I loved this book, it was so interesting. It was breathtaking, just beautiful, and amazing. Must read book. If you like dystopian books, this is a great book.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|If you like bloody,gory and really scary movies then thats the perfect movie for you or if you really like the original one you have to see that remake. Actors played awesome and realistic (especially Jane Levy).Fede Alvarez made the best horror movie yet.
B005PK57IK|4.0|We have enjoyed this series more than most. We  do not have television per se and what we view from either Netflix or Amazon Prime. Waiting to on season 4  to go on Prime - the sooner the better. One of the better &#34;lawyer&#34; shows in recent memory. If you like legal shows this will work.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyed reading The Racketeer but I didn't feel this was as good as some of Gresham's earlier novels. The ending was blah.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I wanted to get more from this story than was actually there, and as such, it didn't work for me. Strayed took on a crazy goal, hiking the PCT, without any real hiking experience or even know-how. She certainly had gumption! But her motivation and ultimate emotional &#34;breakthroughs&#34; gave me problems.<br /><br />It seemed to me her motivation was as poorly grounded as every other impulsive decision she made, be it to sleep with any number of strangers, get into a 'relationship' with a druggie and join him using heroin, or even chewing opium root with a craggy coot she stumbled upon on the trail... In other words, they were all impulsive and irresponsible choices with no consideration for the potential consequences, personal or otherwise. Granted, she now recognizes those behaviors as risky, even dumb (at least in some cases), and suggests the PCT decision was an effort to work through these tendencies of hers. But there's no indication that she did a lot of emotional processing about her behavior on the hike - in fact, she continued to demonstrate the same behaviors from end to end of the trek. I'm not suggesting that she has to follow my moral code on these issues, only that the growth she suggests she achieved in these areas doesn't match the narrative, and I found the disconnects unsatisfying.<br /><br />Her emotional  motivation - which I understood to be to work through and break out of the massive, overwhelming, destructive grief she felt since her mother died 4 years prior - was both serious and seriously necessary. In fact, I've never read a description of grief that was darker. Clearly it gripped her heart and soul in the tightest of fists; so much so that the intensity (and repetitiveness) of it was at times hard to take. But it was equally hard to accept that she didn't seek professional help for it, as it was so plainly out of control, for 4 years no less. Regardless, she claims to have had all sorts of breakthroughs here, but at least from her description, I never understood quite how. Strayed spends more text describing all her sexual longings than she does explaining how she got from incapacitated with grief to finally settled (and functional) with it. I got the feeling that it just &#34;happened&#34; to her vs. she worked through it consciously, deliberately, and with determination to rebuild a healthy psyche for herself. Again, the growth she says she achieved in this area didn't match the narrative (to me) and I found this disconnect unsatisfying as well.<br /><br />Finally, i was annoyed by the inordinate amount of space she spent describing one particular sexual escapade along the way. It smacked of being the editor's fault, as in, &#34;the &#34;formula&#34; for a best seller has to include a lengthy and explicit sexual event, so be sure you devote a chapter to at least one&#34;. Aside from her many descriptions of her immense grief, It was the most thoroughly detailed event in the book. We know less about how she managed to hike 12-14 miles a day for 3 whole months, with feet blistered and bleeding and toenails coming off, than we do about her &#34;date&#34; at one waypoint on the trail. (I'm sorry, but it is hard to believe that all she had to do to keep going on her ravaged feet was to count her steps to 100 over and over.) I don't object to the inclusion of the event, or even the details of it, but that it was so obviously gratuitous. Had she processed her other experiences as thoroughly it might've felt more balanced. Instead, I got the impression that that one night was more meaningful to her (though we don't really know what the meaning was) than figuring out why she dived so willingly into using heroin (other than &#34;it was just a phase&#34;). Frustrating and unsatisfying .<br /><br />So, even though the prose is good and the sheer challenges of the PCT kept me interested, I ultimately was disappointed in the book. Those are the reasons I gave it 3 stars.cription, I never understood quite how.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was on a reading list from a writer I love. It is a lovely book and I could not put it down. I have several summer birthday gifts to buy and now I have my book to give!
B00CW665VI|5.0|..........yeah that's the appendage most men think with. And Emma Chase does a phenomenal job diving into the larger \\"head\\" and giving us an introduction to the male mind. BRILLIANT!!! This is a unique read and is told with witty sarcastic humor told from a mans point of view. Just when you think he just doesn't get it (come on ladies most men don't) Drew finally figures it out. I Definitely have a different perspective from a mans point of view about women, their lower region and what it's like being a MAN. Loved this book so much!!!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The charger does not charge any faster.  That's what i was expecting to receive, simply a faster speed charger. Maybe you'll come up with one that is faster.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I had been waiting for this sequel for months.  Archer writes true to history and geneology and keeping the reader on your toes.  It is hard to leave the book long enough to eat a meal; or go to bed at a decent hour.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I've been cataloging songs according to Key now for quite some time and I'm almost embarrassed to say I have, well, more than seven-hundred `favorite' songs, but, really, who has seven-hundred favorite songs?  But there they are, songs that one can consistently enjoys practicing one's musical instruments with, or singing along to, or just to enjoy a good dance.  But on rare occasions there comes along a song that one knows is a Classic, a song with some Universal Quality in it that almost transcends just being a Hit, a song that becomes one of the voices of our Civilization, a song that seems to have percolated up from the very Earth Itself.  And that song is Rod Stewart's \\"Beautiful Morning\\" off his new \\"Time\\" CD.<br /><br />Before discussing the song, first, I need to set down the lyrics.  You see, on the little CD jacket, they include the lyrics, but left out the words from the beautifully frantic little middle break (I think the song went into post production when somebody realized it had a bit more potential), and when I went On Line to search those lyrics up on all of those pages that offer Song Lyrics, well, guess what I found?  Apparently they have Song Lyric Software, which all those Sites use now - you play the song and it spits out what Machine Language thinks is the best rendering of any possible combination of words that might be the lyrics of the song in question.  And, wow! Is that Software dumb!  Anyway, getting the Real Words took human intervention... First, I looked at the CD Jacket, which none of the Lyric Sites bothered to do, which could have saved their Poor Machines quite a bit of embarrassment, and I listened about 20 times to those passages in question until I arrived at something that made sense to a Human Being.  So here are the Real Lyrics to Rod Stewart's \\"Beautiful Morning\\":<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Morning\\" by Rod Stewart, C. Kentis, D. Kirkpatrick, C. Korsch, D. Palmer, and P. Warren<br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this BeautifulMorning<br />On this Beautiful Morning here with you<br /><br />Driving down the highway on a Friday evening<br />Me and my lady heading south for the weekend<br />Early start, left the city behind us<br />God to be together, there's a lot we gotta discuss<br /><br />Pull into Starbucks for a donut and a coffee<br />That's when I noticed it was all around me<br />A new day dawning and it's gonna be a winner<br />Roll out the summer, we're tired of winter<br /><br />See the sun coming over them hills<br />See that hare running through the fields<br />Bluebirds singing, not a cloud in the sky<br />Oh my God ain't it good to be alive<br /><br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning here with you<br /><br />No hesitation when we check into our hotel<br />Down by the ocean `bout a mile outta Frisco<br />Four poster bed in a room with a sea view<br />Lots a sexy loving on our personal menu<br /><br />Don't' you worry `bout  unpacking that case<br />Get down to the beach feel the sun on your face<br />Seagull singing not a cloud in the sky<br />What a wonderful day to be alive<br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning here with you<br /><br />(break...)<br />This weekend is gonna go real fast<br />Let's make every minute last<br /><br />(background singers: )<br />Wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa<br /><br />Sing and dance and jump around<br />We could get drunk and all fall down<br />And most of all - no regrets<br /><br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning<br />On this Beautiful Morning ... (repeat, repeat, repeat....)<br /><br />Yep, great lyrics.  But now let's look more closely at that song.  It starts with a Rock and Roll Sunrise, a Dawning, a Something  of Light coming out the Darkness, the Immanent becoming Manifest.... Great production decisions were made so they could do that without having to bringing in an Orchestra.  Anywaythe Mood is set.<br /><br />The first verse is in the past tense.  We find a couple doing the best to put some happiness into their lives.  They're taking a weekend.  But they have things to `discuss', and we all know what that is code for.  Any time a couple needs `to talk' it is never about how well things are going.  But this is a basically optimistic couple, trying to live up to what has become the World's New Religious Ideal, being Happy and contributing to the general Happiness.  But the very pressure of trying to be Happy all the time sometimes is enough to just bum us out, and so couples have to `talk'.<br /><br />But then, in the Starbucks verse, a Miracle happens.  Walking through the parking lot, coffee in hand, somewhere just outside of San Jose, our Songster is suddenly hit by a Zen Moment, a Satori Experience, he is frozen in some Eternal Moment of Pure Joy.  There is Consciousness of Change of State - Winter is displaced by a sudden Summer.  In the next verse we find that images are locked into his Experience and become Material Expressions of the overflowing Bliss - the streaming rays of the sun breaking over the hill, a carefree rabbit seen in the nearby vacant lot, the morning songbirds singing... all become integral to this moment of transcendental transfixion.  \\"Oh my God ain't it good to be alive\\".  It is like Julie Andrews in \\"The Sound of Music\\" spinning like a maniac on top of an Alpine Mountain, except it is a parking lot in the California Wine Country, but the Face of God remains the same.<br /><br />Then the song becomes almost frantically desperately happy.  There is no more discussion, no more `hesitation'.  Chores of unpacking are foregone, and there is a hurry and a rush to soak up as much happiness as possible while it lasts.  We go from \\"Oh my God ain't it good to be alive\\" to \\"What a wonderful day to be alive\\", and the middle break's \\"This weekend is gonna go real fast\\" - the Happiness is seen in context of its Temporal Limitations.This is a Religious Experience of somebody who had had a Religious Experience before, and knowing that they are only Great while they last.  Now, remember, Rod Stewart is an old veteran from the \\"Drop Out\\" Generation, where people let wonderful weekends that were almost absolutely happy and joyess fool them into thinking that Life could always be like that, if one avoided work, duties and responsibilities.  But it was a Cultural Mirage that lasted only a moment in our Civilized History but nonetheless stranded a large fraction of an entire Generation.  The Survivors realized they had to `get back to work', but the Ideal of Happiness hung on despite the qualifications, limitations and obstacles.  We would be happy or die trying.<br /><br />But the truly Beautiful thing about this song is that we really are seeing a True Universal Experience of Transcendental Bliss - the overwhelming Joy of a Weekend Vacation is indeed thorough, Real, genuine in every sense - \\"Sing, dance, jump around... get drunk and all fall down... and no regrets\\".  Our songster is stuck in a Euphoric Manic Episode, grinning ear to ear.  So the background singers are pumping out those  \\"Wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa  wu-aa's\\".  Remember the old Zen Puzzle?...  the Zen Student asked the Old Zen Master how to achieve Satori, and the Old Guy just says \\"wu\\".  Well, we finally know what `wu' means.<br /><br />Should it bother us if the State of Bliss is just temporary... a wonderful weekend?  Well, not really.  In Saint Teresa's \\"Interior Castle\\", which speaks of the 7 Stages leading toward Spiritual Perfection, we find that the Universal Experience is had from Stage 4 and 5 onward, but only becomes permanent at Stage Seven... but each Experience brings one that much closer to the Always and Forever.<br /><br />And that is what this song has - Rod Stewart's \\"Beautiful Morning\\" has a huge chunk of Always and Forever in it, a perky happy grinning song with a Universal Message in it that speaks directly to our Civilization - It's aspirations and therefore its direction.  Indeed, looking back, I think this is the first Truly Important Song of the Third Millennium - yes a grinning happy almost stupid song, but it speaks to us all, it speaks of us all, showing us what we want to be, hope to be, and maybe just maybe, what we finally will Be.  Maybe our Civilization will one day be a Happy One.  And this song will be seen as having been something of a Milestone or Signpost, and Rod Stewart a Prophet of Better Days to Come.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a great game its fun for me and everyone else I know I love it and so do my friends and family
B003VS0CX8|5.0|They love this movie, it's a classic!!!  but the one in blu-ray has a special feature which can let you sing-a-long with lyrics coming out at the bottom of the screen which makes the experience watching this movie even more interesting.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  It was written with integrity and creativity.  The main character shows a sense of purpose in her life even though she has come from a very dysfunctional childhood.  I couldn't put it down!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I love this movies because it brings back memories when me & my daughter used to watch this movie when she was small, especially the part where the crocodile chased Captain Hook...... we still laugh at it & my daughter now is a teenager.  I will recommend this movie to all the young people & also those young at heart.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Interesting view of the lives of the aristocracy in England. As an American you can definitely see how some of the traditions have carried over.
B004AO4FJ4|3.0|This Doctor doesn't do it for me. Too smiley and aloof (in a bad way).  I like Rose though.  Normal girl, not some out of place supermodel.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was pulled into this story from the beginning.  I didn't realize this had transpired in our country during those hard times. It was a good story and well written.  I had a hard time putting it down, and couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Am going to recommend it to my book club.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very fast loading for very specific locations. I have tried several other apps and none of them offer such quick response or so much information.
B00005N6KG|3.0|It deserves its price. Overall, it is ok for general use. My boy friend doesn't like it, he was planning to use it while running. But it turned to be too slippery to stay on his hair.
B000W1W9EW|5.0|of course it is..you know that.<br /><br />my first exposure to a nick drake song<br />was sebadoh's cover of pink moon<br />back in the 90's.<br /><br />for whatever reason i didnt really listen to nick himself<br />until 2007 when i was working at night by myself<br />listening to a playlist of hundreds of songs made by other coworkers,<br />and this record came on the speakers.<br /><br />i think id always known id get it eventually.<br /><br />i think i had to grow up alot to really get it.<br /><br />now i feel i do more and more.<br /><br />a short perfect quiet melancholy record.<br /><br />very little going on, nothing but what's absolutely necessary.<br /><br />anyway, get it if you love music.
B003PDQEBS|4.0|A simple story about a complex relationship. Watch it for the masterful acting job of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Another great show.  Waiting impatiently for the next episode.  Been hooked on it for a long time.  Will keep watching.
B00B8ESWAM|5.0|Watch Joaquin Phoenix act his way to another Oscar nomination. But be warned,. This film is NOT for everyone. I was stunned after the first several scenes. But  I could not take my eyes off of Phoenix in action. Think about his presence in such movies as &#34;Two Lovers&#34; and &#34;Walk the Line&#34; and you'll see how he has transformed himself into this completely different type of character! Just when I think I've been wowed enough, in comes Philip Seymour Hoffman at his best! Worth the watch if you can stomach the story.
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|Typically predictable comedy designed to give The Diva Streisand center stage. If you like BS, you'll like this one. Otherwise, prepare to be bored to death. Better yet, rent What's Up Doc -- it's funny.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|But....so if the PBS 25th Anniversary concert was available on CD, I would have purchased that.  After watching that performance with Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, it's hard to listen to anyone else.  Ms. Hathaway is clearing the star, as is Samantha Banks.
B005GIS7GK|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I am not a particular fan of Seth Rogan, but he really is brilliant in the titular role of Paul the stoner alien. The dialog is really funny, and I especially love the way they mercilessly rip into stupid fundies who think the Earth is 6000 years old.<br /><br />Science Fiction fans will especially love this movie; it is loaded with cute homages to classic science fiction movies. I laughed my ass off at the closing credits.

B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|Michael Crichton at his best.  Even though it is a bit tame by today's standards, it is still an excellent film, showcasing some of the earliest digitized effects on screen.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|I love this film. The soundtrack is exceptional. The young Australian stars light up the screen in this film and it offers some campy scenes that put it over the top in the humor department.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This story is a big favorite of mine--I've bought it in paperback, hardback, and on my kindle so I can share it and read it weather my arthritic hands can hold the book open or not.  This story is soft and sweet, full of mystery and even horror [mental illness] and deep sadness.  Curl up in a comfortable place because your going to be there for a while once you get absorbed into this tender tell.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. The tropical location, the heartbreaking story and the haunting music all come together in a film that you will not forget. The cast is first rate with Robert DeNiro, Jeremy Irons, Aiden Quinn, and a young Liam Neeson.
B0094M4OW0|4.0|This movie is excellent. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a great team. They should make a Part 3. Or some other movie together.
067101756X|5.0|Excellent reading.  I became interested in this book when a friend told me about the author who was a friend of his.  I highly recommend reading.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The game is fun, both my daughter and I love it.<br />But you cant go far unless you have friends to help and you have to buy gems and coins.<br />Locks you out. Turns off. Don't give coins and gems when earned.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I believe this is one of the more original sounding albums from American Idol stock.  She's not afraid to use tunes of another era of music and make it feel new.  If you like the faster beats of the 60's, Motown, and even the 50's, you will find that this album picks up from those times, and then some!  I listen to this album when I need some perking and cheering up.  Love it!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|The author says her goal was to make people cry, and so she was very successful. It is a sweet book, with that kind of love that you can only find in books.<br />I will certainly start Linger next.
B000LB4DWO|2.0|This is the worst Superman movie ever made. Bad Casting, Acting & Not much of a story as well.  Kevin Spacey bad choice As Lex Luthor<br />( enough of Lex. Should have had brainiac )
B004UB9SKS|4.0|This has been a good app for helping us to learn Danish.  We have had really good experiences with it.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was funny and sweet.  I can relate to it, having raised two daughters close in age, who drove us crazy!  I actually was hesitant to watch this because I really did not like \\"Knocked Up\\" but I'm glad I watched this movie!
1616550414|5.0|This book is a fantastic summary and detailed look at the history of The Legend of Zelda and all of its games.  Fantastic artwork pages, and explanations of plot lines of games.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie because I generally don't like Tarantino's movies, but I loved it.  Have seen it twice so far.
B003IDMUSG|4.0|It was typically Grisham in is suspense buildup and just so well crafted and told. However it would have been totally complete to know whether she had found someone new or been hit by a truck or???
B008S4YZCO|5.0|My dd7 just loves this game! Says it's one of the best games she's played. Playing on Kindle Fire with no issues.
B00CW665VI|1.0|I got this book because of the ratings.  I only got to about 17% and returned it.  It was not as good as the reviews state.  Spoiler alter.  I do not think it is believable that the star of the company who is the son of the owner would have to compete for a client.  The son is the star of the company and now he has to complete with a girl who just got out of college.  Would not happen.  Did not read more did not need to.
B005PK57IK|4.0|After Season 1: My husband is in jail and Season 2: I'm sleeping with my boss, it was a relief to have season 3 without some overarching stressor.

B000FC146C|5.0|I read  The Thorn Birds when it first came out in the late 70's.  After watching a little of the TV mini series I decided to re-read the book.  It remains one of my all time favorite novels!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love hidden object games and this game was a great break from them. It makes you think. Can't wait for the next one.

However, on inside of package states you must download by 12/31/2012.  Code does not work.  Where's my digital copy, Amazon? I'll update to 5 stars when I get a working download code.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Not the sort of story that you cannot put down.  Maritime-wise it was somewhat lacking in expertise and at times too far-fetched, but high marks for originality.
B004KAB3ZM|5.0|He writes pretty well, and of course the events he describes are monumentally important.<br /><br />The things that strikes my repeatedly in the narrative is how ad hoc and &#34;seat of the pants&#34; the whole program progresses.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful look back to more simple times! Lovely character development. Pure enjoyment. I couldn't tear myself away from season one to the last episode of season four.
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|I have always enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it. I really love the thesis and the possibilities that it's possible.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is a cute little game and got too many high ratings to be dev-friend ratings. Installed from FAOTD.<br />The graphics are very good for such a simple small-file game and the puzzles are challenging, and can occupy a lot of time or just a quick few minutes in a doctor office waiting room.<br />Having a high mechanical aptitude, this seems to be the target demographic for this game. If you like fishing and untangling the knoted fishing line that accompanies the sport, you will probably enjoy this game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app works very well.the graphics are good just about everything.here's a hint-try to get the moon stage because u get tons and tons of air time money!so download this app and have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is my favorite game ever and it is way more funner than temple run and I already have Jake and all the girls for characters plus temple run slows down and this is super quick on the tablets just not the I pod touch but you should get this FREE app now!!!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I'm not sure I will ever forgive Julian Fellowes for killing off Mathew Crawley, but then it keeps the series moving forward -- lots of deaths in the series, that's for sure.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love being able to make my little village. It is a lot of fun to build it with my son. Plus the animals are really cute.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book is more than the story of Steve Jobs and Apple, it provides a history of the technology revolution. Although I am a little older than Jobs, I lived in California in the 1960's and 1970's and can also identify with the counter-culture of the time and how many of us &#34;sold out&#34; as we matured and became business men and women. Finally the book describes the risks and rewards of inventing something new and how running a business often requires different skills. Although a thick book Issacson's writing style is easy to read.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie was awesome - Bradley Cooper proves that he's more than just a pretty face. And Jennifer Lawrence, amazing!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Thought provoking commentary and worth the read. I don't share the dilemma about child care personally but learned a lot about that issue and the rest of the commentary was helpful.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|entertaining, a everyday sheriff living in a town of genius'. There are problems we never contend with. How about a house that gets mad if you do not call that you will be late for dinner.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Sometimes I cannot believe that this is on television, it is so dark and cinematic.  It is much better than the second Hannibal film and much better than either version of Red Dragon - and I mean, so far each episode tops them.

B00CL6GAD2|3.0|What is so good about a Wahlberg film, and it runs in the family, the two boys work harder than the actors around them.  If this film had just been about Mark and his sidekick smartass secretary, Alona Tal, solving a good case, it would have probably been a film noir classic and turned this unknown actress into the next Carole Lombard.  These two have such great chemistry and are so deliciously funny and sexy playing off of each other it was amazing.  Their scenes together stood out.  Russell Crowe actually was lousy in this.  He said his lines, but was this really the kind of acting an Oscar winner should be giving us?  Catherine Zeta Jones was very good and her two or three scenes in the film were perfection and she and Wahlberg played off of each other very well.  Is there anybody Wahlberg can't play well with?  His mother really taught him well.  I did enjoy the film and it was well plotted, however, Crowe's evident enui stifled his scenes.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|This was a fun fantasy story, very well done, and with several &#34;Downton&#34; members. It is definitely family friendly, but without being dulled down as such. I highly recommend it!
B00985E3UG|5.0|I don't normally read books about food. This book is one that everybody should read. What the Food Giants have done is give us what we crave. Unfortunately, our cravings were developed eons ago and have not changed. The Food Giants figured out how to take advantage of these primeval cravings to do what they do best -- make money. The unfortunate side effect is our current obesity problem. After reading this book, going to grocery store is a whole new experience.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is my &#34;Go to&#34; game while waiting just about anywhere. It is easy to start and stop without wondering where you left off. It is simple, fun and requires just enough strategy to keep it from being &#34;brainless&#34; but is simple enough to do without really thinking. A great game to wind down with, wait with, or kill time with. A definite thumbs up!
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Timeless wisdom that can and should be read over and over. This is my second time reading it and I love the new insights I've gained.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is an awesome game! So much fun to be a shark! It is very well designed, entertaining, exciting, and the perfect escape from daily stress. Having a bad day at the office? Eat some unsuspecting swimmers! Feeling inferior? Become a Great White Shark and rule the ocean! As an added bonus, you can accessorize your shark with jewelery, hats, even a baby shark! There is just something very satisfying about the lovely crunching of a sea turtle at the end of the day....
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Great book, pleasant read. Interesting to find out more about the background, lifestyle and ideas of the man who was able to build a great company with his own unique set of talents, creativity, intuition and know-how. Refreshing to know that Jobs did not censure any parts of the book and gave his biographer permission to candidly write about his flaws as he saw fit.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love abc for creating this series of books to go with the castle show. It's absolutely great and as I read I couldn't help but imagine Kate, Rick, Ryan, and Javi acting out the scenes in the book. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0026PA05M|5.0|I found this group on Amazon, listened to some clips and have been buying an album every pay day. Excellent voices and songs.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|just another great season for a great show.  a few very touching episodes and watching the characters grow, all while being funny!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love it. It is awesome apart from the fact there is only four Colors. ♥It is so much fun!  I love it!!♥
B009GED3HS|5.0|i resisted watching this show for a long time, but when you don't have cable or satellite, just the ROKU, you find out that you actually like some of the shows you didn't watch, especially one that's been on 8 seasons.  And this past season was really great
B00COGY2P2|3.0|for the 'name' stars that were in this movie, I expected it to be more kick-ass. just another sort-of-ok movie by tom (the mope) cruise.

B005HI4LMS|4.0|it was a good and funny movie this movie was intense and not quite what you would expect fof rom this  type movie
B000NY12LO|5.0|The story is about a high school student who has been bullied throughout his life.  It evokes a wide range of emotions from empathy for the young man to impatience with a female student who had befriended him on their first day of school.  Upon beginning high school, the girl deserts him in favor of being part of the \\"in\\" crowd.  Though she struggles with disloyalty to him, he remains a friend to her.  The story demonstrates the pressures on teenagers to fit in and the potential consequences, in this case extreme, for those who do not.
B003THHIEM|5.0|The quality of the video plays well on my PC. As a fellow writer, the concept of the series is ideal for this cast.  The friction and attraction is well acted.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Good book can't believe it's over! I want to know how her and Sam turn out! I recommend the series
B002PZC8BM|5.0|This series is one of my favorites that I discovered by watching reruns. I like the interpersonal relationships between the characters.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Saw this on cable a few months back. Just had to have it. Great anthology and even greater music. Eagles forever!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it,  was just as good as his other books Daemon and Freedom. Can't wait for his next book.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|The real magic trick here is the evolution of style. How boring would it be if Daft Punk just recycled the same sound and feeling over and over? Every new album brings a new iteration- I wouldn't expect anything less. A lot of people are disappointed that this isn't the club banger they've come to expect from the robots. Relax! The remixes will come for you.<br />In the meantime, this is some tasty future/past time travel. Brilliant and absolutely essential to listen all the way through on headphones.<br />As I was born in 73 and recall all of those family road trips with The Doobies blaring out of the 8-track, I literally was laughing with joy and simultaneously sobbing with nostalgia at &#34;Fragments of Time.&#34; I'm looking forward to hearing what they do next.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|The real story unravels slowly and carefully as you are pulled along by the sub plots showing the kindness of our fellow man
B000TERDHA|4.0|well, I'm super late to this party, considering LCD is no more. I recall hearing Tribulations on the radio waaaay back when it came out, loving it but never knowing what it was. Due to some DJ's sloppy attribution, I thought it was Franz Ferdinand- was pretty disappointed when I bought their album, LOL. So anyway, all these years later, finally found what I was looking for. (Thanks to Daft Punk, actually- don't we all wish they were playing at our house, our house?) Tribulations is still fantastic, On Repeat, Disco Infiltrator, Too Much Love, Losing My Edge, Beat Connection, Yeah... there really isn't a dud in the bunch. If you like to dance, buy it. If you don't like to dance, this might change your mind!
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|Action packed movie with twist and turns. Great in series which you should watch in sequence. Not bad for rainy Saturday afternoon.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Wow. This book is incredible. Stead captures the voice of a 12 year old girl's ever developing perspective with poignant (though occasionally repetitive) similes and simple descriptions that often convey more about Miranda than Miranda herself even knows. This book is a light, wonderful read that bends your mind and breaks your heart, all with a gentle touch. A warm read!
B004UPANGM|1.0|Horrible acting, horrible premise, horrible graphics, and horrible movie! Should not have been made. This movie is hard to watch because it makes no sense! If you just want some horror, you might be able to watch it after taking a drink or two.
0525478817|5.0|I love books that are written like this. They both know they already like each other and the whole book is spent on them being together not chasing after each other. I also love the bursts of humor.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am enjoying it..... a lot.... its very educational and entertaining..... the only time I had to stop reading it...was to go to a fast food store to fetch  STRAWS  and get  wire hangers....... still reading it  and will gladly  rate it again  when I finish it.....
1451696191|5.0|I love this book for the way it's written as if they are letters to someone but you don't know who, which makes it kind of feel like they're to you and they're more personal. I really wanted to know what happened to Charlie after the book ended. I wanted to know how the rest of his high school years went. If he stayed friends with everyone and if he started to fit in or he became more lonely with all of them gone.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I have a 7, 5 &4 year old who watched it and loved it! It is like the kids version of Indiana Jones / the Mummy. The kids were really engrossed in it the whole way through.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the way Harold needed to walk without knowing why.  He had to say goodbye to queenie and she would wait.  I became more and more hooked as I read and could not wait to finish but did not want to finish.  What a wonderful novel, in the best sense of wonderful.  Thanks!  Five stars from me; six if that were allowed.  David
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book grabbed my interest from the start. Although there is sadness there is humor as well. The only complaint I have is that the twist is too obvious. I really enjoyed how the lives of the two main characters intersect.
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Liked plot. I like drama. CIA has undercover plots that are interesting. I also liked the Numbers Station as well.  I would watch more movies like Erased.  The backround noise needs to be toned down, it drowned out the talking
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very useful application if your looking for a bible that is very vesitile and has great study plans
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Like the title says, I'm keeping this simple.<br /><br />If your only experience with Iron Man has been the movies, you will likely enjoy this movie.  Not as much as the first and probably more than the second, but you'll like it.<br /><br />However, if you are a fan of the character and are aware of the history of Iron Man, you will HATE the movie.<br /><br />In the first movie, I was willing to overlook the changes made for artistic license and to help make a decent movie and franchise.  When the second movie came out, I was disturbed by the continued changes and poor choice of directions the movie took.<br /><br />But, this movie and especially the big \\"twist\\" had me wanting to throw my popcorn at the screen and leave the theater.<br /><br />Overall, this movie felt rushed, predictable and poorly written.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Pretty fun game, but it locks up and forces you to close and then reopen after a completed game in order to continue.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I thought it was very well done. It is true that Gary Cooper seemed a little old for the part, but I thought he did a great job.<br /><br />I read the book a long long time ago and found it to be quite amazing. The movie was a nice reminder, and quite relevant to the current time. We are faced with leaders who seek power in exactly the way it is described in the movie. At our universities there is a a serious attempt to destroy what was the best in the world, and to replace it with mediocrity. The tool is the diversity/equity movement, a fake idea that serves only those who gain their power from its implementation. As described in the movie, the parasites are moving in and feeding on what was created by the individual minds that made the university.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Very happy I found this series. I've been loving every minute of it. Very well done, best SciFi series since firefly.
B006M4F67A|4.0|It has several variations of Mahjong boards to play. It works fairly well, but app forecloses on both devices I use it on.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Love looking at the whole season of Glee, very entertaining and interesting to relive it from the beginning again and again
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I ordered it by mistake.....didn't really like it the first time I read it......only read a few pages and deleted it..
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This App is great. It tests many facets of exercise for the mind.  My wife and I both enjoy the App.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I watched this with my mom.  We both liked it and consider it worth seeing.  I love that you can just rent movies from Amazon, very handy for those evenings when there is nothing is on tv.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Even if you have read these stories before this book is a recommended read. Plus, the Kindle version of this book is available at an attractive price. I particularly enjoyed comparing the stories and characters as ACD wrote them against the recent movie (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows) which is set in approximately the same time frame as the ACD stories and the recent modernized versions on PBS (Sherlock) and CBS (Elementary).
B0091REZMW|5.0|I accidentally uninstalled this game and Now I have to start all over! Omg. This totally stinks. I was at level 40. Grr.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I read all of the Caster Chronicles and found that I liked them almost as much as Twilight. I definitely would recommend the books to anyone 14 or over as fun easy reads with a great imaginative story. This movie could have been great and they could have set it up to have sequels...because they made the story end with no hope of another, they wrapped the story up in ways that didn't make sense or follow the book at all. Honestly, you could see the movie before reading the books or vise versa and nothing would be spoiled; they are that different. So with that in mind, taking the book series out of the picture and just looking at it as a movie, it still wasn't great. An adolescent might enjoy it but that's about it. There is no character development and the stereotypes are over the top. I did enjoy the costumes and special effects. So all in all, adequate movie if you are not expecting The Caster Chronicles, horrible movie if you are.
0071390111|5.0|I am a urologist specializing in neurologically impaired patients so I read Kandels newest edition once they become available.  This edition is superb with colorful and easily understood illustrations, diagrams and radiology studies including PET scans.  The print is very legible and the spacing is perfect.  It took a month to read the 1700 pages but its the best book i have read these last 10 years with Bruce Alberts Molecular Biology of the Cell whose 6th edition should be out later this year.  I really found the molecular biology and anatomy chapter the perfect reintroduction for me.  It provided me with the perfect detail and understanding for a paper I am writing on Strokes and their Effect on the Bladder.  The disease specific Chapters on Stroke, Parkinsons, Multiple Sclerosis each are well detailed but with excellent explanations of the principles necessary for the clinician to get a strong hold on this relevant material.  These chapters should be standard reading for all medical students and residents.  The radiological studies chosen to illustrate these disease entities are the best i have seen and explain what is important to know and understand for each type of stroke, progressive MS or non progressive MS.  I purchased it early after its release new for 70 dollars so with its success it will soon be a classic at 100 plus dollars and will still be worth every penny.  I will now use this to teach my students the fundamentals of a neurological exam and to emphasis the commonly seen neurological disease seen by urologists.  Thank you Dr Kandel for a book well worth the 7 year wait.
B00821OX98|5.0|The concept of Falling Skies is unique despite the plethora of alien's taking over films and movies over the years since H.G. Well's first take in 1898. Featuring a talented cast, great writing, and realistic CGI, this serialized TV program has the quality of a movie. Anyone who enjoys quality science fiction drama, like Battlestar Galactica, would do no wrong watching this.<br /><br />The story moves forward at an even pace where major events that change the characters and setting significantly are handled slowly and built up to with each episode, utilizing foreshadowing mechanics that most modern serial TV programs fail to use. Between the major events are many minor triumphs and tragedies, each episode containing the story around how the group survives another one of these challenges. This gives every show a feeling of importance to the overall progress, allowing for a rich and in depth tale to unfold.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am personally ecstatic for the upcoming season 3 starting June 9th on TNT
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is great.  Always worth listening to, and learning something new. Even want to listen to topics I know nothing about.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|One of the only current shows running I watch - great acting, great plot lines, and beautifully shot. If you have any interest in the Hannibal/Will Graham storyline, this is a must-see. A great crime drama too, even if you aren't already into the Hannibal books or movies.
B003V5CFV8|2.0|My family just doesn't prefer to listen to the foul language in this movie.  It was somewhat funny, but not something I would recommend.

B00AO2TREY|4.0|My review is called \\"What is the deal America\\" because there are only 6 reviews here as of 5/25/13. Hurts is an incredible band, so I'm trying to figure out why so few people are talking about \\"Exile\\", released in March 2013. I guess it's because there are no 30 second samples here that people try to review songs from (That's a bad idea to begin with) Maybe it is because some people are too cheap to buy an import CD, and are waiting for a domestic release. Maybe it is because they can't get a \\"quick fix\\" at Amazon with a MP3 download on this release.<br /><br />  This is one of the best albums of 2013. They have changed styles a bit from \\"Happiness\\"  This one has a harder rock edge, and if you don't see the Muse influence with \\"Exile\\" then you don't know who Muse is.<br /><br />  They fill arenas around the world , but only six people have anything to say about this album? It's puzzling!<br /><br />  Here are my picks (favorites) on \\"Exile\\"<br /><br />EXILE (The Muse influence/style is found on this track more than any other song. I wonder what Muse thinks about this song!)<br /><br />SANDMAN<br />BLIND<br />ONLY YOU<br />THE CROW (A huge tip of the hat to Chris Issac)<br />THE ROPE<br />SOMEBODY TO DIE FOR (Roy Orbison and Bono come to mind here)<br />HEAVEN<br />HELP<br />GUILT (and the fantastic hidden track When I'm Gone)<br /><br /> I hope the folks at Sony will release this disc in the USA.  With all the crappy indie releases getting exposure , why not let an established group get the attention it deserves here in the states??  Is there anybody out there Sony?

141659521X|3.0|Ok first of all I'm a big fan and I have purchased and own all first edition hard covers of every one of his books, 3 of them are signed; so I'm a fan.  However, I'm also retired military and a gun enthusiast and when I read a book I know it's going to be a stretch for reality but this one is like Vince didn't even do 5 seconds of Wikipedia research before he wrote it.  Granted it was all in the beginning of the book but I think he should have gone back and fixed it so that people like me wouldn't be like \\"come on Vince get real\\".  First an M249 is not a heavy machine gun in fact it fires the exact same round as the M4, the rate of fire is faster and it is belt fed but in a fire fight there would be nothing distinctive about it except for the rate of fire which would have been hard to discern because there were over 20 shooters shooting all at the same time.  If he wanted to talk about a current heavier machine gun the he should have mentioned the M240 which fires the civilian cartridge .308 or military 7.62X51 NATO rather than the .223 or 5.6X45 which the M4 and M249 fire.  Next, I have a 9mm and if you shoot a water filled Prestone bottle most of the rounds will only penetrate one side so shooing an O2 tank with anything less than a high powered rifle preferable with a steel penetrator is going to do nothing at all.  And O2 does not explode it would turn that bottle into a missile but that's about it because O2 does not burn it helps things burn.  Lastly, and another very lazy mistake there is no such things as a Command Master Sergeant in the Air Force.  I was a MSgt in the Air Force and if he would have left off the \\"Command\\" it would have been plausible or even if he would have made her a Chief Master Sergeant who have a reputation for being unyielding and tenacious that would have been fine but there is no such thing as a Command Master Sergeant.  The closest thing we would have to that is a Command Chief Master Sergeant but that position would be right under a full bird Colonel or General and they would not be working a floor of a hospital but rather sitting in an office at headquarters.<br /><br />Overall the book was a good read I liked how he tied in previous books and characters into the story line but overall I would say I was kind of disappointed.  It wasn't the page turner I normally expect from Vince and I was able to put it down for weeks at a time and not really feel the need to read it.a full bird Colonel or General and they would not be working a floor of a hospital but rather sitting in an office at headquarters.<br /><br />Overall the book was a good read I liked how he tied in previous books and characters into the story line but overall I would say I was kind of disappointed.

B002RPR6DU|4.0|As a gardener, avid back-country hiker and conservationist, the underlying message of this movie held my interest despite costumes and set effects that were  - in contrast to today's high-tech capabilities - very dated. I agree with other reviewers that the casting was not nuanced - the three environment-destroying \\"baddies\\" were archetypes (stupidity, cruelty and violence) in stark contrast with the introspective personality of the lead scientist.

B0036EH3WU|1.0|More twists than a mountain road for 5 seasons. Then JJ Abrams havinng an affair with Hurley? Then Boomhaur from king of the Hill steps in and writes and directs the entire season 6 and they air it anyway.  Now that is a better ending than the movie itself :)  Get it!<br /><br />Season 6, the final season of the show is one of the worst things to ever be on television. The show had fabulous actors, but they were all zombies in this season and not just the 2 that were supposed to be. They mindlessly walked through the sets and every episode was just stalling until the final one where the writers would give us one last twist that the flash sideways was an afterlife. Not only that, but it made the first 5 seasons unrewatchable.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|The two lead characters are very conflicted, and unpredictable.  This is indicative of the entire movie, where stars from another era become the supporting cast.  Everyone loves a happy ending in a story like this, but the outcome isn't evident along the way.
B003U4UNUU|1.0|Great Series. More twists than a mountain road. Scifi auro with great writing. Then JJ Abrams having an affair with Hurley and lets his guard down and yep -------------------- Boomhour from King of the Hill wrote, directed and finalized the last drawn out total breakdown of an episode. This Series (Lost) was pushing 4-1/2 stars but all --- but it is wasted by the ending. The final 2 hours of this show stunk so bad that I blame it on Boomhaur!

Not only that, but it made the first 5 seasons unrewatchable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Collins does a masterful job of portraying the emotional currents experienced by the main character.  The empathy and relation the reader can feel for Katniss helps to enthrall readers in the plot, eagerly awaiting each new twist.  The complex symbols in the book help to entertain the most serious readers, but understanding those symbols is not necessary for the enjoyment of the book.  Collins also creates atmospheres very well; the confusion Katniss experiences at the end of the book is reflected fully in the reader's confusion.  Altogether, an excellently devised sequel that is hard to put down.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is the best.  I was able to do ALL the levels. Spend 99 cents on this game, it's worth it.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|&#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; is one of the best books I have read the month.  Christie's witty dialogue and character development are sure to keep any reader amused throughout the entire story, but her surprise ending is utterly unpredictable  This book is the epitome of a good murder mystery.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is great for those of us on the go. Colorful and entertaining. No matter where I go if I get this game up on my Kindle I draw a crowd. The star wars theme music is exactly like the movie.
B00AM7E4P8|4.0|the first half is dedicated to cooking pigs...as a vegetarian was a bit tough getting through it. the making bread experiments were interesting, but on the whole is was not really the history of cooking as i had expected.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can it get any better? This is an amazing book. I saw a few on the twists coming but still a lot caught me off guard. A definite must read.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Fast paced and full of doubts and suspense.  A real page turner that did not disappoint right up to the ending.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I thought this movie was very good and great acting.  It kept your interest throughout the movie and would watch it again.
B00A0A59IS|5.0|I seriously listen to this every day I love one direction and this is just plain out amazing!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
B001C08RHA|3.0|I guess this isn't my type of movie.  Not real enough even though I watched all of Spiderman's videos and really them.
B008VVT51U|4.0|I was prepared to hate this movie and watched it just to be agreeable for a change.  The teaser line about British pensioners in an Indian residence hotel seemed a setup for one cultural cliche after another.  Well, the cliches are certainly present, but before we condemn all cliche we should look at the origins of the word itself.  A 'cliche' was originally the term applied to recurrent patterns of words and letters in the early days of moveable type.  The printer would bind these familiar sequences together so they could be used entire. In essence a cliche was a cluster of words that was familiar through repetition - and therefore worthy of being kept available for frequent use.<br /><br />In this case the familiar social issues (cliches) are in the hands of a super-star cast of characters who treat them with the respect - even reverence - they are due.  This is a movie about ordinary people being wholly ordinary in an extraordinary place.  As wise as it is witty, it's an evening well spent.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|This was a good movie even though it was kind of typical but the acting was very good and kept your interest.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|So often redemption movies are about one damaged person surrounded by compassionate (or not) others who rally round to get them out of whatever ditch they're in - sometimes over and over again.  This movie about about two very damaged people, each of whom knows their own vulnerabilities and is able to be generous to the other out of their shared sense of being defective.  This is no pity-party however.  It's more like high speed emotional bumper cars.  It's also a reminder that behaviors we often pathologize today, so they can be &#34;treated,&#34; are perhaps just &#34;differences&#34; toward which we need to show radical acceptance and compassion.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|From the beginning to the end, this movie was non stop excitement.  A new twist (slippage in time) brings Spock face to face with is Older self.  The effects for this move are both imaginative and brilliant!
B001RMYWG8|4.0|Like many great actors, Pacino is always Pacino.  It's part of why we watch him.  In Serpico the contained energy and dramatic &#34;economy&#34; of his performance is still recognizable in his more recent roles, but there is a smouldering pressure in Serpico (as there is in Michael Corleone in the Godfather) which today more often explodes in &#34;big&#34; scenes.  To convey the same explosive potential while containing it seems to me a higher form of the actor's art.  But then today almost everything in movies explodes or burns, so Pacino is in the mainstream.  It's a movie worth watching carefully.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I know the author is a favorite of many but he failed to totally entrance me. Perhaps I need to try another of his books and see if he can indeed live up to his reputation. The story was interesting but predictable. The ending -- well, I could see it coming a mile away! I think perhaps this type of light love story is just not my cup of tea.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I felt the imaginative challenges of reading the novel were more entertaining than the CGI wizardry.  Maybe it's a generational thing, but these hybrid movies where I know actors are playing in front of a blue screen and a computer wizard is tweaking pixels somewhere else, I have a hard time getting engaged. &#34;Because we can&#34; is sometimes not a good enough reason to do something.  This example is well done, but in the end I have to ask, &#34;So what?&#34;
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of those perfect games to play while waiting on a line. Each game can be as short as one minute.<br />Yet you can dedicate a big amount of time unlocking everything.<br />Highly recommended.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show...I was thrilled when it become available on prime. I have 3 kids & was not able to catch the show during is regular showing during the season. I kept watching for it to come to Netflix or Amazon. I love being able to watch this show on Amazon Prime. I can watch whenever I want and as many episodes as I want. I love it even more that Amazon offers the closed caption option. For those of us who have a hearing impairment, it really helps a lot. Thank you Amazon, I'm not restricted to now to just watching Netflix.

0142001104|1.0|I was actually shocked that Harvard Business School Press accepted this for publication. It is a very vague and shallow work, with nothing specific to offer. It is full of very good intentions but contains no specifics. It reads like a sweet memoir of an orchestra conductor with a big (overblown) saintly ego, mixed with some general life-advise by his wife. Her writing is actually markedly better and she clearly has more ideas. She should have written this book without him.<br />The main point is - there are many better books on the subject. I was barely able to finish this book and I am a very patient reader.
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|Was hoping for a more usable star reference.  The charts are detailed but the navigation through the book is difficult.  Time to get a page recognition feature.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|You just can't get any better than this! With all the relationship hi jinx mixed in with definite nerd lifestyle icons nothing is missed. And it's accurate rendering of today's social mories leaves you rolling on the ground with laughter.

B008K8VDPU|3.0|I thought this should have had easier more well-known songs that everyone would know. All the symphonies from the classical music are nice but it s supposed to be fun not a tryout for Carnegie Hall. Add old mcdonald itsy bitsy spider and such
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|I have been searching high and low for a good book about writing and I can say without hesitation that this is one of the best.<br /><br />The first part of the book I enjoyed tremendously. The mini-biographic about how Stephen King grew to become the prolific author he is today was inspiring and moving. I could relate to the way in which Stephen had written, as I used to have wild ideas that would glue me to the keyboard for hours on end. Yet, after putting down this book, I was able to sit back and realise that - as much as I enjoyed the late night sessions of frantic typing - I was not one of those people who could flesh out and write a novel purely from a single idea.<br />The ideas and tips in this book have made me realise that the structure in which I plan, draft and write needed to change and that if I were to take a serious crack at this writing thing, I would have to change my approach.<br />As much as this may sound like a bad thing to some readers, I will always hold this book in high regard. I have been able to flesh out and develop my ideas to a level that I had not thought possible before and I have started writing in a way that is refreshing and productive. I even printed large type pages and stuck them to the wall of my study where I can remind myself of the contents of this book. \\"Write with the door closed; read with the door open\\" and \\"don't worry about bad writing\\", are constant reminders that send the stress away and console me in times of writers block or procrastination. This book should be at the top of the pile for any new writer.<br /><br />So, if by some cosmic miracle I do make a decent novel and get published, I know exactly who to thank for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun can become addicting. This game is great for horse lover's and children of all ages. Easy to use.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought I'd give this one a try since it was free. Great app even if I'd had to pay well worth it. Fun and challenging for all ages.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read a lot and have no idea how I missed this book when it first came out. Loved everything about it and hated to leave the characters at the end. Escapism with a message- pure joy!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I like both the actor & actress and plot.  Could move a little faster, but that's TV.  Always interested in anything Sherlock Holmes related.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is well developed, graphics are great, but I found it difficult to keep playing for longer periods of time without paying. It is very tempting to just buy extra diamonds (you get only 5 with the next achieved level). I think that was done on purpose. The game is free, but the majority of players want to keep playing instead of putting it aside to wait for the energy bar to fill up again. That's what I do to keep the game free; play untill all my energy is used, set it aside for half a day or more, pick it up again, play another half hour, set it aside and so on. It is sometimes nerve wrecking, but I refuse to pay for something that is advertised as free.<br />*** the last update makes the app shut down on me very often*** please fix soon!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is fairly fun. I really enjoyed it at first, but after playing it for an extended period of time i found myself getting tired of the steady progression of the game. Overall it's a good game to waste some time on. If you don't have something better to do with your time.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Be forewarned that this isn't an Alfred Hitchcock biography but a story about Hitchcock's dedication to produce and direct a movie that most of Hollywood tried to stop him from making: the ground-breaking &#34;Psycho&#34;.  Good performances by Scarlett Johansson and Danny Huston too.  Great rainy night movie.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I bought the ebook and reading on Kindle with my smartphone, this book full with well information and clear picture, easy to follow !!
B00797MB0O|1.0|I was expecting so much more from this movie. I guess there were some kinda funny moments, but nothing that will make up for the mediocre story, horrible character development, bad ending.<br /><br />The movie it's so slow, very boring, embarrassing, and just not good. I would have given it 0 starts if I could, I guess the one comes from ok acting....<br /><br />Don't waist your time watching this.
B0086700CM|5.0|Don't listen to those reviews that say that this game is bad, that's nonsense. Because this game is awesome! When I first noticed this game I couldn't resist looking at the reviews. When I found out the game is fun I bought it. Now there's a new temple runs like temple run two, temple run brave and temple run oz.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|First Album: Hard rock with an industrial edge.<br /><br />Second Album: Hard rock with a hint of pop.<br /><br />Third Album: Pop Rock.<br /><br />This Album: Pop with hints of rock music.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with this album. But I am a hard rock and industrial enthusiast, and this album barely shows a hint of the roots that drew me to them with their early stuff. When I hear it I definitely recognize it as them - their sound is still very distinct. But they have made a very big deal with this and the last album about working with big-name producers and I think they've let the sound of those producers take them too far into a very generic direction.<br /><br />I'd rate this 2.5 stars if it let me - it is well crafted but not made for me, and if you were concerned about the direction they took with their third album this one is even further down that road than before.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Jack Reacher is a tough rough ruthless man who does not care who he hurts or even kills or the cruelty applied in the process.

B008BU75IQ|5.0|Loved it!  As usual, Mr. Archer has me desperate to read the next book in this series.  Bravo  Sir Archer, bravo!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Time to find the reruns. The author is so knowledgeable in her area of anthropological research, she brings a great depth of content to the story.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I don't know if it's the timeliness or the writing skills of the biographer or it's just that Jobs is one of the most interesting people but this was one heck of a book. As a consumer of Apple products since the late 90's I loved the background stories of so many products. I loved reading about how Jobs changed so many designs and was so instrumental in Pixar's ascent to fame. I don't think my overall opinion was changed about Jobs himself, the book pretty much painted him the way the press and other accounts have for many years. I don't think that was ever too important to Jobs to be loved by all...though we all appreciate his contribution of great products and design. That was his real purpose in life.
0143117564|1.0|I was really shocked reading this book.  I kept waiting for the punchline - 'ha this wasn't written by pynchon' or 'joke's on you.'  I'm a huge fan of Pynchon.  Loved V, Vineland, Crying of Lot 49, ... even Mason Dixon (gravity's rainbow is a whole another conversation).  I pre-ordered and counted down the days until publication of this book.  Man , was I disappointed.  This is like a cheap knock-off of Pynchon or the ikea version of an eames chair.  Cliff Notes feels less derivative and one dimensional than this.  I guess Pynchon is showing his age.
1609611543|4.0|I leaned a lot from this book on wheat, and how the modern version can do loads of mischief in many folks' systems (digestive, cardiovascular, etc.). I've been off of wheat, rye, barley, and even oats (because they are often contaminated by wheat, in the field or in processing) for the last 15 months because of intestinal issues that resolved in a few days when I removed gluten from my diet. My reading of \\"Wheat Belly\\" was to learn as much as I could about wheat's effects on the human body, and the book does that very well.<br /><br />While the material on wheat takes up most of the book's pages, Dr. Davis does near the end make recommendations on what to eat, given that wheat is off the table. Here he largely ignores decades of research and clinical observations concerning the effects of consuming meat and high-fat dairy on health. He essentially takes the position popularized by the Atkins diet--unlimited protein and fat, minimal carbohydrates--with the proviso that it's crucial to completely eliminate wheat.<br /><br />However, while the material on wheat is explained and justified in (sometimes excruciating) detail, his other dietary advice is offered with little or no supporting material--material that it most assuredly needs.<br /><br />I'm with Dr. Davis on his main points about wheat, but part company with him on his other dietary advice. Quite frankly, there is no reason that someone cannot do quite well on a gluten-free, vegan diet. I do.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I don't have the time or interest in gaming 24/7, but I do like to play sometimes.  Unfortunately. for most games of this nature you cant get past the first screen w/o investing hours.  I was thrilled to be able to make progress everytime I played even if it was for a mere 20 min.  The scenery was beautiful,  like a fairy tale.  I loved the changing seasons.

0670014893|4.0|All of Le Carre's late novels pivot around his revulsion for State Corporatism, which he defines as the privatization of the public good for personal gain.  He can slide into a hectoring voice, but here he mostly reins in his outrage and produces a solid, thought-provoking thriller about Bush-Blair era government cowboys presiding over a botched operation against global terrorism.<br /><br />This is a joint operation on Gibraltar to capture an Al Queda operative.  The British are there in official capacity to provide legal cover, sending in some soldiers and Kit Probyn, a middling diplomat on the verge of retirement.  The British quarterback is Quinn, an ambitious New Labour politician, who is in turn being directed by a Crispin, a shadowy British entrepreneur.  The Americans will do the dirty work, and in true American fashion, have outsourced the operation to a private corporation, funded by a right-wing, evangelical Texas billionaire.<br /><br />Probyn, though on the ground at the time, did not truly see what happened, but is assured all went swimmingly.  A more disturbing version emerges when Probyn meets up with Jeb, one of the British soldiers who was there as well.  Jeb tells Probyn that innocent bystanders were mistakenly killed by the American mercenaries, and no terrorist was captured.  This version of events is given added weight when Probyn is contacted by Toby Bell, executive assistant to the politician Quinn when Quinn was secretly executing the Gibraltar op.<br /><br />The tension in the novel comes from the attempts by Bell/Probyn/Jeb to get the truth out, and the equally determined efforts of Crispin and the British Government to keep the lid on. The most chilling parts describe the new Kafka-like legal justifications used to effectively remove a citizen's legal rights in the name of state security.  As you might expect with Le Carre, the good guys wear grey, not white, and happy endings just aren't on in these morally ambiguous climes.<br /><br />In a strange way, Le Carre's skill as a novelist in a Delicate Truth undermines the seriousness and urgency of his message.  A novel climaxes and ends.  The assault on our civil liberties by self-interested politicians continues.  In Britain and America, neither our voters, nor our politicians nor our press have been able to prevent the fabrication of new laws to justify lawlessness in the name of counter terrorism.n a strange way, Le Carre's skill as a novelist in a Delicate Truth undermines the seriousness and urgency of his message.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A marvelous story of faith, hope and love! Bravery and a love for the United States that has come far to rarely in our politically correct world!  God bless Adam Brown and his family.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Very easy read, very entertaining - but the book ended very abruptly - very unsatisfactorily - just like a soap opera on Friday afternoon!
B005VPXNV2|5.0|Great movie. James Caan isgrat but Kathy Bates is the movie. A movie thatdoes the book justice. One of my favorite Steven King.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so glad I looked into this book series although I don't normally go \\"sci-fi\\". It was very well rated and had good consumer reviews. What a great set of characters the author created, especially Juliette.  The plot was well tied together which means a lot to me. Left me guessing how it would turn out while I rooted for the good guys to win. Although it is based on an apocalyptic story line where survivors don't know earth as it is today, that was just a backdrop to the humanistic part of the story. When I finished this book, I immediately ordered the other books in this series. I plan on enjoying my Memorial holidays with good reading material from Mr. Howey.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is just amazing one of the best I have played the only issue is the money but other than that this zombie game is phenomenal. I really recommend that you at least try it if not buy it
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Fast paced, fun, feeling of rpg style progression via upgrades, 10000000 has it all. This is hands down the best match style game I've played, but, as mentioned earlier, not so great name.
B00COGXX7A|2.0|The characters were emotionless and bland. Loved the plot twist but not enough to recommend the film. Why would anyone make a film where the audience is so disrespected? The act of falling in love should be passionate and messy and well - fun. This movie is none of those things.
B004UID2LC|3.0|My grandson uploaded this on my phone or kindle, not sure which.  I do not use it and was not happy that he was able to download
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Honestly one of the worst films in human history. You need a translator because all the characters just mumble and ramble on about we'll- nothing.

B00CFOXBX2|4.0|This started out slow; so slow I almost fell asleep. It did pick up and after the story line started to develop, it was fairly entertaining. I figured out what was happening pretty quickly, but still watched to see how the characters would change and take back their lives. As I said, it's predictable, but overall I was happy with the ending.

1852691263|5.0|I just love this book. It is one of my favorites. I love the author Eric Carle. All of his books are wonderful, and the illustrations are very creative.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I usually stick to word games, but this is an excellent game with many levels to challenge you as you become adept at it. I haven't read any factual information on this, but I feel that it sharpens my aging baby boomer brain, causing it to find new pathways and think outside the box so to speak. And the free version comes with hundreds of puzzles at increasingly challenging levels.  The games format beautifully on both the Amazon Fire and the iphone 5, without a single bug.  Kudos to Big Duck for this ingenius game.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This is a movie that you really have to watch twice because it has so many characters and switches from one time frame to another. But it was not too bad of a story and most of the stars in the show played quite a few different characters. Some you can tell who it is and others..keeps you guessing.
B009CV7IIA|5.0|Phenomenal!  Couldn't put it down!  Don't waste another minute looking for a new book to read!  Now hopefully the movie industry can bring it to life on the big screen and do the book justice.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is one of Tom's better movies. We liked it much better than the last few he has made. Most of the scenes were pretty real looking unlike most of the movies today that are so fake looking. Another story line that keeps you guessing as to why and who?

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Excellent show season 8 isn't a let down either this show could never end and I would be very happy
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|If you could take the mask off this movie you would find something or someone you are not looking for. A mixed up identity of an action flix. But dress it up and people believing it is something or someone else will sit and watch until the reveal when they realize they spent 2 hours watching watching the wrong movie disguised as the better one
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis -- well what can you say about him.  I've seen Brando, Steward, Fonda and a whole more -- he's the greatest I've seen -- I think.  Love Tommy Lee Jones.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my better ideas and am very well satisfied with it.  I now can play my solitaire games in the comfort and warmth of my bed.  The games are enticing and a challenge for me.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|I don't like the use of bad words, and it seems that this is the center of the movie, most of the time!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Don't have twenty words to discribe a battery but want you to know I am pleased with the purchase.  I haver the timer set to let me know how much battery is left for me to use when needed.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series so so good you'll wish it'd never end.  A great way to enjoy some history while being able to see how the rich lived.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Enjoy reading this classic and also have the movie to go along with it so understand it well.  Will purchase again
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Totally loved this movie!!!<br />Good acting, good plot, great special effects!!<br />If you are an old time Star Trek fan ( I used to hurry home to watch Star Trek and Voyage to the Bottom Sea, when in grade school) and you want more of the same, then this movie is probably not for you. Stay home and live in the past. That's ok. I understand. I collect DVD's and have many black and whites, as well as color films, from my past, and I love them!! I collect DVD's and Blu- Rays. I have over 700, so far.<br />But if you are willing to \\"Go where no one has gone before\\" then get this movie!!! JJ Abrams rocks!!! Best Sci Fi action adventure flick ever made, so far.<br />I embrace the present and the future of movie making. I enjoy remembering my past ( I own all the past Star Trek DVD's) but I am always ready to embrace my present and future.<br />But if you want to remember the past and have difficulty embracing the present and future of movie making, then this may not be a movie for you.<br />It's true that JJ Abrams has updated and given Star Trek a new feel, so to speak. But that is what movies are all about these days. Life has moved forward! Technology has moved forward! And so have movies!!<br />Embrace it and enjoy it!<br />My wife and I go to movies to escape and get away from it all. And we love a movie that knocks our socks off!! And this movie is it!!<br />My wife is a big fan of \\"Iron Man, Avengers, Thor, Transformers,\\" but when we left the theater after seeing this movie, we went and got tickets and saw it again, right away!!!<br />She looked at me and said \\"You know, I think I love this better than \\"Iron Man\\"!!<br />Our bodies may have aged to where we are in our 50's. But our hearts and minds are still in our 20's!! We are so glad to be alive when we can truly see technology unfold in front of us. Even when we go to the movies!!
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I would not have wanted to see this in theaters, but at home on my couch, I think it was good. As my headline suggests, the movie is very predictable, but I like to predict sometimes. The films simplicity was what I needed. I liked Cameron Diaz's character. She was dramatic and goofy. It was an easy movie for an actor/actress, but hey, it was nice. I believed the storyline, if only for one night.
B0000042MY|5.0|Awesome soundtrack... love &#34;Promentory.&#34;  Loved the movie, had to have the soundtrack for my vehicles stereo systems.  I play it all the time.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I began reading this book with slight skepticism that the tone wouldn't be original enough to be amusing. I was, happily, wrong. Tina Fey's humor and personality (I can confidently say without having ever met her) is anything but unoriginal or uninspiring. I loved this read and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a week's worth of simple entertainment for the sake of being entertained.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|D dumb stupid with internet and so much spell ,to force me to get a dictionary I is banal at the least
B00992CF6W|5.0|We need more updates. Make more to make this more Awesome.we need the nether portal ender portal.  Make gender men. Wolf's . Toby games
B005ZV8Q2S|1.0|Selected this after watching Bateman in Switch - and wanted more of the same. It ain't! This is raunchy like &#34;Bad Santa,&#34; catering to male adolescents, with female nudity and sticking fingers up peoples' bums. To add insult to injury, it appears that I accidentally hit the &#34;buy&#34; instead of &#34;rent&#34; - so I wasted even more money than I had intended. And I couldn't stand to watch beyond the porno flick scene, so it doesn't even deserve the one star!
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|I used this on my Fire Kindle 8.9 HD.  It works great and keeps the Kindle working at top shape!
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Great new album from lady antebellum! Classic sound with new twists. If u like this band u will love this new album
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I never miss Archer's books and order them as soon as they are available.  Really got into this trilogy and couldn't wait to get my hands on each succeeding book.  The first was the best by far, the last was my least favorite but it's a personal preference and isn't meant to detract from his writing.  If you like epics that follow families through many years, you'll enjoy this trilogy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The plot flows quickly andthe reader is quickly engaged.  The author created a wonderful drama that kept me interested and at times on the edge of my seat. I loved that I always thought about the story when I had to put it down to do other things.  The author does a very good job developing the pesonality of the characters. I can't wait to see the movie.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A game of thrones is a book based on the lives of several people through the events of one kingdom. Bran Stark, Catelyn Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Eddard Stark, and Daenerys Targaryen. The book is called Game of Thrones due to a battle for the throne of the land in the past, and the battle that will be in the near future.<br /><br />The Starks have a saying, \\"Winter is Coming,\\" because in this land, while this current summer has lasted years, normally summers are short, and winters are brutally long. Winter is coming for all those in this land, and they'd better be ready.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is an interesting book. If you're not used to jumping POV's, this book might not be for you. All of the people I mentioned above each get their own chapters in the book, and it switches POV from chapter to chapter. For example, one chapter will be Catelyn's, and the next will be Jon's POV. Having read a different series that had a tendency to do this, I wasn't bothered.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is an epic book. And I mean epic as in, epic sagas of the past (i.e. Beowulf). The books are a massive undertaking, each being around 1000 pages each, but it's a super quick read. George R.R. Martin is an amazing story-teller, and I can't wait to get into the second book, A Clash of Kings.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The story demonstrates nitty griity aspects of very dysfunctional relationships.  It also show that love can prevail and people can learn to live with each other, even when everything is  hanging in a fragile balance.  Some of the sad but real results of addiction are also highlighted but with time and hard work, the characters get down to real feelings.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This an excellent action movie. As a long fan of Lee Child's character Jack Reacher I was originally appalled at the selection of TC to play Reacher. After reading favorable reviews I decided to take a chance. Cruise pulls it off with style. He's believable and that's what's important. Great cast too.
B0007939NO|5.0|This movie never gets old.  The dancing and singing is as good as it gets.  I have a soft spot in my heart for this musical as it was the first one I ever saw as a child.  The cover, CD and even shipping are all I would hope them to be.
B001TODO72|4.0|Fun Home by Alison Bechdel is a stellar example of a quintessential memoir. Set in rural Pennsylvania, Bechdel centers her memoir around her relationship with her closeted father, Bruce and how his hidden double-life was inextricably intertwined with hers.  As an autobiography, Alison Bechdel admits more about her family life than expected, rather than \\"setting the record straight\\" about her role as the only daughter in her family. This graphic novel is an autobiography very unlike its peers. Fun Home not only tells the reader eloquently about the protagonist's life in detail, it also shocks the reader multiple times by its brutal honesty. Few would be willing to admit as many hidden family secrets as the protagonist in this autobiography, Alison. Not only does the content satisfy the reader immensely, the art is breathtaking in its meticulous aspects. Her language and drawings are very sensitive to every part of his physical experience and her phases in and out of self-consciousness; Bechdel continuously delves into her past, plunging the reader into its depths every time. The memoir is not chronological, yet it focuses on each major incident by revisiting the topics from different angles. Bechdel's openness about her family's story along with her personal coming of age is what distinguishes her work from other novels I have read. I have never been taken aback so many times as with this novel. Bechdel interprets and reinterprets her relationship with her father and in turn, his relationship with their whole family, in terms of biblical, literary, and mythical stories. While this novel is certainly unconventional, it has a particularly shining moral. One of the most defining thoughts to be received from this memoir is the fact that no family is perfect, and that understanding our own families can take an emotional toll on all of our hearts.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said--It was great--Brought tears to everyone watching--Have watched several times and play the soundtrack on our MP3 players
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Loved the movie...  I have watched this movie many times and will never tire of it.  Beautifully filmed, especially in Africa, and marvelous acting by Audrey Hepburn et al.  Only thing I would change would be the ending... there should have been a sequel...
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Lots Of Action--Story moves along nicely--We all really enjoyed it--Thanks to Prime we were able to see it for free-
B004GJXQ20|4.0|An interesting romp through a mediaeval kingdom full of lust and backstabbing intrigue. Oh, and dragons, so that was nice.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|it works, its blurry and slow, doesnt always load up everything at the same time, I had to load it a couple of times before I got the whole page...
