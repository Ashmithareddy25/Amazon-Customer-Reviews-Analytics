B0091QS88K|1.0|it doesnt even give you intructons how to play the game i got lost so i deleted the gamefrom my tablet
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fabulous settings, so well acted it makes you forget it's not real, you care about all the characters, good and bad, gorgeous costumes, fast moving plots and lots of subplots, intrigue, and drama, what's not to love?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Entertaining to the whole family, thought provoking, an insight to<br />Stress Management in a Hostile Environment.  Thinking outside the box extreme.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Loved this book! It really opened our eyes on each others needs. I would recommend this book to every couple, regardless if you think you need help or not.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It has action, humor, and drama. I'm glad it is available on Amazon. I watch it with my whole family. I plan on watching all seasons. Thanks Amazon!
B0089XH38M|1.0|So, I downloaded this to my kindle fire because I use it for emails, etc and wanted some protection. I have AVG on my computer and it works wonderfully.  However, this is not the case for my kindle.  It locks up my kindle every time I use it.  Will be uninstalling.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|This book was good. I saw the movie before the book and the book is nothing like the movie. I thought the movie was better than the book.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|Got my wife the Nikon 1 J1 and the extra battery is essential for our weekend getaways throughout the state.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My granddaughter wanted a Barbie house for Christmas but I didn't want to spend a fortune.  I found this little gem on Amazon (4 days before Christmas).  It was reasonable priced and is very sturdy.  She loves it and I am happy that I could get her what she wanted and not break the bank.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Dear John Green,<br /><br />Thanks. It wasn't like I needed my heart anyway. Thank you for such a beautiful book. Off to read Looking for Alaska!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|One of those &#34;ordinary&#34; stories that turns out to<br />harbor quiet wisdom and surprising turns of events.<br />It stay with you.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is the best app you can get and you can change the Color of the battery so get this app or don't I don't care
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love Andrea Bocelli.  His voice is so beautiful, and &#34;Passione&#34; is a sheer delight.  It is one of my very favorite CDs second only to &#34;Vivere.&#34;
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is sooo fun, I love playing it. I usually play it everyday. My baby cousin likes it to.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|It is not often that I find a book that just sucks me in and demands to be read. This one does just that.  From the first chapter on it built the story, the world and my interest.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Love the series.  The DVD is of good quality and the fact that I got it free via amazon's streaming service is a huge plus.  If only Amazon instant video had subtitles!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|It's a great app. If you want to listen to your favorite singer or band, get this app. It's a great app and it's free
B005HEPJBY|4.0|Season 4 is when TNG got really good.  25 years later and these episodes are still quite watchable.  The only sad thing is that at this point this series has already lived half its life.
B004UQPM4E|3.0|Got the version with Spanish labels on the disc. Movie titles were written in small text around the edge which were easy to miss. Watched the movies and they're fine so I still gave it 3 stars. Not happy that this was not mentioned in the description. I was expecting the US version. I purchased mine from a2z.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I didn't get a chance to watch the movie.  I rented it but didn't watch it immediately not realizing it would become unavailable before my family and I got to it.  I don't know why it became unavailable or if/when it'll come back or if I'll get reimbursed for it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a great movie during the flight I was upside down and holding my breath.  Denzel did not over act his part.  It's hard to write a review without being a spoiler.  I would recommend this movie.  A  good story is hard to find these days that's simple most people can relate to or have gone though themselves.  Well done
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|eech. i quit watching after ther first 15 minutes. dumb, raunchy, juvenile, boring. good idea, bad writing, poor taste. don't waste your time. also, i never heard of an unrated movie. would be helpful to have an \\"r\\" there for parents.
B005L38QHA|5.0|This mouse is perfect for World of Warcraft as well as general macros. Compared to the many others I've tried, I give this one a 5 star.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show with a fast and interesting plot.  Interesting characters and compelling story. We'll keep watching till they're not making it anymore.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I really really loved this book it was hilarious and funny I can't wait for the next one .<br /><br />  Sincerely ,your biggest fan
B002ZG98J6|5.0|This is a truly awesome movie with really cool special effects, My family loved it from beginning to end. 5 stars all the way! *****
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book I would recommend this to anyone one who lives action suspense and romance. Great job to Suzanne Collins you did a great job in making this book a successful one. I have read this book before but it just isn't the same when I read it again I never want to put the book down.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Everyone just thinks this thing is the best. He is soooo cute! Out little boy loves it as well, though at 12 weeks, he is starting to associate it with bedtime and fights like no other! The only thing I worry about is how to wash it? The paci dos not disconnect from the stuffy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is the best game ever!! The Rome version is AWESOME because you get to find eggs, and if you get 100 eggs then you get the special edition chicky board. It's like a chicken that got turned into a board.
B006LSZECO|3.0|absolutely hated the ending and was very disappointed.  However, the author did a very nice job with her character portrayal.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|The doc is very well put together. Editing is great. The introduction to interviews to the story itself are all on par. You get a great understanding of who this person is and the mystery behind him and his music. The soundtrack is very good, all of Rodriquez's music, which is very good.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who is into docs, music, and stories with happy endings. &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; is one of those docs where you really wonder why things follow a certain path and not another. Maybe fate, maybe destiny, maybe just coincidence.<br />5 stars for a great story that are hard to come by these days.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic novel. I could not set it down! Even better reading it as a Hoosier from Indy with many cancer encounters. Touched my heart more than I could explain in words.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|The movie could have been better. Based off of, or rather inspired by real brothers, the movie lacks a little something extra. A great cast, big Tom Hardy fan although Guy Pierce steals the show. The movie definitely keeps your interest, but at times it seems like the story has been done a few times before. Some more depth in the story could've helped it some.<br />This movie is for anyone who is into those old time, good ole boy, action packed movies, this is for you.<br />3 stars for a good movie that could've used just a little more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I 've said before I prefer either a low intro price or a &quot;free trial &quot; because I have too many games.  purchased at full price only to find they weren't.what I was looking for and got sent to the cloud,  never to be played again.  Beside great graphics and spooky story, this is the 1st game I 'ge ever left the volume turned up on and it enhanced the game more than it drove me crazy.  Many HOG 's but they were fairly easy so I won't complain about the lack of a zoom.  They also gave you a choice between the hog's or playing a game of Monaco (a card game).  Also several good mini games.  Since I 'm still between a novice and a beginner,  I really appreciate the &quot;strategy guide &quot;. It really helps to avoid getting stuck.  Thanks G5!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Be warned: After you install Business Calendar Pro you can -NEVER- uninstall the Amazon appstore from your Android phone. It turns into Nagware, and you can's access the alerts that Business Calendar produces as part of the program. Great product - lousy distribution channel. The Amazon app stays memory-resident, eating up phone resources, and you can't kill it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|here are some words to describe this game:<br />cool rad awesome addictive cool rad awesome addictive cool rad awesome and last but not least addictive
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|If we all played a drinking game to most any Rihanna song, we'd all be WAY drunk and fast. How many times does she sing, &#34;Shine bright like a diamond&#34; in &#34;Diamonds&#34;? It's an annoyingly catchy song though. I like her voice okay. It's a level above most pop singers but very far below the Adeles and Christinas of the music industry. Rihanna, her producers and songwriters know how to appeal to the mainstream probably better than any other.  No chances taken but it can be irresistible at times.
B007RI56NY|3.0|The songs were ok but has a way to go to match their past hits. I tried it for the price, so it's ok.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is FANTASTIC. First thing I'm going to say. Great graphics, controls and gameplay. HOWEVER. I tried playing on multiplayer. I logged in successfully, but it won't let me actually play. HAYELP.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Well...myself as a brony i totally love this game but the way you get hearts i do think is hard.i cant get scootaloo DX.i also think that derpy hooves / ditzy doo should actually be buy able for like 1700 bits.again this is a great game overall from challenges and whatnot!
B00005JGAF|5.0|One of the greatest bands ever finishes their trilogy of perfection with Rocket to Russia.  Great liner notes tell the story of one of the greatest albums of all time.  You've never spent $7 on something better than this.
0307341577|3.0|Good story, weak writing. Too repetitive. It is a perfect mystery for a teenage girl, sans the foul language. For a woman of thirty's as myself it was just okay. I can say the same about the \\"Sharp Objects\\". Again, both great stories, great twists and I'm not disputing that, just made me feel a bit immature reading them.
B008YFALF2|5.0|received this quick.... couldnt find the other book we had from my first son and had to reorder this one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can someone make a review this to me. Imangi studios llp don't tell me. This review was made march first.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've never read a more perfect book. I would suggest it to anyone. It was a roller coaster of emotions, but it had to be the best roller coaster I've ever been on.
B005EHILV4|5.0|For under $50 for a mixer that also acts as an interface this product is great. been playing around recoriding using (Behringer C-1) and running sonar on the computer. quality is good. You can hear the feedback in in the headphones but it is minimal once reocrded on the computer. you have to play with volumes a little to get it just right. I have found that minimizing the gain with the mixer works well. I would reccomend it to anyone looking to just have a small setup. In all with cables, mic, and mixer spent under $100 and works well for what I'm doing(small end recording music)
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I saw my friend Alex playing it and I want it so badly but it wont download he wont le me play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is one of the finest games I've played. It is cool because it switches so many places like New York,Rio and Rome it so cool because you are not in the same place every time like temple you just stay in one place. Also I lobe subway surfer because the characters switch it just an amazing game. :))))
B004GYY714|4.0|Stations are easy to find. App is easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone debating downloading a radio app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this in one sitting. It is well-written and easy to read. Several of my students have read it and enjoyed it as well.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Heartthrob... fantastic songwriting that reminds me of 80's pop and a musical decade when each year yielded a dozen equally high caliber albums.  Add to that a perfect studio production that makes Tegan and Sara sound much better than they do in any of their live performances posted on YouTube.  Four songs ended up making it onto my iPod including the standout, four-star song \\"I was a fool\\" followed by three-star songs \\"I'm not your hero\\", \\"How come you don't want me\\", and \\"Shock to your system\\".
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I found myself saying over and over \\"I did not know that\\"....a remarkable portrait of a truly great man.  It was amazing to read how much the rivals came to respect and to love Lincoln.  A great read....underscoring the greatness of Lincoln.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks is such a gripping book that I just could not put down. I loved it so much. One of my new favorite books. Wonderful storyline, I am so glad I read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't watched the movies yet. I feel it's always better to read first. I loved the detail in this book. Some of it I wish were more detailed- what happened to end the Americas and the rest of the world for that matter. But it describes all of the necessary story line and leaves the reader wondering why Katniss hasn't quite grasped how Peeta feels. On occasion, it's hard to think of how young most of the characters are, considering their situations in life and their personal experiences, but then you are reminded again of how young and innocent they truly are despite being thrust into perils and first love on national television.
B000BISBDY|5.0|a american musical icon. still showed he had it with the rick rubin recordings.. 6 more words to go..done okay
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! New and different! The actors are supreme- well written- great plot! You should watch this series!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love it.  Love the additional data like wind speed and humidity.  This is very helpful prior to our bike rides.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a simple, no frills solitaire game where the cards are big enough to be seen.<br />There are a variety of settings to choose from and I like that as well.<br />When I feel the call to play solitaire, I just want to play solitaire and don't want the distraction of any animations. This fills the bill nicely.
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|Even though it is over four hours long, I liked it.  I was surprised how many big name actors kept appearing when you least expected it.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I've been in sales formally for the last 12 years, and when I put things in the perspective of To Sell Is Human, my whole life.  I've been through numerous sales trainings throughout my career and they always have felt like they missed the mark for one reason or another.  Solution Selling, for instance, gave a great framework to &#34;manage&#34; the sales cycle and to focus on doing the right thing for the customer, but it's almost as if it were afraid to go all the way and in the end, turns around to win for the seller (at least in the trainings I went through and the popular interpretation at my companies).<br /><br />Dan's articulation of a humility and service based sales effort to move others, focusing on the customers' winning more than  the seller is refreshing.  It's largely what I have focused on in my own efforts much to the confusion of others around me.  It's made my work more purposeful than ever and allowed me to concentrate on my own mission, which is helping my clients flourish in achieving theirs.<br /><br />I hope many many people read this and Dan's other books, and put them into practice. We can each make a small dent, and together, make the world a much better place.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This application is quite handy for anyone with basic needs. If you're looking for a scientific calculator this one is not for you. But a basic calc it is great.
B000UCYER8|5.0|this one was for me, attempting to improve my writing skills for school. So far so good its a quick read and has been very helpful.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The graphics are amazing. The story line is just complex enough to keep you interested, but simple enough not to have unresolved parts at the end of the game. It also had a good balance of puzzles to hidden objects.<br /><br />However, there seemed to be a large number of spiders in the game. Including one you have to interact with to move forward.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Awesome tale of a local kid beating the odds.<br />Great characters and relationships.<br />You will recognize many of these actors.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love all the different choices! The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because it takes a while to earn enough points for a new game to be unlocked.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Coolest app ever . W wished I knew more about horses to rate this app.  So so so so awesome! Bye.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|If you love or even just somewhat like progressive rock--get this album now. If you like progressive jazz (circa Miles Davis electric period)=ditto. Buy it now without hesitation.<br /><br />If the \\"prog scene\\" isn't your thing, you should still give this a spin because it is one of the most intense albums in years, layered with brilliant textures.<br /><br />Two of these ghost stories--both the words and music--are among some of the most beautiful musical pieces on the subject of loss. Two of the songs--\\"Luminol\\" and \\"The Holy Drinker\\" kick ass! They are flights of jamming to rival King Crimson at their best.<br /><br />The more I listen to this album the more I feel it is one of the best I have heard in the last few years.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so easy to get sucked into.  My co-workers and friends would talk about it frequently, and I thought &#34;meh, zombies.&#34;<br /><br />Never again.............
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I'm not a huge movie buff, but I love watching Denzel in just about anything.  One of his best performances IMO.  I didn't know much about this movie except for the 30 second trailer on TV, so I was truly shocked at the real story line.  Great anti-hero plot.  I was sucked in from the opening scene.  Not for the faint of heart!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The characters here really drew you in. I enjoyed how the book made you feel the story of Catnis, her family and all the others. Their struggle to survive the internal struggles they faced, The character depth was well developed as well I felt as though I knew the main characters in this book. I would recommend this to others, though reading the entire series is a must.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomest game EVER I cant put it down. If you don't already have this game you have to get it. Not a rip off as some people say. Awesome prides,other charecters, boars, and way more. I f you want to know more about this awesome game GET IT YOURSELF ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Buy it today.
B0063GORYU|5.0|What? Not on my desktop computer? Shut the front door! No seriously.  I love this app.  Pop ups don't bother me . Its only one and BETWEEN games. No interruptions. Well meant advice: if you insist on no ads in ANY app you should pay for the ad free version.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I couldn't put the book down .I\\"'ve read 4of Nelson DeMille\\"s books and by far this was the best. I bought The Lion and I\\"m reading that next.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  Now I can watch whenever I feel like it, don't have to wait until it comes on tv.  Nostalgic and funny no matter how many times you view.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as much suspense as in the first book, and somewhat predictable.  I didn't go on to the last book after reading this.
6305041156|5.0|This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. I almost wept at the beauty of it. I fully fully fully demand you see it.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|i really like nickelback and their music that they dont play on the radio. this is a really good cd.
0790729725|5.0|Everything about this movie works. Ray Liotta deserved an Oscar nomination and this film is way better and more memorable than &#34;Dances With Wolves&#34;. It's a must for fans of the genre
B0007XT7V8|5.0|i love toadm and this cd is awesome. you can really tell how good they really are by their older cds.
B002AF4Y9G|4.0|If Scarface was written when Oliver Stone was on cocaine, this movie must have been written and made when Stone was on more hardcore drugs. It is absolutely insane and crazy. It's hyper, over-violent and very stylistic. Not for everyone, but it is pure 90's
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|i bought this for my husband and he loves it. The new songs are really good and you catch on quickly!
B0002B15WE|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said. This film changed action films for better and for worse. I showed this to my siblings when they were (ages 11, 6 and 9). They were on the edge of their seat and they loved every minute of it. If their review says anything, it says that this film still packs the punch that it had in it's initial release
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I really like this cd. its good and i would deffently buy this again. shipped out pretty fast too. :
B00005YU1O|5.0|This philosophical film is comprised of vignettes that are only conversations about life, love and thought and politics. Even if these conversations mean nothing, they are highly interesting and the animation style fits in perfectly with the lucid tone of the film
B004EPYZQC|5.0|My husband really liked this movie. the likes all the fast and furious movies and this was one of his favotires.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This movie is a knockout. The amazing cast mixed in with the directing style of Robert Rodriguez (excluding his family stuff) and Tarantino, this is how a graphic novel should look on the big screen, and little screen
B005K0HDGE|5.0|But then I have loved most of what Stephen King has done.  I can really related to his music and the visual images his words create.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|While this movie is a great deal &#34;Style over substance&#34;, the sheer beauty of the film will keep you on the edge of your seat
B009HELT3C|5.0|I was expecting much less so was pleasantly surprised with how good they actually made it. The characters were just as funny as in the previous ones though Tommy Lee Jones's body double was a bit to good for this older gentleman. Over all it was great fun and full of laughs, just what you would expect from this all star cast.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Lars von Trier might not be a great person, but he makes a good movie. This film looks and feels like a stage performance. There is no set, but rather the outline of where the set would be. All the actors give it there all and it is an experience.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Still trying to actually figure out how to set it up best and broadcast everything but this is an issue on my end with no training and such in this type of thing.
0790731509|5.0|My favorite Paul Newman movie. He is 100% badass and charming as Luke. It is in my top 10 favorite movies of all time
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love this series.  I originally watched it on NetFlix and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to be able to watch it whenever I chose to, and have access to subtitles as well.  I am watching it now.  I love the quality and cleverness of the packaging.  This should store well for years to come.  Thank you!
B00005JKES|3.0|This is a quintessential 90's show and a must for fans of nostalgic television, but the pilot is NOT included. You must order it separately. This goes for ALL season one packs. Had it been included, 4 stars
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I read a review of this movie long before I was able to see it.  The review was not at all favorable.  I suspected, and now know, the reviewer did not know what they were talking about!  I love these wonderful British actors and have many of their individual movies.  I believed this movie had to be good - very good - and I was right.  Loved it and watched it twice, back to back.  Maggie Smith, you rock!
B00009QG68|5.0|One of the best sequels of all time and one of the best science fiction movies ever made. James Cameron can make a damn fine movie when he wants.
B00136NUG6|5.0|This album (shows my age) brings back so many memories!  Dances,  Skating,  Proms.  Now its the music I'm playing while cleaning and doing the wash....but it makes me move...and smile!  I'm loving this music all over again!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This movie is beautiful. It's how a western should be. Sergio Leone is a master at the Spaghetti Western, this film cemented that fact in everyone's mind.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Russell Crow is a fat pervert.  Lucy Lu is a whore and this new person with no talent is obviously sing  kung fu hustle to himself through the whole movie.
B00104QSOM|4.0|While I am not a fan of the paper-like case, this movie once again highlights the extreme talent of Daniel Day-Lewis and P.T. Anderson's tight writing. This was the best movie of 2007,
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When I purchased this, I got it for 19.99.  Best Price Ever.  I don't have a 3D TV at the moment, but seriously, who wouldn't pay the extra $5 to get it 3D capable for when 3D TVs are lower priced?  The movie itself is fantastic, Joss Whedon is a genius, the cast is great.  The movie is always entertaining, and The Hulk stole the show.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Arguably one of the best Bond movies since the days of Connery. Perfect for those who love Bond, or just movies in general
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I've heard 50/50 on this item.  Some people it works excellent for them and its one of the coolest things they've bought for their system.  It didn't work for me, as soon as I put it on the Kinect it no longer registered the device.  I'm sure it is great when it works.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I was in awe with the technical marvels of this film. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. It is a gorgeous film. My favorite silent film with Chaplin's &#34;Modern Times&#34;.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Okay so I didn't listen to it.  I've never heard of it, nor did I listen to it once I bought it for a friend.  He however was thrilled and went home and listened to it, said it was fantastic.  So if you like the artist, based on my friend's response, this is a good one.
B000F7OMZ2|3.0|Not the best Indiana Jones by a long-shot, but still much better than the 4th one. Stick with Last Crusade and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Not a bad movie, just doesn't get a full recommendation.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book, I read it on two sittings. Highly recommended. The innocence of the main character and the way the story was written through letters make you connect on a real personal level. I'd say it should be part of high school curriculum
B00005JKN9|4.0|This movie doesn't feel like a Scorsese movie. It has some weird editing, but I love period pieces and Daniel Day-Lewis goes all out and gives a great performance. Not Scorsese's best by a mile and a half, but a damn fine film
B005LZW8FO|2.0|This movie is not science fiction. The laws of physics are thrown out the window. Human nature on a large scale is ignored. It contains scenes that add nothing to the movie. Just when it starts getting interesting, it ends.<br /><br />  *****************Spoilers***************<br /><br />Physics: There is no way you could have another planet that close without disrupting everything on both planets from the gravitational effect. How did the other planet get there anyway? Where is its sun?<br /><br />How does the little kid get thrown forward out of the car, through the windshield when they were sitting still at the time of the accident? Did the force disintegrate the seatbelt it shows him wearing?<br /><br />Human nature: Anyone heard about the story when War of the Worlds was broadcast in 1938? While there is debate how much panic actually happened, a world travelling towards ours, close enough to view detail through an old telescope? Yeah, that wouldn't be pretty.<br /><br />Extraneous scenes: The magic colored man added nothing to the movie (I'm not sure what nationality he was. It was unclear.) That entire section could have been cut. Her attempted suicide had no effect other than some bandages on her fingers, and was never mentioned again. No therapy, no health issues, nothing. Laying naked in the snow to the point you look dead has more health effects than that.<br /><br />So after sitting through all the boring angst, the horrifying relationship she forms with him, etc, the girl gives the guy her ticket to the other earth (not sure why the company would allow that, she won a contest, it was big publicity.) Then four months later, she's coming around the side of a house, and sees her other self standing by the garage. The end. WTF?<br /><br />I should have known better than to watch a Sundance film without reading reviews first.<br /><br />It would have been a much, much better movie if they had just left out the \\"science\\" fiction part. Then the people who likethis kind of movie would have seen it, and the rest of us would have been spared.<br /><br />One star for the superb acting even if the movie was meh, one star for the awesome saw music. (the rest of the music in the movie was very good as well)
B00003CXB2|5.0|Petere O'Toole deserves an Oscar victory. This movie is beautiful. David Lean is at the top of his game. Watch it on a huge screen.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I received my KIndle as a gift in 2009.  Recently, I found that the charging cable was fraying and cracking.  I did an on-line chat with Amazon customer service.  The representative I dealt with was great.  We got all the basic information taken care of quickly and he told lme they were sending me a replacement cable at no charge.  I was concerned there might be a difference in the cable because of the newer models that have come out.  Not a problem.  I received the replacement in two days and it works perfectly.  My thanks to Amazon for addressing my issue so quickly and I was certainly very happy that they didn't even charge me!  That's what I call really standing behind your product.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Maybe it is the best war movie ever. If not, definitely the best Vietnam war movie ever made. Full Metal Jacket is a close second
0240815807|3.0|Let me start off by saying, I'm still in college and want to do mixes just for fun. Meaning that, I'm totally inexperienced which lead this professionally written book completely useless to me. So after reading the Introduction part, which the author explained that this book is not written for amateurs, I decided to skim over and found out that it's exactly not for me. Please realize this before buying, it's professional's \\"Small Studio\\", not Amateur's \\"Cheap Small Studio\\".<br /><br />1. Concepts after concepts, I just don't see what to do with them. I'm an engineering major and I know physics and fundamental recording techniques. Still, I feel like reading my Electromagnetic textbook... Only harder to understand, because it's beyond just physics.<br /><br />2. Even it's for small studios, I'm still out of budget. This book spend one entire part (part 1 of 4), explains that \\"you need to get a nice and more expensive monitor, otherwise you won't know what you are doing.\\" I agree, but I'll stick with my old JBL, no plans on upgrading any gear. (especially that JBL makes outstanding speakers even if those turn old) I'm still in college, and I'm cheap.<br /><br />3. After the monitor section, this book gets serious... I mean serious... Chapter 4 called \\"from subjective impressions to objective results\\", which explained exactly that. ONLY IN CONCEPT. Other chapters are alike, explaining Hi-end theory only. I just have vocal, lead and rhythm guitar tracks to deal with, I can hardly find anything useful unless I'm more experienced in this industry. More importantly, I want my mix to sound decent instead of problematic, not commercial grade instead of decent. I believe that's the difference.<br /><br />Anyway, I have a lot more respect in the author and the industry, mixing is harder and more complicated than I thought it was. It's not just tricks, but concepts you have to understand prior to the tricks or secrets you can apply on your mixes. I learned it.<br /><br />I recommend this book to small studio professionals, it will definitely help you mix commercial grade music in small studio. On the other hand, if you are doing this for fun, and want to keep it fun, cheap and not seeking to make money out of it. It is not written for you, you will have to get familiar with this industry first in order to understand and apply these principals.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />UPDATE： Latter on I figured that one of the \\"For Dummies\\" Book called, Home Recording For Musicians, is a better book written for beginners. (Especially for people who don't work in a professional studio)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It very repetitive.The unlocks cost too much money.Still fun though.you can compete with your friends.I think you should play it.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|You hear the stuff in the news but this is from the source. A good read but a little of the same debauchery over an  over...yet this was his life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun and entertaining game. When I first got it was the only game I played, that is still the case now. The fact that they added the works your it just takes it to a whole new level forrealsies!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|A little amaturish, but overall, not that bad. A little hard to find some items, which ultimately is what made the game a bit challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is the best touch screen game ever made its fun and addicting. I also like the world tour. Keep up with the success.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I thought the movie was great. It was a story of determination and strength regardless to obstacles. This is a must see
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.It beat temple run.subway sutures is the best-selling game ever.My favorite game in the whole world.watching tailers of new worlds
B000FA5TTW|5.0|When I first began reading the book, I felt like she was too young. Though her adolescence remains with her throughout the book, I find that she ages appropriately, and the main character grows on me.<br /><br />The book was perfectly suspenseful, and character development was done well for most of the family members with the exception of the enigmatic mother. I probably just disliked her.<br /><br />I don't intend to review the book thoroughly, but I would like to give it five stars and recommend it to other readers.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A book that truly made me laugh from page one. One of the few books that can be judged by its cover and its reviews .<br /><br />Funny and intelligent at the same time!
0440241901|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's stand alone novels.  This was such a good book.  Emma is very relatable and I loved her.  The story line is very easy to get sucked into.  I can't wait to read another Sophie Kinsella book.
B0093LINVK|4.0|I needed a small, quiet machine for a studio DAW.  The NUC does what I need, though I wish it had USB3.0 and an eSATA port.
B00821PCJS|4.0|A well done made for television science fiction experience.  Good special effects, a good story and good acting.  I recommend it!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I love the book.  Free shipping costs to much for the book. I love the book so much I want marry it.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|An intense, dark drama which does justice to the DC comic tradition!  Maybe too intense for younger children.  I recommend it!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Sometimes it feels like Netflix, as a company, isn't always playing with a full deck of cards, but I can assure you they got a full house here.  House of Cards is a fantastic television show. I use the word television loosely since you won't actually find this on any  network station. Kevin Spacey stars as Francis \\"Frank\\" Underwood, a US Congressman who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He knows the end to his means, we don't, but it's a joy to find out.<br /><br />The show is steeped in politics, but in many ways it's merely a vehicle for its excellent character-driven story. At the heart of the show is power. Some people have it, and others want it. On multiple occasions,  I'd be watching an episode, with Frank wheeling and dealing, or sending his \\"muscle\\" out to do a job, and I'd question whether I was watching a political drama, or The Sopranos. It truly does play out like a mob-family drama at times. A frightening thought when you realize the show has many parallels with our real-life political system.<br /><br />The acting overall is superb, but Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are especially outstanding in this, the best they've ever been I feel.  The first season also features a number of extraordinary directors, including the masterful David Fincher ([[ASIN:B0034G4P7Q The Social Network]], [[ASIN:B001992NUQ Fight Club]], [[ASIN:B001BPQT8A Seven]]), who directed 2 episodes, as well as  Joel Schumacher, and James Foley ([[ASIN:B002NNA9N0 Glengarry Glen Ross]]). I just hope the real-world politics of television don't stop this show from getting the Emmy nominations it clearly deserves.<br /><br />It's not TV, It's not even HBO, it's Netflix and you should be watching it.  The Show will also be released on Blu-ray and DVD later this year.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A complex story line and good acting.  As with &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; a nice compliment to the DC comic tradition.
888370536X|5.0|Not only have I had mine for more years than I can remember, during its days of heavy-duty service, this little sucker was always there when I needed it, and (if you use the right kind of lead) it faithfully \\"held\\" my musical ideas. Especially good for writing down melodic phrases, off-the-cuff transcriptions, simple chord charts (though not for jazz charts, as you really only have room for two bars per stave), and just generally excellent at capturing those fleeting moments of inspiration when you would otherwise look for an envelope or napkin while sitting a keyboard. This sucker never fell apart on me, in spite of the three years I carried it with me daily, spilled beer on it, played from it like a fake book at gigs, and worked within it as a composer and arranger. Don't expect huge expanses of space, but, if you know you need a piece of manuscript paper with you always (one that will never get lost or destroyed like the rest of the matchbooks and napkins in your jacket pocket), then this little badass is for you. Highly recommended.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Well let see it's very,very,Swag...luv see what's my friends & family,sport stars,music artists and just what trends are rocking enough said.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where they find her body in a ditch somewhere!<br /> While I almost fell for this romaticized version of this sexual world, the over the top ending stopped me cold. Christian reveals himself to be a completely violent sociopath. Just another story of \\"good girl tries to change bad boy who's just misunderstood\\" and gets her heart (and some of her body) broken in the process. From the previews of the next 2 books I assume they  get together again and eventually get married, I won't be a part of it.<br />I couldn't finish without saying I found the most interesting character to be Taylor, Christian's aide-driver-body guard. I really wondered what his backstory was and how he got mixed up with a nutjob like Grey. Alas, it's not worth slogging through 2 more editions are such purple tripe to find out. I'm done.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Has given me hours of fun. Just right when you need an escape from the same old same old.  I RECOMMEND FOR YOUNG AND OLD.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Fantastic story of finding oneself through nature which is the closets to our God we can find here on earth.
0896898288|5.0|I'm an avid quilter and a farmer so the stories in this book appeal to my sensiblities.  Times have changed but the old ways and values are still wonderful.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game has great graphics and effects! It was fun and not too difficult. If you enjoyhidden object games, I recommend this one for sure.
1451695195|5.0|this read is one to make you reconsider many things in this life.  I was first intrigued by the fact that this man lives in the same area where I call home territory and that he is willing to tell his story so that others may have this information from his experience.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Everything about this splendid box set is a keeper - with the exception of the missing series finale for Season Two. As the box set credits proudly proclaim it to contain the \\"Uncut U.K. Version\\", perhaps this last episode (running time of 1:38) was not broadcast as part of the Second Season in the U.K., but as a stand-alone broadcast.<br /><br />In any event, I returned my box set, as it doesn't make much sense to be completely enthralled in the second season only to have to find the finale on iTunes!<br /><br />p.s. I must give Amazon due credit, as they were very quick to respond to my email and issued a full credit to my account immediately.
B0080MJYR0|4.0|This movie is a classic of the 60s. Even with the advent of modern movie technology, it still marvels with the imagination shown when it was created. The story may be silly but never pretends it isn't. Very creative and fun. This would have been five stars except the HD and playability were less than some other restorations.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|Healthcare recipients in the U.S. pay extraordinary prices for goods and services related to their health.  They have the right to know who is behind the training of their doctors, the research and development of new drugs, and the regulation of the industry.  This book provides that information, so that consumers can make better decisions about their healthcare.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After the first two, it's a bit of a disappointment.  Rather than building excitement, it just sort of winds down predictably.  More teenage angst than actual drama.  Sort of like the publishers said there had to be three books, so the author just kept writing until the proper number of pages had been filled.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app ever.wish I found it earlier. :)<br />this app was great and I hope more come out
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my five brothers and sisters.  Each one wrote me and said how much they absolutely love it.  I've heard it and feel that it's one of his all time bests.
B00006RIO7|1.0|This CD skips so much that there is barely a song on it that doesn't skip. I was hugely disappointed as I love the music from this movie/show. I would have sent it back, but I couldn't see spending more money on it. On a positive note, it did arrive quickly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I give this game 5 stars because it's so cool but there is not really a point In the game<br />But just for peps who like building or like playing with zombie or something<br />So any way I think you guys should get the game Minecraft........p.s you should<br />Get the first one first then get this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing!! Cant wait for nxt update!!! I recomend this app to everyone!! Time for me to play some more!!! Thank u for making this app!!
B0030T1NAO|5.0|My Husband and I finished the entire 2nd season in two days.  Each episode leaves you hungry for just one more like one sugary treat!  Just can't get enough!!!
B00B9DTZWG|5.0|Excellent & captivating- gave it to my daughter as a Valentines gift- she runs a business with hours preventing her from seeing the show on TV- she doesn't want to stop watching after each episode.
0757302661|2.0|Good lord, I don't have time for all this. I counted about 10 pages of actual instruction for how to practice and employ self-hypnosis for birth. This is what I bought the book for, as I'm aiming for a natural birth and I've heard good things from friends who've used self-hypnosis, but by the time you get to those goodies you're too numb or bored to care. Also, as someone who is not put off or frightened by the clinical terms conventionally used to describe various aspects of birth, I found the alternative (supposedly gentler) language the book insists you adopt to be very annoying and distracting. This book would be much better as a pamphlet, or just a DVD with multimedia instructions and practice aids.<br /><br />If you're already committed to giving yourself the best shot possible at having a natural birth, most of this book will be completely unnecessary (and maybe even off-putting) to you - it's basically a manifesto against modern, conventional maternity care and makes very little room for conflicting viewpoints or even the basic idea that people just approach risk differently. I'm no apologist for hospitals - though I live 5 minutes from a respected maternity ward, I quit my OB and opted to drive 1.5 hours to a birth center - but I still think the first rule of maternity care is respect for what makes the mother comfortable. If you're still trying to make basic philosophical choices about birth and/or are trepidatious about giving birth, then take the advocacy language in this book with a big, heavy grain of sea salt. Try not to let it deepen your fear of medicine and doctors even as it tries to lessen your fear of the birth process itself. Certainly don't let it browbeat you into making a choice that you're not comfortable with.
B006O3MU96|5.0|doodle jump christmas....just like the original and we still play both. my son and I. it's fun AND cute graphics.
B000784WMW|3.0|This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  It's true to the story, which I like, but is more like a filmed play than a movie/mini-series. `
B00594XOZU|5.0|this app is really cool.  Love the instant access to messages, photos and the stream of life.  Wish it was the default.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|This is the album that got me to know Bob Marley, and it's a legendary one indeed. A must have.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good story line.gr8 graphics. easy when using hints. . I am looking forward for the 2nd instalment. highly recomend.Worth the purchase.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This is a total popcorn flick.  It's pretty enjoyable, and I honestly wasn't expecting much from it.  In that respect, it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />With something like this, you have to expect that everything about it is total fantasy.  With that, again, it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The movie could have been more, quite honestly.<br /><br />Why 4 stars instead of 3?  Because it played on the factual relationship Mary Todd had with Stephen Douglas prior to Lincoln.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Wish it was a combo with the DVD, but then again I am too cheap to spring for that. Assuming we will always have a blu-ray around, this is great. Wish it was standard practice to couple a download with a blu-ray since you can't RIP em like you could DVD. Movies are second to none. If you don't like Toy Story, you are pretty lost when it comes to parentally-tolerable kid flix. 1 is good, 2 is OK, 3 is top notch.
B004I744AS|5.0|Well; my son and I are always using it.Because it is easy to access. and the words are good and understandable. we recommend tonuse it. in all ages levels.<br />alma and chris
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Fun for a while.  I no longer have this on my kindle fire hd.  This was for my 5 year old son but just after a while it got old.  ok item

B00B10ENBA|1.0|Very slow, good story, not enough action and no where near as good as all the hype! I would not recommend that anyone purchase this movie...if u wanna see it than rent it, u'll thank me later.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun for a while.  I no longer have this on my kindle fire hd.  This was for my 5 year old son but just after a while it got old.  ok item

B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a horrible bulider. as I thought. I have built a water park. and its only my second day
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It is somewhat hard to know how the character would deal with his mental issues. Sad and funny.<br />Characters were believable.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great setting and seeing how even in difficult changing times how the British elite keep their composure.  Yeah season 3 is next.
B008EKOO46|2.0|While there are a few really great insights, I thought it was poorly written.  So poorly written, it reminded me of reading student papers . . . get out the red pen.  Didn't he have an editor?.  16 definitions of religion , ,  really?  A lengthy passage about a twig that fell to forest floor upright and must have been a signal, except that it wasn't.  Reminding the reader of the obvious, like the traditional people don't have cars.  I was terribly disappointed because I love the subject matter but not the book.  I haven't read his other books and felt like this book could have come from lecture notes from a class he may have taught.  Sorry.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers I'm addicted to it .. I play it all the time... I especially love how it switches to different places like Rome and Rio .. hopefully it keeps doing that and do Chicago or LA or New York or something
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best bible app out in my opinion.  I love the different reading plans and the different bible versions.

B004SIP6QI|5.0|Best film yet, historically accurate, amazing story, and has something for everyone. Fantastic cast and one of the best soundtracks yet.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very well written book. Definitely captures the writers personally experiences incredibly well. Very unfortunate how he ended his time with us, but definitely a great read.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book helps me understand myself and others, what gifts I have, and how to value myself and others who are introverts. Very well-written and helpful.
B002WPVNZM|5.0|My wife and I listen to this album all the time. We always rock out to it when we are in the car together. It also puts my 2 year old son to sleep.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Volume on the E5 is simply too low while riding using my iPhone 5. I'm returning it and purchasing a Scala2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never thought I would be so crazy about a show like this. It's great, can't wait for the new season!
B006X96PF6|5.0|I enjoyed every bit of this recording by Loreena McKennitt.  I don't have every recording that she has published but this one was superb.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great new Bond film that stands up with all the other film.  There is a lot of action in the Bond stile.  I would recommend this film to anyone that is looking for a James Bond action film that they could watch over and over.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I bought it for Valentine's Day and was thrilled. Not only is his voice as fabulous as you would expect, but the instrumentals supporting him are spectacular. Sooooo smooth and romantic.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|But after giving several episodes a whirl, we actually found ourselves eagerly plowing through all available seasons (back to back) for several weeks right up and through the last available show. While the casts intentions were generally initially good (well, thats the approach we understood it to be), sometimes things are simply beyond everyones control - and this television series exploits all kinds of aspects of what can (and certainly will) go wrong in life, especially if you elect a life comprised of criminality attributes. Sometimes it was just so silly and stupid, that you can guess whats going to happen next, but other times, the performance is both chaotic and entertaining at the same time (those who have seen it, how about the entire show based upon a fly). Different, entertaining and we like it. Looking forward to the next season (Summer 2013).
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I first was turned on to this series by a friend and did not start watching till season 3. I was instantly hooked and bought season 1 and now season 2 on Blu-Ray. I was hooked by the characters and love how gross and real the zombies looked and acted when killing or being killed. I love the extras on the discs showing how the show is made and filmed. I have only seen the extras on the season 1 discs but expect more of the same from season 2. Like others have reviewed Season 2 starts off slow but gets better. Just something that's necessary to build each character. That's what makes this show so good is the characters. My wife and others make fun of me for watching this because they just don't get it. All they see is the blood and guts and think that's all there is to it. They can't watch it long enough to get into the characters. Of course I make fun of her for watching every version of the real housewives... YUck! Buy this you will not be disappointed. Amazon had the best price I found and free shipping that made it her several days B4 it was expected.
0805092447|5.0|My daughter learnt the brown bear song at school. We also found some recordings of the song on youtube. So, I decided to buy the book for her as a gift. She simply loves it.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|If you want to show off the back of your Nexus 4 while keeping it safe from some falls, this is the product for you! It raises the edges so your screen doesn't get scratched if you drop it. However when using this I will suggest you apply a screen and back protector. The bumper does make your phone look slightly bigger but the design of it looks nice and blended in with the phone.<br /><br />E: I managed to buy this on amazon for $20 + like a 4 dollar shipping fee or something so it was worth it. DO NOT buy it from anyone selling for more than $30. Just go to the google play store or wait it out if it's sold out.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Just a simple, silly, guilty pleasure to watch with your girlfriends! The plot is pretty basic, a good  movie overall.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The cd functioned perfectly and arrived quickly. I live this cd and her price was just right. I'd been trying to find this album for quite some time. So I was excited to get it
B00AYQNOU8|4.0|Gorgeous images, subtle music. I didn't watch all the way through in one siting, rather I had it off/on over 2 different evenings.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I like the game alot. It had the help right there did not have to go out of the game to get it. I like that it had a map to help with fining clues.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I know myself better when i know cycle of habit . I write a diary every day and i know that i have cue,routine,reward like this book. This book is like the mirror of mine
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie was great. It's a perfect introduction to Thor the character and his story. I will probably watch it over and over!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Earily accurate, unfortunately believable ,<br /><br />The flow of events reminds me of today's headlines accurately reported<br /><br />Verifiable events are credibly presented  and mimic the true trends from<br />humint, satellite, CIA, Stratfor---a talent unique to Clancy
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Surprised me at every turn!  Very suspenseful, wasn't sure how it was going to end until last page.  It kept me very involved , just plain flat out good story.

B00AKOB7CG|4.0|After one use, I thought app had a great selection of exercises and just enough to keep you motivated. Transition from one exercise to another was very quick. Recommend placing device on table or hard surface to allow improved transition to the next exercise. I will continue to use this app
B008M7JODC|5.0|I'm so very happy with this series thus far.  It's been a little gross at times, but overall the whole series has been exciting.  I feel like the subplot is very intriguing and really adds to the show.  I'm excited to watch the next season!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I liked this CD really well.  I have bought all of his CDS and I thought this one had some great songs on it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love the album.  The songs remind me of his Album, &#34;Closer&#34;.  His fabulous voice makes the songs sound so wonderful.
B001MIVTVS|5.0|Jazz chords on guitar and flamboyant imagery back up this folk-era but not very folky cool and joyous paen to love and life.
B00005JKED|5.0|My package came very fast. The only issue I had was that the disk was not snapped in properly  so everytime I picked up the package I could hear the disk moving in the case. But other than that, I was very satisfied.
B0060YIBLK|4.0|Not really heavyweight. Given the author's background, I'd hope for more depth pr more titilating examples. Still, it is a useful little book.
B000M343BM|1.0|Why do you ship a DVD to a country (Australia) that has a different region code to the USA and obviously cannot work?
B007CKNX28|5.0|I’ve been looking forward to Jack White unfettered for quite awhile and I am not disappointed. Filled with surprises (How about opening your first solo work with repetitive one finger Rhodes piano rhythm that just builds into messy contemplation of what’s left after a break up?) and an emotional component that makes very clear this is a wounded man here pouring his heart into this and you have a great example of what White can do. By the time the CD slows down with “Love Interruption,” you realize that White is extracting all the emotions related to a love that has not just died, but has turned to ash in an all-consuming fire. Ably supported by a crack band (The piano work is particularly stellar.), White just works out his feelings in song and it proves to be some intriguing work. Some might feel it’s a bit one note, but I think he just went deep into himself and this is what arrived. And I’m glad he decided to share it.
B006ISJQ3K|4.0|I'm so happy that this was re-release and it has bonuses too. There are different takes on songs like, 3 different \\"Do You Know Where You're Going To?\\"; 2 different \\"Thought It Took A little Time\\"; One Love In My Lifetime\\"; 3 different-\\"Love Hangover\\"; 2- \\"Kiss Me Now\\". There are songs from the \\"To Love Again\\" CD, which doesn't make sense, \\"To Love Again\\"; \\"Together\\" and songs I never heard of before, like \\"Le Lo Li\\", \\"Go Where Your Mind Is\\" and the Donny Hathaway Christmas classic, \\"This Christmas\\" which is wonderful. The last song, which isn't a song but an interview of the diva. But overall, its worth the purchase as my old LP has been wored out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was such a great book.couldn't put it down.recommend<br />.A book you will want to read. Hope for a sequel
B005U9QJY2|5.0|Movie brings back memories from my child hood very good I wish they made more movies like this nowadays !
B0060MYM7O|3.0|The blu-ray disks play fine so far, but the insert with the code for the digital copy is missing. I don't want to return the set, but I want what should be included.<br /><br />Also, there was no order summary with the shipment. There were 2 items in the order which arrived on time, but this is the first time there was no packing slip. Weird.<br /><br />That said, I love this series. Hate that HBO waits until the new episodes are about to start before they release the previous season on disk.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Shocking, amazing, a wake up call on the reality how food is disturbingly manage for the profit of the big companies at our own health expenses!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very nice product, and I have it on my Kindle fire.  I like the display and options and when I start up my Kindle it has an instant blip across the top of the screen.  The graphics are good too.
1427210241|3.0|This book was a good read but it left me wanting closure. There are so many questions i feel weren't answered with the ending. I feel the story was overly detailed in some areas and really lacking in others.Over all the book did follow the story line but it wasn't as good as I expected.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis lays it out for you here. I began with low carb a few years ago and by cutting out most non vegetable carbs, dropped the wheat.  Within a week I had no more stomach pain, gas, bloating or elimination issues.  My rheumatoid arthritis and asthma began going away until my joints no long swelled.  I was amazed.  I also couldn't believe it was the wheat.  Got tested by my doc for celiac and was negative.  Ate a bit of wheat again...symptoms came back.  Which led me to find this book.<br /><br />As I read his explanation of WHY wheat is so bad for you I began to see the light of what was happening.  Although my experience was totally subjective, it was enough for me to be convinced that modern day wheat is a menace to society.  Dr. Davis presents his facts in a clear and well documented with footnotes way.  I trust well done studies over anecdotal stories.  No bro-science here.<br /><br />This book is a must have for anyone searching for the best diet to maintain optimal health.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Though the storyline was different than I expected, I enjoyed it very much. Each character had an unique personality and the action scenes were thrilling
B0044IABFS|5.0|Every show in the season leaves you ready to go on to the next! Expect contextual violence.<br /><br />HLB in Pennsylvania
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great very hard to put DOWN!!!! Its fun trying to unlock all the different characters. I wish though that you could unlock different cities to run.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Wow.  As a die-hard 007 fan, I didn't think that it could get much better.  Daniel Craig delivers. Sam Mendes delivers.  I hope he comes back for the next one (not likely).  Highly recommended.
B000000OF6|4.0|Lots of great songs that most people have heard from Queen. Good Choice as far as Queen goes. I like the first cd better than the second, because I personaly have a taste in their 70's music rather than late 80's and early 90's Rock. Must have.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I know that my words are not going to be adequate in this review, but I'll give it my best shot. I LOVED THIS STORY! So much. Rainbow Rowell is a master at subtlety in her writing. In a world where so many writers use grandiose words and hyperbole to wow us into loving their stories, Rainbow Rowell manages to draw me into her stories with pure simplicity. There are very few huge scenes. Instead there are moments. Little moments that when strung together create a masterpiece of a story. Little things like rubbing a scarf or catching an eye across a room become earth shattering.<br /><br />This book is the story of two young high school students in the 80s who fall in love. But these aren't your typical leads for young adult romance. Park is a half-Korean boy who loves comic books. Eleanor is a bigger girl (but I'm not sure exactly what this means. She thinks she's enormous. Park thinks she's beautiful. I think she's wonderful.) Park's family is a fairly average middle-class family. His parents adore each other and aren't afraid to show it. The biggest problem Park seems to face with his family is that his father is somewhat disappointed that Park isn't the alpha boy he wants him to be. Eleanor, on the other hand, comes from a mess of a family. Her parents are divorced, and now she is living with her mom's new husband, an angry drunk who makes life miserable for everyone, especially Eleanor. Eleanor's family barely has money for food, so she wears old (and odd) clothing, washes her hair with whatever quasi-soap happens to be in the house, and dreams of actually owning a toothbrush. But no one knows about Eleanor's family circumstances, and Eleanor is not going to share them.<br /><br />Somehow, despite all odds against them, these two find themselves growing closer together. The growth of the relationship of this unlikely pair was so well written. I thought that Rowell captured the awkward innocence of first loves. From the hasty declaration of \\"I love you!\\" to the worries about body image and questions about how in the world someone else could possibly want to be with them, the description of the feelings of both Park and Eleanor made me remember my own experiences. I saw a little of my sixteen year-old self in both of them. How many teens fall in love and immediately believe that they are destined to be with their true love for eternity? This book truly shows just how innocent these feelings can be at the same time as they are overwhelming. But you know what? Even though statistically the odds were stacked against this relationship succeeding forever, I still wanted to believe in it because I loved these two together. Eleanor was so incredibly quirky, and so many of her communications seemed abrupt or even mean at times, but Park got her. He understood who she was, even when he had no real idea who she was, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />There isn't exactly a huge story arc that drives the plot of this novel. You don't keep reading because you need to see how something gets resolved. Instead, you keep reading because you are falling in love with these characters at the same time that they are falling in love with each other. You just want to be around them all the time, experiencing life as they do. The ending of this book was absolutely perfect. Absolutely perfect. I finished the book and immediately started writing my own epilogue in my head for this story. It needed one because I was not ready to let these two go, so I was glad for the excellent opening for me to write my own Happily Ever After for these two wonderful characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I was exactly the age of these characters in 1986 when I was in high school, so all of the 80s references were awesome to read. What a strange time, but it is a blast to be reminded of how wonderfully strange it was. There is now a special place in my heart for this book, and Rainbow Rowell is officially my new favorite author. I will look for anythingshe writes in the future and devour it. Five huge stars!she writes in the future and devour it. Five huge stars!
B00870ZH3U|2.0|This was so unnecessary. So very very not needed. Did I mention redundant? Really they thought this was a good idea? I demand a different musical one in which Christine dumps both their whiny asses.
1609611543|5.0|Or I should say, trying it and seeing the results made me a believer. Prior to reading this book,  I'd often heard that taking wheat out of your diet was a good thing, that the wheat we eat now is not the same plant our grandmothers used to eat. One friend told me the arthritis in her hands went away when she cut it from her diet -and it seemed that everyone had a weight loss story to tell after giving up wheat. Weight was my primary concern, so before reading this book, I had already been experimenting with deleting bread from my diet (and sugary deserts). I always made progress with losing weight - but I was having a hard time letting go of it completely.. I do so love my pasta.. And bread is the staff of life, right?! And really, deep down,  I thought gluten free was just another over-hyped, fad diet plan.<br /><br />However, after reading this book, and being  free of gluten for only two weeks, my weight is beginning to go down again, I'm no longer bloated, and the big surprise - my scalp Psoriasis is almost completely gone. This was not a painful condition, but it was kinda icky/embarrassing to have this on my scalp (looked like *really* bad scaly, dandruff). The only thing that helped it was a steroid cream - and we all know that steroids are not good for you. So this has been quite a nice, and completely surprising, side benefit to going wheat free.  My adult acne is so much better, too.. It's kind of amazing. While I have not been diagnosed with anything, I obviously have (at least) a sensitively to gluten. I'm learning more about Celiacs and autoimmune diseases as well (Psoriasis, I've learned,  is an autoimmune disorder - as are some forms of arthritis).<br /><br />Additionally, learning the details of how wheat has been changed by humans has been invaluable in helping me to avoid it.  For instance, did you know that the wheat we eat today is tiny compared to the flowing \\"amber waves of grain\\" we've all heard about? That the plant can no longer grow by itself in the wild -it will wither and die without assistance from us - no matter what climate it's planted in? And most disturbing, after all the genetic engineering of this plant, we are eating compounds never before consumed by humans? Yikes.. And did you know that you can actually have<br />Celiacs and be symptom free (at least symptom free in the usual sense of digestion issues)? That Celiacs can cause neurological issues? I didn't!<br /><br />No more \\"healthy whole grains\\" for me. As Dr. Davis points out in this book, you won't have *any* nutrient deficiencies when getting rid of wheat/gluten - just improved appearance and health.<br /><br />The only problem I had with Dr. Davis's approach is that he seems to be sugar phobic.. You'll understand his reasoning when you read the book, and it makes sense in the abstract, but I'm not reducing the amount of  whole fruit, legumes and beans in my diet because they cause a slight rise in blood sugar. I truly believe that unless you are diabetic, you don't need to do this.. But regarding  the wheat/gluten information - reading this book has been truly life changing. And it goes hand in hand with all the new scientific findings that inflammation is the underlying cause of so many diseases..
B00355L2TU|4.0|I just got this and have only used it once.  However, the work out was very challenging, even though it was only 20 min. long and I am very sore the next day.  So, based on that Jillian is delivering on her promises.  We'll see what I look and feel like at the end of the month.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|These games are EVERYWHERE. I had been hoping it would be something else, but it was just like every other &#34;bejeweled&#34; knockoff. I played it through, but it has very limited replayability. If match and drop are your cup of tea, this one will do it for you...
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a wonderful and captivatingly detailed historical novel I have ever read.  The book was engrossing from the first page to the last and worth reading again.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes not only romance but history as well.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the most inspiring boooks that I've ever read. Adam is an example on all aspects of life. A real stand up Man. Besides his great story, it's also very well written. The kind of books that leaves you with an odd feeling when you finish it. You get the feeling of not being ready to say good bye to all those real life characters. The book has it all, drama, romance, suspense and it makes you laugh sometimes too...And is a real life story. Get your copy!
0060574216|5.0|I give this book to my adult children when they get married.  It cements a sound marraige.  A must buy!
1452113432|5.0|Rachel has a wonderfully illustrated cookbook with delightful recipes that are easy to follow and really turn out great.  I have enjoyed watching her show on the Cooking Channel and that is why I ordered her book.  Sadly, they say their will not be anymore shows in the near future.<br /><br />Noone should be afraid to cook and Rachel shows us that you don't need a fancy kitchen with all kinds of equipment to make a great meal, breakfast or dessert!
B009FZFONO|5.0|My life is so much better watching this amazing show.  The morals and messages are very timely.  Don't miss it.

B0015DROBO|5.0|As mysteries go this one was excellent, mainly due to it's unique but believable characters. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that in the first half a tremendous amount of information was presented in a fairly tedious manner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun and challenging !! I love it and hope I can one day reach the highest score! !!
B000AP04KQ|5.0|So funny; and it gets funnier each time you view it. Goofy plot, but has lots of ties to the reality of the workplace.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun game but please put down some of the prices of<br />the upgrades other then that it is good thank u God bless u
B00009R6H2|5.0|This was purchased as an extra QR plate for my new 498 RC4 ball head.  It will allow me to have both camera bodies all set up and ready to go.<br /><br />One of the things I didn't like about previous QR plates I've tried was always trying to figure out which way they were supposed to face, and I wound up having to mark the back of the plate so I could get it aligned quicker.  No need for that with this plate.  It's rounded at one end, and straight on the other, and locks onto the 498 RC4 head like a dream.<br /><br />Can't ask that a product do more than it's supposed to, and this one fills the bill perfectly.
B00005K9LM|4.0|This album was recorded in 1983 & was released in early January 1984. My TOP favorite songs on this CD are # 5 \\"Love Bites (In the Dead Of Night)\\", # 10 \\"Defenders Of the Faith\\" AND the Bonus Track \\"Turn On Your Light\\" which is EXCELLENT, in my opinion.  I also forgot to mention \\"Rock Hard Ride Free\\" which was quite familiar to me.& it's right up there w/ the other songs I  just mentioned. The # 8 song \\"Night Comes Down\\" is good & seems more mellow like \\"Turn On Your Light\\" does.  \\"Jawbreaker\\" is pretty good as is \\"Freewheel Burning\\", BOTH of these songs seem similar to me. The # 6 song \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is probably my LEAST favorite & \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\" is pretty good.  I like this album, but I think I like Judas Priest on their  Seventies (1976-1979) music preferably...Not as loud as they were in the Eighties. I just forgot to mention that I LOVE \\"British Steel\\" from 1980.  \\"Point of Entry\\" from 1981 isn't too bad either.  I've yet to hear OR buy 1982's \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\", even though I've heard a lot of good things about it from other people. Back to 1984, I forgot to mention that the  Live in Concert version of \\"Heavy Duty / Defenders Of the Faith\\"  is also  pretty good.  The LIVE version of \\"Defenders Of the Faith\\" is Much Longer than the STUDIO version is.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great battery show and give a lot of useful info shows the Times for producers and give as an idea how long the battery will last
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like the edge that I get from this little guy. Cheap knives will be ground up, and a steel doesn't work for me after using this. Glad I got this.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|Thank you very much for the movie The Hangover Part Two.  These movies are some of the funnies movies ever.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best fantasy novels I've had the pleasure to read. Patrick Rothfuss is my new favorite author.  Cannot Cannot wait for the next book in the series!
B009NWTOLC|5.0|My fiance asked me for The Extra Terrestrial Anniversary limited edition set for Christmas.  He loves this movie and loved the plush.
B00BESLT6G|3.0|The cinematography was great and the actors did an excellent job, but it didn't add anything new from the previous film.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is my favorite book, i have read it many times over and every time i get sucked into it unable to put it down. I am not a big fan of other period classics as such but there's something about Lizzy and Mr Darcy that get me every time.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Like a few other reviews I thought it was comical that no one ever turns on a light while inside the house, but the music and the idea of the film was very creepy and added to the movie. If you like being creeped out, this is a good one to watch.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My son and I are both in scouting and thought this was hilarious.  It was a good clean movie for all to see, although there were a couple scenes that may be inappropriate for young views.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like this version better than temple and temple brave....I play it mostly on the ipad the graphics are awesome....in some cases extended play lead you to feeling a little nauseous/vertigo..lol
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy challenging my abilities of hand/eye coordination. And it becomes more exciting to have the ability to turn the cube to find matches and even more to try and beat your best time. Gives sort of a since of accomplishment when you see the words &#34; Record Time&#34; flash up on the screen when you have completed finding all the matches.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The actors were great but the material was not. I kept with it but it was like nails on a chalk board. I read the reviews and thought there must be something in it that was worth something due to the Oscar nominations but I can honestly say that I wish I could get the hours back that I spent on this film. You've been warned but sadly so was I and I didn't take the advice, wish I had.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 6 yr. old grandson picked this game and he played it till we forced him to stop to eat dinner. It amazes me how the young children have such coordination and always seem to know just how to play something they have never played before.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great plot and animation!!! Action packed and very sweet.  Great story about a mother and daughter relationship in trouble and what needs to help to bring them back together.  My mother and I just loved this movie--she is 61 and I'm 38 :0)

B0064X7FVE|2.0|I tried to download this to my Kindle and it never downloaded.  I must need to have a more upgraded version, in order for this ap to work. So I have deleated from my Kindle.
1419707671|5.0|I would recommend these books to all my friends...they're very good books...I rate it high because I read them over and over..
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game would allow you to go so far. Would not allow me to go into the next rooms unless I upgrade the game, which ment more money.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Pretty decent game playing, although the built-in moves are often not what I wanted and I have to redo them by hand.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy playing the game. Each level requires you challenges.  Need to move your eyes around more to catch three colors/shapes in a row during the time allowed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is fun and exciting. I love it. you can do all sorts of things with your horse that you can do in real life.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|Kiss has done it this time. A true throwback to the best Rock and Roll has to offer. Classic with a blast of freshness that pours out track after track.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game continually crashes on my fire hd. Now it doesn't even load. Thank God I didn't actually purchase something in game and waste my money! Very disappointing because the game is fun if it actually worked.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome detail and craftsmanship. Get your copy before they are all gone. A true center piece of your collection. Done
B0001IN07Q|5.0|bought as a gift for my sis and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  really enjoyed dvd which gave personal insight to artist and the cd.  as a bonus I was pleasantly surprised to receive a free download of the music as well.  another plus is that the item was delivered in 2 days with amazon prime.  overall great experience.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thought this was a beautiful story.  It had some great twists and turns and when I was done reading I truly missed the characters.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I use it on my 10&#34; tablet. I'm 61 and my eyesight is not what it used to be. Some layouts are a little hard to see on my screen. Otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book/series was recommended by my sister.  I really enjoyed the books, the details of sex and the adventures of Anastasia and Christian.  Her willingness to explore and his to be what she needs also.  I would and have recommended this series to several friends.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy the game....but don't like having the progress taken away every time I upgrade. I have only had the game since January. It has upgraded 2 times and both times it started me over from the beginning. Eventually I will get enough and stop playing.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|I love this movie had a previous copy but it was stolen so this is the replacement that I will keep a better eye on

B003JTHXOK|5.0|From the first chapter you become sucked into this novel.  You truly feel for Katie an  want her a way from he  abusive husband.  An  then she meets Alex, the perfect man.  Even though you think she is finally safe, trouble seems to find her again.  Excellent right down to the twist at the end.
B004I7GR6C|1.0|Gore for the sake of gore.  Flimsy plot, not worth the time and effort to watch.  Do yourself a favor skip this one.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Well-made, good looking and convenient. puts the unit asleep when you close it. the stand works very well, but only made to stand in the horizontal position. Elastic band holds it closed. This may be an eventual weak point, but so far so good after 2 months. Would buy it again.
B000P0J09C|5.0|In a collection of films about Marines and/or the Viet Nam war this is an indispensible motion picture.  Based on Gustav Hasford's book The Short-Timers it is a classic.  With few exceptions the movie captures the war and the 60's era as if you are there now.  I was there and this is a fine film that pulls no punches.  R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onifrio's portraels of a Marine DI and a hapless recruit are spot on.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Insurance companies have given us a run for our money too.  It's nice to see the lawyers go after them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good and fun app! Very similar to temple run but better in many ways. The daily challenge is great and it makes you won't to go on everyday to get the  better prizes! The only thing I wish you could get is to extend the length of the hover boards. Great app though and worth downloading.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Excellent read. It keeps you interested all the way through the books, because you never know what will happen next.

I'm okay.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Always.<br /><br />I believe something needs to be said-actually, a lot of things need to be said but I need to say this first. I totally recommend this book to be listened to instead of read. For me, I got the luxury of reading it on my kindle and listening to it but I found so many weird dance words that I couldn't pronounce so with the audiobook help, everything was much more convenient. Additionally, the narrator had a beautiful voice that was played well.<br /><br />Due to my incoherent mind, this review will be a rather horrible sob of mix matched words.<br /><br />Hazel Grace is a cogent female heroine. Beautiful, smart, relatable, strong and realistic person. John Green, you are amazingly cruel yet awesome at the same time. I hate you for many things now, but I love you for more reasons. For example, the characters you created in this book. Augustus Waters....I don't think I can say anything without leaving spoilers, and I hate spoilers so let us say that he was equally strong, and had some adorable charming features.<br /><br />The chemistry Hazel and Gus had was phenomenally the best I've encountered for some time. It was just so perfect and not dragging on and on. I just love them sooooo much!!<br /><br />Death is great. No really, if the author can properly incorporate it, it is essentially a masterpiece. The Fault In Our Stars successfully made me cry for a long time, just sobbing and wailing. If I ever find out that there was a sequel, which most likely will not happen, I'd flip out and write a one million paged rant. I have no idea where I've been these years, why didn't I read his earlier?!?!? Once again, I'm sorry guys but I don't feel quipped to write a thorough, educated/posh like review. Nevertheless, this book should not be missed.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|thought provoking, great acting, well done. This movie is interesting. Im still not sure what it means exactly, I enjoyed it though.

B0094K1JPC|3.0|McAdams is good, Ford is good, put them in a movie together and you have a halfway decent flick.<br />I wouldn't watch it again, but I don't feel like I wasted my time.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Okay, I'm more of an introvert than an extrovert, and I feel better and more comfortable about it now than before reading this book.  I enjoyed the book, but a few sidelines demonstrated the author's bias and thoughtless acceptance of propaganda.  These diversions weren't necessary to the story, but they soured my view of this book and made it harder for me to take the author seriously as an objective teacher.  For example, she blames bankers and Wall Street for the financial melt-down, without considering that the federal government and progressive policies forced the banks to make many of the choices they made.  She also unquestioningly accepts and parrots Al Gore's unscientific assertion that man is causing global warming and if we don't follow the enviro-zealots preferences we're all doomed.  I'm a scientist, and I don't think any of us is smart enough to fully understand long-term weather changes, let alone to conclude that what's happening is anthropomorphic.<br /><br />Like I said, the book was solid, but some of the examples show the author's bias, and I found them disappointing and distracting.

B004LQGSKA|1.0|Upon receiving my DVD, I was extremely upset to find that it is a region 2 DVD, and therefore could not play on my region 1 devices, as I am a US resident. This is very frustrating because the Amazon page for this DVD cleary says that it works for &#34;All Regions.&#34; If you are a US resident, do not buy this DVD; the Amazon page is misleading, and the DVD will not work.<br /><br />Ich bin sehr angreich, denn das DVD funktioniert nicht bei Region 1 Machinen. Obwohl die Amazon Webseite sagt, dass das DVD wird bei alle Regionen funktioniert, es funktioniert nur fuer Region 2. Ich wohne in USA, so ich bin angreich, dass ich kann mein DVD nicht sehen. Bitte, wenn du in Region 1 wohnt, kauft diese DVD nicht!

B000QCTNIW|5.0|Everyone would benefit from reading this book.  It is so full of information and lays out real possibilities while dispelling myths about how our brains actually work.  If you know anyone with learning issues, Alzheimer's, stroke victims, or that are blind or missing a limb, this is a MUST READ.  It could transform their lives!  The chapter on imagination is also illuminating.  If you thought a book about the brain might be boring.......think again.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|(1) The live CD is pretty good, except Stevie's singing isn't really at its best in her songs except for 'Dreams'. But 'Oh Daddy' is AMAZINGLY phenomenal, and 'Never Going Back Again' and 'The Chain' are pretty darn good too. The musicianship, however, is top-notch all the way through. Christine, never to be underestimated, shines through on every single track she plays on. (2) I never knew it was called the 'Rosebud Film' documentary, but the DVD is really great in showing the band in some really great performances at that time. I've seen bits and pieces of this over the years, so it was great to finally see it in its entirety. (3) The 'More from the Recordings Sessions' CD has some new stuff, including demos of Planets of the Universe', 'Songbird' and alternate versions of 'Keep Me There'. (4) Nothing new about the 'Recording Sessions, Roughs and Outtakes' that hasn't already been previously released, but I REALLY wish they had put 'Think About It' on the original album instead of &#34;I Don't Want To Know'! (5) I could have done without all the stupid versions of 'Never Going Back Again'. (6) The Deluxe booklet is really great, and I'm surprised they got Christine to say anything in it considering she's been in Anti-Mac retirement since 1997 (Major loss -- get her post-Mac 'In The Meantime' CD -- AWESOME). The packaging concept is really good, except all the CD/DVD sleeves had rippled edges either from initially being inserted in their pockets, or during transit. It's a minor flaw and nothing that keeps me from loving it. I got it for a great price!
B004KZOWEG|4.0|This is a reasonably fast read that definately portrays King Leopold's greed and terror. Generally, I find historical books a bit more exciting but this one does have a tendency to drag at times.  One small complaint about this and some other downloaded books.  It did not have the pictures that are included in the paper version.  This isn't a deal breaker but does raise a question about downloaded books.  Why don't they have them?  Seems like it would be easier to download them than including in a paper book.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is a really good app!  You can edit a lot on Picsart.  its much faster than the other photo editor apps!

B009EJSUBY|5.0|When I was growing up as a budding classical piano student in the late 60s and early 70s, it became fashionable to disparage Van Cliburn. \\"He's a has-been...a meteor that burned out...he plays everything too slowly...he never developed...\\" and so forth and so on. Now listening to his entire body of recorded work on RCA in this marvelous recreation of his LP albums (complete with the original album covers) I realize how presumptuous, infantile and wrong people were (including myself)! Here was a true artist of the first caliber, who simply refused to fashion himself to the times or be a slave to convention but, instead, remained always true to himself. His was a first-rate talent who left a considerable body of work not to mention helping selflessly to launch the careers of countless young artists through the competition that bears his name.<br /><br />Understandably, he tired of always being asked to play the Tchaikovsky 1st and Rachmaninoff 3rd piano concerti and towards the end of his performing career when he stopped playing in public (an \\"intermission\\" he called it) in 1978 he, at times, supposedly gave perfunctory performances of these war horses. (However I heard him do the Tchaikovsky in Denver, Colorado in 1993 and it was fabulous. He was supposed to play the Rachmaninoff 3rd in the 2nd half of the concert but canceled it because he was supposedly exhausted). If the critics castigated him and derided him because he somehow didn't live up to their expectations, that was their problem. Cliburn remained true to his own artistic demeanor: a big, bold luscious tonal register and old Russian school of romantic playing that hearkened back to the Golden Age of pianists (he was an avatar or a throwback to a previous age, is all).<br /><br />In this set is everything he recorded for RCA over the years, and the performances are sublime: ranging from a Mozart sonata to the Liszt Sonata, Rachmaninoff 2nd Sonata, and Brahms Handel Variations to all the concerti he recorded in addition to the two aforementioned war horses. (His Beethoven 3rd, 4th and 5th concerti are especially noteworthy; performances critics at the time of their release castigated him for; hard to understand that now listening to what I believe are fabulous performances today!). Also included are the Barber Sonata, Prokofiev 6th sonata as well as stellar performances of the McDowell 2nd and Prokofiev 3rd piano concerti. There is some fluff thrown in as well, like an album of famous piano pieces but even those encore pieces are delightfully played. There's always a rich singing tone and lyrical line to Cliburn's playing no matter what it is. He wasn't interested in the avant-garde or in recording the Baroque or early classical era. It just wasn't his style.<br /><br />Sony was prescient in releasing this wonderful set shortly before Mr. Cliburn passed. God speed to him and here's a resounding bravo to a great artist and his legacy!
B008133JZG|5.0|One of the best episodes yet! Sherlock almost meets his match. I am looking forward to more cat and mouse with Irene.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Action from start to finish, has a couple of slow spots, but would recommend all who loves 007 to mark as a gotta see.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written<br /><br /> Suspenseful, keeps you looking forward to the next chapter<br />I would recommend it to all of my friends
B00ANUNYGY|5.0|So glad it's now available on prime. This was and still is one of the very best shows ever on television. The only people I've met who don't like it are people who don't like the genre. Their loss.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|...if you rent it for 48 hours you will keep watching overoveroveroverover...effects, story, actual acting all in an entertaining bundle...he's the best 007 since Sean..!!..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the same format as the original Temple Run, with some new additions, such as a zip-line and mining cart. It's a little more challenging than the last one, which is good. My only complaint is the &#34;Monkey/ape&#34; creature that chases you is SO big, that it's hard to see your character and where he is on the screen, otherwise, a super fun waste of time!
0345803485|1.0|After reading \\"Fifty Shades of Shame\\" I was essentially disappointed. I had no idea what this book had that drove so many women; bright, educated, well-read women, into blissful oblivion.<br /><br />Many of the gripes I had with the book were touched upon quite humorously by previous reviewers; the endless quips the trip over themselves repetitively, the \\"Twilight\\" parallels, the geographical inaccuracies, etc.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this novel was the narrator herself; Anastasia Steele. Initially, this young woman is presented as a literary major, well read, who revels in wholesome literature. She'd rather share a bottle of wine with a Tolstoy novel than a man. Fine. The same character then, throughout the course of the book, leaps from her persona of a well-educated, refined young woman to a ditzy lovestruck teenager (Bring out the quips!). It's flat out annoying to have a character swoon over a first edition volume of \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" only to have the same character exasperate with phrases like, \\"Double Crap/Triple Crap\\" while clutching herself \\"Down There\\" panting after a man.<br /><br />Ana's digressions into the stunts of her Sexual Goddess are another matter entirely. For those of you who have ever watched \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" on the Disney Channel in the early 2000's, I kept thinking about the show's cuts into Lizzie's \\"cartoon self\\" getting into mischief whenever Ana mentioned the acrobatics and naughty escapades her goddess was reveling in. It added to Ana's irritating personality and detracted from the few traits she had which could have potentially made her a strong female character.<br /><br />Another issues I had with Ana was her appetite. Throughout the two books I read (I cannot bring myself to finish the trilogy), Ana is constantly \\"forgetting to eat.\\" She inadvertently starved herself for nearly a week pining over lost love in Book 2 of this series and then commented about how she had been enjoying the weight she'd unintentionally lost. Maybe that's why she's always biting her lip... it's not her Sexual Goddess but her Ethiopian alter-ego begging her to find a cheeseburger.<br /><br />The rest of the book follows suit with the reviews of others. Yes, Christian Grey is absolutely unfathomably unrealistic, but this book was written for the same group of teenagers and middle-aged women that cried together during the credits of \\"Breaking Dawn Part 2.\\" The sex I had no problem with... It explored a world foreign to many in a way that made it acceptable.<br /><br />Characters like Ana Steele are the reason our daughters are self-loathing, desperate, and starving themselves.
B00A74Q8OQ|5.0|I love being able to stream NCIS through my Wii and get to watch the shows before someone at work ruins the episodes for me. I love NCIS what a great show :-) Love all the characters!  Thanks for having the option to stream episodes! So far I have not had any streaming issues or issues w/it playing at all.
055357342X|5.0|This book didn't fit like I thought it would, but that's what made me love it so much. It foreshadows magic all the time, and is filled with savage battles, incest, explicit nudity (depending on how quickly your imagination can run), love, and hate. Normally books fit a little loosely and don't keep my attention, but this one felt snug like a brass cod piece that's somewhere around two sizes too small.<br /><br />Plunging you into the middle of these Lord of the Rings scale battles, this book gives you intense violence but quickly lands you between the legs of lovers or long missed family. The realist look at humanity the author paints, full of its dirty truths, is comforting to me. Life isn't easy or clean or fun most of the time.<br /><br />Read it because it makes you think, not because it feels good. Then you'll find yourself engrossed more than you'd believe.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept my interest but the characters were not very likable. They really deserved each other after 5 years of marriage.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  As does my neice.  The coolorr are bright and the sound is good.  Fun game to play.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I loved the whole series. With every book they just got better and better. Definatly one i would suggest to someone.

B008XG1X18|5.0|The pinterest app for the Kindle is great.  It is quite easy to navigate.  The graphics are nice and I enjoy browsing.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|Okay, I'll admit that everyone's a fan of the Lord of the Rings Saga and the Hobbit.  This is a review of the product, not the movie.  Please DO NOT give into the sensationalism of buying the same movie over and over again (Peter Jackson, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Disney...).  5-Discs, 0 Special Features.  Why not just wait until the extended edition instead of making these studios more profitable?
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Graphics are exactly the same as on my laptop.  Very easy to navigate.  This app is on my favorites.  I use this app more on my kindle thatn my home pc
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a simple alarm clock, but has many set up features, if you choose.  I previously tried an alarm clock, but couldn't find the snooze button or area on the Kindle Fire.  This one is very obvious.  Snooze or Dismiss.  The only negative is the volume could be louder (when set to the loudest).  Nice app though.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|It is a bit limited because the Kindle only has a front facing camera but the pictures that I took were very clear and nice.  I used it for scenery pictures on my vacation and they look great
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a really good show. Another good British show. Shows how people live in England in the early 1800's.

B00B0LPYXG|4.0|It's more of a rare occasion nowadays to see a movie where brilliant actors are given the chance to fully immerse in their characters.  This is easily one of Denzel's best roles. I was very enchanted watching his broken character's struggle to overcome his demons.  A very lifelike and humble story.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|Not bad. It's no marble madness, but it is fun. The game is sure to get old quick, but at face value it delivers as a time waster. Thanks for making this game, whoever you are!
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|...I had played the demo for this game on Steam and it seemed like a fun tower defense game.  So when I saw it was on sale for my fire, I jumped on a purchase.  Too bad there are no words in the game.  Not only are no words as subtitles for VOS, I mean no words on the menu, the menu choices, etc. Makes the game pretty much unplayable and useless.<br /><br />I tried touching base with the developer of the game and heard nothing. Will contact Amazon soon to get my money back.  What a waste.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love this show. I have each season in DVD, except Season 5, but when it comes out I will.<br />Season Fourth was amazing!!!!!  Always! ;)
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Yes, the impeccable artistes at Pixar of course created a masterpiece with this one. Wonderfully voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres, with beautiful background and character animation. If you asked yourself could a CGI (or any) animation match the stunning natural beauty of an ocean reef, the answer is yes. Throw in a great story, writing and marvelous direction by Andrew Stanton, and you have, well, another Pixar/Disney classic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book.  Quick read  Was very surprised by this story.  Very well written and kept you engaged the whole time

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle gives a very candid look into his experience as a Navy SEAL sniper and it's effect on his personal relationship with his wife Taya.  It also has input from his wife's point of view.  Definitely five stars.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Realistic...plenty of action...with great character acting.<br />I'm really glad that I watched this season. I missed it when it was<br />playing originally...so I'm glad that I was able to catch it on Amazon.
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|A cornball movie with childish ideas of patriotism and the idea that might makes right. A typical action movie.  Word.

B009AMALLM|3.0|These movies seem to be getting less and less scary, this ones just lots of boring crap, the odd little freaky thing, that no one sees, a couple of good jump scary moments, then an ending that is just blah, like they had no idea what to do and just decided let's just .... Can't say it without ruining it (hah) for those yet to watch, but lets say there is little to ruin.  Why can't someone make a good SCARY ghost movie ? All this over commercialized garbage trying to appease everyone, is not appeasing us hard cored horror fans :(  sheesh I'd even write a script !
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My friends and I are always playing this on my kindle fire. Whenever I'm bored I just hop onto this game it keeps me entertained for thirty minutes to an hour I play this about four five or six times a day totally worth the money. And I'm 10 Years old. I recommend this for everyone its also funny they make silly sounds and make silly faces well I said enough buy this app and find.out how tu. it is for yourself! :D -AWSOME GAME-<br /><br />  -Shawna :P &lt;3

1616550414|5.0|As a wee lad of 7 years old I remember getting my SNES for Christmas in 1992. Along with the system I got a few games, one being &#34;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to The Past.&#34; It wasn't until the excitement from Super Mario World calmed down that I finally decided to pop this game in and see what it was like. As soon as the Master Sword came down, locking into place behind the Tri-force and making that now well-known &#34;shhhink&#34; noise, I knew I was in for something awesome. I remember convincing my parents to let me stay up past my bed time that Friday night. I remember going to the store and looking for anything Zelda-related I could find. I was hooked. I fell in love with this game, and it is a love that has lived now for 20 years.<br /><br />This book is like a Zelda bible. There is so much lore and history in this book. It goes into detail about the events prior to the original Zelda for the NES, and details how the games tie into each other and we finally get an official time line. While a lot of speculation has (and always will be) debated and talked about on-line, to actually see the different story lines and how things work is very cool and also works to fill a lot of gaps in the series. The detailed descriptions about each game, the story, the characters, the items, and the weapons that play a pivotal role in the Zelda series make for a great read. The day it came in the mail I sat down that night and proceeded to read through the entire thing. The artwork from each game is also great to see and the Skyward Sword manga comic included is very cool. In fact, after reading the included Skyward Sword manga I have no started to buy the other Zelda mangas as well. This book is a fantastic addition to any Zelda fan's library, and a great addition to anyone's video game collection as well.<br /><br />If you love Zelda, enjoy a great story and some very cool artwork, do yourself a favor and buy this book. You will not be disappointed.

B009L7MD44|2.0|Je considère que ce produit demande à être amélioré de façon significative. Un manque au niveau de la connection entre l'appareil devrais être comblé. Une fois que ça fonctionne (presque) c'est agréable, mais le temps perdu à trouver un moyen que le iusbport se connecte.... trouver une application plus intuitive que chrome ou safari, demande un peu de patience. Pour ma part j'ai acheté l'app it's playing qui permet de lire tout les fichiers vidéos. Mais là encore pour rejoindre les fonctions interne de iusbport... ça demande patience et investissement. L'app iusbport seulement disponible sur l'ipad, n'est vraiment pas au niveau et ne permet la lecture que des fichiers mpeg4.<br />Triste aventure que celle du iusbport. Je ne la recommande pas vraiment. L'idée est excellente, mais demande une réflexion plus poussé!<br />Les geek vont tripper, les monsieurs madames tout le monde vont sacrer!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Very interesting to read and learn the relationship among men who have held the highest office in the nation and their common bond.  Surprising to read about learn of the reliance upon former presidents, regardless of party affiliation and ill-will from hard fought campaigns.  The dirty tactics utilized by presidential candidates, the no-win situations faced by others while in office and how they handled the situations makes for a great read.  Anyone interested in US history and its presidents must read this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|it was a much faster paced story, I still enjoyed all the ups and downs I found myself following all the emotions. (laughing out loud and crying at times too)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Whether your marriage is on the rocks, going great, or beginning anew, this book offers easy to understand, logical steps on how to speak your partner's language.  When you know what it is that makes your partner happy, it makes sense that the relationship will continue to grow and stay strong after the initial euphoria is gone.  It's an easy read, that made me think about what I can do to improve my relationship with my partner.

B0000UN25A|4.0|I'm a fan of Joe Cocker, and I feel this album could use some editing.  The order of the cuts should be &#34;shuffled&#34; a bit, and a couple of the songs could be eliminated.
0767847431|5.0|Another fun favorite by the incredible Ray Harryhausen.  Written by one of the creative forces behind The Avengers TV series, Brian Clemens.  Starring John Phillip Law as Sinbad (he plays this role with charm and aplomb, if not the best Sinbad, certainly one of the best to take on the famous character).  He’s matched and outmatched every step of this adventure by the best Doctor Who ever, Tom Baker (as the evil magician Koura).  Also present, if not in mind or spirit, certainly body, Caroline Munro as Margiana, a pretty sidekick.  The story moves briskly between the creations of Harryhausen (easily the best part of this film).  First up is a homunculus (I like to think of it as batty); it starts the film off with a present of sorts, a bauble Sinbad quickly adorns himself with.  My favorite scene and creation is the figurehead on Sinbad’s ship, when it gets up and goes, wow.  Also exceptional is Kali, a statue with six arms and six swords that battles Sinbad and his men.  Less effective is the fight between the one-eyed centaur and a griffin that shows up out of nowhere.  It’s abrupt and all too brief and makes one wonder what’s the point?  Otherwise, another fabulous film for my collection.

B00138H0H4|4.0|This is a solid project from an amazing musician. Some of Brandi's best work is here.  I think that she shows more vocal control on Give Up the Ghost, and Bear Creek's lyrics show a maturity not always demonstrated on this project.  But Brandi's unbelievable talent is still pushing at the seams of every track on The Story. Personal favorites would be the title track and \\"Cannonball.\\"
B0038TWHP6|4.0|A great movie for fans of Liam Neeson and for those interested in Irish history.  While a 2 hour plus movie cannot due justice to the amazing and somewhat tragic story of this larger than life Irish hero - still revered today - it offers a pretty good synopsis of the troubles and how the current state of Eire came to be.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I have seen reviews of this album saying Muse has lost something or changed. Only real artists do change and this is another great album from a great band. Let go of your preconceived notions about any musician, or any creative person for that matter, and you may grow as a listener as well.

B004JK61K0|5.0|I am using K-9 4 against a dovecot 1.2.15 service running on a debian vps.

B000087F6M|3.0|Originally made in 1986 and released on VHS this little bit of confused fluff is now available on DVD.  Reason for resurrecting it?  Probably to remind us how fine an actress (even given this script....) Debra Winger was in those days. Also it provides a chance to see a younger Robert Redford in a whimsical role. Other than that, this film is one of those space fillers that has some occasional good lines and interesting situations for a story that began as an investigation of the rather grim haggling over the estate of brilliant painter Mark Rothko. A bit of interesting fact: Debra Winger actually left the powerful Creative Artists Agency over this film. She felt that since all the major cast and crew members were with CAA at the time, they did not hire the best people, they hired only clients who could get the film made!<br /><br />District Attorney Tom Logan (Robert Redford) is set for higher office, at least until he becomes involved with defense lawyer Laura Kelly (Debra Winger) and her unpredictable client, performance artist Chelsea Deardon (Daryl Hannah). It seems the least of Chelsea's crimes is the theft of a very valuable painting, but as the women persuade Logan to investigate further and to cut some official corners, a much more sinister scenario starts to emerge. The owner of the gallery Victor Taft (Terrance Stamp) manipulates and is manipulated and eventually murdered but not until the team of Logan and Kelly have at it in a romp that is supposed to be tense but results in being rather silly. And who is to blame for the murder? Why, Chelsea Deardon, of course, and it is up to our legal eagles to get her acquitted.<br /><br />Ivan Retiman (Ghostbusters) directs and also wrote (with Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr.) and the supporting cast includes such actors as Brian Dennehy, John McMartin, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Christine Baranski among a host of others. It is not a bad film, just a misguided one, but if a serving of whipped cream is your choice of the evening .... Grady Harp, March 13ening .... Grady Harp, March 13
B00198X0WW|2.0|The movie won awards for a reason.  It is exceptional.  Whatever company recorded it to BluRay, however, did a horrible job with the soundtrack.  During the entire movie, it sounded as though there was rain falling in the background.  It was distracting at the least and very much disappointing.  I really like the movie, but the BleRay was awful.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I remember when this rescue took place. The story of this daring rescue was exciting. The movie details the cruelty of the Shah if Iran's toward the Iranian citizens. These six americans managed to nescape when the Iranians were taking over the American embassy. They were able to find refuge at the home of the Canadian ambassador's home. The Iranians were able to place shredded documents together and discover that they hadn't captured all of the Americans. The lead character played by Ben Afleck comes up with an off the wall plan to film a movie in Iran.<br /> They are sucessful ib selling this plan to the U. S. government and to Hollywood. They use the time that they gain to secure false documentation and other paperwork that they will need to get out of Iran. They are able to devise a plan to actually escape Iran. A short time ahead of the escape the Carter administration comes up with a plan to use the military to rescue the American citizens. Mendez,played by Afleck decidea to go ahead with escaping. It is a good thing because the military plan was a total failure. The final scenes will scare you to death Be sure to watch this movie,it is outstanding.

0143034901|4.0|I’m usually fairly skeptical about books that have been given hype to the umpteenth degree, as is the case with The Shadow of the Wind. However, I feel Zafon’s The Shadow of the Wind lives up to its recognition, and deserves the many praises. Not only does the author have command of an intricately woven plot and storytelling, but he does so with a Gothic mood and atmosphere that hooks you into Daniel Sempere’s world.  In many ways, The Shadow of the Wind pays homage to classic authors such as Dickens and Poe with the various elements: dark secrets, mysterious characters, puzzling circumstances, love, coming of age, hope, tragedy, and one seriously diabolical villain.<br /><br />As far as the plot, Daniel Sempere, a young boy, is first introduced to the world of books when his father takes him to the mysterious Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Choosing a novel entitled The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax, Daniel sets into motion fate and destiny. Upon learning that someone is going great lengths to destroy every copy of this author’s works, Daniel goes on a quest to search for this mysterious author and understand his life. Along the way, Daniel experiences love, and learns more about himself as a person and the puzzle of Carax. There’s something foreboding—and intriguing—about the possession of this book and it opens to the door to many mysteries of the past and present: forbidden love, unforeseen danger.<br /><br />For the most part, Zafon’s novel has a compelling, mysterious, enchanting quality, one that engages and interests the reader from the start. I also enjoyed some of the minor characters too, especially Nuria Monfort, who is a complex character who adds much depth to the story, especially as Daniel unravels several mysteries.<br /><br />Not all is perfect with the novel, however, and the book loses some of its mystical quality at certain points. Much of this comes when Daniel’s sidekick, Fermin, comes into the story. Fermin offers some comic relief, but has a court jester-like quality to him. He is initially fun, but becomes annoying as the novel progresses, and seems to “dumb down” and lessen the intrigue factor. Another issue is with the over-the-top villainy, so overdone that I could literally envision the main antagonist twisting his mustache with his fingers all the while plotting and laughing maniacally. Some of the male characters, particularly the fathers of the children, are carbon copies of each other, almost interchangeable.<br /><br />This aside, though, The Shadow of the Wind is well worth the read, a book I highly recommend for those who like mystery, suspense or the Gothic tradition. It’s also a book about books, another plus in my, ahem, book. It’s a novel that pulls you in, and makes you interested in the protagonist’s fate. As other have attested, this is a book encompassing so many elements and themes that it has a wide range of appeal. There’s something for everyone in this reading experience.ic relief, but has a court jester-like quality to him.

1616614609|5.0|Netrunner is a two-player game in which one person plays as the corporation and the other as the runner - a hacker trying to infiltrate the corporation's secure network.  The first person to score seven agenda points (all of which are initially hidden in the corporation's deck) wins.<br /><br />There are several reasons that this game has received such high praise.  First, it is a living card game, which means that the publisher, Fantasy Flight Games, releases the game in sets with fixed distributions - when you buy an expansion, you know exactly what you're getting.  Compared to collectable card games, this makes Netrunner much more affordable.<br /><br />Second, the game play is intense.  As the defensive player, the corporation is working to quickly establish ICE to prevent the runner from accessing his/her servers: the corporation's deck, hand, discard pile, or remote servers - all of which could contain agendas.  As the offensive player, the runner is trying to break through these defenses, or use surprises to sneak past them.  It's a game of cat-and-mouse, with a lot of opportunity of hidden knowledge.<br /><br />Third, the trickery is top-notch.  Cards that the runner accesses might be traps or ambushes that harm the runner.  Cards that appear to be agendas might be extremely dangerous booby traps and could end the game if the runner is forced to discard more cards than she/he has in hand.  On the other hand, the runner has four actions each turn instead of three.  If the runner can bring out an ICE-breaker on the first action to bypass a particularly nasty piece of ICE, he/she has three more actions to spend accessing that server.  This is devastating to the corporation.<br /><br />Fourth, the game is fast.  If you lose, the shame is lessened by the fact that you spent 30 minutes playing, and your opponent is probably excited for another round.<br /><br />I really enjoy Netrunner, and I look forward to playing for many years to come.  The third data pack (small expansion) was only recently released, and with such a small card pool, it has had a major impact on the game already!all expansion) was only recently released, and with such a small card pool, it has had a major impact on the game already!

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I always read reviews stating what a great storyteller Follett is and while I think I have read all his books and felt similarly I think this book is the best. It was such a great read, completely believable and captivating from beginning to end. I have owned the book both in hardcover and digital copy for quite some time and I am sorry I took so long to read it. I love all the characters, both good and bad, I found the overlay of story lines while consistent with his style very enjoyable and the perfect spacing between each. I would recommend anyone read this book and I am going to start reading the sequel... Hope it's just as engaging.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|VERY complex main characters that draw you into the story and will not let you go!  The main character shows her dark side and frailty in this final installment.  Author does a good job of showing how war affects one emotionally!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Another great book in the series. This author has a great vocabulary and really has a way with words. I highly recommend this series.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Read this a the recommendation of a friend.  The plot is futuristic but that gives the author great latitude to create world perfect for his storyline.  This book has much to say to our currect image-driven culture.  I liked the whole series!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Not only fun stuff like Thriftstore, but amazingly deep tracks like Same Love. Macklemore is the whip. So, so so good
B004LROUNG|3.0|It's a Grisham, but not one of his better ones.  If you like lawyers that drink too much and live on the edge of failure, you'll like this one.  Found it a bit unrealistic at times.  Almost gave up on Grisham books after this one, but his follow-up to this one kept me a fan.
141659521X|3.0|This is one of Flynn’s best novels. Built around the mess we have created in Afghanistan and Pakistan: reintegration, green-on-blue attacks; Taliban waiting to for us to leave; conflicting agendas of the state department, CIA, liberals in Congress and the president, with our military caught in the middle. The Last Man is a good spy story featuring the duplicity of Pakistan’s ISI and well though out twists and turns.<br /><br />No one has commented on the fact that oxygen tanks do not explode (page 128), nor that Wilson’s dog changed sex at the end of the story. I found the exploding oxygen tanks a plot spoiler, because the explosion was a major element of the plot. Flynn should have come up with a better solution—mixing propane and oxygen tanks vented by bullets and then ignited, or discovering a stockpile of dynamite or explosives in the clinic. This error is the reason for my 3 stars instead of 4.<br /><br />That said, The Last Man is a good read.
B00BEU6JVY|5.0|Great CD, totally enjoyed the music. Played some tracks at a event last night. Several people said, &#34;That sounds like th Moody Blues !

B001N44BVQ|5.0|I see this one over and over, whenever life seems slow.  It feels real.<br /><br />James Bond-types do exist and work for the CIA, among others, employed by Special Ops.  These guys are ex-SEALS, Marine Recon, DELTA Force, etc,  Super athletes with advanced university degrees and language qualifications. They're further trained at Langley, Quantico and elsewhere for at least a year before being sent into the field.<br /><br />This picture is about one-such.  You can't beat Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio for this type of role(Matt Damon, move over!).<br /><br />I can't understand why BODY OF LIES didn't do better business at the box office.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Written content was excellent. Images are un-expandable, therefore practically unusable on a black and white Kindle. They were acceptable on a 10.1&#34; tablet computer.<br />Makers of e-books really must do something to make zoom function on images and tables.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|MIB has hopefully seen it's last chapter in the franchise. I loved the first 2 and I liked this one as well but it felt tired. The same jokes and considerably more exaggerated takes on the characters. Jemaine Clement however saved this movie from 3 stars for me. He was perfect as the bad guy and has that campy feel that makes the MIB movies so good

B005LAIHZE|3.0|This movie was a huge let down. I was SO excited to see it after enjoying every page of the book. BUT shame on me for thinking this movie would be different than the many movies that have paled in comparison to the book. I'm not sure why they made the plot changes they did but it wasnt as good. And of course they thought more explosions would improve the story.....not at all.
0743487486|5.0|It was more of a self help book for me than a parenting book. I had so many ah-ha moments about my own life I had to stop, reflect, correct my thinking from my own upbringing and move forward. If I had one criticism it was that the author should stick to sociology and stay away from politics. His political slant seemed narrow minded and might drive conservative (politically) readers away from an otherwise incredible book, philosophy and study. Many kudos!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I read all of the books before I saw the movie, and while the books are sort of prequels to the movie, the movie was not a disappointment at all, which often comes from a book to movie adaptation. It's a little dark at parts and I was a little surprised how dark they let a childrens movie get, but in general it was just a great movie. The animation is beautiful and the story is just as good. A must see! Especially with the kids!
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I gave 4 out of 5 because they are twice as thick then the original so if I had been using only one of the original instead of two, they would not fit. But they worked out fine.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I was, like probably most people, a little worried about how a Bourne movie could possibly work without Jason Bourne in it. However! Be not afraid! It turned out wonderfully. A good addition to the franchise even if it was Matt Damon-less. I was hoping maybe for a cameo but I guess it would have been hard to have him pop up without having to give him a more significant role. I still prefer the original 3 but I would not complain at all if they made more with Jeremy Renner

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found the piano guys via a suggested for you on youtube and was instantly hooked. The intensity, the fantastic sound and the look of enjoyment both Jon and Steve have while they play make them a joy to watch. Now I have their fabulous CD to listen to whenever and wherever I want.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a really fresh, entertaining, and uncomplicated movie.  Just fun to watch.  Love the acapella.  Outstanding singing & dancing by the real actors/actresses!  Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow are awesome.
B00285K1KE|1.0|Until the credits were about halfway threw.<br /> I have NEVER sat so long threw a movie, wanting to rip my hair out. I can honestly say that the ONLY reason I finished it was because I knew it was so incredibly bad that it would be easy to compare it to the newer hulk movie for my essay paper. Stan Lee should want to kill these people- They couldn't even get that name of Bruce Banner's father right!! And changing his last name? stupid. SOOOOO stupid.<br /> What an incredible waste of money and time. Now I know I have this essay in the bag- But come on.<br /> Eric Bana's 'Mad face' was childish at BEST.<br /> The ONLY reason I'm not asking for my 3 dollars back is because I know it won't do me any good. I watched the movie. Now I must suffer for it.<br /> But the essay is in the bag.<br /><br /> ...what a bad movie. I've watched B movies that were better. I've watched 90 films that were better. This is as bad as nipple Batman.<br /> ....I need to just... wow. What a bad movie.<br /> And SOMEONE needs to kill whoever came up with the idea of putting the picture inside the picture.<br /> And Betty would NEVER EVER throw Bruce under the bus like that. Did any of you even READ the comic books?<br /> ....just kill me. This is such a bad movie. I can't believe I watched it again.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Enjoyed this movie but not as much as Sixteen Candles, still love Molly Ringwald great actor. Will keep on ordering from you.
0425263908|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THESE BOOKS. SYLVIA DAY IS A BRILLIANT AUTHOR AND  I HOPE THAT SHE CAN COME UP WITH A GOOD SOLUTION FOR GIDEON AND EVA.  I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR BOOK #3 TO COME OUT AND I HOPE THAT EVA GETS TO KICK  CHRISTOPHER'S BUTT. BRAVO TO SYLVIA  FOR THESE BOOKS.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I expected the typical love story that has made Sparks famous. What I got was a daring surprise. The best I've read from Sparks.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I was bored and made a mistake by thinking this movie would be even remotely entertaining. I would not recommend.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I took a chance on oedering this movie. Everyone said it was good I am very glad I did one of my new favorite movies. I recommend this to any teen or adult.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy the pace of the storyline, fashion, scenery,etc. There appears to be interface between servants and titled with heart felt genuinely felt fondness.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I really like this game because it's challenging and fun! It really is a concentrating game! I hope there's a Lep's World 3!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I love Denzel Washington. This was one of his best films. It kept me interested from the beginning. Great film just not for little ones.... :-)
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I was stunned at the end of this book absolutely shocked at how sad and just effected by it I was if you wanna cry read this!!
0060594888|5.0|I have both the hardcover and the audio version. I have listened to the audio book well over 50 times. The book is so good that I give as gifts to young adults as they progress on their journey to success, and they love it..
B004H83IM8|5.0|the thrilling austin is back but this time at a steal is it Christmas already. i got this because i love the Austin powers movies
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|i recommed this to anyone wheather you have even seen this before<br />now I own it for ever thank's a lot
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Saw the movie, and a friend has read all the novels, which I haven't. Starting at #1, the read is quick, and the plot albiet somewhat predictable, is a fun ride.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|The mechanism for this game involves tilting your device to keep your marble on the obstacle course. The graphics and music are nice. I think the game would be enjoyable if it weren't for the tilt controls. There's a huge delay when you tilt, which can lead you to overreact or not react enough when moving between platforms. There needs to be a way to calibrate the sensitivity of the tilt control.
1933952806|5.0|Comprehensive and well written.  You can tell these folks know their stuff across the board.  I was relieved that the configuration settings were explained so well as this camera is very complex.  Highly recommended as a supplement to the owners manual and a reference guide.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|i watched 1.11 and 2.22<br />i like it!<br />want to see 3.33 stories<br />but i cant find 3.33 DVD of evangerion<br />where can i find 3.33 DVD?
0062082353|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  I'm a bit of a sniper book guy starting with Marine Sniper by Carlos Hathcock when I was a kid.  This is very different from that book just as our Mideast wars are very different from Vietnam.<br /><br />The book is more of an interview style.  You can tell that Chris Kyle is telling his stories to the author as is his wife.  While there are many story lines within this book, it is a very good beginning to end account of what got him into the SEALs, how they operate, and what encompassed his time in the four tours he went through.<br /><br />There is a point when you may believe that his cavalier attitude to sniping is uncaring but then you realize that much of that is his way of dealing with his job.  We (yes, you and I paid for it) trained this man to go overseas, invade a foreign nation and protect our troops from the bad guys.  This is a tough job and unless we have had to do it, we cannot judge the individuals doing it.<br /><br />If you are interested in this genre and enjoy anything having to do with the SEALs or snipers then I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow now that was a book I couldn't put down had to finish reading it.. Thank you DO James.....I want sure I would like these books but after finally reading them I am so glade I did...
B00530FC6O|5.0|I suppose there's a bad Jeeves novel but I haven't read it yet.  Jeeves, the omniscient manservant who runs his employer's life is a great invention, but the genius (for me) is Bertie Wooster's first-person narration -- clueless, vapid, basically decent, terrified of his aunts, hapless around women, totally devoid of any social sense.  Righty-ho, one of the landmarks of first-person writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game ... Glad I  play this game to pass by time!! BUT now I can't stop playing even when I do have something to do ... ADDICTIVE!!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The movie is an engrossing visual treat. I went from laughing to horrified to terrified to tears, and could believe it all. The Amazon Instant HD video stream is superb and smooth.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game for all ages. To waste time and work on hand eye coordination. I like the game a lot it is actually really fun. but to but new people is really expensive 95,000!! and 50,000 for the boards?? foreal?
B008BU70HW|5.0|Don't know what I expected but lots of background info that I was not aware of because I had not yet watched Season One or Two.  I'm watching them now but still like the little fill-in things by the actors/actresses!  I bought the hard book for my cousin and she loves it.  I have not seen yet but she said it was a beautiful book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. It has good graphics and is so addictive, it is fun but challenging and offers a lot of quality for no price. Get this game!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It's a lot like Sparks' book, Safe Haven. Logan is a treasure to be found. It was hard to put the book down, and it ended with a satisfying conclusion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a great game you should make a second one I especially like that the whole family can play.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this is a really great game. It's fun to pretend that you have a horse. You can play games and win awards.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very very very fun game I love it I hope you will love it to enjoy the game if you download it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Beautiful book. So very touching to your heart. It really shows you that no matter what you look like, people will always love  you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best  app ever I haven't had any problems with it yet . I recommend you get this app
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|It did not disappoint of course. I am a huge fan of Downton and will in the future order each season on DVD.  Love the show, love how fast it was shipped to me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very good update from temple run the first one  there's gold mines and New characters and bigger monkey
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to  watch the movie. This book was so great to read and they were meant for each other.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|This app is not worth the money I couldn't open up any of files this is a very big disappointment to me
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This is just what I was looking for for my Kindle Fire, it makes reading so much easier.  The stand/cover has many adjustable positions, and is secure.  Love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book pissed me off. I don`t care about the bad writing, if I really care about a book I can get over it and sometimes love it more than my propperly written stories with no soul. My anger with this is how the author handles the subject matter. As a victim off chidhood rape I am normally a big fan of books like this I get to cry, laugh, and let emotions out that are not that easy to let go of. However this book just pissed me off! The guy... I think his name was Holder is an effing creep. He is the kind of guy who learns your story is &#34;there for you&#34; then if you stay with them and have kids down the line does the same thing to them. Granted a lot of women tend to end up in this cycle and that is a sad fact. Also you don`t &#34;remember&#34; rape and just fall into bed with someone IT RARELY HAPPENS. This book made me sick. Good thing I borrowed it or I`d of felt ripped off. As it stands now it only robbed my time.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I love this headset/mic. This is the only one i've used for about 3 years now. It's comfy the sound quality is amazing and it looks really slick.
B001EBWING|4.0|I really enjoyed Casablanca!  I have a great grandfather who was a Russian Orthodox Jew.  He fled to Portugal and then to Hawaii.  Tough times for many people back then!
B001F0WXY0|5.0|If you've put off reading this book, do yourself a favor and dive into this amazing sci-fi masterpiece. Complex rich characters, deceit, treason, religion, and logic, drive this page turner right up there to the top of the mist read list; where it has been for decades now. Go and prevaricate no more!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I'm only in the middle of it, it but it's really good. I think that this book is slot like The Hunger Games.
B00004CY38|1.0|The dvd won't even play in xbox or dvd player, I wait for this!!! Waste of money wasn't the issue just hate I had to wait so long to find out it was garbage!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a fun game that involves strategy and quick thinking. Love it! The different people are really uhh cool.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It is crystal clear and looks great over my white Iphone 4s. You cant beat the price for this simple, sleek case as it also includes a screen protector. There is even a lip around the front of the case to protect the front of the phone from falls. Well worth ever penny for the aesthetics, simplistic, and effective design.<br /><br />* I plan to update once I drop the phone to let everyone know how it fares through that test as well.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love Fruit Ninja! It is fun and entertaining. I like all of the different blades and backgrounds in it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The best game ever invented since the early years of my life .I rate this game a 10 with no regrets
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|this book is the star of a extremely entirely awesome and nice  it would be a  very good  conversation starter
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am nearing the completion of this classic centered in France.  I definitely am enjoying the book again, with some difficulty with following all of the names - historical, and otherwise.
B0074EIQUG|1.0|As a person who first saw Dr. John as The Night Tripper in the 1970's, this is almost an unlistenable album for me.  It has no funk and too clearly shows itself as a product of Dan Auerbach (Black Keys) who just shouldn't be getting so much credit for their interpretation of the blues.  How can Doctor John represent his Nahlin's heritage while playing this rock pablum?  Whew!  There are a couple of tunes that have a hint of the good ol' Doctor e.g. Ice Age but the recording just doesn't let you get deep into it.  There is too much of a pop lightness for my liking.  Auerbach does a decent solo on Getaway but you know you've heard it before.  And what is \\"You Lie\\"?  Please.  That is just sad.  I must say that I like a little of the spooky sound of the Farfisa(?) keyboard sound on some tunes but overall, this one is not what I expect from a man of Dr. John's pedigree.  I might, just might respect this a little more if it had been a Auerbach CD with Dr. John as a guest.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This book  is so good for children. I loved this book an I think your children will enjoy this book I did and I'm only 12 and I  still loved this book!!
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I really liked the singles Imagine Dragons released, however, when compiled into an album, they just don't make any sense together.  Night Visions lacks a consistent style - for example, &#34;It's Time&#34; has a more indie feel to it where &#34;I'm on Top of the World&#34; seems to have a Jamaican influence.  I wish I had just purchased the singles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is fun and cool and exitongg because it easy at first and gets harder and then u can earn different stuff and change characters
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love how this app tells you how long you have to do different functions on your Kindle.  It's good to know I don't have enough power to watch an entire 2hour movie.  This app fulfills all my needs.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Absolutely love this game. The graphics and the story make for a great game so far. The free game options has definitely made up my mind to purchase. Great fun unlike other games where you can nearly see them, this one let's you zoom right in.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I've been playing this game for one year. I confess I'm addicted. It's a fun easy time killer. I've spent very little real money. I highly reccomend it!
B00A77II0U|4.0|graphics were great. at times the lighting during the item search made finding a bit difficult. overall a hood game
B009GED3HS|4.0|Season 8 of How I Met Your Mother contains some great storylines, including information that takes us closer to the big reveal of Ted's future wife. However, there are some episodes that make it seem as if the writers are just marking time between sweeps months.
0307346617|5.0|This book was very entertaining and hard to put down. The format of many interviews managed to convey a story that forced the reader to put together the overall message on their own.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a free, addictive game that is my new poison. I play the game almost everyday! Its that good! I highly reccomend this game to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book was pretty good, but I definitely didn't get all I hoped for. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought this book at first was slow and then at the end i read for three or four hours and ended the book and couldn't wait to read the next sea monsters
B000AQJPQE|2.0|Great idea but the rotation feature doesn't work.  Based on other reviews, it does not seem likely that a replacement would work any better.  Not a bad 10 minute night light or ceiling decoration though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't get past the first 2 pages. I had just reread Lady Chatterley's Lover for the first time since my youth and was so impressed with the writing and statement of the culture of the period, that I thought I should read Grey and compare the statement of the culture for our current time.  I was horrified by the comparison. I tried to hold myself together and found more DH Lawrence for my Kindle.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Love being able to watch all the episodes back to back without interruption.  Never watch prime tv so this is great.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a fun book to read.  Takes your mind off the regular day of reality.  I really enjoyed the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very enjoyable to watch, great plot line.  I love that it follows the servants along with the family with different plot lines.
B002OSY2T6|1.0|This was not what I expected. It was a piece of plastic that didn't really serve a purpose. The mirror is small and not useful. The product didn't live up to expectations.
075669812X|5.0|My kids love this!  It is very detailed and shares a ton of information!  My son brings this to me to read to him all the time!!!
B005NS0VNU|5.0|Its R.E.M. Need I say more. 2 many classic R.E.M. tracks on this C.D. to even began to list. Each & every song tells a story. And to top that off, the CD insert tells a story on each song. When & where it was written plus the mindset as to why it was written. A must have classic of hits that will please anyone that has had the pleasure of seeing them live. Brings back many fond memory's from start to end.
0375869026|4.0|My 10 yr old grandson actually enjoyed reading this book!  Grammy's attempt to read for pleasure worked with this book.<br />Thank you R.J. Palacio!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Great C.D. with a nice mix of Studio & Live recordings. This CD Collection was very much worth the price. Includes his remix versions of My Girl, True Colors & his greater hits from his solo career. I already own everything from Genesis, so this was a very special treat for me.<br />Thanks for Auto Rip. Was able to Jam before shipment arrived.
076781326X|5.0|My grandaughter was in a play at school which was GREAT she never saw the movie so I thought I would get it for her to watch and she just loved it !!!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|What disappointment and a waste of $4 dollars. The story was shallow, the acting was poor, character development sucked, a lot of violence and blood. It was ironic that we kept checking the clock every 20 minutes to see how much longer it would go on for. So even with all of the violence and action it seemed to go on longer than a lot of the current movies that are over 2.5 hours.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great movie all of my kids really enjoyed it and so did I.  I would highly recommend it to everyone
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I just finished the second book and still in ah! I think it took me appropriately 4 to 6 days to finish both. Now to the last book, kind of sad it is the last one.

B003O86FMW|2.0|This book was worse than reading about the Nazis in WWII or the KGB after that.  No hope, only despair.  I guess that is why I never felt a connection to the main character, Katniss.  Whatever redeeming qualities she had were lost in the utter hopelessness of the arena.  I know that war and totalitarian oppression is horrible and all too often a reality in this fallen world that we live in.  But this is fiction not reality.  It reminds me of the mindless horror movies that Hollywood churns out.  It's all about what can we shock you with next.  By the end of the book I was just hoping Katniss would drop dead so I wouldn't have to listen to her crazy reasoning.  In fictional books I prefer having some kind of hope by the main character.  Katniss just seems completely lost most of the time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is much better than the space angry birds game..just waiting for the next one!  I hope it comes out soon
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I adored every page of this book. It's great to read a novel where each of the characters are working their brains to maximum capacity for a positive outcome. Each \\"mental elevator soared all the way to the top,\\" in a very entertaining fashion. Technically and scientifically fastidious, the story is absorbing and delightfully nerve-racking. I found the humor to be witty and appropriate, and even laughed out loud several times at Weir's/ Watney's great one-liners. What would happen if a brilliant engineer was marooned on Mars, and developed a dogged will to live, awaiting a possible rescue? This novel puts you there, and I became physically anxious as the novel neared its nail-biting conclusion. My only issue: What is with the typos? There were many of them, and they were distracting. I was confused as to why a line editor hadn't seemed to step in and fix them all before the novel went to print. Regardless, this is a supremely crafted science fiction (?) thriller. Highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I loved the game irself. Great graphics, good storyline and tricky puzzles but not so tricky you are tempted to throw your Kindle in frustration. I took away one star because I had to pay $4.99 halfway through to unlock the game. I would rather just pay for a game up front. The other star I took away because right after I bought it the game crashed. I had to remove it, reload and start all over.
0440539811|1.0|\\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\\" is the annoyingly punctuated book series by two former \\"Playboy\\" writers (apparently they had writers--the world before the Internet is weird) who decided it would be fun to imagine a world where all conspiracy theories are true. It is not fun.<br /><br />I read the first in the series, \\"The Eye in the Pyramid\\" and I'm shocked there are two more books. The first one seems to have every single word in the English language (thrown onto pages in near-random combinations). It's hard to imagine where the authors could go from here. The book has more problems than characters, and that's saying something.<br /><br />PROBLEM #1: Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson must have done ALL of the drugs known to man before/while writing this book. It switches narrative styles, tenses, time frames, and from real to hallucinated scenes almost constantly, sometimes even in the middle of sentences.<br /><br />Reading this book is like being tortured by Big Brother in \\"1984.\\" They keep hammering you with phrases that don't make sense and contract each other and eventually you cry and give up and say whatever they want to make it stop. \\"The Illuminatus Trilogy\\" is a lot like having rats crawling on your face.<br /><br />PROBLEM #2: The language is off putting. Specifically, the N-word, which they really seem to enjoy. Oh and the C-word, which also appears on almost every page. Oh and several other words that start with letters. I know the 70s were a different time but presumably racism, sexism, and homophobia were all problematic back then too. Right? Please tell me I'm right.<br /><br />PROBLEM #3: The sex is really disturbing. I know the Roberts used to write for \\"Playboy\\" but this seems gross even for them. The sex is gratuitous and almost always gross (masturbating in prison, having a dead body ejaculate onto a guy from a great height, and having sex with a giant apple's \\"vagina\\").<br /><br />This book ruined sex for me. Really. I'm never doing it again. I'm done. If anybody has any math problems they need solved, I've got a free brain cycle every 8 seconds now so I can probably help you out.<br /><br />PROBLEM  #4: I don't get it. If you loved these books you're probably going to say \\"It's satire. You just didn't get it.\\" And you're right. I really didn't. And I tried. I wanted to get it so bad. It might not be gettable.<br /><br />Maybe there were some political situations in the 70s I don't understand that had to do with apples not getting enough sex. Until somebody fills in that information, I've been to frat parties with more to say about world events.<br /><br />PROBLEM #5: It's not well edited. I, for example, would have cut out the middle 3/4, insisted the Roberts focused on 1 of the 100 story lines, and gotten rid of the talking/singing dolphin entirely. Oh, and all the sex. Come to think of it, it might not have been edited at all.<br /><br />There are more problems (the drugs, the lack of any non-prostitute female characters, and the self-referential nonsense that only shows they knew the book wasn't good) but I'm going to do something the Roberts never did: exercise self-restraint.<br /><br />If you want to read an offensive, absurdist free-verse poem about the sex lives of crazy people that will make you confused and angry, I recommend this book. Otherwise, I advise you to read/do pretty much anything else.m done. If anybody has any math problems they need solved, I've got a free brain cycle every 8 seconds now so I can probably help you out.<br /><br />PROBLEM  #4: I don't get it. If you loved these books you're probably going to say \\"It's satire. You just didn't get it.\\" And you're right. I really didn't. And I tried. I wanted to get it so bad. It might not be gettable.<br /><br />Maybe there were some political situations in the 70s I don't understand that had to do with apples not getting enough sex. Until somebody fills in that information, I've been to frat parties with more to say about world events.<br /><br />PROBLEM #5: It's not well edited. I, for example, would have cut out the middle 3/4, insisted the Roberts focused on 1 of the 100 story lines, and gotten rid of the talking/singing dolphin entirely. Oh, and all the sex. Come to think of it, it might not have been edited at all.<br /><br />There are more problems (the drugs, the lack of any non-prostitute female characters, and the self-referential nonsense that only shows they knew the book wasn't good) but I'm going to do something the Roberts never did: exercise self-restraint.<br /><br />If you want to read an offensive, absurdist free-verse poem about the sex lives of crazy people that will make you confused and angry, I recommend this book. Otherwise, I advise you to read/do pretty much anything else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is a great one. it has great graphics and is fun for everyone. it was definitely worth my time and money.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Terrific family kind of show. The characters are terrific and their development is great. I also like that it is rather short
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is an awesome addition to the series. Martin's world is so beautiful and brutal that it's almost hard to keep reading after losing a character that you grow so close to.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Not used as often as I used to.  So, it isn't helpful like it used to be.  Cant take it back now.....
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|Lately Steven Wilson (and his buddy Mikeal Akerfedlt) has had this strange love affair with dark 70s progressive music.  No doubt Mr. Wilson has always been obsessed with prog music - his early porcupine tree stuff was clearly influenced by Pink Floyd  - but more recently he's been less discrete with his homages.  Insurgents, his first album, had a sound that seemed all to him and his band Porcupine Tree.  His next album still had that definitive Steven Wilson sound, yet on certain songs things were a bit off.  There were times on Grace for Drowning when it stopped sounding like the guy we knew and started sounding like a cheap King Crimson rip off.  That might sound a bit harsh, but you must keep in mind that I don't really like dark 70s proggessive rock, so seeing one of my favorite artists emulate it made me a little miffed.  Still though, Grace for Drowning had many great tracks, as well as a few of the mellow tracks that Mr. Wilson does so well.<br /><br />This album is a different story.  It's completely 100% unapologetic about copying this dark 70s prog rock sound.  For a guy like me that doesn't like this stuff, this album was a huge letdown.  Way too many tracks sound like Steven Wilson listened to a bunch of old albums and copied and pasted the notes onto this record.  This kind of crap bums me out.  I like Steven Wilson and his music, but this new sound just doesn't work for me.  It doesn't sound like the Steven I know.<br /><br />This album does have a couple pluses.  The drumming and bass are exceptional.  Even on the tracks that I hated I just had to sit in awe at the skills of Mr. Minneman and Mr. Beggs.  They are fantastically talented musicians.  Two other pluses are the tracks \\"Drive Home\\" and \\"The Raven That Refused To Sing\\".  These tracks are fantastic throwbacks to the good ol' Steven Wilson sound we've all come to know and love.  \\"Drive Home\\" is the classic Steven Wilson ballad ala Porcupine Tree's \\"Prodigal\\" and \\"The Raven That Refused to Sing\\" is the classic Steven Wilson epic finish pieces ala \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\".  Both songs are welcome throwbacks to a time when Steven Wilson wasn't nearly as dark prog obsessed.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you don't like dark 70s prog you won't like most of this album.  Buy \\"Drive Home\\" and \\"The Raven That Refused to Sing\\" instead.
B006H4DBA4|3.0|It's okay for a short read but in all honesty I have come to expect better from sophie kinsella. Feel her novel length stories are much better written.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|He is a great author of historical books.  His research is the best.<br />The story flows without seeming like a history book.<br />I love everything he writes.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This game takes forever to load if it loads at all. I never have a problem with any of my games .
B007EECSFA|3.0|I guess I expected more.<br />The suspense was held to the end & it was very understandable.<br />This is the 2nd book I've read by Kate Morton, & I would guess that she is not one of my favorite writers.
B0086700CM|5.0|new to the kindle fire.  my new eye glasses are not in yet so i can see the games easily not the books.  i have found the game enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and i can play it hours on end. I would recommend this app to others. It is worth downloading.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|i am a big fan of tim mcgraw so i purchased this film.  i was very happy with this video.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|When I downloaded this app it was really fun, but then the app LOST ALL OF MY PROGRESS!!! I had the Rio specials and a bunch of other characters and then I had to start all over again. Its a fun game if all your progress doesn't get stripped away from you.
0425166805|5.0|a gift to my husband.  he enjoyed all of the books written by this well known author. he enjoyed the read
0618918248|5.0|A must read for any science minded individual, no matter your discipline. This book is an instant classic leaving you excited to be living in such an amazing time in history.
B0063M22QO|5.0|i have become hooked on this game. it is better than the one on my laptop.  it is great fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keeps you pushing yourself to try t poo beat your last high score and yours friend's records. Great for little kids too.
B004EK91LQ|5.0|I loved the movie because it shows how you can take people from all over and put them together, have then live together and eventually they become a family and will do anything for each other!! It's amazing and really great dancing
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I'm only part way through this book so far and it's great.  As an IT consultant, it's nice to have a book which is technically accurate, though we'd expect no less from Mr. Russinovich.  Well written, with an interesting story, I am quite enjoying reading this!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This isn't just a book of anecdotes about former and current Presidents, nor is it an overvnew of the American Presidency. What it is is a compelling compendium of specific Presidents and their relationships with their predecessors and successors, often forged in the midst of significant crises at home and/or abroad. TIME's Gibbs and Duffy have done such intense research that the usual adjective applied here, &#34;extensive,&#34; doesn't begin to cover it. Their sources include some of the Presidents themselves, their memoirs, significant materials from their libraries, their former staffers, Cabinet officials, and colleagues. I am persuaded that many readers will revise their opinions of the character of not one, but several former Presidents, based on the ways they interact with and respond to one another. In some cases the evidence shows acts of incredible sensitivity, grace, and kindness; while in others one is appalled by selfish, childish stubbornness, self-aggrandizing words and acts, and impetuous behavior so extreme as to risk the integrity of the United States itself. But still these fall short, because there are definite acts of sedition and treason revealed here in some detail. All these elements combine to make it read like a novel, even while one's eyes are opened anew to how much goes on behind the scenes in Washington, even in this age of 24/7 media coverage amplified by social media. As the child of Republican parents, I remember well going around our mid-size North Carolina town in the early 50's, handing out dozens of &#34;I Like Ike and Dick&#34; buttons. Good, kind, genial Ole Grandpa Ike comes off as a bit of a jerk, while Tricky Dick Nixon, later of Watergate infamy, turned out to be a real pal, adviser and confidante to Presidents of both parties. The &#34;Best Former President&#34; Jimmy Carter of my adult Democrat years turns out to be often petulant, self-serving, and more than deserving of prosecution. Not surprisingly, whether or not thePresident was born with a silver spoon in his mouth or raised in poverty has little effect on their personalities as revealed in their relationships one with another. Read this book not just for its &#34;juicy tidbits,&#34; but to see these most powerful men in the world as they are known by the only people who are their equals - each other. We encounter herein a wide range of humanity, from the grandest gesture to the tawdriest comment, all in the interactions of the men in this most exclusive of clubs. This is a must-read for anyone who follows national politics and seeks insights on how we might best choose these folk who wield such power on our behalf.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I would probably recommend this book but I wasn't overly enthusiastic about it.  Some parts were totally unbelieveable like how much she was nursing that baby.  I did enjoy learning the meaning of the differnt kinds of flowers, that was interesting.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|After teaching for 30 years, I have found some of the ideas that Carol writes about to be dead on for what I see as one of the biggest challenges in teaching today.  Students see a disconnect between effort and accomplishment.  I think this is in part due to the emphasis on self-esteem over the last 20 or so years.  I&#34;m all for self-esteem.  But if it is not related to anything a person does it builds up a false sense of self.  The kids who have been taught that they earn their self esteem by their efforts, do much better.
030758836X|3.0|I find the author's obsession with this topic, and those of the two prior books disturbing. However after I said I would not read it, I did. But I probably wouldn't again.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Challenging jewels game. Music could be better. For a free game, the ads are unobtrusive. Its a great time killer.
0345803493|4.0|This book took Grey's and Ana's relationship in a new direction which was interesting but I had to think about it. One problem I had, which almost made me give it three stars, is that there was constant reiteration of how he affected her. Enough already. Understanding the field of Psychology, I am interested to see where this goes. I accept the relationship so far but with some misgivings. Have yet to read &#34;Freed.&#34; It may change my view of this novel.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|3/2/2013<br /><br />The movie was amazing when seen in IMAX 3D with the high frame rate. The people whining about headaches from the FPS are incomprehensible; if you've played a video game in the last 10 years you've seen things at 60FPS which is way higher than this. Some old-fashioned folks just don't like change I suppose.<br /><br />The substance was good, I'm not going to put any spoilers in here, but there are some scenes not in the books or scenes that have been rearranged. Some work but there are some that will have you rolling your eyes wondering why it was stuck in. For the most part I just loved the atmosphere of the movie because the cinematography and music were spectacular. It made me fall in love with Jackson's Middle Earth all over again and you may not remember, but it's almost been a decade since the last LOTR movie came out and I forgot how much I loved/missed it.<br /><br />The key scenes of the movie are done perfectly and that's really what lets me forgive the rough edges.<br /><br />Martin Freeman did a fantastic job with Bilbo and really shows the burgeoning maturity of the character. I also liked the portrayal of the dwarves in such a positive and proud way. In the previous movies, Gimli was used a bit too much as comic relief but this story shows Thorin as a proud and prickly character and this is his story as much as Bilbo's.<br /><br />Overall 4/5 because there are things that could have been cut to make for a better movie, but otherwise it's good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is why I love my kindle.  Best si-fi I've ever read.  I got introduced by reading the short story.  And 5 books for 5 bucks?  Can't beat that.  Hope they make a movie out of this book one day.  Looking for more books from this author.
B0035JNRXU|4.0|For Star Trek affectionados (Trekkers) this movie does use the Prime Directive concept as an element of the story, but rather, puts it up front and center by raising the stakes.  In this film, we see a small colony of aliens enjoying long healthy lives because of an exploitable phenomena .  If it is exploited, the small group which is not native to the planet looses their homes and their longevity, but Earthers gets the benefit of living longer and healthier lives.  This brings the top Federation leaders into direct conflict between their own mortal desires and morale guidelines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer on the kindle because you don't have to tilt like temple run,  so you can play on your kindle! Also when you update you change your location but still keep you score and coin amount.
B0059A149C|5.0|In this movie, you follow the crew of the Memphis Belle as they fly their last mission.  Dumb luck, they get a nasty dangerous target deep inside Germany and fly through a real hell to get there, do the job and get back.  The flying scenes are excellent, but the ensemble of young actors portraying the crew were casted and directed very well.  Their performances draw you into their world of death and struggle.  As war films go, this will long be a classic like the Longest Day, which ebbed back and forth in popularity over the years, but endures.
1616550414|5.0|was the best birthday gift ever ! she loves the color and detail on all the characters ! one happy child
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I ordered this blu-ray dvd new and at a good price from the seller. I had heard many kudos regarding this movie and was unable to locate it to rent on Netflix or Redbox. I was anxious to watch it with my family so I ordered it! I received it in a timely manner and would order from the seller again! Thanks

B0052TDGQO|5.0|I chose this rating as my husband and I loved Scotty on American Idol and were so thrilled that he won it! He has such a beautiful voice, and is very successful as a Christian young person! This DVD has some good music on it and we actually purchased his Christmas DVD as well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little app that does what it says for free. I use it all the time on my Kindle Fire.
0896898288|3.0|My Civil War quilt group decided to use this book for individually making quilts. I love the quilt stories and the many choices of quilt blocks as well. However, there are NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to construct the quilt blocks! I have been disappointed in that one is left to their own devices to figure out how to put the blocks together! I would recommend the seller as I bought the book as like new/used and it arrived in a timely fashion and is in good condition. However, I am a person who likes to &#34;follow instructions&#34; using a pattern/specific instructions. Thanks!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked this movie, especially the &#34;old ways are often the best ways&#34; theme. Great villain as well.  Daniel Craig is getting comfortable in the Bond role.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just started watching this a few months ago and I'm hooked.  I love the storylines of all the characters.  I'm not a big fan of television shows, but this one keeps me wanting more.  It's a beautiful setting and I love the era this takes place.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I wanna make a bet myself  jaja!  I sorta derailed me towards the middle-end but it was still a great book !
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks! He makes every book real. Always seems like every character is real and not fairy tale.
B004J64QSI|5.0|You've seen the show on Broadway or West End.  You've watched the 2012 movie.  Do you really need this 25th anniversary show?<br /><br />YES! Let the voices and the music move you -- again.<br /><br />(PS Only weak link here is the person who played Marius.)

B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting read written in a quirky style with a somewhat predicable story line.  My expectations were high based on previous reviews but, unfortunately, they were not met.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Was an ok movie to watch the first time, but not something I really need to add to my collection.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Completely ignores the truth - the Canadian Ambassador (my wife attended high school with him) and his wife, and the embassy staff,  put their lives at great risk, and are barely acknowledged.  The cursing, and in particular the F bombs, are totally un-necessary.  NO ONE spoke like that at the time of the crisis, and only Hollywood does it today.<br /><br />There is no need for the swearing, sex and violence that is so prevalent in the movies today!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Saw this movie at the theater and really loved it. Bought a copy to add to my collection. Great special effects!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought this style because I didn't want noise cancelling.  Walking on trails, I wanted to hear people coming up from behind me.  Sound quality is good (not great), but they do the trick.  They are lightweight and comfortable.
0711225176|5.0|Gives a nice overview of Mucha's life and works. If you're a Mucha fan you will like this book. Get it!
B008M721MS|3.0|As an app itself it works ok if you sign up correctly.<br />I have an account with skype for myself that works fine (created a new account), however my husband signed up his own account through his Hotmail (microsoft ID used to create account) and the user ID can not be used for a Skype login on Mobile devices (Kindle or other Android).<br /> I also can not use the KindleHD with my login to connect to my husbands personal Skype account on a PC (w/ MSFT created ID). Typical Microsoft, can not even make their own product work with itself.<br />  IMO Skype shouldn't even allow signing up with a microsoft ID.<br />So if you get this App for mobile, do NOT sign up with a MSFT account ID, it will only serve to annoy you and contacting skype is a waste of time, they could care less.  They just give you the \\"oh, we know answer, too bad, not going to be fixed\\".  You'll just need to create a new ID.<br /><br />If you have a good connection, Video quality is usually pretty good, but Audio quality seems to be sacrificed and you will get choppy audio or it cuts out or is out of sync with the video.<br />For mobile devices, it would be nice to be able to change the Video quality to allow for better steaming (ie lower the Vid quality to reduce buffering or vid/audio lag).<br />Tango has better audio although lower res Video (lower res Video is probably why the audio is better).  It has its issues as well though for the PC and Windows mobile and is not available for Kindle Fire for some reason yet is available for other android devices.
0765325950|5.0|After all these books and rereads, that was a great ending. It sad that its over but had to end sometime. Great book
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I almost always buy Clancy's books, looking for a thriller like we've seen many years before.  They continue to disappoint, as did this one.  I'd like to see a little more exploration of the emotional bonds of an elite team fighting terrorism.  Also, the role that women are given in this drama, as well as in Clancy's other books, is so limited.  Jr respects his mom, and he does a marginal job of taking care of his girlfriend.  His sister is barely mentioned.  I would like to see strong women involved in these thrillers.  Maybe by inserting these ladies, that the men must reckon with, that we could actually see some character development.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Superior quality blu ray - if you have seen it in the cinema, watch it on blu ray and prepare to be amazed.  Only drawback is its lack of substantial special feature materials.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks, made my day. Love the book. Keeps you reading, proved very interesting, and very enjoyable reading.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Good quality blu ray - Entertaining series with great re-watching value - we notice more nuances every time we watch it.  - can't wait for Season 6!!!!

Okay, first find this game in the app store, then if you have a kindle fire<br />It should have a update sign where you usually buy it. And boom! Two new characters!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book could not put it down. I'll be keeping my eye out for the next installment of this series.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|probably the best way to spend a dollar that doesn't involve baby powder. you should buy it. now. addictive is an understatement.

B005LAII8K|4.0|Bruce Willis is one of my favor actors. He did a great job as always. The movie plot was good but did have one hole I found disappointing but its a movie...lol
B0056BU3I2|5.0|stunning and breath taking moments in this movie. if haven't watched this movie then should watch it now. one of the finest movie ever in hollywood times. the sound effects are strong. very smart movie, every moment in this movie is never seen before in any other movies. i keep watching this movie again and again, its favorite!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book of historical fiction. Couldn't put it down! Really enjoyed diving into the time period and learning about life in the antebellum period.
0743270754|5.0|Excellent reading...easy to understand...true to history...I would also recommend as a follow-up reading ULYSSES GRANT..THE MAN WHO SAVED THE UNION IN WAR AND PEACE...both books were terrific and not at all boring.
B005EI86JU|5.0|I've owned SLRs for nearly 50 years, but until now never a DSLR. As film died I was in no position to buy any DSLR, let alone one of the D7000's caliber. When finally I was able to acquire the best camera I've ever used or owned, I needed some help learning about this amazing new technology. So I bought Young's book - a purchase as valuable as any gizmo in my kit beyond the camera itself.<br />Young's chapter about initial setup is alone worth the purchase price. The author explains each setup option, recommends a starting place, and explains it all in language that appeals to the photographer and satisfies the geek in me. But he does it in a way that is plainly realistic and practical enough to be comprehensible to the confused novice that shall always reside within.<br />I bought the Kindle version and this book proves the value of that edition. The setup chapter mentioned above requires flipping from that chapter to later ones, and back. All that is seamless with hyperlinks that work perfectly and a simple bookmark. I experienced none of the frustration such page flipping induces in me with paper texts.<br />I like the content, layout, and Young's writing style. Five stars without hesitation! Buy this book.
B009M8TA20|5.0|What a legend.found all new respect for the man that is zlatan.pity he never had a crack at the premier league
B005PK56TA|5.0|Never even knew this existed, caught one of the current season....then went back to watch earlier shows....interesting concept, great cast, great entertainment
B001RHPJBU|5.0|A truly magnificiant artist. Anyone who is a Phil Collins fan has to have this album. Wonderful memories brought back by his music.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I love all the Daniel Craig Bond movies and this is the best yet. Great action, interesting story line. The opening chase scene is a little over the top, Adeles theme song is not one of my favorites, but other than that, excellent. Craig is really good as usual, Bardem is brilliant. The cinematography in this movie is awesome. Such colors and scenes. I think it should have received a best picture nomination. A must see.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was so amazing, creepy, scary, realistic, and most of all gripping! This book pulled me in and didn't let go until I read the last page. It had me completely stuck. I loved the suspense and the fact that you could expect something important to happen in every chapter. I suggest reading this book on a long weekend, when you will have time to finish it in one setting. It drove me crazy that I had to stop and start several times. Great book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't get how u use it I get Tnt it just wount lite or I cant open the craft table plz help thz
B001BC5HXG|4.0|Everyone knows it is a classic and it is well written. The strong point of this book is its characters, formidably described and that generate great empathy and in some cases horror. But I do think that Steinbeck, for reasons unknown to me, spends some time describing situations in which philosophical and ethical matters are discussed and I found these to be rather moralizing and totally unnecessary.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was superb, start to finish. I am not a 'movie-watcher' but I was drawn in by the historical element of this story. Ben Affleck has truly outdone himself-- the Oscar was well-deserved!! WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book inspired my admiration for such courage. Taking off alone on such a trek is not only courageous but daring. The author is humble and self-effacing when describing her adventures. This is a good book to read if you are fascinated by people taking off &#34;into the wild&#34;
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|sound was bad...I gave it away to goodwill.  I saw Buddy live and he was good.  Just a few weeks later.
0439023491|4.0|I would recommend yes. It's exciting and never boring. A lot of action and catches your interest and attention along the story.

B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I love playing this game. Problems arise when you get so far in the game and turn on your kindle fire to play again and find it has reset to the beginning. Correct that and ill give it 5 stars
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I loved the first part it was the best way to find out more about everything in the world.BUT I don't have to be a good person to know that it is not good to put the word SEX.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I rarely pay extra for kindle downloads since I purchased Kindle Prime so there's always something I'm into thats available to me.  This one, I heard great things about, so I paid the ten bucks and I don't regret it at all.  Wonderfully written, I enjoyed this one more than any book in a long time.  The characters are easy to identify with and I found myself laughing and crying throughout.  I couldn't put it down & it was finished in less than a day.  Highly recommended!  Everyone's got something they'd like to work on in their life & I found a &#34;boost&#34; from this novel, in the aspect that hard work, dedication & loyalty can actually lead to accomplishing life goals. I don't feel the ending really was a good fit but I'd still rate it 5 stars since I found it inspiring.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|I bought this cd as used. But it was practically new.... It's awesome for the price. And album was awesome
B0002XMF5I|5.0|Love this Black Sabbath CD, the delivery was late but that was because of the weather.&#34;Born Again&#34; is a very underrated album forget what the critics say and forget what people say it is a great album ian gillan is amazing on this and of course toni iommi is perfect to. A must Have for Sabbath collectors such as i and gillen fans to.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app.allows me to know exactly how long my kindle fire is going to preform. I never have to wonder what kind of time I have left and what i will or wont be able to do because this app gives me the exact amount of time left for each activity, music, movies, searching the web, even how long I could read before having to plug in again. IT'S FANTASTIC! I always check in with this app before starting an activity, nothing like starting a movie and the battery dies. With this app you never have to go through it again. Also I haven't experienced any excessive drain of power since installing it. I recommend it to avid users.
B00A6KGDDM|5.0|In all probability, most people even vaguely interested in classical music would recognize some of the music of Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847), maybe bits of the Third or Fourth Symphonies or A Midsummer Night's Dream at the very least. Even so, it's doubtful those same folks would recognize much or anything from Mendelssohn's older sister, the composer and conductor Fanny Mendelssohn (1805-1847). The two siblings were soul mates, however, and brother Felix would always let sister Fanny be the first to hear his newest compositions. Now, here's the thing: Fanny wrote over 400 pieces of music herself, although given the times, her family would not allow her to perform them during her lifetime. To help remedy the situation to some small degree, the present album offers two string quartets by the more-famous brother and one by the sister.<br /><br />As I said about the Ebene Quartet the last time I encountered them on disc, they constitute a fine group of performers who exhibit plenty of virtuosity, dash, charm, precision, and poise. The four members of this relatively young, French ensemble are Pierre Colombet, violin; Gabriel Le Magadure, violin; Mathieu Herzog, viola; and Raphael Merlin, cello. They have been playing together for several years now and are becoming quite well known, not only for their playing of classical music but for their performances of jazz, which led some critics to fear the two genres might come into conflict in the ensemble's more-serious interpretations. Apparently, it hasn't happened. Not here, certainly. The Ebene Quartet's playing is as fluid and cultured as any I have heard, and if anything their interest in jazz has only helped hone the spontaneity of their classical skills, which remain smooth, robust, sophisticated, and individualistic..<br /><br />The audio engineers miked things fairly closely, yet there is a good sense of place and space in the recording, with a fine touch of hall resonance and ambience. The quartet members do appear spread out rather widely across the speakers, making them sound somewhat larger than life; still, there is a good clarity about the sonics that more than makes up for any lack of ultimate realism. The violin sound can become a tad forward at times, too; it's never out of character with the distance to the players, however, so it presents no problem. Detailing is always exemplary, and there is a good separation of instruments.<br /><br />John J.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|i got this one to replace my old kindle charger and it works so much better than the original charger that i got with my kindle. i can't go anywhere without my kindle
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|A very fun game. Enough real-time adjustments needed to keep it interesting without making it an exercise in&quot;action&quot;... and it's free.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The graphics are very nice, I like that it has several modes so you can play timed or at leisure. The game works flawlessly on my samsung note 2. My only whine is that the background music, while pleasant, is on a VERY short loop.
0765325950|1.0|The &#34;Memory&#34; of Light was an afterthought crammed into a very few pages at the end of an arduous read, I endured the excessive fluff of 6-10 for the beautiful story, but there was no story here, only a last battle.  I was utterly disappointed, The conclusion is still left to my imaginings based on foreshadowing from earlier books.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I always loved the real game of UNO, but this is just not it. Don't waste your money on this.
080017948X|5.0|Ground Hog day is one of the classic all time films about a person finfing redemption in oneself.  The cast is marvelous and this is as far as I am concerned Bill Murry's best.
B006LSZECO|3.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; was not written well.  Words did not flow evenly.  The author had a wonderful idea but couldn't quite make the characters believable.  Reader can determine early in the book what the outcome will be.  Okay read for a day at the beach.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have been using Razer peripherals ever since they came in to existence as I grew tired of Logitech going downhill in terms of quality. Well the same has happened to Razer in terms of quality and the Synapse software that is malicious malware. I have been using a Death Adder for the last 4 years which I really liked. Then Razer released the Synapse software and the trouble began. Constant mouse hangups and then finding out that the software is in fact malicious did it in. Even after removing the Synapse, my Death Adder still had freezing and hangup's.<br /><br />After all the reviews here I decided to take a chance with the Anker and I am so glad I did. Yes, it is an adjustment from a slim line Adder but it did not take me long to adjust. I have had the mouse about 3 days now and it has worked flawlessly and guess what; no mouse freezes or hangups! I personally don't use all the buttons for my gaming preferences and the fact that once you update and download the Anker software from their site (easy as pie by the way) I was given the option to fully customize even disabling buttons I did not want to use.<br /><br />Furthermore, the DPI is insanely fast. This mouse simply eats up my $80.00 Death Adder for 1/2 the cost. If it dies on me or malfunctions I will promptly comeback and change my star rating and review. However, for now, 5 stars all the way! You simply won't find a better mouse even in the $100.00 + range in my opinion. For me it out performs the Razer, Steel, and Logitech and it's a win/win. Thanks Anker for such an awesome product!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not just about zombies. This examines human interaction after the collapse of society. Personalities are driven to their extreme, mental and physical strength are tested, bad guys arrive and there's a shootout, yikes, there's a zombie, run!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really great game and if you like to play temple run this is like a improved version of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game I just wish it wasn't so expensive to buy the powerups as you got them further upgraded.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|For whatever reason, the movie lost sound in the middle of the movie. This also happened with Prometheus. Very frustrating, I feel sometimes Amazons' system is not compatible with my AT&T service.
B005HSL626|3.0|I loved this game at first but then it started acting funny. it wont open now and even though its great I wish it was better
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game in the world try it its awesome its rome italy who wouldn't love it get it
B000058983|5.0|loved the purchase but don't listen to it anymore, got rid of my turntable but saved the album... maybe i'll see about getting<br /> &#34; Love forever changes &#34; on CD
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Works just as promoted. The case was not what I really wanted but it was an  order error on my part.
B000YJ6736|3.0|Story is very sober, depressing characters and outlook.  Don't bother.  Read some of his other books, like &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34;.  Much more fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game I love it so in my opinion I think everyone needs this game.  please buy this game its free!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This enjoyable game has lots of variety with the costumes the officer has on, to the the prizes you can earn. It is always fun and can be a wonderful way to waste time, or lose track of time, however you want to refer to it. I highly recommend this to all. It's fun for kids too!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Usually I do not rate anything with 5stars,however, this app is an exception. Even if it wasn't free I would still rate it high because it does everything as promised in an easy and interesting format. I really like that I can track the weather in places I will be visiting so that I can get an idea of what clothes to bring. I really like the hourly feature and I find the predictions to be as accurate as humanly possible.<br />  Total thumbs up from me for these reasons and many others.
B0085KGHI6|1.0|one of the discs doesn't play.  It does, however, play in my computer. It is ridiculous to require a certain amount of words.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I really enjoyed this book I hadn't read anything from Grisham in awhile. Hard to put down but I did feel like thst ending was kind of rushed.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|It was good but the others in the series were a little better.  Started out a little tedious to watch but did get better towards the end and did explain more of the overall situation.  I would recommend it but tell people not to expect it to be like the others in the series.  It was good and the acting was good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I love this game. Every time I have my kindle fire I play it. My favorite thing about the game is that it goes to different parts of the world.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Love it - Thanks Amazon for offering great shows!  Easy to download.  If you haven't seen Castle you should give it a try - good show, good characters and interaction,  A little drama sprinkled with humor and of course clue solving - how could you go wrong!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|i was exacting much more then this. there was not enough craziness for me this movie, but hey, the story was good, that's all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is better than the movie. I recommend the book. It is an easy read and a good story.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|first of all this is a move for people that like &#34;investigating noise&#34;, not for the &#34;looker of monsters&#34;.<br /><br />not once was i scared of this movie, or had thoughts running through my mind that made me think of the &#34;whats the monster&#34; which was very sad, because i want to be scared, the only movie that has done that without going the gorier direction, was insidious; that movie had my mind going nuts.<br /><br />insidious beats this movie in all aspects, from monsters to investigating noise, and most of all, the sheer --------------- of it.<br />so if you seen insidious, don't bother with this one, if you do you will not be happy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like the game but it is a bit old for my three year old grand daughter. I help her and she enjoys very much.
B00ARAO720|4.0|very good movie, i enjoyed very much. keep in mind it is a bike movie, so if your a crazy action guy/gal this is not for you. the movie overall was funny, smart, interesting and fun.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it's for kids and daughter enjoys it. But there is no way to quit!!! I hats apps that don't have a proper quit button.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. You get to upgrade it every holiday and it is very fun. It is not bad at all it is perfect for little kids.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|Okay so maybe I'm not the most seasoned Florence fan but this album is AWESOME. Don't get me wrong Lungs is Awesome too. But....<br />in my opinion the only WOW-worthy songs on \\"Lungs\\" are:Dog Days are over,Rabbit Heart(Raise it up),I'm not calling you a liar,Howl,Drumming Song,Cosmic Love,Hurricane Drunk,Blinding.<br />The songs I like on \\"Ceremonials\\":Shake it out,What the water gave me,Never Let Me Go,Lover to Lover,No Light,Seven Devils,Heartlines,Leave my body,Strangeness and Charm,Bedroom Hymns<br /><br />My Ceremonials Track by Track:<br />Only if for a night-Good but too long for being as repetitive as it is.<br />Shake it out-First heard the Katharine McPhee(Smash version) loved it. Then heard the original-thought it was only okay.Heard the recorded live version on a radio station CD-thought it was okay.Heard the original again-loved it.<br />What the Water Gave Me-Love it. Her vocals are haunting and awesome. And I love the myth reference to Atlas in this. Just bathe me in this song.Its so great.<br />Never Let Me Go-Hauntingly beautiful.It makes me feel like crying but at the same time it gives off-that feeling of happiness like what you get at the end of a favorite Disney film.<br />Breaking down-just mediocre in my opinion.<br />Lover to Lover-Brilliant. Only Florence Welsch(Welsch-Welch???Whatever) can make this song, this EPIC.<br />No Light,No Light-A perfect angsty love song-to her fans(that last part I find interesting). Brilliant lyrics.<br />Seven Devils-Another Good one. Biblical references.Flo's vocals.Perfection.<br />Heartlines-Okay,so I admit the lyrics can be a bit morbid if you listen closely but this is one of my favorites.<br />Spectrum-Personally,don't care for this one.<br />All this and Heaven Too-Beautiful but not memorable. In the way some others are.<br />Leave my body-Hot and Steamy.Okay, so its a sex song. But its a good song.Very much unlike those mommy-porn books(I am entitled to my opinions)<br />Remain nameless-Seems kinda pointless.Considering.<br />Strangeness and Charm-Love it.Would really love to be able to hit some of those notes.<br />Bedroom Hymns-Love It.<br />What the water gave me(Demo)-No.Thanks but no. I'm not really one for listening to any demo songs.<br /><br />I'm just gonna do my \\"Lungs\\" track by track while I'm here.<br /><br />Dog Days are over-First heard on the Sing-off.A really great program.While it lasted. Pretty much never skipped on my Ipod.And I willingly admit. I tend to end up dancing to it.<br />Rabbit Heart(Raise it up)-Love it. One of my happy songs.<br />I'm not calling you a liar-I like it.But Its just one of those songs-where I have to be in the mood to listen to it.<br />Howl-Good but it gets tiresome if listened to repetitively.<br />Kiss with a fist-don't care for it.<br />Girl with one eye-don't care for it.<br />Drumming song-Good.like it. Just often skipped because when it gets stuck in my head. Its there for like the next week or so.<br />Between two lungs-don't care for it.<br />Cosmic Love-Initially didn't like it.Liked it for a while. Now I think its just okay.<br />My Boy Builds Coffins-Not really anything special.<br />Hurricane Drunk-Just listened to for the first time yesterday.So far I like it.Just getting used to the lyrics.<br />Blinding-Love it.<br />\\"No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world\\"<br />You've got the love-Don't care for it.<br /><br />Other songs:<br />Heavy in your arms-Not a fave.<br />Breath of life-Love it.<br /><br />Hope this helped someone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So much fun!Almost like having your own horse. I love jumping and caring for AutumnLeaf but she is very picky.
0393317552|5.0|What we try to explain Jared Diamond is why some people (Sumerians, Egyptians, Mayans, etc.) exist as large cities / empire and because other (Australian, African, etc.) could not. Explain why civilization began in the Fertile Crescent and not elsewhere. Explain why we eat the five crops we eat and not almonds, for example. Which animals were first domesticated and why. That and similar things. When I bought the book I did because I was talking about a \\"brief history in the last three thousand years,\\" something that is not at all true. But not for it the book is still very interesting and with very innovative approaches that resulted, at least for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game! Very addicting! I love it! I play it way more than most of my other other games!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is awesome in every way. I'm already at level 96 or something like that, but you can prestige as many times as you want. What funny about it is that Barry's last name is Steakfries. \\"Barry Steakfries\\". It's just another random thing. Also, it took me like20 minutes to write this review since my kindle is messed up.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Looking forward to the next adventure  will. Share both books will my daughters and friends. Love and trust do go hand and hand
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The levels in it are complex and fun. Recommend this to puzzle lovers.It also messes with your brain by certain challenges like not using a certain wheel or an engine. Really fun buy free hd or ad free (I recommend the ad free one because ads are sort of snnoyong in bad piggies)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I like it a lot. I try to make as much money as i can. Lol.
B0091LS07E|1.0|This whole album is about satan starting with \\"THIS girl being on fire!\\"  Her album cover has the pyramids on it and just examine her songs and really listen to the words.  She is not talking about what your first thoughts connect the song hooks with.  Listen to what she does not say and think about what she does say.  These latest crop of 'artists' are nothing more than satanic puppets who get fame and fortune (plus Super Bowl half-time shows) above all others for praising their 'lord.'  This is why you only see and hear the same few (Jay-Z, Gaga, Keys, Beyonce, Ross, Wayne, West, Minaj,Rocky, Hudson, etc...) on the biggest stages.  These people are frauds.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Great writing and acting. Superb art direction. Your somewhat presumptuous review software says I have 13 more words to write, but I don't have 13 more words to say.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are a great option to the earbud and they will not fall out of your ears while you are running on the treadmill!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because it can be fun to play but, while it is possible to play this game without spending money, in my opinion, they set things up in a way that pushes you to spend a little money every now and then to help progress through the game. Then, before you know it, you spend as much as, or perhaps even more than, some of the high end video games designed for a full PC. Frankly the combat aspect of the game is very limited and gets old after a while.<br /><br />Warning: If you have a youngster with their own credit card you will probably want to set some spending limits before they get started.
B00AFEY354|4.0|I'm glad the author was involved in the screenplay and more, but I somehow did not love the movie as much as the book.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I will start by admitting that I am NOT a big fan of 'hidden object' games. The first time I played a 'hidden object' game, after sorting through the first few piles, I started tapping on the screen until I found most of them and then went looking for the last few. Finding 8 objects, or  so, to get one you can use is just not my idea of fun.<br /><br />In this game you do need to find objects but, in general, you need to solve a puzzles to gain access to areas that have the objects. The puzzles are not too hard but a number of them are a bit tricky. As with other point and click games there may be something obvious to pick up and then something not so obvious at the same location so you do need to be careful that you do not miss something or you can get stuck till you find what you missed. If you like solving puzzles you should enjoy this game
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|great game. I have a egg and I'm trying to hunt ducks. :) they will be yummy. just one question. why did they leave on shore with no supplies and the aren't coming back?
B007DIQC90|2.0|I read all of the wondrous reviews of this CD and couldn't wait to hear it. Suffice it to say that I was underwhelmed. To my ears, it's just some relatively low end, vapid pop-- not much more. Despite many reviews stating that the tracks were wonderfully varied, to me there's a sameness to most of it, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Though I have found some nice musical nuggets by paying attention to reviews of those who (seem to) enjoy much of the same music I do, I'm coming rapidly to the conclusion that the 'wisdom of the crowd' is overrated when it comes to something as personal and eclectic as musical taste... sorry-- really wanted to like this music, very disappointed. YMMV.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Great movies came on time was a gift for a friend of mine on Christmas he is a big Clint Eastwood fan.<br />Thanks.<br />Mark....
B000274THQ|5.0|If you want a movie about East Germany, select Lives of Others.  This movie is about a son's love for his mother, about his good friend the film maker, and about all the just regular people in his life all trying to make life work pre- and post-Wall.  Just a wonderful heart warming story.  Yeah, mom was a Commie, but even she knew that what she thought she loved about it wasn't real.  But that's a side bit.  Wonderfully funny too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the best book ever. People who like action should read this book as soon as possible. It`s Amazing
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Since I read the book before seeing the movie, I was skeptical.  However, this movie, while not perfect, kept my attention and delighted me.  Tom Hardy's character did not not have much to work with in the way of the script, but his character is a man of few words who does more with his actions and mannerisms.  Hardy did a good job with his character, creating a facade of invulnerability and toughness with a soft spot for his family and friends.  Shia LaBeouf, whose previous work I have not been a fan of, was actually rather good as the junior Bondurant who is eager to prove himself, but is callow and unsure of himself.  In my view, Guy Pearce, as the foppish, preening, self-absorbed, inhumane deputy from Chicago stole the film.  You really hated him and when Pearce was on the screen, you noticed little else.  Pearce was in the movie Prometheus, and was, in my view, the weak link in that film from an acting perspective, but in this film he really brought his character to life.<br /><br />From what I can gather about Prohibition and the history of it, \\"The Wettest Country in the World\\" is more than a little over the top, and this movie is also over the top.  However, sometimes the Moonshiners did resort to violence and there were lawmen who were corrupt and on the take.  Therefore, this movie is almost certainly a composite of the worst elements of the Prohibition Era, and it is a well-told story that is engaging the interesting.<br /><br />There is some violence and nudity.  Sensitive and younger viewers should be warned.  However it is not over the top.  All-in-all, a worthy investment for a Friday night.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is very good but when I tried up dating it to get to the sub way surfers Rome it did not work and I am very frustrated at this game right now
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had a Downton Abbey Marathon last weekend and loved every minute of it.  Can't wait for the next season.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game ! It's so addictive!I'm telling you you can play this all day without putting it down. But the thing is, it freezes up every once and a while, but overall it's great!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great book, and this isn't a review, it is a rating, and I don't have anymore to say.

1449410243|4.0|I was able to read this in about 30 minutes.  Some of it is so hilarious that I luaghed out loud and shared with others.  The comic section in the middle regarding the two office cats seems to drag and I found myself skimming over it instead of reading.  Worth the money if you are going to share around with others.  Cat and dog lovers will appreciate this book.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Never watched this show until I found the re-runs on TNT.  It is a GREAT show--well written and the actors are superb. I have found DVDs of the first four seasons and was excited to find the Season 5 from<br />Amazon.  Hope ABC keeps it around for a sixth season now that Castle and Beckett are getting comfortable<br />in their relationship.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|I found the book unusual,but interesting but it did not grip me entirely.Not as intriguing as some of his other books.<br />I would however definitely recommend it .
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a very enjoyable series with strong, interesting characters, male and female.  It's a refreshing change from most of the current TV shows and I  highly recommend it. I
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I'm surprised at the quality of the acting by the little Brandon Waters, and the poingancy of the story.  Nicole Kidman was great as an British Lady.  First tiem I've seen Hugh Jackman....very good, believable character.<br />The bad guy got his due, and the ending was good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very good for someone with poor eyesight. Nice large screen. Easy to read and shows calculations as you type along.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book was a gift for my husband.<br />He is loving the book!  The plot lines are closely related to current events.<br />He usually likes books about war and politics - this is a perfect fit!
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was made outside the big budgets of holiday.  But it captures the universe of Dredd phenomenally.  This isn't a parody of a gritty and brutal world.  This is a gutsy rendering of a dark city where the police can only respond to about 6% of the violent or worse crimes.  The satire and irony of the original stories are there creating a perfect blend of humor against the cruel backdrop.  I've seen this about 30 times now and I am still impressed with how the favored the original material.  Unlike the farce version made in the 90's.  In 3-D this movie shines as well.  I haven't seen a better film that truly demos what your 3-D TV can do than this one.  Yet the whole movie isn't overly saturated with &#34;eye-popping&#34; 3-D moments.  When they step into a scene that really screams &#34;this should be in 3-D&#34; they execute flawlessly.  And when a normal cinematic perspective is more than adequate they don't choke you with in/out 3-D focusing of needless objects just because they could.  Add the fact, that you get 3 copies of the movie in one package just makes the deal sweeter.  -Hope this helps-

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a really awesome game. It may seam simple at first but it gets increasingly harder and more addicting. Travling around from city to city adds even more excitement.
B006BQM762|4.0|A cross between Spielberg's &#34;E.T&#34;. and M. Night Shyamalan's &#34;Signs&#34;.  Not at all what i was expecting... not sure how i missed the previews for this.  Good film.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Cover is nice quality and stand works well.  I think it'll hold up for quite some time.  My mother bought the upgraded case and it's very nice too.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|My favorite TV show and it looks like it was filmed yesterday.  I'll never regret this purchase and will buy the other seasons as well.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Compelling and painful for those who watched what little story we got via media back then. Grateful to know what really transpired for those escapees. NOT nearly enough recognition for the part the Candians played in the success of the outcome. Embarassing omission on Affleck's part.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is a great game I love the fact that you get to draw your charecter and get to be involved with your game. I also love the fact that it help with your problem solving skills.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game. interesting but creepy storyline. enjoyed it. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
B000QRIGLC|5.0|May God bless PO1 Luttrell and his fallen Brothers. For their sacrifices should never be I<br />In vein. HOOYAH SVDT-1 and SVDT-2!!!!!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I can't believe how good they sound.  Way better than any other band from their era.  I definitely recommend it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|OMG!!!! BEST APP EVER!!! this app is wayyyy better than the one on the Pc. now I could play btd5 anytime anywhere!!! no mod Internet connection for this guy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Just like temple run the changes the boards the ni evil monkeys this game is practically better than temple run
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Extremely well done film and so easy to let yourself go and get caught up in the fantasy.  Definitely worth having your own copy.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|I play this at work and it puts everyone in a dancing mood. This is a very well produced album.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|What's not to love about this season unless you are not a fan.  Critically underrated despite it being incredibly well done and entertaining.  All fans should have their own copy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great free calculator app. Works well,  easy buttons. I'fe junker my old calculator w/the sticky buttons &amp; just use this.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it told me a lot about myself and people I know. It was the first book on this subject I have read and I found it gave me confidence to be who I am rather than what people want me to be.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|she is like a tall, cool drink on a very hot day, I am especially hooked on the song&#34;Next to Me&#34;.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I bought this for my two year old daughter as a Valentine's Day gift and she LOVES it! It is now her favorite movie.  She asks to watch it almost every day before bed.  I am so glad I invested in it, the price was also great!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Movie deserved Best movie in 2013 Oscars.<br />It was very much worth the money<br />Sound quality is perfect and can't be outdone.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Good plot. Great adventure. Sometimes plots dont make sense in terms of lack of securities, like they just kept losing their hand guns to the enemies or when enemies could access ship transporter to beam themselves to the bridge.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I haven't played all the modes, but adventure mode is fun, but makes you think and plan.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I gave it a five cause it was interesting, fun, and adventurous. It was really an awesome book and I can't wait for the next book! You have to try it. This is my second time reading it and it never gets old.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a fun game for pony lovers but there aren't much games to play with the ponies. It is also confusing to invite friends. But still I love the ponies! Great buildings too! This is a great game for pony lovers like me.
0307951529|5.0|My girlfriend loved it. She is very interested in starting her own business and could not stop talking about this book for weeks.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|One of the best book as I've read.  I can't wait to see what's next always a good read when you have time
6305428352|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over.  Great one to have in our home collection.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It's kind of like LOST only with more blood and guts than most action movies. I just can't stop watching it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Hearing friends and family rave on this series prompted me to purchase this.  My family & I are hooked and have seen all now thru Season 3, and can't wait for Season 4 to begin.
1616550414|5.0|If you are an avid Zelda nerd like my boyfriend and I have become then this book needs to be in your library! Gorgeous from cover to cover and fills in all the gaps and questions you could possibly have with the story.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This book had all I wanted of intrigue, suspense and humor.  John Corey has an edge to his humor that makes the book worth reading.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can not wait for the next chapter in this amazing series! The Percy Jackson books had me hooked and giggling the whole way, the Hero series has had me laughing and crying within a single chapter.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a really fun game. Tell everybody about this game. And I mean everybody.<br /><br />Sorry, but Rosecafe the reviewer, has to go and write other reviews.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|If you have a gamer in your life like enjoys games like Final Fantasy 9, Journey, or even Zelda, then these games need to be in their collection! Best price too, even compared to Game Stop and Play Station Network.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another excellent Jack Ryan novel by Tom Clancy.  I recommend the entire series to anyone interested in action packed novels.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Can't wait to read the final book! I am hoping for a not-so-tragic ending for Lena and Alex. This is a great YA series
1609611543|5.0|One of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading regarding our current health crisis. Kudos to Dr. Davis for educating us........this book will hopefully change the world. It certainly changed mine!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|At first I was hesitant to read the book because I wasn't sure the storyline appealed to me. I was immediately drawn into the characters and their stories. Ultimately, I couldn't wait to finish but didn't want to it to end! This is always the sign of a great book to me.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|As usual Bruce Willis does a great job. The plot in this one seems a bit complecated at first but doesn steal from the enjoyment.I reccomend this movie ... nice job !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Bought the Kindle fire for Christmas gift.. she been getting books & Games like crazy.. thanks for the great service..
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I read this as a part of a book club. I had no expectations, but found it was easy to climb into the story. The writing is smooth and the development of characters is substantial. Unlike other books, I never felt the need to skip excessive description or dialogue because it dragged. I did feel like I had read it before because there were similarities to other books (The Help?) but I could not put my finger on anything in particular.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a historical fictional story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderfully written series with excellent character development. You get really drawn into their world. There are just so many good things to say about it. I watched the series with my 12-year-old daughters and we all were hooked on it throughout. We are very much looking forward to season 4 and beyond!
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|A gentleman with a great musical touch. The visuals are steady and give moments of concentration as well as fingering. But mainly the music is good!
B003G93ZCM|5.0|A nicely written story of Gene's life from when it counts for the reader, when he was flying and then at NASA. Not a long winded dull discussion that often pervades American biographies about their religion and what school they attended!<br />A 10 for me
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Sold from page one. Caitlin Moran is a literary genius who can bait you with humor and reel you in with a wisdom only a real woman could have.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I really enjoy this game but only giving it 3 stars because it doesn't have all the updates yet. :(
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used AVG since version 7.  Always the public domain, or free, version on all my PCs at home with exceptional results.  Many times recommended to friends and co-workers and now I have used this app for 1 month with again, exceptional results.  Love the Widget - KillAllApps is my favorite.  Excellent transition from PC to Android so far.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. Clear pictures. No freezing. And I can upload my own pins! Highly recommended
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show - wish I had taken more time to watch it because now I have to wait for the next Series.
B00846F1YW|4.0|It was fun. It was a fast game. Very easy but I still liked it. Would download more like it.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|Cool idea but these developers did not design this game with average players in mind.  So frustrating that you will try it once and uninstall it
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Of course it's fun. It's angry birds. And it's ad free so they aren't in the way of the game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book.  It was a fast read and one that I couldn't put down.  It had so many twists and turns and really kept you guessing even all the way to the end.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It repeats the same rooms which would be fine if they didn't give you only a few things to find. And each room takes energy. Energy that you only have so much of. And sometimes the amount of energy a room requires is ridiculous.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|Disappointed. Dull. Total lack of humor.  Did not see much from this series in the way of entertainment.  There was no way for these characters to hold the attention of an audience for very long.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|There's no depth to this story but it was fine to mindlessly relax and forget the day's problems. Would rather see Natalie's butt than Ashton's!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I was consumed by this book, The Fall of Giants.  It was like reading a long history lesson, except more interesting.  The only  small complaint I have is that there is limited character development with some of the more significant characters in the book.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son for his PS3 and I now use the product. I love it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|My Kindle won't sign on via Facebook to play this game - it is NO fun to play as only a guest.
0345529057|1.0|Martin should have written porn. He has good plot, but so interlaced with violence and porn that it is ruined. I do not recommend these books, and I especially warn off Tolkien fans. There is no satisfaction or redemption to this series due to Martin's obsession with trying to find creepier levels of disgust and shock ALL THE TIME.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I loved this film when i was growing up. the transfer to BD seams good. i also enjoyed the restored ending
B0054SMID0|4.0|this was a surprising movie!  I love Matthew M. so I thought it might be good but the story was surprising.  I was interested throughout the movie and kinda thought I knew what would happen next and then bam...I even yelled a few times at the screen so it would go my way.  He played it good and if lawyers are really that slippery then have Mercy on the judicial system.  Oh yeah, Trace Adkins as a biker!  He played that well too!  Don't know why this comes up as husbands name on my profile...he does not love Matthew M.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Very happy with this purchase.  I love the movie and the music.  Anyone who likes Beatles music should like this.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|Well, well, well...<br />I've been listening to Green Day since 1995. I loved all their albums, not much the 21st Century.<br />This new album ( a triple one ) is nothing special and it's definitely their worst release.<br />It's nothing but a collection of songs, so poppy, so simple, nothing spectacular.<br />I can't listen to the whole thing, is way to long, i can't play 3 CDS one after the other, but i did listen to them in like a week. Not impressed.<br />Is just way to simple, i think. It's missing creativity.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|If Hell or Purgatory had a waiting room, this is what would be playing.  Trip-hop like beats to the spookies.  It's what would happen if Die Form were crossed with Terminator-X from Public Enemy.  If the cenobytes from Hellraiser had a social club, CRYSTAL CASTLES would be the house band.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show continues to get better and better with season 2! The plot thickens and leaves you eagerly awaiting the start of season 3! :)
B00946WM6Q|1.0|I love the movie.  There were many times I was dissapointed by the quality of the picture during playback, and was sure my Amazon downloand wasn't actually a true HD picture.  I regret spending the extra money on the HD, and I feel like I should have bought the DVD instead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because I'm like addicted to action and this game has a lot of it so yea i love this game i liked Italy but i love Rome more
B00946WMXY|1.0|I love the movie.  There were many times I was dissapointed by the quality of the picture during playback, and was sure my Amazon downloand wasn't actually a true HD picture.  I regret spending the extra money on the HD, and I feel like I should have bought the DVD instead.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Probably a good movie, but just not my cup of tea guess I'm getting too old and conservative these days..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|cant believe its even better than the first one, but they did it. much more challenging which i enjoy. cant wait to see what they'll come up with for number 3!
B0067QPVD2|4.0|The 2011 prequel The Thing is, essentially, a shot by shot remake of John Carpenter's 1982 The Thing ... BUT ... it is a very good shot by shot remake.  What this updated look at the world of the 1982 JC movie does is reverse engineer all the terrible-ness Kurt Russell and company discovered in the Norwegian science camp and fill in all the shape-shifting bloody blanks.  And this movie does a really good job of that.  Filling in for Kurt Russell this time around is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate, a paleontologist invited to the arctic to helped a group of (doomed) scientists explore a thing they've found in the ice.  From there, it's \\"Who Goes There\\" chills and suspense.  It would be easy to merely compare this movie to John Carpenter's and find it lacking.  In '82, John Carpenter's nightmare vision was fresh and awful and groundbreaking.  But this new Thing offers its own horror movie pleasures -- a chance to see what happened to the Norwegian camp ... some mechanical effects that are as good as those provided by Rob Bottin in ,82 ... and a first-rate performance by Winstead as the heroine of the piece.  All too often, horror movies rely on the idiotic to propel the plot.  That can't be said of this movie.  Everyone does what we would all probably do, and yet ... well, it's the thing, after all.  This is a fun movie experience created with obvious respect and care for what has come before it.  And don't forget to stay through the credits to see how this film bumps up right against John Carpenter's movie.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|It's not a walk in the park.  Some of the levels require you to do it a few times to figure out a solid strategy to beat the computer.  I wish there were more levels!<br /><br />-1 star for game freezing often.
0062014102|1.0|Beware: this book showed up as 'recommended' when viewing real science books (think I saw it on the Black Hole Wars from Susskind). The Holographic principle is the newest development in physics and I wanted to read more about it. This is the just paranormal stupidity. DO NOT BUY, National Enquirer is cheaper
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|i didnt think it was awesome but it was ok id recommend it more to boys that other girls. But it was ok
0671722905|4.0|i really like this book because of william shakespeare. it is a very interesting book and it shipped really fast
B00BESLHEA|1.0|This movie is a waste of time. There are some good names in the film but I don't know whether to think it a horrible comedy or a horrible action movie.  The scenes don't flow smoothly and the whole thing just makes you feel awkward.  Try something else.  Anything else.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is in the house! I LOVE this game!!! This game is realy awesome. It is way better than the first temple run!
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Young hero overplays farcical role. Old people are sickeningly sweet. Overall everybody is a character actor trying to get attention. Yuck.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|My son has her CD and I listened to it when visiting and loved her voice.  I only like 3 to 4 songs on it, but everytime I listen to it I do like it better.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|This Christmas CD is wonderful. It is classic Rod Stewart. His voice hasn't changed and I love the fact that he can perform well in the rock and roll genre and the classics genre. I really liked this CD.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|After seeing the motion picture, listening to my CD of the movie and the DVD of the original cast, I had to purchase this 25th anniversary version. A bonus feature of this DVD is that it includes the original cast joining the 25th anniversary cast to double my pleasure of the music and singing. Another collector's item for me!!
B001EYK52O|1.0|I as a faithful Steve Mc Queen fan, always wanted to see this movie, it was a DOG... and I do NOT recommend it at all !!
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great scenery, real actors...they just don't make them like this any more!<br />I would suggest this for Teenagers on up!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|NO wonder this did not win more at the Oscars, it was pretty bad indeed, the acting by Phillip Seymoor Hoffman was of course Outstanding as always, with what he was given, but overall a DOG !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this game was awesome and I'm really glad I got it.I give it a five star rating for this game.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|The app has a good theory, but its just too fast and unforgiving.<br /><br />I'm 25 and quite a gamer, and i repeatedly failed the first 20 second course for 20 minutes. Challenge is good, but this is crazy.  The angles are poorly done and hard to see, making all the maps feel nearly impossible.<br /><br />I would not recommend this.
B0006GWPXI|5.0|I love this vehicle. It is very detailed and worth the money! I still didn't find the best place to display it in my office. Mint condition...
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I ordered this the same day I did my camera - a Canon 7D. I shoot alot of basketball, and having the shutter release and other controls available in the traditional spot while holding the camera in vertical (portrait) mode is very valuable to me. The extra batter life is helpful. It has an extra mounting point for a handstrap, which is useful, and I have adapted a handstrap for use in portrait mode. A couple of cautions: 1) this grip is fairly wide at the base, as the batteries go in horizontally. This is no issue for me, in fact I appreciate having something to get a hold of. If you have small hands, this might be difficult or uncomfortable for you. 2), with the grip, the 7d is a beefy camera, and quite a handful. Again, not so much of an issue for m. It tends to balance out long lenses. You might not like it. Great quality. Been using this heavily for 18 months and still going strong.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Slow start especially the first chapter with pages of botanical information but by page 50 you start to see some character development.  Editing on the Swedish to English translation is sloppy and I was surprised to see such an unprofessional job done by a major publisher.  All in all, a suspenseful novel that holds your attention. Will look forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy putting puzzles together so this is a treat. I just spend to much to much time on it.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|Not much substance. Mostly pop science and 'you can do it' encouragement. Was hoping for something more solid and perhaps some more solid advice. There were a couple interesting ideas such as introversion in different cultures, but they weren't developed either. It was mostly a feel-good book for introverts.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a lovely movie for not only the little ones , but adults as well.  Great quality, as expected.  Humor and drama, a good mix.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|I like all of his work. This one, particularly, gives you a glimpse of Swedish political history that is quite interesting
B008VBYN80|4.0|so far so good! I have had the game in the past and had a lot of trouble. The problems have been fixed and I am a very happy camper.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|although I rated it 5 stars, I noticed there's a copy company. I'm only 10 so Im not possitiive  but im pretty sure that the other company coppied this
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so fun i love it great wi fi to connect with so i love it with all my heart
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works well but I would like to see at least one additional feature in the mobile version that the desktop version has - the ability to read more complex PDF files.  I have one utility that captures writing digitally along with audio that can be exported as a PDF file that plays back like a movie and allows one to junp about without having to watch and listen sequentially.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a fun activity for any level of drawing skill. It is easy to use with a great variety of colors and textures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is lovely,fun,and magnificent. So happy I downloaded it.wish they could do more versions of this. I recommend this game
B007B6T3K4|4.0|I always liked Xandria with Lisa Middelhauve as their singer, but new vocalist Manuela Kraller takes them in a new direction.  There's really only one thing to say: they now sound more like Nightwish than Nightwish does.  I'm speaking of classic Tarja-era Nightwish, of course.  If you like Tarja and the operatic approach to symphonic metal vocals, you'll love this.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I thought this was gonna be a joke! VEVO has tons of excellent music videos and concert footage! I am extremely impressed!!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This was the best show I have ever seen in quiet sometime. After you see one episode you are hooked<br />and you can watch the whole series at once; commercial free!! Yey... Kevin Spacey & Robin Wright who<br />I both adore shine tremendously.. I highly recommend this to anyone. I hate to think Congress is like<br /> this but I am afraid it could be from actual facts, I wonder..Thank-you Netflix for putting something<br /> great and keep them coming.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I got so many ideas for the home, money saving tips, and more recipes for healthy eating I could ever imagine!
B000FC2ROU|4.0|Have been a huge Murakami fan since his Windup Bird.  His distinctive blend of romance and the surreal is addictive.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Anytime I need to kill 5 minutes, I open this puzzler and see if I can beat my last time... The controls are awesome. Having to scroll the cube to find matches is very fun. Such a simple concept but always entertaining....
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Excellent cinematography and acting. The best Christmas movie that you've probably never seen. Awesome actors that you've probably never heard of.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all the books twice...Now I can not wait for Christian's to tell his side of the story, please hurry. Lol HURRY.
1451648537|5.0|What more can I say? This is one of the best books I've read recently. I just can't wait to recommend this to others.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|it a fun movie to watch. it copy cat Hong Kong cinema with fancy flying move.  It not as good as a real Hong Kong kung fu action movie because some of the high flying move are kinda off but still pretty good for an American made movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is grate for people of all ages. It is similar to temple run but on a subway. It also updates every month or so to a new location. in February it was Rio, now ot is Rome
B00BHMETKC|1.0|CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE WON THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. MUST BE ALL POLITICS. I WAS TOTALLY BORED WITH IT.WISH THAT AMAZON WOULD GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY SPENT.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series always keeps you at the edge of your seat, the only real downside is the constant loss of characters. Otherwise its interesting story lines, has good plot twists and develops characters well over multiple episodes.<br /><br />If you cannot use your imagination to see such an apocalyptic scenario the show may seem immature, but if you can its a great 45 minutes of entertainment.
B007QS5K0E|5.0|in anticipation of tales of xillia hitting the US soon  i bought this one hell of a figure .<br /><br />i must say everything about it is fabulous from the box packaging  to the finished product<br /><br />as for the figure it self its really amazing in every angle possible ( specially the hair  )<br /><br />the coloring feels as its 100% true to Milla's look from the game<br /><br />the stance is very nice with the added sword she looks more elegant<br /><br />& of course her hair is really the best part i liked about the figure ( Soo FLUFFY !!! )<br /><br />easly one of my most beloved figures i ever had & it was totally worth it
B004EBT5CU|2.0|The inside of the cd case  was broke so the the cd won't stay put inside the case. Not happy about that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has more layers than a cake. Every one has his own story and the cast together is a symphony of drama.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This album caught my eye on Amazon due to the shear quantity of 5 star reviews.  Usually there are enough haters to bring any album down to a 4 star overall.<br /><br />The album is great to listen to from start to finish because each song leaves you in the perfect place to pickup the next song.  Kinda reminds me of how Neutral Milk Hotel \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" is... each track is better because of the songs accompanying it, but individually none of the songs are a chart toppers.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Just make sure you play it when your mind is fresh!  hit like tiles to get rid of them, then turn the cube as you go to find other matches. Try to beat your best time. Lots of fun!
0345803507|3.0|This one started out good but I have not gotten half way through the book.  I can give betteer review after I finish reading it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it!  The picture was very clear and of course the story was incredible.  I couldn't stap watching it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love Susan Boyle.  She does not come out new more CDs fast enough for  me.  If she recorded a new one every other month I would buy them
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Loved it! Buying next book now. Love the slight difference from the amc tv show. Can't wait to see where it leads next
0345803493|5.0|This book was much better thatn thefirst.  Couldn't put it down.  It seemed more like a love story,morelove, less sex.  Well, less kinky sex.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|I have read all books of Preston Child, i love  their writing because it's so real and well researched, and it's keeping you always on the edge.never boring,.never vulgar! I think this one is the best one, and strongly hope there  will be soon another adventure of the faboulous Pendergast agent!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Much better than I was expecting. Watched it twice in a row. Recommended to anyone who likes hardcore action movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can not get my eyes off. the screen its so awesome. I have. it on the computer. so if u read this winter of 2013 new multiplayer world on computer nion
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An excellent series that exemplifies the stedfastness of so many young people that we tend to lose sight of today due to the media reports we here.  I read all three books within a two week period and found it to be spellbounding and full of surprises.  Very tastefully written due to the content.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I went into this with low expectations outside of the tracks i was already familiar with and was blown away by how solid this album is. Once you get past the mega-hits you still have a ton of great songs to listen to.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I ordered this on line by its picture and description from among other choices.  I am extremely happy with it.  While I have nothing to personally compare with it, I doubt I'd find one I like more.  It totally meets my greatest expectations.  In my opinion, it cannot be improved much, if any.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Passion Pit's follow-up expands on the sounds of Manner's but improves on it in nearly every aspect. It might be lacking a huge track like &#34;Sleepy-Head&#34; but overall the album is a great listen, solid from top to bottom.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The main character tells his story in the graphic present which helps make this  story of a mentally ill person a very dramatic narrative.  All the characters are well conceived, and the author cleverly provides the reader with the necessary data so references to football can be understood even by readers who are not avid NFL fans.  I was surprised by how much I liked this book. By Diana K. Dunlop
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The Doctor's light-hearted approach to things makes this show absolutely marvelous. It is lower budget, but the show keeps your attention well enough that you don't really notice.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Despite Amazon saying this game will work on my Archos 43 tablet, it doesn't.  After launching the app, all I get is a black screen.  Each time I give it several minutes to load/open/start (whatever), but nothing changes.
1616550414|5.0|Great book, I love the original art and I like this amazing edition, thanks Nintendo. Greate price, very hight recomended

B007QDNKQA|5.0|The movie was intense and well thought out. Never let you go from the start! All the action seemed real and made sense. Couldn't tear myself away!
B0095P29EG|4.0|Not the Best of the Super Hero Series but fun to watch anyway. Special effects were good & character interaction was fun.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|It's a fun game where you have to make sure that your ball doesn't fall down to the universe. It's quite hard to hold the ball on the course, but it will get better once you get used to it. It has 3 different levels: explorer, chalenger, conqueror. I think it's good for all ages, it's not very hard to play and even kids can make it. Also, it has different soundtracks which makes it a bit better.<br />The quality and graphics are good and it works fine on my Nexus 7. In my opinion it's worth downloading as a free app of the day.
0300169787|5.0|Very satisfied with the book itself - it surpasses my expectations in the quality of photos and the information about Alexander McQueen.  I am also impressed by the speed in which the book arrived and the overall cost - which was lower than i expected.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It drug me in and I couldn't stop reading. The ending leaves you hanging wanting and needing to know more.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I normally don't watch things like this.  But this draws you in.  you can't wait to see the next episode.
1476712042|5.0|what more is there to say this book is amazing i have it on ebook and now i have the book i love travies
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I enjoyed the flexibility of delivery with this particular bundle.  As for the movie - it was great!  It was a look at the State run amok in the not too distant future, with leaders and a ruling-class population lacking in empathy and focused on entertainment and the finer things in life (sound familiar?).  The story goes to the heart of the fundamental desire for survival, love, and liberty with the portrayal of a young, evolving, female rebel (Katniss Everdeen) who is challenging the State in the only way she knows how.  Moving and revealing!
B0083H6AQA|5.0|robert pattinson was great in this movie i lve when he plays parts like this its really good to see him break away from the whole twilight thing as for the movie 5 thumbs up i loved it
B008IBPMZG|4.0|I love this series. It provides a fascinating look into the world of the social and working classes during a time of great change in the world. Wonderful actors, beautiful costumes, amazing scenes in a real house whose history helps to inpire the show!
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|fan rob alert this really hurt and supprised me i couldnt believe that such an amazing actor stared in such a bad movie who told him to do this movie it was really bad a lot of bad sex and lanuge
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Very good read.  Just got hooked on on D.D.  Warren recently.Thank you Lisa, I love a good book with a good story without all the sex thrown in. So many books now that throw sex in and it takes away from the story
0425263908|5.0|this book is almost better then fifty shades of grey i love this book the story is amzing and the main charters are more devoeleped
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am in love with this series it is all I wanted and more! I want more even as I am reading the last word. Buy it it is worth it.
0425263916|5.0|i thought that fifty shades was the only book i was ever going to read until someone told me about the crossfire series i love both books but this one has none stop action
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is a very convenient when your not by a television or dont have time to wait for local on the eights
B005IQZB14|5.0|A book you think about all the time and not sure..like the trail you want it to end.  I enjoyed every minute!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very fun, but if you play it to much it won't be fun anymore. It gets kind of repetitive after playing a few games.Kind of like Temple Run.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Such a great game, graphics are really good. Now at level 60, not collecting anymore money or stars, unable to get animals as all that left are ones you have to purchase with peanuts. Refusing to buy as this could become expensive. Waiting to see if game will be updated. Overall a good game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome it is a time killer. I really request anyone who plays games like this to play it
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It alright I like that it is like playing angry birds the courses are fun I would recordmend it to my friends
B007H1HQW0|5.0|First time using the g2g  was great. The cut was prefect. Than I did 8 bottles, only four came out. Was batting 500. I feel the problem wasthe operater, the ice water started to melt, and did not have that cold temp to shock the hot bottle. Now I have about  20 to 30 bottles to cut. Over all very happy with it, and empting the wine bottles is fun.
B002NXOQF2|1.0|This was a book club selection for the group I belong to.  After reading it, no one would even admit it had been their choice.  14 of us and none of us liked it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I can play it All day.it's like temple run almost. I would recommend this game to any one.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Classic Andrea Bocelli.  I've never been disappointed and this one was no different.  The voice and emotion never cease to thrill me.  It's a must-have for Bocelli fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really fun game! And I love how there is so many updates all the time. I play it everyday!
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this CD.  Seems like Groban has sold out and is trying to go main-stream.  He needs to go back to his roots.  I probably won't buy Groban again.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Rankin in good form as John Rebus pushes aside all diversions and defeats to identify the culprit(s). Dialog is tone perfect, and Scottish descriptions of Edinburgh and points north are remarkable. The book stays with you after reading, a sign of an author on his game.
B007YLEMDE|4.0|These aren't the classics, obviously, but a must-have for any Stevie Ray Vaughan fan. SO cool to hear him perform with so many great artists, especially to cover Going Down. That and Oreo Cookie Blues alone make this album worth the purchase.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Peter Jackson again does a wonderful job bringing us back to Middle Earth. Great acting, costuming and writing. But thiry to forty-five minutes could have been left on the cutting room floor. The interminable chase scenes with the goblins both underground and later above ground could have been cut in half. Even the troll scene early in the movie was a bit long. I still think it is worth buying the DVD knowing you can fast forward through these parts.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The twists and turns kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Fantastic plot which will keep you up to find out all of the mystery built into this book. The storytelling style reminds one of books by Umberto Eco or Victor Hugo.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game  go for income first you will need the money then go for troop build  keep an eye on energy use also
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this second book much more than the first!  More emotion and more of a love story with mysterious twists and turns.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|Not a bad idea for a game but I find controlling the ball the issue. The main problem I see is that you are always trying to catch up with the ball. The controls don't seem to be the problem but rather it appears related to a performance issue. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire HD and I notice how slow the game feels. I don't sense any fluidity in how the ball moves.
B00607EWYC|5.0|I felt as though I was on a journey through the mind of 2 mystical minded men who were aware of thinking about the world and their place and purpose in it. One an epileptic in a loveless marriage the other his son . they each in his own way proceed through their lives building, observing patiently.
0316044695|5.0|What else can you say about a true act of heroism and patriotism? This book is a must read for every red blooded American. Once you start reading it, you will not be able to put it down.
0984999302|5.0|Got this for my husband. He says it a good book and a easy read. He also says it full of good information. That's all I could get him to say about it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|almost like the x-files, however this show does it own thing. I love Walter, he is perhaps one of the main reasons I watch.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|Wow, I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in some time. I knew nothing about this movie before watching it, but I was attracted by the rating and all of the top-notch actors (Bryan Cranston, John Goodman, etc) whom I have enjoyed in other things. This movie was predictable and poorly written. Zero character development; what was provided in the way of rounding out even the main roles was SO ham-handed. I remember being bored and disgusted when Affleck gets one of the hostages to trust him simply by telling him his real name, and that he has a wife and son. Really? We are supposed to believe that this is all it takes to solve that problem? I know time was limited but c'mon. BO-ring! The chase scene at the end is supposed to be epic but by that point I was just glad the movie was ending. I am so tired of Hollywood bulls***, using the same tired techniques to manipulate our emotions. There was nothing fresh or surprising about this movie. Don't waste your time.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this for my husband.  He wanted something that had alot of pockets and was durable.  He is happy with the product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is perfect for horse lover's. The graphics look so real and amazing! I love this game. I recommend it for animal lover's.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is a great movie with great 3D. I love it. It is action packed and I feel that I get what I am paying for. I don't understand why it's gotten such bad reviews. I hope they make a sequel.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A wonderful, honest novel about everyday people, dealing with everyday issues. Very relatable/lovable characters, and a great story. The movie was great too! Love the story in general.
1878424505|5.0|This is probably the only self help book anyone would need. The 4 principles are simple and clearly explained in this short read, with no effort required other than to practice them in your daily life.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Lets keep it short and simple. Its a great, movie not so much on CGI, like most, and close to the plot, for the book, not too off-skewed, and ruining the book like Percy Jackson series. Great movie, and makes you want to just, jump...off.. into the abyss and find Four and Six <3 It's like my soul...was..unbound....<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />I Am Number Four.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon's love for Eva was so strong you felt it in his words. Great read. You easily get caught up.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I find the game a challenge.. it takes good timing and coordination to get thru the levels. my one complaint I having to start all over each time you lose all your lives. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Mario fan.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book helped me understand addiction and forgive one who passed. It brought on a lot of strong emotions and explained things that I didn't notice or know because I had never dealt with someone addicted to opiates. I always idolized Motley Crue and my first concert was Theatre of Pain in Fresno, California. I used to have all their pictures plastered all over my bedroom wall. I have a lot of respect for Nikki being able to open up and share. I wish you the best with your sobriety and I hope you find happiness Nikki Sixx!!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you love well-researched, well-written biographies this book is for you.  With enough background information to  place Lincoln and each of the other characters in Lincoln's cabinet ( and characters they were) in both the overall context and their personal contexts, the book focuses on Lincoln's ability to charm and weedle men of enormous egos and disparate viewpoints into working together for the betterment and continuation of the Union.  Another winner from an expert Presidential biographer.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read for those interested in modern warfare.  Great job by Chris Kyle.  A great person both on and off the Battlefield.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love love love! Keeps me wanting more! I couldn't put it down, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next! Totally recommend to buy!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is fine for the Kindle, works great. I bought 2 and I would recommend  this product to anyone who owns a kindle.
B0070066DI|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this thing is QUIET.  I bought it for an HTPC build and as far as silence is concerned it is a great product.  The problem is the cooler and fan extend beyond the top edge of the motherboard making a build in a tight HTPC case impossible.  Put it in a silent build office mid tower instead.  Installation there was still difficult, that last motherboard screw in the top corner took some real trickery to tighten.  The cooler couldn't be installed with the motherboard in the case.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|This book has a Clancyesque feel to it. The pace was just right. It was complex enough to be interesting yet not so much that you got overwhelmed with irrelevant detail. I'm looking forward to the follow up books.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fine but you have to skip the offer at the beginning of each game which can be annoying.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book. Very sensitive view of a child who was avowed by parents.  E joyed every moment reading and it had a good ending. I recommend it highly.
0393338398|4.0|\\"A new way to play ball\\" -- as I would call it. Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis is a fictional novel, based on a true story, that tells the story of how the Oakland A's turned their game right side up, despite their financial problems. I chose to read this book because I am a former baseball player and have some knowledge about how the game is played.<br /><br />Billy Beane is the manager of the Oakland A's. To the scouts, he showed potential as a baseball player and was dragged out of college to play in the minor leagues. To everyone's disappointment, however, the scouts were wrong. As a manager, Beane wants to find players good enough to lead the A's to championships, but faces the problem of not having enough money to recruit the best.<br /><br />This story shines a new light at how we look at things. It's evidence that the majority can be wrong -- that money isn't everything. Ignorant to generations of scouts and their hard work, Beane discovers a new way to find the best players at low costs. I enjoyed reading the eclectic opinions of different characters in the book. I was able to understand why Beane made the choices that he did, from different angles.<br /><br />I was impressed by the way that Lewis set up the scenes and atmosphere. The author not only well depicted the location, but also used carefully selected words in dialogue to give readers a feel of what the speaker is feeling. One of the strongest feelings that Lewis set in this story is the \\"unfairness\\" of this game. Throughout the text, you will find body language, word choice, and decisions that all point towards the unwelcomed disadvantage of the Oakland A's.<br /><br />It remains a mystery to me; how Lewis understands all the details of baseball and is able to include this in his writing. By reading this book, I learned a lot about how baseball teams are formed and how managers function behind the scenes. Lewis may have done research to be able to provide us with this information, key to the story.<br /><br />I give this book four out of five stars because the ending was not very satisfying the the reader. I would recommend this book to high schoolers who can well grasp the concept of money or who want to learn about a career as an athlete.
B000002BE9|5.0|The quality of the music meets expectations of original disk. I recommend to any customer who appreciates sultry, melancholy music from pop jazz artist  Fiona Apple. Full of mood and angst.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is such a simple and addictive game. I would reccomend everyone to buy it. It is a great way to kill time! Run little guy run!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|OK...so what if I had read the books out of order? Come on people, these are really good books here!!! I can only hope everyone  reads  these books.   ____ Preferred not to be named...
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Um ok it took reading the whole book to gain some reasoning behind the maze. Exhausting. Hopefully the next book can tell the story better.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This is a True to Life movie I am a close friend to an intercontinental pilot who could put this kind of movie to shame ..The difference is the person (pilot) I know NEVER had an incident with any kind of investigation needed...I've been here & Seen the partying just the same as the opening scene... Great Movie ..NO GUNS NO Shooting ..Just REALISTIC LIFE of A SINGLE person with a TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY !!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|this movie is a great feel good movie, one with a powerful lesson for all, which tells of what lenth one will go to, to save a life from the pits of the gang life, this is a must see if you are a clint eastwood fan.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Well for one it's FREE!!!!! And two kids and adults would love this app when ever you are bored. You won't pay a penny!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I just love this movie I can't really say anymore, but to say I loved this movie so much I had to get the indiviual movies of each mega stars movie yes I bought the hulk, captin america, iron man 1 and 2, and thor so I can see where they all came from to mess into this great movie a must see if you love marvels heros.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I was always at the edge of my seat wondering what was next, while the ending isn't what I expected it shows that this trilogy will always leave you guessing.<br />I personally hated the ending but also believe I'm one of the few who would say so, the story being so amazing all in itself.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|this is a colorful movie love the animations, the color, the sound effects just a feel good movie for all to see.
B00138F4OK|5.0|Of course I bought the album- who can resist? It's filed with classic songs that everyone needs to hear! I actually use some of them for my workout playlist.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this is one of the great animations you will see I love this feel good story about a young girl whom wants live her life out of the norm of the day, a real good feel good story.
B00846REIS|4.0|I felt there were Way too many similarities to fifty shades of grey, but overall I enjoyed the read. If you enjoyed fifty shades of grey you can't not like this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really liked this book because it had everything, from humor to heartache. Connor and Megan were really good characters and there was lots of dialogue and interaction between the two. Connor is funny and really gets his \\"come-uppance\\". Will definitely read more from this author. Hope you enjoy!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I loved this movie......great plot, great villain, great hero.....tons of action!!!!<br />Just lots of fun.<br />It's definitely worth the watch!
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book was so insightful.  The information and science behind the food we eat that was provided in this book almost forces you not to eat processed food, sugar, etc. Ever, Again.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Awesome Show.  Great Cast, Great stories, It's all great.  Keep up the great work for many more years to come I hope!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE TILES.  I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THE CURRENT TILES.  IF THERE IS A WAY TO CHANGE THE TILES, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT YET.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|A great book.  The camel club adventures never cease to keep the thrills and drama on high alert.  Highly recommended
B000YIGNKE|1.0|NONE OF THE VERSIONS OF &#34;PERSUASION&#34; IS AS TRUE TO THE BOOK, TO AUSTEN, AND TO THE TIME PERIOD AS THE COLIN FIRTH &#34;PRIDE AND PREJUDICE&#34;, BUT THIS IS THE LEAST SATISFACTORY OF ALL.<br /><br />ANNE ELIOT IS NOT A TEARY NONENTITY, ELIZABETH IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE ANNE'S MOTHER, ETC., ETC.  UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THE PREVIOUS CRITICISMS WERE JUSTIFIED!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. I had no trouble what so ever playing on my kindle fire. only the first half of the game is actually free. you have to pay to finish it. loved the graphics. would have gave 5 stars if game had been longer. finished in 2 days.
B000056HE9|5.0|A great Christmas classic.  Stick with this one--don't both with the remake.  It's is a great Cary grant movie.  I watch it every year--a tradition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen. Is it gory? Yes. But what show isn't. Don't miss an episode!
B00003CXFV|5.0|My husband thinks this is a depressing movie but I find it empowering!  A little known person can make a big difference in society.  There are a couple of classic lines--overall a timeless movie?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple but has everything you will need for basic and even some advanced math. Worth the space on the kindle.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|My husband and I both liked this book.  Jurek's running story is interesting.  I was most interested in the progression from meat eater to a much healthier vegan type diet.  There are some good recipes.  He explains the things that worked for him as we'll as the things that did not work for him.  This book along with the dr Furman books and the Christine Pariello books serve as a great inspiration for a health lifestyle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game it is free and that is the best part. plus it is very fun!!!!!!!!! it is a awesome. game.
0470913029|2.0|This book came with another book I ordered, The Paleo Diet Cookbook, in good time and well packaged.  Upon inspection and reading, I decided this wasn't the diet I wanted to follow after all, so I gave it to a friend.
B00881VLCE|5.0|By far the best jigsaw puzzle app I've ever tried. A lot of interesting puzzles come with and you can also buy more, but I wish it had more free ones.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED this book-- I would read everything this author has to offer just wish they were all on Kindle as it is I have ordered all available in paperback. Her writing is realistic and believable. This story about life choice was very thought provoking and on some level understandable Although I hoped the ending would have been different. I came to understand and have empathy for the decission made. JO JO MOYES writes with heart.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|I can't wait to watch this dvd, again and again.  Slipknot really rocks and these boys know how to push entertainment to the limits...! Who cares about blue-ray quality, it's about doing what they love for us to enjoy.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Lets hope this is the last time I have to buy Bladerunner. The extras are well done, and there is plenty of commentary from Ridley Scott and the producers - pretty much anyone who had a major roll in the film. This blu-ray will get a lot of use.
1439153663|5.0|really enjoyed reading 'the kitchen house' - eye opener - amazing time in history - amazing characters - survival skills second to none and love of family amongst the blacks heartwarming
1594745692|5.0|The illustrations are incredible. This is a really fun and creative deck. The book was even made to look old. You won't be disappointed.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Well paced and great escapist work. I reccomend it along with the other Jack Reacher books. Couldn't put it down.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I enjoyed the book because it is well written, with good research support.  Parents, educators and business managers would benefit from the documented information.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I think setting this show in an asylum gives it an opportunity for much more interesting stories and characters.  It was hard to stay with one family in one house last season.  By the end of season one I was exhausted and not willing to take so many leaps of faith.  This season is already a huge improvement because the weirdness is spread around.  Like all Ryan Murphy series, this one is very stylish with great music and a great cast
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Unlike many war films that try to be too broad in their approach, Full Metal Jacket is focused, intense and shows war as horrible, absurd reality. From the opening boot camp story of Cowboy and Joker through the recapture of Hue city during the Tet Offensive of 1968, Stanley Kubrick takes us on a dark journey. There is animosity and disagreement among Americans and their South Vietnamese allies; there is genocide; there is civilian pain and suffering as well as civilian antagonists. There is heroism, needless death and many questions left unanswered. Few movies capture war as intensely and as head on as this one, it is an all-time classic film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the third book!  And I can't wait to see the next two movies...the books go into much more character detail...so it will be fun watching the movies after having already read the books. :-)
B006AN78XS|1.0|I saw  this movie in the theater and wish that I had walked out, rather than waste my time. Cinnematographich shots of paris were the only thing that was not awful. Acting, plot and directing were horrible.  If you think for yourself and do not just go for faces and names then this movie is not for you.
0736092269|5.0|this is the only book you need to buy. i bought 3 books and out of the three this one was the most informative. i hve lifted dumb bells off and on for 15 years and this book is by far the best that i have come across
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I think this was awesome girlfriend movie, funny and quirky great timing and sense of humor makes this movie fun to watch.
B007MDB71O|3.0|So this movie is actually quite good, but there are issues. Why not stick to the original title \\"Princess of Mars\\"? Then there's Taylor Kitsch....he has no chutzpah, no screen presence, he's just there, a hyperactive underwear model on the go. He kills franchises, that's what he does. Entertaining but flawed movie.
1451695195|3.0|I read this after my pet of 17 years died, and my reason was that I wanted someone to definitely say whether or not animals were in heaven.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's book is compelling in that it draws a very detailed picture in your mind of what the afterlife is like, and the picture matches up in many important ways with a LOT of what Judeo-Christian theology has been teaching for several millennia. It also really grabs you with the premise that the experience itself and the recovery were medically impossible. The message that God is love, that we continue to be immersed in this love, that there is a punishment of a kind after death but that it is apparently mild and ultimately temporary, who doesn't want to hear that?<br /><br />But the problems are large. Another reviewer, Tom Davies, has pointedly asked about the medical foundations for Dr. Alexander's statements - was his cortex destroyed, or not? If it was, was it miraculously repaired? If it wasn't destroyed, then this is no miraculous experience. If it was, there should be some kind of scan or MRI to back up his statements that his brain was definitely offline. Are there tests to show definitely what was happening in his brain? What do other doctors say?<br /><br />For me this was only a minor problem in comparison with some others.<br /><br />In interviews subsequent to publishing this book, Dr. Alexander has confirmed that he now believes that religions are only true insofar as they teach \\"oneness\\" or \\"allness\\" of all existence, and that he continues attending a Christian church because he's comfortable with Christian ritual, not because he endorses it. It would be so easy to accept his vision and not even notice that it is replacing Christian belief. He has also stated in several subsequent interviews that \\"reincarnation is an absolute must\\". He hasn't said much about Jesus, but refers to \\"teachers\\" who visit the earth, implying that Jesus was one of these. No Christian can accept these statements and remain truly Christian. Was Jesus reincarnated? If so, as who? Going down that path gives us weaker and weaker answers.<br /><br />In order to accept his vision and what he says about it, you have to first decide that NDE's are a reliable way to come to the truth about what happens to our soul after death, even though many of them are irreconcilable.<br /><br />You then have to discard the very definite statements by many Old Testament prophets, Jesus, St. John the Baptist, St. John the Apostle, and all the apostles and saints who clearly contradict what Dr. Alexander now believes. You have to decide that Jesus had nothing supernatural about him, was probably not resurrected, that the apostles who believed he was God were mistaken, and the witness of the many very holy saints who confirm that there is a judgement and a Hell were misled or have misinterpreted bogus visions. You have to believe instead that Dr. Alexander is a superior authority to them, that our one soul has many lives, that this is probably just one of its many lives, and that God keeps sending us back here to learn, even though apparently many of us don't learn.<br /><br />What he says about reincarnation, punishment, and heaven also leaves something else unanswered: Granted it sounds wonderful, but why would anyone try very hard to become a better person here if we die tomorrow and get another chance as soon as we're sent back? That ultimately trades being accountable for feeling good, and doesn't match up with my understanding of God.<br /><br />So beware. It's an interesting read, and it's clear that Dr. Alexander believes what he is telling us.  It's very tempting to swallow whole, but I recommend not embracing it as an answer.
B008FH9J5M|1.0|I have purchased music from amazon, and have never had a problem before. I purchased this Chris Brown Deluxe Version Explicit, and to this day, I have no music from the album, not one song.  I listened to clips before purchasing the album on amazon, that's what made me interested in making the purchase.  I saw where it indicated that the purchase was complete, it's even in my account showing that I can manage the album sinced the purchase.  Still no music.  This is one of my favorite artists, and right now I'm just disappointed in, how my purchase was transacted, and I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE ALBUM TO DOWNLOAD IN MY CLOUD OR ON MY DEVICE, BUT MY MONEY IS GONE.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Amy Chua deserves credit for putting part of her life story on show for all to see, seemingly warts and all. Furthermore she did have to spend a lot of time righting many of the misconceptions of the book. Of which I was a victim thinking the book had a different premise from all the reviews I had read.<br /><br />One can easily choose to focus on their opinions of Amy rather than looking at it as a book worth reading to which I would most definitely give a yes. For it was entertaining, thought provoking and honestly I couldn't put it down so for all those reasons it is worth the read. Now that's certainly not saying I agree with the many opinions and conclusions Amy comes to. In fact, I found myself mostly disagreeing but I did appreciate how she brought her ideas and experiences across often in a humourous way.<br /><br />As a Christian I looked at it from a different perspective seeking to learn, understand and reflect on myself as a parent but knowing that we have different starting points. It is just my thought that the goal in this book is all about \\"getting\\". Getting birthday cards, getting status, getting reputation, getting respect, getting your kids to take of you and on it goes. Now some might argue that she gave to her children and that is right but my sense was it was giving to get. And while ambition and striving and certainly good virtues to instill into your children I would add that \\"giving\\" is far greater and more difficult virtue to cultivate. After all when we inadvertently teach our children that people are always your competition it could lead to a superiority complex at best or the world revolves around me at worst.<br /><br />Again, it's a great book to read because it gets people talking about parenting and important issues in life and therefore I would put it on the recommend list!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great calculator, easy to see, easy to use! would definitely recommend.<br />and the best part is that it is free!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Every thing this Alarm/Reminder does and offers has got to be the best new tool I have ever had-It keeps me calm when needed.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle delivers a great story that most veterans can relate to in some shape or form; descriptive and a fun read. He takes us through the whole process of getting ready for war, the combat, and trying to readjust and reintegrate with our families.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Love Denzel Washington.  I recommend all his movies. He keeps you entertained in all his movies. Tremendous story line and keeps you. drawn in. Please buy it and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome. I challenge my bro to beat me and we have an awesome time. It is also a great time spender.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I love comic book films and I have seen my share of abortions when it comes to them. When I heard there was plans to reinvent Judge Dredd, I was curious to see what it would be. When I saw that Karl Urban would be filling the shoes that Stallone completely wore out I was very eager to see this re-creation.<br /><br />Dredd is two hours of non stop action, witty one liners and pure awesomeness. The plot is simple the characters are fun to watch and the whole package is a perfect one two punch on the entertainment scale. I don't know if this will be the only one or if there will be more adaptions of this comic book down the road. If they keep the cast, the director and the style that this film was, then I'm sold.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was the best book in the series yet. It's very emotional though so be prepared for that. I recommend this series to anyone.

1451695195|5.0|This book was very interesting and well worth the wait. Amazing to see the changes  a man of medicine went through,having changed so many attitudes and survived to share the tale. As always, it took no time for my shipment to arrive.I have always received them when they were expected if not before. I thoroughly enjoyed the reading and look forward to finishing the one I bought from Amazon that I'm reading now. Thank you for your effort.<br /><br />Coralie

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a wonderfully written trilogy with lots of action to entertain one, ending sadder than expected was hoping for the old fashion happily ever after but it would have ruined it any other way. Loved it, thank you Suzanne for keeping me up unable to stop reading your work.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Great music. Moving and powerful; both soothing and thought-provoking. More than just background, this is music that can make me stop what I'm doing and just listen. Thank you, Ray!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Seriously, I was going through withdrawals (from the show) so I bought it rather than wait for it to come out on netflix.
0670023329|5.0|A very harrowing story that is miraculous as it is bizarre and sad. I have recommended it to many friends.

B008M87GJK|2.0|I downloaded two similar news apps to compare them and ended up deleting the app for BBC, since I didn't need both.  It was okay  but I preferred the content of the other one.  For some reason also, BBC would appear upside down and not relocate itself to the orientation I prfer to hold the reader, also.
0143122010|5.0|Dr. Steven Pinker meticulously and elegantly details the historical impetuses and psychological changes that have taken place throughout human history that have led to the decline of violence that we are living in today. He explains in detail with detailed charts and graphs these historical changes and provides clear cut evidence how violence in the past was much higher to the present day and how today we are living in the most peaceful time in human history. This may be a shock to some people who tend to focus on the \\"Twitter\\" age or the instant news age when every news story is available and sensationalized from every part of the globe. The fact remains that not only has violence has gone down dramatically, but the things that we care about today and value such as universal human rights, the rights of women, the rights of homosexuals, the rights of animals and so on are concerns that we could not have imagined having had in the past! A highly recommended and informative book that I recommend to all! If you want to understand the nature of the history of violence throughout history, this book is a must read. We truly are living in the most peaceful time in the existence of our species.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|There is no unlimited play on a tablet, probably due to CPU or RAM limitations. This was not advertised as well as I would have liked. Otherwise, it's the Plants v Zombies we all know and love.
