B001P5Q6FC|5.0|I've been a big fan of Lamb of God ever since I got both \\"New American Gospel\\" and \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" six years ago, and since then I've gotten all of their CD's, and they've been one of my favorite metal bands, and they're still are to this day. Their latest release, 2009's \\"Wrath\\" is simpy an awesome new release that attacks you like a caged animal, pound your face in, and melt through your brain like butter, and afterwards you'll be feeling mighty proud to have enduring the wrath that this album possesses. Trust me, the album's title speaks for itself. These guys just continue to get better and better with every CD they put out. I've never heard an album by Lamb of God that I didn't like, they just don't dissapoint whatsoever. For \\"Wrath\\", Lamb of God have brought in Josh Wilbur to handle the production duties instead of Machine (who produced \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" and \\"Sacrament\\") giving this album a real aggressive and raw sound and feeling from every angle. Randy Blythe is in top form as always, belting out those raging demonic roars that he's best known for, but he also ventures into some melodic screaming every now and then especially on songs such as \\"In Your Words\\" and \\"Set to Fail\\", while guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler both crank out lots of sharp, meaty, and blistering buzzsaw riffs that are just plain heavy, and they also throw in some excellent solos and some nice melodic touches as well. I really like how these guys are throwing in more guitar solos in their songs now than they did before. Bassist John Campbell keeps the charge going with heavy, hammering basslines, and Chris Adler's drumming is absolutely fast and blistering as hell throughout. Kicking off the album is \\"The Passing\\" which is a brief but gorgeous melodic instrumental that leads into the blistering \\"In Your Words\\", and that is when the headbanging really begins. \\"Set to Fail\\" (which is my favorite song here) has some fast, hammering drums in the beginning, as well as awesome lethal, buzzing riffs, great melodic screams from Randy, and I also love the guitar solo around 2:35, and \\"Contractor\\" is a raw, fast, straight forward thrasher that features sick, trail blazing double bass drumming that really rips through your ears. Other blistering cuts that I like here including \\"Grace\\" (which starts off with a nice and soft melodic guitar intro before going into another blistering metal onslaught, and there's also another awesome solo included as well), \\"Fake Messiah\\", \\"Everything to Nothing\\", \\"Choke Sermon\\", and the fantastic album closer \\"Reclamation\\" which starts off and ends with some excellent acoustic guitars. I definately rank \\"Wrath\\" among Lamb of God's best albums, and in my humble opinion, it's also the best album that they've released thus far. It just goes to show that these Virginia boys continue to get better with each release, and they're still a force to be reckoned with in today's metal world. I highly recommend this awesome new album to all fans of Lamb of God and metal alike. Hope I was helpful to the whole metal community. Peace!!ethal, buzzing riffs, great melodic screams from Randy, and I also love the guitar solo around 2:35, and \\"Contractor\\" is a raw, fast, straight forward thrasher that features sick, trail blazing double bass drumming that really rips through your ears.

0385504225|4.0|I have very mixed feelings about this latest Dan Brown  \\"blockbuster.\\" As in his other novels, he keeps the suspense alive, and adopts the same technique of having each mini-chapter end on a note of extreme apprehension, so the reader feels compelled to read the next chapter. This book IS a page-turner!     Although the progression of events was quite enthralling, at some point the denouement of the entire drama became rather obvious.  The location of the great world-shattering \\"Secret\\" was quite evident for me about 2/3 through the book. And it seemed that the good Professor Langdon, instead of becoming smarter and more perceptive through the series of adventures he had been involved in with previous Dan Brown books (Angels and Demons, and DaVinci Code)  actually became dumber and dumber.     Having been deceived once at the beginning of the story, he easily fell into the \\"Bad Guy\\"s  ambush later and seemed to be so myopically bound by his great \\"expertise\\" as a vaunted Harvard scholar, that he failed to discern the obvious at many points in the book.      The revelation of the Great Secret near the end was a total flop and it was hard to believe that a group of powerful, aware people (high-level Masons) could dedicate their entire lives to concealing and protecting an age-old \\"secret\\" that in the end turned out to be very mundane.      The involvement of the highest levels of the CIA seemed a bit ludicrous. The idea that the Bad Guy could basically overturn the political world as we know it by releasing his video and thus cause a major \\"national security event\\" seemed grossly exaggerated once the contents of the video were revealed.      But the participation of the CIA did provide a lot of opportunity for high-speed SUV chases, black helicopter interventions, and special-ops agents doing their thing. I can already imagine a somber-expressioned Tom Hanks careening through the streets of DC trying to forestall the dastardly deeds of the Bad Guy in the next Dan Brown flick.     The very apotheosis of the book quite surprised me (pun here, read book to \\"get it\\") --and not in a good way. After all the harrowing events, the revelation of the Secret of the Ages, and the final moment of jubilation and discovery by the exhausted hero and heroine, the latter delivers a pedantic and lengthy lecture to Langdon! All while they are positioned in a kind of cliff-hanger location, awaiting the very last revelation in the book.     I realize that I have panned this book pretty badly. Nonetheless, it raises fascinating questions about the nature of human consciousness and how our consciousness interfaces with the \\"external\\" world.  Dan Brown briefly references some amazing discoveries at the frontiers of physics and consciousness studies. And the book as a whole attempts to connect these contemporary discoveries with ancient wisdom.            As in his other books, Dan Brown is a master of the graphic, dramatic image. The final scene depicting the Bad Guy is absolutely unforgettable. There are also many fascinating facts about architectural \\"mysteries\\" around Washington, DC. I am sure any reader who visits DC will see it in a totally different light.     All in all, the book IS entertaining, and for that I will somewhat grudgingly give it 4 stars. But it could have been so much tighter and had vastly more impact. The basic theme of the book---the converging of ancient wisdom with leading-edge science--offers tremendous opportunity for some really powerful storytelling. Hopefully Dan Brown's next book will be better crafted and, if it has Langdon as a protagonist, will show the good Prof getting brighter as he goes along.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is Another masterpiece from Clint Eastwood. Jolie shines as Christine Collins who is the mother of a missing boy who disappears while she fulfills her obligations as a roller skate wearing telephone operator supervisor at a huge substation in LA. There are many twists to the story resulting from LAPD bugling yet another case in their long laundry list of mishandled crime investigations. Jolie plays the role of a hard working, intelligent, sensitive, unrelenting, hopeful mother who is tirelessly looking for her son. She becomes aided by John Malkovich who follows her case closely, using his bully pulpit to expose the LAPD for all of it's inconsistencies. Malkovich again shows why he's revered as the greatest character actor that ever donned a supporting role. All this starts out when a boy is retrieved from Illinois where he is used as a surrogate for her real son. Jolie is able to sell the fact that mothers are the ones that really know their sons. The LAPD takes the fact that Jolie's refusal to accept the boy as her son as being authentic to being delusional, shirking responsibility and \\"just plain nuts\\" Jolie then is \\"thrown\\" into the insane asylum where she undergoes many demeaning things. Jolie shows how smart and clever she can be in this role by assimilating herself into the asylum population while being conformant with the hospital doctors to prove she is not insane. If you watch carefully during the scenes where Christine Collins is restrained there is a day nurse that is played by Riki Lindhome who also plays the character of Mardell Fitzgerald in Eastwoods classic \\"Million Dollar Baby\\".     The movie takes a twist when Malkovich character exposes that the LAPD is having women incarcerated in a mental hospital when they are deemed public relations risks by the LAPD. Jeffery Donavan plays the stereotypical role of the Irish police captain who gets caught in the middle of a mess when it is found that citizens are wrongly put in the mental hospital and asecond part of the mystery is uncovered when a runaway illegal alien from Canada reveals that he helped Gordon Northcutt in the mass murder of 20 boys at his ranch. This all comes to a head in a double trial where the mass murder and LAPD are both put on trial in a secretive proceeding put on a alternate docket to avoid press coverage. Jason Butler Harner's creepy portrayal of the ice cold mass murder Northcutt showed this deranged man, and his twisted attraction to Jolie's character which culminates to an unprecedented meeting between his character and Jolie's to finally confess to killing her son, However on her arrival he reneges on his deal to tell all, for fear of \\"going to hell\\". Jolie's interaction in this scene is electric when she repeatedly asks him \\"did you kill my son\\" over and over finally pressing herself to him nose to nose with gritted teeth. To me this was the epitome of great acting. I have this Tivoed on my system and highly recommend it be added to your DVD collection
B0025KVLV0|3.0|I'm not to hip at times when something classic gets remastered. Sometimes the enhancement is a little to much. As for \\"Let It Be\\" not to bad. I have music enhancement software on my computer and using my older copy was able to follow what they did to get that better sound. From what I can tell just a little touch up was done ... But ... You might find that some of the CD players out there may not play the new recording or least some of the tracks as in my case. My computer was unable to read and download track 12 (The song Let It Be) and one of my two players would skip the same track after playing the others before it just find. I had to manually go to the track to get it to play. I'm guessing it has something to do with the way it is formatted. To the average Beatles fan you will like the new sound but as for me I am going to stick with the older CD versions and I have all 13 plus Past Masters Vol. 1 & 2 ... I use them as masters for the copies I burn which I can record with a sharper and cleaner sound than these remastered versions that are on the market now.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|AIC is back! If you are an AIC fan, don't hesitate to buy this CD.     I have every \\"Alice In Chains\\" CD (including the Music Bank), Jerry's solo discs (including both versions of \\"Degradation Trip\\"), and Mad Season's \\"Above\\". Like many, I miss Layne - but musically and lyrically, this is a true \\"Alice In Chains\\" CD. William DuVall does a great job at a very difficult task: \\"fitting in\\" with AIC without trying to imitate Layne.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|I think often times many people are so critical of movies they don't find most movies enjoyable.  As in this case with \\"Last House On The Left\\", I agree with some of the faults, but think those who criticize are losing sight of the powerful story behind this movie.    Violence is a reality unfortunately and many families and individuals are subjected to home invasions, robberies, attempted murders, and worse.  Of course our reaction if we can retain courage is to defend ourselves.  HOWEVER, what intensifies such a situation even more is having your child a victim of crime and realizing the person/persons involved are in your guest house right next door! That very thought is horrifying.    As here we go with \\"Last House On the Left\\". Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter are outstanding as the grief stricken parents who come to terms that their daughter's attackers are within their presence and they must do what they have to do to get their daughter medical attention. The tension at times in the film was breathtaking, especially when Monica's character realizes the truth about their visitors and she must converse with one in her kitchen with her injured daughter laying in the next room. Wow,  powerful!  Kudos to Monica for her sincere portrayal.    While some criticize that there wasn't much emotional progression in the movie between Tony and Monica's characters from the first killing to the continuing attempts. In a realistic situation like that, there's not a lot of time to think! I think at key points in the movie, their looks into each other's eyes said it all. Yes, they could have tried to make a getaway in the boat without confrontation or violence, but at the risk of the criminals catching on or finding their daughter?  Primal instincts of protection of their children and survival instincts kicked in.    As for the bloody violence, the \\"first evil one to go down\\" scene could have been done without the garbage disposal, that almost pushed the scene over the top.  Anda MAJOR agreement I have is the final microwave scene.  I'll leave it at that.  The parting shot at the lake would have made me give an extra star had it ended there, but if I watch it again, it'll be on DVD where I can press the forward button at the ending lake scene and go right to the ending credits.    I do agree the rape scene is horrific and disturbing. However, I do understand the use of that scene as from that point on, I wanted to see the evil get their due. Kudos to the director for making Mary and Paige (played effectively by those actresses too) for not being helpless victims.  Every chance they got they fought to get away.  Good for them.    I would like to commend the director for inserting a sympathetic character into the evil victimizing group.  That served as atleast somewhat of a balance so the evil didn't wholly envelop the film.    In closing, we all have opinions about movies and the right to express them.  I try to be as open minded as possible in seeing what the point of a movie is and what I can get out of it.  This one clearly said DON'T MESS WITH MY DAUGHTER OR ELSE!  I have to respect that. I know there are others who saw this movie who agree.  For those who don't, you have that right.  I also don't know if I'll watch it again, but I'm glad I did see it.    Sincerely,  William
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I recall seeing the original movie when I was 18 or 19..(1979) and after 30 years, someone mentioned the movie again, so I thought to purchase it. This is a highly edited version and I would not recomend wasting the money to purchase it.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|I was expecting more from this movie.  Something like the way the 1st X-Men movie started, or how well done the second movie was.  I'm glad I rented instead of buying.  It started out ok and there were nice references to the other movies, but over all it turned into just another cheesy super hero movie.  I can't count the amount of times the claws were shown for no reason.  It just became so lame.      So anyway I suggest renting it, if you like it you like it, if not...
B002ELM5HY|4.0|More festive tracks like on \\"Golden Heart\\" than \\"5:15 AM\\" or the Dire Straights-like last tracks off of \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\".  Well worth the listen, Mark Knopfler continues to surprise and entertain in complex musical forms.  There are other singer/songwriters out there today, but Knopfler continues to stand out in his expressiveness and variations in both story and music.  I suggest you put this one on, turn the lights down, listen and enjoy.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Sahara is the right mix of adventure, intrigue and history, rolled into one. This film never has a dull moment and characters you will love.
B002HNA95E|2.0|After months of waiting for the release of this compilation, it was very disappointing to find out that many of the sought after SINGLE VERSIONS of the songs are not to be found on this collection.  Many of us die-hard Madonna fans had expressed our hope to be able to obtain these hard to find versions on this collection.  It would've been great to get the original single versions of HOLIDAY, LUCKY STAR, BORDERLINE, LIVE TO TELL, LIKE A PRAYER (7\\" Version only available on the Promo CD), CHERISH, EXPRESS YOURSELF, VOGUE.  Other songs could've been presented in their original album versions like OPEN YOUR HEART, CRAZY FOR YOU, LIKE A VIRGIN (instead of the awful Immaculate Collection mixes).  Other songs that could've been presented in the single versions though already available on GHV2 like FROZEN, TAKE A BOW, could've allowed the inclusion of a few more songs that haven't been included in previous compilations like TRUE BLUE, SPOTLIGHT, CAUSING A COMMOTION, WHERE'S THE PARTY, GAMBLER, and others.  I hope Warner Bros. will release a better compilation than this, that will include ALL SINGLES in their SINGLE VERSIONS.  A boxed set of replicas of her singles on CD like they released in Japan several years ago would be a Madonna fan's dream come true.
B000PHX8C0|5.0|If DevilDriver's previous album The Fury of Our Maker's Hand was a confirmation that DevilDriver was one of the most praiseworthy bands to jump on the American metal scene in years, then The Last Kind Words is DD driving a tank, crushing all in their path to claim their thrones as metal royalty and dropping a nuclear bomb on all those beneath them.    What makes this album so great is two factors. First, instead of following their contemporaries, and coping the endless hordes of bands with \\"core\\" at the end of there genre title, they serve up a slab of good ol' American groove metal. Second, every song on this album has a groove metal base, but on many songs they add sprinklings of different genres of metal, so that each track has a unique feel to it. Even with all this variety, no track on this album sound odd or out of place, weak or unmemorable.     Here is how the tracks break down:  \\"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\\" -  This intro is so brutal, it basically grabs you by the hair and keeps slamming your head against the wall, takes a break during the melodic solo, then gets right back to beating your head in.  \\"Clouds over California\\" - I think if I had a dollar for every time that I have listened to this song, then I probably would have enough cash to buy an island. This is my favorite DD track ever.  \\"Bound by the Moon\\" - The track has a thrash vibe during the verses, and a melodeth vibe during the chorus. Excellent track  \\"Horn of Betrayal\\" - Love the opening guitar/drums and this has my favorite lyrics on the album.   \\"These Fighting Words\\" - The melodeath influence gives this track a real epic feel. It sounds like Amon Amarth on steroids.   \\"Head on to Heartache (Let Them Rot)\\" - Works up to when Dez growls \\"Before you lose control,\\" then it becomes a headbanger of neck breaking capacity.   \\"Burning Sermon\\" - There is a bouncy riffs throughout this track that can only be described as nu-metal-ish, but sounds like something off their debut, but harder. Love screaming along with the chorus.   \\"Monsters of the Deep\\" - This is a personal favorite of mine. It's got a great doom metal vibe, and is just so heavy, which is hard for lots of metal bands to make interesting. It's so heavy it would give Gojira a boner.   \\"Tirades of Truth\\" - Another track where the guitar/drums are excellent. Love this song even if I keep thinking Dez is saying \\"Tirades of truth, blazing aliens.\\"  \\"When Summoned\\" - Another brutal track, with a chorus that begs to be screamed.   \\"The Axe Shall Fall\\" - Ending the album with a headbanger, that progresses into a soft outro, allowing you time to calm down before having to grab the icepack for your neck.     When I got The Last Kind Words back in '07 I thought that DevilDriver couldn't top their previous album, which was a personal classic to me. To my joy, they dropped an album with excellent vocals/guitars and insane drumming, showcasing more variety and skill. I've probably listened to LKW about as much, if not more, than FooMH. It's one of the many reasons DevilDriver has become one of my favorite bands.
B002FRNCG0|2.0|I'm seeing this band through \\"brand new eyes\\" after listening to this. I really liked Riot! and All We Know Is Falling, but I don't know what happened here. There are really only 3 great songs on this record, so if the MP3 album download is not $3.99 anymore, see below which songs to buy.    Careful - 2nd best song on the record.  Ignorance - 3rd best song.  Playing God - Just an ok song, \\"the way I see it\\".  Brick by Boring Brick - Boring is right, buda pa.  Turn it Off - I agree.  The Only Exception - Exactly right. Not the typical paramore song but not good either.  Feeling Sorry - How I felt about buying this CD after listening this far.  Looking Up - Not so much, this song is bad, bad, bad.  Where the Lines Overlap - \\"No one is as lucky as us?\\" Really??? I think the Twilight success has inflated the band's ego.  Misguided Ghosts - Best song on the record (but too short).  All I Wanted - I'm still left wanting more... Misguided Ghosts would have been a better song to end this misguided record.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|Watched this on SYFY. Pointless remake that comes not even close to Stephen Kings Classic!  80% of this movie is the Husband/Wife \\"complaining/crying\\" and fighting with each other! Terrible casting here. They are suppose to be married come on! Just Dumb from the beginning to the horrible ending.  This movie leaves you wanting more? More what? Corn on the cob? Terrible remake! I can't believe I spent this much time writing this review! Big Disappointment!    Please don't buy this. It doesn't deserve your money! Spend your money on the HILLS RUN RED or a bag of frozen/canned corn instead of this piece of crap!!!!!!!!
0385504225|3.0|This book reads like a screenplay in the opening chapters, then gets a bit tedious with it's descriptions of location, location, location. As the story progresses character development diminishes to the point of assumption. I've read all but the last 20 pages and somehow lost motivation to finish it off as the ending is so flat. Especially disappointing since the book could have had a intellectually stimulating ending what with all the Noetic sciences buildup. Instead we got a mediocre and violent end. Still, I can't wait to re-visit Washington, D.C. and go on a tour to see all that I didn't see.
B00005JKDR|5.0|First, let me just say that it is a very, very good and funny movie, but I will come back to its many good points. I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl `Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did avery good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.
0440237688|5.0|\\"The Giver, is a world without Difference\\" This book was an excellent book. Even if you may not like reading at all this book was a fairly good book. I gave it five starts because it was so wonderfully thought through and put together in a chain of events that kept the reader interested to what the character was feeling. However to any that have read the Giver, you would know that in this world of The Giver, feeling dose not exist. I was interested in this book because it was so much different from the world we see today and the world that was in that book. I think this book is well worth the read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This album is a complete surprise!! I was going to write a much more extensive review, but I think other reviewers here have done well.  The songs are great and anyone who was skeptical of giving this a chance should give this a few spins.  What a great collection of tunes.  Layne would be proud.
0307346617|5.0|Review of World War Z<br /><br />The zombie apocalypse is over. The world has come back from the brink of destruction in this gripping account of the zombie war by author Max Brooks. Each chapter is an interview conducted by (Max Brooks), and is recounted in the voice of the interviewee, with rare interruptions by Mr. Brooks. I listened to the audio book on CD in my car. I believe that the CD's are better than the book. Why? Because we get to hear the accents of the interviewees. The actors doing the voices are A-list, and do a remarkable job of conveying the emotion of the story. The interviews are all fantastic, especially the one about Paul Redeker, the ex-apartheid official who helped save South Africa. I listened to that one twice. I also really enjoyed the interview of the Iranian pilot. The characters interviewed run the gamut from grunts on the ground to high-up officials from various countries. Each story is great in its own way, and only a few times did I get out of the story, and thought:an actor is reading this. The audio book I bought was only $14.99 at Borders, but it was slightly abridged. I'd like to get the book and see what I missed.<br /><br />The social commentary in this work is thought provoking, though you may not even realize what Brooks is hinting at while listening/reading the book. One clever touch is taking famous figures from today, though Brooks doesn't name names, and skewering them for what he imagines they would do if the zombie war became real. He also points out how some countries would contribute to the catastrophe because of their nature--namely, China, Iran, India, Israel, South Africa, and the United States.<br /><br />If you love this book, or are interested in it, you must read the free online stories called Tales from the Zombie War (search online and you'll find it), which take us deeper into the zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />World War Z was highly entertaining and totally worth the time to either read, or listen to it.<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of The Dragon Hunters<br />[...]agon Hunters  [...]
0439023491|5.0|Again Suzanne Collins has written a book that I just couldn't put down.  The senario was so terrible, but I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  As a fourth grade teacher, I couldn't recommend this book to my age students.  However, I have already recommended the series to many of my former students and heard all positive replies.  I disagree with the people who said it was slow in the beginning, possibly because I was so \\"hungry\\" to find out what was going to happen.  You will not be disappointed, other than that you have to wait now for the third book in the series to come out!
0061719544|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It was dark at times; and hilarious at times.  It is clear that Ferguson is gifted at making others laugh.  I picked up the book because I am a fan of his show--I think he's hysterical and much funnier than Letterman or even Leno.  The show is on too late however and I don't have TIVO so if I'm lucky, I get to watch it once a week.  If he had a better time slot he'd probably wipe the floor with the rest of them.  CBS isn't dumb so I'm not sure what it is they're waiting for.
B00009Z574|5.0|Tormato is one of the best Yes albums of all time in my opinion.  I used to listen to it when I was in my teens and early 20's.  I am 47 now and after listening to the CD one time I cannot for the life of me get the song Release out of my head, lol.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Ignore the negative reviews and listen to it yourself. Some of the old fans just will not give this a fair listen. Why they want a band they like to just die, I don't understand. The songs are layered and complex, they don't have a lot of catchy pop type hooks so it may take more than one listen to really get into it.  Also it is very dark with great sludgy JC riffs. Most of the songs seem to be about Layne, death, drugs and regrets. Clearly moving to California hasn't cheered Jerry up that much. He has said in interviews that any of them could have been the one who died. I have been listening to 'Check My Brain' for a while on XM radio. I wasn't crazy about it at first but it began to sound better and better. I still think the CD has several 'stronger' songs.  'Black Gives Way to Blue' probably the hit, 'Your Decision' I think is the best, 'A Looking in View', 'Last of My Kind' are excellent.  I like William's voice he really fits the band very well and it is an advantage to be healthy.
0517548232|5.0|ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON is an essential work by Henry Hazlitt, of the Austrian school of economics. This piece is well-written, clear, simple and powerful. While it appeared first in 1946 (this edition was updated in 1979) the principles are as relevant today as they were then.<br /><br />The book is intended to emphasize general economic principles and \\"the penalties for ignoring them\\". Indeed, issues of inflation, deficit spending, commodity pricing, corporate profits, exports and taxes are very much with us today and look in our future.<br /><br />Economics, Hazlitt states, is the science of seeing both general consequences and secondary consequences. While much is made of the former, little is discussed of the latter and therein lies the danger. Government cannot give to one person or group without first taking from another. It creates nothing of value in that giving but in the taking it diminishes and discourages productivity and administers a negative effect on production and the creation of wealth. There is no justice in redistribution by force.<br /><br />Hazlitt writes profoundly of the dangers of inflation. He says, \\"...all government spending must eventually be paid for out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation\\". Also, \\"Inflation plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably in bitter disillusion and collapse.\\" Strong stuff.<br /><br />On bureaucracy: \\"The bureaucrats do not understand the quasi-automatic system of the market, they are always disturbed by it. They are always trying to improve it or correct it, usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group.\\"<br /><br />Hazlitt has a gift for making the complex, simple and the abstract, concrete. This book is particularly well-written. In the current debates in Washington, D.C. Hazlitt's voice is one which needs to be heard above the shouting. It is the voice of reason, responsibility and experience. We would be wise to heed that voice.We would be wise to heed that voice.

0307266303|4.0|At first I thought this was going to be a fluffy read about runners and how cool they are, but it has a lot more depth than that. There is some information related to the evolution of running and how our bodies have adapted to running since Neanderthal times interwoven.  It is really quite interesting and thought provoking.      It is also entertaining as it takes you into the lives of these runners a little bit and draws you into supporting them as he describes a series of long distance races throughout the story.  The description of the way of life of the group he encounters who live in the canyons of Mexico is intruiging and made me want to do a little more research on them myself.    A very good read!!
B00004RJ74|5.0|Wow, this is a wonderfully campy, trashy, occasionally sexy, gory grindhouse-style romp.<br /><br />This movie's definitely for the adults in the audience. It's got nudity. It's got vampires, it's got Cheech (a lot of Cheech, if I recall correctly; how many roles did he play?), Tarantino (both alive and un-dead!), Clooney and Hayek. It's got a guy with a gun for his... umm... Y'know. ;) It's got a Super Soaker with holy Water, it's got a crossbow, it's got an automated staking jack-hammer, it's got a priest turning to the dark side (not intentionally).<br /><br />It's just one giant slow-motion train wreck, and wonderfully executed (if campy; the vampire make-up is reminiscent of that from Buffy the Vampire Slayer).<br /><br />If you like vampire movies and/or grindhouse-style movies, you've got to like this. You've just got to. I'd give you a moneyback guarantee, but you never gave me any money.<br /><br />If you don't like it... Well, it's not for everyone. It's crude, it's got bad language and sexual situations.<br /><br />If you *do* like it, you might also like [[ASIN:B00023P4S8 Bordello Of Blood & Demon Knight]] or [[ASIN:B00027JZ3E The Lost Boys]], maybe [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Planet Terror]], for the zombie fans out there.
B0021L8US0|5.0|This movie was very well done for a reasonable $30 million budget. The director has a lot of talent, and it has a better story and makes you care for characters [even the aliens at times] more than these other summer Blockbusters. Michael Bay and McG should be ashamed.
B0001611DI|2.0|Had to see what the hubbub was about with Romero's original \\"classics.\\" So, I got suckered into seeing this steaming pile. I'm giving it two stars pretty much on Romero's name alone, as an innovator in the zombie genre. NOT because it's high cinema, which I really DON'T think it is.<br /><br />To be frank, the movie seems anachronistic and rather tame by today's standards. Sure it was made in the 70's and for the time it was considered to be pushing the envelope. Today, well, it just doesn't hold up against modern zombie movies.<br /><br />I mean, the zombies are just people in blue makeup. Terrifying, I know! (Not so much...) They shamble... Slowly. Like you could get away from them with a brisk walk! (Horrifying!) There was no tension. There was no foreboding terror. Not even a little good-natured shiver going down my spine. Really it was a few hours of boredom. I think at one point I even checked how much longer the movie had left to run (about 1/2 an hour), that how bored I was. I was waiting all movie for some serious zombie munching and was disappointed at its overall absence outside of the last 1/2 hour (and even that was fairly tame and movie-esque, in my opinion; though perhaps forgivable given the era of cinema it was released in).<br /><br />I kept wanting the people to stop being dumb arses and go on a zombie killing spree. I mean, the zombies are slow. They have NO evasion skills. They have no \\"strategery\\" skills (yes, I know, I mean strategy, geez!). The humans have access to a gun store and about all the ammo they can possibly use. The reason they couldn't simply walk around methodically (and briskly!) decapitating zombies or blasting them in the skull with shot guns was WHAT now? I mean, if your first thought is survival isn't the object to eliminate the walking dead so they don't sneak up on you while you're using the can? But no, they just let the zombies go about their business for the first third of the movie.<br /><br />This movie didn't frighten me. It didn't disturb me (unlike 28 Days Later, which was rather disturbing insofar as the \\"infected\\" kept vomiting blood and stuff all over the place). There was maybe one scene of a guy getting ripped apart for being a dumb arse and sticking his arm into a blood pressure monitoring machine's arm strap in the middle of an ongoing zombie invasion. Frankly he deserved what he got and I had zero sympathy for him. That and he was part of a roving band of marauders, so I had double the zero sympathy for him (what's two times zero?)...<br /><br />Yeah, it may have been considered pioneering at the time, but today it's just a piece of tame, anachronistic tripe. If you want something a considerably less tame try the [[ASIN:B0002ABURA Remake]] or the [[ASIN:B001GUYB08 Resident Evil Trilogy]] or [[ASIN:B000GYI3B8 Slither]] or [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Planet Terror]].<br /><br />Sure, the classics are \\"classic.\\" They're the genre's \\"origins.\\" They're good for film school classes and for seeing \\"how far we've come.\\" But do the stand the test of time? Honestly, I've seen better and scarier and less overtly boring.ke 28 Days Later, which was rather disturbing insofar as the \\"infected\\" kept vomiting blood and stuff all over the place).

0385504225|1.0|I definitely love the crypto thrillers, but I am just hitting chapter 104 and this thing is starting to seem like torture porn. Is drawn out torture and the threat of more the only way that the author can think to get the reader emotionally invested in our heroes?  The book starts out with that shadow over it and seems to embrace it throughout.      Not liking this book at all.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Don't know how many more movies Clint will act in, but this is a typically outstanding movie/story for him as an actor/director. Sure I'm a big fan, but you gotta love the way he tells a story. He depicts the contrast of the generations and cultures to a \\"T\\". I wish I could say this is my favorite movie of his, but I just can't single out one of his works. He has so many that have evoked earnest thought and entertainment. Did I mention just plain \\"escape fiction\\". One of the best actor/directors of our time.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I found this book to be waaay to long.  There have been other reviewers who did a very good job of detailing which passages are superfluous, so I won't repeat the detail.    My biggest issue, however, is with the author's attempt to make this a \\"meaningful\\" novel, offering the way to enlightenment and \\"at-one-ment\\" and a revelation. I have to wonder if the author felt that he had made so many literal-minded Christians angry with the Da Vinci Code that he tried to redeem himself by using this book to push the Bible. Or maybe he wanted to piss off more people by saying that the truth is in the Bible, but most religions just don't see it.   Either way, I don't think he succeeded. The plot is too slow moving (even though it takes only 12 hours); the characters are weakly portrayed and the jumps from one point to another are fantastical without being completely entertaining.  At the end I felt that I had been lectured by someone very pedantic and filled with some kind of religious fervor, but I did not fill inspired, touched or renewed.  People will still buy this book even though it's terrible. I know I would have.  But if you can wait for the inevitable DVD, you'll save some money and some time!
0385504225|1.0|This book fails on so many levels.  I've tried not to spoil too much.  Any potential spoiler is marked with a ***SPOILER*** comment.    The biggest flaw is that it is the most anticlimactic novel I can recall reading.  What is the big secrect behind the Mason's lost pyramid?  I won't spoil it for you but it's something you could probably read about in a tourist's pamphlet.  What is the national security crisis that is so critical that a CIA bigshot has to personally get involved with the field work?  Again, I won't spoil it but if you bother to read this book you will be sorely disappointed and in disbelief that the CIA would even get involved in something so laughable.    The storyline is weak.  First it is the search for the lost Masonic Pyramid.  Then it becomes cracking the code found on this pyramid.  We are assured several times that the revealed message leads to an actual place and to something very tangible.  Somehow, and without much explanation, the search for this place morphs into the search for the 'lost word'.  What is so important about this place that we need to seek it out?  Not really sure.  What happens when this word is found?  No explanation.  So we don't really know what the goal of Langdon or his nemesis is and, more importantly, we don't really care.    The motivations of the nemesis are not fully explained.  Why exactly has he declared Katherine Solomon to be his enemy?  Why does he feel the need to kill her and destroy her research?  How exactly did he know what she was researching anyway?  None of this is explained satisfactorily.    Plot holes and unexplained actions abound. ***SPOILERS****  How did Katherine Solomon know to go to the Library of Congress after the destruction of pod 5?  How did Sato know to find Langdon in the Capitol?  This question was asked throughout the story but never truly resolved. How did the CIA get their hands on the video initially? ***END***    Brown makes too many references to his past work.  In one scene Brown blatantly inserts himself into Langdon's shoes to explain how he never intended to cause controversy with his last book on the church.  This is terrible form which breaks the suspension of disbelief.  Also, he again inserts Kryptos (the real life coded statue at CIA headquarters) into the story with an irrelevant subplot. He disingenuously (as well as unconvincingly) tries to imply that Kryptos and the lost Masonic Pyramid are somehow related.    The subject matter of the book is simply not interesting.  There are no eye opening revelations about the Masons.  In fact, Brown acts as more of an apologist than anything, going out of his way not to cast any suspicion on the group.  The result is a boring portrayal and will not inspire the reader to any interest in further researching the Masons.  The other main topic dwells on mysticism and other esoteric topics like ancient animal sacrifice rituals that are supposed to imbue the practitioner with some kind of power.  This kind of nonsense is just unbelievable.  There is a reason these beliefs died out over the course of history.  Everyone knew they were nonsense and stopped practicing them.  Brown makes no converts with his ridiculous portrayal of a man trying to attain immortality through these rituals.    It is clear that Brown stopped writing at many points over the last 6 years only to pick it up again with different ideas which caused some parts to be rewritten.  The result is a jumbled, disjointed, and anticlimactic novel with boring subject matter.
0385504225|4.0|Despite what some people have said, I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow getting going I thought, but it eventually picked up and moved a long. For a kind of a no brainer page turner it is a good read. If you are expecting some sort of awesome revelation, you will probably be dissapointed. All in all, not too bad. Then again I am easily amused. :))
B0000DJZA5|4.0|It's not that this CD is terrible. The Remix/Remastering is excellent.  It's just that Paul Betrayed the Original Premise of the \\"Get Back Project\\" Again.  The Premise was NO OVERDUBS.  Now The Beatles betrayed it themselves during the original sessions.   And Paul Allowed it to happen again.  The Version of \\"Let It Be\\" is the same one that 1st betrayed the no over dub rule. He should have used the \\"There will be no sorrow version from the film and Anthology video.  He also mixed take 1 and 2 of the rooftop \\"Don't Let Me Down\\".  Using the version where Lennon flubs the line would have been sticking to the \\"Warts and All\\" idea. Plus the flub does not ruin the song.  Either the 2nd or 3rd Live Rooftop version of \\"Get Back\\" would have been a more \\"Naked\\" choice than the shortened studio version used here.  Either the 8 plus minute, or Glyn Johns shortened 4 minute Get Back Mix 2 version would have been nice.  The best thing is, with all the \\"Get Back\\" Material in circulation, one can go out and make any version you like to suit your taste. So dig this one, then go out and be creative and make your Own \\"Get Back\\"/ \\"Let It Be\\" Mix.

B000007MVD|5.0|This is the stuff that presents The Beatles as the musical fusion that they were.  As Paul said near the end of the Anthology video, \\"We were this nice little band who could play just about any kind of stuff\\".  And they run the gambit here.  Yes there is a good number of the Hits, but it's the stuff from their club days that is the treasure.  Plus this stuff was recorded with the utmost excellence.  You can even hear the drums. Something George Martin couldn't get right until Emerick & Townsend showed up in 1966.  My Favorites are I Just Don't Understand,  How Come No One Loves me, I Got A Woman, Soldier Of Love, Too Much Monkey Business, Hippy Hippy Shake, & Lucille.  One note on the hits. Some of the Later ones they sang live over the record.  On  A Hard Days Night, The played the song live, but before the program aired, the BBC edited in the records Piano part.  WHY???  But like I said, this is about the material from their club days which runs the spectrum from Country/Rockabilly to R&B.  And all of it is superb.  Fab indeed.

After finishing the book, I increased my running distances and decreased my pain as a result of all things...throwing out my running insoles, arch supports, etc.  I hope you enjoy the adventure as much as I did.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I've never been a fan of 19th century love stories, but even among that category Emma ranks pretty low. I watched this movie because my wife wanted to.

B002FRNCG0|1.0|I first heard of Paramore's \\"That's What You Get\\" and \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" on Rock Band 2, and really liked the high-energy guitar riffs and Hayley's clear singing voice.  When I bought the first two albums, Riot! definitely has more catchy songs than the first album.  When I heard \\"Decode\\", I thought, wow, here's a band that's on fire!  They rock!  I even saw them when they opened for No Doubt, and like another reviewer, was sad because their set was so short!  I eagerly waited for their new album, and pre-ordered it here on Amazon.  When I got it today, I was shocked it was only 40 minutes long.  There has to be at least one gem on this album, right?  WRONG!  There are no catchy tunes on here at all.  What happened?  I imagine the band had to select from a set of songs, not just the 11 that are on this album.  These are the 11 they chose?  I listened to the album from start to finish, and all the songs sound the same, kind of dreary and melancholy.  Yes, the band has been going through tough times, but why do they want to disappoint their fans??

My husband is an active duty Gunnery Sergeant in the Marines. He thought it was great the movie implemented many of the acronyms & terms the Marines use. He had to explain a few of them to me. We've recommended the series to many of our friends, especially our friends who don't know anything about the military. It was nice having seen it on Blu-ray, there are a lot of great scenes, and the special features are awesome.

My family and I enjoy watching this show every time it comes on and we haven't missed a beat of the shows, because we might not catch what the next show is about. It keeps a good main story line going between the main characters and a good story per show as well.

From the the general bias towards magic and superstition over science, the crippling impact of the drought, and the isolation and difficulties that William, his village, and Malawi, the obstacles that they face are huge and clear. Reading the book, I first thought that my experiences in the \\"Third World\\" helped me understand the William's life from the superstition to the the impact of the drought and the opportunistic price gouging during the famine. But that interpretation fails to give enough credit to William and his book. The power of his story and the clarity of the writing surely guarantee that The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind will speak to people regardless of their experience and their home country.

B0024FAR5M|2.0|This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be \\"bad\\" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real \\"bad guys\\" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the \\"good\\" Bikers can't do.    The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.    Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.    Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.    One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.     I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy.
B000WC3AOE|5.0|I bought the collection in HD. Of course the older black & white movie scenes aren't transferred to HD. But, all in all, I liked them. Anyone who lived in this era will enjoy the singers, dancers and the simple stories. The title tells it all. THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT. I bought mine through Amazon too. The sad part is the fact most of the stars of the films shown, are now deceased.<br />Of course it is motion picture history that will never be repeated.<br /><br />Time watching it changed my mind. Terrible transfer to HD. Grainy and too disappointed to watch them again. I have ordered the Blu-Ray but notice that comments made for this version is also bad. If I get it this week and if it is bad, they both go back to Warners. There is no reason that these sets are sloppily done. They should be picture perfect. But, the HD isn't. If Warners could restore the Chaplin movies to perfect quality, where did they go wrong here?<br /><br />The Blu-Ray isn't any better than the HD version. From a studio that restored Charlie Chaplain and the studio that restored all of the early James Bond features, this is a disappointment. These three features are Hollywood's Musical history. I am sure the new head of Warner's DVDs can redo them as they should be done. It's a shame as they are now, but recently recalled and not available to the public.

This CD does not even compare to the music she used to release. Does anybody remember the song 'One Moment In Time?' Or her amazing vocals on 'I'm Every Woman?'      That was the Whitney I was looking for, and sadly, I think that Whitney will never come back again.      I still love her but only because of her old music. Not this CD and certaintly not with her current voice.
0307269981|4.0|Plot Summary:  Lisbeth Salander has severed all contact with Mikael Blomkvist, and she's taken a year to travel the world on the stolen billions she took during the Wennerstrom affair.  A year later, Lisbeth returns to Sweden and purchases an apartment fit for a queen.  While she's been away, her corrupt guardian, Nils Bjurman, has been digging into her past until he finds an ally who wants her dead and has the means to carry it out.  When three dead bodies are found, with Lisbeth's fingerprints on the murder weapon, the police, Mikael, and a group of thugs all start hunting for our elusive heroine.<br /><br />The thrills and chills in this installment were just as compelling as the first novel, and there were some twists that I never saw coming.  As far as the rating, I suppose I'm holding back because Blomkvist and Salander spend the entire book apart.  They communicate a bit, but Lisbeth has cut Mikael out of her life and she only feeds him tips because he stands by her without question.  The plot is electric, but I get the biggest charge when they work together, like some demented Holmes and Watson duo.  I'm hoping that book three will have them back in action together.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist was almost a secondary character this time around, and the whole book focused on Lisbeth.  By the end of the book, all of her mysterious background is spread out and laid bare, and it's morbidly fascinating.  There are a few `oh no' moments, when it looks like Lisbeth is about to eat it for good, but then the kitten flashes her claws and takes down some formidable foes.<br /><br />There's not much more that I can say without dropping any spoilers, but once again Stieg Larsson has delivered a thriller that is unpredictable and highly entertaining.  The third, and last installment in the Millennium series, [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] will be released on June 8, 2010.

B002HNA95E|1.0|I'd liked to know what Warner's definition is of \\"remastered\\".  The dictionary's definition is:  to make a new master tape or record from an old master tape, usually to improve the fidelity of an old recording.    I don't hear any better quality of the songs.  I guess the operative word is USUALLY.  In this case they didn't improve the fidelity.  They should have labeled it as \\"Repackaged\\" or \\"Remarketed\\" or \\"Sell It To You A Second Time\\".  Save your money!
0385504225|2.0|First off, I liked Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code. I am not easily offended by \\"goofy attacks on religious beliefs\\". And, as a disclaimer, I must say that I read both of the above BEFORE they \\"hit it big\\". So I was free of all the hype.     I wondered if all the hype would now taint me for The Lost Symbol.    Answer:  The hype doesn't matter. This book shatters right through any pretense of excusing it for having \\"too high of expectations\\" or having to \\"live up to the Da Vinci Code.\\"  Brown's writing has gotten much worse. Either that, or he is trying to invent a new way of telling a story.     You all know the plot, so I'll jump right in to my issues with the book. Before I do, I will admit that I do think it could make a good movie. It needs work: a new ending, a good dialogue writer, actors who've never read the story, or can at least create their own interpretation of the cardboard mannequins in the book, and a half-dozen other major changes...    Okay, in no specific order:    1. Sato. Ridiculous. Completely unbeleivable. Laughable. Every time she opens her mouth I questioned her credibility. No way a CIA director acts like that, or is that inept.    2. Inner dialogue. Dan Brown needs to lose about 90% of it.     3. Cliffhangers / suspense.  An author simply CANNOT show that a character discovers something, have everyone else see it, acted shocked by it, talk about it, but then NOT tell the reader what just happened. Brown does this over and over again. If the POV character is in the dark, then it is okay for the reader to be in the dark. Otherwise, it is annoying at best, but usually just a lame attempt to build suspense.    4. Shockers.  The more you build them up, the better they need to be. And these were DUDS. And, they were built up to the max. Astounding! Incredible! Langdon (and his tweed jacket) never could have imagined such a thing! It would rock the world! Destroy nations! Cause armageddon!      ummmmm really? Why? Some dudes participate in rituals, so what?    5. Shockers part two - the big \\"payoffs\\" in the revelation of the final location and of the character were both easily guessed hundreds of pages earlier.  Even if someone didnt figure it out, I can imagine them saying... so what?    Final comment - in the immortal words of that ancient philosopher of the mysteries, he who is known as Spongebob Squarepants ..... \\"ummmm Mr. Brown?  Would you mind writing your books a little bit..... better?\\"

1416550534|5.0|This is the type of book I'm always searching for. A wonderfully written, fantastic story that has an indescribable thread of mystery and magic throughout. I really didn't want it to end, so I'd only read a portion at one time, to save more for later. I was never bored while reading this book, and it really surprised me to see some people described it that way. I can't wait to read more of Kate Morton's books!
B000001ELD|2.0|Back in 1978, at the apex of KISS' commercial success, rumors were starting to churn with fans of the beginning of the end of the band. With the simultaneous release of each original member's solo albums, something that no active group had accomplished at that time, those rumors were fueled even more. Most fans at the time though did not know that KISS was under contract with their label, Casablanca, to produce the albums, with all four solos counting as two complete albums, out of a total of five albums.    Each member's inner-self and creative style showed through each album. Ace's, the number one selling album and only one to furnish a top 40 single with \\"New York Groove\\" which hit #13 on the charts, was a mostly hard-rock extravaganza, Paul's was typical KISS - hard/soft/ballad rock, Peter's showed his love of Jazz and slow ballads, and Gene's... well... Gene's was all over the place both musically and quality wise.    The album starts of well with \\"Radioactive\\". While the lyrics may be a little over simplified, the song in general has a good steady, somewhat hard rock beat to it. With a few exceptions though, such as the 1960esque \\"See You Tonight\\", \\"Man of a 1000 Faces\\" and it's Orchestral sound, and \\"See You In Your Dreams\\", another lyrically short but good hard rocker, the album slides into the abyss rapidly. A musically star-studded cast does not help this production recover. The bottom of the well is reached with Gene's cover of Walt Disney's \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". Many have severely panned the inclusion of the song over the years. My problem is not in fact that Gene did a cover of a Disney song, but that the vocals are terrible. I mean really terrible. It actually sounds as if Gene is gargling with gravel in his mouth.    If you are a severe Gene Simmons fan, you will more then probably like this album, as it shows the man behind the mask. If you are a KISS fan, there are much better albums/solos out there to enjoy. As I said above, there are probably four descent songs on this album. Unfortunately, four songs do not make an album.    Would I recommend this to a friend? A friend probably wouldn't ask.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|So I am probably not you're average Paramore demographic being a 27 year old man but I have to tell you that I am very Impressed by Paramore and their growth displayed on the new album \\"Brand New Eyes\\".       The album starts out very strong with standout tracks, \\"Ignorance\\", Brick by boring Brick, Turn it off, and The only exception.  This album may change the Paramore fan base a bit as the band transitions from a pop-punk band with some smash singles, to a rock band with Staying power.  No this album does not have a song like Misery Business or Crushcrushcrush that will garner top 10 radio air play, but it does not by the same token have any weaknesses.  from track 1 to track 11 there is not a song on the cd that I will skip, the album rides smoothly on a long car ride as well as going over well with company.  Overall I highly reccomend this album.

0061719544|5.0|I was never of a fan of The Drew Carey Show, so I discovered Craig Ferguson much later than many people did.  My first exposure to him was in the film I'll Be There, which he directed, cowrote, and starred in (and which he trashes in this book, much to my surprise).  Having seen and loved that film, I was looking forward to watching his talk show, which I've followed since day one.  He seems so much more genuine than any other talk show host.  When you watch him, you're seeing HIM, not a guy reading lame jokes from a Teleprompter.  His book is much the same:  It's a real story of a real person's life, not a slick BS Hollywood \\"tell-all.\\"  Despite the horrific flaws in the way he lived his life for a number of years, his humanity and decency shine through on every page.  I love this book.  When I finished the last page, I was sad because I wanted it to go on and on.    Well done, sir!
0385504225|2.0|In a word: disappointing. In two words: very disappointing.   The book feels contrived, totally implausible and the ending makes no sense at all. After reading it I could not help but ask myself for a few days afterwards: \\"Why did Dan Brown write this?\\" and \\"Was his editor on vacation?\\"
B000002N3J|5.0|instead of releasing another cd of her greatest hits, she gives us a collection of her greatest ballads. i'm soo glad she included \\"this used to be my playground\\", \\"crazy for you\\", and \\"i'll remember\\". i love this cd very much and i find it very special. the cd reminds me of the fall season. these songs have romance, nostalgia, and heartache. something for everyone! for anyone who is a fan of madonna should totally get this cd!!! it's totally worth it!!!<br /><br />1.\\"I Want You\\" (with Massive Attack)-god, knows i feel the same way she does. it sucks when a man doesn't want you anymore and i feel the pain of these lyrics. madonna did a great job with this version. 5/5<br /><br />2. \\"I'll Remember\\" (Theme from With Honors)-this song has great memories that i can \\"remember\\". i love the year 1994. it's a beautiful adult contemporary song. 5/5<br /><br />3. \\"Take a Bow\\"-my all-time favorite songs. it shows madonna's vunerable side. 5/5<br /><br />4. \\"You'll See\\"-it's a sequel to take a bow but this time madonna comes off as a much stronger person who is ready to move on with her life. 5/5<br /><br />5. \\"Crazy for You\\"-one of her most underrated songs and one of the few where she sounds good vocally. i can't understand why this song wasn't so popular back then. 5/5<br /><br />6. \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\"-the saddest, most beautiful songs madonna has ever written!! i cry many times when i hear this song. for people who are emotionally sensitve, listen with caution. i can relate to it alot other than \\"love tried to welcome me\\". 5/5<br /><br />7. \\"Live to Tell\\"-i used to cry alot when hearing this song. it has a very dark and sad atmosphere mood to it. i cried when she sang it live during who's that girl and confessions tour. she looking absoulutely gorgeous in the video. she wasn't wearing a whole lot of acessories and bangles on her. it was just simply madonna who was maturing as an artist. 5/5<br /><br />8.\\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (Remix)-i never knew that this a re-worked version from her song on like a virgin album. she sounds awesome on this version. 5/5<br /><br />9. \\"Something to Remember\\"-it tells a sad tale that she gave up on the man she loved and decided to move on. i love this song. 5/5<br /><br />10. \\"Forbidden Love\\"-one of my favorite songs from the bedtime stories album. i love it and the music. 5/5<br /><br />11. \\"One More Chance\\"-the guitar strumming in the background is beautiful. madonna is at her best when she sings these type of songs. 5/5<br /><br />12. \\"Rain\\"- love it. 5/5<br /><br />13. \\"Oh Father\\"-song from like a prayer album. it was very different from her other previous songs. it sounded almost autobiographical and i love the video. 5/5<br /><br />14. \\"I Want You\\" (Orchestral)-love the orchestral version! 5/5sounds awesome on this version. 5/5    9. \\"Something to Remember\\"-it tells a sad tale that she gave up on the man she loved and decided to move on. i love this song. 5/5    10. \\"Forbidden Love\\"-one of my favorite songs from the bedtime stories album. i love it and the music. 5/5    11. \\"One More Chance\\"-the guitar strumming in the background is beautiful. madonna is at her best when she sings these type of songs. 5/5    12. \\"Rain\\"- love it. 5/5    13. \\"Oh Father\\"-song from like a prayer album. it was very different from her other previous songs. it sounded almost autobiographical and i love the video. 5/5    14. \\"I Want You\\" (Orchestral)-love the orchestral version! 5/5

B002FRNCG0|5.0|Who doesn't like her voice? Pure awesomeness. The songs are decent but the band sounds tired at times. Repeat listens make the tunes catchier and I'm not complaining. Hope they make a boat load of dough on the tour and I can't wait for the next one which *should* be better/astonishing.
1416550534|4.0|This is a great read very entertaining. Kate Morton is an excellent writer. She really knows how to make the story come alive. This is a very suspenseful book full of mystery to the very end. So hold on!
B002HNA95E|5.0|This is the best compilation available from the one and only Madonna. It includes most of her greatest hits in a wonderful digitally remastered format. Although some of her hits are missing such as: True blue, Deeper and Deeper, Rain, Causing a Commotion and others. It still is an excellent compilation. I guess with an artist such as Madonna with a successful career spanning almost three decades, it is impossible to include all of her hits unless a boxed set is released. Thank you Madonna for all the years of inspiration. You are the GREATEST, most original, and hardest working artist ever. PLEASE RELEASE THE BLOND AMBITION ON DVD.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Can't really write a review - I'm so stunned by how great this album is. If you are still worried about the band moving on without Layne - give this album a chance.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice In Chains stay true to their roots in \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\". This is an outstanding album.  They have the same sound and style that carved them a place into the rock industry. Layne Staley would be proud. This album starts off strong and it stays consistent from beginning to end. I won't elaborate on every track because I don't want to be repetitive with the terms such as \\"Great\\", \\"Excellent\\", \\"Outstanding\\", etc. Every song has single-potential with strong melodies and beats. This is old-school AIC. I recommend this album to both die-hard fans and new ones as well. Rock/grunge lovers will appreciate this solid effort from one of the greatest bands of all times. GREAT album!!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I am very happy with this GPS but it does have some quirks.<br /><br />I have an Edge 305 on my bicycle so maybe the learning curve was easier for me, but I found the 405CX pretty easy to use. It does take some getting used to but by the 3rd use I had no issues with it. I had my screens set up and was using the simple workouts with ease.<br /><br />The screen is a bit small, but once you get used to the set up it becomes easier to read on the run. If you don't use auto scroll you can quickly look at your watch and get the info you want. At the start of the run I pick the screen that is best for what I am doing and just leave it there mostly unless I get bored and start to cycle through my screens.<br /><br />The touch bezel works ok. Using it to set up a workout is easy once you get used to it. During a run a touch scrolls the screen and a touch and drag increases or decreases the speed of the virtual partner. Sometimes it takes a second or two to register and sometimes a slight touch registers. It's usually not an issue, but sometimes my jacket will make it scroll when I don't want it to. When I do want to scroll it during a run I sometimes have to press a second time to get it to scroll. It's not really an issue for me and you learn the ins and outs of it.<br /><br />GPS reception has been very good for me, even under clothing. It takes about 10-20 seconds to find the satellites each time I run, so I stretch while it's searching. I have noticed that even after it has found the satellites it still needs time to stabilize. For instance on one track run I started running right after it found the satellites in a place with a lot of trees. After the run I looked at my route and the first part of the lap under the tress it showed me about 50' off the track, but on each subsequent lap it showed me right on the track even while under the trees. It just needed time to stabilize. Now I turn on the watch and give it a few minutes while I stretch/warm up, then when I am ready to run it's right on the money.<br /><br />Like the 305 Edge the elevation feature is practically worthless. The barometric pressure just fluctuates too much so the watch is always all over the place. Again it does seem to stabilize the longer it is on, but it's never exact enough to rely on. If you look at the elevation chart in the software after a run you can see where the hills are, but if you are doing laps a hill's elevation can change by as my as 75' each time you come across it. I don't use the watch itself to tell me the elevation when running since it is so off.<br /><br />Looking at the pace chart in the software after a run is interesting. Like elevation, it's all over the place, spikes everywhere. Even though it looks a mess it is useable, where you had to stop for traffic or where your interval sprints will be clear in the chart. While running the pace on the watch does seem very accurate. You can quickly see how fast you are going and if you accelerate it shows instantly on the watch. It is probably one of the most useful display items.<br /><br />The heart rate monitor has been perfect, no issues at all. I do use [[ASIN:B000HZD2NU Buh-Bump, Heart Rate Monitor Electrode Cream]] with it which may help.<br /><br />I have to charge the battery once a week (I run 3 days a week). A 30-40 minute run uses about 10% of the battery. Sitting in powersave mode for a day or two is a greater drain on it.<br /><br />I do love this GPS besides the quirks. It's great to quickly and easily set up an interval workout and not have to be on a track or constantly looking at my watch (it makes a very loud beep at the start of each interval which I can hear even on a windy day). It's a great training aid that makes a run more interesting and fun.<br /><br />The software does leave a lot to be desired (Windows Vista 64). The watch links fine, I have never had any issues there, plug in the ANT antenna and it does everything itself. But the Garmin Connect website while nice doesn't break down everything enough and can be a bit slow. The Garmin Training Center software displays more information but is clunky and not very polished.<br /><br />I highly recommend this GPS watch. It has helped me tremendously on my workouts and makes my runs more fun. While it could be better, and cheaper, I don't regret buying it. I do wish Garmin would improve the software though. For this price they really could do better. I wouldn't let that stop me and there is other software you can buy that works with the watch.enter software displays more information but is clunky and not very polished.

0143034901|5.0|Wow, this book exceeded all my expectations! I haven't loved books by Marquez  and sometimes Umberto Eco leaves me cold, (though his writing especially in Italian is beautiful)so all the comparisons worried me. But Shadow of the Wind reminded me more of Collins and even Anne Radcliffe's the Italian.  It has a rather simple story, I actually guessed the \\"secret\\" early on, but that didn't diminish my interest one bit.  The story is extremely funny one minute and drives you to tears the next (very Latin...). His characters are all extremely well drawn, Fermin is a masterpiece, but the lesser characters like Penelope's mother are just as insightful. The damage of politics in the lives of common people, in this case fascism and war, is also central to the story. Ultimately, love and compassion lead to redemption and conquer the tidal wave of outside forces that derail and try to destroy our lives.  I just never wanted to put this book down! I'm going out today to buy a copy of Angel's Game..hopefully there will be more translations of Zafon's work coming soon!

0385504225|5.0|I bought it, started reading it, and couldn't put it down until 4:30 this morning.  For my 8:00AM English literature class, I went into non-stop praise mode.  This is the best of all Dan's novels so far.  It is in high epistemology mode all the way through and his character Langdon is the perfect foil for the novelist to teach people what words actually mean, what actions happen when a reaction is triggered (and not vice versa), and what some organizations are really all about. If my father, a 33degree Mason were alive to read this, he would not be happy because just a few too many things are revealed that are best left \\"unrevealed\\" about the Lodge.  But overall, a fast paced, thinking person's novel...and Dan has made a whole new set of fans with this novel, and a whole new set of enemies since the CIA and the NSA are not fans of authors who release codes, code breaking, and reveal organizations within secret organizations. For all of Dan's critics out there, try to remember, this is a novel meant to not only entertain (the movie will be unreal!), but to give knowledge a full-fledged workout for the populace.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|The Good:  Tarantino as usual has put together an awesome collection of tunes.  The man has impeccable taste in music.  This soundtrack is also, to my knowledge, the only place you can get the awesome Jack Nitzsche track \\"The Last Race\\" from the campy 60s flick Village Of The Giants, which is notable for having a giant toga wearing Beau Bridges shimmering.  This track is worth the cost of the CD alone, but....    The Bad:  The track is ruined by engine sounds overlaid from the movie.  Just seems to be on this track, so it makes me think it's there to cover up some imperfections in the source recording.  I hope the excellent surf-rock soundtrack Nitzsche did for Village of the Giants gets a proper release one day.  As of now, this was the best I could find.    The mediocre:  Tarantino's films of late, but hey, ya win some ya lose some.  He's still got a few great movies left in him I think.
0553582038|4.0|After reading the first 3 books and loving them some of the reviews on this very site had me wondering if I really wanted to read the 4th. People talk of missing characters with cliff hangers, character viewpoints they did not want to follow, ect...    Welp thank god I decided I had to read it anyhow, in large it is simply another chapter of one gigantic book that started with Game of Thrones.    For people wondering how bad the storyline really is on leaving all your old favorites behind, I did not find it to be the case for the most part.     You will be missing some key characters, but Dany and Tyrion had pretty much tied up their stories at the end of book 3 for at least a while, in all honesty I did not need to see the aftermath of either's storyline from book 3. Bran is missing, and his story was by no means tied up, it is a huge cliffhanger at the end of book 3 for Bran and I expect some serious reading in book 5 about him because book 4 does not even mention him.     We get alot of Samwell, and book 3 set him up for big happenings. We get alot of Brienne, enough of her to last me a lifetime tbh. We get alot of Cersie, alot of Jamie, two key characters who we had seen through other eyes up until now. We get alot more Iron Islands storyline with them becomming major players, and some big setups on that storyline. We get another huge player rising that should create even more tension and multi-faceted war for the upcomming books such as we had in the early books.    Basically if you look at it book 1 of the series did not have huge amounts of action, it introduced characters and set up things for the wild ride that was book 2 and 3. Most of the action that could be done was done by the end of book 3, the series needed some new blood and some new storylines forming. This book was setup, much like book 1 was, and I expect that books following this one will use that setup much like books 2 and 3 used the setup from book 1.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|The picture quality is fantastic for a film that is over 70 years old, each frame is a joy to behold.  The heart and warmth of this movie shines through, and even though the story is camp nonsense it is accomplished with a knowing affection that was produced by the best the Hollywood system had to offer.  Modern, soulless American action movies aimed at the teen market, could well learn a thing or three about how to make a classic that can stand the test of time.    The Blu-ray disc also has a great many extras, many duplicated from the DVD Two-Disc Special Edition released a few years ago.    Buy this on Blu-ray to add a little class (and fun) to your collection.

I love how this series shows a positive future where mankind finally gets its act together.<br /><br />So I was thrilled to see new life breathed into the series with this new movie.  Sure, it has its flaws, but the good far outweighs the bad.  It has great adventure, comedy, action, etc. everything a fan could want.  I had a hard time at first with the alternate timeline, but we just have to believe that the universe will unfold as it should.  Have faith, fans of Star Trek!

It doesn't make any sense.    I'm guessing Grisham phoned this one in.  I bet it took him a month or so to write, tops.    But, if you can live with a story that, at its core, ultimately doesn't make sense, then it will help you pass a few hours while waiting for a plane.
6305736650|1.0|Humphrey Bogart (Rick) is a master of the outer cold/inner warmth style. Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa) glows in her authentic softness.    In the end, Rick makes the best (right) decisions for the individuals involved, and because of this, their actions are also good for society. This movie really deserves five stars.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Baraka is a breathtaking global tour through 24 countries. This un-narrated film has no main story or plot. Instead, it uses dramatic cinematography to present a series of themes centered around the spirituality of man and nature. The movie is a montage of beautifully photographed scenes, played to a stirring soundtrack of ambient environmental sounds. I can only describe Baraka as visual poetry!<br /><br />The 8k high-def scan from the original 70mm film is absolutely incredible, well worth the time-consuming process. If you own a high-end 1080p display, this blu-ray DVD is an absolute must-have.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|What is there left to say about the Beatles that hasn't already been covered hundreds of times? Probably not much, so how do I approach an attempt to convince you that you need to (absolutely need to) check out at least a few of the newly re-mastered Beatles releases? There are any number of tactics, including those that are personal and those that are psychological, and I'm feeling game enough to try both. From a personal perspective, I presently own 6,748 CD's and/or LPs. That's way more than most people, although I know a few people who are even crazier than I am. When you own that much music, you begin to notice that there are entire sections of your collection that are seldom played, or neglected entirely. To be quite honest, I'd say that nearly half of my collection falls into that category. It's not like I regret owning this peripheral stuff, but I simply have no desire to make time for it. Another 25 or 30% fall into a category where I wish I had the time to get to know them better, but real life makes it difficult, if not impossible, to play this stuff as often as I would like. I will probably die before I get to know these albums well enough to be truly familiar. Another 15% or so consist of records that I refer to reasonably often, and know well enough to discern in advance what I like and don't like about them. That leaves less than 10% - in my case, approximately 600 LP's - that I consider essential to my collection, and even of those, there are very few that I have the time for listening with regularity. The Beatles albums (all of them) sit at the apex of this silly mathematical formula, and represent some of the music that I listen to more than any other. Now that forty years or more has passed since their initial release, and another twenty has passed before anybody attempted to improve them sonically, why would I hesitate to snatch up the re-mastered Beatles collection, especially since the newly improved re-masters are stunning in their clarity and the revelations that they offer?<br /> I wouldn't hesitate, but that's me. So then, why would you? This brings us to the psychological aspect of my argument. Maybe you already own the entire collection, and don't want to shell out money for something you already own. Fair enough, but if you own all of the Beatles albums, then that provides evidence that you are a fan, and if you are a fan, you will not believe the depth and detail that you hear when you play the re-mastered version of \\"Rubber Soul,\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" or any other. As a fan, you are denying yourself access to a drastically improved version of music that you already love, and that is self denial at best, or at worst, masochistic.<br />It is more likely, though, that you are a casual fan. Maybe you like the Beatles and own an album or two, but spend most of your music money on something or someone else. If that's the case, you need to look at the stuff you purchased in the past forty years and ask yourself how relevant it is to you. Do you listen to all of it, or is your ratio of `keepers' similar to mine? I'm willing to bet that the Beatles are among your favorites, too, so why in the world would you not buy a stunningly improved version of an album that you are certain to enjoy for the rest of your life?<br />That leaves the `deniers' and the `indifferent'. If you're indifferent, then you probably don't like music anyway, so I don't need to talk to you because you aren't even reading this. If you are in denial about liking the Beatles, then, psychologically speaking, you are truly a tricky case. If you really believe that the Beatles aren't so great, or that (fill in the blank) is so much better, or maintain some other justification for dismissing music that changed the world and remains as relevant as anything recorded in the 20th century, then two possibilities exist. Maybe you're simply a contrarian, and nothing will convince you, or maybe you never really heard the Beatles as they should be heard. Now is your chance.  A++  Tom Ryanshould be heard. Now is your chance.    A++    Tom Ryan
B002JTMNX2|5.0|What an amazing cd that Foreigner has released that is only exclusively available through your local [...]. Before I talk about \\"Can't Slow Down\\" , I just want to say I was on Foreigners' website the day of the release , and as usual , fans of the band had problem's finding the cd in the store and some of the [...] never even put the cd on the shelf , for they were still in the boxes in the back room. [...]! This is the way you treat a classic band like Foreigner who put's thier musical future in your hands for that this is thier first new music thay have released in 8 years and you treat the band and thier new release like they are step children , pittiful !!!<br />For the review of the new cd aptly titled \\"Can't Slow Down\\" , one word comes to mind , AMAZING !! Sure , Lou Gramm is no longer the lead singer for Foreigner and you can't replace and singer such as Lou , but Kelly Hansen is wonderful. He sings his \\"ass\\" off on this record and my hat goes off to him. The new musicians in Foreigner that leader Mick Jones has assembled are stellar. Foreigner has new life and this cd proves that from start to finish. Just listen to songs like \\"In Pieces\\" , When It Comes To Love\\" , Can't Give Up\\" , \\"Living In A Dream\\" and the title track are definitive Foreigner from the late 70's into the early 80's. This is hands down thier best record since \\"4\\". I love this record and I know everyone else will if you give it a try , you will be blown away !!<br />Welcome back Foreigner , \\"Can't Slow Down\\" is a tremendous record  !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|In the second season The Big Bang Theory gains momentum.  The genius exhibited in the first season is expounded as we get to see our favorite characters and situations fleshed out with increasing hilarity.<br /><br />Leonard's pining for Penny becomes more poignant.  Howard's inappropriate machismo sets up him perfectly for the thrashing he receives from every woman he tries to meet, as well as his hilariously sharp-tongued (but never seen) mother.  Raj tries to assert himself both within the group and apart from his domineering parents, while remaining paralyzed with shyness any time he is around a woman.  Penny's social life is integrated in with the nerds, and in a hilarious turn of events she uses her learned geekiness to protect the guys from a pretty girl who moves into their building and doesn't hesitate to exploit the guys.<br /><br />Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, is a force of nature.  His geeky understanding of the universe may some day earn him a Nobel Prize, but in the meantime he doesn't have the social aptitude to notice when a gay man hits on him.<br /><br />The creative brain-trust, led by Chuck Lorre, recognizes that the comedic potential of Parson's Sheldon is far richer than any interest generated by a love-story arc, between Penny or any of the guys.<br /><br />It was difficult to improve on the essentially perfect first season - but season two is simply funnier.<br /><br />Enjoy.
014241011X|4.0|\\"A real witch is wasily the most dangerous of all living creatures. \\"But, if real witches disguise themselves rather than flying around on broomsticks in pointed hats, how can you tell when you meet one?  Roald Dahl's book The Witches was a wild tale about a boy and his grandma and witches that send them on an adventure. The story starts with the boy living with his parents in England. During Christmas, he travels to Norway to live with his grandma. One day the boy and his parents get into a car crash and his parents do not survive. Based on their wishes, the boy goes to live with his grandma. It's here where the boy encounters his first witch. These witches were not \\"normal\\" as we know them; they wore wigs, have no toes, and their eyes are different than a normal woman. These witches also hate children. When the boy and his grandma decide to take a trip, they encounter these witches at a convention in the same hotel they are staying. The boy hides out in one of their meetings and soon learns that they are all here turn the children of England into mice. The boy hears the plan and the recipe of the poison. Before he could sneak out, the witches catch him and they try out their poison on him. The boy sure enough turns into a mouse. The boy and his grandma have an adventure ahead of them to try and stop these witches from turning all the children into mice.    Dahl sets the stage very well in this book because he puts the reader right in the middle of the action. This book is set in 20th century England so Dahl uses dialogue between the boy and his grandma that pertains to this era. He is very descriptive with his language and paints a vived picture in the minds of his readers.     This books falls into the fantasy genre because it contains magic from the poison and the witches that create it. This story could never happen but it is a good book for children to use their imagination and expand their creativity. This book might be a bit scary for some younger children,but for the most part it is a fun book that can further children's thinking.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book because Dahl gives us a fun story about very interesting characters. Dahl provides an opportunity for children to learn a little about the past through a young boy's adventure because Dahl brings his readers into the action. Even though this story is fictional, it provides a different aspect for children to read. Personally, i love to read about witches and other fictional characters because it provides insight and learning in another aspect than our own. This makes children able to predict and think critically about what might happen and what actually does happen; It provides a chance for creativity.    *Mentioned on his official website, Dahl bases the grandmother character in his own mother.   Dahl also wrote most all of his books in a small hut that was behind his house.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Everyone I know who has seen this show loves it - and all of them approached their first viewing with trepidation. HOW could a show about a group of geeks be funny?<br /><br />It IS.<br /><br />And it's not only funny, but you don't have to know about string theory and quantum mechanics to get every single joke.<br /><br />There is genius here, real genius, but I mean creative comedic genius... not the Einsteinian kind.<br /><br />The cast is absolutely brilliant... I mean at the level of \\"Seinfeld\\" or \\"MASH\\" or \\"Friends\\" or \\"Cosby\\".<br /><br />In his spare time while running Dharma and Greg and creating Two and a Half Men, Chuck Lorre came up with this project, and it is genius.<br /><br />Johnny Galecki, as Leonard, and Jim Parsons, as Sheldon, make the best situation comedy team since Andy and Barney, and I make that comparison deliberately as there are definite similarities.<br /><br />The classic Andy Griffith show was a starring vehicle for Andy, but it was Don Knotts as the unhinged Barney Fife who stole the show on his way to winning three Emmys.<br /><br />Galecki's Leonard is written as more the leading man, but Parson's Sheldon has taken on a life of his own: The Big Bang Comedic Universe revolves around Sheldon.<br /><br />Leonard and Sheldon are Ph.D. physicist roommates.  They work at a University doing cutting edge research.  They are also geeky in the extreme, devoting their spare time to computer gaming and comic books.<br /><br />Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, a pretty blonde waitress, moves across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.  Penny is not exactly academically gifted, although she has great common sense and is far more socially adept than her geek neighbors.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by geek friends: Kunal Nayyar as Rajeesh, a physicist colleague who tries to appease his parents in India (frequently present via laptop webcam), and Simon Helbert as Howard, an engineer who fantasizes himself a great ladies man, but lives with his mother and has a little inferiority complex as all of his friends have Ph.D.s while he has only a Masters from M.I.T.<br /><br />The writing is so sharp you could shave with it.  The comedic timing of this excellent cast would have been right at home on vaudeville stages and sparkles here better than a glass of Dom Perignon.<br /><br />As the characters are developed the jokes become twice as funny.  Leonard, a mere genius, humors roommate Sheldon and at least recognizes that he is not as adept socially as he'd like to be.  Sheldon is a freak - receiving his first Ph.D. from the Heidelberg Institute at age sixteen - but his entire world revolves around his Rain Man obsessive-compulsive idiosyncrasies.  He has no idea of social norms and sexual attractions. He is surprised when he occasionally correctly guesses the mood of acquaintances.<br /><br />Recurring themes occur: Penny not \\"getting\\" the geeks, Raj's inability to speak in front of a woman unless he is drunk, Howard making audacious come-ons to women only to be squashed like a bug.<br /><br />The dialogue crackles with wit:<br />Penny: Sheldon, can I ask you a question?<br />Sheldon: Well I would prefer that you didn't but I won't go so far as to forbid it.<br />Penny: ...Okay, I heard 'yes'.<br /><br />If there is a story-arc it involves Leonard's cautious courtship of Penny, although Sheldon advises him early \\"You have about as much chance of going out with Penny as the Hubble Telescope has of finding that at the center of each black hole there's a little man with a flashlight trying to find the circuit breaker.\\"<br /><br />It's smart and it's funny and if Jim Parsons and Chuck Lorre don't win some winged statues the world is more warped than a bungee cord stretched toward a black hole.hile he has only a Masters from M.I.T.

B0025KVLVA|4.0|I was quite excited when I read that the whole Beatles catalogue would be re-mastered and repacked. My expectations somewhat dropped, as it later emerged that there would be no bonus tracks and that there would be no new mixes equalling the 1999 reissue of \\"Yellow Submarine\\".<br /><br />This (YS) was truly a sublime work which had been undertaken with these numbers. Just compare the acoustic guitar on the title track with the first CD edition. This was really a vast improvement - sonically.<br /><br />To get an idea of how much the sound had improved on these new masterings, I chose to invest in \\"Past Masters\\", partly because it gave an opportunity to assess the sound throughout the Beatles' career, and also on this 2CD edition you get good value for your money.<br /><br />The music itself is, as we know, indisputably outstanding.<br /><br />How does the music sounds now? It sounds fine, of course; also better than the on first CD versions, and yet not markedly better. It does not come close to what was achieved with \\"Yellow Submarine\\" - or \\"Let it Be Naked (03) and \\"Love \\"(06) for that matter. The rather primitive stereo on the original early recordings issues is also retained. I had hoped for marked improvements in this field also.<br /><br />On the plus side the inclusion of an excellent 32-page booklet, with information about the Beatles' career and the various tracks on the CD, must be mentioned<br /><br />I would not say that I am disappointed, perhaps rather a bit frustrated that the opportunity was not taken to really make the definitive versions of these golden songs and recordings.
1603090002|3.0|Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed the first \\"Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" series (and hated the movie) but I found this volume to be a bit dull, and couldn't help detecting a strong whiff of self-satisfaction wafting out of the script. \\"What a clever boy am I!\\" is the constant undercurrent to it all, even though Moore seems to have little new to offer his readers that we haven't seen before, time and again. Plus, the story is so slow-moving and inert -- I found it a chore to get through, particularly the extended \\"musical\\" sequences that are intended as an homage to Brecht and Weill: sheer torture. This was okay, I guess, but personally I found myself frequently bored with most of the book. (Axton)
B00243FQFA|4.0|The best season of the Atlantis series. I recommend especially the following episodes: Search and Rescue; The Shrine;; First Contact; Lost Tribe; and Enemy at the Gate.

Looking forward to seeing the movie the \\"Stargate: Extinction\\", that is in production!

B002KLAL4W|2.0|Pearl Jam is one of the most talented bands on the planet and their catalog includes works that are undeniably part and parcel of modern rock's GOLD STANDARD. For this reason, an album such as Backspacer drives me absolutely crazy. This album is completely incoherent. The band takes absolutely no risks here. There is no unifying artistic theme or purpose. The riffs aren't anything that a guitar student couldn't ply within three months of practice. Simplicity is great - but boring riffs are just that. What is Vedder singing about? It's all cliches and standard rock lyric flotsam. I'm just disappointed. This is a band that has the standing and the credibility to real challenge us all with an album that has varying tempos and beats and lyrical schematics. Most of this record sounds like reworkings of the same song. You look at a band like Radiohead - that has challenged themselves and their listeners with each release - I can only imagine what Pearl Jam would have given us had they chose at some point to climb further up the mountain as opposed to resting on their laurels and giving music listeners marginal, half-baked stuff. If anyone who reads this happens to know the band - tell them for us: On the next record CHALLENGE US, DO SOMETHING CRAZY, DO SOMETHING BIG, THE WORLD NEEDS YOU.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Well first of all I give it 5 stars only because it's a great collection. But I'm not happy at all my 2-cd set came out defective some other people I know have the same problem in the U.S. if you pay close attention to the song MUSIC you can hear some kinda of pop or click that is not supposed too be there at first I though it was my stereo speaker but no it's not I heard it on my headphones and is the cd.... I even compare my old album of music and compare both track and yes the celebration track of the song Music is defective. not only that EROTICA skips towards almost the end of the track and DRESS YOU UP was cut the way it starts from the original it sounds like they press record when the song had alredy start playing not good. and now I don't know why warner bros. won't say something about this I think it's really wrong of them.... I paid money for this and my cd is a mess :( can someone help me get the word out I love madonna since 1984 and can't believe this happen too this collection some people may not hear the defect but if you pay close attention you can notice it.

B002GU5V24|1.0|Seems as though Quality Control slipped on this last Genesis Box Set.  As far as I know a few US fans who have listened to the set have the same problems with  the Seconds Out Discs.    On both Disc 1 and Disc 2 of Seconds out, there is a glitch between Tracks 1 and 2.  Track 1 ends and replays very briefly on track 2. This is more pronounced on disc 2  as the songs starts then silence then starts again, and on disc one you hear the  crowd noise repeat.    Hope Rhino has some replacement copies set to go.    What a bummer.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|There are a few 2009 Beatle remasters that stand out to my ears, With The Beatles, Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper, the new Past Masters, and Revolver, with the beginning count off of Taxman to the dark ending of Tommorrow Never Knows, Revolver packs a punch. The first listen I literally turned completely around and said to myself, oh yea, that's noticeable, and notice you will the clarity in the vocals and harmonies, McCartney's thunderous bass lines, everything sounds secure, intact, and alive, a definite step above the old '87. This UK version of Revolver is a much better compilation than the American version, where as it's the complete opposite with Rubber Soul, the American version is the better, - my favorite Beatles recorded compilation, the American version of Rubber Soul is only available on the Capitol recordings vol. 2, or vinyl, these Capitol recordings sound pretty good too, you get the mono and stereo versions, do the Capitol recordings sound better or as good as the new remasters?  maybe, - the songs on Revolver speak for themselves, featuring two of Harrison's better originals, \\"I Want To Tell You\\", \\"Taxman\\", two of McCartney's best ballads, \\"For No One\\", \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\", Lennon's \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and the experimental \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\", and Ringo is highlighted in the set with his signature, \\"Yellow Submarine\\". REVOLVER, a changing turning point for the Beatles, a recording of great intensity, 1966, then came \\"the mastery\\" of Sgt Pepper.

1597801577|5.0|It is hard to follow up the review by Blue Tyson...it covers the book very well so I will try not to repeat it.   As a reader of SF for many years,it is a rare moment that a book comes along that is shocking in its originality.  This a story set in a bleak world, but a world with hope as the characters struggle to find meaning and a future in this world.This is a world of corporate domination as groups fight for what is left in a decaying world.  But if anything ...this books central core is what it means to be human. That to be human is to make choices you may not like and that these choices define you for who you are.These characters must make those choices and that is what really makes this book great.   Be warned...this book does leave open a possible sequel but this  book in itself is a stand alone story. Major plots are resolved in the end...but there are some questions to be answered.I have a feeling there is more to come.  This an author to watch...the only author that comes close to comparison is Ian McDonald.  This book is a must for all SF fans..enjoy and join me in hopefully a short wait for the next book.

B002KVSJ64|3.0|I am a HUGE BB fan.  I have listened to Saturate, We Are Not Alone, and Phobia for the last X years to no end.  I love every bit of them.    For the hard rock style that BB has shown us in the past, this album just does not measure up.  Tracks 1-3 are great.  However, track 4 makes me want to turn the CD off completely.  It's awful.    The harder songs on this album are pretty good, but there is way too much emo here for me to believe it's a BB CD.  I just don't understand why as bands get older, they feel they have to \\"progress\\", which normally means going away from your core and writing softer music.  It just doesn't make sense to me as BB's first 3 albums were so incredibly solid.    This album is still outstanding - just not up to par with what BB had put out previously.  It was not worth the wait.

1594488916|4.0|Overview<br /><br />Over a 10-year period, John Charles Gilkey stole hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books. The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession is an account of the world of book collectors. It's the story of a man obsessed with acquiring a rare book library at any cost, and the story of a dealer obsessed with stopping collectible book theft. And it's a never-ending story that pulls you into the obsessions, as well.<br /><br />Author<br /><br />\\"Allison Hoover Bartlett's writing has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle Magazine, and other publications, and on [...]. Her original article on John Gilkey was included in The Best American Crime Reporting 2007.\\"<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />I laughed when I saw the title of this book - I knew I'd be able to relate to obsessions! I've just calculated that I've got enough review books lined up to do two book reviews per day over the next 50 days... It's that OCD in me coming out. I love the idea of lining all my walls with books; sharing my personality and preferences by putting them on display. And finding a book package in the mail feels like Christmas to me. Fortunately mine is not a costly obsession, though I don't think it would take much to get me into the rare book treasure hunt.<br /><br />And Gilkey's obsession was not supposed to be costly, either, since he acquired most of his books through theft. He had to pay through jail time, but that just seemed to be a part of the acquisition cost, rather than a penalty.<br /><br />I was fascinated to gain insight into the thought-patterns of a book thief. Gilkey saw rare books as a way to gain social status. And he saw theft as being fully justified, as all those crooked dealers were just trying to rake over the consumers. I was also intrigued by his methods of credit card fraud and his downright audacity. And I loved his idea of creating a book theft detective series.<br /><br />The author did a fantastic job in revealing Gilkey's character. I didn't relate quite so well to Ken Sanders, the detective. It's interesting to note how the author was absorbed into the story and became a part of it, rather than remaining an objective observer.<br /><br />A somewhat light-hearted book of the true-crime genre, this is a rare book in its own right...<br /><br />Thanks to Riverhead Books for the review copy of this book.stic job in revealing Gilkey's character.

B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|Works great! I have used it a couple weeks. As an intermediate swimmer for 25 years, I generally have not enjoyed lap swimming in the past, but with this snorkel I find it much more enjoyable. My efficiency and conditioning have definitely benefited. I don't spend so much effort on just getting to my next breath.  With that, you do need to adjust to breathing in your mouth and out your nose, which wasn't a problem for me. It may be for others. In just a couple weeks I have also greatly improved my mediocre technique. Only once on the first day did I get water backing into the snorkel, my bad. (I understand the other type of Finis snorkel has a valve that is prone to leakage. This one doesn't have a valve, which isn't really needed, I find.) After a couple sessions with the snorkel I had no problem going back to swimming without the snorkel. o no concern about going 'natural' when needed.    Personally, I happen to have problems with moving my neck due to injury. This snorkel is great for not having to turn my head.   I recommend it! Get out there and swim!

However, I knew one of the ways I could bring my childhood and home with me was by decorating my room with a piece that evokes not only the playful and carefree nature of childhood, but also serves as a deep and penetrating metaphor for the ironic and misogynistic philosophies of many modern house cats. Ever since I was a youngin, I have been tortured by the heartless attitude that house cats have toward me. I felt that I would be lost if I didn't continue to harbor my hatred of these creatures while exploring my collegiate interests and broadening my world view. Hanging this mobile in my dorm room has helped me to become an active global citizen, in my opinion. I have garnered the respect of many of my professors as well as the other students on my floor. I highly suggest that an parent endeavoring to educate and enlighten their child, regardless of age, buy this mobile and hang it directly about their pillow. It is the will of the forest nymphs that all children become enlightened. That is why I have this mobile, and why my parents were willing to pay many dollars to give me a gift that I love. I encourage you to do the same for your own child! You will not regret giving them this one of a kind opportunity.
0385504225|5.0|Having finished this book on my way to DC, I couldn't wait to explore some of the sites mentioned in the book. The Scottish rite 'temple' was amazing to see in a mostly residential area.  Although I will admit that I found the 'bad' character a replica of the one in DaVinci code, and at times felt that Dan Brown was writing a movie instead of a book, I wanted to reread sections upon completion and I found the final 'Word' very inspiring.  I highly recommend!

6304698526|4.0|While the movie it self was great, the DVD had a deep scratch on one side.  The outside package was not damaged but the center spindles that held the DVD in place was broken alowing it to move around and be scratched.  This DVD had Wide screen on one side and standard on the other, only one side was damaged and I was able to watch the movie.

B0021L8UVW|3.0|I'm started to get a bit concerned for lovers of Sci-Fi: Is extreme and gruesome violence the only way for Hollywood to tell a decent story? First District 9, then Gamers, now Pandorum. I'm really tired of having to close my eyes through a good portion of each Sci-Fi film I watch. Three Sci-Fi movies in a row is the beginning of a trend, and an annoying one at that!<br /><br />On the plus side: The will to survive is palpable in Pandorum. As is the drive to never give-up, absolutely, no matter, what! Despite every conceivable obstacle, our hero's fight to the bitter end to accomplish the impossible. On one level this story is about finding allies and displaying the ultimate courage a human being is capable expressing. The only reason why Pandorum gets 3 stars instead of zero! If you're timing with closing your eyes is as good as mine, you might even leave the theater thanking whatever deity you worship for being reminded of the existence of people in the real world who are like the heroes in Pandorum!<br /><br />For much more interesting Science Fiction see::[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]

B0029LHW4U|3.0|Laynes vocals could turn the blood in your veins cold and send chills to your bones.  Duvall just cant bring the pain through his vocals.  Jerry Should have taken over vocals! I saw Alice in Chains live in Denver at the ogden theater in 2007.  They played an acoustic show and it was fantastic.  Unbelievable show.  This album doesn't represent the AIC that I love.  However I will continue to see them live whenver possible.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|`Man on Wire' is a documentary about Phillipe Petit's shocking 1974 high wire walk between the Twin Towers.  The movie starts with a short history of his previous high wire capers, which included spanning the towers of Notre Dame and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (thankfully well-documented by his crew) , and, briefly, Petit's telling of how his dream of crossing the Towers came about in a dentist's waiting room.  Most of the movie, however, deals with the logistics of his most famous crossing, which included months of casing the Towers (where was the security?), lots of practice wire-walking with simulated high winds (his friends yanking and pulling on his practice wire), and, finally, the recruitment of a few Americans, who the French didn't trust, though they seemed to be critical to pulling the project off.      There was a point about 2/3 of the way through where the pace of the movie slowed somewhat, perhaps purposely done, when the team began to feel they would never pull it off.  This was somewhat enhanced by the natural impatience I had knowing what would happen and wanting to get to it.  But for the most part, Petit keeps the narrative moving ahead full-steam with his natural, animated gift for storytelling.  Other participants, especially Petit's girlfriend and best friend at the time, build-up the emotional aspect of what was to happen.  Still, when the main event finally happens to Satie's beautiful Gymnopedies No 3, the rest of the movie fades away and you are left with something so breathtaking you cannot remove your eyes from the film.  The hair on the back of my neck stood up while I watched these scenes, both from on-coming vertigo (especially from scenes of him lying on the wire, or leaning on one knee) and his girlfriend's beautiful description of the event.  There are pictures of him from the ground where he is a tiny speck to the on-lookers, and pictures of him from the roof where you can read his face: fully focused on his performance, or grinningat the approaching police.  All of them are awesome in their own way, and remind us of the importance of perspective in art.      And that is exactly what this was: art.  Some viewers will get that, others will see it as just a publicity stunt .  Others still will miss the emotions, but still appreciate it for the fascinating act it was.  Some reviewers have mentioned the sad aspects of the story.  Good art, no matter how outwardly joyous, will have strains of melancholy.  It seems sad that friendships went by the wayside after this, but what were they to do for an encore?  What does one do when they achieve their life's dream just shy of their 25th birthday?
B000001E18|3.0|U2 take their new obessions with European music and lyrical irony to the extreme in 'Zooropa', a far more radical departure from their old-school sound than 'Achtung Baby' ever was. Seemingly designed to resemble a broadcast from ZooTV, complete with \\"ironic\\" advertisements and static, the album is dominated by layers of keyboards, dance beats and studio effects. There is almost nothing that resembles a rock song, and very little that even contains recognisable guitar parts. Originally intended as an EP, U2 quickly wrote enough songs to produce a full-length album. Perhaps that might have been better to stick with the original plan, because 'Zooropa' is an inconsistent album that starts losing momentum in the second half.    The fusion of challenging dance music and satirical themes works best on first four tracks: the epic, anthemic title track, the celebrity obsession 'Babyface', and the two well-known singles 'Numb' and 'Lemon'. These songs just click, showing U2 at their most focussed, and were probably the ones intended for the original EP. 'Stay' is a more straightforward love ballad, albeit one that fits the themes of the album, and is one of U2's most under-rated songs (and one of my personal favourites).     After this, things begin to go awry. Only the closing track 'The Wanderer', a collaboration with Johnny Cash which works better than expected, can hold its own with the first five songs. Ballad 'The First Time' sounds like an out-take from the late 80's, and does not fit at all well on the album. 'Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car' seems to anticipate the problems of 'Pop' by taking a serious, sober song and dressing it up with too much studio trickery. And 'Some Days Are Better Than Others' is the requisite U2 embarassing moment, with some of the most cringeworthy lyrics ever written (\\"some days are slippy/some days are sloppy/some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy\\"???).    'Zooropa' is much less consistent than 'Achtung Baby', and the lack of focus means that some of U2's experiments seem confusing rather than bold. However, like 'The Unforgettable Fire' and 'No Line..', the best songs on this album outweigh the flat spots, and on that level the album is a success.     [3.5 stars]
0385341008|4.0|This book is really refreshing, delightful and charming. Brings to mind the days before email when we communicated with loved ones, family and friends through letters, sharing lives and love which could not be thwarted by distance thanks to the postal service.  The characters are interesting, and endearing. The haunting but strong presence of Elizabeth is noteworthy.<br />Set to a background of the Second World war and German atrocities as experienced by innocent civilians, it remains poignant and touching though not gut clenching and sorrowful like other war novels tend to be. It speaks of the human side of some of the German soldiers, who usually tend to be dismissed as evil and as hideous as their leader. It makes one pause briefly to appreciate the possibility that many of them were not willing parties to , or ever intended to be the evil force clothed in German uniforms as they were believed to be.<br />The letter format of the book makes it seem warm and personal to the reader. I gave this book to my 13 year old daughter to read and she loved it!<br />All in all a book worth picking up on a long weekend, or any other time you could do with a good read.
0385504225|4.0|First off, let me say this book is pretty heavy which is good in a lot of ways.  Heavy books can be useful in many respects including, but not limited to:  smashing flies, holding down stuff in a windy room, building mini Stonehenge replicas, and trapping a pet hermit crab in the corner when vacuuming.    This book has other uses not related to its heaviness.  One particularly useful trait of this book is that is a good coaster for many types of beverages, including but not limited to:  coffee, Crystal Light, juice, and sarsaparilla.  Based upon personal experience I do not recommend this book for holding milk.    Finally, I like this book because it looks very respectable on my new book shelf.  I just bought furniture best described as burnt tangerine in color.  Until I received this book, I hadn't found any literature that matched my new color scheme without unnecessary clash.  This stylish book has now made my shelving the envy of all my friends.    In conclusion, I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  I think this book is the equivalent of a Swiss Army knife in its many uses.  If it were not for the foul milk smell coming from this books interior, I would have given this book five stars.  I hope you have found this review helpful.    Love,    Ty

B00009V7P8|5.0|I keep coming back to this cd. It remains brilliant. Saw Damien in Wash.DC couple years ago. Again, brilliant.  That being said, I saw him as a solo act without Lisa. I wish I could pull her off this cd and listen to DR as I heard him in concert. He is very funny, neither sad nor a depressing git at all.  What has worn on me with this cd is LH. \\"Keen\\" as a noun or verb comes from the Irish Gaelic term \\"caoineadh\\" (to cry) and references to it from the seventh, eighth and twelfth centuries are extensive.\\" After a bit, I want to tell her to shove off, just as apparently DH did shortly before I saw him live. Her keening doesn't wear well at all and it has made me put this cd away for awhile several times.
0307472590|5.0|Un libro misterioso con una maravillosa historia que es dificil de soltar cuando se ha empezado a leer.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  It is a beautiful recreation of the Discovery Album. The only parts I didn't care for were when some of my least favorite songs were portrayed.  But even so, I gained a greater appreciation for the movie and the anime art form.  I didn't know this when I purchased, but there is no talking at all, but it really doesn't take away from the enjoyment.  Interstella 5555 is analogous to an LSD-induced trip through space and time.
0307266303|3.0|I thought this would be a great book about the Tarahumara running tribe, but the book was more about ultra-running and runners, less about the tribe's culture.  The author skips around while trying to narrate his experience of finding the tarahumara tribe and ultimately executing an ultra-marathon with the tribe and a handful of (non-tarahumara) ultra-marathoners.  I found his character descriptions interesting, but there were no photos.  I thought the author should have included at least a couple of shots.  The read was okay, but I found some chapters that break from the story line and go off about certain runners, science ect, to be difficult to get through.  I skimmed the last couple of chapters so that I could at least see what happened at the end.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|That's a really good DVD and also an amazing CD. The only bad thing about is there are just a few videos, I'd like to watch much more. That's good stuff.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|OMG I didn't watch it on TV the 1st run but got the set on DVD to watch at one time and yes it was totally worth it.  This series is possible the best thing on TV.  Don't let this great action packed series pass you by.
0321344758|2.0|I don't know why this 200 page book receives such great reviews.    The quality of writing is nothing to be marvelled at, somewhere around grade 3. The advice is O.K., but after the first 20 pages it feels like this seemingly short and condensed book is dragging on and on.    The chapter on testing is so-so. However it could have been accomplished in 1/3 the space, without the silly examples.  The chapter on usability is way outdated and the present browser zooming makes some of the concepts obsolete. Some advice is useful, but it's buried in words.    From the usability perspective, this book on usability is not very \\"usable\\". The author tries to be funny (and sometimes succeeds) instead of conveying key-points. There are no main concepts or anything that you can take away from some parts of the book, except for a strange chapter titles like \\"Don't throw the baby out with the dishes\\" (which I think are meant to be funny).    For a much better coverage of the importance of testing and rapid prototyping I would actually recommend \\"The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses\\". The book is not really about web-design, but it conveys the need for some of the things that \\"Don't make me think\\" glosses over in a much greater depth. The writing and jokes are also far superior to that of Steve Krug.    For the programmers, CC2 should scratch all the right places to get the curious about the right things. I know it's a \\"bit\\" bigger but you would be a poor programmer if you did not read it anyway.    For designers, a course/book in/on design/typography should be much more useful allocation of their time.    My \\"test\\" of this book determined the following low hanging fruit:  -Low level of writing  -Too much wordiness  -Not enough key-points/solid ideas    In the end I think this is an ok average book, for an average sit-at-home web-designer which will maybe improve your web-site. Sadly it does not leave you with any desire to pursue the subject, and you are left with a few \\"band-aid\\" solutions and no reasonable foundation or ideas of your own.
0385504225|1.0|Most of the reviewers got it right--formulaic and poorly written. It is pretty clear that Brown knows the value of the niche he has occupied and is milking it for what it's worth. Although the Da Vinci Code at least had some interesting elements going for it, even it was only a poor man's version of Eco's \\"Focault's pendulum\\"--so if you really are interested in a thriller in the broader \\"freemasonry-secrets-conspiracy\\" genre that will challenge your intellect and that won't let you leave the story behind (I still love and remember the ending after years, while the Lost Symbol is already gone, and I finished only yesterday), go for Eco.
0385504225|1.0|What a giant disappointment.  No story, boring topic (The History Channel has better info), improbable antogonist, repetitive beyond reason.  A guy gets his hand cut off and doesn't seem to lose any blood, or go into shock or anything...just races around DC and climbs a lot of stairs.  Please.  A \\"mystery thriller\\"?  A note to Tom Hanks (who was miscast to begin with): SKIP IT!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I grew up listening to Michael Jackson.  If you loved the Jackson Five, and songs spanning Michael Jackson's solo career, this is the CD set for you.
B002C6K7NA|3.0|This is a good, solid, Skynyrd album. The good news on this release is that the dueling guitar solos are back on quite a few cuts!   The first 5 trax on the cd are the strongest, but some of the better guitar solos are on the later songs, especially the title track and the album closer.  Lyrically, ever since \\"Red, White & Blue\\" became a hit, the boys are penning more and more patriotic songs, but this release takes it a bit too far.    As far as their recent output goes, I rank this one below \\"Twenty\\", \\"Edge Of Forever\\" & \\"Vicious Cycle\\".  I think \\"Edge Of Forever\\" is the best of the bunch.  Quality material from top to bottom with a bit more of the \\"classic\\" Skynyrd sound on display.  Still, I think fans of the current version of the band will enjoy the album.
B001APM46W|5.0|I am a George Michael fan and own all of his albums, except the oldies.  I already owned a copy of this CD and was replacing it as I lost the original!  Love all songs on this CD, it is one of my favorites.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|With the whole month of December being re-runs because of holiday specials, I kinda forgot what had happened so I didn't watch anymore until the dvd set came out. I was watching it with a friend and we kept saying \\"One more episode\\" and then we would turn off the tv.  The it turned into \\"One more disc\\".  That didn't work either.  We ended up watching the whole season in 3 days.  That is what happened when I bought season 4 as well.  But I ended up watching that in one day.  The show is just as good as it used to be.  Just because some of the characters have changed and matured doesn't mean that the storylines are weak or predictable.  I loved this season just as much as I have loved all the others.
0307474275|4.0|I thought this book, just like \\"Angels and Demons,\\" was very well written.  The only problem I had with it, was the fact that the story seemed to have the same exact set up.  Only thing different was location and what was going on.  Same main character who would think he knew everything, but didn't and needed someone else to help, and every time he thought he got it, oops! He didn't!<br />It also took a while to get me engaged enough to not want to put the book down at the beginning, and near the end I lost interest as well.  Like I said, the similarities between \\"The Davinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" are just too much for my liking.  Think up a continuation, but don't have the same outline and everything.<br />From what I've read about \\"The Secret,\\" it's yet again the same outline and main character, and for that reason it currently has two and a half stars.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars for writing, but lost one to lack of imagination in terms of the story line.
B0015KO52S|5.0|If Jack White is involved, I'm never disappointed: however, Consolers of The Lonely is absolutely awesome. I loved every track. I would say its much better than Broken Boy Soldiers. Can't go wrong with this one.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This will be my holiday gift of choice for so many people who are special to me.  Music can be such a powerful force to bring humanity together around our common needs - and through technology the Playing for Change folks have united musicians around the globe to produce tracks that emanate the synergy of a world united in a beautiful effort.  The DVD is a great little addition and learning about the Foundation's efforts to give back to the countries they visited by building music schools so that local artists can nurture the next generation of musicians inspired me to purchase a few more - in spite of the price going up from the original $9.99 - (could NOT be beat!).  Amazon processing and delivery flawless as I have come to expect -  I am enjoying this CD immensely!!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Another phenomenal Andrew Davies interpretation of Dickens. Just fantastic. Truly one of the finest period productions ever -- and I am a huge fan of Davies and BBC videos.    Others can detail what makes this special -- incredible acting by Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy, sets, costumes, the Davies feel for Dickens, and some fine directing. The plot itself is another a twisted Dickens soap, published as a serial, and semi-autobiographical. After watching the DVD, I grabbed the original Dickens which I had neglected. I did this both because I wanted to read it and also because the ending of the movie is incomprehensible without notes (also easily discoverable online).     Great stuff. Don't miss it.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I don't know that much about mobiles.  I looked at the reviews on Amazon and purchased it based on past customer ratings.  My baby boy seems to like.  The construction seems pretty good.  I would definitely recommend to friends and family.

0740745271|4.0|I'm 35 and from the age of 10 have had to do eye exercises, I have great vision, but intensity at one focal point [ie reading computer screens] can strain the convergence on long distance.    This book really helps, if you gaze long enough a little bit each day, you really feel it set your eyes and inhibit any strain that day to day work can cause. I never knew how effective these images could be.    The eye have it.
B00009ATIX|3.0|Previous reviewers have said about all that needs to be said about the content of the film. Clearly there is a difference of opinion, a sharp difference. While no Sci-Fi buff, I have enjoyed many in the long line of such films that began with the experimental French film at the turn of the century (19th to 20th). However, Solaris is a film in which the science fiction aspects are quite irrelevant. They are used only as a backdrop to a man-woman story that could have been put into any setting with slight adjustment.The story itself might have benefited from a supername on the marque; but, through no fault of George Clooney, his presence does not salvage the lackadaisical script and direction. The actress playing his wife, Natascha McElhone, certainly makes one believe she would be missed, the others were simply playing roles with little definition or opportunity for an actor to shine.
B002POMLHY|5.0|If you liked Phobia you will like this one too.  I loved Phobia and it's love at first listen for Dear Agony too.  Well done. :)
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This is paramores best album to date. The songs are catchy and musically resplendant. Great Job Paramore.
B000NVDMT2|4.0|Starts out lighthearted, then develops into one of the toughest reads I have ever encountered without a grade hanging in the balance.  Pirsig chronicles his self-evaluation and re-living of a descent into madness -- actual mental illness followed by his commitment and eventual state-forced electro-shock therapy.  You have to wonder along the way whether he'll go \\"insane\\" again by this re-evaluation.  You also have to wonder along the way \\"Who Cares?\\" as Pirsig analyzes deep philosophical conundrums that plague him.  But he puts these deep philosophical analyses in everyday context, and convinces himself -- and hopefully the reader -- that these questions should be addressed by everyone.  Worth the trip down the rabbit hole.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I love anything Gary Cooper plays in. This movie is one that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next. It is especially meaningful to our family since we are a military family.
0385504225|1.0|I listened to the unabridged audio version and I must say, this was an excruciating experience, especially the hour and a half AFTER the very predictable climax and denouement had been reached. Other reviewers have pointed out the wearisome repetitiveness and unnecessary summations throughout the book. Except for the method of \\"death/resurrection\\" of one of the characters, the \\"unexpected twists\\" have all been used before in better novels. I have no doubt this will be made into a movie, but predict it will be panned even more than The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Three redeeming features of this book: the insights into Masonry, D.C. architecture, and noetic science. Instead of reading this book, pick one on any of these three topics and you will have spent your time more wisely and enjoyably.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Amazing album! So glad it's out! Alice in Chains ROCKS! Check this album out. :)
1423101472|5.0|This is the fifth, and final book, in this series.  I was excited to read this book and it didn't disappoint.  I actually listened to this on audio book and the audio book was very well done.  This was a great conclusion to the series.<br /><br />In this book Percy and crew head to New York in an attempt to protect Mount Olympus; Kronos is hot on their tails giving our heroes quite the difficult time.  Meanwhile the Olympian gods struggle to contain the titan Typhon as he rampages across the United States.<br /><br />This book was well done and an excellent conclusion to the series.  I love the humor in this series and enjoy all the action as well.  While previous books were more of the questing variety, this book was mainly one huge epic battle between the demi-gods and Kronos.  I personally enjoy reading about heroes questing more than I enjoy epic battles; but that being said, the epic battles were really well done.<br /><br />The whole way that Riordan dealt with the battles, Kronos, etc was excellent.  The pacing of the book was great, never a dull moment.  The heroes make believable decisions and mistakes, as do the villains.  The ending was very satisfying and tied up most of the loose ends.  There were a couple interesting twists to the plot that should keep readers on their toes. Riordan does hint at a future series set in this world at the end of the book.  Whether it will involves Percy or a different group remains to be seen.<br /><br />Anyone who has read the previous books in this series won't be disappointed with the way this is all wrapped up.  Anyone who hasn't read the series should; both adults and kids can really enjoy this series.
0385504225|1.0|Yes Dan Brown can write a pacey, exciting thriller and no he is incapable of balanced, fair writing. He clearly favours the masons with their diabolical, fear filled rituals and appears to even agree with their obsession with fear, death and violence claiming it helps them to appreciate life! Utter nonsense. Apparently meditating on skulls and bones in a dark room filled with sulphur (black magic associations with killing enemies) beneath the White house  while contemplating war, helps the masonic politician appreciate life!    It appears to be okay to poke fun at the easy target Catholics in two of his other books, but he treads far too carefully with the masons, seemingly terrified that they will covertly ruin his career? and even ... knobble him?    Despite his detailed attempted revelation of the meaning of many masonic symbols he fails to elucidate the most obvious masonic symbol, namely the square. On the one hand he depicts the masons as privy to the hallowed secrets of life, and yet fails to tell the reader that the masons are obsessed with the 'square' because they believed the world and the universe were flat and shaped like a square! Genius masons eh!    Brown comes across as a new boy at school desperately trying to lick the ar**** of the bigger boys to stay in the inner `club'. Sad and pathetic.
B001EO748M|4.0|I took a number of history classes back when I was in HS in the 1950s. As I recall from my history books, though they were mere overviews of the period, what I saw depicted in the Tudor series was a lot as I remembered it. The actors did a fine job depicting their characters and I was more than pleased with my purchase. I look forward to getting more on the series. Reminiscent of the movie \\"Becket\\" and the torrid performances of both O'Toole and Burton. You cannot go wrong with this Showtime series if you love English history and fine acting.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I watch A LOT of TV and I can honestly say there has never been a show that was so riveting and so gripping from beginning to end as Breaking Bad. This show is a masterpiece through and through.    During the first season, we come to see how Bryan Cranston's character (acted brilliantly, by the way) could not be any more desperate. And just when you think things couldn't get more low, in comes season two with more problems and more desperation.    I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this season, but my God, if you haven't seen it, get this DVD collection it will be so worth your time.
0439023491|5.0|I became a huge fan of Suzanne Collins after reading her Gregor the Overlander series. After reading Hunger Games, I was immediately drawn into the world Collins created. I read the book in its entirety in one sitting. I felt the same way while reading Catching Fire. Collins is such a skillful and talented writer, in that she provides an escape from the real world and into her own. Catching Fire captures your heart and makes you linger in anticipation for the final installment. My friends and I had many long discussions of our theories for the next book. I can't wait!!!
B00008MJ8H|5.0|I received this cd in excellent time!  The music is as haunting as   I remembered it in the movie.  Thank you for your quick response.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I'm happy to be one of the few who didn't care for this movie.  Every few seconds a limb is sliced and BLOOD sprays everywhere.  I don't care to watch that.  People with swords flying through the air?  One swordsman (woman) defeats an army of 30 trained swordsman in less than a minute?  Characters are shallow and have no grounding to reality.  I can keep going, but It'll just bore ya...  I guess my taste in movies has improved since the days of Pulp Fiction.  I'll still take Jackie Brown over Kill Bill anytime.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code had plots that developed quickly and featured location, location, location. One can forgive and even ignore inaccuracies (artistic, historical, religious...) for the sake of a good read - which is why The Lost Symbol, for me, was so very disappointing. Over-researched, plodding, condescendng, predictable: as if these flaws were not sufficient to encourage my moving on to the next Kindle download, there is the huge problem of feeling &#34;had.&#34; Mr. Brown begins his story with a (surprise!) highly questionable premise, which he attempts to support by throwing every &#34;fact&#34; he researched at his readers. I was bored with this latest effort and will just watch Tom Hanks in The DaVinci Code again rather than make a trip to D.C. in search of symbols.
B001O5SXRC|1.0|I like Jeff bridges and read the movie description on the back at Blockbuster and thought it would be a good conspiracy movie. The plot has many twists and turns. Jeff Bridges plays a collage professor who teaches a course on the history of American terrorism and begins investigating a neighbor he suspects of belonging to a right wing terrorist organization. The professor surprisingly shows how federal agents botched a raid on a family (Parsons family) it wrongly suspected of being part of a right wing terrorist group who were innocent resulting in the deaths of Parsons's wife and youngest son. He also mistakingly describes the Oklahoma bomber's attack on the federal building as using C 4 explosives rather than fertilizer which was actually used. The professor's suspicions of his neighbor were laid arrest for a while until his girlfriend was murdered by the right wing terrorist organization. The ending was meant to appease left wing extremist paranoia and convince the general public that there is a vast right wing terrorist conspiracy which cannot be uncovered by our government
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Lots of interesting stories within the story. I had never heard anything about this Dickens tale, but it is one of my favorites now! Can't wait to watch it again!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I have found Dan Brown to be generally an  entertaining author and was looking forward to this new novel.  His attention to detail and basing his stories on factual organizations usually just fascinates me.   The Lost Symbol however lost me.  It left me feeling like I missed something in the story even while learning things about our nations capitol that I have never would have known otherwise.  Angels and Demons or DaVinci Code it was not.
0385342020|4.0|This book had a refreshing twist--a ghost who helps Lara dump her boyfriend, get Mr. Right, mimic a psychic, and get revenge! Wish I had one to give me a little help.    Just a few things I wish were different. Lara's sister Tonya is a total [...] and her character doesn't improve at the end, which disappointed me. Tonya also doesn't have much to do in the book, so why was she even in it? Even spoiled Diamanté, Lara's cousin, has some redeeming qualities at the end.    And the whole plot of the book is the search for the necklace. I was hoping it would end up either around Lara's neck as a gift from Sadie, or else displayed next to the painting in the gallery. I was so disappointed that the necklace got cremated...Ugh!
B002JM1VJG|1.0|I too was excited about this collection being released.  However, the quality is terrible!  I have a 46\\" Sony LCD and play it in my PS3.  The videos look worse than a VHS copy.  Also, the censorship is appalling.  I can't believe that Madonna would have approved this.  You can download an uncensored version of JML on iTunes.  They have 2 videos; make sure you get the one that was released on 1/03/2006, 5:00 long and 65.6 MB.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I have been listening to the Incident in the past two weeks as PT album always requires you to listen many times..before you can make up your mind.    The Incident is my second PT's favorite album after In Absentia. After In Absentia, I was somewhat disappointed with Deadwing and even more with FOBP.   Both Deadwing and FOBP were getting more mainstream and lacking the cohesiveness that I am looking for in an album. Anesthetize (FOBP) is epic, the rest of songs are somewhat forgetable.   Admittedly, it is hard to top In Absentia. It is pure genius from every way you look at it.    I will let somebody else to disect each songs separately. I listen to the album as a whole..with every listening session, I never feel fatigue.   It left me wanting to listen more and more, before I know it, I am on the last song.    Here is me nickpicking:  1. The transition between \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"Kneel and Disconnect\\" could be smoother...  When I listen at this part, I feel like I got disrupted from my listening.  2. The solos are forgetable..I wish Stephen Wilson put more effort into them.  3. Time Flies, from nice intro, going to Am (just based on my hearing...I did not check it with my guitar) around 1:30.. I feel it could be done better.  4. The ending is anti climatic...I wish it ends in stronger note, just like how it started.    Overall, it is really solid album from PT, 5 star from me.
B002JTMNX2|5.0|Mick Jones has assembled a great version of Foreigner for this release and Kelly Hanson is a great fit, vocally, for Foreigner.  This is what I expected from a new Foreigner CD and more.  Lou Gramm is an amazing singer but I really always like his more rocking songs.  The songs on this CD are all very good and mostly up-tempo.  Kelly Hanson has a great voice and I love him as a replacement for Lou Gramm.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|My review and discussion is extremely brief. I have read all of Dan Brown's books. Most were entertaining. This book was simply poorly written, badly edited, cookie cutter characters, and probably worst of all: BORING! I should have stopped half way through and pitched in the trash, but I finished it so see if there was any redeeming quality that would appear late in this dull, repetitive, BORING, book that actually makes videos of Masonic rituals appear to be a possible national security threat. Please. What foolishness. When I am three quarters of the way through a book and the characterization is so thin I can't visualize anyone, or suspend belief at any point, that is a really bad book. I am not that hard to satisfy or entertain. Save your money.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|This new Skynyrd CD is simply amazing.  It has a heavier sound but the songs are still crafted in the southern rock style.  Lyrically, it is what you would expect from Lynyrd Skynyrd but the updated sound makes this one of their best in a while.
B001EI5CA0|5.0|Great CD... Its my favorite for those cold winter days sitting by the fire watching it snow outside, or simply falling asleep to. Most of Enya's music has been very calming and relaxing, and very therapeutic, and this is just another great addition to my collection.
B002FRNCG0|2.0|1st off let me say I am a Paramore fan, for sure. That's why its difficult for me to say this album is just plain not good. I listened to it about 6 times in a row and can truly say that I only got into 2 songs...Careful and Ignorance.  And I find that even more saddening cause Ignorance is so reminiscent of Misery Business for me that I can take it or leave it...cause lets face it Misery Business was the end all, be all.<br /><br />Just because I don't like this album does not mean Im turning my back on the group cause they are truly talented and deserve the accolades they receive( Try to see a live show...amazing). However I can honestly say I wont be recommending this Paramore album to friends as I did with the last few and will simply bide my time til the next album comes out and, hopefully, blows me away.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|after waiting for the item to arrive it didn't work. I sent it back and I was promptly refunded the costs. However, I still couldn't use my vinyls, so I went to radio shack and bought another brand that did work.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|i started reading Terry Goodkind's SWORD OF TRUTH series recently. i decided the show sounded cool, too.  i was in for a big disapointment. the show was nothing like what i expected. the special effects are great, the acting is pretty good, but when you get right down to it, LEGEND OF THE SEEKER is just kind of so-so. the storyline is handled clumsily, without the slightest hint of subtlety (is that spelled right?). it could be considered \\"good\\" by those who are not familiar with the books, but i remain unimpressed. they removed a lot of key plot elements, such as peoples' fear of the confessors, and the way they introduce some of the characters (ie the Sisters of the Light) is completely random and a little bit hokey.  overall, though, i htink its not that great because SWORD OF TRUTH just doesn't have much potential in film or TV. the plot is too intricate, many of the themes and morals are too subtle, and the scope and scale of the series is just too massive. even if someone managed to pull off the necessary miracles to make a good SWORD OF TRUTH film (the way Peter Jackson did with LORD OF THE RINGS), you still have to face the fact that the story itself is very deep and very mature, more so than any book i've ever read, and most people would be just too damn dumb to understand it.    in short, it's okay, a little bit painful for fans of the books, but i don't think it will be able to make it and still maintain integrity to the books.   also i think the interperetation of the Mriswith in season two sucks horse balls. seriously. its beyond terrible.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Aside from all the arguements such as \\"It's not AIC without Layne!\\" \\"Well Jerry wrote 80% of the material\\" blah blah blah... Who cares? They chose to call it AIC, it's their decision and it's lame to argue over what a band should rightfully be able to call themselves.  Either way, I feel it's a strong album.  It's not Dirt, but what is?  It's a different time and a different place, and I for one have very little to look forward these days in rock music, and AIC's return is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />It sounds like classic chains, with the slow, sludgy, grinding riffs like All Secrets Known, A Looking in View, Acid Bubble, and Take Her Out, along with more SAP/Jar of Flies style tunes like Your Decision and When the Sun Rose Up again.  The eerie vocal harmonization is in full effect, in fact I'd go so far as to say there's not really a lead singer as 3/4 of the singing is all harmonies and I have trouble telling them apart sometimes.  I honestly would have like to heard Duvall a bit more, I feel he is given a chance to show some identity, which I think he is fully capable of showing.  Perhaps they were a little reserved about letting him sing more lead because of a negative reception of him \\"replacing\\" Layne ?  Either way, I really like his voice.  Layne is one of the greats, and few can measure up, but he's gone.  And Duvall sounds great and is just playing and making good music with the rest of the guys, and not trying to overcompensate or be Layne, so what's the point of arguing in comparison?<br /><br />A lot of people won't like this album because they have a pre-conceived notion about it, but anyone doesn't enjoy it simply because they don't like the tunes, then I think that's perfectly fine, it's not for everyone.  Just listen with an open mind and think about where these guys are in their lives, and all the crap that's plaguing rock and alternative stations with generic rock voices trying to write catchy singable chorus' with no real meaning (if I have to hear another crappy generic band that sounds like Seether or Three Days Grace I'm going to shoot myself).  AIC is a quality band and make quality music.  There are a few lyric choices I'm not the most impressed with... \\"tears in my bong\\" or something like that, and \\"check my brain\\", but overall I'm digging it.  And musically, it's haunting, beautiful, dark and heavy which is what I come to expect from an AIC record, regardless if Layne is there or not.  Comparing records and bands saying one is better than the other to me is a waste of time.  Dirt will always be their classic, and Jar of Flies will always be the showcase for their diversity (and SAP too I suppose).  But in the end Black Gives Way to Blue has some great tunes, I'm not in love with all of them, but I can say the same about some of the other albums, even Dirt.  Personally, my absolute favorite is When the Sun Rose again, just a beautiful song with this haunting guitar that really just hits home for me the vibe of what AIC has been through and you can really feel the emotion on this record, along with some fun as well!<br /><br />I'm just glad their back, making genuine music, moving on and doing what they love, regardless if they like the new music or what the bands called, the real fans should feel the same way.er crappy generic band that sounds like Seether or Three Days Grace I'm going to shoot myself).

B002HNA95E|4.0|The collection is decent, I def would've swapped a few songs out for others but overall its ok. The remastering to the older tracks is nice but some of the edits of the songs are weird, like \\"4 Minutes\\" for example.
B000AOEMXM|2.0|I love the series, but the transfer to DVD is poor.  It compares poorly to a regular DVD movie, and also to the quality you will see on HDNET, where I first started watching the series.  This tells me the source material is OK but the transfer is sloppy.  I think this series was originally shot on film, which means this could be extremely crisp.  On the first episode I could see major halos around the uniforms in the scene where Archer was talking Hoshi into coming on the trip while she was in South America.  There is a lot of grain and fuzinees to the picture.  This has nothing to do with the limitations of the media.  It's just a quick and dirty transfer to DVD.    What a waste.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Now as a hardcore Madonna fan I've been waiting for this to come out and i was very excited... till i played it. The other reviewers are 100% correct, the picture quality is not very good at all, and im playing it on a ps3 upscaled to 1080p coupled with a sony 40\\" 1080p tv. The \\"5.1\\" mix is decent id say, it adds a bit more bass to the subwoofer i think. Some of the choices in the tracklisting are ridiculous to me, for example \\"whos that girl\\" and \\"crazy for you\\", i could've really done without the fuzzy bad 80's videos but whatever. overall id give it a C- on picture quality and a A for sound.  ps whats with the newly cencored justify my love video?? lol
B0012GMXLU|5.0|Great riffs, great lyrics and their most ambitious album.  Every song, in its own way, is great.  Essential to any Motorhead fan's collection and a great place to start for beginners.
B00247RVGS|5.0|One of the most original movies that I've seen in a long time.  This is not your typical \\"Hollywood\\" movie.  You will not be able to figure out who the bad or good guy is, or figure out what will happen in the end (only if you've already been told.)    Please watch this movie \\"WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS\\".  Every second of the story line is \\"linked\\" and even if you do not realize it, you will see that everything & everyone is connected & everything will reveal itself to you even after the movie has ended (it has a lasting effect).      You will live through the life of the main character & also many of the supporting characters.  You will have happy, mad & sad feelings for all of them.      In the end, you will be suprised (you decide positively or negatively) but you will not have wasted your time viewing this.    Two Thumbs All the way up :-)
B002M5ZCEU|4.0|I think this is the best contemprary album she's done since she's married Bobby Brown, or since the bodyguard. I enjoyed this album alot more then My love is your love. I think she's not trying too hard to be contemprary. Which is something that i intially feared from her. ANyway, I was excited to The single I didnt know my own strength on the radio. The dj from the rnb station from st. louis had flown to New York to preview the album. I was like wow, thats a great way to hype up an album and have dj's play it. At first i wasn't into the track, but it quickly grew on me. My problem with that single was the fact that it sounded like it could have been done in 1992, instead of 2009. And when whitney relieved that it had been written 10 years earlier. I was like wow, I hope she has something thats more current then this song or else she's not gonna chart high. I was glad to be wrong. Most of the tracks sound contemprary, and good. Grant it she def. can't sing like she used to. But the production quality on the album made up for it. Nothin but love is my favorite track. I love the80's inspired how will know feel to it.I also loved Salute. I thought that was a pretty cool track. Million Dollar bill was neat because it showed whitney in a funky disco way.It was def. something i never heard before. I thought alicia keys and swizz beats did an excellent job producing it. Call to you was a pretty catchy track as well. Overall, i enjoyed this album better then her previous 2, and i think it's her strongest album since the bodyguard soundtrack.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|The idea of Practice, Self-Motivation and a skilled Mentor is an age old formula that is updated nicely in this book. In that respect, this is a great book.    The one thing that I FULLY disagree with is the author's ignoring of inborn talent. There ARE people who are simply born with a raw talent for musical pitches, colors/painting/drawing, physical skills, etc. Example-Mozart had a inborn sense of pitch that allowed him to hear music deeper than 99.9% of the population. If you take two people who do the \\"Deep Practice\\" for 10,000 hours and one has a higher level of latent ability(read:Talent) than the other, the one with the higher latent ability will be better.     Not saying that people can't do well and be highly skilled if they set their mind to it mind you. There will just ALWAYS be that very upper level that those of inborn talent will reach(assuming the practice and dedication) that those without it will not.

B0027BOL4G|1.0|I found it fairly hard to sit through this entire movie. Yes, food contamination, unhealthiness, and conglomeration is depressing. But, has it already been covered? Yes.     Most of the content in the movie has already been reported by Schlosser. If you have read Fast Food Nation, there is not much need to watch this movie. Talk on fast food restaurants? Check. The link between obesity and unhealthy food? Check. Slaughterhouses and migrant workers? Check.    A lot of the movie topics have been covered by other documentaries, such as King Corn and Super Size Me. The parts that haven't appeared in other documentaries, such as the death of a young child who ate at Jack in the Box, make up a small minority of the film. There are countless scenes of farmers complaining about the meat packaging and farming system on their farms, which, while interesting, are drawn out to the point that they turn repetitive.     Overall, if you have read Fast Food Nation and loosely keep up with current events, there is not much need for you to watch this film that tells you so much of what you already know. Don't be fooled by the flashy trailer (a.k.a. the movie's opening sequence) into watching this rather unimpressive film.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|My niece suggested the film as she knows I get into vampires, but I've got to admit I've never seen one like this.  I can't say I enjoyed it, but I also can't say I didn't.  It was disturbing to see a child vampire as a lead character.  The relationship between the boy and the girl was endearing if not a little discomforting.  After viewing the film I gave it to my niece who really, really likes it.

0385504225|2.0|So Langdon shows up at the scene of a vicious crime.  Surprise Surprise.  Langdon is under suspicion.  wow, there's a shocker.  Langdon is whisked away moments before an impending arrest by a stranger.  Hey, wait a sec.. didn't this happen once or twice before??  Then Langdon must use his unbelievable skills to prove he's as clueless as he claims about the crime, and solve the riddle before something terrible happens.  Ahh yes, sounds familiar now, doesn't it?    Look, Mr. Brown, you had a good thing going.  You just should not have tried to write the same book over again by giving it a new title, and a new setting.  The so-called devastating event that everyone is afraid of, really is NOT very devastating.  And the criminal that's been created isn't very believable (sort of freaky, in a Halloween-costume-gone-bad sort of way).  And why was the woman's research being targeted?  Did that fit in well at all with the rest of the story?  I didn't think so.  I got the point that her research and testing was tied in nicely with her brother's dilemma, but did it need to be targeted and destroyed?  Or did Mr. Brown just need to fill some pages and create a faux suspense to make the reader think that this story was going to be REALLY exciting?    All in all, the message is interesting.  The last two or three chapters were very thought provoking.  But it should have been a documentary on PBS or Discovery (as I'm sure it will be soon).  It should not have been the catalyst for another Langdon \\"save the world\\" book.  Wish I had my $[...] bucks back.  If there were a Cliff Notes version, that would be all anyone would need.  Do they still make those?
1594481717|5.0|Just finished Pink's book \\"A Whole New Mind\\"!  As a parent of 4 kids - 2 in college, 1 in 8th grade, and 1 in 4th grade (yes we finally figured out what causes it;-) - we are VERY intrigued by the seachange that Pink describes is occuring in the workforce and our world culture.  I just found out that our local school board is now required to read \\"A Whole New Mind\\", a mandate from our newly appointed Superintendant.  And so the dialog is beginning at our local grassroots level to embrace the paridigmatic shifts that Pink so elequently articulates in \\"A Whole New Mind\\".    Thanks Daniel for writing down your keen observations on these 21st century cultural shifts!!  Now its time to challenge my own kids' right brains!  JY
0385504225|2.0|That's the message of The Lost Symbol, and you're better off taking Dan Brown's advice than reading his hardly worthwhile novel with its disapointing reveals.    The plot amounts to a sicko Freemason taking on the CIA in a race to find legendary ancient secrets hidden somewhere in Washington D.C., Robert Langdon leading the way in an attempt to save his captive mentor.    This being my introduction to Dan Brown mania (I've never read one of his books before), I was shocked by the shoddiness of the writing coming from a megaseller. I can't remember meeting characters with this level of niavete. They are ready to believe every phone call, text message, and disguise used by the manipulative villian. The thrill is gone when all you can do is feel sorry for the disendowed protagonists. The writing is also jarringly repetitious. The same descriptions and plot points are reiterated by one character after another. The facts and figures accumulated from Brown's long years of research predating this book show up in paragraphs that break any flow of suspence, and stimulated my mind only to the extent that I wondered how much was real and how much was embellished.    Brown also needs to understand that stating something happened from one persons point of view and later stating it happened another way from a different point of view feels more like a cheat than a plot twist. Its just misleading and doesn't amount to a satisfying pay-off.    As it is a follow up to the The Da Vinci Code, the merit of which I can not vouch for, The Lost Symbol will sell well. That must testify to success of Da Vinci at least creating a desire for more Dan Brown. Unfortunately, The Lost Symbol does not satiate.
0143113100|5.0|I bought this book after reading the first few pages. I was hooked. I'm a believer in human abilities and the potential for growth beyond what we perceive. This book goes on the idea that human brain potential is relatively so vast that our capabilities to heal and grow are still unknown. The brain is such a complex machine. Its a miracle. The book has a lot of clinical data and detail into the individual studies performed, so if you like detail, you'll like this book. It also has areas that discuss and speculate on  potential and it really makes you sit back and think... WE CAN DO ANYTHING. I loved it.
0385504225|1.0|And I've read some dogs!  Let me preface this by saying I am a librarian who buys the fiction for a middle sized library and because I knew there would be high demand purchased 50 copies of this book. I should have known better. It is perhaps the most boring book I have ever read, endless prattle about the mysterious \\"word\\", a climax coming at least 40 pages before the end of the book, preachiness to the extreme, and repetition repetition, repetition! When I see the many well written page-turning thrillers that exist and that are bypassed in favor of Mr. Brown's books, I want to scream...but unfortunately that is not allowed in the library.    And as for the one star rating. Evidently Amazon does not accept ratings with \\"No Stars.\\"
B001TODCII|1.0|See that French quote I used for my review title?  Cutting and pasting that into a google search will bring you more pleasure than this movie will.  All I can ask is WHY did Neeson ever agree to star in this one??  Did his Schindler's List money run out already?  This type of nonsense is better left to the governor of California for heavens sake.  The first twenty minutes serve to \\"develop the charactors\\" then it's shoot this, break that, fly threw this, jump on that, swing from this rope and mimic spiderman.  I felt like I was watching a video game of twenty bad guys attacking the good guy with their fists up and mouths open just waiting to get bashed.  I honestly feel a little dumber after having watched it.  Who is really going to pay $350,000 for that girl anyway??  And why wouldn't the fat guy at the end just give her back instead of putting up a fight.  You know, like say \\"sorry I didn't know she was your daughter, here you go pal.\\"  Silly silly silly.  Adios

0439023491|5.0|This book is the middle book of the \\"Hunger Game\\" series. In my experience most of these transition books are horribly boring either because the author is just reliving the first book or because the author just doesn't cover any new ground, or both.<br /><br />I expected at least good things from this book judging by the first book. Let's just say I had high hopes. Then we can say that I was not only not disappointed, but I loved this book. There were references made to events in book 1, but they were never boring or overdone. They almost always fit the rhythm of the story line and made sense, like a recollection, not a full-blown \\"let's relive the first book\\" wallow. Lots happened in this book that was new and exciting.<br /><br />I absolutely won't give away anything, because it is so good you need to see for yourself. All I can say is there are twists and turns that are unexpected and surprising. One could pick up this book and get the \\"flavor\\" of what went on before, without having read the first book. But, the end is a cliff-hanger, and now I can't wait for book three.<br /><br />Once again, they have set up the target age for this book to be 12, junior high age. My granddaughter is 8 now, and I'm not sure in 4 years she will be ready for these. I still think 15 or 16, possibly a very mature 14 year old would be about right, due to the violence in these books.
B000TPZJNE|5.0|Unbelievably as awesome as the original issue; I could listen to Dark Side all friggin day!  Pink Floyd rules.
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|In a few words, some of these remastered versions of true masterpieces leave VERY much to be desired, especially after all this hype surrounding their release. You wonder how many  enthusiastic reviewers showing up everywhere were bought by Apple or SONY. Disclaimer: I am a die-hard Beatles fan, I love their music, so please understand: I am not trying to destroy this remastered edition; it is simply disappointing. The vocals and  harmonies are really thin, you cannot feel the \\"flesh\\" of Beatles voices, their vocal presence is vague and very distant, the  subtle inflections in the interpretation are now hard to find. You can tell this comes from an insufficient, badly performed compression, and a bad equalization that criminally diminished the midrange frequencies where the vocals were dominant. You can see this feature on a basic EQ spectrum analyzer. It is surprising how thin and muffled the bass is, too e.g. on \\"Come Together\\" the well-known signature bass sounds muffled and weird, Lennon's voice is thin and not at a consistent level, like some portions of the vocal track had slightly faded here and there. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is the best sounding piece on this album, somehow approaching the quality of the original vinyl version, except the drums and clapping part in the second half, which lacks definition in the highs and its airy quality and freedom inspiring beauty have been killed by lack of headroom, being strangely compressed and constrained. \\"Because\\" and \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" have distinguishably loud hissing noise at unbelievable levels at the start of the song, like a bad tape or a worn vinyl. It can give the impression that the \\"great work of remastering\\" was simply a raw analog copying session from a vinyl LP. We have to admit, somehow re-mastering engineers have been almost successful in making this digital version sound closer to the analog LP vinyls; maybe this is the secret that makes so many people happy of what they hear: the use of digital tricks to mimic the vinyl sound on a CD. However, the vocal quality and the warm presence, the depth of the harmonies and the polyphony of the original Beatles, the subtle details of exotic instruments, the vibrant dynamic and the headroom are all missing in this re-massacred version. It is very disappointing to hear all these qualities lacking in the epic medley of the legendary second part. Overall the sound is flat, the voices are thin and coming from far away, the brilliant piano arpeggios in \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" are almost undetectable, the whole second part lacks the amazingly complex polyphony that made it so wonderful. I insert here a comment about \\"The Beatles Past Masters\\" double CD, too: the re-mastering of the songs after \\"The Inner Light\\" was probably performed by someone totally incompetent, and different from the engineers working on \\"Day Tripper\\", \\"We can work it out\\", \\"Paperback Writer\\" and \\"Rain\\" which all sound very good, fresh, properly compressed, perfectly emphasizing vocals and harmonies and giving you the same good vibes and exuberant emotional state as the original Beatles singles and LPs. On \\"Past Masters\\" when you reach \\"Hey Jude\\" the volume drops significantly from the previous song, which is totally unacceptable for a CD at this level. And this is just the tip of the iceberg: Paul's voice is thin, the songs lacks its charm and ooomph of the final \\"Nah-nah-nah-nah\\" part, being badly compressed at a very low level. \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" is crap: George Harrison's vocals are uneven and spotty. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was one the best of Beatles songs in 1969 and such a pure and direct expression of John Lennon's soul, insecurity and inner cravings; but this remastered version sounds flat, flat, flat; it is a massacre. \\"Get Back\\" was also destroyed by a sloppy, insufficient compression: vocals are de-emphasized by a decrease in midrange equalization, the dynamic of this great song was killed, and this is evident even from the flattenedcrescendo in the beginning of the song. This re-mastering work should have been done by George Martin and Giles Martin, true to the core of the Beatles sound and original generous polyphony, and it should have been released in the highest audio definition available: SACD, DVD Audio or Blue-Ray audio, to preserve their full presence and live  feeling, including a re-release in analog format (LPs on vinyl) to honor the great cultural legacy of The Beatles as they truly deserve.

B000002KD5|4.0|This was Fleetwood Mac's first album with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. It was a roaring success that gave them 3 top twenty singles and a #1 album. This album features Buckingham's trademark arrangements and Stevie Nicks breaking out with her gypsy-witch persona on the classic Rhiannon. This lineup of the group was magic onstage and in the studio and set the stage for their epic-blockbuster Rumours. It's a great place to start for both casual fans and fans of soft rock in general. The whole group shines on this one and you won't be disappointed. The remastering job on this is first-rate. Highlights:    Rhiannon  Over My Head  Crystal  Landslide  World Turning  I'm So Afraid    All of these are also concert as well as radio staples. You can't go wrong with this one.
1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins' book The Greatest Show on Earth is currently high on bestseller lists in many countries. The book removes what was the missing link in Dawkins' oeuvre because in all his others books he started from the assumption that evolution was true. In this one he presents the evidence. Let's walk through the book in some big steps.<br /><br />In Chapter 1, Dawkins introduces the word THEORUM as a replacement of the word 'theory' which in everyday use often just means hypothesis. The word 'theorum' (inspired by the word 'theorem' from mathematics) would do justice to the fact that evolution is massively supported by evidence and therefore by no means just a hypothesis. Chapter 2 describes how we can sculpt gene pools through artificial selection (for instance dog breeding), a practice which has been known to men, of course, long before Darwin came to the scene. Chapter 3 explains differences between artificial, sexual, and natural selection. Chapter 4 shows we know for SURE how old the earth is. It presents two of the three methods (tree rings and radioactive clocks). Chapter 5 shows examples of evolution we can see before our very eyes (for instance with bacteria and with guppies). It is also a powerful explanation of how the existence of evolution has been empirically demonstrated through experiments. And experiments are of course an indispensible part of doing science because of their power to show causal relations. Chapter 6 and 7 are is about fossil evidence for evolution and it debunks some common misunderstandings, like the one that intermediate fossils are still missing which would prove that evolution would not be true. The chapter shows that not only intermediate fossils aren't missing, even if they would be missing that would not disprove evolution at all. In fact, even without any fossil evidence, the evidence for evolution would still be watertight. So fossil evidence serves to underline all the other evidence. Also, the fact that no fossil has ever been found in the 'wrong' time period (which would work to disprove evolution) further strengthens the case. Chapter 8 explains how embryology is a matter of self-assembly-processes all the way which goes against the idea that humans grow according to some kind of blueprint. Chapter 9 is about 'islands' or the powerful biogeographic evidence for evolution. Chapter 10 deals with tree of cousinship and molecular evidence (and molecular clocks). Chapter 11 shows how bodies aren't designed but gradually evolved and seem like imperfect patchworks. Chapter 12 is about evolutionary arms races and their apparent futility which is another reason why creationism is so very unlikely and illogical. Chapter 13 is one big reflection on the last poetic paragraph of Darwin's On the Origin of Species.<br /><br />Reading the book, I came across many little details I did not know and also some more fundamental insights  and facts that I was not fully aware of. While reading the book I thought how paradoxical it seems how people expressing some very uninformed and outdated opinions and views can actually play a very useful role. Perhaps, were it not for them doing this and for the influence they surprisingly have, people like Dawkins would not take the trouble to keep on explaining scientific findings in such accessible ways. I am convinced that almost any part of this book can be rather easily understood by the majority of people and I am happy to see how many people are interested enough to actually buy it.found in the 'wrong' time period (which would work to disprove evolution) further strengthens the case.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice In Chains's Dirt, released in 1992, almost singlehandedly got me interested in heavier music.  Since AIC's eponymous last official album in 1995, an unbelievable 14 years ago, my musical tastes have evolved and expanded dramatically into realms well outside of hard rock, but AIC has remained as one of the most hallowed acts in my CD collection ever since that time.  When I heard that AIC was reforming with new co-vocalist William Duvall succeeding the inimitable late Layne Staley, I was immediately both intrigued and frightened, lest the legendary track record of AIC be derailed by a sub-par imitation.  Those fears were dispelled upon seeing AIC live, on their first tour with Duvall, last year.  Duvall's voice, along with the songs I had grown so accustomed to hearing, was absolutely mindblowing.<br /><br />Then came the announcement by Jerry Cantrell, main AIC songwriter and vocalist, that AIC was going to release their first studio album since Alice in Chains.  While I was overly excited at that notion, I couldn't help but be worried that Cantrell had a bigger set of balls than brains.  A platter of anything less than AIC legacy-quality new material would undoubtedly destroy a good portion of the AIC fanbase.  Upon first listen of new album Black Gives Way to Blue, however, I can tell you that my worries should never have existed; in fact, never again will I doubt the AIC crew.<br /><br />Put simply, Black Gives Way to Blue is the best material AIC has done in their entire careers since Dirt, and in some parts it even surpasses the 1992 opus.  BGWtB encapsulates all the different sounds with which AIC experimented over their previously short lifespan, from Facelift all the way to Alice in Chains.  Cantrell's songwriting quality, having decreased somewhat on his solo outings from 1998-2002, is back like it never skipped a beat.  BGWtB contains all the elements that made AIC a unique band:  dark, gloomy, and mysterious lyrics, dirgy and heavy chords and song structures, tons of sound layering, and most notably, vocal interplay and harmonizing.  Some of BGWtB's songs could easily have been located on albums of old:  opener \\"All Secrets Known\\" sounds like a heavy incarnation of Jar of Flies's \\"Rotten Apple,\\" the acoustic-based \\"Your Decision\\" wouldn't have been out of place on Cantrell's solo Degradation Trip (save the dual vocals), the first single \\"A Looking in View\\" crawls at a doomy and heavy pace first shown on Facelift, and \\"Private Hell\\" is the modern-day accompaniment to Dirt's \\"Down in a Hole.\\"  That's not to say that AIC's sound doesn't continue to evolve, though.  \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\" takes the wonderful acoustic notes illustrated on Sap and converts them to a tried-and-true AIC tune.  \\"Acid Bubble\\" plays off of Alice in Chains's \\"Again\\" and flows back-and-forth between slow melody and neck-snapping, chugging heavy riffs.  Album closer \\"Black Gives Way to Blue,\\" featuring piano work by Elton John, is perhaps the first true depressive ballad the band have constructed since Jar of Flies's \\"Nutshell,\\" consisting solely of dual vocals, emotive piano, and weeping guitar leads.<br /><br />What's most impressive about BGWtB, though, is how absolutely effortless it all seems to be.  The sheer urgency of BGWtB's sound is easily evident, as if AIC somehow never ceased making music, certainly not for 14 years.  What I thought would be the toughest part to swallow, the inclusion of William Duvall, is actually the best part of the album.  Layne Staley's trademark voice certainly cannot be duplicated, but Duvall is so similar in tone, though slightly more nasal, that during certain points of BGWtB it sounds exactly like Staley never left.  Duvall pulls off the co-vocalist job with casual aplomb, sounding like a breath of fresh air when he sings on his own (as in \\"Last of My Kind\\" and \\"Acid Bubble\\"), and to spine-tingling effect when his voice coalesces with Cantrell's.<br /><br />With Black Gives Way to Blue, Alice in Chains has constructed a musical work of wonderful, masterful quality.  Undoubtedly aware of criticisms that will roll in as a result of Duvall's work (unfair criticisms at that), Alice in Chains has created an album of which the late Layne Staley would be very proud.  If the meaning of \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" is akin to that of a healing bruise, and if this record is simply the \\"blue\\" portion of that bruise on its way to disappearance, then I cannot wait until Alice in Chains is in full recovery.  Doubts be damned, Alice in Chains is back and better than ever.ork of wonderful, masterful quality.

B000R9J3XE|5.0|The greatest hits package for the relatively unknown and underrated band Garbage. They combined punk/trip-hop/rock/pop for a very contemporary style featuring the incisive lyrics from Shirley Manson, the band's vocalist. Their first 2 releases were critically acclaimed but they soon started losing steam with their 3rd release, Beautiful Garbage. The music lost some of its original quality but the hits kept coming and there have always been at least 2-3 gems even on their worst albums. This one covers all their best and fans of that era of music will recognize many songs from the radio. For the casual fan, you will find all that you want here although I would recommend the first two albums as well.     Highly Recommended
1932100660|1.0|Colin Campbell is so intent on promoting a vegan data that he misrepresents the data in the real China Study and cherry picks anti-animal food data.  For instance, he rightly cites the link between milk and autoimmune disease but fails to mention that gluten, from wheat and related grains, is at least as important a cause.  He writes of the association between casein, a milk protein, with cancer, but fails to mention that whey and butterfat are protective against cancer, and in milk you get all of them.  He makes completely false statements like folate not being in meat when organ meats are much higher in folate than any plant source according to the USDA.  He assumes nutrient consistency with the US without actually measuring it, despite the fact that soil nutrients and species differences have a huge effect on nutrition.      On cancer, he uses this data from the real China Study [[ASIN:0198569335 Mortality, Biochemistry, Diet and Lifestyle in Rural China: Geographic Study of the Characteristics of 69 Counties in Mainland China and 16 Areas in Taiwan]] and claims it shows you shouldn't eat animal protein, but in fact it shows just the opposite.  The higher the positive number, the more the cancer association.  The negative numbers show that a food source, like fats (lipids) actually protect against cancer.  (Yes, mildly lowers the risk.)    Associations of Selected Variables with Mortality for All Cancers in the China Study  Total Protein +12%  Animal Protein +3%  Fish Protein +7%  Plant Protein +12%  Total Lipids -6%    Carbohydrates +23%  Total Calories +16%  Fat % Calories -17%  Fiber +21%  Fat (questionnaire) -29%*   ==============================  (Data taken from the original monograph of the China Study.)      Sugar, soluble carbohydrates, and fiber all have correlations with cancer mortality about seven times the magnitude of that with animal protein, and total fat and fat as a percentage of calories were both negatively correlated with cancer mortality. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't eat protein, because the correlation of eating all food with cancer is +100%, but chances are the higher fat and protein diet will be safer than a high carbohydrate diet.    Why do I say \\"chances are\\"?  A correlation is only as good as the data it collects.  In China, people wealthy enough to have animal protein are also more likely to eat sugar, processed foods, high fructose corn syrup, to lower vegetable intake and to be able to drive instead of bicycle.  They are also more likely to live in the heavily polluted urban centers.  This information was not collected, and may actually be causal as opposed to be merely correlated.    The only questions in the China study about protein consumption were 'how many times a month do you eat  fish/meat/eggs/dairy?' There were no questions about which of those foods you eat.  For instance, oysters are so important a source of zinc, that native New Guinea tribesmen who live in the interior and have access to meat, insist on going through a war zone to get the oysters once a month. Or they arrange an exchange of mountain fruits for oysters with the very tribes they are fighting.  But there were no questions that differentiated fish, which have very different profiles from shellfish.    The same China study (the real one, not this book) also shows living in a hot climate is highly correlated with low cancer.  This exceeds the effect of animal protein by over 700% It also show that homemade cigarettes and alcohol are negatively correlated with cancer, but not at a significant level.  But he isn't mentioning that.     He misrepresents any number of studies that he cites, taking one described by the researcher as \\"high protein and low fat\\" and labels it as low protein.  He shows an appalling lack of knowledge in the constituents of meats.  He suggests Alzheimers can be prevented by a vegan diet, ignoring the vast literature on the preventative aspects of DHA which is only found in animals and marine plankton.  His ideology prevents an honest evaluation of the data.    A pity that the original study is not affordable to the average reader because Campbell is a poor representative of the data and what it means.
0385504225|3.0|It had its moments, and was filled with several fun factoids, but was a little too drawn out.  The antagonist's motives were almost silly and somewhat far fetched.  Formulaic Dan Brown; if this book was his first release it might left a greater impression on me. From the get go, you know Langdon will at some point get to the Washington Monument, and very early on it was easy to catch on about who Mal'ach really was...The threads connecting science and religion were interesting as was some of Langdon's theological introspection.      Like I said before, formulaic Dan Brown, but still a fun read...
B000H6SXMY|5.0|All these years later, the show still works.  It's the kind of show that was made possible and unique by a fantastic ensemble.  The writing never needed to be even great for a show to make you laugh.  It was by and large an opportunity for a perfectly cast group of friends to be brought to life by some talented actors.  While these actors may never go on to do anything else that comes close to what they did with friends, the show will still be remembered for a long time.
B001EO748M|5.0|I thought Season 1 was fantastic, but Season 2 takes it up a notch, with the focus on Anne Boleyn, the tragic second wife of Henry VIII.  The actress portraying Anne, Natalie Dormer, is phenomenal; not only does she enjoy outstanding chemistry with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry), but her performance just keeps getting better and better as Anne spirals downward from beloved wife to accused adulterer and traitor!  The finale is a masterpiece on film, as Anne goes bravely to her unjust death on the scaffold.  I read that the entire cast gave her a standing ovation after her last scene was filmed, and I can certainly understand why!  Natalie Dormer's scenes with JRM are outstanding, and so incredibly real - you really feel their passion in all of their scenes, whether it is love or hatred.  I never wanted season 2 to end, but sadly for Anne Boleyn, we all know what a tragic fate awaited her.      I LOVE this show so much that I am planning a Tudors Tour of England next spring for all Tudor fans!  [...]

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Nothing new to add to the other fine reviews here - this film is up there in my Top 10 movies - so buying the Bootleg (Director's) Cut was always on the cards.  The 2 x DVD, 1 x CD package has the original theatrical version and a Bootleg Cut with an extra 35 minutes (always seems strange to me that a 'cut' actually has more content). The exclusive CD is a mini album of tunes performed by Stillwater (the 'band' that performs in the film). A well presented set (although to me the artwork seems a bit 'dark' considering the fun nature of the movie).  An absolute must for any fan of the movie.
B0025KVLU6|1.0|First let me get it out of the way by saying I am a huge beatles fan. However, I just don't see the point in buying a \\"Remastered\\" Album by ANY artist.  \\"Remaster\\" is simply a industry buzz word.  All it means is that the album is cleaned up from the originals so to speak.  Oh yeah and they throw in the bells and whistles of glossy photos and all the song lyrics.  Oooh big deal!  As far as I am concerned, it isn't a very big difference from what I've heard, and a few tracks I've listened to so far.  That is all fine and dandy, if you are adding to your collection with albums you don't already own.   But, frankly most Beatles fans are die hard fans, and already own all of the studio albums.  I don't understand why anyone would want to shell out more money for an album they already have, for very tiny improvements and a few bells and whistles.  It is just another way for Apple to financially cash in on the cash cow that is the Beatles.  As a fan, I am angry that Apple would be so greedy, and in a way I feel they are taking advantage of us.  They didn't do this for their fans.  They did it out of GREED plain Greed.  Why don't they just give us what we want and release Beatles on I-Tunes. I know that issue is quite complicated and easier said than done, especially with the remaining members all having to agree before a project or release is committed to.  But they can do a lot better then just releasing \\"Remasters\\" and crap like \\"Across the Universe\\" and the even more dreadful \\"Love\\"

B0000C9ZBW|4.0|Very attractive watch - clear, spare design - easy to read face with luminous marks that are barely funtional in the dark. The clasp didn't work well at all - I almost lost the watch numerous times because it didn't snap shut properly. I was able to adjust the metal closure hook with a pair of plyers and now it works reasonably well. Does not have a second hand or a date marker. This is a watch more for dress than for everyday.
0385504225|1.0|I love Dan Brown books! I've been waiting for this one for years and what did I get?!! A Huge Disappointment!   Come on!   He is a very creative writer, he does tones of research before he starts writing and all he could think of a Turkish prison from 'Midnight Express' and Japanese director from 'The Incredibles'! Not to forget the Abyss' of course... It's very lame! He should have put more thought in to this! Also, he is global! His books have been selling for millions around the world... He should try and be more careful when making quotes regarding other cultures, countries and religions.   Dr.Solomon does not even know how to use his new I-phone, he doesn't even know how to text message and his sister believes that he is really sending her a message! There are a lot of nonsense events in this book and I did not even finish reading it because it was so predictable.... you got the idea! While reading the first page I knew whatever he would be looking for would end up under the monument!
1416594787|5.0|This book is great for both the beginner in evolution and for the hardcore biologist who wants some light reading. Dawkins does as good as job as anyone can in breaking down evolution for the regular reader all while inserting interesting examples and interesting footnotes along the way. This books rivals any of Steven J. Gould's writings in readability, educational value, and entertainment.  This book goes over the basics of natural selection, mutation, speciation, and the fossil record. If I have one problem it's that the book could of gone a lot more in depth in places such as the chapter on human origins. However, seeing as how the book is as long as it is this probably wouldn't be feasible. At least in places where Dawkin's had to only give the basics on a subject he usually referred to either a previous work of his where he explains it in more detail or in another book (such as \\"Why Evolution is True\\").  Overall I definitely recommend this book for both those who know about evolution and for the creationists who obviously don't yet understand evolution. If you plan on studying the subject intensely then this won't be the only book you need on your shelf, but it is definitely a good place to start.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This is a book that should be left behind in an airplane.  Dan Brown took little care in writing it, so why should you take care of it? As mentioned in other reviews, this book seriously needs an editor. There is endless repetition - it reads as if Brown left the manuscript untouched for days at a time, then simply picked up where he left off without bothering to refresh his memory about things he'd already told us. The best part of the book is the information about buildings and architecture in Washington, which will lead to an upsurge in tourism and traffic.  The worst is the careless writing, the frankly ridiculous plot and the one-dimensional characters.  One plot element that even the publisher's janitor should have pointed out to Brown is that his CIA Director Sato (a spin-off of a James Bond villain but not nearly as entertaining) should have been arrested for pursuing a domestic criminal matter in the United States - a clear violation of the CIA's mandate.  The plot, such as it is, should have involved the FBI but that agency doesn't even get mentioned. Instead the CIA swoop down and around Washington streets and homes in a helicopter, rather than a car, and threaten Langdon with all sorts of unmentionable CIA punishment if he doesn't drop everything to help prevent the revelation of Masonic rituals to a breathlessly awaiting world.  Oh, puh-leeze.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I think Stephen Sommers (\\"The Mummy\\", \\"The Mummy Returns\\") had fun making this film. This tongue in cheek tribute to the classic horror films from the 1930's and 1940's is a thrilling ride with an amazing sequence of visuals. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Dracula's lair with the frozen ice sickles hanging from the ceiling and furniture, to the marvelously dark scenes of the Dracula castle high up in the craggy mountain ranges, to the splendor of the Fellini like ballroom scene inside a Cathedral with its motley group of guests. Perhaps we could have done without the initial battle between Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and the grotesquely huge, cigar smoking, Mr. Hyde, but once we get beyond this point the film is charmingly engaging as we move from one visual spectacle into the next as Van Helsing and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), and the friar, Carl(David Wenham), battle the likes of Dracula, the Werewolf, and the Frankenstein monster. This movie was created with the energy and spirit of movies like \\"The Mummy\\" or the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\".  Pop up some popcorn and then just sit back and enjoy this roller coaster ride!
0385504225|2.0|As many of you, I was an instant Dan Brown fan after reading the DaVinci Code.  Soon there after, I read his previous novels in reverse order of publication only to be more disappointed with each novel.  My thought then was, and it should stand to reason, that The Lost Symbol would be amazing.    I am sorry to report, however, that The Lost Symbol rates below Angels and Demons on my \\"Liking\\" scale.  Question: What went wrong? It was all there; the story line, the research, the protagonist, the antagonist, the urgency - Everything!  Answer: the presentation and execution were almost; terrible.  While there were moments where I found myself in a \\"DaVinci-like\\" trance and unable to set the book down, those moments were far too few and far between.      There was a real sense of disconnection within the text.  It is almost as thought there were three separate writing/creative sessions if you will.  The first part of the novel was slow to develop and not very captivating from a reader's perspective.  The middle section - which is by far the best from a flow and interest perspective - had a very different feel than the other two.  And lastly, the third section, or last 60 - 70 pages, were completely disparate and could be omitted.  I would even be so bold as to say the experience would have been more pleasing to me had they not been included.    This is not the first time my expectations were not met; shame on me, I just was expecting more...
0385504225|3.0|Similarly to Michael Crichton fans, there are some of us that like thrillers with a smart plot buit on well research subject, so we do not expect a work of literature in this type of novel. Brown accomplishes that, so if you enjoy [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] and [[ASIN:B002976NLW Angels & Demons]], definitively this is a book you want to read, you will be entertained for most of the 500 pages.  However, despite of being a Brown fan, I rated the book just with three stars due to the following shortcomings.<br /><br />Leaving literary critic aside, I felt that some of the explanations went into unnecessary and sometimes boring detail, and here, Brown is beginning to look like Crichton's latest novels, already presenting in the book the draft script for a movie. Also, the ending is unnecessary extended, the after talks and final reflections are not that interesting, and actually some of the info could have been included before the real end of the story.<br /><br />As opposed to the Da Vinci Code, some of the potential and surprising facts and discoveries were undoubtedly spoiled by the film [[ASIN:B00005JN5E National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)]], though Brown goes into much more detail and fully explores the influence of freemasonry among several of the key American founding fathers, and also did not miss the opportunity to bust plenty of myths surrounding this fraternity.  Another d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling originates from the evolution of the Mal'akh character, who as the story advances looks too much to the Tooth Fairy character in the film [[ASIN:B00005JLKN Red Dragon (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]. There is plenty of mysticism and even new age discourse, too much for my taste, but for those who enjoy there are even a couple of mentions to the 2012 Mayan prediction.
0061730327|5.0|Disclaimer: I met William Kamkwamba through the TED ([...]) community. I contribute to [...], the nonprofit that supports his work. I co-hosted a party to celebrate the publication of this book.   Why?  I spent two decades as a journalist, and his is one of the most fascinating, instructional, uplifting stories I've ever heard.  This book is a brilliant meld of William's work and that of his co-author, Bryan Mealer. Bryan painstakingly immersed himself in William's life in Malawi, essentially covering this story like the experienced reporter he is. With the help of a translator, the poetry and humor of William's personality shines through on each page.  William's story has awakened in me a new appreciation for so much that I take for granted in my daily life: electricity, the ability to turn on a light after dark, readily available clean water, free public education, internet connections, and yes, more than a mouthful of food each day.  This book is great for book clubs, young people, families, and anyone who likes a story of hope and triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds.  William's English is much better now than it was when he and Bryan set out to write this book. Perhaps you saw him on Good Morning America being interviewed by Diane Sawyer, or heard him on the radio being interviewed by Diane Rehm, or maybe you caught him on the BBC.  Please buy this book - you'll love it, and you will be glad you invested in this young man's future.

0066620996|5.0|The book of the week was Good to Great by Jim Collins. This is considered a \\"must read\\" by most of the professors I have had. I think the book was pretty good. I definitely think it was a little harder to get through than most books, but that is because all the evidence in the book is backed up by cold hard facts. I would say the reading of this book is in between a business textbook and a motivational how-to book.<br /><br />The book lays out a pattern of companies that made the jump from being a good company to a great company. Collins follows 11 good-to-great companies and 11 comparison companies. He noticed a pattern in companies that made it to good-to-great status. They all have certain attributes: Disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action.<br /><br />After reading I decided that there are three ideas that are very important to achieving a successful business. Level 5 leadership, the Hedgehog Concept, and BHAG (Big Huge Audacious Goals.) If you have these ideas at the base of your organization, you are well on your way to success.<br /><br />The first is Level 5 leadership, the book definition is: Builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. Most people never make it to this stage in their leadership and if you think you are a level 5 leader... you're not. Part of being a level 5 leader is having the ability to step back from the limelight and look at what is best for the company, no matter what. Most people don't even know of level 5 leaders because they aren't the ones getting the credit. They are more concerned with taking the company to where it needs to go than to get credit for it. Most of the time they credit successes to those around them and throw blame to themselves for all the failures. Although these people are a needle in a haystack, you get one and you are well on your way to greatness.<br /><br />The next idea is the Hedgehog Concept. I love this one. You put your focus on three areas... what you are passionate about, what generates your revenue, and what you are best at. This makes up the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept. If you take those three circles and focus on where they overlap, you have your hedgehog. Just imagine, everyone at a company being passionate about what they do, being great at it, and generating revenue the whole time. Putting all those ideas together just sounds amazing.<br /><br />Another idea I wanted to throw at you is BHAG. It sounds simple, but most people don't know how to make their Big Huge Audacious Goals effective. They get focused on things they aren't good at just because it seems like a good idea at the time. The way to focus your BHAG is to look back toward the Hedgehog. The place where your three circles intersect is where you do you goal setting.<br /><br />If a company can couple the Hedgehog and BHAG with a Level 5 Leader, I can't imagine it failing. It would have incredible controlled growth doing things that matter for the people that work there. If I ever start a company, I will make sure that I implement these concepts. And I really don't think I will ever get to be a level 5 leader, but I know that if I ever find one, I will hold onto him or her and we will do great things together. I do want to say that Collins talks about companies rushing into things too quick. When making a company great, it takes time. Most of these companies did it over the span of several years. Rushing into things is a sure way to get in over your head and not make the jump to greatness.<br /><br />I think this book is very good and also very informative. There is so much information on this book I could write for pages and not even touch some of the material. Seriously, Jim Collins and his research team worked on this for 5 years! Not something I can sum up in a few paragraph review. And I think the book has very powerful information that is invaluable to any entrepreneur or manager. However, I don't think itis for everyone. This book would seem a lot like studying for a lot of people, especially if you are not particularly concerned with the ideas behind making a organization great. But if you do read this, go in with an open mind and think about how you might be able to incorporate the material into your personal life. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask me a question. I would be more than happy to help anyone that needs it.<br /><br />[...]ng for a lot of people, especially if you are not particularly concerned with the ideas behind making a organization great.

1400063515|4.0|Though his criticism of the bell curve (normal distribution) is sometimes exaggerated and certainly it does not applies to plenty of engineering applications and other applied fields, Taleb is quite right to note the tendency of modern society with Platonicity, the tendency to think that we understand more than we actually do, or better yet, what Taleb calls the \\"illusion of understanding\\". Are you skeptical?  All you have to do is remember of the recent financial crash and the role that financial simulations models had in it. The financial system went from random walks to a full blown super Black Swan! To his merit, Taleb's book was published before the 2007-2008 Financial Crash, even though he said after the fact that this was not a Black Swan?<br /><br />The book is quite interesting, however, its structure is confusing, a bit repetitive, and what I consider its main weakness, Taleb's egocentric style keeps popping up everywhere, combined with the same arrogance he criticizes economists and financial gurus. Taleb's criticism also applies to climate models and other fields of science where uncertainty and complexity are ignored just as they were in financial risk modeling.<br /><br />If you think you can endure Taleb's ego, this is recommended reading for understanding the failure of the financial models and its contribution to the overconfidence and distorsions that trigger the current crises. Also you might go directly the his main source and inspiration, Mandelbrot's [[ASIN:0465043577 The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence]], quite an early prevention that this misuse of modeling might happen, despite the consensus among financial geniuses. For a complementary reading, go to Soro's [[ASIN:1586486993 The Crash of 2008 and What it Means: The New Paradigm for Financial Markets]], though I prefer Taleb's approach.
0385737424|3.0|This book will probably rightfully win liteary awards, but it is not the type of book that I think my 10 and 11 year old boys would enjoy (i.e. literary accolades, but not necessarily universal intended audience kid appeal).  I would compare this book to a lovely hike, where you notice beautiful things to admire and enjoy.  On such a hike, my boys would be yelling, \\"Are we there yet?\\"  Now, honestly, not all kids are alike.  Some kids like hikes, and see the beauty in nature.  Others want a different experience.  I would recommend this book to thoughtful kids who like quiet books with insights gained from the character's growth... such as Sharon Creech's Walk Two Moons, or Paterson's The Bridge to Terabithia.  And, admittedly, I have met quite a few kids who really do like those type of books.  My boys, instead, are currently reading on their own Kinney's Wimpy Kid series, Erin Hunter's Warrior series, and Chris D' Lacey's dragon trilogy. So, there you go; I'm obviously biased toward \\"fast\\" moving books.     UPDATE:  I wrote my original review Fall 2009.  On January 18, 2010, the book did win the Newbery.
0439023491|5.0|Just as good as alot the books that suck you in and make you stay up all night reading.  Just as good, maybe better, than Hunger Games.
0762434279|5.0|The book this week was Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. Amazing book. Kiyosaki's title comes from his upbringing. He had his biological father, a PhD educated professor, and his best friend's father, a serial entrepreneur. The first dad was the poor dad and the second was the rich. His poor father told him to work hard and get a good education and he would get a good job to take care of him. His rich father told him to go against the norms of society and gain financial independence.<br /><br />The first step to gaining your financial independence is learning how to apply accounting concepts to your personal life. It's real simple and Kiyosaki says the reason most adults don't catch on is because it's too simple. But the trick is all about cashflow. You have to make sure your assets are greater than your expenses. The hardest part about this is determining what an asset is. An asset is anything that is going to perpetually give you income: stocks, bonds, notes, some real estate, etc. Most people don't worry about making the assets greater than their expenses and for those people... it doesn't matter how much money you give them, they will always be in over their head just scratching to pay off bills. Kiyosaki's poor father was making a great salary, but he didn't know how to regulate his cashflow so he was always over his head.<br /><br />One issue in the book, which is brought up quite often, is that going to school and getting a good education is not enough to get everything you want. If you go to school, pass you classes with straight As and get into a high paying job... The government is still going to reach into your check before you can even spend a cent and tax you 40-50%. That means that you work your new job out of school and the first 4 to 5 months you are working goes straight to the government. Doesn't seem fair.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kiyosaki points out what the rich do. They use corporations to protect their money from the government. A loop hole that politicians put into the books to help themselves (the rich). You see, when you have a corporation you don't get taxed until after you have spent all your money. That means that instead of the average American who is getting paid $30,000 a year, who gets 40% taken right off the top, who can spend $18,000 on their needs and wants. A corporation that makes $30,000 a year and can spend as much of that $30,000 on company cars, dinners with clients, company housing and then gets taxed on what is left after those purchases. Sounds a lot better... and anyone can start a corporation.<br /><br />Kiyosaki was taught at a early age how to play the game by his rich dad. When he grew up he worked at a job just like everyone else, at Xerox. While he was at Xerox he started a Real Estate Holding Company and while he worked his day-job he flipped houses on the side. He had the best of both worlds. So in case you were wondering, you don't have to quit your day-job to be an entrepreneur.<br /><br />You may call me naive, but I honestly do think that every single person has what it takes to be a millionaire. They just let fear and cynicism control them. They fear losing their money and they are a cynic of anyone that is trying to do something great... \\"That will never work\\"... I cringe at these words and I have done my best to avoid people that spout these words because in the words of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra \\"Tell me what company you keep and I'll tell you what you are.\\"<br /><br />I do think you can do it. And I think if you are willing to put yourself out there, your million dollar dream is not far away. Read this book, it's an eye opener. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask me a question. I would be more than happy to help anyone that needs it.<br /><br />[...]put into the books to help themselves (the rich).

6301174240|5.0|I love my moonwalker, even though I had to get mine used and through a different sellor. It was still in great shape, and mine played michael jackson \\"Bad\\" pepsi commercial. I love it! it has been awhile since I had watched this last, I believe since it first came out in the 80s. Since I had purchased this one, I watch it every chance I get. This is Michael at his finest, he so cute in this, especially in speed deman. Of course it opens up with my favorite the man in the mirror, and goes on to play ABC, and Music and me, and Badder, I really like leave me alone, then it goes to the short film of smoothwalker, great! michael jackson was so creative, and masterful, this movie speaks volumes on his greatness. Having the clamations in this movie, I believe Michael was a transformer way before transformer came out. Great Movie! I really love at the end when he sings come together, I think he sings it better than the beatles, well he much more sexier, then they were, I could watch that part all day, Yumm, Michael jackson certainly had it, and I can not wait for this to be remastered on DVD.
0385504225|3.0|I, along with many other people, was excited to hear that Dan Brown was finally coming out with another Robert Langdon book. It was slow starting--much slower than Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code--but eventually I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, in the end I have to say that it really wasn't worth more than 3 out of 5 stars. Although it was as well-researched as Dan Brown's other books, I feel as if the story itself simply wasn't as gripping, and although it of course had the usual Dan Brown twist, I definitely don't think it was as good as the one in The Da Vinci code. Of course, I have to admit that, it having been years and years since I read the first two Robert Langdon books, my taste in novels has very possibly changed. Still, I would be surprised if many people really believe that this book was anywhere near as good as the first two. Especially as it turned very preachy at the end--and on top of that, seemed like one big advertisement for smartphones (Blackberries and iPhones especially).
B0006AAS5G|1.0|I reviewed this watch when I originally bought it...sad to say that it broke within a year. The time was wildly off. I don't think it was worth the money. My original review is as follows:<br /><br />I bought this watch for my younger brother for his birthday.<br /><br />I have to agree with previous posts - this watch is beautiful.<br /><br />It has the right amount of heaviness to it and looks like any other luxury watch in terms of quality.<br /><br />I am sure that there are major differences between how his watch and a Rolex operate, but if you're simply looking for a beautiful watch, this is it.<br /><br />My brother is quite large - 6'5\\" and 200 lbs - and this watch was a great size.
0671646788|5.0|This was a very good book! I actually got it as a gift from my girlfriend last year. Being the thoughtful girl she is, she looked at Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Work Week (One of my favorite books) and pulled it from the number 1 slot on his \\"books to read\\" list.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that wants success, big house, nice car, well-rounded family, great friends and a rewarding life (and I presume most everyone is) then you should read this book. Schwartz introduces the idea that your success relies on controlling your brain power. If you want to be successful then tell yourself that you are successful and your brain, being the amazing creation is it, will snap into action and come up with all the ways you are successful and create ways for you to be more successful. However, if you say to yourself, \\"I am not successful,\\" your brain will use its power to come up with reasons you are not successful and will introduce more ways you can bring yourself down. The same idea affects ever facet of your life. If you say \\"I love my friends and family,\\" \\"I am having a great day,\\" or \\" I am going to be creative today\\"- your mind kicks in and puts generates all the mental stimulates that make that statement true. When you are feeling sad, just smile. It may be difficult to do but if you force yourself to smile for about 5 minutes and try to consciously be happy... you will be. Now, it may be difficult to constantly be positive because there are so many distractions and emotions sometimes affect us. You just have to remember what really matters.<br /><br />Schwartz also goes into depth about treating people the right way. He tells a story about a couple consultants that are on their way to a clients business. The whole way there, the consultants talk bad about the client. How he is unintelligent, fat, slow, etc. When they got there, those emotions still had control over their minds. They appeared distant to the client and not very friendly. Later they got a letter that announced the man would like to stop using them for future business. If those same men talked about how great this client was the whole way there, they would have probably kept the client because they would be acting like they like being around him. The same idea goes for your subordinates at work, if you take care of them- then they will take care of you. Find out what they want to do, what ideas they have, and encourage them. This coupled with enthusiasm will push you where ever you want to go. Subordinates often emulate the same behavior as a boss. So while you are working: love your job, show a big smile, help everyone you can, show that you care and everyone around you will soon follow in suit. The power of your mind is an incredible thing. Schwartz finishes his book by quoting Publilius Syrus \\"A wise man will be master of his mind, A fool will be it's slave.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone that wants to do better for themselves in any area of their lives. I hope this opened your mind and if you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask me a question.

0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol hits a literary iceberg and sinks!  Why am I flashing on Nicholas Cage and the movie \\"National Treasure\\" as I read Dan Brown's new mystery thriller The Lost Symbol?  Sadly, This book is simply bad.  No it is terrible!  4 times I stopped reading this mish mash of implausible, incomprehensible drivel.  But I refused to let Mr. Brown win and plowed through to the bitterest of ends-and was not rewarded for my efforts.  What a colossal waste of time.  How someone could write such a fine novel as The Da Vinci Code and then turn out this tripe is utterly amazing.    The plot was marginal, the characters weak, the telling of the story ludicrous.  I wouldn't go any further as I know many people will read this book simply because it was a follow up to his wonderful mega best seller The Da Vinci Code, and I do not want to be a spoiler and ruin what little suspense there is, but let me warn you there's not much there.    Character development was weak to poor.  Mostly implausible.  My favorite character is Inoue Sato, a dried up, old CIA hag who carried much of the book through her abrasiveness.    No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  In fact not much of anything.  Not Recommended.  Save your money.  I cannot even recommend this book as a paperback.  This novel will greatly harm Mr. Brown's literary stature as a novelist.  I expected so much, and he delivered so little.  It will be interesting to see what Mr. Brown does next, and if he can recover any of his Da Vinci Code magic.  Sorry but that's how I see it.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the Shakespeare everyone should be introduced to.  Branagh is faithful, understandable and musical in his delivery. This sacrifices nothing, but tells the gut-wrenching tragedy so every viewer experiences the sorrow and the frustration. The surround-sound of the DVD makes the ghost scenes beyond errie  as Hamlet Sr.'s voice washes around the room. He sounds like he is in front of you, then beside, then behind all within one word.  Geilgud is good in his version, but he allowed the art to eclipse the story. Branagh has found the balance.

0312360266|5.0|I picked up the first copy I could find about a year ago. I admired the creativity of the cover art and decided the price was reasonable as well.. so off I went to read a book that I assumed would be a typical teenage drama. To put it lightly, I was wrong. Mesmerized by the uniqueness of each character, in awe with the information on rituals and in love with how in depth it took me.. I was hooked. I could imagine I was on campus, alongside Zoey Redbird.. living the day to day routine,, and watching paranormal events fall around me. I am awaiting the release of the newest book 'Tempted'.. and know without a doubt that this new addition will leave me gasping and hoping for another. A definite must have for any age, seeing I am 23 now. :)
0385341008|4.0|I read this book to support a co-worker's effort at forming a book club. It was a very quick read--only a few hundred pages, so I finished it in two nights.<br />The narrator's tone is very chipper, and very early 1900's feminist in perspective, but not annoying. The book is a series of letters exchanged between the perky main character and a variety of people who become important to her over time. You get a small taste of some of the darker stories of German occupancy of the British Channel Islands during the war, but not a heavy dose.<br />After my friend's book club has its October meeting, I'll probably post it on the online bookswap site I patronize regularly. I enjoyed the read, but don't see reading it again.

BUTTERFLY: Good song overall but some parts of the song are kind of dull. 4/5     3. MY ALL: Nice song to relax to. 3.5/5     4. THE ROOF: I like the beat of the song. Nice urban feel to it but she whispers a lot. 3.5/5     5. FOURTH OF JULY: Boring. 2/5     6. BREAKDOWN: Pretty good song and the guest rappers aren't even that bad. 4/5     7. BABYDOLL: Cute song but it's not all that. 3/5     9. CLOSE MY EYES: Really boring song and she practially whispers throughout the whole song. Ugh. 1/5     9. WHENEVER YOU CALL: This should have been a single. I love the message of this song and how well she sings it. 5/5     10. FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE): This song sounds like some kind of clubbing song. I kind of like it though. 3/5    11. THE BEAUTIFUL ONES: Annoying song. I personally hate the beat of this song. 1/5     12. OUTSIDE: Some parts of this song are good and some parts are not. 3.5/5       So...I would recommend this album for anyone who wants a relaxing album but if you want a fast paced/up-tempo album then I would pass on this one.
0393035158|1.0|Holy cr@p, Batman, this book is frightening in it's portrayal of Muslims! I don't mean the religion, I mean each & every one of the practicioners. People like Harris would have us round them up & deport them. And/or torture/bomb do whatever else to them Alan Dershowitz recommends. Speaking of The Dersh (one of Harris' buddies, apparently), why is it the third great monotheistic religion doesn't rate a mention in this little tome? Huh, funny that.     It made me chuckle to see Harris briefly mention \\"The tragedy of the Israel-Palestine conflict\\" and then write pages & pages blaming all the problems of the Middle East upon Islam. \\"Nope, no foreign policy failures or occupation or ethnic cleansing of Palestinians here, nothing to see, just move along...\\"
B002KWLUU0|2.0|I want this review to be honest and also to place the Prefab Sprout in its proper context, without the hype (like the New Musical Express placing their Steve McQueen album ridiculously in the top 100 best albums of all time!).  The reality is that the Prefab Sprout was never among the truly greats, those who changed the face of music, the way Soft Machine, The Doors, Nick Cave, or Tim Buckley, did.  Like the Beatles, the Prefab Sprout produced masterful melodies, and their best albums were produced by Thomas Dolby, just as the Beatles relied on George Martin to give their songs those rich arrangements.    Let's Change The World With Music would not be the best album to start with, if you are new to this band.  The best two to start with would be Jordan: The Comeback and Steve McQueen (Two Wheels Good in the United States).  The songs on Let's Change The World were demoed by Paddy, who played all the instruments himself, including employing midi bass and drum sequences, after Jordan: The Comeback, in the hope of creating the latter's successor.  However, the A&R department of his label thought these songs were not quite up to the usual Prefab Sprout standards and were too religious lyrically for mass appeal.  This was devastating to a songwriter such as Paddy McAloon who has tended to write songs at such a furious pace that his greatest struggle is losing the inpiration and motivation to record them all.  An A&R employee even encouraged him to write an album themed around the song Earth: The Story So Far, which appears on this album, and is indeed one of its brightest gems, so he went off and wrote 30 songs on that very theme - another album that has yet to see the light, if it ever does, given Paddy is now 52 years old and the Sprout are basically over as a band, Wendy Smith (breathy co-vocalist) and Martin McAloon (his bass playing brother) both holding down full-time jobs, and drummer Neil Conti residing and working in France.    Paddy McAloon produced an excellent solo album probably called I Trawl The Megahertz - its first lengthy track is one of Paddy's masterpieces.  His best song is actually Pearly Gates, the last song on another compilation of demos that came out between Steve McQueen and Jordan: The Comeback.  This new album is therefore not new - it was recorded around 1992, and so it still has that \\"80s\\" sound when Michael Jackson (about whom Paddy apparently wrote another album's worth of songs) and Prince were still riding the airwaves.      There are a few songs on this collection of demos that are almost as good as Paddy's best - Let There Be Music, Music Is A Princess, Earth: The Story So Far, and Sweet Gospel Music.  The others are reminiscent of the poorer tracks on the Sprout's poorest album, From Langley Park to Memphis (whose King Of Rock'N'Roll, and Cars and Girls in particular, were hands-down McAloon treasures).  The songs on this album are practically all about the magic of music, and the spiritual feelings it elicits.  It is not exactly a religious album, in the sense of a Christian rock album that mentions Jesus in every breath.  If this album is religious, it is non-denominational, with the power to appeal to, and in rare moments even move, most feeling beings.    But this album also makes one feel sad as a fan.  One realizes that Paddy's frantic work style (which has apparently abated considerably in recent years in which he has become a family man raising three children) also led him to write songs that are so similar to the others, that approach a type of McAloon formula.  My sadness is that which arises when contemplating unrealized potential.  Could it be his obsessive personality interfered with his artistic ability?  The Sprouts are not a Nico, a Syd Barrett, a Lisa Germano, a Jefferson Airplane, a Minutemen - they were not trying to stretch any envelopes, they were too in love with the pop music of a Sondheim or a Paul McCartney or a Chic (whose Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers he mentions in the song I Love Music) or a Michael Jackson.  They aimed mostly at writing pop, and that is what we find on this album, and what you must expect if you are interested in trying it out.    Nonetheless, it sure is great to hear Paddy's voice once more, and eery to remember that it is him singing at the much younger age of 35!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I love this kind of  a book; but this was a total dissapointment.I am glad I now have a kindle and only paid the kindle edition price, even this, may I ask for a refund? I have never done this before as reading is my passion and I have certain respect for the writer and his product,but this book is REALLY bad,I feel I needed to warn fellow readers. If you must,just get it out of the library and by the way when is the release date for this feature on kindle?
B00006CXXU|5.0|I usually like Mariah Carey more but I love this album. It shows how much she has improved as an artist. And her songs have great meanings to them. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Well, it's been 14 years since the release of the selftitled, and we all know what happened that day when Layne Staley (RIP) died of a speedball overdose, and everyone, including myself, thought that Alice in Chains was done for, Jerry Cantrell doing solo albums (which are also good), but Alice in Chains is not done it seems, this is a refreshing release, I always wanted another Alice in Chains album, and now we have it, and it pleases me.    William Duvall (Staleys replacement) does a STELLAR job of filling really big shoes, as his vocals fit the Alice in Chains sound, I was skeptical at first, then when I heard \\"A Looking In View\\" that skepticism passed, a great replacement.    Now I gave this album 5 stars obviously because the music is so awesome, but the packaging....well, that leaves much to be desired, you'll know what I mean when you see it, but I'm not rating the packaging.    5 stars all the way, keep releasing albums Alice in Chains!
0307269752|5.0|I used to read more mysteries than I do now and I am so glad that I picked up a copy of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This is a hard review to write as I don't want to give too much away as to spoil the story for those who haven't read the book yet. This book has a slow start, a few friends warned me that the first 150 pages would be slow and it was. It was filled with lots of information but I still found it interesting and wasn't tempted to put it down. So, if you're reading it and find the beginning slow...don't give up, it gets SO much better!<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was truly spellbinding to me...it pulled me in and I couldn't put the book down near the end. This book covers it all including murder mystery, family sagas, family secrets, love story and financial intrigue and mystery. There are several story lines within the book that I didn't have a problem balancing as I read. There is the storyline of Mikael a political and financial journalist who is charged with Libel. He runs and co-owns a magazine called Millenium, thus the series is referred to as the Millenium series. Mickael is hired to investigate a missing person case and the woman has been missing for over 40 years.<br /><br />My favorite storyline and character is Lisbeth a twenty-something pierced and tattooed young woman with a horrible past full of secrets. She is intriguing and mysterious and her mind works at a genius level including her computer hacking abilities. Her social skills are limited and this causes her a lot of problems. Her past gets intertwined into the story as she teams up with Mikael to help him solve the missing person case.<br /><br />There are definitely disturbing parts to this book that are graphic in nature so be forewarned if this is something that bothers you. I usually don't tolerate graphic abuse very well and there are definitely squeamish and violent scenes in this book but the storyline was so amazing and intelligent that these dark aspects didn't destroy my opinion of the book . There was a lot of violence towards women in this book and it seemed excessive. The ugly side of human nature shines through loudly. I can understand why the title was originally called \\"Men who hate women\\" when it was first published in Sweden.on of the book .

0547258305|5.0|This book is surprisingly good for the author's first debut book.  Like many have said, it mixes in perfectly some elements of realism with fantasy.  The story was very well written and I fell in love with Katsa, the main character, instantly.  There is a bit of romance but it is done so perfectly that it isn't over bearing or gives off a sense of lacking.  All in all, I will keep this review short because all I need to say about this book is very few words:  It is a unique book whose story is different from what you have ever read or seen in movies.  It has set up a whole new idea on how I perceive fantasy-type books and will change yours as well.    Check this book out, you won't be disappointed!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I actually like this CD. Sure it might some bad songs in it but overall its a good cd.
0307266303|5.0|Excellent book and great history on some fascinating ultrarunners. Amazing descriptions and of events and people.
0696204800|5.0|You know, she doesn't speak a word of english, but the pictures in this book are so nice, and it has so many samples of nice work, that she was able to reproduce some of them by herself, even without being able to read the instructions. Surely it was a good choice.
0385504225|5.0|I have been a big fan of Dan Brown since The Da Vinci Code.  I made a point of reading his earlier works, all of which I found interesting and thought provoking.  I have awaited release of The Lost Symbol, since hearing that it was forthcoming.  I pre-ordered the book for my Kindle and after receiving it, I really hated putting it down.  Unfortunately for me, my days are fairly busy and my reading is relegated to late evening just before retiring for the night.  I usually read for about one hour, but I had difficulty keeping to that schedule, since I didn't want to stop.  The story grabbed me right from the start and didn't want to let go.  I have read some of the other reviews that were critical of what the reviewers referred to as slow or unnecessary portions of the book.  Perhaps those reviews have some merit, but overall, I found the book to be well written and spellbinding.  Perhaps the best thing about the book is that it is set here in familiar surroundings.  I have been in or around many of the buildings described in the book, and I can't wait to get back to Washington D.C., to explore these locations again
B002JM1VJG|1.0|I was so happy to see this release when it was first announced.  Finally, a bunch of the videos that have been missing from the previously releases are going to finally be on an official dvd.  When I got the package, I hurried to open it and watch it and boy was I in for a big let down.  The video quality is awful, really really awful.  I had to look at the cover again to see if this was a 2 vcd set or something.  How could a release from a big company and a major artist be so bad?  As the previous reviewer mentioned, they should have released a two dvd set and not have compressed this.  This is an item that's going to be bought worldwide by collectors expecting a great dvd collection and they will all be really disappointed.  I am especially disappointed because since this collection is quite inclusive of a lot of her videos, I think this will be the last Madonna dvd collection.  What a big time bummer about the quality!!!  I can't return it so it's just going into my collection as a piece of junk.
B001NESPHC|5.0|It's hard to believe that this is only Gardot's second full-length release, particularly when compared against the squawky, piano-driven, home-demo debut EP that preceded last year's awesome Worrisome Heart.  Produced by the venerable Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell's ex), My One and Only Thrill is all mood, all noir, all whispers in the night.  From the first string-laden strains of \\"Baby I'm a Fool,\\" Gardot evokes Peggy Lee, Billie Holiday, and Astrud Gilberto in one breath.  Much of the material is themed on longing, offset by bits of Braziliana.  Titles like \\"Who Will Comfort Me,\\" \\"Lover Undercover,\\" \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" and \\"Your Heart Is as Black as Night\\" suggest a set awash in self-pity, but Gardot's delicate delivery makes everything okay.  And her second, orchestral take on \\"If the Stars Were Mine\\" leaves you looking up.
0060526491|3.0|While I did enjoy it, please try and find it at a better price than 19 dollars, the one I got from amazon was 7.98(for hardcover and new!) and I think it was a good deal. You will zip through it quickly since the stories/poems are short but there are about 20 or so of them in there, and while not my favorite book I will gloss over it every few months or so and still continue to keep it in my collection.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|\\"Dirty Dancing\\" has always held a special place in the hearts of its audience ever since it was released in 1987, but perhaps with the death of Patrick Swayze in 2009 from cancer, the movie holds an even deeper place in those that know and love the film. One of the biggest hits from the late '80's ( the film has grossed so far 213 million dollars), \\"Dirty Dancing\\" stars Jennifer Grey (Joel Grey's daughter) as a young girl who falls in love with a good-looking dance instructor (played by Swayze) in 1963 much to the chagrin of her father. The movie is notable for its amazing soundtrack and the fact it won the Academy Award that year for Best song for \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\". The film would be the first ever sell a million copies on home video. Kenny Ortega, most famous now for choreographing \\"High School Musical\\", got his start in \\"Dirty Dancing\\" creating the dance steps. This deluxe 2 disc 20th Anniversary Edition is filled with bonuses including extended and deleted scenes, audio commentary, videos, and original screen tests.
1878424505|5.0|This work is a must read for everyone who can read or listen or for those who take care of those who cannot.  The principles are basic to our everyday lives, and if followed, allow us freedom to be our authentic proactive selves rather than reactive sufferers. The presentation is simplistic, but profound in its wisdom of four agreements with ourselves that set us up for success.  I recommend it to my clients.

B0014NDXGA|5.0|This product is easy to use and extremely accurate. It is my new best friend on the golf course.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|I waited TEN YEARS for these videos to be released on DVD, and now feel shafted. What were they thinking? The video is disgraceful for 2009. The 5.1 soundtrack is pathetic. These are landmark videos and should be treated with the respect this artist deserves. Instead we have lousy sound, awful picture 'quality' and an edited version of one of her most beloved songs. Who in the world ordained Warners to be my censor?!    To edit art is fascism! May Warners burn in the flames of consumer damnation.    If I could've rated it 0 stars I would have. Save your money folks and DEMAND a remaster!
B002QNGKGW|1.0|I have really enjoyed the show, and am a regular viewer. This episode was a joke, however, as so much of the dialogue was blanked out. It was like listening to a really bad cell phone connection.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Playing for Change is not just one of those feel-good productions. It is so much more than that.Through the medium of music we are united into a shared brotherhood, no matter our race, culture, nationality,religion or appearance.This cd-dvd is a celebration of our shared humanity. Watching and listening,no matter how many times, is as good as the first time. This production is skillfully constructed and is a one those rare jewels that you can't part with. I recommend this product for your  music/video collection. It would also make a great gift for anyone and everyone and for any and all occasions.So share the joy!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I truly love this CD. I am not a musical expert so I will not comment on the technical aspects of the music. Instead I feel as though Muse is telling a story. This CD seems like it was made for an adventure movie - a movie that has not been  produced yet. Muse creates art not just music.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The content, performance and video and audio production values on this DVD are absolutely top notch even though it is in standard 480p. I own more than 50 music DVDs and have previewed many many more. For my generation (Baby Boomers)it does not get better than this!
B002POMLHY|5.0|Been a Breaking Benjamin fan since the first album and was really excited for this long overdue album to come out.  Same distinctive sound that is very addicting.  Great album and a must buy for any Breaking Benjamin fan or semi-fan.
B00275EHCI|3.0|SURROGATES depicts a near-future world where people choose to remain in their homes for safety, interacting with the world through android bodies known as surrogates. The surrogates are not only designed to look better than the actual humans, but any damage to the surrogate has no effect on the owner, who only has to buy a new surrogate. That's until someone creates a weapon that can not only destroy surrogates, but fry the brains of their operators as well. Bruce Willis stars as agent Tom Greer, an FBI agent who must get to the bottom of the first such murder.<br /><br />This is a fairly standard mix of police procedural with car chances and occasional (but never gratuitous) special effects moments. In spite of its 85 minutes, the film seems rushed, and I expected more fleshing out of the environment of 2017. The end is especially disappointing in this regard, with the credits rolling only a couple of minutes after the climax of the film, with the briefest of resolution. The look of the future seems greatly inspired by MINORITY REPORT, and it's a pity nothing more distinctive was done.<br /><br />What does make this film an enjoyable romp, however, are the social themes it addresses. A group of humans who reject the use of surrogates has an important role in this film, and it makes one think about the upheavals in store if futurists like Ray Kurzweil are right about the coming singularity.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|Truly the only reason I bought the album is because it was only $4 and my girlfriend likes them.  If I didn't like it then at least I knew she would.  I actually was not disappointed, the album is not that bad.  I'm not in love with it, but its good.  I say its worth $4 for sure, that is if this is the type of music you are into.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Very entertaining, funny, original. Once you start watching the episodes is imposible to stop at just one a day. Great writers and actors. Every detail is perfect. The best show on TV.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|If you like to watch movies that are full of love, chaos, nature, english accents, ballroom dancing and horse and carriages then this is a good movie to see. When I  stumbled upon this movie I was entranced; I am now a Jane Austen fan.<br />Watching Pride & Prejudice, for the first time, I can't help but want to steer the characters in the right path and want to be Elizabeth Bennetts friend and help her along in finding love with dear Mr.Darcy.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|If you love Guitar then you have to have this in your music Collection....period. The first time I heard this song I was hooked on Trower..I have seen him over 30 times in the last 30 years. All the Classics are on this album...what else could be said, one of the all time great guitar masterpieces of our time.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|I saw this movie last night and like it fairly well. However it did remind me of another movie which I thought was a lot more exciting. If you haven't ever seen the cult classic mother's day then you won't know what I'm talking about. Both movies involve scenes of rape and torture, but I think mothers day doesn't take it too seriously and that is what makes it more watchable. I haven't seen the '72 version so I can't compare these two films. Also the only person I think that would enjoy the rape scenes are someone like Ted Bundy or the Hillside Stranglers. I guess they get the intended reaction in making you want to go beat every rapist in the world with a ball bat until their eyeballs pop out so I guess the director and writer can be commended for this powerful involving horror fest.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Theory of a Deadman is a pretty reputable artist, and they supposedly sound like Nickelback, but I guess they can sometimes. Anyway, they have a good guitar and drummer, and the lyrics are the good reason people are interested in this artist. Some of the best songs are the ones that express the most story, and the singles always on the radio, like \\"Bad Girlfriend\\", \\"So Happy\\", and  \\"Hate my Life\\". Although, there are still good songs there. However, the whole album is not worthwhile, but it is worth a listen, and when I say that, it's that some people will wanna by it and other peoples wont, because the whole album is not worthy, and that's why I'm giving it four stars. The voice has changed, but overall, their lyrics are still good in the old and new.
0440237688|3.0|The writer has a high opinion of herself. In my opinion. She tried too hard to condense a surrel idea tightly between the covers of a short novel. There are questions left unanswered at the end and for Lowry to say in the interview that it is \\"up to the reader to decide\\" is confirmation of the fact that she has no idea herself what the ending is. Being esoteric and mysterious is not the answer. To live like they did in the story takes fear,(flying a plane), love (bringing up a child) and anger (bringing up a child). Ludicrous to think such tasks are impossible without the associated emotions. For a start.<br />At the end, he glides through the snow towrds the light and the music. I think it is here where Lowry's ego crashes.
B001NFNFF8|5.0|I orginally saw this movie on Netflix, watched it and then bought it from Amazon.  In addition to being a Tommy Lee Jones fan, I really enjoyed this story as it brought the Dave Robicheaux character and environment to life.  Even though I had read the book, I had to watch the video three times to get all of the story's nuances.  Also, if you have the option, I suggest you view this in Blu Ray, as the scenery is excellent.   John Goodman is well cast and as someone else observed, would have made a good Clete Percel.  The only caution is if you are not familiar with James Lee Burke and his imperfect Robicheaux character, this will only appear to be another detective story.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie was brilliant. i saw it in theaters and loved it, so i thought it would only be right to purchase it in the finest quality available.  Great choice, although this movie does not have too many scenes like planet earth that absolutely need 1080p, it still is a great way to watch an amazing film.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The Playstation controller has always been a favorite of mine as it kept with the traditional SNES controller format, while adding new functionality of additional buttons and the analog sticks. While I'm not too crazy about the SIXAXIS or the analog buttons that came about during the PS2 area (mostly since almost NO ONE used them), it was a standard controller that was very comfortable to me.<br /><br />Right now I think the Playstation Dual Shock series has the best d-pad out there right now. The buttons don't stick out enough and each direction is separated, making it easier to make sure you're going in the direction you want to, not accidentally going in a random diagonal. Compare to the horrible X-Box and Dreamcast d-pads, which made playing fighting games or directional sensitive ones so very painful. The addition of the built-in Bluetooth wireless with the induction of the PS3 is the icing on the cake with this controller.<br /><br />Now, the biggest problem with this control is the \\"triggers\\" for the L2 and R2 shoulder buttons. What's the deal with this? It doesn't make using a gun in a game more real, nor does it make playing the game any more efficient. In fact, it actually reduces reaction ability as it actually takes effort to push the button down, so in a situation (i.e. a fighting game) where you need to hit many buttons quickly, the amount of pressure and time it takes (although very minimal) actually breaks up the flow one might have when playing. And, with the lack of analog button support, you may not even be pressing the button if you're only putting a little pressure on it. This comes back and bites you in the add two fold since it takes a bit more pressure to keep the whole thing down, and letting up just a bit of pressure causes the button to not be active any longer (I can't even count how many times I got killed in Devil Summoner 2 because I wasn't putting my guard up when I was clearly pushing down on R2). Ever since Trigger style buttons were implemented from the SEGA Saturn on, this has been one of the most confusing and frustrating additions to a standard controller I've seen.<br /><br />I still think this is the best controller that Sony has put out because of the wireless support and the familiar set-up, which trumps the horrible trigger shoulder buttons that this controller sports and makes it my current second favorite controller of this generation (next to the Wii-mote and Nunchuck set-up). I can't ever give this controller a full five stars, however, unless they remove those god-awful triggers or someone releases a controller mod that makes them like the original PS1/Dual Shock style shoulder buttons.<br /><br />It's important to note, though, that you can probably spend a little less money by getting the original SIXAXIS controller without rumble in it, assuming you can live without the rumble. I personally can, but the added weight of the Dual Shock rumble motors actually gives the controller a little bit of weight and makes the controller feel a little more comfortable.om the SEGA Saturn on, this has been one of the most confusing and frustrating additions to a standard controller I've seen.

B002CAWNEM|5.0|This is the first movie I seen with Beyonce Knowles in it. I think she did a real good job. The movie was suspenseful and a little obvious since there are many movies out there with the same theme. Ali Larter gave a good performance as the obsessive tempt. It's worth watching at least once.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|Don't be fooled by all the five star ratings!  I have been a huge AIC fan since they first began, and this CD just doesn't hold up.  I am certainly not comparing the CD with their older material 100%  As others have said, that's impossible.  But, even if this was a totally new band, I would have to give it a \\"C\\".  The new singer, William DuVall, is excellent, both as an imitator of Layne and as a voice unto himself, but the music is just not there.  The album just drones along with nothing really standing out (except maybe \\"Check my Brains\\").  I wonder if these 5 star raters have ever really listened to Facelift or Dirt.  Where are the tracks like \\"Man in a Box\\", \\"Real Thing\\", \\"Angry Chair\\"?  You know, those songs that have the signature AIC sound but have a driving tempo and catchy vocal melodies?  When I want AIC to slow down and get into their \\"gloomy\\" sound, I want to hear \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" not \\"Take Her Out.\\"     I just don't believe in getting all hyped up about an album just because it's AIC and just because it's been so long since they released an album.  They have a great new singer, and it's just a shame that they can't do any better than this.  Let's be honest, Layne or no, this album just does not cut it.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Since my two most fav. actresses, Penelope Cruz and Scarlet Johansson, were in this movie there was no way I was going to pass the movie up. I enjoyed it fully. The narration flowed smoothly throughout the film and the acting was good.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  The picture quality was very good and quite pleasant to watch even though knowing there was a crop from the original version to make it wide screen.  The picture clairty more than made up for the crop and I doubt if one could argue that it made a substantial difference as far as cinematic impact was concerned.  I've seen both and most certainly prefer the blu-ray widescreen to the original format.  Although the audio was ok, I thought it could have been better, if so, I would have rated this movie 5 stars.  The sound seemed shrill at times and a bit indistinct in certain areas with the background too much in front.    All the actors did a fine job. Duvall is such a believable charcter that seems so authentic for the time period portrayed.  I cannot imagine any other actor topping Duvalls performance for his role.  Tommy lee Jones was quite impressive as well.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I really enjoyed the original 1972 Last House on the Left. I wasn't surprised when I saw the preview for this remake. A lot of the movies that been coming out are remakes of old films or films from Japan and Korea. Anyway, I wanted to see Last House because I was curious how it would be in comparison to the original.<br />I liked the movie. Good acting and it kept me on the edge of my seat. It's cool how Sara Paxton went from a movie like Aquamarine to a movie like this.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|If I had only known before I bought both sets I would have bought the mono box set and select stereo albums.<br />Simply put, on mono they sound like a BAND !!!!<br />I could have never guessed I would be this excited.<br />If you can, start with the first album and listen in order... the growth from album to album will amaze you and in such a short time span. When you think how long it takes for people/groups to put out one album today... and all of this music in 7 short years. WOW !
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I'm a 19 year old dude... and I really liked the movie. Honestly for some reason, I like Miley Cyrus in General. Her alter ego Hanna I could care less about, so I'm glad the movie featured more of Miley. Anyway, I seen some of the Hanna Montana episodes so i knew who everybody was. A lot of the movie was predictable but it didn't take the fun out of it.I loved the shoe fight scene with Trya Banks in the beginning. That was really funny. The songs I enjoyed and I knew from the start that her song \\"The Climb\\" would be the main song. In general the movie was fun and enjoyable.

0061767581|3.0|First, I was surprised the book was decent and readable. Great literature? Absolutely not. But, it was fun, and short. Although no writing contributor is named it seemed to me that Conrad had some help writing the book. The book is basicially the story of 'The Hills' tv show - with names being altered to protect - well, to guard against lawsuits probably. The book shows (through fictionalized characters) how the girls are cast and then filmed and the small 'problems' that come with being filmed a majority of the time. Most of the 'problems' they encounter are because their love lives are edited to show certain scenarios and the girls' friendships erode when they believe one is becoming more famous than the other. Jealousy and backstabbing and boyfriends. That's the book, in a nutshell. It's a very quick and easy read and, while it won't win awards, it's ok for a long flight or a rainy day. The characters are so one-dimensional you'll forget them the minute you put the book down. In fact, I read this book just last week and caanot recall a single character name. It just doesn't have any staying power; the characters are poorly written and don't do anything significant. But, I heard it was already optioned into a movie.
0871137380|5.0|Mr. Bowden acknowledges up front that this work is not an assessment of judgments or actions. He is forthright in his statement that he would leave the political and social debates out of the pages of his book and would only offer an intimate, unabashed account of what warfare is like through the eyes (and minds) of the soldiers who fight. Bravo Mr. Bowden for not leaving one scent, one whisper, one fear out of this account. The dogs of war and the peace pipers alike should read this horrific account before they offer their protests for or against the soldiers who are doing little more than following the orders of their political leaders. War is Hell, nothing more, nothing less. Not even Dante' could have survived the battle of Mogadishu without throwing his sanity aside.    John
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Wonderful movie. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are great as so   are the songs the perform. Loved the message abour pursuing one's  dreams no matter the obstacles.Very nice to watch enjoying good   company and a bottle of wine.  Still, I paid for two-day delivery and didn't get it on time.  I haven't receive a refund from Amazon, as promised on it's   delivery waranty.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|First things first. I have been a solid fan of AIC since I first heard Man in the Box in middle school. I also enjoyed Mad Season and both Jerry solo efforts. So my only stab here is that this new AIC album, Black Gives Way to Blue, is that it's obviously just a 3rd Jerry Cantrell solo album that happens to have 2 former AIC members on board, yet hidden in the background. Read on if you would like to know a full circle review of the new record... hozzles.    Track 1(All Secrets Known) is a welcome reminder of good chains sound, though is a bit too slow and literally goes no where. I felt this song needed a lot more than what was settled on to be the lead off to a potential beast of a come back album, but still ends up one of the best songs on the album by far after a second or third listen.    The second track (Check My Brain) I believe is the radio single (I have no idea since me and the radio got divorced about 10 years ago.) and man does it miss the mark by a mile. I feel the lyrics are cheesey and it's just more of a album filler than an actual lead off come back single. When I think of AIC singles this one is dead last for sure. Sorry, Jerry, but what? And it only gets worse...    I would have to say that track 3 (Last of My Kind) is by far the most horrible song ever to carry the name AIC. You could fight me on it, but seriously, it's that bad. (Unfortunately it's one of the only songs that wasn't fully written by Mr. Cantrell too, so that's a bit frightening.) I think I can't get over the fact that this track directly rips off the chorus of Dragula by Rob Zombie, though replaces his words with terrible terrible Cantrelly lyrics. Sooo disappointed in this song, but didn't hate it enough to tear apart the whole album, just the afterthought that this seemed finished to them? Hopefully it will grow on me, but man, I just don't know at this point.    I really enjoyed track 4 (Your Decision) Seemed very Sap/Jar of Flies worthy and my only problem with it is that itnever goes anywhere. Once it starts you get the feeling of Alice in Chains for sure. Now had William come in stronger over Jerry's voice the song could have really made it's mark. This song feels full and finished though, not quite so demo as the others. The guitar is excellent in this song as Jerry continues to remind us of that throughout the album.    I thought Track 5 (A Looking In View) was close to amazing and as I was listening to it I thought \\"Man, this is what AIC should sound like in today's music industry!\\" But then the song just went on and on and never ever seemed to end then it started all over again, WTF? Was the producer scared to say ANYTHING to Jerry and the gang here? Seemed so. But everything here in this song aside from the fact that it shouldn't have restarted itself in the middle makes a good Alice In Chains jam for sure.    Track 6 (When the sun rose again) is obviously trying to reach back to Jar of Flies, but has a strong interruption into Degradation Trip that is however welcome, though the song also goes no where making it boring in the end, such a waste of potential. Great use of harmonizing between William and Jerry, but just too much Jerry voice, I'm sorry. I know you are the last remaining voice of Alice in Chains, but if you need to be heard so much now then why even have William at all, dude? Let the poor guy out of the wood shed so he can sing a few lines! Either way, nice guitar and music for sure. The lyrics are really awesome though. I just feel like at this point in the album, anything Jerry is singing sounds exactly the same.    Track 7 (Acid bubble) definitely has that AIC feel to it and was refreshing at this point in the album but almost too late to attempt to save it. If this song could have been sped up some more, maybe given a little Facelift jam or even Dirt feel to it, it would have been awesome and not just feel like a Degradation Trip outtake. Now I will say that the guitar jam and vocal chant in the middle and endare awesome and I almost wish the song started right there. But since the 2 parts of the song are such bi-polar opposites they goof the song up when put together, which reminds me of why Degradation Trip 2 disc edition was such a overall iffy failure. Look, I'm not 'stuck in the past' or condemning the band for trying different things and not clinging to what's been done by them, so get over that assumption. All I'm saying is that you put any of their albums up next to each other and this obviously feels less focused on even musically with or without Layne Staley. Okay, back to the review that's as long as the album's feel.    Track 8 (Lessons Learned) should have been the opening track, but it would have made anyone listening automatically say, \\"Hey, another Jerry solo album.\\" But it is such a good Degradation Trip/Boggy Depot feeling kind of song that it could have almost shown up on Three Legged Dog or a soundtrack (like the 2 badass AIC songs on the Last Action Hero soundtrack - Little Bitter & What the Hell Have I are unbelievable and amazing non album songs). Lessons Learned saves this album from being forgettable in a month from now.    Track 9 (Take her out) was another that I listened to more than the others. I like the idea behind it, musically and lyrically, though have trouble seeing it as an AIC song, or more like where it fits with AIC? It's just way too Jerry or even something else, and honestly not that great, but good for this album, especially the music side of it. Ultimately, just another semi-boring song on the album sad to say, but good enough to be a selected track pulled out of the album's mess.    Track 10 (Private Hell) is a good AIC type song. It begs from Rain When I Die and Nutshell a bit too much (maybe even the Dirt song) so in that I feel the AIC vibe very very strong on this song and in so I ALMOST love it, but after a few listens instead end up realizing it's just okay and goes on too long for not being a great enough song capable of5 minutes. Great guitar solo and feels like an early 90's song for sure.    The title track to me is just odd and in no way is anything of the AIC name. I just don't feel it yet maybe, but it's boring though pretty, a little lame and surprisingly short, closing off an album that to me is just too slow and repetitive even for a Jerry solo project.    I have forced myself to listen to (hate to say it like that) this album about six times now. My final decision is that it's just too slow, every song resembles each other too much or another Chains song too much, and Jerry obviously intended on this to be his next solo album considering he wrote 95% of the album himself, but using a name from the past to push record sales. Whoops.    Now I've seen William live back in 01 and heard him sing some amazing covers of AIC with Jerry back then. This guy is a wicked vocalist but you wouldn't even know he's on this album. So disappointing and for every one vocal track of William, we get 3 Jerry vocal tracks that harmonize with each other over his. That may have worked with Layne on Three Legged Dog on a few songs, but obviously Jerry wants to be heard more on this album. Layne, as I've come to realize over the years of his absence, had a voice that just came out and existed. Then Jerry would harmonize around it, making it awesome. That's why it worked, and was such a refreshing and addictive sound. Maybe live Jerry will hold off more, but somehow I doubt it.    Jerry needs to be Jerry with a band. Mike and Sean add close to nothing (I am so disappointed for ever having to say that) to this project other than the fact that when they tour they will be able to play old AIC songs for the crowd's appeasement as AIC minus Layne and not Jerry with some band no one really knows. The songs are all written out seemingly effortlessly, though the filler and overlaying tracks of guitars are nice, which worries me on why it was even done. I'm not saying that Sean and Mike contributed a TON ofwriting material to the other albums, but it's almost like they aren't even here compared to other albums. I listen to Facelift and every instrument stands out, every vocal track stands out, it's amazing. Dirt is the same way and Three Legged Dog is where it gets a little hazey, but with songs like Head Creeps and Frogs who the bacon cares, they are amazing in their own and showcase the individual members for sure. This album will never stand up to even Three Legged Dog in my opinion and thus will always be that long awaited Jerry solo follow up to Degradation Trip that didn't quite cut the mustard beans...    On a final note... it's almost like the whole time I was listening to it I felt like I was listening to songs in their early stages of formation. This makes me wonder if the producers of the AIC albums of past had more of a hand in the writing and structuring of the songs we know and love. That scares me and I'd rather not believe it. Instead I'd Dan Rather believe that there was either pressure from the record label or just anxiety and fear from Jerry and the gang going into this to make it right and dropped the ball some. Who knows, but it's an overall okay album, good to hear something of this style so late in the middle of the age of mostly terrible, recycled music and we'll just have to see what happens next, if anything at all.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I saw this series on regular dvd a while ago. It was still fabulous! On Blu-Ray and even a 720p HDTV it is absolutely astonding! The content is mostly shot with hi-def cameras and what a visual treat it is! I will not repeat what has already been said already about this exceptional documentery. My suggestion is to start with the episode 'Fresh water\\"-- the footage of Angel Falls will leave you speechless!
1416550542|4.0|a very sweet book, with tinges of victorian era events, part charles dickens, part jane eyre, related to \\"the thirteenth tale\\", lots of english scenes, turn of the century and contemporary.....very well written, not on the highest level of writing but very nice. a book about books and the stories that mean so much to us, to those of us who love books and started out loving them as small children. a long book but lots of interest to carry it along.
0765317389|3.0|The star rating system is a bit problematic here, since I have yet to read the book.  However, I wanted everyone to be careful when buying this product.  Based on how Amazon lists it, it looks like it is all 4 books of the \\"Ender Quartet\\", rather than just the first one.  The name should actually read: \\"Ender's Game Gift Edition (Ender Quartet-Book 1).
B001AQMBKA|5.0|I am already a devoted fan of Lost so I knew what I was getting into when I bought the second season. The picture and sound is crisp and clear. I love the season play feature which allows you to return to the same place on the disc even if you take the disc out of the player. I haven't watched any of the extras yet, and probably won't so I can't comment on that.
1595141979|5.0|Never before have I had such an emotional connection to literary figures.  I have never cried before while reading a book until this one, my heart even broke a little bit, but I could not suppress the emotions the author could convey.      Richelle Mead has an uncharacteristic writing style that entices the reader into bonding with the characters in this story and leaves us wanting more.   The character development over the course of the series is phenomenal.    I started the series and read all 4 books that have been published within a week, I am completely, 100%, no questions asked, absolutely hooked and in love with this series (especially Dimitri).  I cannot wait until the 5th book comes out next year, and hope that the anticipation does not kill me.      Hands down the best series I have ever read.
0061120081|5.0|I bought the 1st edition, 1st printing of Harper Perennial Modern Classics' \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" that was signed by Harper Lee.  At first, I thought I had maybe been scammed because the book was in such good condition, but it was the real thing!  I gave it to my sister for her 22nd birthday (it's her favorite book and she's never owned a copy) and the look on her face when she saw that signature was utter disbelief!  she actually started shaking she was so amazed!  I think it actually trumped the new car my folks gave her!  Thank you, Keene Books, for a priceless reaction that I will NEVER forget, and at such a reasonable cost!
141654917X|4.0|I would recommend this as a good read to anyone. It is a descriptive read and glance into a family's life with a daughter/sister who has leukemia. Not only is the story about the life of the sister, Kate, but about how her cancer affects the entire family, including the mother, father, sister, and brother. Kate's sister, Anna, is suing her parents for medical emancipation so she does not have to donate anymore blood, bone marrow, or her kidney to her dying sister. The book goes over the course of the trial, but glimpses back into each one of the family members lives to tell you about their past and how they have become who they are today. Not only do you get glimpses of the family's life but also into Anna's lawyer, and his love interest, which was an interesting part of the story as well. I found the book very intriguing and didn't want to set it down. I did not see the end of the story coming... I did not expect it to end as it did. It was such a surprise for me I cried and cried the whole last chapter of the book! The book not only represents a family's love, but even more, a sister's love. This book was very emotional for me and I do not have a sister, I would imagine having a sister and reading this book would make it even more emotional. This book is definitely worth reading.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|First thing is first.....I NEVER write reviews but do rely on them when purchasing something. Here it is....Breaking Benjamin's fourth album.  This album is the best yet....fantastic!  Not one bad track on the entire album.  If you are a Breaking Benjamin fan this is a must have album! This album was well worth the wait.  Breaking Benjamin are second to none!!!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|If the only reason you buy this special edition of Gandhi is to view a nine-minute featurette on the filming of Gandhi's funeral, then you will have spent your money well.

0385504225|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I admire Dan Brown (or any author capable of being published for that matter), and that I was completely captivated by this story for the past week and a half!  Then, all of the sudden - once the bad guys were revealed, and the day was saved - I noticed that there was another 50-60 pages to go!!  Unfortunately, there was little that interested me in those final pages, so when I finally finished I felt like the read wasn't nearly as pleasurable as it actually was.    Basically, I loved this story right up until the climax - I literally couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  Then, when the storyline was wrapped up, the story turned into a boring/silly lesson on history and religion.  It's a shame because I couldn't tell enough people about how much I loved my new book - and now when people ask, I just won't portray the same enthusiasm.  It's definetely worth a read, just expect DB to do his thing and write way too much dialogue!!!
0385504225|3.0|In this review I don't plan to compare this new Brown book with THE BOOK.  Rather, I want to add a long-time Washingtonian's reactions to this much anticipated volume set in the nation's capital.  For those who like secret codes, hidden clues, incomprehensible cryptic charts and other Brown specialities, you will not be disappointed. While not much goes on in the first 70 pages or so, at that point the book takes off and becomes a real page turner. There is a lot of information to internalize, but the book ain't dull.  Brown generally does a good job on his Washington geography and folkways, but there are some exceptions:  Metro stations do not serve Amtrak; Metro trains do not have conductors; it would be impossible to land a copter in Dupont Circle park due to the trees. The CIA I believe is still foreclosed by law from taking actions within the U.S.--none of the Chiefs of the Capitol Hill police we have had would prostrate themselves to the CIA, especially not on their own turf. As a Kalorama resident, I found Brown's setting of an important part of the story in \\"Kalorama Heights\\" to be fun, but I think he was on the wrong side of Connecticut Avenue and really meant Kalorama. But I learned some things from the book, especially about the interior of the Capitol and the art present in the building, and enough about the Masons to last me a lifetime. I also will never look at some familiar buildings the same way again.    Brown also educated me on abstruse concepts like \\"universal consciousness\\" and \\"noetic science.\\"  The guy supplements his fantastic imagination with substantial research--no wonder he ran two years over his deadline.  I do think there are a few too many subplots; and the big surprise knocked me flat even though it was really stretching things. There are plenty of cryptic charts to keep the interested busy for a while--the book is well put together.  But Brown has committed my one \\"sin to be avoided at all costs.\\"  Several of his characters act in such a dumb fashion, oblivious to the most obvious warning signs, that it drives me up the wall (yes, Katherine, I am talking about you!). Nonetheless, a worthy successor volume to THE BOOK which stands alone quite nicely on its own. Enjoy!
0385504225|1.0|I read the whole book and was sorry I wasted my time. Yes there are a lot of symbols and a 'big' mystery. The problem is (warning spoiler) after everything is finished in the end there is no 'word'. In fact the end is just nothing. No big revelation, no mystery solved just the revelation that all religions worship the same God. BLAH! If you read the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and liked it, don't read this book. You will be severly disappointed.

B002JODUI4|2.0|I went to go see moderat live in L.A. (a truley genius group of german artists on the Bpitch label)    And they were opening for Deadmau5 so i figured Deadmau5 must be good right? WRONG    It's the same old 4/4 house beat, predictable build ups, and really nothing new or exciting happening in the music.  Songs are repetitive and lame TBH, way overhyped and overrated, his main draw was his outfit (a mouse), a gimmick to hide the lack of substance in his music.    i agree with Deadmau5 saying he hates DJ's cause all they do is play other people's music, perhaps he could explain why a large part of one of his songs contained a daft punk song (harder better faster stronger, gimme a F%&@ing break kanye #2)    unoriginal, uninspired, and overhyped. This album would only be good on drugs as evident by the naive drugged out fans at his show.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and The Lost Symbol is a fantastic addition to the collection. Dan Brown sticks to the same writing style as his other books so if you were not a fan of any other than you will not be a fan of this one either. However if you do like his other books then you will certainly be pleased to read The Lost Symbol.     I love books that carry on with the same characters and build upon them, The Lost Symbol is no exception to this as Robert Langdon continues his journey in Washington, D.C. searching for the Freemasons. Fantastic book, one that I highly recommend.
B000003BEM|5.0|This album marked a return to The Rolling Stones R&B roots, after the (disappointing) psycedelic album [[ASIN:B00006AW2M Their Satanic Majesties Request]].  This is a classic album, from \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" to \\"Salt of the Earth\\".  It features my favorite Stones song, \\"Street Fighting Man\\", which was NOT a hit single, because it was banned by most radio stations.  Just buy it already!
0385504225|2.0|i dont want to give anything about the book away, but having read all of dan brown's books, I feel he sold this one short. 6 years of hype really built this book up and instantly sent it to the number 1 spot on the new york times. but once people read it, the masses of reviews reveal that brown did way too much to make the book a history lesson with long drawn out spans of nothingness. having taken place in the capital of the US i was looking forward to many locations throughout the city and an interesting conspiracy about the capitol, but instead found nothing of the sort. I found myself force through the last 40 pages to ultimately be let down. dan brown's first 4 books were really interesting, but this time i found myself getting bored with the same style, which lead to some very predictable portions. i really felt let down by the book and feel this will lead to a poor movie. angels and demons was such a fantastic book and this has gone in a completely different direction.

THE THOUGHTS PROCESS TO CREATE THIS ALBUM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IS PURE DARK BEAUTIFUL HIP HOP POETRY. THERES EXCELLENT GUEST VERSES FROM FELLOW CLANS MEN WHO BROUGHT THERE A* GAME TO THIS PROJECT. STANDOUT GUEST VERSES ON THIS RECORD ARE GHOSTFACE KILLAH ON 4TH CHAMBER. METHOD MAN ON SHADOWBOXIN' RAEKWON AND GHOSTFACE ON INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS. THE PRODUCTION FROM THE RZA AND BEATS ARE INCREDIBLE. YOU CAN PLAY THE WHOLE ALBUM WITHOUT SKIPPING 1 TRACK. PUT LIQUID SWORDS ON FOR ANYONE THAT HASN'T HEARD IT AND INSTANTLY BLOWS THEM AWAY.

B002FRNCG0|4.0|Paramore is one of freshest acts in power pop/punk music today. Thanks to a strong sophomore album and a lot of screen time in 'Twilight this loud quartet has pretty much let us know they exist.<br /><br />So now we have their 3rd installment. So far I see in the reviews here that you either love it or you hate it. I think the reason why people hate is because it is not like the previous record. Haley doesn't screech as much and the songs are not all loud and jumpy. . That is not always a bad thing when it comes to music. I have only listened to this album once and yes it is not as much fun as RIOT. However this band is definitely trying to do something new. I always say that a band gets a lot of favor in my eyes when they try new sounds and techniques. The songs on 'Brand New Eyes' are pretty diverse. You have some classic Paramore like in 'Ignorance' and something new like 'The Only Exception' Then, you have a few in-betweens like 'Turn It Off'. Paramore's sound has definitely matured you can hear it in the songs that don't sound like previous albums and that is a huge plus as well.<br /><br />There is a message that this guys are trying to send and that is they want to be around for a while I am sure if you think you can come up with at least 5 acts that are in their category that you probably haven't heard from in a while. I agree with the people that gave 'Brand New Eyes' a good review. I appreciate the changes and I welcome more from this band in the coming years. Just to put it out there I am glad that Haley didn't have to sing so loud through the whole cd if this album ended up being 'RIOT!'s' evil twin, she probably would have destroyed her vocal chords and that would prove no longevity for Paramore. I like them and I want them to stay a while.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Ok, so I just reviewed Three Days Grace's debut album yesterday, and I gave it a pretty good grade, despite the minor flaw I picked up on (the lack of a fresh feeling or originality).  `One X', Three Days Grace's sophomore album, doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but it perfects everything that they attempted on their debut, delivering an album that is nearly perfect.  I mean, while there is certainly things they could have done to elevate the material and add layers of newness to it, there is not a single track that `needs' anything else.<br /><br />It's kind of funny, because I was listening to this on iTunes the other day and looking at the grade that I gave each song, and this is the ONLY album I have that I gave 5 stars to every track.  The album is not the best I have, nor is it any where near my favorite; and there are plenty of other albums that have much, MUCH stronger material, but this is one of the only albums that is really blemish free; consistent and engaging from track to track.<br /><br />I can't complain about anything, nor would I wish a change on anything.<br /><br />So, how do you review an album without a single true `standout', beings that each and every track is pretty much as good as the one that came before and the one that comes after it?<br /><br />Those who enjoyed the aggressive nature of tracks like `I Hate Everything About You' and `Burn' will really sink their teeth into `Animal I Have Become' and the album opener `It's All Over', both of which are stunning examples of hard hitting riffs and catchy lyrics.  `Time of Dying' is another in this vein, aggressive yet there is an accessible quality that makes it easy to get into.<br /><br />You just want to chant these songs in your car at the top of your lungs.<br /><br />Radio friendly `Never Too Late' got a lot of play and became an instant fan favorite, and it's easy to understand why.  It's a powerful and touching track that makes good use of the bands ability to make the morose compelling.  If there is anything I could point out as a so-called flaw it would be that the band seems to have a one-track mind when it comes to subject matter (depression and suicide top the list), but thankfully they create a new feeling with each track, so it never really feels like rehashed territory, even though it is.<br /><br />`Riot' is probably my favorite song on the album; the chorus alone is like the catchiest thing I've ever heard (and the redundancy is NOT a deterrent as it was on their debut album).  `Pain' was one of the first tracks I `fell for', but incessant radio play kind of killed it a bit for me.  That said; it is still fantastic.<br /><br />A nice thing about this album is that Three Days Grace embrace a sense of melodic texture on their songs, giving us some mellow tracks much like `Wake Up' off their debut.  `Get Out Alive', `Over and Over' and `On My Own' are standouts in that regard.  `Get Out Alive' is beyond spectacular; one of my personal favorites.  There is a really nice commercial (I know that sounds bad, but I don't mean it that way) quality to tracks like `Let It Die' and `Gone Forever'.  They are very accessible songs, both of which are clear `singles' so it's odd to me that neither was ever selected; for I would have thought they would have been better received than `Animal I Have Become' (not that it was poorly received, but these songs just scream \\"PLAY ME ON THE RADIO\\").  `Gone Forever' has a tinge of Weezer here that I just eat up.  I've never been a huge fan of Weezer, but they remind me of them, in all the right areas.<br /><br />The title track, which closes out the album, is probably the weakest song here, which is a bit of a downer, beings that I really like it when a band or musical artists goes out with a bang, but the song is still very solid.<br /><br />So, like I said, not a sour note here; seriously.  If you liked their debut album then you will devour this one for it takes their potential and completelyruns with it, offering an album that is a perfected variation of their debut.  I only wish they hadn't squandered that potential with their third album (such a major disappointment), but I'll get into that on another review.ir debut.

1594488878|5.0|There is a pompous doof of a character in Juliet who writes an internet review so over-zealous in his praise that his readers react against his words and are predisposed to hate the work he is reviewing.  At the risk of life imitating art, I'd like to say that this is a very good book.  Hornby's genius lies in how seemingly accessible he is.  After reading this book, I would have felt perfectly welcome to knock on his door and walk on in for a visit.  If any of the cliches about British writers are true, this would be nuts, but Hornby makes it seem logical.    Rating a writer's books is fairly innocuous fun, though meaningless, but I'd have to say this is his best yet.
0385504225|1.0|I really enjoyed Dan Brown's first two \\"Da Vinci Code\\" books. They were well written, fun, exciting, can't put it down and have to stay up all night thrillers. I even enjoyed Mr. Brown's interesting view of Christianity and the Catholic church. The first two books those books were so well done that they motivated me to once again study the history, topics and people Mr. Brown presented. They were thought provoking and always good material as a conversation starter or debate topic. However, The Lost Symbol has nothing in common with the first two books. It is poorly written, the presentation of the Masons, Noetic science, Christianity and other topics are jumbled and disorganized. I'm not the most original thinker and even I figured out the plot twists and surprises long before they were presented.I could go on for several paragraphs and describe in detail what's wrong with The Lost Symbol but isn't worth the time of effort because it is just a terrible book.<br /><br />Save your money and go to Applebee's for their 2 for $20.00 deal. It's a better value and a whole lot more fun.
0307266303|5.0|Many consider me a bookworm and a film buff. That said I have never been compelled to write a review. Here goes my first one:    Take \\"The DaVinci code\\" (book) and Man Facing Southeast \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste\\" (IMHO a great but obscure Argentinian film from 1986), place them in a blender. What comes out is Born to Run.    What is almost scary is that the first two are works of fiction and Born to Run is a true account. Man Facing Southeast begins and ends with a riddle. A quest for the identity of its protagonist, a \\"Jesus\\" like character named Ramses who finds himself in a mental asylum.     A much more complex but also simpler riddle is masterfully dissected in the pages of this book. Completely unintentionally (I doubt Mr. McDougall has ever heard of Man facing southeast) it might even have the answer to Ramses identity. No, Ramses is not Caballo Blanco nor a human foot caged inside a shoe... But could Ramses be the human spirit refusing to be caged?     I think this book has the potential of changing lives. It is that good, highly recommended.
0307278255|4.0|Lahiri's prose is melodious and full. Her characters are gently coaxed into the light. She weaves a unique tapestry of interconnected stories and by the end, they all come together as one. Not everyone may be a fan but I would recommend this book to anyone. Her style is original.
0226264211|5.0|This book is not only a great economics book, but it is also a great book on law and government as well, because it discusses the unintended consequences of laws.    If you are torn between reading [[ASIN:0156334607 Free to Choose]] or Capitalism and Freedom, I strongly recommend the latter. Not only is this book shorter than Free to Choose, but Friedman does a better job of arguing his case in Capitalism and Freedom. Both Greg Mankiw and Larry Summers recommend Capitalism and Freedom as their top econ book. I do too.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show. I love the banter, I love the characters, and I even love the plots. This one is must-see TV for me, and I think I've already watched and re-watched the eps on DVR so often I can recite bits of dialogue from memory.    Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are fantastic together. Lots of chemistry between them. And I wish I had a daughter like Alexis. Susan Sullivan is always wonderful.    In addition, they get New York RIGHT. So few shows do, like CSI:NY having a cabbie offer a woman a cigarette when New Yorkers know that it's been illegal to smoke in a cab for at least twenty years. They even know what a rent-controlled apartment is!    I can't wait for the rest of the new season, and I hope they get the DVDs for next season out as quickly as they did these!
1401323820|4.0|Richard Castle is the international bestselling author of the successful Storm series, featuring his heroic, recurring character, Derek Storm.  After publishing 25 books, Castle decided he'd had enough of this character and in his last book, Storm Fall, Derek Storm met his precisely timed end.  But Castle is back with a new book, possibly a new series, and a new and beautiful detective by the name of Nikki Heat.    In Heat Wave we meet Nikki Heat for the first time as she deals with a case of a New York real estate tycoon who has committed suicide by plunging to his death from the balcony of his high-rise home.  Heat skillfully examines the crime scene and soon puts the facts together: the man was murdered.  And so begins this fast-paced thriller as Heat puts the details and facts together, bringing her closer to finding out the identity of the killer.  But there is someone chasing her, looking to \\"get rid of her\\" before she gets too close.  Heat finds herself unavoidably partnered with a successful magazine journalist looking to research NYPD's finest for an article.  While Heat finds Jameson Rook initially to be a waste of space, she finds herself attracted to him, and under all this pressure, Rook becomes a safe refuge in this \\"storm\\" of a case.     Castle does an impressive job of balancing the gritty, crime scene details; the crucial steps of a unsolved crime; along with some very human characters with some very human needs.  When Heat and Rook get together there is a tangible frisson that jus leaps of the page, making readers hot and heavy under the collar.  Castle has admitted to doing some of his own research through working with NYPD, but one can't help but wonder if Castle is getting up to anything like what Heat and Rook end up doing together.  One could blame it on the heat, but this reviewer thinks there's something deeper going on here.    [...]
B000F1IQNM|5.0|The kids love it, I love it, and the movie attempts to teach responsibility.  Also has a great ending (generally lacking from movies these days).  It's a great family movie.    The only con that I saw is that the nanny describes herself as a \\"government nanny\\" (referring to her employment agency).  This sounds too much like big government.  Very scary and just in time for Halloween.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Really faster than older HP12C model.   I don't like the new keys but all the other features are great.
0385504225|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed by this book. I read both books with the same main character (\\"DaVinci Code\\" and in my opinion the far better one, \\"Angels & Demons\\") and loved them, so I was expecting this one to follow in similar footsteps. Well, it started of good. The (almost) whole novel is fast-paced with each chapter ending with a cliffhanger that makes you want to read \\"just one more chapter\\". But somewhere 3/4 ways into it, it looses its steam. The last few chapters have a little too much of the \\"philosophical\\" stuff, and although there is a major surprise revelation, it still wasn't enough to fall back into it. At least for me... in the end it was just an OK read.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I have to imagine that it is difficult for any band (or musician) to go for years without recording an album and then finally go back into the studio--never mind dealing with the death of a key band member in the interim.  The danger is that the band will take every melody, chorus, guitar riff, etc. accumulated over those years and just dump it into the new album, resulting in unfocused noise (see G 'n R's \\"Chinese Democracy\\" [I really wanted to enjoy that album, but it was not to be]).    Although the new AiC album lacks that classic single (e.g., Man in the Box or Rooster), it is a solid album that is well-crafted and focused.  If anything, it almost borderlines on being overproduced because it feels too clean or slick in spots (for lack of better description).  There was something raw and rough about some of the previous AiC albums that made them appealing, and that's missing on this album.    But given the time that has passed since AiC's last album and the expectations layered onto this new one, I found it to be a solid effort with some memorable songs.    I recently caught AiC live, and they played A Looking in View and Acid Bubble during their set.  I wish that they had played Check My Brain, Your Decision and Take Her Out as well.  The fact that I find myself wanting them to play more of their new music speaks volumes.    It wouldn't be right to write a review and ignore the obvious--the fact that Layne wasn't on this album.  You can't replace his voice or his words, but I'll give DuVall credit.  He meshes well with the band and is deferential to Layne while adding his own spirit to the music.  Some may criticize the band for moving ahead with someone other than Layne, but I, for one, am grateful that I still get to hear the band play the songs that we love live in concert and that the band continues to make music.
0321344758|4.0|This book is a very useful introductory text on usability. On scanning (no pun intended - the author has a chapter on how web users scan) the book I discovered it has valuable insight into almost all day to day issues we have designing sites which work. It helps you with a reality check on your site. You may not find solutions to your usability problems, but what you will find are suggestions and approaches to find a solution which works. The language and flow are really simple and that's what I liked most of this book.
B001AQO41E|3.0|1. I love this film, and this review is not a review of the film.    Okay...that out of the way.  The extra features are horrible.  No commentary?  No behind-the-scenes?  The only extras are a couple documentaries about real life ghost hunting, which in my book equates to nothing.    However, the remastering is decent enough to warrant rebuying on blu-ray if you're a big fan of the film.
B000PBLFFS|5.0|A scientist finds a way to enhance the brain to make an animal brilliant.  First, the operation was performed on a mouse named Algernon.  Experiments proved that it was indeed a success.  Then they found a retarded, human subject named Charlie, who happened to work in a bakery.  At his job, his peers tend to tease him, always setting him up to be the butt end of a joke. While the operation was indeed a success, we see the human developing into a person and finally a man, who happens to fall in love with the psychologist who studies him.  One of the first signs of his development is how he finds a way to reverse one of the tricks his bakery friends play on him.  After the psychologist assigns a little exercise for him, he has a very clever exercise for her, which stumps her.  He intrigues her as she watches him mentally grow.<br /><br />Once he becomes brilliant, the young and beautiful psychologist cannot help herself and returns the love.  After he far exceeds her intellectual prowess, she becomes afraid for him, fearing that something might go wrong.<br /><br />One day the little mouse named Algernon that he always carries with him dies, leaving him devastated.  At first, he panics, scared that he will revert back to his retarded state.  After a while, he realizes that only his brilliance could figure out a way to reverse the inevitable.  Soon, he imagines, he will revert to his former state and lose the love of his life.  A great book to read on a rainy day.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is a great mic for its price, I was searching a lot for a lapel or lavalier mic for my camcorder but or it was out of my budget or it wasn't good enough. I had even bought a radio shack mic  that I did not like at all. When I finally found this one I got amazed for the good sound it capture.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|As an average movie viewer (and not a professional critic) I loved this animated movie. Excellent story line and a very touching movie. Characters are well presented and the animal-human connection is so well presented it is believable. It's probably the best PIXAR movie I have seen so far, save the Incredibles. Loved it and can't wait to own this dvd. Highly recommended 5/5.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I originally heard this band on Letterman and I found myself humming the song home for the next week. Eventually I knew I realized I would just have to purchase it. Needless to say, I've not been disappointed. Home has a Johnny Cash/June Carter feel with the enthusiasm of Rockabilly-meets-Phish. It's just plain fun! The rest of the album is kind of all over the board, but in general very enjoyable.
B000BB1MIC|4.0|I have all the seasons preceding this, and while Rory and Lorelei have changed a lot, they still have the fast talking, coffee crazed humor that's so appealing. It's gotten more dramatic and a little darker, but that's expected because Rory isn't 16 anymore, she's a sophmore in college now, and that makes things a little crazy.
0316017922|3.0|Gladwell's latest edition continues with his unique and compelling thought process applied to success.  He asserts that many more factors than IQ and one lucky break gets one to the top.  Early in the book he examines hockey players from the earliest of ages and makes a well documented and surprising argument.  His illumination of how a number of very successful people got to the top is unexpected and believable.  There are a couple of things later in the book that seem much less convincing for instance, he contends that peasant life in France was leisurely through the winter.  Maybe for some, but it needs more substantive proof.  The ethnic argument for Korean plane crashes is horribly fascinating and too easily dismissed in our PC world.  Also the language argument for why some cultures are so prone to math success has been argued for years and is well laid out here.  He also brings up a really interesting idea of generational behavior and goes no where with it.  Again, if you enjoy reading Gladwell, this book brings up some great ideas, but also left me dangling and questioning along the way.
B000001GAM|5.0|This is one version of Bruckner's ninth that really deserves classic status; it is a powerful account (using the Novak edition), with many thrilling passages and wonderfully shaped climaxes (especially powerful brass playing), deeply committed - some have claimed that the approach is a little too committed and affectionate and that the attempt to make every small figure sound profound results in a somewhat too undiscriminating and cloying result, but I seriously wonder if they can be hearing the same performance I do; to my ears Giulini's control of the argument is nothing short of marvelous, and the way he realizes the visionary qualities of the music and drives it unerringly towards the conclusion always with the sense of magnitude is impressive beyond words.     It's a long-breathed reading, seven minutes longer than the classic Karajan account, but with a sense of grandeur never challenged on disc, I think. Both the first movement and the Adagio sounds grander and more powerful than ever - Giulini takes care over every climax and how their comings are heralded minutes before, and the fiery undercurrents are as strong as or stronger than in any other performance I've heard. The scherzo is dynamic and almost driven, with some marvelous playing from the orchestra - and of course the whole work benefits of Vienna Philharmony orchestra on top form with radiant strings, pungent woodwinds and, in particular, warm brass playing underpinning what is, without a trace of doubt, a truly magnificent performance. Sound quality is ambient and warm, but clear. To conclude, while I don't want to recommend that anyone part with the Karajan version, this one is, indeed, something of must for any fan of the composer; urgently recommended.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|Why is this pabulum constantly on regular rock stations? The singer's overearnest bubblegum yodeling bring to mind more than anything a lively game of soggy biscuit. His masturbatory stylings over a bed of rehashed bruce springsteen cliches is so incredibly annoying! AHHH make him stop!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I love this CD.  Whitney sounds great and is finally singing songs that have a positive meaning.  I love every song on this CD.  My favorite is I Got You. GO WHITNEY GO.  God Bless!
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I became a fan of Paramore when one day I heard Misery Business on the radio and decided to figure out who these people were. I bought both of there CDs and fell in love. All We Know Is Falling was good but to me Riot was definitely their best work and still is. I'd say Riot is my favorite ablum of all time, I like everything about every song on that CD. I gave this new CD a 4 star rating because I love Paramore to death and couldnt see giving them anything less, not that the album should get anything less but I do feel a little disappoined by this album. I've listened to it about 4 or 5 times so far and alot of the songs just seem a little slapped together and a little similar in sound where as Riot, the music and singing just seemed right together and just seemed to flow and make sense. Each song was unique. Im not so good as describing this but I'm trying here. I do like the CD but... it's just not Riot! I hope it grows on me the more I listen. And I do know that Paramore said the CD was going to be different and they are maturing but I wish it had more of the Riot sound. Still I will remain a fan forever.    So I've had the CD since it was released and sure enough it has grown on me. Think I was a little scared off by the new sound and was hoping for something else and didnt want to like it. The more I listen to it the more I see that it is Paramore. I do love most of this CD, very catch and is still the Paramore we all know and love, though I do stand by my first statement in saying, good but not their best. Careful is a great song as is Playing God and Looking Up. Saw Paramore last night front row and they did alot of these new songs and I must say, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! They are ever improving in all aspects.
B0026ZNL80|5.0|If you've heard these guys before and liked them then you will love this. They keep improving. Their best effort to date. Still have that unique sound that's all their own only better. The mix and engineering on this is their best so far. Musically it seems to be a bit more structured, mature and tight. Tough to nail down any genera to put this into, but if you like good kick butt in your face rock and roll with a progressive influence...go for it. Great album.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|When my video came I was anxious to listen to it, but to my surprise it skipped so badly that I returned it to you and as yet haven't received another copy. I can't rate this as it was so bad I wasn't able to enjoy it. Please send me another that is undamaged so that I may enjoy watching it. Thank you<br /><br />I am sure that you won't be printing this review.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|We all know about the \\"Follow That Dream\\" RCA subsidiary, where a comprehensive picture of a recording session or soundtrack, etc., is painted with master strokes.<br />Here is Elvis' studio comeback album from 1969. The last comeback album was \\"Elvis Is Back\\", nine years back. Both albums are masterpieces; both could have sold even more. Who knows why?<br />Although there are classics throughout his career, and yes, in that \\"lean period\\" as well, these cuts must have meant alot more than \\"get me back on the charts\\".<br />His singing on every single song is astonishing. He suddenly jumps to falsetto on \\"Any Day Now\\", and his final \\"don't fly away!\\" is enough to bring a hardened criminal to confess to all his crimes.<br />The mono mixes are sure to bring out that nostalgic feeling - that feeling, at the time, that I think I'll put away that Paradise, Hawaiian Style album for a while. (\\"Sand Castles\\" was beautiful, though).<br />So here's another five big ones: It's gotta be *5* if I could get through \\"Hey Jude\\". (Sorry, fellow fans).
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|Mmm. The anger is back. This is the key attribute of the music that drove the masses worldwide to The Prodigy a decade ago. It was angry. Steaming. Explosive. Even the track names sparked controversy. With really only \\"Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned\\" to gap the time since the rage nirvana that was \\"Fat of the Land\\", there were justifiable worries about the direction of something new. Fans will be pleased to know that, instead of another questionable attempt to reinvent themselves, The Prodigy have walked back a few steps and decided to charge forward from there.    Anger. It really is all about anger. A lot of the old appeal was listening to the music and feeling that it was a bunch of guys who wanted to scream at the universe. In 2003 it's almost at though they got together and thought \\"let's just record a bunch of stuff that's been our minds and sounds cool\\" and triggered an identity crisis by accident. Not this time. There is so much anger in this album, it tugs at your very soul-- see 'Omen' and 'Run With the Wolves' in particular. Now older and more matured, the group has surrendered the need to have a shock factor in their music and have gone ahead to work on the finer details of the art instead.    Not every track is 100% pure rage coming out of your speakers, but you don't get any real chances to relax. It's The Prodigy as they originally intended you to enjoy them. This is a lovely message of \\"thanks for waiting and putting up with us\\", though they certainly don't need to make any kind of apology. The music speaks for itself. It's not a revolutionary release like what we saw in 1997, but the vibe and background feeling are here again.
1594481717|3.0|I haven't read the entire book yet, but so far, the author seems intent on convincing everyone that he is a right brain thinker by forcing analogies and focusing more on creative fluff than actual content. The first 20 pages people should have learned in a basic psychology class, or even high school physiology. I'm hoping the content sections are better.
B0026OE2NY|1.0|Understand first that I am a liberal, a passionate environmentalist and someone who spends enormous time working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable living. So, I should love this film, right?    Sorry, but this is the kind of pretentious enviro \\"art\\" that gives the movement a bad name. True, some of the photography is stunning, but the painfully minimalist narration and moaning \\"native\\" music (reminds me of the theme from \\"Battlestar Galactica\\") are like a bad political commercial: all emotion, no facts.    Actually there are a few facts offered, but as others have pointed out, many of those are flat-out wrong.  (Last time I looked, our species had been on the planet for around a million years, the first cities were created around 7,000 years ago and the Grand Canyon was in Arizona.)    I know a lot of Greens who get off on guilt, and they'll probably enjoy this immensely, but it certainly won't educate anyone, change any minds or do anything else to help save the planet.
B000HA4WTI|4.0|Moves at a good pace. Too slow in some spots. Cars are stars...drivers in 2nd place. My personal fav = Brian Tee. He makes the that metal machine look almost as good as him! He's the reason I invested my $$ in this DVD!!!
0385504225|2.0|I have read all 5 of Dan Brown's novels.  Here's how I would rank them:    #1 Da Vinci Code (great)  #2 Digital Fortress (good)  #3 Angels & Demons (average)  #4 Lost Symbol (poor)  #5 Deception Point (terrible)    My biggest problem with The Lost Symbol is that I completely guessed the anticlimatic ending a quarter of the way into the book.  The plot also requires supposedly intelligent characters to be unbelievably trusting and careless.    There are a few interesting historical facts introduced throughout the book but certainly nothing close to those in Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons.
159562015X|5.0|This book is well-written. The test opened my eyes to the potential I had as my current job did not align with my strengths. I am now moving to a new job within the company where I will be able to utilize my strengths more. This book makes a good gift. I am thinking of getting one for my brother.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The Fog of War is a obligatory documentary. Enlights what happens behind the scenes, well made. I strongly recommend.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Smalliville Season 8 has come and gone--and is back on DVD / Blu-ray.  Season 8 is more hit than miss.  I enjoyed episodes building on the Clark/Lois relationship, especially a \\"throw-away\\" episode called \\"Committed,\\" in which the development of the relationship is revealed through lie-detector-prompted electrocution.  The episodes featuring the development of Davis/Doomsday were interesting.  Unfortunately, the development was cut short, and there was really no day-of-doom that came to fruition, or even really threatened Smallville & Metropolis.  The hits for Season 8, however, were the actual character development of Davis, Clark, and Lois.  Davis/Doomsday especially is a well-acted and interesting character.  (Sidenote: my kids LOVE seeing their Sith-turned-Jedi actor as Davis/Doomsday.  See the video game \\"Star Wars: Force Unleashed,\\" which has a better plot line than ANY of the new Star Wars episodes, 1-3.)    Now the misses.  There are some AWFUL ideas that actually made it to the small screen, including Lana returning for several painfully bad episodes, especially one entitled \\"Power,\\" in which Lana becomes a Krypton-powered Super Girl.  Really, this is horrible.  I was *happy* to see her leave the show for good.  Good riddance. My wife thinks the show has already \\"jumped the shark\\" and this episode seemed to confirm her conclusion, however I hold out hope for a nice finale in Season 9.    It is interesting to watch Clark become the Red-Blue Blur, but there really needs to be quicker advancement to Superman, as hopefully Season 9 will do.  I am being generous by giving this 4 stars.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I was introduced to Ms Rae's music by the movie \\"Venus\\".  I thought my daughter would like it and bought it for her.  Unfortunately, my daughter already had this CD.  Or maybe fortunately, because I'm getting to like it myself.  She has an interesting voice and the arrangements are likewise interesting.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The American version of this controller is horrible, buy the Japanese controller and you will see that its made with completely different material that is much more stable and stronger, anyone who has both, can open them up and see the difference, i bought one of these and it didn't last more than one month, while my other Japanese joystick is still working for more than one year
0385504225|5.0|I must admit that I can't understand all the negative reviews of this book.  In holding with Angels and Demons and the Davinci Code, this is another vintage Langdon mystery brought to us by Dan Brown.      Nobody quite melds such different themes into a book like Brown does; ancient mysticism, religion, masonic secrets and science.  They were hallmarks of the first two Robert Landgon adventures and they're in the Lost Symbol in spades.    Langdon is summoned to Washington DC to give a last minute lecture for a friend of his, Peter Solomon, head of the Smithsonian Institute and 33rd degree Mason.  What Robert discovers when he arrived at the lecture however is something he couldn't have thought of in his wildest imagination.  He finds his long time friend Peter waiting for him, but only PART of him.  Peter's severed hand along with a cryptic message left by a madman, Peter's captor.    What transpires after that and along the course of the book is true Dan Brown.  Riddles wrapped in mysteries, arcane rituals, ancient symbols, all leading on a hunt to find Peter's abductor by the end of the night and unravel the mysteries of the lost symbol.    Brown didn't let me down with this one.  While I thought Angels and Demons was the better of the two, both that and DaVinci code set a benchmark for this type of mystery.  A tough act to follow indeed.  But I think Brown's third offering in the series is totally worthy of being held in the same regard as the preview two Robert Langdon books.  In addition, the Lost Symbol (as well as the previous two) make the reader reconsider what's dogma in regards to religion and science.  They make you reconsider paradigms that you've grown up with and have accepted for, quite likely, your whole life.  That's the reaction I have to his books in any event.    I devoured this book in short order because the subject matter was VERY interesting, as are the characters, and I just find Dan Brown has a great writing style.  Very fluid and always engaging.    Loved it!
0385504225|3.0|Unlike the last few novels, Brown depicts his organization of interest in a wise victim rather than evil incarnate, which is a nice change. It's also nice to read a novel he has based in the US. But while this book is readable, it was still predictable and not up to the level that some of his other writing are.  I would consider this a good way to bide your time between Da Vinci Code and whatever he does next.  It's not hard to put down, but not hard to pick up either.
1584282584|5.0|This is a brilliant book that concentrates on techniques for non-studio flash photography. Neil van Niekerk has been imparting his very considerable professional photographic knowledge on his website for some years now and this book both explains and expands the practical approach to flash photography that he is such a master. Thoroughly recommended, and would consider it essential reading if you have a serious interest in the subject.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|everything is really cool, songs, interviews, everything!!  its a complete DVD with amazing songs, lights and solos!!  buy it!! its INCREDIBLE!!
B002Q63JEU|5.0|There are few albums that i actually think are worth buying. This is definantly one of them. I Accept that the change is good! Especially that last track. If you dont like the album i would try giving it another listen. The change grows on you, and after that its hard to get it off haha. $4.00 is a steal. Paramore has matured as much musically as they have personally after years of hard work and long tours. Much love Paramore, your friend Oakley.
B001AQR39O|3.0|The series showcases a bunch of self-centered degenerates who never seem to take responsibilty for their actions - which, of course, explains how our current affirmative action president was elected. The various characters depict coke fiends, borderline pediofiles and a man who takes zero responsibilty for his unborn child while engaging in drunk driving and doing drugs all while being a glib imbecile. In short it shows what's wrong with the country in general and Southern California in particular. It does have some funny moments.
0962477060|2.0|This book does describe the logical patterns of the C-A-G-E-D sequence.  Seeing how these patterns interconnect may be enlightening, but, it's not the revolutionary way of thinking the author would lead you to believe.  One dissapointing thing is that the pentatonic scale is the basis for this book and when you try to adapt it to other scale forms it becomes less apparent and falls apart completely with some scale shapes.  When the book eventually begins to discuss modes (which it tries hard to avoid in the first two sections) it glazes over them and doesn't convey any real information.  It focuses on scale forms yet the actual underlying scale goes by a different name - confusing.  You may find this book enlightening to a degree, but it won't revolutionize your playing or the way you look at the guitar.  If you're looking for a good fretboard / music theory book for the guitar, this book will only get you so far.

1595141715|5.0|This book teaches people not to joke around too much, and to take life more serious. I'm not saying joking around is bad but there is a limit to it, and also to never go to far with it. Like Alex in the book did, and made a list called \\"Hot , whos Not\\" that really hurt Hannah's Feelings and led her to her death.
0061766089|2.0|Let me start by saying that overall, I did not enjoy or benefit from reading \\"Change By Design\\" by Tim Brown.<br /><br />The book is organized into ten chapters.  It starts with an introduction to design thinking, which attempts to explain the concept, and provides some background information on Brown.  In the introduction, Brown warns that he will be using examples from his own design firm, IDEO.  This sets the stage for the rest of the book, which is a thinly veiled account of \\"What would IDEO do?\\"  But in a nutshell, Chapter one is really an exploration of three overlapping design paradigms: inspiration, ideation and implementation...with an ethnographic spin.<br /><br />As the reader progresses into chapter one, Brown admits \\"Although I would love to provide a simple, easy to follow recipe that would ensure that every project ends successfully...the nature of design thinking makes that impossible.\\"  This admission alone should warn you that the book is more about pearls of wisdom that Brown has picked up through his experiences than about a unified methodology or best practice that can lead to success.  The remainder of chapter one pretty much states the obvious - you need a sufficient quantity of \\"A\\" players on your team to have a winning team, and you benefit from golden-tongued orators who happen to be visionary pitch salesmen.<br /><br />Chapter two gets into jibber-jabber about being a people-person, or being compassionate, empathetic and achieving other states of manipulative emotion.  In a nutshell, learn to rely on what I call \\"pre-aligned chance\\" and become one with your target, err I mean customer.<br /><br />Chapter three introduces process and thinking, and expands on the Chapter one concept.  The most useful things in this chapter (in this book?) are the rules of innovation.  In fact, if you don't read any more than these rules, you will walk away from this book with increased insight.<br /><br />Moving on to chapter four, it is a rather dull discussion on prototyping.  Nothing Earth-shattering here.  Chapter five delves into innovation and the trends of experience.  And more WWID (What would IDEO Do).  Chapter six calls itself a chapter on storytelling.  There is some banter about the \\"Cool Biz\\" program, spearheaded by proper storytelling.  (Wow, I'm glad my office doesn't keep the thermostat at 82.)  After some other case studies, we again get back to Brown's premise...Design Thinking can solve any issue or dilemma (and I say that sarcastically).<br /><br />If you make it to Chapter 7, you have also made it to Part II, and I salute you for being a patient person.  Here, the book talks a lot about corporate innovation strategies.  I don't remember much about chapter 8.  Chapter 9 starts talking about the wonders of global design thinking.  Overall, Part II is even more dry that part I, and I had a real hard time reading past Chapter 7.<br /><br />The final chapter starts off warning the reader about how design thinking required overcoming the  \\"knowing-doing gap.\\"  Next, we finally have a succinct, step by step methodology for employing design thinking.<br /><br />Overall, if you read Chapters 3 and 10, you will know just as much as you would if you read the whole book.  On a more fundamental level, I question whether there is any value in reading the book at all.  I guess some might gain a better understanding of what the author calls \\"Design Thinking,\\" but most readers are probably already either knowingly or unknowingly implementing design type thinking in their organizations.th-shattering here.

0439023483|5.0|If you like graphic books..meaning that you like gory books you will absolutely love the hunger games. Its written completely from the main characters point of view and doesn't trail off into other sub-plots. very good read I read it in 3 days and it usually takes me 3 weeks to finish it definitely like this book!!!!
1604596163|2.0|I picked this book up in honor of banned book week.  It seems to me that this book gained more notoriety off the fact that it was banned than because it was a great piece of literature.  I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1920s, as the writing style was more reminiscent of a Victorian era novel.  Furthermore, Lawrence portrayed his characters as if they were in the Victorian era.  The characters were not well developed, thus making it hard to have sympathy for anyone in the story.  The end was disappointing as it simply fizzled away.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Having read all 4 of Dan Brown's previous novels, let me first say that the cadence of this book is classic Dan Brown. There are multiple threads progressing in parallel.  Just as a thread reaches fever pitch, the chapter ends and you are back to continue a different thread.  You are always hanging, awaiting resolution.  Brown keeps you reading.  He keeps you curious and not only about what will happen next but with questions like...Does such a site actually exist in DC? Does such a painting actually include these details?  As usual, Brown researches and then weaves in to the plot fascinating information on topics that were, to this point, a mystery to most readers. In this book, Brown provides a lot of information regarding the Masons and Noetic Science, but ,  at least in my case,  still left me hungry to learn more, similar to the amount of added interest that Brown evoked with his past novels regarding the Illuminati or the Knights Templar.  While, as usual, the novel includes unexpected twists, what I found most surprising and refreshing in this Brown work was that, this time, his focus was not just on developing an intriguing story but in actually advocating a belief---in this case providing context, scientific  and historical foundations to the concept that  \\"...ye are all Gods\\" and that we are Creators through our thoughts. Fans of writers such as Eckhart Tolle and Neale Donald Walsch will find kindred spirits in Brown's characters Peter and Catherine Solomon.  Perhaps novels such as this can go as far to promote the evolution of consciousness as non-fiction works on the subject. Thank you, Dan Brown for using your talent, research and popularity to lend legitimacy to this message.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|Talk about a colossal letdown!!  When I slipped disc one into my Blu-Ray player, with the upscaling I was expecting near pristine picture quality due to the fact that this collection was advertised as \\"remastered\\". That was a big fat lie!! Most of the videos looked OK-ish, not great, on disc one. The quality seemed to equal that of her previous video collections if not a tad worse. Disc two? Complete and total crapola!  I Want You looked as if someone taped it from TV. Blurry, grainy, AWFUL! I was also shocked that Human Nature and most of the others looked worse than on previous collections. Material Girl even popped and skipped in two places. I played it back twice to make sure I wasn't crazy. As mentioned countless times before, JML is freakin censored. I also believe Erotica is as well. Can't be sure since I have nothing to compare it to from a previous collection. Warner Bros should hang their heads shame for releasing such a piss poor product. I'm sure they don't give a rat's ass.    All that said however, let me touch on a few positive things about the collection.    1. Express Yourself comes in it's full form with the full 5 minute Shep Pettibone remix.  2. We get Who's That Girl, Into The Groove, True Blue and Live To Tell among others.    I just can't believe that after all this time Warner Bros would do this to Madonna fans. All the great years she's had with them and they release this? Shame shame shame!! I want my money back!!
0143038419|1.0|I decided to give this book a try after receiving it as a gift from a relative, and hearing others rave about it. The only thing I feel I gained from it is a sorry insight into what people enjoy reading. WHY!? I found Liz self-obsessed, shallow, and writing just to \\"hear\\" herself write. I respect that she went on a journey to find more meaning in life and get over her divorce. And, putting aside the fact that most people can never afford to go on this type of a journey, she chose some interesting ways to do it. But I wonder if she really ever gained anything from it?      I always try to finish books I start to do them justice, but this one has been downright painful. Italy was OK, and Richard from Texas in India was at least somewhat interesting, but the majority of it reads like a cross between a self-help book, a vapid memoir, and a religious brochure one would hand to you on a city street. When I switched to the audiobook to listen to during my commute, it was even more terrible as you can almost hear the author smile at just how pleasantly witty she is!  Super annoying.      Skip this book!

B0000TB014|5.0|I love this DVD. I had a Thriller Party on what would have been Michael's 51st birthday, and everyone loved it. It was very appropriate for the occasion, celebrating his life, not his death. On the other hand, we were disappointed with \\"Smooth Criminal\\" - the version on the video was fast framed, and with the speed of it you could not fully enjoy certain dance sequences, especially the \\"leaning over\\" part. All in all, the video is still worth investing in.

0439023491|4.0|This book keeps the thrill of The Hunger Games going and leaves you desperately wanting more!  Katniss is as witty and clever as she proved herself in the first book, and her dilemma over the man she should love manages to stay interesting to the reader--up until the last page!  I can't wait for the third book in this series.  The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are spreading all over my 8th grade hallway--with students AND teachers!
B002BSHWUU|1.0|Is what you need if you buy this!!<br /><br />It's re-packaged, re-hashed, re-engineered rubbish. It's just another excuse for Thumbs McFartney to bleed you all dry again and to line his pockets in an attempt to recover the cost of his divorce to the lovely Heather Mills.<br /><br />Yes they may have improved the sound quality (to the trained ear), but all you have here is just ANOTHER release to get you to part with your hard earned cash. This is WAY too expensive for what it is and to be honest is nothing more than a blatant rip-off.<br /><br />You have been warned!
0385504225|2.0|I'm a fan of the author and looked forward to the long awaited release of his latest work.  What a disappointment. Mr. Brown abandoned the reader in favor of Hollywood with this one.  I felt like the book was written in collaboration with  the film producers, not an editor.  Characters even seemed to be written with specific actors in mind. It was a long, drawn out read that can be condensed smoothly into under 2 hours. The good news is that it should translate to the screen better than the last two.
0061122416|4.0|In my search for the universal truth of the universe an my own believes, i bumped in to The Alchemist. I was inspired, thrilled, and most of all it was a great \\"eye opener\\" for me, as the story, which was brilliant written, tuched som subjects of nature that spoke to me.  I can highly recommend reading this book, and use it as a step on the ladder to Alchemy :-)
B002DKF47O|5.0|What can I say that has not been stated in previous reviews, Every album gets better and better, and that is saying a lot for a band who have a near perfect track record for releases.
0385504225|1.0|There's a week of my life I can't get back. The Lost Symbol was the most boring and repetitious book I have ever read; aside from Digital Fortress and Deception Pointe. He fills too many pages with the same unrealistic garble over and over. Without spoiling it for others; the motive was so unlikely and unintelligent, extremely disappointing; that I personally could not believe a writer of that magnitude has such little imagination. Sorry Dan, but the shoes of DaVinci Code are too big to fill. I'll pass on the movie; and do laundry instead.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Not really sure why everyone is bitching about this album so much. Vedder's voice is incredible on this album. You can't expect every album to be 7-minute long prog rock tracks. This album is incredibly mixed and is a step in a new direction for the band. The fact that it is roughly 35 minutes long is even better. No overlong \\"experiemental\\" crap that has bogged down many of the last albums, especially Riot Act and Binaural. The self-titled album was pretty good, but this one is one of the more impressive albums from one of the best bands of all-time.
B00005UW2B|4.0|Much has been said about Rudolf Barshai's close association with Shostakovich.  Barshai is considered an authority on Shostakovich, has arranged Shostakovich's string quartets into symphonies for small orchestra, has recorded much of Shostakovich's works, and yet hasn't left much of a stamp on Shostakovich's legacy via recordings.  This 11-CD set of the complete Shostakovich symphonies with the WDR Symphony Orchestra is consistently good, but definitely not in the realm of \\"definitive.\\"  There is none of the gravitas and electricity of Bernstein's or Solti's interpretations, none of the edgy realism from the leading Russian recordings, and none of the polish of newer sets by Jansons, Jarvi and others.  It's almost as though these performances are virtually stripped of interpretation--nothing but the notes, yet played well.  Nonetheless, it was interesting to hear these works from that perspective; it forced me to focus on Shostakovich's writing instead of the orchestra or conductor.  While this is certainly not the best complete set, and by far the best of the best can only be obtained by buying individual recordings of the best performances, at Brilliant Classics' bargain price this was worthwhile.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|We've all waited so long for something close to the greatness that was 90s rock. And now its finally here. You can't replace Layne Staley, obviously, but DuVall is pretty solid. His voice fits in well with Alice's signature sound. Many good tracks on this album, especially Last of My Kind and Lesson Learned. Any Alice fan should have this album.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown begins his novels with a prescribed fact sheet and rides his agenda through deception and distortions in a simplistic, predictable manner. 1/3 of the way through the novel, the reader is led to believe Peter's son begins his rejection/abandonment metamorphasis from a physical prison to one that engulfs him physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, cognitively and relationally. How trite to have evil die from glass shards falling from heaven while claiming world religions share one truth.
B002POMLHY|4.0|I've read some of the poor reviews to this and I think it really comes down to this... what are you looking for in this Breaking Benjamin record?    If you're looking for a very slightly toned down, yet still powerfull sound with a lot of maturity in lyrics and melodies... look no further; you've found it in \\"Dear Agony\\"    It's not flawless. It's not as \\"hard\\" as other records they've put out. It has a certain theme that all of the melodies in the songs seem to follow, but to be honest that theme has been one that has been with Breaking Benjamin since the beginning... and is the very reason I think they have so many fans. So to those who say the songs are too much alike... I think you're keying in too much on that theme; because they're are definitely differences in the songs both lyrically and musically. Maybe you have to listen closer or a few more times to appreciate it fully.    Overall, track-by-track, it's solid. I'm really impressed with what others and myself seem to be calling the \\"maturity\\" of the record. The melodies take you up and down and everywhere in between while triggering real emotion in every listener. Yet... you can still rock to this record... I think there are quite a few parts in different songs where Ben sounds angrier than I've heard him before. There also seems to be more growls than I've heard on any othe record, so it brings the \\"heavy\\"... just maybe not as much as you're used to hearing from BB.    Least favorite track - #1 - Fade Away. It sounds weird to me... I'm not sure, but I just don't like that track. The vocals seem over-synthesized.    Most Favorite Track - #9 - Title Track - Dear Agony. The melody is top-notch. Vocals are great. Mood is solemn and somber... yet somehow strangely uplifting. EXCELLENT job on this song. It's not heavy, and yes, it's slower... but it's great music.
B000002U82|5.0|This is an amazingly solid album--start to finish.  Most albums, even by great artists, have one or two great songs--three at the most.  This one breaks the mold in that each track is phenomenal and each very unique in its own respect.  Quite simply, it is one of the greatest albums of all time.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Is it me or is the sound quality of Porcupine tree's latest offering not on par with their last album. I am not going to comment on the music apart from saying that it is a fine addition to their line of work. I like nearly everything they have produced and was always impressed with the sound quality but The Incident seems to be very grainy and rough compared with FOABP. I was looking forward to the album as much for the recording quality as for the music. Maybe the vinyl is better, or am I mistaken. I use a relatively good HiFi system. Would like to hear other opinions on this
0452287588|5.0|Just read the book.  It will either make sense and be a life changing event, or it won't.  In fact if you go into it without any expectations, it will be all the better.  If you still aren't sure you want to spend any money on it, just go to Oprah's website and download the free podcasts from her book club section.  The talks between her and Tolle may be what get you interested and wanting to learn more.  That is how I found the book.

B0029LHW4U|4.0|Since the last full disc AIC put out, we've had to put up with the derivative knockoffs like the good (Fuel), the bad (Staind) and the ugly (Godsmack).  Sometimes it's hard to remember how good they really are because of their influence on subpar modern rock acts.  But this album is the real deal.  Thankfully, Cantrell leads on most of the songs, while Duvall complements him nicely on backup.  Some songs are flawed, like the first single \\"A Looking in View\\", as well as \\"Last of my kind\\".  But they can be overlooked thanks to killer tracks like Check my Brain, Your Decision, and the title cut.  I'd waited over a decade for this, and it was worth it.

B00000JMQD|5.0|An instant classic! Released the year I was born (1985) and remaining STILL one of my favorite films of all time, I was born to collect Oz memorabilia. I feel that this was a film that people really threw to the side and dis honed it. It never really got it's full true debut-which makes me sad. People seem to compare this, just cause it was a sequel, to the 1939 classic. It has NOTHING to do with is at all-it's a film that stands on it's own two feet. Created and written to follow the true spirit and imagination of L. Frank Baum's Oz books, it truly did just that. This is a cult classic and will remain that forever! I am a HUGE Oz fan and \\"Return\\" has the key to my heart and everything I have loved, read, and dreamed about Oz! Sure,  it's a little too dark and sometimes a little scary, but I think it was made to be just that. A darker side of Oz. What really surprises me is that it was made from Walt Disney. I know that Disney has always been interested in making an Oz film, but I just wish that they would have made so much more of an effort to support it. Sometimes when I mention to people about \\"Return\\" they don't know it even exists. I'm like \\"WHAT!\\" How could they have never seen this film. Such a shame to have missed out on this childhood film. Everything about this is magical-the characters, actors, costumes, and story! Magic! Find a copy of this (sometimes really hard to find)Buy it, and sit back for a different path down the yellow brick road! Make a trip to \\"Return To Oz!\\"
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Wow.  That's all I can really say...wow.  This album was so NOT what I was expecting, and yet SO what I needed to hear from my favorite band Muse.  I absolutely loved their last album Black Holes & Rev, but if you are expecting the same kind of music, you won't find much of it in this new album.  But don't misunderstand me.  It's still Muse, with each track as different and unique from the last.  \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" left me thinking, \\"I'm so glad I bought this album.  I love this song.\\"  And then \\"Guiding Light\\" made me stop what I was doing and just...listen. The song nearly moved me to tears - I was that moved.  And then \\"United States of Eurasia\\" made me want to run around in a cape and revolt against something, but then the piano solo at the end (which is fantastic) brought be back to reality - somewhat:).   \\"I Belong To You\\" literally left me with my mouth hanging open.  I felt as if I were walking through the streets of Paris.  Okay, but that's not all.  \\"Exogenesis\\" was like a piece of fresh air.  It took me to a whole different world - one that I didn't want to step out of.  All that said...I have one very important suggestion: listen to the CD from beginning to end without stopping.  It's the only way you can truly understand what Muse is trying to accomplish through this album.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|It's been said that you haven't heard Sgt.Pepper until you've heard the MONO mix. The MONO version is a completely different mix than the stereo. You will hear things on the MONO mix that don't appear on the stereo. For instance, The crowd noise on the opening track and the reprise are completely different. She's Leaving Home is in a different key. There's laughing at the end of Within Without You. Good Morning Good Morning has a many more animal sounds. That's just to name a few. It's a different listening experience. The MONO White album has many of the same differences. The Fab 4 took a greater interest in the MONO mixes. They participated in the mixing. They usually left the stereo mixes to the engineers.
0316010669|2.0|I picked up this book because it had reviews written in the jacket stating that \\"I couldn't put it down\\" by qualified reviewers. Well, I could and did put it down. I skimmed many pages because of boredom and lack of merit.     If you're interested in this topic in general, find another book about developing your intuitive self, because that's really what \\"Blink\\" is about, even though the word intuition doesn't come up...
B00005JPSM|5.0|If you love to cook and enjoy watching romance movies, then you'll like this one. Just watching Catherine Zeta-Jone's character make scallops, creme brulee,cheesecake, and pomme frites with steak, warmed my heart. The part where they eat tiramisu by the fireside made me melt. As I love to cook a great gourmet meal every now and then, watching people cook in this film reminded me of watching The Food Network.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, in the beginning Catherine Zeta-Jone's character is real control freak. She's a talented chef but is extremely anti-social, rude, and arrogant. But then she starts working with a fun and unconventional sous chef who gets her to come out of her shell. Sure they bump heads not to mention ruin a few dinner orders, but in the end it all works out. In addition a wonderful relationship between the main character and her orphan niece develops beautifully.  A great film to enjoy with a bottle of wine on a Friday night.
0061730327|5.0|This is a wonderful story, told by the protagonist himself, the boy who harnessed the wind.<br /><br />Africa is a mystery to me, as it must be to many other Westerners. Most of what I've read was written by outsiders, mostly Westerners who view Africa through Western eyes. This book is an outstanding exception.<br /><br />William Kamkwamba grew up in Malawi, suffering with the rest of that country through famine and poverty. He's inquisitive, intelligent, highly motivated, and doesn't get discouraged. He's a lot like the successful people we all know, except he doesn't have any of the opportunities that we enjoy; most notably, his village doesn't have electricity. As the title implies, William succeeds in building a windmill, and bringing the benefits of electricity and wind power to his village.<br /><br />I was continually amazed by the what William had to do to accomplish his goal. He scoured science books written in English to learn the basic principles, looking up unfamiliar words one by one. He spent months salvaging parts like motors, wire, nuts and bolts from a junkyard, and dug PVC pipes out of the ground and heated the plastic to manufacture windmill blades.<br /><br />My only complaint is that more than half the book goes by before the windmill project begins. Although the story of William's childhood is interesting and inspirational, I grew a bit impatient to read the story promised by the title. I would like to rate the book 4.5 stars for that reason, but this is not a serious enough complaint to deduct a full star. Highly recommended to all, especially middle and high school librarians and teachers for use in the classroom.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I have read some really bad reviews about the picture quality of this collection. I really have no issue at all with the picture quality..true its nothing above average but the sound is sensational! and it conatins MANY MANY missing videos by Madonna that had never been released at all before on VHS or DVD! Im happy with my copy..Its like almost four hours of Madonna videos and the quality is not as bad as some claim..True its missing some clips but mostly all the very BEST of the BEST videos are there...plus the other two compilations that she released years ago have basically got some of the videos missing here...so Im happy..[[ASIN:6305459525 Madonna - The Immaculate Collection]][[ASIN:6305610444 Madonna - Video Collection 1993-99]]
0385504225|1.0|This insipid book was painful to finish. The research assistants were charged with finding as much Masonic history as possible, along with a summary or overview of ancient religious symbols to which Dan pasted an incredulous screenplay of a plot. REFUND owed!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book was very disappointing.  Brown delivers a good page turner as his story unfolds.  No real complaint there.  But the end?  It's not quite as bad as one of those stories where someone wakes up in the end from a dream so none of it happened.  But this book contains several murders and involves a high-level CIA official, the architect of the U.S. Capitol and the head of the National Cathedral in a frantic effort to stop a terrible threat to national security and a revelation that will change the course of human history -- perhaps, gasp, with dire consequences.  But once Brown has peeled this onion to its core, there's nothing there.  Yawn.  I guess it doesn't matter if you produce a weak book if you've become famous enough that your publisher knows it will sell.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|The songs don't flow like the vinyl. For example there is gap from SGT Pepper's lonely hearts band to With a little help from friends. The vinyl version flows right into the song were as the CD there is a silent gap.<br /><br />The packaging is nice  and yes it's better that the CD versions from 20 years ago. But the Vinyl version is still better.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I really like Dan Brown's other two books, but this one was such a let down. Don't waste your money...it's just not worth it. I felt like I was being preached to, throughout the book... It was a slap in the face, over and over again...I felt like he thought the reader wasn't very bright, so he kept saying the same things over and over again. I cannot recommend this book.

There is some impressive cinematography to be sure, but this movie is a five star train wreck.<br /><br />It boggles the imagination that anyone wasted the time or money to make this movie, and it further boggles the imagination that anyone would've liked it, let alone given it any awards.  It rambles aimlessly for an agonizingly long almost two-and-a-half hours, ends abruptly without going anywhere, and leaves you just feeling numb and confused about what you've just been through.<br /><br />The story line in extremely poor, the dialogue is tired (at best) and Daniel Day Lewis's character is just plain weird, as are most of the other characters in this flick.  It's like Tarantino took a shot at trying to make a big screen epic.<br /><br />This thing's awful, all the way around, and my copy will end up in the next garage sale.  Avoid this one at all costs.
0385504225|3.0|I pre-ordered my copy of The Lost Symbol months before the release date (like millions of other fans, I suppose).  I thought I had secured the best deal possible (a whopping 60% off RRP!).  In reality I could have gotten it a day earlier and a dollar cheaper if I had just sauntered over to Target and picked up a copy.  But, let's not split hairs -- a good book is always worth the wait and the extra buck.<br />However, I guess I was in for more reality shock.  After six years in the making, The Lost Symbol is no better than The Da Vinci Code.  It is a fair companion for the beach or that long plane trip or a few sleepless nights.  There are some unexpected turns and twists and some interesting esoterica to Google later on, if you're into that.  But it is overlong, overwrought and clunky overall.  There are much too much explanations on explanations.  The pattern of dialogue is repetitive to the point of annoying. A bit of spirited and principled editing could have reduced it by a third and not lose the plot.<br />I don't want to give the impression that The Lost Symbol is terrible -- it is a fairly competent thriller, comparable to The Da Vinci Code.  But, I was expecting more from Dan Brown this time around, unfortunately.

1439102813|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book as I just did not want to be depressed.  I was surprised how inspiring this book was.  It is beautifully written and one of those books you hate to put down.  It is a book more about early Alzheimer's than late onset, the latter of which most people suffer.  I'm not sure how realistic it is for many caregivers and their experience.  But what it does do is encourage us to continue to look at the person afflicted with Alzheimer's as the person that we love and that there is still beauty to be found in the experience of caring for our loved ones.

0385341008|5.0|I loved this book. The backdrop of post-war England was fascinating. The historical information--I had no idea Guernsey was occupied by the Germans--was fascinating. The structure was clever and well done. It made me laugh. Most of all, the characters were well drawn, fully developed, lovable people. Feel good with some depth.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Mad Human Disease: who knew it would take only one infected burger-bite to bring forth the annihilation of the entire country? For, as the hero of the story narrates, you cannot have a country without people, and there are no people left... Then, what do you do when you are the only one left alive? Well, you embrace denial, and HOPE. Convinced his parents have survived, our hero charges forth hoping to find them in Columbus, OH (well, more like, he walks away with a suitcase). He crosses paths with three other incidental survivors and they, HIGHLY reluctantly, form a unit. Living on borrowed time and weary not to bond with one another, they take on the names of their destinations. And so, we have our loner and hero Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg of Adventureland); the master redneck zombie killer Tallahassee (the brilliant Woody Harrelson, as always, balancing on the verge of sanity); a pretty con artist Wichita (Emma Stone of Superbad), and her 12 year old accomplice Little Rock (an almost grown up Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine).<br /><br />Self admittedly, the makers were influenced by the work of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead). However, when considering to which other movies I could compare Zombieland, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle immediately comes to mind. As in that film, all Zombieland (human) characters are involved in a zany quest for their own personal holly grail, be it a luscious golden Twinkie for one, or an amusement park for another. For geeky Columbus, the holly grail of his life is a girl of his own. Unsurprisingly, he finds her in the tough chick Wichita (after all, choices are scarce for either one of them). Yes, they must battle hordes of naughty zombies to fulfill their quest, and do so in the most entertaining and hilarious fashion (to give you an idea, one scene involves a nun and a piano). But, zombie killing is secondary to the stories of personal journeys. Just like Harold and Kumar, while the World remains unchanged, each of our characters undergoes a transformation that forever (as short as that may be) alters who they are as a person.<br /><br />I can honestly say Zombieland is the funniest movie I have seen this year. As a comedy, it delivers more laughs then perhaps even Hangover, and can definitely be counted as one of the funniest zombie films EVER made. There is only one problem. Somewhere in the third part the film morphs from a zombie comedy into a romantic comedy. I was unprepared for that change of pace and somewhat resentful that the zombie centric fun was being taken away. Hence the four, rather then five stars. Still, I recommend the film wholeheartedly to anyone who desires a bit of innocent zombie gore with a high dose of humor and some romance thrown in...<br /><br />Enjoy!acters undergoes a transformation that forever (as short as that may be) alters who they are as a person.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|This was a very good movie based on the book by the same name. It is a little graphic as far as violence goes, and I did have to look away a few times, but the story line was excellent, and Renee Zellweger did a bang-up job as Ruby. In fact, here part, along with Jack White's were probably the best part. Nicole was a little off in this one, but Renee was in top form.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|I saw this at the theatre 3 times.  It is so funny.  I was laughing out loud all through the movie.  This is not a chick flick.  Lots of men were in the theatre with me and they were laughing louder than me and my girlfriends.  The acting doesn't get much better than this.  The director has to be pleased with this one because these actors showed up knowing just what to do.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were so good together.  Ryan was great even when he wasn't speaking.  Just his facial expressions were hysterically funny.  He also gave singing a try which was even funnier.  Betty White played his grandmother and was as good as ever.  Sandra and Ryan try hard not to like each other but it just didn't work.  Sandra Bullock looks great.  Girl can't help it, she is just too pretty.  I don't write much about the story because it is described on the Amazon listing and I don't want to spoil anything.  Go watch this movie.  It is the comedy of the year.  I like spontaneous type comedy and not fake made up comedy and The Proposal is just that.  You will watch this movie over and over.
0385504225|2.0|I knew that \\"The Davici Code\\" would be a tough act to follow, especially with all of the books and movies that have tried to capitalize on that genre since the Davici Code came out. I thought the book started slow (for the first couple hundred pages or so) and then picked up some speed. It slowed down considerably after the evil character (for lack of a better term) finished his part and I've now spent the last three days trying to get through the last 40 or so pages. I can't see this being made into a movie. If it is I would likely go see it just to see the sites in Washington but it certainly wouldn't be for the story.

B00000269M|5.0|I bought this album as soon as it came out when I was in the 10th grade. I did not expect it to be as good as \\"Thriller\\" and I was too young to realize MJ was one of the most talented song writers around-how could I under-estimate this album?? Of course, his physical appearance started changing a bit more and a rougher, edgier MJ was progressing. \\"Bad\\" produced five number one singles and was the first album to do this so here we go again with MJ making the record books and it is during this time that Michael was dubbed the \\"King of Pop.\\" The title track, created the new use of the word \\"BAD\\" and I found this song to be a little overbearing, though it is catchy with a strong synthesizer being used, and the video, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a classic. I know, it's almost a sin not to love \\"BAD\\" but this is not my favorite song on the album. Great pop tunes such as \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" and \\"Another Part of Me\\" were both written by MJ himself, and are full of energy and great pop. \\"Another Part of Me\\" was also used in the Disneyland attraction starring MJ \\"Captain EO\\". Beautiful signature ballad \\"Man in the Mirror\\" (written by Siedah Garrett) takes on humanity and asks us to make a change and help others. \\"Dirty Diana\\" is about a seductive groupie, which we all know MJ dislikes, and this song has terrific lyrics written by MJ himself...\\"She Likes The Boys In The Band,she knows when they come to town, every musician's fan after the curtain comes down, she waits At backstage doors,for those who have prestige, who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree...\\"    \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is absolutely addicting and funky and the video is even better.. one of the most unique and best songs on the album and Michael keeps us asking \\"Annie are you ok\\"? Alien Ant Farm covered this in the late 90's too. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is by most accounts, a beautiful song except it was way over-played when it first came out and this ruined its essence for me. Just like every album out there by even the best, there is always a song or two that don't bring the album justice: \\"Leave Me Alone\\" has a good fast beat but the lyrics consist of an angry Jackson lashing out at the media for picking on him. \\"Just Good Friends\\" is sang with Stevie Wonder, forgettable.. \\"Liberian Girl\\" I am undecided on,, though alot of people seem to really like this song. \\"Speed Demon\\" doesn't do anything for me either. Another great album by MJ in his younger days and this is a truly must-have for all Michael Jackson fans.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|This DVD was fixed formated for 4/3 televisions in letterbox. That means if you view it on a 16/9 tv there are black bars on both sides as well as the top and bottom of the screen. You have to watch it with the tv set for 4/3. Viewing it at 16/9 stretches the image so the actors looks like they weight 400 pounds. When viewed in 4/3, you can't zoom the image to eliminate the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen because if you do so much of the image is lost off both sides that it's impossible to watch. Viewed on a 16/9 tv set to the required 4/3 format, the picture only fills the center 40-percent of the screen, which is too small to enjoy even on my 52-inch Samsung. As if all this wasn't bad enough, the quality of the transfer is very poor. The image is so soft that you keep squinting at it in an attempt to sharpen it up.    \\"Emma\\" was a highly regarded movie when released. I can't understand why the studio would distribute such a poor version of it. It would have cost no more to released it as an anamorphic DVD, such as waas done for \\"Sense and Sensability\\", which produces near blu-ray quality images.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|To be honest with you I really hated this book. Well, what I read of it anyway. Don't get me wrong. I think Dan Brown is a brilliant man. I've read all of his other books and found them both interesting and enlightening, but this is one book I really could not finish. For one thing there was nothing likable about any of the characters. I'm supposed to care about this old man who is kidnapped, but I really don't. Plus I agree with another reviewer who stated that Dan Brown phoned this book in. It's almost as if he knew that no matter what he wrote it would be a best seller and that was all that mattered.....
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|...and kind of annoying.    Much has been written about this already, so I'll just say this:    - The major plot twist was TOTALLY obvious VERY early in the book.    - The \\"cliff hanger\\" chapter endings (all 100+!) were completely contrived and manipulative.     - Yes, we know Langdon is a claustrophobic skeptic -- you don't have to tell us over and over and OVER.     Too bad, because I liked the other two books.
0385504225|2.0|I have read all of the Robert Langdon installments of Brown's work and while they have succeeded in giving me a decent amount of entertainment, I don't feel like I've ever really been awed.  Oh sure, the ending of the Da Vinci Code was \\"shocking\\", but at the end of the day it didn't rock my world.  I think the reason for this, especially in the case of this latest installment, is that Brown relies to heavily on the formula he's concocted to drive his plots along the way.<br /><br />Moreover, it just isn't feasible to believe that this one simple college professor has such a wealth of knowledge that he can solve all the world's mysteries with very little help.  In this novel more than others, Langdon came off as highly pretentious and relatively unsympathetic.  This also showed were in the minor characters who were introduced...  Each one had a higher degree of knowledge than the next and by the end of the book it just felt like they were all trying to one-up each other.<br /><br />Which leads me to the ending...  Wow.  Without giving anything away, I'll just say this: It felt like Brown knew he was about to miss a deadline and just said to himself, \\"OK, I just spent 400 pages building up but now I need to find the quickest route from Point A to Point B.  Oh, there it is.\\"  There are hardly words that I can think of to describe how disappointed I was with the last 150 pages or so of this book.  Horrible!
0609610570|1.0|I read this a while back and I must say, if you like to read the ramblings and musings of a narcissist, this one's for you.
B0016BPWNM|1.0|I got roped into watching this with my wifes family because her nieces wanted to watch it. and her sisters and her had also liked it as kids.    most of them still enjoy it, or at least can stand it. I tried my best but about 20-30 minutes in I left, came back somewhere near the middle of the movie and made it another 5 minutes. when I saw adam sandlers \\"going overboard\\" I thought I had seen the dumbest movie. boy was I wrong, Id sit through that movie ten times to not have to sit through this one once.    do yourself a favor and unless you already watched this as a kid and theres a possibility of enjoying it simply for no other reason than nostalgia, stay the .... away from it.
0061730327|5.0|It seems that there is an age at which everything seems possible. You, personally are going to stop global warming. You are going to organize enough people to swing the vote, and then eventually, you will become president of the United States.    For most people, this occurs after that period of time during which you know everything. You have already come to grips with ignorance, and have compensated by turning all of your energy towards saving the world. You plan on compensating for your lack of infinite knowledge through your application of infinite sweat, toil, and energy.    For most people, this ends when you are faced with the reality of finding work, needing to pay rent, purchase health insurance, make a down payment on a house, and start feeding some babies. Now it seems foolish to think that we ever even thought that we could change the world.    Well, I think it was foolish to stop believing you could do it all. I firmly believe that you can. And I have just the book to prove it to you. William Kamkwamba's book \\"The boy who harnessed the wind.\\" Will remind you of your passion. This book will rekindle your fire, provide you with inspiration, and a reminder that anything really is possible.    While many other reviews of this book have focussed on his amazing feat of building a windmill in the drought and famine-struck Malawi, I want to focus on his ability to move hearts, not just dynamos. More than half of his book tells of his childhood growing up in a rural village where magic is a power to be reckoned with (not played with) and lions and leopards prowl the forests.    His story wonderfully portrays a childhood that resonates deeply with our own memories of childhood while providing a beautiful glimpse into an alien world. It puts human faces on the frequently abstract continent of Africa. This in itself is praiseworthy. Kamkwamba doesn't just tell a cross-cultural tale. His coming of age story emerges slowly at first: as his neighbors start to skipmeals, you realize that this is not your childhood story. By the time he and his family are fighting over four bites of wheat mush, it is too late: tears are filing your eyes, as you keep turning page after page, the only solace knowing that this story must have a happier ending.    The description of extreme hardship is not overly painful to read; it is quite matter of fact. For William and his family, crying and feeling sorry for yourself, or focusing on the hunger only made it worse. It was merely a fact of life that everyone's cheeks were sunken and that hunger and distended bellies could take anyone's life.    This is not a TV commercial asking you for money. That would be easy to write off. Instead, this account draws you in as a complicit observer: where were you when this was happening? Surely, you weren't fighting with other skeletons in line to buy the very last reserve of wheat. You have become part of William's family, full and contented while the rest of them are lying down to combat their hunger pains. If this does not rekindle your desire to seek justice in the world, to fight to end poverty and government corruption, then you must have been skipping chapters looking for the windmill.    Once your desire to help all Mulawians in some way is emblazoned, William gives you hope. With empty belly, he begins to educate himself. By taking apart radios and reading books, he climbs heights.    The rest of the story has been covered already. For me the magic of William is his ability to bring the reader into a foreign world without feeling like an outsider, showing their destitution while at the same time showing their strengths, determination, and intelligence. He made me more compassionate. I think this book belongs in school curriculum around the world.    I hope you read it. And then do something.

B001GM28HO|5.0|why can i say? lady gaga is cool. i love her style. she sounds alot like gwen stefani and pink while her style<br />reminisce those stars in the 80s. she's sexy and all but i didn't love all the songs on her album. At first, I thought some were just fillers and there was nothing spectacular about them, but they grew on me. most of the songs are about partying, being famous, and sex. yea, new york does sounds like fun. so basically she is saying that she parties like a rockstar and screw like a porn star. i can't really say that she has alot of relatable songs for everyone who has that kind of lifestyle but most of the songs here do sound fun to dance to. she sounds better than most dance artists out there...including britney spears, i'll give her credit for that. for this review, i'm going to write about my thoughts on each song. I think The Fame was a much more cohesive album than Born This Way. Born This Way just felt too preachy and condescending. I appreciate The Fame more for its simplicity because it was all about the music rather than her pretentiousness. Also, The Born This Way era was just atrocious. The looks and the videos. I hated it.<br /><br />1) love game- \\"let's have some fun this beat is sick..i wanna take a ride on your disco stick\\". that part is classic and i love her look in the video. it's very flirty and got a hook to it.  5/5<br /><br />2) Paparazzi-love the song...i guess you can it's about being crazy over a guy.  5/5<br /><br />3) eh, eh(nothing else i can say)-very cute song. i like how the video displays her italian heritage. she looked really cute in that video. eh eh eh...there's nothing else i can say. 5/5<br /><br />4) poker face-  The intro music sounds so classic.

B002LVVCIK|4.0|Just as thought-provoking, clever, and humorous as his previous documentaries, Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story turns its disapproving eye to the title economic system and its disastrous effects on people across America. As the film progresses and we're shown numerous examples of families thrown out of their houses, factory workers laid off without warning, and taxpayers shelling out billions to bail out banks, it becomes apparent that capitalism itself isn't to blame, but rather the avaricious few who abuse the policies and corrupt those in power. As it exposes the guilty further lining their pockets, it also offers plenty of hope, emphasizing the minor and major rebellions that prove that change is just around the corner. And for many frightened CEO's, so is Michael Moore, with his intimidating microphone and a demand for answers.<br /><br />No stranger to tackling the big issues, documentarian Michael Moore takes on capitalism and the reasons behind America's recent economic \\"meltdown\\". Beginning in Rome and bringing us up to date with the recession, the purported evils of capitalism are compared to everything from vultures to Vegas casinos, and its negative impact blamed for death profiteering, predatorial bank lending, and the eventual downfall of democracy. But with the depressing realizations of a good system gone wrong, Moore invokes his trademark brand of clever humor, creative editing, and a little grandstanding pizzazz.<br /><br />Michael Moore has reached a point of notoriousness that unfortunately prevents his opposition from ever seeing his material. Sadly, only those who admire his political viewpoints are likely to see Capitalism: A Love Story, and those who despise his ostentatious methods will avoid it outright. While his style of documenting facts is slanted at best, the way he edits his films is fascinating and highly entertaining. Instilled with plenty of humor, the largely depressing topics become resoundingly more absorbable, and are unquestionably important. Grand, thundering music highlights his focal points, frequently increasing the hilarity or aiding in the finger-pointing. At times it's thrilling, tear-jerking, comedic, and thought-provoking, but always educational.<br /><br />Capitalism is essentially the pursuit of the American Dream and it didn't set out to be evil. It was a good intention that only spiraled downward when it started to negatively control democracy. The rich want to stay rich, so the poor have no choice but to stay poor. Too bad the rich control the government and getting a piece of the wealth pie requires deciphering the foreign language of Wall Street. Moore presents many stances on democracy, socialism, taking advantage of others' misfortunes, profit motives, free enterprise, employers profiting on the deaths of their workers, propaganda, the Senate Housing Committee's failure to police mortgage scams and other white collar crimes, and bail outs, but ultimately the real villain is self-indulgence, consumption and greed. And for that there is no cure.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsmportant. Grand, thundering music highlights his focal points, frequently increasing the hilarity or aiding in the finger-pointing.

Moore presents many stances on democracy, socialism, taking advantage of others' misfortunes, profit motives, free enterprise, employers profiting on the deaths of their workers, propaganda, the Senate Housing Committee's failure to police mortgage scams and other white collar crimes, and bail outs, but ultimately the real villain is self-indulgence, consumption and greed. And for that there is no cure.    - The Massie Twins
0061719544|5.0|I have to say that I pre-ordered this book in order to get it quickly after it came out.  I love watching Craig Ferguson on his late night show and did wonder how he came to be here and what all he had been through.  The book is a pleasure to read.  I have an alcoholic son and this book has also helped me understand that condition a little better.  Thanks, Craig for a wonderful book and I'm glad you are an American citizen!
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Zombies seem to be the recent creature of choice for everything from bloody horror to romantic comedy. Zombieland knows this, and wisely opts to bypass the bothersome territory of explanation and resolution of the ill-fated condition to focus solely on the unexpected hilarity that arises and the subsequent sadistic fun of exterminating the undead masses. Losing the typical scares is more refreshing than disappointing as the comedy stays clever and witty throughout, and the whole wild ride never dips into depressing seriousness or blatant reality (except for one major cameo). Though the story of finding family and Twinkies amidst the zombie-infested wastelands of the world is hardly dull, the steady attention to a series of fantastically escalating dismemberments does divulge the film's true intentions. But it'll be a long time before watching zombie evisceration loses its entertainment value.<br /><br />In a world ravaged by zombies, young loner, unlikely survivor, and virginal shut-in \\"Columbus\\" (Jesse Eisenberg) overcomes his fears and extreme surroundings by following a strict list of survival rules (including regular cardio, never skimping on bullets to the head, and avoiding bathrooms). Columbus soon learns that rules were meant to be broken when he finds himself entangled in the lives of \\"Tallahassee\\" (Woody Harrelson), a hardened traveler and expert zombie killer, and beautiful con artist \\"Wichita\\" (Emma Stone) and her twelve-year-old accomplice \\"Little Rock\\" (Abigail Breslin). Now, as he heads to California caught up in his newfound friends' bizarre quests for Twinkies and zombie-free amusement parks, Columbus might just find the \\"family\\" he's always been looking for.<br /><br />Zombieland sports the same appeal as Dawn of the Dead, although the distinguishing level of horror has been almost completely replaced with humor. Lone warriors trapped in the harsh environment of big city ruins allows for total freedom, no rules, and adventurous endurance tactics that inspire fantasy and mischievousness. The desolation and isolation are still marginally scary, but the nonstop rollercoaster (literally) thrills and unadulterated, cutthroat comedy is a captivating combination.<br /><br />The setup is quick and simple, attributing the plague of the 21st century to an unexplained virus. Since the search for a cure or a solution to the zombification of the world is never even hinted at, the film doesn't have to spend precious time suspending disbelief. The zombie-filled cities are merely a backdrop for an epic hunt for a Twinkie, and the understanding and acceptance of a dire situation. With countless activities to do in Zombieland, diabolically funny escapades run amok, complete with spectacular gore, creative cursing, outrageous slow-motion ransacking, a modest amount of romance and a tour of the palatial Bill Murray estates.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsasy and mischievousness.

B001IHJ97E|5.0|The concept of this movie is great, although it plays through with a normal storyline; genius' invent something, government takes it, genius' get revenge.  Christopher Walken, Natalie Wood, Louise Fletcher and Cliff Robertson are fantastic actors, one and all, and make this movie believeable.  The ending will remind you of a Stanley Kubrick epic but how else would you put it?  This is a fun movie and worth watching a couple of times to get everything.
B000002QWD|5.0|I remember listening to this album in the late 1950's. I've never gotten tired of these songs by Bing Crosby. I could not imagine the Christmas Season without listening to this CD.
045122499X|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. In fact, I wanted to live in it. I really liked the female doctor character, Caris. (She wasn't technically a doctor because such opportunities weren't available to women at the time, but she was essentially a doctor despite technically being a nun). The politics at the cathedral seemed believable to modern-day audiences. All the scheming and back-stabbing was similar to many a modern workplace. I liked the market scenes, the details about cloth-making, the details about engineering the bridge, the plague scenes, etc. In fact, I liked everything about this book. I bought it in hard-copy and for the iPhone Kindle app, so I always had it with me.
0385504225|5.0|I loved this book!  I was obsessed w/reading and finishing it.  Lots of twists.  I think Dan Brown is an excellent author.  I had read all his books and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  I highly recommend The Lost Symbol.  I do wonder how the author comes up with this stuff....this book is bizarre!!!
B000UG4LYU|5.0|Talk about slipping through the cracks: I've encountered devout Bowiephiles who don't know about this album. More's the pity for them. Recorded for a British TV mini-series in 1993, this album seems to exist in many forms in the United States, with many covers. Whatever the cover, the music is what matters, and the music is excellent.     There is no radio-friendly Bowie ala \\"Let's Dance\\" or \\"Blue Jean\\" here, nor even a semblance to the more conceptual Bowie of \\"Outside\\" or \\"Heathen.\\" This is ambient Bowie, clearly showing the Brian Eno influence and ahead of the post-rock curve. The title track and \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" (which Bowie re-recorded for \\"Outside\\") have a fairly mainstream appeal, but the rest is ethereal, moody, dark, and largely without vocals. It's a different side of Bowie, and one well worth exploring even if you're not a fan of the better-known artist. I particularly recommend \\"The Mysteries,\\" which takes several listens but eventually becomes utterly hypnotic. It has become one of my favorite pieces of music.

B00003CXB4|1.0|I bought this overpriced DVD for my granddaughter's birthday and it skips continually and would not play in her portable DVD player or in the car DVD player.  This definitely was not worth the money.
B0029LHW4U|2.0|All I can say, after having finally buckled down & listened to the album, is that it sounds more like a continuation of Jerry Cantrell's solo music (w/ an extra singer), FAR MORE than it sounds like Alice In Chains... musically... in every respect.      Furthermore, I REALLY wanted to like this (would've settled for \\"liked\\" rather than \\"loved\\", because hey, it's Alice In Chains)... but there are only 2 or 3 songs that are even worth listening to again; and even those (again) are nothing like AiC songs..... and (again) sound just like the J.C. Boggy/Degradation releases.  I literally can't notice the difference; & wouldn't know the 2 other Original Members of AiC were back.... musically, a continuation of J.C.'s solo stuff... not AiC... can't say it enough... and can't for the life of me understand all this \\"Triumphant return of Alice in Chains\\" stuff.... because it's not Alice in Chains, by any stretch of the imagination (other than the name & 3 members playing).      Each song is as generic as the next & none even musically have the grit or energy that the prior AiC releases had.  Again, nothing here reminded me of AiC... most of all the new singer...      The new singer:    Again, I really wanted to give this guy a chance.... & I knew going in, that Layne is Layne... HE'S IRREPLACEABLE... he was one of a kind; & there will never be a suitable \\"duplicate\\" voice out there... only \\"pretenders\\"... and from the Range & Depth of this new singer's voice... I can't imagine they had much Voice-Rich-Talent to choose from in that regard; but anyway... with this album aside (and I wouldn't even want to see these songs performed live anwyay)... but this album aside... this guy will NEVER be able to pull off, even a DECENT rendition of Any Song from \\"Facelift\\"!      I had to listen to \\"Facelift\\" immediately after this album ended, just to wash the Phony AiC out of my ears.... and it was then, that it really hit me:    1) As much as I'll want to, I'll never be able to see theseguys live... because EVERY single song is going to be butchered beyond all belief; & I just can't take that.    2) That's precisely why the 3 Members of AiC knew, in their core/gut, when Layne died, that AiC was no more... because Layne is irreplaceable.  As much as it pains me to say it, he's Not a Cliff Burton, Dave Mustaine, etc..... when those Metallica members died/left... the band endured (and got better).  This was, & still is the case, with Layne & Alice in Chains.    3) Since this musically/phonically sounds like a continuation of J.C.'s solo stuff... that's what it should have been (w/, or w/o the extra singer).  What I mean by \\"phonically\\"... the songs are sung in J.C.'s style... not Layne's style... which means, either the new singer doesn't have a style... or he didn't bring it to the table, so to speak (or was made to conform to J.C.'s style)..... however you want to look at it, when you listen to it, unless you're delusional (or haven't listened to an AiC album in a decade), then you'll probably agree w/ everything I've just said.  (and if you've never heard J.C.'s solo stuff... it's not too bad... soft/mellow blues... better if you're not 'sober' if you know what I mean... but if you listen to it, you'll immediately identify w/ what I'm saying)      Nice Jerry Cantrell album... \\"Degradation Trip Vol. 3\\" maybe... but not Alice in Chains.  Buy it on that precept & you'll be happy... buy it expecting an Alice in Chains album (let alone a decent Layne'ish voice), & you'll be sorely disappointed.  2 Stars because of the false advertisement & hype-up of a new AiC album.  Hey, J.C., letting your solo drummer & bassist go & bringing in your old buddies, & a new one, doesn't make it AiC, if you're going to play the same J.C. solo-stuff, & not revert back to the AiC-Style music.

Still a huge fan but dissapointed.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Let's be clear, I don't think this is a \\"bad\\" album. For a band like U2, even their weakest albums are still pretty good. But it's fair to say that this is the \\"least great\\" U2 album. It was billed at the time as an even more experimental album than 'Zooropa', but in fact it represents a pullback from that album. Rather than continue their self-consciously ironic direction, parts of 'Pop' return to the social and religious themes of the band's 80's work. In addition, several songs are more anthemic, fueled by guitar riffs rather than dance beats. The idea seems to be to merge the anthemic passion of 'War' and 'Joshua Tree' with the experimental music of 'Zooropa'. It's a nice idea in theory, and it worked beautifully with 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. But on 'Pop', the execution was flawed.     In some ways, 'Pop' reminds me of REM's 'Up', in that it contains some reflective, thought-provoking songs that would have been better suited to a stripped-back arrangement. The dance beats and studio effects just don't suit the lyrical concerns of 'Mofo', 'If God Will Send His Angels' or 'Wake Up Dead Man'. 'Please' gets by solely because it is such a great song, no number of string and keyboard effects can ruin it (although they try!). And as for 'Miami' and 'Playboy Mansion'....let's not even go there. I don't know what they were trying to do with those songs, but I'm glad they haven't tried it again since.    The best moments are where U2 actually succeed in matching the music to the lyrics. The opener 'Discotheque' at least captures the sense of fun and irony present on 'Achtung Baby' and 'Zooropa'. The three rock-oriented songs 'Staring At The Sun', 'Last Night On Earth' and 'Gone' work because of their simpler, less cluttered arrangements. And the ambient, seductive 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' is one of the best songs here. It's just a pity a couple of the other songs weren't given as much room to breathe.    Nowadays, U2 take 4-5 years between albums, and it's hard not to wish the band had held off on 'Zooropa' until around 1995-6. Some of the better songs from the 'Zooropa' sessions could then have been mixed with the best few tracks from 'Pop', and U2 would have had another classic. As it stands, 'Pop' is still a reasonably good album, but the rather haphazard implementation of some of its new ideas means it is their least consistent.

B001I05ZVK|5.0|Christensen writes about the failure of good, well-managed companies to stay atop their industries when they are confronted by certain types of disruptive market and technological change. This has happened in industries that move fast and those that move slow, and in manufacturing and service industries. Companies that fell prey to these disruptive changes include Sears, IBM, DEC, Xerox, and integrated steel manufacturers.<br /><br />What is a 'disruptive technology?' A new approach that few, if any, current customers want, but possibly offers new applications and eventually higher performance - eg. smaller, more expensive data discs that offer nothing to existing customers but might work in new, unknown volume applications. The new technology's potential volumes aren't attractive to management (don't meet their immediate growth needs), the opportunity is ignored and the developers eventually become frustrated and leave to join a smaller firm that is interested, or start their own. Often eventually the new technology outperforms the old, allowing those that have developed and utilized it to not only pursue the new applications but have an advantage in pursuing the old users.<br /><br />Christensen defines \\"sustaining\\" technologies as those that improve the performance of established products along dimensions that major customers have historically valued. \\"Disruptive\\" technologies, on the other hand, generally under-perform established products in major markets but have new features that a few new/fringe customers value - generally smaller, cheaper, simpler (eg. PCs, discount retailing, off-road motorcycles, transistors, and HMOs).<br /><br />Disruptive technologies, when viewed by \\"rational\\" decision-makers, offer lower margins (due to their generally cheaper and simpler nature), are first commercialized in new or small markets (thus, they don't solve large corporations' growth needs), and are not valued by major, current customers. Thus, they wait for new market entrants to exploit their potential, and the strong, existing firms risk becoming obsolescent due their being late to change.ir potential, and the strong, existing firms risk becoming obsolescent due their being late to change.

B002BFIN6K|5.0|The Greatest Rachmaninoff  by JD Smith     I got this call out of the blue from a guy from North Carolina who said he read a review I wrote for a Debussy recording of piano rolls the composer did for several years right up till his death- shortly before the end of World War I.  The recordings were and are significant because they were the ONLY actual recordings of the man himself, who also happens to be my favorite composer.  The gentleman who contacted me was John Q. Walker and has a significant importance in the future of recording.   Actually, he might have read a review I did of a CD called, \\"The Gods Are In the House\\", which featured recordings of Art Tatum, Fats Waller and James P. Johnson- arguable 3 of the greatest jazz pianists of all time.  This would largely be aimed at Art Tatum, since the title of this particular CD was a reference to something someone said once that was picked up and used in reference to Art when he would walk into any of the (at that time) small jazz clubs that existed along 48th street in New York during the 40s and 50s.  These small (understatement in size) were significant mainly for musicians back then as they were really an all night and into the day (at times) haven for when jazz musicians, black and white could get together and play the real music they wanted to play without fear of prejudice or their lives due to the mixed race input of these legendary and mostly unrecorded sessions.  At one time, this street actually had 27 jazz clubs on it.  Jazz musicians would generally escape from their usual drudge to one of these small hang outs and let loose some inspiration or steam and maybe get a quick meal and a few drinks before they would have to get back to their jobs or wherever they would end up sleeping after the sessions.   The \\"Gods...\\" CD has old record transcriptions performed live and solo by James P. Johnson, Fats Waller and Art Tatum.  Johnson is possibly the greatest stride pianist of his time and also possibly the greatest composer of rag time songs.  He has been unfortunately overlooked because his music wasn't used in the movie, \\"The Sting\\" which helped to make Scott Joplin reborn again.  Fats Waller was a great composer and entertainer.  He was a great stride pianist- one of the best although he confessed several times that his favorite instrument was the organ.  I think he knew and felt the superior technology of that instrument over the piano.  Art Tatum was arguably the greatest jazz pianist who ever lived.  Buddy Rich, one of the greatest jazz drummers who played with him on Tatum's last recordings said he thought Tatum played too fast and at time erratic until he heard the recordings back and realized that while he was so fast with his playing, he always came back on time on the 4th line of his solo.  Rich would scratch his head and struggle at times to keep right on the beat that Tatum was always on.   The technology of the aforementioned CD I'm speaking about concerns a guy who, strictly as a hobby took piano transcriptions and via some computer program process was able to transfer these recordings to a disc where all the notes and nuances could be obtained. Then using those discs transfer that information to whatever piano had the process of playing it back.  Only of course, without the compressed scratchy surface of an album and on (if possible) the finest grand piano.  So in a way, it would be a second generation piano roll, only nothing is lost or changed and depending on the piano, everything could be gained.  It took a few years, but eventually his work made it to the \\"Gods\\" CD.      So, getting back to Mr. Walker, he informed me that his company, Zenph and through Sony had just finished a CD  of old Rachmaninoff recordings that now sound gloriously new. I asked him about doing any of the existing Gershwin records and he said that is looking into that as well as other productions on the board.  He was going to send me a copy of the Rachmaninoff CD.  The irony here for me is that I just finished downloading onto I Tunes roughly 5 CDs of all original Rachmaninoff recordings out of a 10 CD set about a week before his call.  I only downloaded Rachmaninoff's original compositions as the others were his interpretations of other composers.  Me, being the snob that I am only wanted his own compositions on I Tunes.   Why all or any of this would be of interest to persons who like other musics, I know this is leading to a breakthrough in further recording achievements.  It always bothered me for decades as to why audience recordings of rock shows or other performances- the individual instruments couldn't be isolated and then transferred to a digital track to be transferred again to a specific piano, guitar and/or drum and then remixed for a new playback experience.  By knowing that it is now being done with a piano performance from an old scratchy record, I see the light of such a new technology growing to do such a thing sometime in the near future.     True to his word, Mr. Walker indeed sent me an advance copy of the \\"Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff\\" CD and if there ever was a perfect piano performance, THIS is IT.   If you compare the original transcriptions to this new production, or what we sound engineers call \\"A-B...ing\\" the two, you just can't hear the difference at all in the actual performance- EXCEPT that the new production sounds like it was recorded yesterday in full digital, but carefully produced warm, clear and up front sound.  If this is a dream come true or long in coming, then this is IT.   I think the only drawback, if not confused part of this CD is that it features 2 different mixes- or microphone placements.  One is specified as the \\"Stereo Version\\" while the other is the \\"Binaural Stereo Version-The Ultimate Headphone Experience\\"- as they call it.  I gave careful listen to both versions and both times solely through headphones and found little difference between the 2.  In fact, through headphones I preferred the first \\"Stereo Version\\".   The one thing that bothered me about both the Debussy piano roll CDs was that the piano seems to be about 20 feet away in a mid size room.  This reminded me of a discussion I had with a friend of mine who does DJ work mostly for weddings and parties.  Knowing the size of my collection (I have all kinds of musics), he used to ask if I had any specific artist that he could use at his gigs.  A few times I tried to let him take some live performances of the artists he wanted to use and he told me he ONLY wanted the studio recordings.  When I asked why, he told me that the live recordings in usually large rooms where he played his CDs were usually too live for the room and the sound, even with the recording quality top notch would always sound muddy because of too much reverb or room/venue ambiance in the recording.   This really made sense to me, especially in the case of the Debussy piano roll recordings.  It all made me realize that the closer the microphones are set for any such recording, the more accurate to whatever room you play it in will be what both the artist and current producer should hope for in terms of absolute accuracy.  In other words, if the piano/recording is played in a small room, that sound will be what it would be like in a small room.  If, however you play the recording in a large venue or hall, the accuracy of the performance will be the same, only in a larger scale due to the size of the room and not displayed with a secondary ambiance besides the room you're playing the recording in.     But damn anything that might seem negative on this CD.  You can listen to and prefer either one version over the other.  It's just wonderful and to me- absolutely definitive.  In other words, if you're going to have ANY Rachmaninoff recording, THIS is....again....IT.
0385504225|1.0|Wow ! Could this book have worse. It was outrageously horrible. I have my own theory about creation of this novel. Dan and his publisher decided to write a new thriller. They found a secret way to do this. They created a secret chamber inside publisher building. In that building they designed and installed a secret blender with mystic symbols on it. They put \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"The Vinci Code\\" for 13 days while the blender was rotating at an angle of 33 degree. After 13 days, a old secret ritual are performed and video shooting was done with high ISO setting so that the final video is grainy with muffled voices. After the ritual the publisher's staff who were wearing pure white cloth created out of baby rabbit fur applied special chemical to the blended papers inside the belnder and poured the content inside a machine which was created by technologies used by CIA to create a 509 pages and they binded that book in pure black hard cover and publisher and Dan were astonished to see that book. Since they lost many symbols from the The DaVinci Code book in blender they called this book as the \\"The Lost Symbol\\"    I read all books by Dan, I liked all of them but this one. I mean it was horrible read. I am also sad by the sold out reviwers of print media whose reviews appear on back of this book
B001E2JNA6|2.0|This is an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice, and we really enjoyed the DVD version. This Blu-ray edition is a real stinker though, video quality-wise. There's so much buzzing swirling movement in peoples skin and in the sky shots that it's completely distracting, and that's on a 40\\" HDTV. Yuck. I sure hope the studio takes the time for a do-over. This release looks absolutely awful, I'd recommend you stick with the DVD version and await a new transfer for high-def.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|The entire 2nd disc is all \\"The Jacksons\\" (CBS generation) totalling 16 tracks.  That's actually more than the \\"Essential Jacksons\\" or any other compilation has.  I did a lot of research and from what I found there's no compilation of the CBS recordings with more tracks than this one.  All 7 albums by \\"The Jacksons\\" are represented.  My favorite is 'Torture.'  The first disc has 10 \\"Jackson 5\\" songs representing 7 albums as well as 6 Michael Jacksons solo tracks representing 4 albums.  Please beware when importing into iTunes, the default has \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" as by \\"Jackson 5.\\"  This is incorrect, it's actually Michael Jackson solo so be sure to modify that.  Excellent compilation!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I received this CD as a gift, and I play it so often...such great talent on this soundtrack! I'm especially impressed with Robert Pattinson's music and have looked up his (and his sister's) recordings. This soundtrack is definitely worth the investment!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|There is some validity to the argument that the new remaster is just louder and that's it - there is nothing earthshaking in the new master - if you enjoy tweaking the sound with the 87 master with Audacity or whatnot to improve it - go for it. But I still recommend this remaster - most people are just looking for a better sounding CD than the 87 version and this is it for sure. It accomplishes the objective - the current stereo mix sounds better on the remaster even if in many cases the sound is only louder. I tweaked with the old version myself and thought I did a good job - but the subtle differences on this remaster trump my efforts---the audible voices in the background on \\"Back in the USSR\\" are much clearer--percussion on \\"Dear Prudence\\" is more notable--you can hear Paul's fingers slide up and down the fretboard on \\"Blackbird\\" as well as Lennon's finger slide on \\"Julia\\" (as well as his taking several breaths during the song) and even Harrison's unintentional string noise on \\"Long Long Long\\". The rhythm guitar is much clearer on \\"Savoy Truffle\\". Paul's great bass line on \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" is much clearer note for note. And John and George's ramblings are much clearer on \\"Revolution 9\\". This song (or sound collage) either soars or suffers depending on your point of view - while several subtle sounds are much sharper - the noise created from all of the splicing and tape loops and console dial tweaking also is present. The only revelation for me was noticing Paul is also joining George at the end of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with the wailing vocals - his voice is so falsetto and buried in the mix - never heard that in all of my listenings of this song. Maybe that's why it sounds like George is wailing \\"Paul, Paul...\\" In a nutshell, again not earthshaking sound but still runs rings around the 87 master and you don't have to attempt to \\"tweak\\" it. Until the much needed remix comes out this will do fine. Packaging is lousy (I almost docked it a star for that) although you do get the poster included with the album in mini format). The mini-documentary is one of the more interesting on this CD - some of these have been quite mediocre on other titles- although it looks at the making of this CD through rose colored glasses and does not mention the extreme tension in the band during the making of the album. If you've never heard the White Album you HAVE to buy it - no other CD can bounce you around between all sorts of music genres so ruthlessly for 90+ minutes and still leave you wanting more.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Abbey Road (one of my desert island CDs) finally gets some decent treatment from Capitol. When the 87 mastered CDs came out for some reason Abbey Road got the shaft. Tape hiss was so notable and sound quality so muddy it was a huge disappointment when I bought this CD is 1987. But this IS Abbey Road and I still played the heck out of the CD. So now we have a 2009 remaster -- is all well with the world again?---almost. Do NOT pay attention to any review that just says this album is louder and not better - this is not true with Abbey Road - it does have some validity with other Beatle albums (most notably the White Album) but that is NOT the case with this album and some pre-1965 ones. The low end is clearer and lower (as in \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\" the bass almost startles because of it's lower Hz clarity). Louder sections of certain songs do not grate your ears as in the 1987 version - they are actually more in line with original Beatle intentions I would believe as the LP does not do that (the middle 8 section in both \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and the vocal on \\"Golden Slumbers\\" for example). Bass notes on \\"Something\\" and \\"Because\\" are clear. The white noise on \\"I Want You\\" no longer overwhelms the music as in the 87 master. In a rare case of \\"fixing\\" errors - Lennon's final scream on \\"I Want You\\" is no longer distorted and the voice that follows that (a source of much speculation on what is said) is buried deep in the mix. The acoustic guitar work of John on \\"Polythene Pam / Bathroom Window\\" has never been clearer - in fact it is so clear that you can hear a likely unintentional late chord strum on \\"Bathroom Window\\" after the first chorus. The two separate drum tracks stand out more on \\"Carry that Weight.\\" The mix just sounds so much clearer that the \\"out of college\\" section of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" spotlights both the high strung piano and the very nimble bass line note for note. The moog and keyboard work on \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" shines(no pun intended). The final guitar lick after \\"The love you make\\" line on \\"The End\\" finally spotlights every note on a very quickly played run (something also notable on the quick guitar licks before the \\"one sweet dream\\" section of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\"). And you may finally notice the tambourine work on \\"Mean Mr Mustard\\". So------------is Abbey Road finally perfect -- nah. If ever an album needed a good remix (aka Yellow Submarine or '1' or Let It Be Naked or even Love) it is this one. The fact that an album can isolate Ringo's great drumming (as good as he ever did with the Beatles) to a left or right channel and even put the bass guitar on a far right or left channel (even more annoying) but still be such a masterpiece is a testament to how strong the songs are on this album. I almost docked this a star due to the lousy packaging - but it does contain photos from some great late period photo sessions and the mini documentary is not bad - some of the remasters have far worse. If you are looking for a starting point for a Beatle CD collection this is as good as any - my own personal Beatle favorite CD. Buy it now and enjoy and hope for a remix in the near future.
0515141429|2.0|\\"The Killing Floor\\" clips along like a freight train: fast-paced, but gosh, after a while it all starts to look very familiar.  The prose is brisk and simple without much embellishment.  The characters are plentiful (nearing a confusing number) and paper-thin.  Examples: Hero Jack Reacher is tough as nails, gets the girl, and is definately the toughest, smartest guy in the room (and doesn't mind saying so, repeatedly, and then some more).  The heroine is the hottest chick in town, doesn't mind a roll in the hay with our guy Reacher in spite of the fact that she was introduced to him while he was behind bars (presumably because, as she said, he has \\"kind eyes\\"), and is generally just along for a vapid ride, not contributing much outside of minds'-eye candy.<br /><br />The plot has a few twists that you'll see coming a few hundred pages ahead if you've seen any mystery movies in the last 15 years, and a few of the twists are painfully contrived (ie: the identity of the first discovered victim), and some of Reacher's out-of-thin-air deductions.  Reacher fancies himself a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, albeit without the plausibility.  Another eye-rolling aspect of the book are the constant repititions of things Mr. Child just told us.  Every time Reacher and Ms. Eye Candy have sex (which seems to be as often as possible), \\"...the 3rd world war could have broken out, and the house could have imploded and we wouldn't have noticed...\\"  (Ugh.)  Mr. Child evidently didn't have an editor that was brave enough to tell him, \\"Uh, Lee, you just said that. Three times.\\"<br /><br />All that said, it's a fast-paced page-turner that provided some decent diversionary reading. I'm hoping that since there have been many Jack Reacher novels published that Mr. Child has honed his craft some (and found himself a better editor). I'm not sure how much \\"The Killing Floor\\" affects future Reacher novel plots (I can't imagine that the sparse details of Reacher's past would need review), but I can't whole-heartedly recommend the book due to its shortcomings. Consider starting with book #2.edly recommend the book due to its shortcomings. Consider starting with book #2.
B00028HBKC|4.0|This has to be the most intelligently made film about Jesus Christ ever.  Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well.  Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material.  This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted.  Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind.  A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point.  To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.<br /><br />Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free.  Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours.  The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery.  If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it!  Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears; all that's said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her.  Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala's flashbacks took away a bit of the film's impact for me.  Having read [[ASIN:0895559765 The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ]] which by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson's last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we'll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it's origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film.  In zealously trying to reclaim \\"orthodoxy\\" and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus.  A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul's journeys.  There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable.  Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library.  Required regular watching for all adult Christians and comes very highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated: 16 April 2012<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I've appended this update here: the Blu-Ray version of the Definitive Edition of this film is a vast improvement over the standard dvd and isnow the optimal version of this film on disc.  The picture quality and especially the sound quality has been improved enough to warrant an upgrade from the standard dvd.  There are now two versions of the film with a slightly shorter and less violent version included as well as the full-length original.

0385504225|5.0|I'm disappointed that the roller coaster ride is over. There were so many twists and turns in this novel. I knew the tattoed man was evil but with several of the other characters Brown had me changing my mind every few chapters. At one point I even suspected the old blind guy. :) I found myself talking to the characters. For instance, when Katherine gave the cab driver the dollar bill on which she'd written I wanted to slap her for being so careless. I too fail to understand how the book got so many negative reviews. For me it was like watching a suspenseful movie and not knowing who the villians were until the very end. Even at the end I was still holding my breath because I wasn't sure of Peter's motives and thought something was going to happen to Robert. I'll be rereading The Da Vinci Code this weekend and then I'm going to revisit The Lost Symbol. I can't believe I want to reread it so soon after finishing it. Hopefully this book will make it to the big screen. I can see it now. The camera pans up to the very tip of the Washington Monument, then slwoly moves down, deep into the earth below to reveal the lost symbol.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This idiot gives and awesome cd one star because he has it in for Dave Mustaine.  What an assclown.  Amazon should delete his review.  I don't like the reviews that rip on Metallica either, because I enjoy listening to both bands.  Both bands have had their ups and downs.  But at least both are back to true form.  Besides it is tasteless to put down someone elses creativity and artistic views.  Cheers Megadeth- Thanks for another fantastic release!!      METALFAN
0385504225|2.0|As I read this novel I kept being reminded of that campy Batman series on TV decades ago.  The Riddler or the Joker would make some incomprehensible rhyme, and Batman would say, \\"Robin, that means this villain is planning to steal the crown jewels of Elbonia on display tonight at the Gotham Museum.\\"  And off the caped cruscaders would race in their Batmobile to thwart the crime.  Pow, Bam.  Batman, I would add, was always on the money with this interpretation of the \\"clues.\\"  And so is our hero in \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"  All he is missing is the cowl and cape and utility belt.    Part of my problem with the book is my distrust of rites and rituals, because they render unnecessary rational thought.  And part of my problem is my inability to accept metaphysical and paranormal explanations for events we have not yet the wit to understand.  When I see the magician David Copperfield walk through the great wall of China, I do not believe he has sold his soul to the Devil--or that there is a Devil--for supernatural powers.  The magician just knows how to made it look as if he has such powers.  I simply cannot accept the mumbo jumbo of noetics, Masonic stage plays, incantations, magic numbers, or Biblical prophesy.    All that aside, the writing in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is just a wee bit--well--bad.  A mansion \\"nestled\\" on a hundred acres was funny and broke whatever spell Mr. Brown was trying to cast.  In fact, there were chiches throughout.  Then there is the abundance of sentences and words in bold type, to make absolutely sure the reader \\"gets\\" it--wink, wink, nod, nod, pay attention to this.  James Patterson also does that, and I find in annoying and even insulting.  A writer needs to write in such a style that the reader cannot help but pay attention and \\"get\\" the point.    One last point about the writing:  at odd times throughout the writer stops the action cold to give the reader a professorial lecture that includes all the research the writer did.  After all, he didn't want it to go to waste.  I could cite many examples, but it just doesn't seem worth it.    The entire plot is ludicrous.  Take a super-villain, tatooed, hairless, castrated, muscled, learned in the arcane arts, and have him commit pitiless acts and perform superhuman feats, one after another.  Pit him against a professor who knows damn near everything there is to know, throw in chase after chase, plus a waifish CIA director, and you have a best seller, but you don't really have anything that lingers long in the brain.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|well, I read some of the bad reviews from the europeans since this article was released earlier in that continent, but I never tought they were that right, this is a trap just to get our money, I got the chance to compare this set with a pirate copy and there is no difference at all between the two of them, exact same video (mis)quality, exact same forced 5.1 stereo sound, I've made this comparisson with a blu-ray player connected to a SONY bravia 1080p via HDMI cable. I'm writting from Costa Rica and this is not the right way to fight piracy in Latin America, what a shame !
B001TKMAGW|4.0|This album is what I consider a \\"must have\\" for anyone.  It shows the magic that four arguably not very special individuals had when they were together.  It isn't even what many hard rock and heavy metal fans would call \\"metal\\".  It is just a fantastic heavy rock album.  Dark and moody, yet catchy and immensely enjoyable.<br /><br />For me one of the best parts is the bass and drums on this album.  Free of any mold that later developed, they are both unconstrained and adventurous.  The only caveat is that production standards of the era meant really deep bass was not considered OK.<br /><br />There are any number of versions of this album you could have bought on CD.  I own, have listened to (a lot!), and examined on sound editors several.  This is my take on them:<br /><br />Early Castle release (1986): Good straight transfer, no volume maxing, limited only by digital equipment of the day and an engineer who presumably knew and cared nothing about Sab, every album he did seems to have at least one track start point wrong! UK track listing, No Wicked World.<br /><br />Early Warners release: Similar to above, but probably transfered from copy tapes, judging by tape hiss and slightly more muffled quality. US track listing, No Evil Woman.<br /><br />Castle Remaster (1996):Probably had the best sound until now, care had been taken to deliver what they thought the market wanted, though the included lyrics were at times hilariously wrong.  Big downfall - volume maxed, at an estimate 5 or 6 dB dynamics removed by software limiting. UK track listing plus Wicked World.<br /><br />As part of The Black Box (2004)(boxed set of 1970's studio albums):  Avoid.  Worst volume maxed copy I've owned.  Incomplete original art work.  Does have booklet with complete approved lyrics.  Not stated what tapes were used so probably US copy tapes again.  US track listing plus Evil Woman.<br /><br />Black Sabbath Deluxe (this CD): Best sounding remaster to date.  Sounds like some equalisation has been used to get a slightly warmer sound across all three \\"deluxe\\" reissues to date, which should attract many people.  UK track listing, Wicked World on bonus disc.<br /><br />So why haven't I given this a 5 star rating?  Mainly because they couldn't stop themselves using just a tiny, little, software peak limiting to get a couple dB's more volume.  Probable inaudible, but why why why....  Please, please can we put volume maxing behind us - it can only loose quality even while initially tricking people that the release is \\"better\\".<br /><br />Also, personally I'd rather they didn't equalise it, just give me a straight copy of the original master tape and then I can do what I like.  But I'm a perfectionist.<br /><br />The bonus disk is also the first time we've seen outakes etc. included, which is great but rather than doing a track for track match-up to the final album (though there are two versions of the title track) I'd rather they gave us a bonus disc crammed with every outtake etc. they could fit.  Mostly I didn't find the bonus tracks add much to the final album, often sounding like nearly finished rehearsals.  Love the horns on Evil Woman though!<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this release to anyone wanting just one good copy of the album.  And everyone should want a good copy of this album!hree \\"deluxe\\" reissues to date, which should attract many people.  UK track listing, Wicked World on bonus disc.

0385504225|3.0|For years I was Dan Brown's fan, his only one.  I have a first edition hardback of Angels & Demons.  And when I had a whole stack of galleys of The Da Vinci Code six months before publication I couldn't give them away.  Well, what a difference the better part of a decade makes.  While I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I didn't enjoy the endless over-the-top hype of the novel and the zillions of Da Vinci clones.  Enough already.  And, truthfully, Brown's religious subject matter really didn't interest me.  So, I can't say that I've been particularly excited about the publication of The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />Yeah, I bought it the day it went on sale, but I was at home sick as a dog with the flu.  The price was right on Kindle, as was the convenience factor, and I was hoping to have the machine read to me as I wasn't quite well enough to tackle the task for myself.  Therefore, I was disappointed after purchase to see the read aloud feature disabled for this novel.  Boo hiss, Doubleday.  Anyway, I eventually got healthier and began to read again and discovered that Dan Brown has finally tackled a subject of real interest to me--my hometown, Washington, DC.<br /><br />As the novel opens, Robert Langdon is literally jetting to DC to give an important speech as a favor to a dear friend.  Rushing to his destination in the US capitol, Langdon discovers the circumstances of his visit to DC are not what he was led to believe.  Soon, he's embroiled in another elaborate, puzzle-filled, life-threatening hunt through the nation's capitol.  He's dodging the CIA, while unraveling arcane Masonic clues, and sparring with a mad man.  In other words, pretty much what you'd expect from Dan Brown.<br /><br />For me, personally, the symbolic tour of Washington, DC was a true joy.  And the ties to the Smithsonian Institution, where I once worked, were an added bonus.  These plot elements had me happily flipping electronic pages all through the first half of this lengthy novel.  I was enjoying The Lost Symbol significantly more than I had expected.  However, the deeper I got into the novel, the less fresh it felt.<br /><br />First, there is the villain, Mal'akh, or whatever he wants to call himself.  It doesn't take the reader long to realize the guy is a complete and total nut job.  And once you get past the more lurid aspects of his character and story, it gets kind of old.  How much crazy do you have to read before it get boring and repetitive.  He's nuts.  We know it.  Move on.<br /><br />Second, Brown again falls back on all his favorite plot devices.  Tricks like referring to characters without using their name, so as to obscure identity as long as possible.  Or having characters have major information that is hidden from the reader.  These things are tricks.  They're used in a heavy-handed manner.  And, again, it all just begins to feel manipulative and old.  Plus, the revelations when they finally, finally come just aren't that exciting.<br /><br />Third, there are plot elements that were supposed to be huge surprises that were just so obvious to me.  I'm not saying that every single reader will pick up on the stuff that I did, but they might have clued into something else.  I'd be surprised if they didn't.<br /><br />So, a mixed reaction from me.  I really enjoy Robert Langdon's lectures.  I think the symbology is genuinely interesting.  Having so much of it revolve around a location I'm intimately familiar with was a special treat for me.  There were a lot of plot elements that were just a lot of fun, and on one level this is a light, entertaining read.  The second half of the book didn't work as well for me.  I think Brown returned to his bag of tricks too often and ultimately revelations disappointed.  For a less critical reader simply looking for a page-turner, you could do worse.antly more than I had expected.  However, the deeper I got into the novel, the less fresh it felt.

0131988425|4.0|I purchased this book as a reference book, since I am perusing my Ph D in signal processing.  To be honest, I haven't used this edition of the book yet, but since \\"Oppenheim and Schafer 2nd edition\\" was a excellent reference to learn digital signal processing, I expect this book to be as good if not better.  Consult reviews of the Discrete-time signal processing 2nd edition to get a better understanding of how this book will be.    The real reason I am giving feedback is to warn potential buyers and resellers about the on-line study guide offered in this book.  This is an attempt of the publishers to get instructors to require that students complete this on-line guide.  By getting instructors to use the on-line guide, they will severely cripple the used-book market since purchasing on-line access to the guide material is 60 to 70 bucks.      You have been warned...

I recommend this book to everyone I talk to. It opened my eyes to the behind the scenes world of food and now makes me think before I buy at the grocery store.  It also offered me a back to basics alternative to vegetarianism and veganism, both of which I was/am practising part-time because it's healthier for me and the planet.  Please read this book, you'll never look at corn and grass the same...  and while you're at it, find a local farmers market...
B001AUKUUO|4.0|White Lion, is a band that is somewhat overlooked as just another 80's glam rock band. I believe that they're much more than just that. Mike Tramp has a voice that may need some getting used too as it is more soft spoken and sweet than rough and tough, but combined with Guitarist: Vito Bratta's heavily influenced on Eddie Van Halen Guitar Playing, there's a pretty good balance of Good Hard Rock mixed with A Hint Of Good Hearted Pop Music.<br /><br />Pride is a good album, but maybe needed a couple more hard hitters (in my opinion) to make it essential.<br /><br />The Album begins with The Hard-Hitting Riffs Of \\"Hungry\\", which has a riff that just grabs you and takes you for the ride of the song, with a solo that to me is mind-blowing and in your face.<br /><br />Lonely Nights is a good follow up, even though it slows down the pace with a mid-paced tempo.<br /><br />The Album continues in this tradition of good pop/rock, with The Singles \\"Wait\\" and \\"Tell Me\\".<br /><br />Overall, A Good Album, that could've been followed by something better had they found the patience and time.

0517548232|5.0|I read this book as a college grad fairly ignorant of economic matters. It completely changed my world view. Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he come over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.    The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you.

In general, though, I don't recommend the film.<br /><br />So why do I want to see the Director's Cut?  I'm curious to see if the extra footage makes a difference.
0385504225|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I didn't want to put it down.  The message Brown was trying to portray really buoyed my spirit as well as he got me to exclaim out loud while reading some of the ending.    I would highly recommend this book, I learned some things as a bonus but overall thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

B00005KARK|1.0|Dear Sirs:  I ordered the Dumbo 60th Anniversary dvd for my grandson's birthday on 9/29, which was sent by Amazon from Okkids.  The dvd arrived in early September, however, since my grandson's birthday was not until 9/29, we did not try to play it until this week.  We tried two different dvd players and the Dumbo movie does not play.  When we insert it into the dvd players, after it runs through all of the previews and we get to the Dumbo movie and press play, the dvd reverts back to the very beginning of the dvd and starts showing all of the previews all over again, and the Dumbo movie does not play.  I wouldn't be sending this note if we did not try two different dvd players, and the same thing happens on both dvd players.  I would like to request a full refund including shipping costs, or please send a new \\"Dumbo 60th Anniversary\\" dvd to me.  I will be happy to mail the original Dumbo 60th Anniversary dvd back to Okkids.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.  Please advise.  M. Hikiji
B002A4Q652|5.0|Delain is simply an amazing band. Charlotte Wessels' voice is clear, refreshing and a pleasure to listen to. She never seems to strugle with the music. The tunes that feature Nightwish's Marco Hietala are especially good and his influence on the riffs are unmistakable. Some reviewers have noted that some of the tunes sound more pop and prog. I agree, but it doesn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this album. After all, I love Nightwish but I don't care for every song on their albums either.    My favorite bands are Nightwish [[ASIN:B000W1V5OC End of an Era]], Within Temptation [[ASIN:B001DPC52C Black Symphony (CD/DVD)]], Lacuna Coil [[ASIN:B00006RINF Comalies]] and Leaves' Eyes [[ASIN:B001OTXM6K Leaves' Eyes - We Came With the Northern Winds - En Saga I Belgia (2DVD / 2CD)]]. I just added Delain to that list! I can't wait till they tour the US.    PS. Another band new on the scene that is definity worth checking out is Memoira. [[ASIN:B001BG2Y0G Memoira]]
B002LANLDK|5.0|It still has a lot of the flash expected from any episode in the Fast & Furious series, but there's more to this movie than eyecandy: The dialogue is surprisingly rich at times, and the acting delivers: you really feel like there's something on the line for each main character, and when Brian has a tough choice to make, you can see it on his face.       As others have said, the plot for this episode is better than the other sequels. It ties into the first movie really well, showing the consequences of what happened in the first movie for all of the characters, eight years later. And, there is a lot at stake for each of the characters,so don't worry: it's not one of those \\"...remember when blah blah flicks\\". Indeed, there isn't a single flashback to anything from the previous movies. Rather, it ties all three films from the franchise together, and shows the complete evolution of FBI Agent Brian's character (Paul Walker), as he once again tries to choose between siding with the law, or with his loyalty to Torrato (Vin Diesel).     Yep, it ties everything together, even Tokyo Drift. So you end up enjoying all three of the previous movies more as you see how this one ties them all together.
B002POVIMS|4.0|been waiting for this release for a while. very 80s retro but not 80s cheesy. can't stop listening to it. usually listen to alternative only but there is something about this cd.
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth is the perfect Darcy. I thought the casting was superb.Jennifer Ehle is lovely as Elizabeth. I loved the pace and the feel of the movie, however I do believe Miss Eliza Bennett's makeup could have been toned down a bit. The reason we all love this couple is epitomized in these performances. It is both comical and tragic at the same time. I own it and watch ir repeatedly.

B002GZQY6Q|3.0|My first 3 listens to this cd had me really bummed.  I heard some theoretically good music, but it wasn't being processed as good in my brain.  After the 6th listen, it has started to gel (i'm trying to learn to listen to a cd about 6 times before i post a review, cuz apparently my aging brain takes longer to absorb music).  While I don't think there are any fantastic songs, there are several good ones:  Blind House, Kneel and Disconnect, Your Unpleasant Family (wish it was longer), Flicker, Black Dahlia, Remember Me Lover.  Drawing the Line has potential, but the chorus is a tad on the annoying side.  No great rockers on here...pretty dark and mellow.      If you're new to PT, try a different starter album like In Absentia.  If you're a PT fan, give it several listens and you'll want to keep it in the mix.

0316017922|4.0|This was an amazing research project as to what makes some people successful, however, the section on Korean pilots was too long and not relevant to me as an educator. The most relevant to me was looking at kids' birthdates and how it forced them into academic or athletic experiences they weren't mature enough to handle.
B000002UAR|4.0|The first two albums I ever bought were Meet the Beatles, and Introducing the Beatles -- when I was 9. After that I believe bought every Beatles album the day it was released. While they are my favorite band -- it doesn't mean I've lost my objectivity about them.        Yes, they were brilliant and the best POP band ever, but they were probably only the 3rd best ROCK band ever -- after Led Zeppelin, the Stones, and maybe Springsteen as well. I say this because, I`m sorry but you simply cannot put the Beatles in the top 10 live ROCK acts. It's not just that the Beatles quit touring too early -- the Stones, Led Zep, Bruce, Jimi, even Chuck Berry were all far, far better performers.      So, I don't say this lightly -- Revolver was nowhere close to the Beatles' best album. It wasn't even in their top 4, maybe not even in their top 5. As an album, which albums do you listen to the most? For most of us it's The White Album, Sgt. Peppers, Let It Be and Abbey Road, and probably even Magical Mystery Tour, too.     Revolver is good, but I never LOVED it. It was always a betwixt and between album. Not quite as bright and poppy as the earlier albums, and not as mature or as enjoyable as the later albums. Is there any song on here that you have to hear today? That ranks as one of their 2-3 best? No, and as an album the songs didn't hang together enough. For me, other than being a transition album to greatness -- Revolver didn't work as a perfect album. It had too many just-ok songs. Consider them song by song.    SONG by SONG:  1) Taxman - 3 stars - interesting sonically but ultimately a boring tax song  2) Eleanor Rigby - 5 stars - very sophisticated lyrically and musically. Not fully lovable, still a mature leap forward about adulthood. 5 stars, but not among their top 10 songs.  3) I'm Only Sleeping -- 5 star - I love this song more today. It grows on you.  4) Love You To - 4 stars - Love the sitar. Probably the first sitar most of us ever heard was on this song. Interesting, good, solid. Not great.  5) Here, There and Everywhere - 3.5 stars - It gets into your head, almost 4 stars. An outgrowth of earlier ballads.  6) Yellow Submarine - 5 stars - Probably the best record on the album was written and performed by ... Ringo!  It's fun and imminently listenable today! (Picture it with Monty Python singing the submarine commands. \\"Skip it, skip it!\\")  7) She Said She Said - 3 stars - Nice hook. Nice song. Like Beatles 65 or Revolver.  8) Good Day Sunshine - 4 stars -  Good positive fun. Bright & uplifting.  9) And Your Bird Can Sing - 3 - 3.5 stars - I almost like this more. Not quite there.  10) For No One - 4.5 - 5 stars - This song has aged really, really well. I hear a precursor to Sgt. Pepper's sophisticated lyrics, its melancholy and maturity. I like it more today.   11) Dr. Robert - 2-2.5 stars - Never really liked this song. Like Taxman, a personal gripe with little else to it. Nothing inspiring sonically or lyrically.  12) I Want To Tell You - 4 stars - It sticks with you. It shouldn't but there's something about the way they slide into their vocals.  13) Got to Get You Into My Life - 4 stars - Always liked it. Good, not great.  14) Tomorrow Never Knows - 4-4.5 stars - I did not like this song when it came out. Today, it's really interesting and, well, hip. Almost great.    All told, lots of good songs -- but because \\"Greatness\\" followed this album does not make this a GREAT album, despite being a critics' darling.
B000002UAX|5.0|I have loved the beatles most of my life.  I recently discovered my White album was missing both CD's!    I recevied the new CD in record time in excellent condition and it is just a fantastic ground breaking album.    Anybody over the age of 40 likely already knows how phenomenal the Beatles were and how they have shaped our music!
0060935464|5.0|I know that a generation of people have read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as an assignment in school.  I was not one of them.  Having enjoyed the movie several times, I was familiar with the plot, but I had seen lists of books that \\"you simply must read before you die\\" and this one was at or near the top everytime.  Therefore, at age 60, I set out to accomplish what a majority of people seem to have done at age 16.  I picked up a used copy and began reading.  Even though I knew exactly where the story was going, I could not put the book down until I had finished it.  The story is just that compelling and the author's style is that powerful.  The only other novel I have read that affected me this way was \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\".
B0029LHW4U|3.0|To begin with, this review is intended to be as objective and helpful as possible. A lot has been said since the release of this record several days ago, and generally the reviews are either exorbitantly rapturous, proclaiming this album to be \\"Dirt, pt. II\\", or hastily dismissive, accusing the record of falling short to live up to the standards set by previous works of Alice in Chains. In my opinion, this broad spectrum of incompatible critiques is provoked by confused expectations, regarding this new material. The main factor in causing confusion is, naturally, the name of the band on the disc.          Given the name, one would normally be inclined to compare \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" to previous works of the band. But as it turns out, this comparison doesn't do any justice to this new record. The album lacks powerful and heartfelt vocals, previously delivered by Mr. Staley, so those of you who expect to hear an emotionally driven, expressive vocal line with a wide range, prepare to be underwhelmed. The duties of the lead singer are now  being undertaken mostly by Jerry Cantrell, with William Du Vall on back up vocals which, as a matter of fact, should be the other way around. The singing sounds forced, uninspired, flat, and dreary. If it is of any consolation, despite everything noted above, the album contains a number of beautiful harmonies by Cantrell and Du Vall, which are reminiscent of the ones Cantrell used to create with Staley on a number of classic AIC tunes. With respect to album's lyrics it should be mentioned that the songs indisputably fall short of the sincere self exploration and glutted soul confession of \\"Dirt\\", or mesmerizing introspective poetry of the self- titled album. In some parts \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" almost leaves an impression of a desperate attempt to cover weaknesses of lyrics and vocals by the wall of distorted guitar sound.             Never the less, to give this work all the credit it deserves, it is important to use an appropriate point of comparison. As it should be evident from the discussion above, earlier works by Alice in Chains are not quite fair benchmarks for that purpose, but previous solo attempts by Jerry Cantrell might be. If we disregard the name of the band on the cover of \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\", we escape the unnecessary confusion of how to evaluate this record. In this respect it is fair to say that the new record is definitely the best out of three. It retains the raw power of \\"Degradation Trip\\", and melodic approach of \\"Boggy Depot\\". Mix it with contributions by Kinney, Inez, and Du Vall and you've got a solid rock album.         But let us call spade a spade. We have already been privileged to witness how Alice in Chains would sound with out Staley on \\"Boggy Depot\\". We were also shown the direction, which Cantrell would be able take the band, on \\"Degradation Trip\\". Alice In Chains in their current incarnation did not reinvent themselves  like they should have, instead Cantrell & Co. chose the easy approach and took a step back. The result of this tepid attempt was quite predictable: it turned out to be not a new Alice in Chains record, but another Jerry Cantrell record. It's just it takes long years of listening to their previous records to recognize it, and guts to admit it.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love this show and was so excited for season 3, thankfully I was not disappointed! Jimmy Smitts' character is amazing and adds a whole new level to what we know about Dexter.<br />In a nutshell, if you like the show, you will love season 3, it may be the best season yet! If you've never seen the show, you need to either buy seasons 1-3 immediately OR call your cable provider and get Showtime - all seasons of Dexter are now on On Demand for Showtime because season 4 has just started.<br />A funny, disturbing, insightful show about a sociopathic serial killer/blood splatter expert for the police who, at times, is more human than the other \\"normal\\" people on the show.
B00246VKGG|5.0|I'm teaching The Boy in the Striped Pajamas to my lower level students this year. I absolutely loved the fable and thought it would be a great way to teach the students the literary term theme. I purchased this film to cover my state's media standards. I'm so glad that a classroom edition was available. It has bonus material that will be great to show the kids to discuss propaganda (also a state standard). I'm usually a die-hard believer in \\"the book is better,\\" however, this film adaptation is incredible. I know it will spark a great discussion on the differences between print versus non-print. I'm excited to begin this unit with my students. I highly recommend using the film in your classroom. Plus, there are great teaching sources on the film available on the Internet (like a discussion guide).
B000GDEZCU|5.0|Where this might not be the greatest TMNT film or program ever made, for any die hard TMNT fan like myself it's a must have. And I was so glad to find it for A.) a great price and B.) in excellent condition! It's a concert I remember watching over and over from my childhood and after losing it years ago I thought all hope was lost of ever finding it on Tape again, as well as ever seeing it. Watching it when it was delivered brought back so many memories and I was amazed I still knew the words to the songs haha!
B002HNA95E|4.0|This is a good collection, but it could have been way better if a little more imagination was put in the mix. C'mon now, this is a Madonna celebration, there's no way you can sum her up in 2 CDs. For starters, there should have been 3 CDs. Period. The first CD could have collected her hits from her first four albums from her blazing self titled debut album to \\"Like A Prayer\\". The second CD could have started off with the absolutely fantastic Vogue (From her 1990 album \\"I'm Breathless\\"), wrapped around \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\" along with her ballads. It's a crime not to have included the song \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\". The second CD could also get a good load from \\"Ray of Light\\". The 3rd CD could have collected all her hits from \\"American Life\\" to \\"Hard Candy\\". It could have been perfect. Compilations are like that, there's always something which gets left out. This one is surely one of them. However, the Cover Art is very good coming after the absolutely terrible cover of \\"Hard Candy\\".     Definite Misses:  True Blue, This Used To Be My Playground, Love Don't Live Here Anymore, You'll See, Love Tried To Welcome Me, Don't Stop, Love Song (with Prince), Human Nature.    Verdict: Good (sigh!).
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This is a great CD. I love Nickelback and this CD only made me love them more. From the moment I put it in the car and \\"Something In Your Mouth\\" started, I was hooked. The CD is full of songs about sex. My fav song is S.E.X. I just love the beat and the chorus.
B00009RDG8|3.0|Friedkin and Jones have done notable work multiple times. One assumes this was made for the money to be made although it would appear that it failed at the box office. Nevertheless, for those who know that the logic for the action may be quite flawed but like to see chases and hand-to-hand combat, this should be a satisfying film. Obviously, those with no such taste will miss nothing by giving this a pass. Jones has nothing much to do beyond the action but looks good doing it; the actor playing the hunted does a commendable job doing what the hunted are supposed to do in films of this sort-not much acting but looking good in the closeups. Other assorted actors do all that was required of them without any embarrassing themselves. All-in-all, no significance besides action for the sake of action. Incidentally, relevant to this and many other films, both theatrical and made for TV: I do think it indecent to use scenes of real horror in the context of rather trivial even if entertaining pursuits. The justifiably respected principals of the film, no doubt agree, so that the presence of such scenes here probably means they drastically overestimated the quality of the film that they made.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|As Disney's first feature length film Snow White stands out as a timeless classic. The story is about how jealousy and vanity can consume and destroy a person to the point where they would kill those who stand in their way. The moral however is about how outer beauty cannot hide inner ugliness and that the most beautiful person is one who is beauty on the inside as well as outside. Here you go world, Disney's first princess movie.      As I suggested earlier this movie is about beauty and jealousy. Snow White is a princess and she has a hatred-filled stepmother. Her stepmother has run out of tolerance for Snow White because she has surpassed her as the fairest of them all and must be killed. The huntsman she hires to do the job can't bring himself to do it and tells Snow White to run away, which she does. She runs away and finds the house that belongs to the Seven Dwarfs, Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and Dopey. Snow White, along with her furry animal friends, cleans their tiny house in the hopes that they will let her stay, which of course they do. Now seven men living in one house and who work in a mine don't have much time to cook and clean, what else can you expect from seven bachelors? So, Snow White doing all the house work helps out immensely. So Snow White hides out there for a while. The Queen in the meantime finds out that Snow White is still alive and plans to kill her herself, but first she has to disguise herself and make a poison apple that contains the Sleeping Death poison. The Queen disguised shows up at the cottage (yet another example of why you shouldn't take anything from strangers) and Snow White takes a bite of the apple and isn't really dead, but looks dead. The only way to get her to wake is love's first kiss. She already has a love so all that was needed was for Prince Charming to find her. He finds her and kisses her and she miraculously wakes up.....and they all lived happily ever after.    This was the original \\"happily ever after\\" story. This movie set the bar for all fairytales and princess movies to come. This should be the first Disney movie any child watches because it is the first. Now while this movie doesn't cut it much for me anymore it was greatest thing on earth when I was five. I still love the dwarfs especially Grumpy and Dopey. I liked Grumpy because I could relate to him and I love Dopey because he's goofy and made me laugh. I love the early animation style they used. There's just something about it, maybe it's just comforting because I grew up with it. I like how there's a main point and there's no deviation, it's very to the point, but I find that's actually very little to the story itself; it's just very short. In the end all you can say is that it is the epitome of the Disney classic fairytale.    The Blu-Ray comes couple with a DVD version of the film in this Diamond Edition release. The audio is a crystal clear 7.1 surround channel mix that almost feels like you're hearing the picture as it was during the recording phase. There's also Disney View that integrates with BD Live to provide a full-impact look at Disney's first animated feature. You get music videos, featurettes and dedicated looks back at what went into making the film. Plus, you get a sneak peek at The Princess and the Frog.    What matters most of all is the picture quality. This transfer looks like someone opened the Disney vaults and gave you a copy of the original print. There is no digital noise, artifacts, compression issues or dirt on the print. Hell, I can't think of a recent release that offers you a film that perfect. The DVD copy included with the film packs most of the EPK and Disney Channel friendly content that's to be expected. What's going to keep this Blu-Ray disc spinning in your home theater is the Wow factor. That first Wow you get from the opening credits through the final frame of the film. This release is a revelation and it's one of the most recommended buys of the Fall.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I don't belittle the film by saying it is nice. It is a nice, a good, nice, film as few can make better than the talented Tom Hanks, Now, I am not saying that Tom Hanks is personally a nice guy, I don't know him. I am saying that as John Wayne, with a big assist from John Ford, created John Wayne who played John Wayne roles superbly, so Tom Hanks has created Tom Hanks, the character who can play a variety of nice guys in diverse situations.The film has been described in detail so I am left with, happily, simply the task of voicing my opinion that one comes away from the film knowing that a star has, with the help of Helen Hunt with not much to do but doing that very well, wrought his spell once more and left me, at any rate, with a good feeling as I got up out of my chair to take the DVD out of the machine and put it into its case to contribute to our resident's library with the assurance that other old timers will get the same pleasure out of it as I did.
1401323820|5.0|I think it is sooo! cool (sorry about the the ancient word COOL) that the promoters thought to actually publish the book Castle writes during the first season.  The marketing idea is great.  The writing so so.  But I love it because Ricky is sooo! cute (or is he ruggedly handsome?).  Anyway, to come to the point, Ricky needs a much better proofreader and I would like to volunteer.  Thanks for the fun!!!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|The Beatles for the 21st Century, 25 Sep 2009   By  Steven Green  - See all my reviews        Music lovers in general (& Beatles audiophiles in particular) are always searching for perfection but rarely find it. That they have not in this case does not diminish the achievement of these remasters.     Let's get a few things straight. These stereo remasters are not the following: The second coming, the Beatles in 5.1 DTS surround sound or the Beatles remixed.     What they ARE is the Beatles remastered for the first time from the original Stereo & mono master tapes.     I was born in 1950 and grew up with the group. (In fact, I don't think I could have survived my teenage years without the Beatles & music in general-it was the only thing that kept me sane). I bought the original 45's. L.P's (mono & stereo) & played & played them until they were engrained on the hard drive of my mind. So I can say without hesitation that these remasters are (for the most part) a revelation. The tracks sound the clearest, cleanest & most detailed I have ever heard. They also have more depth & clarity (particularly the vocals) than any previous issue. I have noticed so many things previously buried in the mixes that I almost feel like I am hearing the greatest band in the world for the first time.     I love what I hear (with a few exceptions) & find the more I listen the more that is revealed.  Even the first two LPS have some previously hidden details highlighted.    I am a huge stereo fan and feel it gives a more natural sound balance when done properly.  However even I agree that \\"PPM\\" & \\"WTB\\" sound better in their mono versions.  These two LPS are the only ones that should have been given a gentle remix (centering the vocals where possible & removing the excessive echo) which makes these a bit hard to listen to on headphones. I guess these mixes show the limitations of the basic two track recording techniques used at the time.     I have done all my listening using only my ears, aSony Walkman CD player & Sennheiser headphones. I have not analysed these discs on a computer, measuring the peak levels, compression, decompression, expansion & the like.       I know there will be some people on certain forums (SHss we mustn't mention any names) who will find fault with this project & their view is also valid. However to me  these remasters are so far ahead of the previous CD issues that there is no contest. I found the '87 discs a very difficult listen & put them away after a couple of spins never to be played again.    Working my way through the catalogue \\"AHDN\\" onwards shows the dramatic improvement the use of 4 tracks brought to the recording process. All the 4 track songs sound terrific with a depth & clarity not heard before.     When the group switched to 8 tracks on the \\"White Album\\" the improvements are even more noticeable with marvellous detail & bloom to the songs.    There is hardly any tape hiss (except on \\"AR\\") where it is noticeable but not distracting.      It should be noted that although the set is promoted as \\"The Beatles in Stereo\\" there a 7 mono tracks included.  These are: \\"LMD\\" (both versions), \\"P.S.ILY\\" \\"SLY\\" \\"IGY\\" \\"OANS\\" & You know my name (look up the number).  I have heard many stories concerning the master tapes for \\"SLY & IGY-either they were wiped, misfiled or stolen-all I can say is I'm not giving up my copy of the stereo tapes!!    The mono tracks sound very good indeed-with SLY sounding the best it's even been.     I could go on & on singling out individual tracks for praise (or mild criticism) but I will end by saying that this project has achieved what it set out to do, present the Beatles songs remastered in the best quality they have ever sounded. Thanks to all @ EMI for their efforts & let's hope that in the future we will be treated to the \\"Beatles Remixed\\" in whatever format is current at the time.         Highly recommended to all fans & new converts.  Hopefully (wife permitting) I will get a chance to buythe mono box set & will let you know my views on that one as well.    My final comment relates to those who complain that the Beatles should ONLY be heard in mono as that was how they were originally recorded.  This of course is not correct as ALL the groups Parlophone material was recorded on Stereo equipment & mixed to mono as there was no FM radio in the 60's.   All last we get a chance to hear them in both formats so fans have the best of both worlds.       May the music of The Beatles live forever
0385504225|2.0|I have to say I am a tentative fan of Dan Brown.  I really enjoyed Angels and Demons, and the Da Vinci Code was pretty good.  I have to say that this book was beating the Da Vinci Code until the last 50 pages.  The ultimate resolution, or twist just seemed like a cop-out to me.  Like he was trying to think of something really clever and then gave up and explained it simply.  Up until then, it is suspenseful.  The code breaking is fun and was I even able to figure small pieces out.      One thing I thought was interesting about the book was how it dealt with freemasonry.  I, like many thought this book was probably going to be Anti-Mason, but I was completely wrong.  If anything I would say that the book had only positive things to say about the Freemasons.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Freemason and I have to say he hit a few things in the craft right on and other things seemed to be a bit exaggerated, at least that is not the way we do things in my lodge.  For obvious reasons I am not going to specify.  But I will say That I do not think most Freemasons will have any qualms with what Brown put in the book.      One final comment.  It seems that in some ways this book was written to be turned into a screen play.  The chapter breaks and shifting perspectives seem made for dramatic music and sudden cuts to black.  I also think there is an overuse of flash backs which sometimes seem like tangents and pull you out of the suspenseful story you are supposed to be reading.
0385504225|3.0|Behind the myriad of writing flaws in this book, there is a brilliant story.     THE BRILLIANCE    I read Dan Brown for his fictional but poetic interpretation of real symbolism from our everyday world, along with the tantalizing morsels of revelation I get along the journey toward the final unveiling. I thought the basic plot and the immersion into freemasonry and its symbols in our nations capital were breathtaking. I thought the story behind the climax and denouement was spectacular. I just had to struggle to enjoy it because the words kept getting in the way.    THE BLEMISHES    1. Tell, don't show. Most of the book is telling. I'm told what the characters are doing and thinking. \\"Catherine lay bleeding.\\" Don't tell me Catherine is bleeding. SHOW ME.  In addition, often in the book I feel as if a narrator is interrupting the action and emotion to read hundreds of pages from a masonic encyclopedia. In the end, this book reads more like a late night history channel documentary with occasional amateur vignettes inserted for attempted drama. You could aptly re-title this book, \\"The Telling.\\"    2. Cliche overload. Much of the dialogue is top-of-the-head writing. Characters use the same responses repeatedly.     3. The story rarely offers momentum. I was led to believe the entire story takes place in less than 12 hours. In reality, most of the story is either a knowledge dump or extended back story. I wanted to feel as if I were on a 12-hour roller-coaster. I didn't feel much at all.     4. Characters are flat and disconnected. The formula for each Robert Langdon novel seems to be, \\"Have a girl by his side to solve ancient mysteries, but have zero chemistry between them.\\" Other characters are cliche, uninteresting, and provide no real tension in the relationships between each other or Langdon and Catherine. No matter how brilliant the story itself, characters must be interesting and drive the emotion. That simply doesn't happen here.    5. Fluff. Much of the book could have been cut to actually increase the story's value and momentum. I find it hard to believe the editor of such a long-awaited novel allowed so much deadweight between the covers.    THE VERDICT    If you don't mind reading past the text to get to the brilliant and poetic story behind it, I highly recommend this book. If you want emotional involvement and great character development, this book is not for you.
B000PAAJYW|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A great film that introduces and develops a half-dozen connected storylines in a thoroughly unique manner before introducing a plot element that has polarized viewers but completely fits in the context of the film, Magnolia is a modern masterpiece by PT Anderson which will stay with you long after much tamer and shorter (it is long, though very fast-moving) films are gone; don't be put off by the nay-sayers--see this stunning film.    4/4
0385504225|4.0|It isn't surprising to find that many reviewers did not feel that the book \\"lived up to expectations,\\" as this was an almost-inevitable conclusion coming off what turned out to be one of the top-selling novels in history.  I did not personally feel this to be the case as I thought that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", while good, was not even Dan Brown's best work, that being \\"Angels and Demons,\\" in my opinion the best novel I have read to date by any author.    Comparing this work with his previous 4 books, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is probably most similar to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (though it shares similarities with all of Brown's books).  Many general parallels exist:  1) 1 primary male and 1 primary female protagonist; 2) the search for a lost artifact (or artifacts) related to some ancient mystery and w/ religious implications; 3) a villain with what turns out to be a shocking \\"true identity\\", etc.  In a way it was a parallel version of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" with a different secret being unveiled and with a setting of Washington D.C. rather than France & England.  I also agree with other viewers that have noted the similarities of this book to the \\"National Treasure\\" movies, particuarly the first one.     Overall I think the \\"Lost Symbol\\" proved to be a solid novel even if it was doomed to disappoint many readers with the impossible-to-meet expectations that were sure to characterize the follow-up to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  There were certainly some surprises that made it a very intriguing read.  Now, it is true that the book was slow-paced at times.  For example, I felt that about the second 100 pages of the book (i.e. 100 - 200, or thereabouts) could have been trimmed of superfluous material and there'd have only been perhaps 25 pages left over.  Also, unlike \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I felt that the book \\"fizzled out\\" at the end without leaving the reader with any truly exciting \\"discoveries.\\"      On the other hand, this book did fortunately seem to lack many of the egregious historicalerrors of the ilk that tainted \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  There was a general appeal to Christianity's \\"link with the ancient mysteries\\" mentioned, a statement that would perhaps have found some scholarly support about a century ago but would not find much in that regard from today's New Testament scholars.  Of course, not knowing much about the history of the Freemasons personally, someone more in the know in this particular regard may find my statement regarding fewer historical inaccuracies to be incorrect.    In conclusion, with ridiculously-high expectations left in check, I think the typical Dan Brown fan should enjoy reading \\"The Lost Symbol\\" and I would recommend it.
B001C08RHA|2.0|The Bottom Line:    The positive word-of-mouth about Iron Man all talked about what a \\"new\\" look at the superhero movie this was, so imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch this draggy and utterly formulaic \\"origin story\\" directed tediously and with little flair by Jon Favreau; with typical comic book types like the fetching assistant Pepper Potts (a bored Gwyneth Paltrow) and evil Iron Monger (scenery-chewing Jeff Bridges), an utterly boring plotline and some troubling inconsistencies (notice how just before Tony Stark has his epiphany about the evils of violence he takes the time to torch as many Arabs as he can) Iron Man is a surprisingly and depressingly bad film.    2/4
B000FBGBPC|5.0|In June 2006, rockers Three Days Grace released their fantastic and strongest CD yet with their sophomore album, One-X.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever been in a horrible relationship, (especially one that has just recently ended), can relate to the lyrics in these songs.  Angry?  Frustrated?  Depressed?  Feeling hopeless?  Just got dumped?  Just dumped someone else?  There's a song on here for every downing emotion, letting you know that you're not alone in your misery.<br /><br />If you're not a big Three Days Grace fan and you want to be, this is a great album to start out with.  Their self-titled debut CD was decent enough, with such hits as \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"I Hate Everything About You\\", which put them on the map, but the real meat of their career is on One-X.<br /><br />Below is a brief description of each track on the album, with a numerical rating.<br /><br />Track 1: It's All Over--(7)--TDG come out with guns blazing on the first track.  Frontman Adam Gontier spreads his gritty voice over the darkened lyrics of this song, in which the subject is ruining their life with drugs and alcohol and Gontier can only sit back and watch them destroy themselves.<br /><br />Track 2: Pain--(10)--an excellent angsty song when you need one.  Dole out the pain, because hurting is better than not feeling anything at all when you become so numb and jaded.<br /><br />Track 3: Animal I Have Become--(9)--chances are, you've probably seen the music video for this song where Gontier turns into a freakish looking creature while the band rocks out behind him.  This song is a metaphor for becoming something you truly don't want to become, but have no control over it taking over you anyway.<br /><br />Track 4: Never Too Late--(9)-- a hopeful song that it's not too late to turn everything around, even when you think it is.  When you're in the deepest, darkest pit of despair and you can only think about ending it all, you need to realize that it's not too late--it never is, as long as you're breathing.  You can still fix what went wrong if you just try.<br /><br />Track 5: On My Own--(9)--a truly sad part ballad/part rocker about regretting when things went wrong in a former relationship and wishing you could just walk it off, forget it, but you can't--you just regret too much.  However, despite that, you'll stand up and try to move on, live life on your own now.  There's no saving the relationship now, so like it or not, it's time to move on without her.<br /><br />Track 6: Riot--(8)--a great song for when you're seething angry over something.  Somebody made you feel angry, used up, ripped off, stepped on and you're going to fight back.  To hell with them all!  Riot against them!<br /><br />Track 7: Get Out Alive--(7)--don't depend on others to keep you going.  If you want to get out alive, you're going to have to hold on for your life.  Do it for yourself and depend only on yourself 'cause others will only let you down.<br /><br />Track 8: Let It Die--(10)--a relationship gone wrong, she says he didn't try, but he didn't mean to let it die--he just fell out of love with her.  He tried as hard as he could while he could, but the motivation left him.  It was good in the beginning, but the beginning doesn't last forever.<br /><br />Track 9: Over and Over--(8)--he tries as best he can to pull himself away from her.  He knows this situation isn't good for him, yet he keeps falling for her over and over again.  He's tried to live without her, but when he succeeds, he feels dead inside.  He needs her to survive.<br /><br />Track 10: Time of Dying--(8)--he's dying right now without her but he will survive until she can be by his side again. He'll wait for her because he only feels alive when she's beside him.<br /><br />Track 11: Gone Forever--(10)--absolutely fantastic rock ballad about break-up denial.  He'll go out, he'll drink, get in some fights, be completely miserable, but he'll tell himself that he's better off and happier without her in a failed attempt to fool himself.<br /><br />Track 12: One-X--(5)--the only weak track on the entire CD.  A song about how everything we've been through connects us all, life or death situations, depression, everything.  You think no one has ever felt the way you do and so does everyone else, which makes us all One(-X).<br /><br />Overall album rating: 8.5everything we've been through connects us all, life or death situations, depression, everything.  You think no one has ever felt the way you do and so does everyone else, which makes us all One(-X).    Overall album rating: 8.5
B001AVCFK6|5.0|First off, I have never seen a Star trek movie in my life before nor have I seen any of the TV series. I'm a little bit familiar with the characters simply because being Star Trek the huge phenomenon that has always been, something has to rub on you.<br /><br />Now, as a complete outsider to Star Trek, I found this movie fascinating. J.J. Abrahams is a genius. The movie was simply perfect film-making. Just perfect. It's the small details that make a movie. And Abrahams nailed every single one of them.<br /><br />POSSIBLE CAMEO SPOILER ...................<br /><br />I think Leonard Nemoy's appearance and performance were incredible. I was also very impressed with Zachary Quinto as Spock. (he plays Sylar in heroes). His role was definitely one of the most difficult. He had to portray a guy who can not show emotion but he still had to get his message across in every scene. Difficult. But he pulled it off.<br /><br />I'm definitely adding this movie to my blu-ray collection.
B00006469V|5.0|If others have already spoken of this recording as the best-sung on the market but think of Solti as lacking the ultimate iota of spirituality, let me raise a dissenting voice over the latter point.<br /><br />It's most obvious that this is an outstanding achievement on the part of ALL the performers as well as the recording-engineers.  [The only singer I'm not truly totally satisfied with is Zoltan K&eacute;l&eacute;men as Klingsor, who seems at times to be anticipating some of Sch&ouml;nberg's \\"Sprechstimme\\".  Kollo actually strikes this writer as an ideal embodiment of the uneducated yet puzzled savage who is slowly turned into a really compassionate, Christian man by life's experiences as well as what Gurnemanz and - paradoxically - Kundry bestow upon him, as proven in Act III when he at long last finally makes his way back to Monsalvat and remembers both of them so well!]  To boot, there's no question that Solti is already relaxing in this work the way he later manifests in his (outstanding) recording of the Brahms Symphonies.  It's not as driven as the earlier recordings of Tristan (quite underrated in many ways, though it's a pity he didn't get another chance to prove what he in the last 25 years of his life could do with it the way he did with the Brahms!), the Ring and Strau&szlig;'s Elektra;  however, the broadness of vision (already noticeable from the very opening notes of the \\"Communion/Eucharist\\" motif starting the opera) is lovely to behold.<br /><br />[At this point, much as the singers have been properly judged by others, just let me please single out for particular praise Gottlob Frick's portrayal of Gurnemanz (who really becomes a flesh-&-blood 3-dimensional man here!) - what a contrast of a character vs. his equally-magisterial depiction of the black villain Hagen in Solti's \\"G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung\\".  Also oustanding is Fischer-Dieskau's convincing singing of the desperate Amfortas as well as Christa Ludwig's moving Kundry - on top of Hans Hotter's suitably-sepulchral Titurel.  Finally, but most importantly, the Wiener Philharmoniker is simply superb (as always under Solti - his precision counters any temptation on their side towards sloppiness)!!!]<br /><br />Of course, this music is not meant or written to be driven all that much, given its visionariness both spiritually and musically!  With the spiritual component (notably the choral writing in addition to the sympathetic treatment of the subject matter - interesting given Wagner's appallingly dreadful character and supposed non-relgiousness...), one realises that in this work the composer is contributing not only to opera but also oratorio (Kundry's temptations of Parsifal combined with her suffering not only notwithstanding but actually heightening matters!).  Musically, one sees both the seeds of Debussy's opera \\"Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande\\" as well as Sch&ouml;nberg's journey (together with his disciples Berg and Webern) into atonalism:  from \\"Parsifal\\" one can already see the path clear to the pre-atonal Sch&ouml;nberg works \\"Gurrelieder\\" as well as \\"Pell&eacute;as und M&eacute;lisande\\" (a symphonic poem to end all symphonic poems - it beats all of what Richard Strau&szlig; did hands-down!!).  Consequently, Solti's being more relaxed is not only VITAL to the success of this recording;  it pays off dividends in unveiling Wagner's final thoughts on religion and specifically Christianity (apparently in his last years, he had considerable interaction with a Lutheran pastor which seems to have changed at least a little bit of his thinking) given his death around age 70 which followed less than a year after this work's premi&egrave;re.  [He had wanted to write one or more Lisztian-style symphonies after this opera, but his departure from this world stopped any such plans from being carried out.]<br /><br />[Speaking of Wagner's frequently-vile thoughts:  thank goodness that at least all the racist, philosophical and other things he and so many others could/can see in this piece hardly need be noticed - in fact, it's not incompatible with a genuinely Christian viewpoint.  As to his cruel dealings with the conductor Hermann Levi on the basis of the latter's being a practising Jew:  EVIL and inexcusable as they indeed were, at least they were on a religious instead of a racial basis;  and when that happens, it's easier to move to eventual abandonment of such prejudices compared to when one can't have his (her) heart moved by the realisation of somebody else being a human being regardless of ethnic or racial origin!!!  {At least, it's easier to change one's religion than one's physical constitution...}]<br /><br />Regardless of what other teams have achieved (and here I'm being mindful of both Karajan and Knappertsbusch {who served as Solti's mentor during the Magyar/Hungarian's days at the Munich Opera} as formidable competitors whom I'll be glad to sample!), this recording of Wagner's final masterpiece most certainly is not 2nd-best recording to anybody else out there!

B0017I1FO4|1.0|Shinedown is a great group and I really love this album, BUT I'm giving the so called \\"enhanced CD\\" an F-.  It plays in a home or car stereo CD player just fine, but put it in a CD-ROM drive and you can't play the music.  You only get access to one directory with 2 files that automatically launch a window asking you to sign up for their mailing list.  (Signing up for their mailing list doesn't prevent the same stupid window from appearing each time you load the CD.)  The music files are hidden so completely that the only program I found capable of identifying them is EZ CD-creator, a program from the late 90's that doesn't even run on Windows XP or Vista.  Long story short, if you buy this CD and intend to listen to it on your computer (as I did), if you don't have EZ-CD Creator or another such program capable of reaching into the bowels of this disk where the actual music is apparently stored, you won't find %#%@ but 2 useless files and a link to their mailing list.  LAME LAME LAME, the producers of this album ought to be publicaly executed for trying to pass off a booby-trapped, broken shill of this product as an actual enhanced CD.  [Criminal suggestion deleted] this album instead, or at least D/L the mp3s.  For #$%@ sake, DO NOT buy this PIECE OF @#$%!

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was absolutely ecstatic to receive a preview copy of the Blu-ray edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  This is one of those films whose importance in the history of the movies is simply impossible to over emphasize.  While Disney had been one of the most important animators of the thirties, but by no means the only one.  The Fleischers were doing a string of utterly delightful short films as good or better than what was happening at Disney, not merely with Betty Boop and Popeye but a number of superb cartoon fantasies.  What separated Walt Disney from his fellow animators was producing a feature length animated film.  As has been recounted in a number of works on SNOW WHITE, many thought this was an incredibly Quixote film to make.  Most felt that it was going to be a failure, that most people would not be willing to sit through a long color.  Some of the reasons strike us as silly, e.g. that the bright colors would hurt the viewers eyes after a while and they would leave to rest their eyes.  (This may sound silly, but remember that in the years that this was being made, from around 1933 through 1937, most studios had only one or two color cameras - e.g., when Orson Welles was making CITIZEN KANE, RKO offered him one of their few color cameras, but he turned it down, preferring to do the film, but the offer showed how important the film was to RKO.)<br /><br />Luckily, SNOW WHITE was a huge hit (unlike the next few Disney feature length films, which turned a profit, but only a minor one).  And it is easy to see shy.  The film is a technical marvel.  Although it has been superseded by all of the films that have come after it.  What is astonishing is how close to perfect the film is in every aspect.<br /><br />The film looks absolutely spectacular on Blu-ray.  The colors have never looked better, but the real improvement is in the sound, which is crisper and fuller than ever before.  It has been reedited for compatibility with surround sound.  I've always loved SNOW WHITE, but I don't know that I've ever been as delighted watching it.  I'd seen it a couple of times in theaters as well as on VHS, but those prints were usually somewhat worn.  (Several fellow students and I went and saw this at a college film society; one of the students was the daughter of a major member of the Disney studios, a man who wrote screenplays for several of the major studios, designed some of Disney's major characters, and directed several films.)  The print here is not only perfect, a high def TV with a Blu-player and surround sound makes possible a viewing experience never before possible.<br /><br />SNOW WHITE features one of my favorite sequences in any Disney film.  The Huntsman has been ordered to kill Snow White and to that end he approaches her in the woods.  At the last second he is unable to carry his task out.  Instead, he warns her that her life is in danger and that she must flee to save her life.  So she runs immediately into the forest, where her terror turns everything she sees into a threat.  Logs in a pond appear to her as alligators.  Tree limbs are the arms of monsters who are trying to snag her.  Tree trunks appear to be ghouls.  Finally, in exhaustion she collapses in a small clearing, where menacing eyes look out upon her.  As she calms down the eyes are revealed to belong to bunnies.  And deer.  And chipmunks.  Quail.  Sparrows.  Bluebirds.  It is a wonderful sequence, as Snow White's imagination transforms the world into a savage and menacing place.<br /><br />One interesting feature of the disc is the so-called Disney View option in watching the movie.  You can either watch it in the original 4:3 ratio with black on each side or you can use the Disney View option, in which animator Toby Bluth (brother of Don Bluth) provides frames on each side of the image.  I was a bit dubious about this before trying it, but I have to confess that I like it a great deal.  I like that this is entirely optional.  I liked the resultsquite a bit, but I could understand if someone else did not.  The effect is very much like in older theaters where large curtains were opened just far enough to reveal the screen.  If you don't like it (my daughter and I both loved it), just opt for the 4:3 version.<br /><br />This Diamond edition does contain three discs.  The first is a DVD copy of the film.  The second is a Blu-ray copy.  The third is a Blu-ray bonus disc with both extras produced exclusively for this Diamond Edition and features that were produced for the previous DVD version of the film.  There are so many extras that it is difficult to list them all.  There are a great number that are intended for small kids and I'm going to pass on these.  I have close to no interest in those so I'll focus on the ones that I find especially interesting.  One especially interesting feature deals with what was intended as a sequel to the feature film, a short that was worked on but not completed, a project entitled SNOW WHITE RETURNS, in which the Seven Dwarves make a new large bed for Snow White.  I loved the feature on Hyperion Studios, where you got to go on something of a virtual tour of the site where SNOW WHITE was produced.  You see period photos of the various parts of the studio with interview clips from some of the people who worked there.<br /><br />Given the excellence of the film, the double versions, the large number of special features, and the historical importance of the film, this Blu-ray/DVD set is very nearly a perfect release.  Some Disney films (like the recently released PETE'S DRAGON) I can only recommend for small children.  But this is a film just about everyone should own.  If you have small children, you need it for them.  If you are a student of the history of film, you need it for the important role it played in the development of the medium.  And if you are a fan of great animation, you need it because this is the film that gave birth to the animated feature film.  And on top of this it comes at a really decent price.  This disc definitely falls into the \\"Must Own\\" category.<br /><br />By the way, not only did the film through its huge success make possible all future feature length animated films (though it is fascinating that other studios didn't immediately attempt to emulate Disney - both MGM and Warner Brothers had great animated departments that combined with the resources of the main studio might have been capable of making a feature length film), it inspired one live action film.  Howard Hawks directed BALL OF FIRE, based on a Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett screenplay.  In that film seven stuffy scholars engaged in writing an encyclopedia and living together in a Manhattan mansion provide temporary sanctuary to a gangster's moll on the run (played wonderfully by Barbara Stanwyck).  The film has also entered our consciousness in ways that make possible other narratives.  For instance, Snow White's singing to birds has been parodied in a variety of films, most memorably in SHREK (where Princess Fiona's warbling causes a bird to explode) and in Disney's own brilliant live action film ENCHANTED.

0142501123|5.0|My kids love the Halloween story, Room on The Broom. It is their favorite (ages 3 and 7).  It is about a friendly witch that has a knack for losing things. Still she always finds what she has lost with a help from a friend. In return for finding what she has lost, the witch always lets the finder hop on for a ride on her broom. From a parents prospective, I love how this book teaches that acts of kindness only do you good. Towards the end of the story the witches broom breaks and she finds herself facing off with a Dragon. Luckily with the help of her friends she is saved from the Dragon. The witch then does a spell that makes a new broom... Her old broom was a junker and this broom is a Limo of Brooms.<br /><br />From an educators point of view... this book is awesome: it has lots of rhyming and lots of repetition. It is a great story for retelling too.  If you are a teacher be sure to google: \\"Room on the Broom Lessons\\" and \\"Room on the Broom Coloring\\" and \\"Room on the Broom Teaching Heart\\" for lessons and coloring sheets to match this story.<br /><br />If you are a teacher or a parent you have room on your bookshelf for Room on the Broom!  It is a must read for October.  Great for ages 3 to 9.

I'm excited by her uncompromising style, interested (clinically speaking), scared of/by her, turned on and a little worried about my feelings for her. Great fun.

So i'd say these are over priced and would have just bought the X31 for $100 less. But they are tight and you do hear everything in the game. But i'm sure all models will do the same from my experience. So in all i'd save $100 and buy the X31's instead of these X41's.

In this day of HDMI connections, it seems surprising that one of the first products Amazon would sell in the AmazonBasics line would be component cables, but I'm not complaining.  Since HDMI comes bundled with copy protection technology, for now I'd rather use component connections. These cables are well constructed, convenient to use and extremely well priced; another winner in the AmazonBasics line.

My claim to Star Trek is that I saw the animated series during Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid, saw all of The Original Series (ST: TOS) and most of the Next Gen movies, TOS re-runs and all of the Next Generation (ST: TNG) episodes along with the first 2 or 3 seasons of Voyager and Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />While ST: TNG was (and still is) an excellent addition to the Star Trek universe, what was the last straw with Star Trek was finding out about Paramount and, possibly, Ric Berman's alleged decision to steal J. Michael Straszynski's idea for Babylon 5 and use it for the Deep Space Nine (ST: DS9) series. However, despite this controversy, I think both DS9 and Babylon 5 are great despite the stark similarities between the two.<br /><br />I was (and in many ways) still am disappointed with Ric Berman and company's decision to occasionally use time travel too. In my view, a story line becomes marginalized if the ability to go back in time and correct mistakes made in the present, past or even attempt to alter the future. Also, the science of the series under Berman's watch at times seems more like science fantasy than fiction.<br /><br />I have to give credit where credit is due. When Rick Berman took the helm of the Star Trek franchise, his team helped it grow up. Star Trek is one of the few T.V. shows that (like fine wine) got better with age. For example, Next Generation went from being a campy, b-movie oriented show in its first season to a sophisticated show with excellent story lines and development of the show's characters such as Picard, Data and Worf.<br /><br />As to this movie, I saw it last night and think it is the best of the Next Generation films. In this film, Captain Picard finds out he is a father (sort of) and has to act to stop not only the instagation of an intergalactic war, but also to check his clone's miserable upbringing while resisting Shinzon's demand that Picard submit to a blood transfusion so Shinzon can live. This film is definitely true to Star Trek's philosophy since with Picard's clone and Data's prototype you see the underlying humanist belief that self-improvement can correct the behavior of anyone. Including those who commit evil deeds or lack knowledge.<br /><br />The action, acting and special effects are great! I was glad to see Will Riker not only get a promotion but also marry Deanna Troi. However, I was disappointed with what happened to Data. Yet it looks like he can make a comeback but in a different way. We see the result of Picard's development with his excellent, skillful command abilities as well as his perceptive take on his adversary. We also see Data's full development come to fruition by being a father figure to his prototype and, in the tradition of Spock, his heroic decision to save the Captain and crew of the Enterprise.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this movie did not do as well as it did at the box office and is jeered many by Trekkies or Trekkers as being the single movie that contributed to the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise's demise. My favorite Star Trek movies are III & VI. Yet I give \\"Nemesis\\" high marks not just because of it staying true to what \\"Star Trek\\" is about, but also for what it does not have.
031604461X|5.0|I have limited my discussion of Breaking Dawn but there are some spoilers if you have not read the book.     Breaking Dawn is the culmination of the Twilight series and as such tells a big story.  Each of the prior volumes - Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse - provide the foundation for the final installment.  I found that Breaking Dawn has some of Stephanie Meyer's best writing.  Bella's engagement and wedding are written with great charm and joy, perfectly conveying the happiness of the characters. As honeymoon begins on the Cullen's private island, there is an undercurrent of doubt as to how well marriage between a human and vampire will work out. If it will work out at all.     Ms. Meyers moves the story along logically with the newlyweds going away to a private island. Questions as to how well or long a marriage between a human and vampire is abruptly interrupted by Bella's pregnancy.  The story of the pregnancy is told by Jacob in his own book.  At first, I was a little annoyed at the change of person.  The change in perspective to the wolves seemed to get in the way of the story.  However, I soon enjoyed Jacob's narrative of Bella's pregnancy although I did skim through the portions dealing with Jacob's break from the pack and becoming an Alpha.  The fear of what the child inside of Bella might become and that it is literally slowly killing her adds tension to Jacob's story and turns this part of Breaking Dawn into a true page turner.       When the final book began again with Bella as a vampire I enjoyed returning to her perspective. The sensory descriptions of Bella were particularly well written and I enjoyed the joy of discovery.  The half-human half-vampire child Renesmee makes her appearance as a phenomenally gifted member of the Cullen family. An added surprise was that Jacob imprints on her. The new daily life of Bella was quite fascinating for me and I thought these chapters were well written.  But, of course, what the Volterii will make of Renesmee isan open question and one that is answered when they show up in strength.     I found the chapters dealing with the preparations to face the Volterii of interest as each coven of vampires (and several nomads) appear.  They are nicely drawn as individuals with their own gifts and doubts.  Overall, this is an impressive achievement and a book that one finds compulsive reading.  The book has an open ending so, perhaps, we might have a volume or two that explores life with the mature Renesmee.
B000FJGWBM|3.0|I purchased 2 years ago, about the same time I bought my PS3. Movie is great so I decided to watch again recently and no movie doesn't run. No scratches, same PS3, 2nd time taken out of box. Perhaps this is a Lionsgate issue cause same thing happened with American Psycho.

1433502410|5.0|My New Study Bible ESV has been very helpful.  Easy to understand and it will become more valuable to me even more as time goes on and I keep researching all of the helps it has.  It helped before I purchased bible to be able to find out exactly what I was getting.
0385504225|1.0|He must have been paid by the word, I thought it would never end. As you slog thru the verbage the Ancient Knowledge has to include time travel. Similar to Deception Point and maybe the worst of the 5 he has written. The timeline of the action is so out of whack the rest of the plot devices lose any credibility and serious contemplation. As bad as D.P and Digital Fortress are the beating to death of the Ancient Knowledge in this book is far worse. No new ideas, if you have read his previous work this one won't have any surprizes.
B000066744|5.0|This film leaves me truly speechless. Beautiful filming, profound writing and an interesting story. What more could a man want? Even a big explosion for the teenie boppers.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I really love Smallville, I didn't know what it would be like without Michael Rosenbaum, he's my favourite, even though I missed him not being in the series I can tell you that every episode in this eighth series was really really good. In the past the writers have certainly missed and made some awful episodes - especially those stupid witch ones with Lana, but everyone was surprisingly good in this season and I watched the entire season within a couple of days. I wish in the ninth season they would introduce Bruce Wayne, as he is part of the future Justice League. In Australia we are so far behind the times so now I have to wait a whole year to watch the next season. You will not be disappointed with season eight, I thought it was fantastic, it looks a great show to work on as well with some behind the scenes stories. Well worth every cent, wished they made more than 22 episodes per year, the storyline could continue for a very long time and with the stars now grown up, it could be called \\"Metropolis\\" instead of \\"Smallville\\".
B000F8O2PG|5.0|All the Stargate series of movies are very good.  DVD's were in great shape.  Price was very reasonable.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|...but the terrible production quality of the final source on the CD won't let me actually hear what is going on. Before I continue my rant, let me just point out two things: 1. I loved AIC in the 90s but I am not automatic, knee-jerk fanboy who drools at whatever they release. The three-legged dog album, for example, was just OK to me, and still stood in the shadow of \\"Dirt,\\" \\"Jar of Flies,\\" \\"Facelift,\\" and even \\"Sap\\" to some extent. 2. You need to know my angle on production quality. I'm an audiophile with about $1,000 worth of stereo equipment. I know when a redbook CD is mastered by a talented audio engineer, and when one is not. This album has some good material on it musically, but requires MAJOR tweaking of one's equipment to get there.    First of all, a CD can only take so much volume before you begin to hear crackling sounds, which this CD does in places. This is called Dynamic Range Compression. On this CD, the bass drum is so intrusive that it \\"pulls\\" sound away from the other instruments each time it is kicked. Related to this, the bass guitar on this album is just too bassy and quite often drowns out the vocals and/or rhythm/lead guitar tracks. This might be desirable for the hard rock fan who enjoys a muddy, chocolatey sound, but to those of us who want to hear the music as it was played in the studio as closely as possible, and in the proper balance, this is frustrating. I tried this CD with my Grado headphones (great for metal), and there was some improvement, as the core driver in Grado headphones doesn't allow for a slow decay of bass thumps - it recoils rather quickly to account for double-bass drumming - they have more of a sharp \\"thud\\" than they do a rap-style \\"boom\\" to them. The CD didn't sound too good with my Sennheisers or my Audio Technicas either, again, because the bass guitar and bass drum got in the way of what the guitar and vocals were doing. Just to reiterate, this might be the desired sound for some of the younger kids, but for me,I'd like to hear all the instruments without any overlap or dynamic range compression. If any sound engineers are reading this review, please, please stop destroying the music for those of us that have nicer equipment - our equipment picks up your sloppiness. Granted, the album actually sounds somewhat decent through crappy earbud headphones, but the sound is also excruciatingly flat when played through that medium (regardless of how popular cheap earbuds are). Moreover, I have a volume knob (several, actually) and I know how to use it, so please don't turn up the volume for me when you lay down the source material onto the CD. If I want your songs louder, I'll adjust the volume myself, thank you very much.    Content-wise, I liked \\"Your Decision\\" the most so far. It sounds like something taken from \\"Jar of Flies\\" laced with electric/clean channel guitars throughout. Again, there are places where the bass guitar drowns out the clean channel guitar, which is sad, but some of this can be abated by adjusting your equilizer (but not all of it). Most of the other songs really do seem to pick up where \\"Dirt\\" left off, which was and still is my favorite AIC album. The grunge groove and feel is present almost everywhere, and I'll be darned if Stayley's ghost isn't present here as well. I always admired the way Cantrell and Stayley could harmonize (they sound so close - reminds me of David Gilmour and Richard Wright), and Duvall and Cantrell pull this off, to my surprise. Cantrell takes lead vocals on a couple of tracks, and if you ever heard his song \\"Leave Me Alone\\" which was played during the closing credits of the movie \\"The Cable Guy,\\" you'll know what I mean when I say that Cantrell can handle his own vocally.    Production quality aside, I give the album 4 stars, but I'm knocking a star off of that because of the poor engineering.
0385504225|2.0|This book was a let down after Dan Brown's other books. I wouldn't recommend you buy it, but borrower it from a sucker like me that bought it.
1881273156|5.0|I wish I'd read this book sooner.  Not all men (or women) want or need the same things.  This book does a great job showing you just how those differences can manifest themselves, how they can be healthy, and that what matters isn't so much about how we're all different, but rather how we understand and even appreciate those differences so as to be able to show love to the person in the way they need to hear/receive it.  Nicely done.
6305736650|3.0|I watched this show with expectancy having heard about it all my life.  The sound quality is clear but inaudible.  Had to listen keenly to hear what they were saying.  I enjoyed it and am now in love with Humphrey myself.  Don't know that I would watch it again but I certainly appreciate the fundations set by this movie which is indeed a classic.

B0026JWDQW|3.0|First off, Amazon needs to add some depth to their ratings system. There seems to be a vast chasm between 3 and 4 stars, similar to the difference between a 60% D and a 80% B. If it were up to me I would give this album 3.5 stars or roughly a 70% C. This album is not a failure by any measure, as a matter of fact I liked this album overall.    What an unexpected treasure. After digesting his freshman effort \\"These Streets\\" over the last several months \\"Sunny Side Up\\" came as quite a surprise. On the first album he shied away from his native heritage vocally while honing his focus on a great story telling dynamic. He discussed his insecurities surrounding women, relationships gone wrong and his abiding faith in the opposite sex. Not to mention his passionate desire to love and be loved. Not to say his voice was anything to turn your nose up at, quite the contrary. The carefully crafted lyricism mixed with catchy folk hooks makes this album both enchanting and irresistible. I loved that album and will continue to listen to it for years to come.     The first thing that strikes me about \\"Sunny Side Up\\" is the return to his roots as a Scotsman in his vocal intonation. You can tell within a just a few moments where he cut his teeth. This is a good album, with some great individual songs. what it is missing however is a sense of cohesiveness. There are several amazing songs but they fail to execute on a consistent narrative. While he continues his theme of passion for women, the over all message is delivered using a different approach, tragically it comes across delivering mixed signals. In terms of an epic album this doesn't quite fall into the amazing category, however I would definitely recommend you give this album a spin. \\"Candy\\" sticks out to me as an extremely bright spot on this, his sophomore effort, however I think that \\"These Streets\\" is a more cohesive effort album for your money.
B002HNA95E|4.0|I'm a huge Madonna nerd, so of course I was interested in picking up 'Celebration' to hear the remasters and to find out which versions of songs would be used. For the most part, I'm happy with everything. Improved sound quality on the earlier songs is exciting, especially when you're bumpin' \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" in the car. But I agree that this set could have included a third disc, because Madonna has so many diverse gems to offer new fans. So I took it upon myself to make an iMix that can serve as that third disc. Check it out:    [...]  Hopefully, a few people will download this, burn it, and add it to the first two CDs. It contains vital tracks that I thought should've been included. Here they be:    1 American Life  2 Human Nature  3 Deeper and Deeper  4 Jump  5 Hanky Panky  6 True Blue  7 You Must Love Me  8 You'll See  9 Rain  10 I'll Remember  11 This Used to Be My Playground  12 Oh Father  13 Keep It Together  14 Causing a Commotion  15 Nothing Really Matters  16 Bedtime Story  17 It's So Cool (bonus track from iTunes deluxe release of Celebration album)    Hope you guys enjoy. I'd love to hear what you think should have been included. Maybe one day we'll get that complete set of remastered single versions...
0385504225|5.0|If you are a curious person, a science junkie or just knowledgably of Washington D.C. you'll love this book. If you are a Dan Brown fan then you'll really enjoy this book. If you are not a reader in general then you'll probably.... maybe dislike it.
0345472322|4.0|I first heard Dr.Dweck on a teleseminar about helping people lose weight.  Since this is what I do for a living, I found it quite interesting and bought her book.  The book elaborated on her mindset theory, which she was easily able to communicate in a short period of time during the conference:<br /><br />There are two mindsets, she has found in her studies.  People with a fixed mindset who just believe \\"that's the way it is/it's supposed to be and nothing I do is likely to change it\\" and people with a growth mindset who think \\"I can do something different to make this better\\".<br /><br />During the seminar she related these mindsets to weight loss, and in the book she goes into how it applies to learning, parenting, talents such as writing, drawing and music, and in relationships.<br /><br />I think it is extremely applicable in my field.  We already know how important frame of mind is in weight loss success.  This just clarifies more precisely where people are coming from and how they can adjust their thinking o improve their success at getting the weight off.  And it helps me, as a weight loss coach, to see how I can direct my line of questioning to steer my clients towards a more positive outlook.<br /><br />This book would be helpful for anyone who wants to improve an aspect of their own life, or those whose job entails helping others improve.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|First time I heard this disc, by the time I got to \\"Private Hell\\" I was crying.<br /><br />I haven't stopped listening to it for the last week and a half.  I put it on repeat, and each time it plays the sound gets stronger.  Oh my.<br /><br />Favorites are probably \\"Your Decision\\" and \\"Last of My Kind\\" but there are ONLY GREAT SONGS BEGINNING TO END.<br /><br />Layne is present on this disc.  The sound could perhaps be described as Power Grunge.  It is grunge, but minus the self-destructive bend that characterized a lot of nineties music.  There is power in this disc . . . an inner strength that defies death itself.<br /><br />This is the best rock album of 2009.
0316010669|5.0|An incredibly enlightening book that makes you understand your thoughts and hunches in a new light. Definately a must read
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonamassa has been scaling new heights since he was a youngster. I've been fortunate enough to witness the last 5 years and, as good as Joe has been, this is the pinnacle of his career so far. Selection of songs, sound quality and videography are all outstanding. There are many special moments in this DVD, but most people will point to the moment when Eric Clapton walked out on stage and joined Joe in a rousing audition of \\"Further on Up the Road\\".  No disrespect to Mr. Clapton, but I have never seen a guitarist as talented as Joe Bonamassa and I sensed a passing of torch while they shared the stage.
0385504225|1.0|It's unfair that Amazon's 5-star review system doesn't allow one to rate a book with no stars.  Because this book deserves no stars.    Not only is this the worst book of the year, but of all time.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is not a critic's darling like In Absentia or Stupid Dream were, but it is my favorite album from this extraordinary band. I am not one to hand out 5-star ratings like popcorn either (check my other reviews) but this one deserves it. This album further puts an edge on the already heavier sound of In Absentia without sacrificing PT's melodicism, creativity, and downright artsy mojo. The album opens with the Led Zeppelin homage, dark, powerhouse title track and grabs your attention to never let go. Every song is a winner and different from every other song on the record. Still, the album retains a cohesiveness that flows like the best of them.     This album was intended as a concept album that would later be developed into a movie, but band leader Stephen Wilson has not been able to get that project off the ground. The concept has to do with a ghost of someone dear to the subject of the album. This makes the general darkness of the album warranted. This edition also includes a terrific remix of the song Shesmovedon from Lightbulb Sun that is superior to the original by miles.     Fans of hard rock and art rock alike will find much to like here. Don't expect to find the next Metallica or a mosh-pit mentality in this music. It isn't there. Instead look for engaging, catchy, melodic rock with enough riffs to get your blood pumping and enough depth to keep the thinking man interested. If that's your cup of tea, you've come to the right place. Porcupine Tree is a welcome breath of fresh air in the current faceless music scene that spawns nothing but clone bands that sell attitude instead of talent. This is one band to watch rise. The sound of the recording is impeccable and the band have won awards for their 5.1 mixes of their past albums. Highlights: The Whole Thing      Highly Recommended
B00001ODGR|5.0|This is the definitive Styx lineup that you need to watch in order to experience the real Styx in Concert.  Even though it is past their late 70's heyday, these guys still rock it pretty good.  Some get annoyed by DeYoung's songs, and some think  Tommy Shaw gets annoying too, but you have to face it, the two of them leading the band IS STYX, and they both lead this great concert.  A must have for any Styx fan.  CThe video could use some rematering, but they do have the audio in DD 5.1 which is nice.
0061703257|5.0|Otherwise you won't experience this book as you were meant to, that is, without knowing the story.<br /><br />In fact all I can say about the book is that you have to read VERY CAREFULLY. Try to carve out a few days where you can devote time to some serious reading.<br /><br />I read the last few chapters while waiting for the Ambien to kick in. I wasn't sure how the book ended, and had to reread it to make sure. A careful rereading though cleared it up.<br /><br />Great book!<br /><br />Evan
B001TODCII|4.0|I'm not going to mince words.  \\"Taken\\" is trash cinema in the best sense.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the film's premise was pitched.  Ex-CIA operative trying to rescue his comely teenage daughter in Paris after she's kidnapped by an Albabian white slavery ring.  Probably the honchoes listening to the spiel were sold at mid-sentence.  What makes the film palatable is the prescence of Liam Neeson.  Neeson does his \\"Schindler's List\\" best to elevate this project above it's pulp roots.  Neeson and the film's makers keep you in their grip from start to finish.  After it's over though you realize that what you've seen is preposterous.  Don't tax your brain cells too hard and enjoy the thrill ride.
B00004RF9B|5.0|How could any SciFi fan not love this iconic classic. I have read where the remake of this film is coming out in 2010. I can't wait! I just pray the producers do it justice.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I think this is an excellent new CD from one of the greatest singers we have in the music industry! Her voice is not that angel voice anymore that she had in her twenties, but she sounds mature and beautiful on this album! Her songs are telling a story from what she´s been through in her life, and she delivers them with style and grace! You can listen to this terrific album from beginning to end. Every song is beautiful, and you will not want to skip any of the songs. My favorite is \\"A song for you\\", I look to you, Like I never Left. Thanks Whitney for this great album! Whitney girl! I have been on pins and needles waiting for this. I knew you would be back & it was worth the wait.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|The Amazon branded HDMI cable is great!  It's cloth wrapped and very sturdy.  I was not expecting such a high quality cable.  The quality is on par with the Monster brand cables, but without the monster price.<br /><br />I believe this cable will last a long time and it definitely beats the flimsy generic cables that are readily available.  The image quality using this cable was also nice, although to my untrained eyes, I couldn't see much of a difference between this and my older, cheaper cable.  On the other hand, I just like the feel of this cord over a regular plastic cable and I recommend it for anyone looking for a high quality HDMI cable.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|The movie came in great condition, and arrived earlier than it said it would.  I would recommend them any time!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|at first u thought this going to be a straight forward horror thriller movie like The Omen or the likes.<br /><br />But of course that is not the case. I was surprise how good the twist was.<br /><br />Only time will tell whether this movie going to be classic. But before that I would say that this is a one good movie.
B00004S367|5.0|I have held this recording in the highest regard ever since it came out in 197x.  A few months ago, I loaded this on my alarm clock, and my wife and I have been waking up to it and listening to it daily since then.  Every single day we say...\\" What a fantastic recording.\\" i.e,. After 100's of recent listenings, Music of my Mind  seems even more complex and beautiful than what I envisioned way back when.  The songwriting, performances, and arrangements are all top-notch...raw, exciting, musical, and sincere. Simply: great, timeless music. If I could rate it 6-stars, I would.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|So Amazon has gotten into the cable making business, this is a good thing.  These cables are well built, and as others have written they are double shielded, and use nitrogen injected foamed polyethylene dielectric.  What does that mean?  No static on your TV.  The end are gold plated, which means no corrosion on nasty buildup on the plugs themselves.  The outer covering is a heavy duty and still very flexible, allowing you to bend the cables through tight spot and around tight corners.<br /><br />More then anything else these are affordable.  Cables of this quality will cost you three times as much at an Audio Visual store, or even a big box like Best Buy or even WalMart.  These perform perfectly, and are at a great price point, so if you need these cables there is no reason not to buy these ones.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|From the moment this flick started I knew I was in the right place, for me it was zombie comedy heaven all wrapped up in a nice new package. We've seen zombies presented in all sorts of ways before but generally we get them in the same old unimaginative way; people get trapped in a house or other edifice and try to fight them off. Yeah. I saw that back in the 1960s and I've been ready for something else for a long time now so I appreaciate any new twist to the formula no matter how slight. The twist here is that ZOMBIELAND is character driven. If it weren't for its 2 main characters, Columbus and Tallahasse, this flick wouldn't be half as interesting as it is. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is an agoraphobic kid who has managed to survive the zombie apocalypse because he has never trusted anyone and by strict adherence to a set of rules he's devised. Tallahassee is just a mean son of gun who would survive ANY apocalypse. The other twist (and what might be irking zombie fans who don't want a story with their carnage) is  that ZOMBIELAND is a horror comedy wrapped around a coming of age film. But don't let that put you off in spite of what you might read elsewhere because ZOMBIELAND has more blood and guts and zombie kills during the credits than most films have in their first hour plus it has a finale of nearly unequaled slaughter, numerical speaking. It also has the most bombastic hero ever to level a shotgun at the walking (or sprinting) dead in the form of Tallahassee, Woody Harrelson in a role that would revive anybody's sagging career. Does it have flaws? Sure it does. For one thing it could have given us more Harrelson but maybe in the end it's better to leave your audience wanting more than to wear out your welcome.    It may not be as clever as FIDO,as consistent as SHAUN OF THE DEAD, or as outrageous as DEAD-ALIVE but this is a pretty darned good flick with some serious laughs, some funny kills, and a zombie slaughtering hero par excellence and you really oughtto see it in the theater.    Highly recommended: 4.5 STARS.
B002BSHXJA|1.0|Sorry, making the mono mixes available only as a set is unfair.  Let's face it, some if not most prefer some albums in mono, some in stereo.  So you have to buy ALL in order to get the ones you want in mono?  EMI has squeezed a lot of money out of Beatles fans over the decades, and stands to make a lot of money once again.  Couldn't they have helped us out a little bit and made these available separately?  Show us a little consideration.    Yeesh.
B00006HBUA|4.0|The classic cartoon finally gets a live-action film! Everybody was perfect as each character. Two years after Mystery Inc. split up, they are all called back to duty when Emile Mondavarious, the owner of an amusement park called Spooky Island needs their help to solve a mystery. Somebody is taking the souls of the visitors and replacing them with monsters. I highly recommend SCOOBY-DOO!!!
0385504225|2.0|Pretty hokey and anticlimactic. But, if you follow Noetic sciences and are interested in Masonic history you will find the majority of this book interesting from that perspective. Dan Brown really had the opportunity to turn this into a real Indiana Jones adventure but fell so flat.  A disappointment since I wanted the thrills of the adventure. I wish it had ended with something earth shattering hidden in the corner stone!
0446402397|5.0|I was drawn to Child 44 for two reasons.  First I was intrigued by disturbing Soviet/Lithuanian scenes in \\"Hannibal Rising\\" and the recent 20/20 tv segment \\"From Russia With Love: Russian Adoptions\\" pertaining to disturbed Russian adopted children, some violent, unable to bond, kids that hate to be held, chew glass or defecate on themselves, and a few murdered by their adoptive parents. And modern-day Russian orphanages adopting out children with Hep B, HIV, fetal alcohol syndrome, missing fingers and toes...    Second, the opening prologue entranced me. I can't recall ever reading such a compelling start to a book. And it seemed effortless, like it was just a natural opening to the tale. Yet I didn't buy the book that day. It haunted me for over six months until I made the purcase at Borders.    This is a very disturbing story. A story of a terrible way to live, a horror story in a way, aside from the serial murders, the fear and violence of these peoples' lives is terrifying and heartbreaking. Fear is everything. Things you think you know about characters change before your eyes. Every chapter brings an insightful revelation. Surprises small and large litter the tale and seem as natural as the sun in the sky as they unfold. It is one heck of a book. I eagerly look forward to reading Smith's next novel.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|She just doesn't have it anymore, and while other artists can still be mainstream, her attempt to fit into what's popular now is laughable.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I thought this had a really good love story, and had hilarious moments! Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey were perfect together. Lopez stars as Mary Fiore who is a wedding planner that doesn't have a love life, until she is saved from an accident by Dr. Steve Edison. Mary begins to fall in love with him, until she realizes that he is engaged to her biggest client. I highly recommend THE WEDDING PLANNER!!!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|What a disappointment, oh god! A movie like MIB (1) deserved a 1000 times better sequel than this turkey Mr. Sonnenfeld has delivered (or thrown?) to us. It started ok, nice chick, great body, funny scene. But as agent J comes to stage everything goes down the drain like the flush scene in the deneuralizer room. I mean, Will Smith was supposed to make us laugh as much as he did in the first one or even more (as everyone was expecting after seeing the trailer which shows the sole funny parts of the entire movie!). Instead his acting is so cheap. bi-dimensional. and ultimately bad that after the scene with the worm thing in the subway I could just predict that the whole movie wasn't going to get any better. I was sort of praying for Tommy Lee Jones to save the ranch, as he is a serious, more experienced and better actor than Smith. Instead, he was acting like shaving on a Monday morning! Spirit-less, like just making it for the paycheck and the pressure over him to pull out a sequel. Any of his lines in the movie are even close to funny whatsoever. And of course, let's skip Jonnhy Knoxville part! I'm just gonna say that he indeed proved what he is, a Jackass! I think that the only savable acting among this bunch of disasters is the dog which had the best lines and gave a sort of relief to the pain coused by the rest of the cast.  Besides this, the special effects are not even close to good, the only acceptable ones where Frank the dog and maybe the flying car, The rest of it....oh boy!! who did this???? same crew as MIB?? what happened to you guys?? had a glitch in the budget and had to change your Silicon Graphics for Comodores 64 to cover it??? I can't believe that in 2002 and with a similar budget to the first movie (made 5 years ago) you can pull off (not even accidentally) such bad special effects like for instance, the Ivy alien, the Worm alien, Jonnhy knowville second head and so many other cheap, close to B-movie SFX that would be only impressive if they hadbeen done 15 years ago! Specially that part when the pod thing mounts fly on the sky in the last part...GEEZ you could even see the residual blue border around the figure of the black girl inside the pod like in movies from the 80's! Unacceptable. period.  This movie sucks, from head to toes. It killed the first movie likewise The Lost World did with Jurassic Park (or even worse). You guys (crew) should put the MIB saga to sleep forever for good. This kind of trash is what I call 'let's forget about art and let's make it just for the money. Let's make it more childish, anyway, kids don't recognize a bad SFX from a good one'. What a shame.

B00004BZ16|1.0|I would say that out of Sandinista's 36 tracks, only 7 actually qualify as good:  The Magnificent Seven, Somebody Got Murdered, Up in Heaven, Police On My Back, The Call Up, Washington Bullets, and Charlie Don't Surf.  Something About England, One More Time, The Sound of Sinners, and Midnight Log are okay.  Perhaps with these 11 tracks, Sandanista would have been a more cohesive- but still not great- album.  Unfortunately, there are 25 other tracks, most of which are practically unlistenable.      I don't mind a band expanding its sound and going experimental, as long as they remember to keep themselves in check and don't over-indulge.  Remember, less is more.  I've read the stories behind the creation of this album, but in the end, it's the music that matters, and in this regard, Sandanista is simply awful.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I have to agree with the other reviews. The quality of the subtitles is poor. But listening to the actors spoken Swedish dialog, you can get a lot from it. Also the visuals and the entire mood and feel of the movie are phenomenal. It truly is one of the best vampire genre films I've seen in a long time.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This release was the best, I only ever had a scratched vinyl record and this CD just makes the listening experience so much better.    I will buy some of the other releases.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Amazing record...I can see why they chose Duvall for the lead vocalist if you hear his late band Comes with the Fall the song rockslide is the [...] .. hes got good range and deliverance...let it soak into your soul and it will take you for a journey into the dark and the light.
B00007E8O5|2.0|Degradation Trip is monstrous: 25 tracks, with many of them clocking in at over 5 minutes.  This is precisely what turns DT from an album into a two and a half hour endurance contest.  The songs, most of which are heavy, thunderous, and slow, all blur into one another.  After having this album for over two years now I still can't recall that many lyrics or riffs from the individual songs, as they all sound the same.  This is also what brought down Alice in Chains' 1995 self-titled album: overlong, indistinct songs.    That's not to say there aren't any good tracks on here.  Angel Eyes, Solitude, Chemical Tribe, and Anger Rising are all great tracks.  Psychotic Break, Mother's Spinning In Her Grave, Hellbound, She Was My Girl, Locked On, and Spiderbite are okay.  The thing is, all these songs are on the one-disc version of DT.  This two-disc version, however, adds two instrumental tracks, one of which is great (Hurts Don't It) and one of which is okay (Feel the Void), as well as Siddhartha and Give It a Name, which are okay rockers.      I wanted to like this album, but I couldn't get into it.  When almost every song has the same slow tempo and same guitar tone, and there are so many songs, it's not so much an album as it is a tossed-together collection of music (like The Clash's disastrous 36-track album Sandinista).  I would definitely recommend Cantrell's Boggy Depot over this.  If, however, you feel compelled to own this album, I'd recommend getting the one-disc version, as it has the worthwhile songs and much less filler.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I have to say that this is a solid effort by the \\"new\\" Alice In Chains. There will be no other albums like Facelift or Dirt because there is no Layne to do them, however, there are moments where I almost feel like I'm listening to the old Alice In Chains. \\"Check My Brain\\" is definitly the stand-out song here. I like the new guys voice. It's alot more polished than Laynes. There is no one to replace the grit and roughness that Layne gave us, but this is as close as you can get and maintain that AIC harmony. I like it. A little soft for me, but it's another dose of AIC and I am happy with it.
0307454541|4.0|My husband found this slow to get into but at the end he couldn't put it down until finished.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|The title of the review says it all. This is more mindless, trying too hard to appease the masses, exploding crap that Hollywood continues to pump out. Many people will suck it down, so there probably will be a sequel.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I'm not usually one for electronica, which is why I view Songs of Faith and Devotion as Depeche Mode's crowning achievement, followed by Violator.  'Sounds,' while it does not have very many organic elements, is at least a much more focused and streamlined album than Ultra, Exciter, and Playing the Angel.  Ultra and Exciter can best be described as having a few great tracks surrounded by filler.  Playing the Angel is better than those two, but is brought down by horrendous production and an overly loud master.    'Sounds,' thankfully, has much better production than the previous album.  The music is mixed properly and has a far more elegant sound.  While many songs on 'Playing' were grating due to the loud master, the songs of 'Sounds' have a smooth, almost leisurely quality.  In Chains, Wrong, Fragile Tension, In Sympathy, Miles Away, and Corrupt are all fantastic tracks.  Hole to Feed and Come Back are also decent.  There are a couple lousy tracks, but unlike Ultra and Exciter, the good outweighs the bad on 'Sounds.'
B001RNO7B2|5.0|I bought these as my motorcycle shoes.  They work great and are very comfortable.  They are really durable and don't scuff easily.  I find myself getting rid of shoes so often before their time because the leather gets beaten up too quickly.  No these though.  They are going to be around for a long time.
0312370849|3.0|This book starts with such pace that I could not put it down till I was about 60% through. The contrast between Sarah's voice and Julie's voice help ease the intensity of the story. Sarah's story overall is much more compelling than is Julie's and when Sarah's voice ends, the story struggles to keep up with the pace and expectations.   Events in the second half seem akward and not at all practicle ( flying to another country with child when a phone call would do...etc ). The relationship suggested at the end is also akward and almost strange.   It is a powerful piece of fiction that made me research on the internet about the event described and think and remember.
0061854549|3.0|It has been known for some time that people are not fully rational.  The real question isn't can we fix people.  I think that we can not.  Rather, the question is can we make machines which ARE rational.  My Asa H is such an attempt (R. Jones, Trans. Kansas Acad. of Sci. vol. 109, pg 159, 2006). Artificial intelligence can be thought of as the attempt to build the world's first rational mind.
0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol is by far the worst of the 3 Robert Langdon books.  The tragedies to the characters are resolved to easily (and to conveniently) and really, all in all, there's no real story here.  No suspense.  No drive.    The book reads as more of an \\"obligation\\" by Dan Brown to fulfill some need for himself and not for the reader, like a \\"hashing out\\" of random ideas on a variety of notepads.    There is far too much \\"on the nose\\" historical/factual lecture from the characters too, and they just all seem to \\"know it all\\".  I dare say Ben Gates is a better treasure hunter than Langdon in this book.  Like the movies from Brown's books, this one falls flat on it's face and it's too predicatible.  The ending is premature and then drawn out over the course of chapters with the characters \\"explaining\\" this and \\"explaining\\" that and whatever.    A yawner at best.  There are very few moments where you're really wondering what is going on...with interest...where the story tightens up and grabs the reader, but they're so few and far between they're soon forgotten.    To label this book a \\"thriller\\" would be a rather dry and boring assault on all real thrillers out there.    Can't say I'll be waiting for the next Langdon book.  The character is lifeless and one-dimensional and knows far too much to be human (like a walking encyclopeadia of everything).
0385504225|4.0|From the Book:    The Lost Symbol is a masterstroke of storytelling---a deadly race through the real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths...all under the watchful eye of Brown's most terrifying villain to date.  Set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, D.C., The Lost Symbol accelerates through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale. . . .    My Opinion:    I liked this third book starring Robert Langdon, although I know many people did not care for it.  I agree that Dan Brown set up this fiction to be ready for a movie contract down the road and it reads as though it is a movie stript and I could envision the camera shots with each chapter.  I found the story entertaining, exciting, at times hard to put down, and I learned a great deal from having read it.  Some of the mystery within the story I guessed at correctly early in the book, but the rest was unveiled at the end, as it should be.
1600243916|5.0|My Favorite Author and great book! I suggest to read the book first before listening to the audio book. It gave me a different perspective when listening to the Author.
B000002UAU|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles. I bought every  album that came out. Sgt. Pepper was a great album, but for all together different reasons. The songs on the album were musically a masterpiece due to the numerous instruments and sound effects that the band utilizes. It is more like a classical music album. The sound will blew you away, but if you were to name and rate your favorite Beatles songs, not many of these song would be rated at the top of my list. The beauty of sgt pepper is that it flows into the next song. The Beatles were the only group that had great talent and rarely produced a song that was not memorable or enjoyable. Sgt pepper is an album that appealed to young and old and broke through the generation gap. If you wanted to pick one definitive Beatle album and play it for someone who had never heard the Beatles, this is definetely not the one I would pick. The Beatles sound was not representative of the songs on this album. This was a phase. The songs are not as catchy as many of their previous albums. The music was intricate and jumps out at you through the speakers.

B00000DHRZ|5.0|A few years ago a Japanese friend of mine unexpectedly gave me this CD to listen to for a while. I'm not familiar with any other Offspring songs, so I expected this to be the usual angry troubled successful rich guys yelling into the microphone about whatever. About halfway through the second listen (OK, I wasn't paying much attention the first time) I realized these songs are pretty hilarious. I'm sure my Japanese friend had no inkling of the humor. I really grew to like the album overall, and later bought my own copy. Rather than some hate-filled rant, it seems to me this is a relatively thoughtful call to examine more closely some of the things that are seriously wrong with America.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I wanted to see this movie at first because of Sandra Bullock's charm in her romantic comedies.     I got caught up with the movie more than I thought because of the script, direction and, of course, the chemistry between the two lead actors, Ryan Reynolds being Sandra's love interest. The dialogue is smart, realistic, sweet and doesn't treat the comedy heavy handedly. You don't feel that the pace and story is too simple or drawn out. Betty White also deserves kudos as cute Grandma Annie who knows how to use age to her advantage.    This movie was just what I needed.  I think it is another of my romantic comedy keepers that I'll see once a year.
0307276902|1.0|A co-worker left this book out and I gave it a going over. I feel compelled to warn you about it and give a testimony.<br /><br />This book is steeped with the attitude of independence from God and all authority; in other words, pride. And pride is the oil that keeps the addicts wheel rolling unto death.<br /><br />This book is full of shameless vulgarity so rank as to make a sailor blush. This is a sign of a lack of humility and brokenness. This alone is a good reason to avoid it. In the book James was a joker, another word for this is scoffer. Pride is unbecoming of backward, finite creatures like us.<br /><br />It is also faithless and therefore void of any worth to those in need. Allow me to tell of God's goodness to me, how he saved me from death. I am not talking of blind faith, but faith rooted in history, and the power of a changed life.<br /><br />I have come to understand that we are all born God-hating rebels, to the core, in our father Adam. We use our lives to ignore and suppress the knowledge of God that is so glaring within and without us. We are rebel artists who use our lives to make God look bad, and who would rather go to hell than submit to God.<br /><br />That is why we need a new heart, and that is what is offered. It is not gotten by commitments, reforms, decisions, and all the junk that modern Christianity offers (nor is it offered by AA. Let us be clear: sobriety is not the same as salvation). It is given by Sovereign Grace to those who come in true complete need in prayer to God though Christ.<br /><br />God answered my prayer and saved me. He did this when I was not pretty. He gave me faith in His Word and love for His person. He saved me from me (among other things).<br /><br />Jesus Christ is risen from the dead. That makes him relevant to us all and worthy to be heard. He is also completely desirable and reliable to say the least. Jesus Christ is the God-man. God did not leave us alone, but united Himself to our kind, and is victorious over the Law that rightfully condemned us and took the punishment of the sin of those who trust Him. Christ was the substitute for those who trust Him. He took my sin to His account in Glory and to my account He put the credit of His perfect life. I am now free from guilt and therefore free to love God.<br /><br />I am now free from all condemnation and live in a world of love from God toward me. He saved me from the pit of my own ideas and destructive way of life. He delivered me from hell and put my feet upon a rock.<br /><br />The King James Bible is the finest book in the world. Give it a read. Look at Christ for yourself. Two key books in the New Testament are the book of John and the book of Romans.<br /><br />I hope the best for you all.over the Law that rightfully condemned us and took the punishment of the sin of those who trust Him.

B000T05R90|4.0|Pink Floyd's debut THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN really does seem to capture the Zeitgeist of its 1967 release date. As Pink Floyd recorded the album only after a fairly long apprenticeship in London's UFO Club, the album includes complex, sometimes jam-like tracks such as \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", the last one of the true synth rock efforts. On the other hand, PIPER features more straightforward pop tunes, whose psychadelic nature comes from Syd Barrett's bizarre lyrics which find delight in housecats (\\"Lucifer Sam\\"), gnomes, and bicycles. This mix of awe of the infinite and a childlike naivete will be familiar to anyone with completely spaced out acquaintances.<br /><br />Yet that dichotomy in the album, between vast soundscapes and inconsequential ditties, is its weakness. It's no surprise that the album has been overlooked compared to, say, SGT. PEPPER of the same year, which are slightly less psychadelic but possess a great consistency. But that complaint only holds when considering the album as a whole. Track by track, this is all excellent music, performed with a proficiency and legerdemain one wouldn't normally expect in musicians this young. I like to dip into PIPER fairly often.<br /><br />Various CD releases of this album exist. I'd encourage getting the mono version, as the application of stereo technology to the recording was primitive and it ultimately proves a distraction.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|In the mini-documentary that is included with the 2009 Remaster edition of \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" John Lennon says that this is one of his favorite albums because of how strange it is.  Strange, indeed.  It's an easy album to dismiss for some since it is definitely The Beatles at their most psychedelic stage, yet there are a lot of good songs here.  Bizarre and a tad odd at times?  Certainly, but that doesn't mean there aren't great gems included!<br /><br />\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is definitely nowhere near as poppy as their earlier works, but to me that just shows a band who was maturing and unafraid of experimenting.  They were always doing their best to make sure that every album was a completely different experience.  The album can become very upbeat and fast, and then can slow down.  Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" has an especially eerie feel to it that I can't explain.<br /><br />Even though I have just recently become a fan of The Beatles, I did hear some songs when I was younger that I enjoyed and was surprised to find a bunch of them on this album.  Favorites of mine include \\"The Fool on the Hill,\\" \\"Hello, Goodbye,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"All You Need is Love\\" and of course Lennon's odd classic, \\"I am the Walrus.\\"  That's a song I will never grow tired of, and \\"All You Need is Love\\" is the perfect ending (I especially enjoyed that brief callback to \\"She Loves You\\" at the very end).<br /><br />The 2009 Remaster sounds excellent to me, although I don't own a previous copy to compare.  What I can tell you is that the vocals, guitars, drums and bass sound very solid.  To get the full experience, make sure you listen to this on a good stereo.  Headphones are fine, but sometimes you miss out if that's the only way you listen to it.  The mini-documentary that's included is a fine feature, even if it is only a few minutes long.  It's interesting to hear the actual band reflect on the album and certain songs.<br /><br />\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is another fine addition to The Beatles catalogue.  It may not be as strong as \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Revolver,\\" but it's a great album to listen to that includes a number of excellent songs.  Be sure to crank it up even louder once \\"I am the Walrus\\" comes on!  Not a bad tune to be found on here, in my opinion. - Michael Cranes catalogue.

B00065GX64|5.0|This is a chilling film about a child murderer who terrifies a Berlin neighborhood.  The police seem to focus on the lowly criminals and prostitutes in the area and seem more interested in making a show of the hunt at least in the beginning.  The community members are terrified and numb at first then become activist in hunting for the killer.  Police eventually bring in skilled investigators who come close to catching the killer.  The people use a blind possible witness for better effect.  What happens to the killer, who captures him and his explanation form the essential thought provoking finale.  Capital punishment, evil deeds and uncontrollable compulsions are discussed and become part of the story.  The psychological background of the killer, the police and the community were ground breaking at the time.  The DVD comes with a story booklet, several interesting documentaries and quite a lot of information on Fritz Lang and German film-making at the time.  I found all very interesting.  Loved them.

B00004U28G|4.0|If you love classic comedies, \\"Cannonball Run\\" is a must own, especially for all of the celebrities that take part in it.  But, don't get the 2001 release which is only in DD 2.0 and that annoying clipper case.  A brand-new 2009 DVD was released recently with 5.1 audio, superior picture and a fantastic audio commentary with director Hal Needham and producer Albert Ruddy.  You learn so many fun facts about the film from it.  For example, Burt and Dom's ambulance was a real race vehicle used by Hal and Brock Yates for one of the five real Cannonball Run races before the film was made where they raced it from Darion, Kentucky to Long Beach, California.  It held 90 gallons of gasoline and they would get up to 145 MPH at times.  A lot of the situations and characters in the movie were based on real events and people from the races.  Burt, Dom, Jack Elam and Farrah's characters were all based on Hal and Brock, and a doctor and his wife that road with them during a race to make it seem like a legit ambulance if pulled over.  One of the best audio commentaries I've heard in awhile and very funny.  If you just want the commentary by itself, write me and I'll share it.  Don't miss this movie if you have never seen it.
B0025T65GC|5.0|Devin Townsend stepped out of the recording industry in 2007, opting to produce records for bands, rather than making his own, deeming the process \\"exhausting\\". Two years later, he's back with the first in a four-part series called The Devin Townsend Project. This first chapter is Ki.  The whole record is a journey, and it feels as though it is a patient man who at times feels as though it's going to lose its temper, but then calms down before it occurs. At times it is peaceful, as in A Monday, Coast, Terminal, Ain't Never Gonna Win and Winter. At other times, it starts to lose it as in Disruptr, Gato, and Tranfire. At one point, it completely gives in to anger, as in Heaven Send. In the final four tracks, everything seems to come together. Lady Helen seems to be the recognition of pain and the will to deal in the proverbial man's life, the final arpeggios of Ki (which arguably, at the time of this writing, are the culmination of Devin's sheer genius)representing the final moments of sadness, and ultimately happiness. Quiet Riot seems to represent the man's knowledge of pain but ultimately in Devin's own words, is \\"fine\\". Demon League then seems to represent the contemplation felt after this realization.  Giving a generous 5, I would ultimately have to give the album a 4.7 out of 5.  All in all, this is extremely different from anything Devin has ever released, and it is quite refreshing. Those who know of him simply from S.Y.L. or Ziltoid would do well to know that this is completely different from either of those albums, and should not be looked at as a failure by a metal god, but as a work of art by a musician of seemingly endless dimensions. Devin always seems to prove that the only limit that exists for him is infinity.

Was happy to find Dexter; but miss the unedited version and being I have a 45% hearing loss I also miss the closed captions.  Wish this will get rectified!  Otherwise, I love to thank Amazon and Showtime for allowing us fans to view these shows!

6305428042|5.0|I think I first saw this around 1994, forgot about it but stayed in the far recesses of my mind (mostly the sight of Kathy Najimy flying a vacuum) and then saw it again in the summer of 1998, causing it to now be one of my favorite movies. The teens/kids acting ability in this movie ranges from sub-par (Shaw and on-and-off again with Katz) to obnoxiously bad (Birch). The two \\"bullies\\" are your quintessential '90s bullies, complete with '90s lingo (tubular). So the main focus on why this is one of my favorites are the three leads; Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker (who hasn't aged well in my opinion) and Kathy Najimy. Midler (probably my favorite) plays Winifred as the more serious of the three but is pretty funny in her own right (most of her funny lines come from her interactions with her sisters) but she can pose a serious threat when needed. She's the one with the most power, being able to cast spells and fire lightning bolts from their fingertips (someone was watching Star Wars when they wrote this, though some person in cinema history might've fired lightning from their fingertips before the Emperor). And of course being the star of the picture, the Divine Miss M gets her own musical number, singing a reorchestrated \\"I Put A Spell On You\\". And she wears my favorite color, so no complaints. Parker's character Sarah is the idiot of the group. She's also the sexiest of the group and is positively crazy over any man she sees. Her power is a siren song to lure the children to the cottage. And what a song it is. \\"Come Little Children\\" is a beautiful song but can also feel menacing and haunting at the same time. Najimy is plump Mary, the most level-headed of the group and has an interesting taste in hairdos. Like Midler, she also has her funny moments (one of my favorites being after Winifred explains what they must do before the sun rises). Her power is being able to sniff out children, which comes across as weird. I mean its useful for what the witches' do, but its a shame she couldn't get a more interesting power. Overall, a satisfying movie, fit perfectly for Halloween. And if you'll notice the name of the director, its the same man who would destroy the musical genre with the dreaded High School Musical, this film probably being the only good nostalgic one he's ever done.a shame she couldn't get a more interesting power.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|i just love watching smallville  it took on a real direction change cant wait to see if there is more to come hears hoping
0385504225|2.0|With much anticipation, I dropped what I was reading to start the book.  It started well and kept going down after that.  The plot was very esoteric and gave me a headache trying to understand the physics of it all.  The characters reminded me too much of the Da Vinci Code.  It got worse as it got along.  He kept repeating himself as if to make sure the reader could understand.  What I could understand did not need to be repeated.  Towards the middle I was reading faster to get to the end and when I did it was a bummer. The ending of the Code was beautiful and haunting.  I don't understand his obsession with pyramids.    Living in DC area (Alexandria) I found his research into the area fun.  He did his homework about the sites in and around DC, enough to make me visit sites I passed everyday without noticing.  He certainly got Alexandria right.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing I found fun.    Wait for the paperback; or better still, take it out of the library if you mus.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I'm a 39 year-old guitarist, songwriter, and hobbyist recording engineer. I discovered Porcupine Tree in January of 2006 with \\"Up the Downstair\\" and became an instant fan (Pink Floyd has long been my favorite band). When I heard \\"Deadwing\\" I couldn't wait for the next disc to come out, and \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" blew me away (see my review here on Amazon). Sadly, I couldn't catch PT at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle 'cause family was in town, but I resolved to see my second favorite band on their next tour.    So, you can imagine, I was VERY impatient for \\"The Incident\\" to be released. Fortunately, Steven Wilson released a brilliant solo album that kept me busy until the \\"Time Flies\\" video was posted to the web. Huh? I was baffled, because it seemed like a personal sketch of Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\". Sad to say, I wasn't bowled over, but since it was out of context from the album I reserved judgement.    I managed to get tickets to the PT Seattle show at the Moore Theater and the next day I excitedly bought the album.    I will be the first to say Steven Wilson is a genius, and his bandmates are great musicians. But for me, \\"The Incident\\" does not measure up to their previous three albums. It pains me greatly to admit that for the most part this album doesn't move me. Not to take anything away from Steven and crew because this album WILL speak to a lot of people - and may reach some new fans. But except for a few instances, this album doesn't feel like the cohesive, focused, thematic, emotional work of art that most recent PT albums are.    The first disc doesn't sound like one song, but rather 14 songs that segue one into the next. Maybe I need to listen to it more, but even in concert I wasn't grabbed by my heart or my balls or my brain by \\"The Incident\\" like I was by other PT songs. Maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe FOABP was a high benchmark? Maybe Steven Wilson is FAR ahead of me, and I'll catch up? I don't know, but I got \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"Stupid Dream\\" at the same time as \\"The Incident\\" and I enjoy those albums more.    \\"The Incident\\" is a very good composition with some rewarding and amazing music on it. However, I can't help but feel that it sounds rushed and lacks the soul and heart of Porcupine Tree's last several studio outings. By comparison, the new Alice in Chains album gave me goosebumps and shivers down my spine, then moved me to tears on the last song.    I'm looking to the next Porcupine Tree album to not only move me, but also move Porcupine Tree forward to higher ground.
0805047905|5.0|I love this book, it is so fun to read and I love the illustrations. It includes different animals and each one is a different color. My son is 15 months old and loves this book. He saw it at the library one day and would not let go of it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is by far the HARDEST, but most awesome workout DVD I have ever tried. I could not even get through the first workout because I was not use to doing jumping jacks and working out without a break. If you can make it through the DVD without stopping you WILL feel the burn, and you will feel incredible when you are done. This DVD WORKS! I am happy to say I can now get through the workout without turning it off :)

B0029LHW4U|4.0|The signature sound of Alice In Chains is Jerry Cantrell's guitar, composing and, yes, voice. The band's former lead vocalist was a beloved, selfish junkie, more consumed by scoring smack than singing, so much so that the band toured and recorded much less than they could have. This new album, like all AIC records, has a few somewhat sketchy tracks, but overall it's the band's best, a sonic tapestry alive with phenomenal voicing, enveloping instrumental power and compelling arrangements... a beautifully heavy record yet buoyant and uplifting.
B000069HK2|5.0|definitely an awesome album.  i was such a huge used fan when this album came out and i used to buy every album they put out afterwards.  unfortunately they have lost their edge since the first album, each album after slowly going further into the abyss.  however this album is just spectacular.  before this and even after i never liked screaming, screamo, emo, whatever people use for the types of indie music effects that burt is actually able to pull off miraculously as an artist, due to both his incredible voice and overwhelming, violent, and sometimes putrid energy.  i don't see how everyone that likes music cannot own this album.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|When I looked for this movie for my granddaughter (which she loves) for her birthday, I couldn't find it in Cleveland, so I purchased it from Amazon.  Now I find it EVERYWHERE for less than Amazon ($5.00 - and no shipping charge).  I am disappointed in that.  Next time I won't be so prompt to jump on your site.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|I will start out by writing that I don't believe it was necessary for WB to include the censored version of Justify My Love in this collection.<br /><br />As for the other videos in the collection, I enjoyed the earlier videos more than the later ones. The older ones have more depth and substance to them, IMO.<br /><br />Many of the videos were filmed in NYC and show off the famous skyline. These videos brought back a lot of memories. They feature some great performances, too.<br /><br />Papa Don't Preach, is one of those videos that has great character development for a music video. Most of the earlier videos featured are more like short films than an average music video. Madonna seemed to work with the best directors at the time.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the American Life video included in the collection. Overall, the collection is good, yet the packaging feels limited and lacks a polished presentation.<br /><br />The DVD menu is dull, yet it serves its function. The viewer can choose to play all the videos or select a video to play. The audio is clear in both stereo and surround sound. The video quality varies.<br /><br />Most of the videos featured are entertaining. Some are thought provoking. A few would easily make any, \\"best videos ever made\\" list.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Fleet Foxes defy categorizing - four-part harmonies are rich, evoking a baroque, choral tapestry. The songs on this album lead a journey - a medieval trek through snowy fields, rushing rivers, hilltops and valleys. As background music, this works fine, but it is so different it will capture your attention and cause you to stop what you are doing.  The album has most impact if heard from beginning to end, without interruption. Give this three honest listens - you will be rewarded. GENRES: Baroque Folk, Mellow Rock, Choral.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: Simon and Garfunkel, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Bon Iver.   MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"Sun It Rises,\\" \\"Blue Ridge Mountains,\\" \\"White Winter Hymnal.\\"
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Each episode is well scripted, performed, directed---created! I became a fan this season and while I don't usually purchase tv shows I had to have the entire season to watch whenever and as often as I want. Season 4 is epic and the episodes can be watched often. Enjoy!
B000068FY1|5.0|The Jayhawks are pioneers of the Alt Country thing (I hate this genre name, but the cat is out of the bag). Ever since first hearing this album over 15 years ago, I viewed it as a nearly perfect. The recording is spot-on for the material - unpretentious, jangly, fuzzed guitars, a real piano - a perfect backdrop to well-written, tightly structured rock songs, with harmonies from Gary Louris and Mark Olson - they were meant to sing together. The Jayhawks pull their songs back to their roots, with hints of old electric Neil Young are in here (ala Zuma). Back-to-basics rock songs - a stellar album that has stood the test of time. Own it! GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Alt Country.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: James McMurtry, Whiskeytown.  MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"Two Angels,\\" \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" \\"Wichita,\\" \\"Martin's Song.\\"
B002L5GQGY|5.0|that your sister got all the looks...<br /><br />I watched the entire RAH DVD last night...I was almost speechless.  I know. Hard to believe.  interviews and all.  I'm not one to tell secrets, especially in print, or I'd never be let backstage or on the bus, again. I have a checquered past at best.<br /><br />Watching that DVD, I was there onstage with my friends, couldn't help it, transported by magic.  Every nuance of expression, every quick grin, every slick Rojas bass trick, every fake out by Bogie (when one thinks crash and all you get is \\"ting\\"), every time Joe closed his eyes and breathed power into every note, every Rick doubling of a guitar part and more, every horn swell in perfect time, the respect given to and received from the second drummer Fig, every unspoken communication between master artists at the top of their game, I felt more than saw, and I'm somewhat visual.<br /><br />I try not to be too critical, as a musician, because I am a musician, and I know how much WORK it is.  I was moved when Joe's Dad. Len said yeah he has God given talent, but his work ethic is why he is what he is, and why he's here.  I KNEW THAT.  I said that the first time I watched him play.  I have no critique...i love it.  I connected with the force of a BAND making music.  You will too.<br /><br />I call them my friends, my mates, my brothers.  I hope they know it.  Hope that doesn't sound like I'm bragging.<br /><br />I'm getting wound up...anyway, I saw the old stoic, Eric Clapton himself, smile a little when Joe pushed him just a bit, so he pushed back.  Sweet!  I heard blues variations on a theme.  Chorus, verse and bridge.  A lost art raised from the spiritual death of ignorance and commercialism.  Emotion both raw and processed.  Edited superbly.  I liked the stereo and the Dolby 5.1.<br /><br />My son came out of their bedroom and sat.  He looked at me and said, \\"Well that was kickass.\\" in his usual too cool for school way.  High praise.<br /><br />Blues Deluxe answered every blunatic purist in the world...take that, you unwashed heathens.  Happier Times, The Great Flood, TBOH, Joe dug deep and put it out there.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|Wilco's 6th studio release, Sky Blue Sky, is their most easily accessible album yet - song structures are complex and edgy, but recording is pure, warm and soulful. It also sees the debut of current guitarist Nels Cline, a refreshing and welcome addition to the band's sound. And he is good. Most songs are purely relaxed rock arrangements, but in true Wilco fashion, each is shaken apart at some point with some razor sharp edginess that takes the tune to a new creative realm that reminds me of why I love these guys. Wilco is brilliant. Jeff Tweedy is a masterful songwriter, and this is a truly enjoyable CD.   GENRES: Lite Alt, Rock, Mellow Rock.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: Ryan Adams, Neil Young, Son Volt.  MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"You Are My Face,\\" \\"Impossible Germany,\\" \\"Sky Blue Sky,\\" \\"Hate It Here.\\"
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I watched this a couple of weeks ago, and said to myself \\"wow...a great flick\\".  I'm glad to see it's now one of the best rated movies to rent on Amazon.  It deserves it.  If you're looking for avant garde genre-breaking plot, this isn't your ticket.  If you're looking for a classic mix of sci-fi/fantasy with great presentation and overall entertainment level of \\"10\\", this is the spot.
B00000373U|4.0|Either/Or is a fine example of Elliott Smith's unique songwriting, his \\"whisper\\" singing voice and multi-tracking harmonies drifting over complex, often schizophrenic chord progressions and song structures - indeed, his brain was wired differently. Then there is the darkness - Either/Or is a raw recording, an appropriate soundscape for the angst that appeared to plague him to the end. His psychological issues aside, Elliott Smith was a songwriter's songwriter - he was gifted artist, a tormented soul - perhaps the two go hand-in-hand, but sometimes the most beautiful things are not all fun and games. GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Contemporary Folk.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: The Beatles, Wilco, Nick Drake.  MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"Alameda,\\" \\"Between The Bars,\\" \\"Angeles,\\" \\"Say Yes.\\"
0634014331|5.0|Hammond Organ Complete is a great book. It requires some piano or keyboard skills, also reading scores. So it´s perfect for me, someone hwo has been learning piano for 3 years and now wants to learn the particularities of this instrument.    The cd includes empty tracks (rithm and bass) so you can play on them.    The writing is clear and the lessons well organized. It cover a wide range of knowledge, from basics to advanced use.    Highly recommendable.
B0029358GM|4.0|Wilco (The Album) is fairly accessible for non-hardcore devotees, but eclectic nonetheless. Wilco is never about straight-ahead songs - this CD offers pleasing, melodic tunes elbow-to-elbow with more experimental alternative tracks that harken to earlier, edgier releases.

0385504225|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!        Dan Brown must use a plot generator that goes something like this:    - Start with Robert Langdon, renowned symbologist who, despite being thrown into multiple international secrets, scandals and run-ins with assassins, is permanently perplexed (in an attempt at humility) as to why anyone wants his help with, you know, his life's passion.  - Add one secret society, ancient or otherwise, and the secret \\"only they hold\\".    - Place in an appropriate city which coincidentally has a high percentage of landmarks pertaining to this secret society.  - Add a member/someone aware of this secret society who is killed/maimed/kidnapped.  Helps if he knows or has met Langdon in the past (thereby preventing them from calling some other world renowned symbologist for help in the investigation).  - Add a mysterious, intelligent, single woman who has some relation to the aforementioned killed/maimed/kidnapped secret society member and who Langdon constantly uses as an intellectual crutch when he can't put the pieces together.  Obligitory romance may ensue.  - One dash of a high-ranking police/security official who will be under suspicion of being \\"the bad guy/the traitor\\" for 2/3 of the novel before being redeemed when it's revealed they were just doing their job the entire time.  - A peppering of an elderly, sage helper who either reaches out to Langdon, or whom Langdon knew all along, to fill in those pesky blanks he couldn't figure out.  - For flavor, make sure your villian is so ridiculously, melodramatically diabolical that only the darkest heart could sympathize.  He should also be mysterious, a near-perfect physical specimen, highly trained in not only firearms but hand-to-hand combat, and comfortable with riddles and over-complicated revenge tactics.  And of course, he has a life-long blood feud against the secret society in question, whether or not they currently exist.  - Insert secret traitor here.  - Bake with a race-against-time urgency of no morethan twelve hours.  - Be sure to cool the anger of whichever secret group you pissed off by copping out at the end and revealing the assassin's hatred was misplaced under a black-and-white worldview because of some past emotional pain, and assure your reader that yes, this secret group does have positive aspects to it and was never really a threat in the first place.  - Don't forget to reveal your big ultra secret secret, no matter how stupid of a secret it may be, thereby making you wonder how this secret was ever kept for thousands of years, since everyone seems to be jumping at the chance to tell Langdon what it is.  - Happily ever after.      Bottom line: The Lost Symbol was a classic, albiet uninspired, Dan Brown novel, and I'm sad to say that is no longer a \\"good thing\\".  When compared to the much more earth-shaking consequences of Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, \\"Symbol\\"'s big twist falls flat on its face.  A video of self-proclaimed Masons performing their rights?  That's supposed to compete with the Vatican, all its knowledge, art, treasures and God knows how many people being blown to smithereens?  Hmmmm.  Tough to decide just which is more horrifying.    Angels and Demons was by far his best novel.  Da Vinci Code was an acceptable follow-up, though the aformentioned plot repetition had started to bother me about halfway through DVC.  Now that he's done it a third time, I just can't shake how ridiculous it is that he can't try just a LITTLE harder to build a realistic plot.    Also, the constant reminder from several minor characters about Brown's previous books was insulting. \\"This is the guy that ran from Interpol?\\" thought the guard.  \\"I've had run-ins with the Vatican,\\" revealed Robert.  Yes, Mr. Brown, we are well aware of Langdon's prior adventures.  Your constant reminders of the other books you've written come across as desperate as a girl waiting by the phone for a boy to ask her to the dance.    I'm actually sad my husband wasted his money giving this as a gift, and sad I was so excited to read it.  Bored to tears through much of it.  Do these mainstream writers even try anymore?
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Cold Roses is a raw, stripped-down set of music ranging from Rock, Folk Rock, Alt Country to Mellow Rock. Ryan Adams is a brilliant, if not somewhat manic, songwriter, known for a seemingly unending stream of music filling his head. Cold Roses perfectly demonstrates Adams' styles and competence, and there is something here for everyone - an absolutely awesome album. This is a magnificent set of CDs that everyone should own. GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Alt Country.    BUY IF YOU LIKE: Lucinda Williams, James McMurtry, Neil Young.

B000001H00|5.0|If you'd like to listen to Bach's Partitas played as they should be, this is the right CD.  Milstein's playing is exquisite, particularly the Chaconne.  The Sonatas are pretty good too, but Partita No. 2 is the highlight (as it should be)
B00005JO20|2.0|I agree with the reviewer who said: \\"just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.\\"    This movie begins well.  Naomi Watts is refreshingly subtle and the other cast members seem good.  The story gets a little muddled at times, but no worries, there's always the special effects to carry the movie.  Ah yes, the special effects.  Those ever growing special effects.  Bigger and badder than Kong himself.  In the beginning, they are used well to take the viewer back in time.  But once the story reaches Skull Island, forget the story and any sublimity; it all gets overdone.  Way overdone.  But as in cooking, in a photoplay you have to know when to let up.  You can't suddenly dump a bucket of chili powder in your tomato sauce to make good chili.    A light hearted adventure movie with great possibilities for scenery and reasonably fantastic creatures suddenly turns too menacing, with impossibly bleak occult and action scenes that no one would live with or through.  In a lesser example, my wife and I were laughing at all the guys who stayed on the log to get shaken off by Kong in a gloriously overdone rampage.  You gotta be smart to be believable.  People being chased don't stay on short bridges if they can help it, especially if someone has gone to the trouble to hold the line so they can escape.    Like so many action movies today, one feels the movie makers are trying to keep up with the giant amusement parks.  They need to take us to the imaginary, but also show a little restraint on the effects and keep it human, even develop the human relationships a little more to have a better balanced movie.  For instance, Ann and the writer on the boat--they mutter about in a couple of short encounters and then are suddenly in love.  They never have a real conversation.  At least have them standing on deck, leaning on the rail and looking at the sunset and discussing his play or something.  A counterpoint to the later sunset scene with Kong.    Oh well.  The cast members were good and Naomi Watts was rightly cast in Fay Wray's role.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|There's something missing but I don't know what it is. Overall I like this album, especially the song \\"Ignorance\\". The first time I heard of this band was when I heard of their song from the twilight soundtrack. I really like this group and I hope they continue to make more music.
0553582038|3.0|I hesitate to call \\"A Feast For Crows\\" disappointing, since Martin's style and voice ring true in unison with the first three books of the series; however, I did not enjoy this fourth installment as much as I did the previous.<br /><br />Martin has added too many points of view, stealing the story away from the characters we've come to cheer for, despise, or merely tolerate.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Jon Snow, Arya, and Tyrion as I did, you will find only Arya making appearance in \\"Feast\\"...and her appearances are few and far between. Coupled with the lack of Martin's progress on \\"Dances with Dragons\\", I cannot help but feel let down.<br /><br />Where I previously felt the fire of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", after reading \\"Feast\\" I only feel the ice.

B002HNA95E|3.0|Can't Warner Brothers just put out a straight greatest hits collection with the versions we all know and love? Why all the re-mixes and tinkering? You are better off cherry-picking the songs you want from the individual albums. That way , you get the original versions.    They did the same thing with the Prince double CD hits set a couple of years back, all the while not going back and re-mastering the individual albums, which is sorely needed.     Is it any wonder the mainstream music industry is in the shape that it's in? They can't get even get recent back catalog in order. Warner is particularly bad. If you can't re-issue Madonna and Prince correctly, what does that tell you?
B000B8QG0O|5.0|\\"Toy Story 2,\\" the Pixar computer-animated flick entertains us wildly, but also teaches a lesson: it's better to be a toy loved and played with by a child than be a toy admired in a collectibles museum. Woody the Cowboy (voice of Tom Hanks) is owned by Andy who accidentally almost rips his arm off.<br />Andy's mother puts broken toys out in her yard sale, and Woody, trying to save a fellow toy from the sale, inadvertently gets spotted at the sale by Al, a greedy toy collectible dealer. He gets stolen and taken away by the dealer. Woody's toy buddies trace the dealer and hunt him down in order to save their buddy.<br /> Woody learns that Woody the Cowboy had been a very popular puppet in a television series in the fifties. Toy Woodys were made as spin-offs back then. Now he's rare and valuable as a collectible especially to the Japanese market. One of the toy gang out to save Woody is Humm, a piggy bank (voice by John Ratzenberger - Cliff, the mailman on \\"Cheers\\".) Woody meets and falls for Cowgirl Jessie, and he encounters a bad toy, Stinky Pete, the Prospector (voice of Kelsey Grammer of \\"Frazier\\" fame.) The toy dealer calls in an expert restorer who cleans up Woody and reclaims the use of his arm.<br /> There are wild chases, escape scenes, some very close calls, and a lot of toy ingenuity. Don't underestimate the skill of toys engaged in a rescue operation. The action is non-stop, and the movie is great for all ages without adult references and innuendoes to throw the kids off. The scenes at the airport are scary and hair-raising. It's a toy trip that most people will enjoy.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I was introduced to PT with \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" a few years ago, so I'm a relative newbie in the PT fanbase.  After a few listens and picking up \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" I was convinced these guys were the greatest progressive rock band out there right now.  I snatched up their entire discography.    Its immediately evident from listening to the entire work from the band, in sequence, that they are not about sitting still stylistically.  They are more about creating audible art.  Steven Wilson is someone who takes the \\"art of music\\" quite seriously, and he is constantly allowing himself to be influenced by other artists... King Crimson and Opeth for example.  These influences invariably make their way into PT albums, and its clear that the band goes through \\"phases\\" where a particular style, phrase, or idea seems to be explored.  The most recent phase was initiated by \\"In Absentia\\" and featured a more heavy sound influenced by some of the great european progressive metal bands.  Over the past 2 albums that style has been slowly ebbing.    With \\"The Incident\\" we are definitely moving into different territory for PT in many respects.  Its still the \\"ambient progressive\\" sound it has always been, but there is less emphasis on intensity and technical passages and more emphasis on composition and dynamics.  The many stylistic tools that the band has absorbed over the years are put to good use here to paint a wonderful picture.  There seems to be pieces here from all phases in the PT discography, including some of Stevens solo work.    Now, some fans who are only familiar with material from In Absentia and later may not like this work at all, which probably explains some of the low ratings I've seen.  I would encourage those of you in this category to listen to the entire PT catalog and also SW \\"Insurgentes\\", a little bit of \\"Blackfield\\" and also \\"No Man\\"... you may gain a greater appreciation for \\"The Incident\\" and for what SW is trying to accomplish.    I remember when Rush released \\"Signals\\" after two killer rockin' albums \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\"... the reaction to the new sound was similar.  However, looking back \\"Signals\\" has become one of my favorite Rush albums.  I'm sure that for a lot of PT fans \\"The Incident\\" will be a similar revalation.    BTW I just saw them in Montreal... GREAT SHOW!!!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Overall Grade: A<br />Hilights: Uprising, United States of Eurasia (+Collateral Damage), Guiding Light, Exogenesis: Symphony Part 3 (Redemption)<br /><br />Now here's something you might not have expected! Muse has always held out as one of the last rock bands who can actually write epics, but \\"The Resistance\\" has far exceeded any of their previous works, including its predecessor \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\". The band provides a stunning soundtrack to the trials of life, love, and politics that features crashing guitars, sailing vocals, and incredibly intense songwriting. But wait! Just when you were about to call \\"Unites States of Eurasia\\" a tribute to Queen, the fire turns to water and the rock turns to Chopin. In an age when our rock music comes from American Idol and Disney, Muse has created a masterpiece, forging their own hybrid genre from classical and modern music. This is a must have, without a doubt!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I have been a fan since Facelift and throughout every CD, they have always been on top of the grunge scene.   AIC set in motion a series of artists who's music always roots back to them.  When Layne passed away it was very difficult to accept that there may never be another collection of songs.    When I listened to Blue Gives Way to Blue the first time, it struck me emotionally.   The songs are absolutely amazing.  I have to admit that at certain points listening to the songs I find myself on the verge of tears as I remember Layne and knowing we are blessed with another CD I never thought I would hear.      I hope this CD hits the top of the charts in every way.  I hope that this music will revive the music industry from the lack of great music over the last several years.  AIC inspired many at the end of the 20th century, lets see if they can pick it back up for the 21st and inspire even further.    Thank you Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney for bringing this back together and finding William DuVall.    Another masterpiece!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I tried the 30 Day Shred out this morning after having it for a few weeks.  I am not a DVD kind of workout person but I think this one may change all of that.  A friend of mine recommended this to me saying that it was like having a personal trainer and you know I think she's right!  That is what it was like.  Thankfully though Jillian could not see when I did stop to take a breath :) It is a well rounded, kind of intense workout that lasts for 20mins.  I think Jillian is right on with this one.

0316017922|4.0|I've only read two chapters of this currently popular work but the impression they left may be worth a comment or two.<br /><br />Gladwell isn't a scientist and that's not to his discredit.  Man, some scientists know how to write well (eg., Carl Sagan) while others produce verbal monstrosities.  Gladwell moves logically from topic to topic and isn't afraid to use rhetoric in a vernacular frame.<br /><br />I found his notions on the historical roots of homicide in the South, especially the feuds of the Appalachian families, to be fairly convincing.  You know, the Hatfields and McCoys, and dozens of others.  The settlers of Appalachia were from the Scottish/English borderlands and from rural Northern Ireland where the justice system was weak and self-protection and honor were part of everyday life.  Most of modern social science tends to disregard history.  It's been out of fashion for generations.  But that's a pretty radical thing to do -- to cut out all explanations of behavior patterns from their formative conditions.  Think of the information we're throwing away!  Anyway, he gathers evidence from various sources and outlines a \\"culture of honor\\" which promotes homicide as a proper response to repeated insults.  The homicide rate in the South is clearly higher than elsewhere in the country, even taking into account the more easily identified contributing variables.  But the murders are less likely than elsewhere to be for material gain.  They take place because one person insults another.  Gladwell has brought together a number of experimental studies that show the behavioral pattern exists even when Southerners migrate to expensive Northern colleges.  It's an impressive presentation.<br /><br />The other section I read was on the causes of airplane crashes, which the author traces to an index of what might be called \\"flight deck authoritarianism.\\"  You'd think that the more the relationship between the pilot and his first officer followed traditional lines, the greater the safety of the flight.  But no.  When the pilot is tired and needs to be warned that something is going wrong (or may go wrong), in authoritarian crews the first officer hesitates to bring up anything that sounds like a criticism of his boss.  So -- \\"Kaboom\\", as Gladwell might put it.<br /><br />I found what I've read to be fairly persuasive.  The \\"culture of honor\\" business is closer to my own field than airplane accidents, so I'm familiar with some of the material Gladwell uses and it's all scientifically respectable enough.<br /><br />But, in any case, it's so admirably written, so easily read and understood, that he deserves a big hand, even from those professionals on whose turf he's poaching.he flight.

0061719544|4.0|Cheers to Craig Ferguson's \\"American on Purpose\\", it is the most entertaining autobiography I've read in a very long time. The chapter style is short and sweet, each one giving you a nice chunk of that chapter in his life and still leaves you wanting more. This is not a sugar coated fluff piece, Craig's honest approach leaves no skeleton unburied. He simply paints himself as a flawed but humble human being. I laughed, I cried but most of all, this book made me proud to be an American! Happy reading.
B002GU5V24|2.0|Given the cost of this box set, it is a huge disappointment that there is no video material at all. I read over the pre-release information on the Rhino website and the official Genesis site, and was led to believe there would be live concert footage on the DVDs. Since the individual album re-releases (which were CD/DVD sets) contained many visual extras, I expected the same here. Sadly, the information on both sites was less than clear, rather confusing, and ultimately misleading. I've now spent my money on this box set and have come to find out that there is nothing but Audio on all of the discs. I love this music as much as anyone--Seconds Out and Three Sides Lives are excellent concerts--but do I need the same concert in Stereo, DTS audio, and Dolby 5.1? More frustrating is that each live album is packaged again as a CD/DVD, giving the impression that there is some video content, as with the studio albums. Why, why, why did they create so elaborate a box set with some of the best loved live performances and not give the fans any video from these concerts? Obviously, video is available, since some of it was included on earlier re-releases. If you were hoping to watch some concert footage, save your money. Seek out the bootlegs. If you want to listen to the concerts in multiple audio formats, go ahead and spend [...] or so. I feel cheated. I'm considering writing Rhino and asking for a refund.
B00192IV0O|3.0|I got this CD for my husband's birthday and he really likes only one or two songs on the CD. I thought the songs were pretty good but I didn't realize they swore in some songs. I only wish they had an edited version (uh, do they have one?) Other than that, I think it's a pretty good CD.
0131988425|5.0|This is the outstanding 3rd edition of Oppenheim's classic DSP book, which for over two decades was the only real choice for a textbook on the subject. That was too bad, since the first edition was probably the worst thing I have ever seen in print - terse, incomprehensible, and with only a few awful and poorly illustrated examples. When I decided to take a refresher course in DSP in 2006, I was horrified to see our class would be using the second edition of that horrendous text. What I found instead was a completely rehabilitated textbook! This was not a beginner's DSP textbook by any stretch of the imagination, but absolutely everything is explained and there are plenty of well worked out examples. The end-of-chapter problems were broken down into simple, intermediate, and advanced problems with quite a few mind-puzzlers in the advanced section. Plus, the answers to the first 20 problems in every chapter were in the back of the book.<br />There is really nothing unique about the book's format. What does makes the book unique is the density and amount of material included. Just about every page is packed with well-explained important information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had a prior semester of an upper-level undergraduate class in Signals and Systems and wants to study DSP. An accompanying book that you might find helpful is \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Lyons. That book is good for getting an intuitive feel for DSP. Another book that will help you with some of the earlier concepts in this book (linear systems, DTFT, Z-transform, DFT, basic filter design) and some of the direct computations involved is \\"Schaum's Outline of Digital Signal Processing\\". Amazon does not show the table of contents, so I do that here:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Discrete Time-Signals and Systems<br />3. The z-Transform<br />4. Sampling of Continuous-Time Signals<br />5. Transform Analysis of Linear Time-Invariant Systems<br />6. Structures for Discrete-Time Systems<br />7. Filter Design Techniques<br />8. The Discrete Fourier Transform<br />9. Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform<br />10. Fourier Analysis of Signals Using the Discrete Fourier Transform<br />11. Parametric Signal Modeling **<br />12. Discrete Hilbert Transforms<br />13. Cepstrum Analysis and Homomorphic Deconvolution **<br /><br />Appendix A. Random Signals<br />Appendix B. Continuous-Time Filters<br />Appendix C. Answers to Selected Basic Problems<br /><br />There are two new chapters in this third edition which I have marked with double asterisks. Previously cepstrum analysis and homomorphic convolution were mentioned in the second editon, primarily as just more advanced problems at the end of a chapter. All other chapters in the book remain essentially unchanged.  Thus this third edition seems to continue the tradition of the second edition and looks to be a worthy purchase and update.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|The Blu-ray looks fantastic.  For this classic film from 1937 to look so vibrant, so spectacular, so beautiful 72 years later is a testament towards Disney's restoration and remastering.  The picture quality is absolutely pristine.  The new lossless  7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is magnificent.  \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\\" is highly recommended!<br /><br />For Walt Disney, seeing a play back in 1916 of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" based on the fairty tale by the Brothers Grimm definitely made the producer to attempt something that has never been done before and that is to create a full-length color animated film.<br /><br />Known for their \\"Silly Symphony\\" animated shorts, the 1937 animated film definitely silenced anyone who thought that Disney was not able to pull off a full-length animated feature.  Even Walt Disney's wife thought that no one would want to watch a film that starred dwarfs but needless to say, the film that was called \\"Disney's Folly\\" by naysayers would receive critical praise and even demand by fans for a sequel.  The film would be not only be a classic animated film which was honored by the American Film Institute as the \\"Greatest Animation of All Time\\".  Even today, adjusted by inflation, the film is considered one of the top 10 money making films in America of all time.<br /><br />In 2001, when the \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" was released on DVD, the DVD was one of the films that were known for its innovation, winning a \\"Video Premiere Award\\" for \\"Best Overall New Extra Features\\" and nominated for \\"Best DVD Menu Design\\" and \\"Best New, Enhanced or Reconstructed Movie Scenes\\".<br /><br />But now in 2009, the film makes its High Definition entry on Blu-ray with 1080p High Definition picture quality and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound.  Also, a Disney Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack (two Blu-ray discs and a DVD version of the film) which comes out on October 6,  seven weeks before its Deluxe Two-Disc Classic standard definition DVD which will be released on Nov. 24th.  It's also important to note that a limited edition collector's set will also be available<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" gets its 1080p High Definition transfer and its absolutely beautiful.  Viewers can choose to watch the film in its original 4:3 (1:33:1)  format and watch it  with DisneyView featuring Tony Bluth's artwork on the side (for those who have widescreen televisions).  According to the guide included with this release, restoration experts took full advantage of the newest breakthroughs of digital imaging technologies to produce this classic.  The process took nearly a year of cleanup and scanning over 350,000 frames of the original 75-year-old negative.  And the digital artists then removed dust and scratches from the cels.<br /><br />The picture quality is absolutely beautiful for a film that is 72-years old.  The restoration and remastering has removed all dust and scratches.  I don't think I've seen any blemishes on video.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful as art backgrounds just look absolutely divine. I don't think I have realized how exquisite the backgrounds were, especially the amount of emotion that went into the animation.  Picture quality for \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\\" is definitely magnificent and I look forward to seeing Disney continue this trend of remastering their classic animated films.  As for DisneyView, similar to \\"Pinocchio\\", Toby Bluth's painted borders that are on the sides of the animation matches the animation quite fine and was definitely my preference over standard black bars.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), the original mono presentation and also French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT restored original theatrical soundtrack.  The film is dialogue and music driven with the soundtrackbeing front and center channel driven.  Music is also featured during the surround and rear surround channels as well.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and understandable.  During the more emotional sequences, such as Snow White running away from home in the forest, definitely makes the room quite immersive, albeit a short while but overall, a good use of utilizing the music of Snow White through all channels.  There are other parts that really come through on all channels such as a shriek by Snow White coming clear from the rear surrounds which was quite nice (and surprising).  Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack for a 72-year old animated film.<br /><br />As for the audio of the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\\" is absolutely loaded with special features.  In fact, I think this is the most special features I have ever seen for any video release of a film ever.  Special features range from 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Soundtrack is in English, French and Spanish 2.0.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Also is a booklet including a navigational overview of the special features included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />Special features included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Magic Mirror - Using the latest in Blu-ray technology, the iconic magic Mirror guides the audience through the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition features with ease, serving as the host for an incredibly immersive experience. The Mirror will recognize viewing patterns, knows where the audience has left off and will even suggest where to navigate next. This marks the first use of this technology in a Disney Blu-ray release and provides viewers with the control to personally create a customized Snow White experience.<br />  * DisneyView - Disney's pioneering animated feature is brought to the modern era of widescreen high definition viewing by allowing the user to expand their viewing experience beyond the original aspect ratio of the film. Utilizing Disney Blu-ray technology, acclaimed Disney artist Toby Bluth was able to draw beyond the borders of the classic full frame cinema and fill the otherwise dark edges of the screen with beautiful custom imagery, giving audiences a new view of the animated classic favorite.<br />  * About DisneyView - Disney artist Toby Bluth tells how the movie inspired him to create the superb DisneyView art.<br />  * Backstage Disney - Snow White Returns - (8:44) - Visiting Disney's Animation Research Library and finding newly discovered storyboards for a Snow White featurette that was never made.

Needless to say, the DVD won several awards for its technology and so, when the announcement came that \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" will receive a Diamond Edition Blu-ray disc release, I was curious to see how Disney could top themselves because that release was already phenomenal.<br /><br />I have since gone through the Blu-ray release and all I can say is...Wow!<br /><br />Disney has not only topped the Platinum Edition release, they have set the bar once again for a Blu-ray release and the amount of content that can be included on a Blu-ray and let alone, how awesome they were able to digitally restore the classic 1937 film.<br /><br />There was no doubt in my mind that Disney would give their first animated feature on Blu-ray the best treatment as possible and as this release is a celebration of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\", it's also a celebration of thetalent behind the film.  Those who were involved with Hyperion Studios that created the \\"Silly Symphonies\\" animated shorts back in the early 1930's and using the technology at that time and building it, in order to create their first full feature animated masterpiece.<br /><br />In fact, not only do we get audio of those who worked on the film but we also are treated with those classic animated shorts such as \\"Babes in the Woods\\", \\"The Skeleton Dance\\", \\"Music Land\\", \\"Goddess of Spring\\", \\"Playful Pluto\\", \\"The Old Mill\\", \\"Steamboat Willie\\" and more.  And to make things even more impressive, these shorts are featured in HD (not cleaned up but still much better than their DVD counterparts). This Blu-ray release manages to capture the various process of the film from creating the story, the music, the art, the backgrounds, the layout, the animation, the live action references, decisions at the sweatbox meetings, ink and paint and how women were involved in the animated process at the time, the camera department, soundstage, etc.<br /><br />So much is included on both Blu-ray discs in terms of special features, so much went into restoring this film, that this release is one, if not the top video releases of all time.  I have no doubt in my mind that probably ten years from now, this Blu-ray will be highly revered for its content.<br /><br />I know that many people own the 2001 Platinum DVD Edition of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" and are wondering if it's worth the double dip and the answer is YES!  There is just so much included on the Diamond Edition, way more than the 2001 Platinum Edition.  Also, if you are now wanting these classic Disney films in High Definition, its definitely worth the move to see this classic film in High Definiton.  But I must say that you should not toss away your 2001 DVD edition because there are video clips such as the \\"Excerpt from The Story of Silly Symphony\\", \\"Excerpt from Tricks of Our Trade\\", \\"Camera Tests\\", \\"Abandoned Concepts\\", vintage audio (radio shows and spots are not included) and several songs and deleted scenes which are not included on this Diamond Edition release.<br /><br />So, overall it's a no-brainer that \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\\" is definitely worth it.  For High Definition fans, the film looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  And as mentioned, the sheer amount of content included in this release is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />I really don't have any negatives but me being nitpicky that it would have been nice to have certain special features such as the vintage radio/audio content , a few deleted scenes, songs and video clip excerpts from the 2001 Platinum Edition DVD included on the Diamond Edition.  And personally, for me that is the only thing that prevents me from calling this release absolute perfection.  There was one other thing and that is my Blu-ray discs came in a black DVD case, not the standard blue casing.  I was told that there will be two releases (in different casing, not inc. the limited edition) with one in a blue Blu-ray case and another using black DVD casing in order to educate those new to Blu-ray.<br /><br />I do think that Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition are quite different in terms of presentation of special features and the goals were quite different of what kind of special features would be presented.  With the Platinum Edition, its solely focused on \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" and in the Diamond Edition, there is more focus on giving the viewer the history of Walt Disney and the animators of how they got from Silly Symphonies to using their skills and technology in creating the first animated feature film.  So, as I have said earlier in my review, this release is more or less, a celebration of those who worked on the film and giving recognition to those animators and staff members who took part in that film and the work that they did earlier, that became instrumental in creating Snow White.<br/><br />So, overall...the Diamond Edition is just incredible when it comes to the actual digital restoration of this classic film and a release that is absolutely packed with special features.  \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\\" is a solid release that raises the bar of what Disney is capable of in terms of content in a home video release.

B002HNA95E|4.0|This compilation is going to be criticized and praised over and over. No one is going to be completely happy with it.  But this is my take on it.  First and foremost, the two new songs on here, \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" are EXCELLENT.  Without a doubt.  If \\"Revolver\\" doesn't put Madonna back on the radio, nothing will.    The problem here is the fact that some of the omissions on this collection are not easy songs to find. For that reason alone this should have been a 3 cd collection, at least. \\"Gambler\\", \\"Spotlight\\", \\"The Look of Love\\", \\"American Pie\\" among others should have been included.  For no other reason than they were only on soundtracks and not on Madonna's full lengths, except for Spotlight on the remix album. Luckily for me i have them but they deserved to be on here.  Other omissions that I'm stumped on are, \\"Rain\\", \\"This used to be my Playground\\", \\"American Life\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Love dont Live Here Anymore\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Bad Girl\\" and the grossely underrated \\"You'll See\\".    This is an icon. Someone should have thought this out a little bit more.
0545157617|5.0|My 3 and a half year old son just simply adores Stick Man. Every night I send my son to his book shelf to select books for his night time reading, and since we have purchased this book, it has been selected every single night. We have loved all of Julia Donaldson's books (we own Snail and the Whale, The Gruffalo, The Gruffalo's child, Room on the Broom, The Spiffiest Giant in town and Monkey Puzzle) and this one is just as popular with me. I enjoy reading it to my son. As with all her stories, they are just the right length (not too long and not too short), have an engaging plot, really nice illustrations and appeal both to adults and children alike. Stick man has quite an adventure as he is mistaken for a stick and is then picked up one after another by a dog for a game of fetch, a girl for throwing into the river, a swan for building his nest, a father for a mast on a sand castle, a boy for an arm for a snowman and choir singers for firewood. He misses his stick family and wishes to be back with them. He finally makes it back home (I wont spoil your reading by saying how) just in time to celebrate Christmas with them. The story rhymes and the story line is very creative. I cant wait to get my hands on more of her books.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Bruce's best work has provided me with great pleasure over the years, but I cannot include this album in that hallowed category. Many fans are no doubt celebrating Bruce's latter-day prolificacy, but I suspect that they, along with Bruce's reputation and canon, might be better off if he was to slow down and concentrate on quality.    Indeed I sensed the shadowy silhouettes of a few good songs on Magic, but melodies are concealed in the cacophonic depths of an ear-rattling mix where generic guitars and drums are stirred into a morass of metallic noise. No discernible lyric (and not all of them were) caused me to stop and contemplate. This journeyman effort is almost unlistenable, and I can honestly state that I feel no compulsion to ever spin the disc again. I'm sending it to a Bruce-obsessed relative for her upcoming birthday - she will uncritically love it simply because it's The Boss.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The key question for me is: if I had never heard of Star Trek, and this were the first movie I had ever seen featuring these characters and situations, would I be panting at the end for a sequel? Would I want to see these people again? The answer, alas, would have to be no. Director J.J. Abrams and company have mounted a fast-paced, entertaining space opera of a sort that seems to have been lacking from cinemas for years, and for that they deserve props. But the glib Kirk, glum Spock, xenophobic McCoy and manic Mr Scott portrayed here would never make me think these are beloved characters I'd want to see again and again. Where's the witty twinkle hidden behind Spock's logical superiority? Where's the real sense of bonding among these three leads? I even liked the idea of advancing Uhuru more overtly into a sex symbol in this movie, but she's played as being as cold and cerebral as Spock. There's just no warmth. Meanwhile, the Romulan villain played by Eric Bana ain't much more intriguing than the villain of Star Trek V, widely seen as the worst Star Trek film. And this new Star Trek movie makes a huge logical lapse at the end by allowing cadet Kirk to leapfrog directly from academy cadet to Enterprise captain, all without passing Go or spending any time moving up the ranks. By the end of the film, I was entertained, but hardly ready to boldy go anywhere else with this particular crew.

1579126278|5.0|First of all, if anyone gives away the ending to this book before you've read it, feel free to commit a murder of your own. I'm sure that \\"they told me who killed Roger Ackroyd\\" would be a viable defense in court, THAT'S how renowned this book is as Agatha Christie's masterwork.<br /><br />Doctor James Sheppard is called to his friend Roger Ackroyd's house under strange circumstances: it would seem Mr Ackroyd has some news to impart. Once there, Sheppard discovers that the village rumors concerning one Mrs Ferrars were indeed true: several years ago she poisoned her husband, and recently confided in Ackroyd (who wished to marry her) that she was being blackmailed for her crime. Now Ackroyd is determined to find the culprit responsible.<br /><br />But before such a thing can occur, Sheppard is called back to the house on the basis of a strange telephone call. Once there, Sheppard and a member of the staff break down Ackroyd's study door to find him dead: stabbed to death in his chair. Suspicion falls particularly hard on Ralph Paton, Ackroyd's stepson, who has seemingly disappeared into thin air after Ackroyd's death. But as is to be expected, there are plenty more suspects to go around: the financially dependant sister-in-law and her daughter, the secretive maid, the proud housekeeper, the shifty valet, the visiting big-game hunter, the anonymous stranger seen entering the grounds on the night of the murder...<br /><br />But it is young Flora Ackroyd (Roger's niece) who enlists the help of Doctor Sheppard's new neighbor: an odd little Belgian who is said to be a retired detective whose only wish is to grow vegetable marrows.<br /><br />Naturally, Poirot cannot resist a good murder mystery, and is soon working alongside the police and Doctor Sheppard in order to track down the killer of Roger Ackroyd. Told in first-person narrative by Sheppard, the doctor takes the position usually held by Hastings (or for an earlier example, Sherlock's Doctor Watson) who is utterly unprepared for Poirot's methods of deduction, and caught entirely unawares - as is the reader - by the solution that he prepositions.<br /><br />\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is a murder mystery that is often described as one of perfect construction, and it's hard to argue with that claim. Everyone in the Ackroyd household as a secret, and although most of them are entirely incidental to the murder itself, each one is presented and revealed in its own time, along with the usual scattering of red herrings along the way. Poirot himself is at the top of his game, stimulating the \\"little grey cells\\" out of retirement and back into what he does best. It is Poirot's methods that make him so famous; relying on psychology just as much as deduction and logic, making seemingly irrelevant remarks and requests, acting insufferably arrogant in the accumulation of knowledge, and yet always secretive and impeccably polite; this is Poirot at his infuriating best.<br /><br />In many ways the plot of the book is analogous to Poirot himself: there is nothing flashy or gory or thrilling about it; in fact it is analytical and methodical; in many ways more like a mathematical equation in which all the expected pieces are in place and whittled down. Yet it is in this very act of presenting a \\"usual\\" murder mystery that Christie catches the reader off-guard. Ultimately, the real question of the book is not: \\"who killed Roger Ackroyd?\\" but \\"did Christie cheat?\\" I think not. One only need pay close attention to the surprisingly acute Caroline Sheppard (the precursor to Miss Marple) to concede that Christie is quite simply smarter than you are.<br /><br />Alongside [[ASIN:B001O9CEGY And Then There Were None]], \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is one of Agatha Christie's most important works, as both helped to define certain tropes of the detective novel. In the former's case, the concept of a group of people in an isolated area getting picked off one-by-one. In this case, it is the use of the \\"twist ending,\\" in which the entire premise of the book is turned on its head, forcing an immediate re-read in order to grasp the sheer ingenuity of the tale. This is Christie - and Poirot - and the murderer! - at their most cunning.ok is turned on its head, forcing an immediate re-read in order to grasp the sheer ingenuity of the tale.

1579126235|5.0|Undoubtedly, this is Agatha Christie's most renowned novel. Others have come close to its fame, and others perhaps even surpass it in their ingenuity, ([[ASIN:1579126278 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]; [[ASIN:B001O9CEGY And Then There Were None]]) but \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is the one story in Christie's vast collection of detective novels that absolutely everyone has heard of. Likewise, most (whether they've read the book or not) are probably aware of the solution to the crime, but if you are one of the few lucky souls who remain in the dark: consider yourself extremely fortunate and get your hands on a copy before it is given away in casual conversation! (And be careful pursuing these reviews - there's bound to be someone who discusses the ending).<br /><br />Poirot is returning home from Syria and meets up with his good friend Monsieur Bouc, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, who helps him abroad the Orient Express. Oddly enough for this time of year, the train is full of passengers of varied nationalities, including a man known as Samuel Ratchett. Ratchett approaches Poirot with a request: having received several anonymous death threats, the American wants Poirot to investigate the situation and provide some semblance of protection. Disliking the man, Poirot refuses.<br /><br />The following morning, Ratchett is found dead, having been stabbed twelve times in the chest in a rather erratic manner. To make matters worse, the train has become stuck in a blizzard in Yugoslavia, and Monsieur Bouc begs Poirot to investigate so as not to involve the added complication of governmental red tape. Poirot obliges, and what follows is an investigation that relies almost solely on Poirot's interviews with the passengers. Ascertaining that Ratchett was in fact a gangster responsible for the kidnapping and murder of a child, Poirot plumbs the psychological depths of his fellow passengers in order to see who had the motive and opportunity to do the deed.<br /><br />The novel is based on two true events that happened in Christie's lifetime, the first being the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son (an investigation which involved a maid of the household committing suicide after being interrogated by the police on suspicion of her involvement), and the second being Christie's personal experience on the Orient Express in 1931 in which she and other passengers were trapped on board due to the flooding of the track (during which she was said to have met a woman who directly inspired the character of Mrs Hubbard). In the 1970s it was adapted into what is considered the most successful movie adaptation of a Christie novel ever: [[ASIN:B0002I832C Murder on the Orient Express]], starring Albert Finney as the Belgian detective. There are current plans to adapt it for a second time in the David Suchet television series.<br /><br />The real Orient Express is shrouded in intrigue and glamour (featuring in Bram Stoker's [[ASIN:0743477367 Dracula]] and Ian Fleming's James Bond novel [[ASIN:0142002070 From Russia with Love]] - heck, illusionist David Copperfield even made one of its dinner carriages disappear!) and Christie only adds to its mystique with this novel. As such, this is one of Christie's more atmospheric novels, as well as her most sophisticated. The claustrophobic conditions of the snow-bound train somehow heighten the sense of darkness and mystery, and the circumstance of the event that drives the entire plot (the death of a little girl) imbues the entire book with an inescapable sense of tragedy and grief.<br /><br />Make no mistake; this is Christie at the height of her powers.

I watch it for my own enterntaintment purposes.  What I would like to read here is about the quality of the Blu Ray! How well does it play on your 1080p LCD, aspect ratio, sound quality, True HD, is it worth it to add it your collection, etc!
B0029LHW4U|3.0|I have a lot of mixed feelings regarding this release so I will break it up into pros & cons.    Pros:      Duvall does a great job filling in for Layne.  When you consider the fact that duplicating Layne's voice is impossible you have to give Duvall credit.  Duvall also gets brownie points for being excellent during live AIC performances.    Cantrell is amazing on guitar and this album yields no exception that statement.    This record is better than top records of most new bands today (Breaking Benjamin, Seether, 3 Days Grace, & Nickelback to name a few), even without Layne and even considering the fact that this is arguably AIC's worst album.    Cons:    This is AIC's worst album.  Furthermore, every album since Dirt has gotten progressively worse.  Even if Layne were still alive I have doubts as to whether or not AIC could ever match the quality of Dirt or Facelift again.  The trademark snarl of Layne started to disappear after Dirt and the band seemed to be moving into a more contemporary role.  While I feel that the acoustic sets were amazing (and they still are even without Layne) I feel a part of the band was laid to waste after the release of Dirt.    It is one thing if the songs have similar meanings but when I listen to this album I believe the meanings here are TOO SIMILAR (not sure if other listeners feel the same way).  In a way I feel like the band is saying that it was easier for Layne to die than it was to get off drugs - which as another poster said was not the case.  Examples of this can be found on \\"Your Decision\\", \\"A Looking In View\\", and \\"Private Hell\\".  On the other hand, AIC has always been known to state the worst of truths within their songs so I'm not sure if this is necessarily a bad thing here.  On the final track \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" I believe the band pays a proper tribute to Layne.    A Looking in View gets boring after 3 minutes into the song.    Conclusion:  If you are a diehard AIC fan you should buy this album.  You will likeat least half of the songs and that alone makes the purchase worthwhile.  On top of this, from seeing AIC live with DuVall, I am all for supporting the continuation of this group as long as the music doesn't become too commercial.  Don't expect Layne to show up on this album but expect excellent guitar work from Cantrell and adequate vocals from DuVall.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I wish I could give Revolver one thousand stars.<br /><br />Lucky me... I can honestly say I'd never heard Revolver from start to finish until I purchased this remaster.  I can't quibble about how it stands up to the vinyl.  Somehow this one passed me by when I was younger.  My family moved a lot the year this came out and I was still a little young (11) to be buying records - I had no money.  I listened to what my older sisters were buying (which wasn't much, we were a poor family).  The first Lp I purchased \\"while it was happening\\" was Magical Mystery Tour and then I purchased Pepper and everything post-Pepper as it was released.  Rather than go back to the earlier stuff, I copped out and bought the \\"Red\\" album to get a taste of the earlier stuff. But I digress.<br /><br />I'm mostly a fan of jazz music these days and I'm also a jazz guitar player.  However, I've maintained deep affection for rock music, especially from this era - Beatles, Stones, Yardbirds, Pretty Things, and so on.  I own hundreds of CDs (mostly jazz but lots of rock too) and I can honestly say that... in my humble opinion... this is the greatest rock record ever made.  Everyone likes to point at Pepper and while I love that one too, some how I don't connect as much with the tunes on that release.  I can connect to everything on Revolver whether it is written by Lennon, McCartney or Harrison.  I think one of the things I like so much about this is the layers of dubbing and clever studio trickery are not nearly so thick as on the Pepper release. I can understand what is going on in this music, even in the harmonies.<br /><br />I have three small points to make about Revolver but these in no way tarnish this incredible work of art:<br /><br />1.  The \\"documentary\\" is really no big deal, mostly still shots with voice overs and everything said is lifted from The Beatles Anthology TV series.<br />2.  Lennon makes the comment that this was the first record to use backward masking.  That is not correct.  Zappa and The Mothers of Invention's Freak Out! (recorded in late '65 and early '66 was the first).  There's a lot of backward masking on piano on Freak Out!  However, Revolver is infinitely more listen-able and way cooler :)<br />3.  Revolver isn't long enough...  I want MORE of this pre-Pepper music.<br /><br />Buy it, it's simply fabulous.  It is to Rock what Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is to jazz.ion's Freak Out! (recorded in late '65 and early '66 was the first).  There's a lot of backward masking on piano on Freak Out!  However, Revolver is infinitely more listen-able and way cooler :)  3.  Revolver isn't long enough...  I want MORE of this pre-Pepper music.    Buy it, it's simply fabulous.  It is to Rock what Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is to jazz.
0786852550|1.0|Well I just I can not recommend it. On each page there are explanatory footnotes to references made within the paragraphs that are altogether more interesting than the story line. Bartimaeus is some kind of ultra powerful demon, djinn, or spirit that gets summoned by a 12 year old and sent off to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand - lackluster adventure ensues. I would not recommend this trilogy to any of your younger relatives. Very disappointing.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|Now, to be straight here, I am a largely biased Skynyrd fan, and love the band (older and newer).  I've admired how they keep on truckin' - no matter what.    This is a very good record with a lot of soulful and to the point lyrics.  The songs are good, but I think this album lacks a bit of the guitar work that has driven many of the bands songs.  Not just the leads, because you can have only so many solos, but the use of co-writers seems to have permeated a bit too much in some tunes.    I still give it a 4-star because they keep going on, no matter what.  I just think that if you're looking for alot of the guitar attack of the past, you may be a bit disappointed.  There's still the good \\"skynyrd nation\\" which is a great, great fist pumper.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Talking Heads was MY band during high school and college (1979-1987).  I can still remember as if it were yesterday the first time I saw them on \\"Saturday Night Live.\\"  I haven't listened to them that much thought in last 15 years.    I have a HD projector that projects a 141\\" diagonal image on the wall.  I'm using the Pioneer stereo/speakers I bought with grass cutting money in 1979 for the sound system.  It can still shake the whole house at half volume.  This really is home theater.    I got on a kick recently watching concert videos.  Led Zeppelin is great, Rolling Stones stunk and Elvis was OK.  I about cried though when I watched the Talking Heads, \\"Stop Making Sense.\\"  The quality of the video, audio, cinematography, musicians and staging is the best, no comparison.  Watching this concert took 30 years off my age as I watched it.  This movie really showcases the Talking Heads at their best and this concert is why I loved them so much when I was a kid.  I've watched it twice already and I can't see getting tired of it anytime soon.
B002HNA95E|4.0|While I am a huge fan of Madonna's older music and I was excited that they would finally be releasing a greatest hits package with all songs remastered. When I finally saw the setlist for the album, I was stunned. First off, I would loved if all the songs would of been in cronical order. Second, that all the songs are not edited, but can be. For example, I do prefer the 1990 remix of \\"Express Yourself\\" over the original. Lastly, she missed alot of great songs and many that were big hits that have still never seen the light of day. I would released this album as a 4 disc collection and my setlist would look like this. I put a * next to each one not included on this collection    1. Everybody  2. Holiday  3. Borderline  4. Lucky Star  5. Burning Up  6. Like A Virgin  7. Material Girl  8. Crazy For You  9. Gambler*  10. Angel*  11. Dress You Up  12. Into The Groove  13. Live To Tell  14. Papa Don't Preach  15.

She left out alot of gems in this one, but I do like how they remastered all the tracks but then again, too many edits. Hopefully they will release another collection in the future and it will something like this.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I recently used this video with my senior students.  I teach in a low economic area of Los Angeles.  The students responded well to it and were able to follow the plot except for the one section where the troupe of actors comes to perform at Elsinore.  This whole section is a giant actor-manager-playwright in-joke that Shakespeare inserted but which my students were mystified by.  Additionally, I had to explain to them that Hamlet is requesting the players to alter the play to look more like the scene of his father's murder.    The costume and staging of the play are subdued and not distracting. The acting...that is the movement of the characters and their facial expressions are well done enough that my students could interpret emotions even without understanding the words.    There are some surprise cameos:  Robin Williams, Charleton Heston, etc.    Overall, Branagh has done a great job with the staging of this play and it works well with students.
0142000663|4.0|The shipping for this book is really quick, and I m satisfied for the book I got. It new, no scratch, no note inside!
0385504225|2.0|I guessed the location of the latest secret find in the first 20 pages. I didn't guess what it would turn out to be. Suffice it to say, WHAT? That's it? LLLLLLAAAAAMMMMMEEEEEE.    Sigh.
0385504225|1.0|I read all four of Dan Brown's previous novels. I liked them, enjoyed them, and I thought they were stories that really made you think and open your mind to new ideas. The Lost Symbol is a BIG disappointment. The ending is an INSULT to the reader's intelligence. After all the build up, the ending was a let down. I will not spoil it for those who already bought it and may already be reading it. They may like the story. BUT, I am certain that MOST of the readers, especially those who read Brown's previous books, will be disappointed. If I knew what I know now about this book, I will not buy it, and I definitely will not spend, or a better word is waste, my time on this book.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Disney has been most generous of late in guiding their customers toward the future by releaseing titles such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as reasonably priced combo packs that include both the DVD and Blu-ray discs.  Since there are many who long to make the switch to high definition but haven't quite committed, these sets allow them to enjoy the experience on standard DVD for the time being, and then when they finally do go Blu-ray, they won't have to re-purchase the disc...they'll already be set, and finally see what they've been missing.    It's the Blu-ray I want to pay more attention to, because if you think this movie has looked glorious on past digital issues (and it certainly has), you are in for a revelation that will leave you smiling and speechless.  If you didn't know, you'd never EVER believe this was a seven-decades plus old movie.  It is absolutely pristine and spotless in a new 1080p transfer.  The colors are more vibrant and beautiful than ever before, and all the incredible detail of Walt Disney's imaginative direction renders through with a clarity I would dare say not seen since 1937 movie screens.    After a quick comparison, I cannot tell you that the effort Disney put into the DVD presentation is worth any less than four stars in its own right, but such a comparison is inherently unfair.  Or, at least it WOULD be, except that Disney gives us both in one package.  The DVD is clean, clear, and colorful, and will certainly make fans without Blu-ray exceedingly happy...but again, Disney uses Blu-ray technology to the absolute apex of its capabilities here.  There's nothing like seeing a true cinematic classic looking more stunning than ever before, and Disney and Blu-ray teamed together offer fans nothing less than that kind of experience.    Also, with this combo pack, you can opt for the experience your home theatre allows.  With both discs, you can experience the film with a restored original mono soundtrack...intriguing for purists, butfor me, you have to go with one of the digital surround remixes.  On the DVD, you get the terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, and on the Blu-ray, a brand new uncompressed DTS 7.1 offering.    Disney's use of technology for these new mixes is respectful; they don't try and create an experience that Walt never intended, but by opening up the dynamic range, giving the bigger scenes a little more space on the front and middle stages, and using the subwoofer to add a little more menace to the scarier scenes, the original experience is not lost, but simply enhanced.  And the musical orchestrations sound more vivid and lush than ever before...a wonderful audio presentation!    Going from Platinum to Diamond in status makes me wonder if there are enough precious and rare materials in the world for future Disney editions...but no matter.  This Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo pack offers hours and hours of fun, informative and interactive features.  I'm sure to miss a few, so forgive me, but I will try to be as complete and organized as I can.    With either disc one (DVD) or disc two (Blu-ray), you can enjoy a commentary with animation historian John Canemaker, featuring archival clips of the late great Walt Disney offering his thoughts on his breakthrough achievement.  There is also a new music video for \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" from Disney Channel star Tiffany Thornton, plus a sneak peak at the studio's next big offering The Princess and the Frog.      The second Blu-ray disc offers some Family Play games through BD LIVE...you can play alone, or you can challenge others to beat your scores.  \\"Jewel Jumble\\" is a neat twist on stacking games like Tetris, while \\"Mirror Mirror\\" will show you which princess you're most like...I opted not to play that one.  \\"What Do You See?\\" challenges you as to how fast you can recognize a blurry image coming into focus.    A very cool and very new extra is the archival look at a film that was never made: \\"Snow White Returns\\".  Using recently discovered artwork and notes, we can get a feel of what a planned but ultimately scrapped sequel might have been like.  Some classic extras are here as well...two animated scenes that were never completed and cut from the film, including the famous soup bowl song and the dwarfs building a bed together.  Enhanced View mode fills the black bars at the left and right (this film is in its original 1.33:1 mode) with some lovely and comparable artwork from Toby Bluth.    The third disc, also for Blu-ray, contains more bonus features from the previous Platinum Edition DVD, including one of my favorite interactive games, \\"Dopey's Wild Mine Ride\\".  Can you race through the mines and gather your friends in time to save Snow White?  There is also a look back at Walt Disney's original Hyperion Studios, the retrospective Snow White featurette \\"The One That Started it All\\", a look at the voice talents, the \\"Disney Through the Decades\\" featurette, and the \\"Heigh-Ho\\" karaoke sing-along.    A genuine classic has gotten the kind of treatment high definition fans would hope for, but thanks to this Diamond Edition combo pack, all fans of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can enjoy a beautiful and feature-packed presentation.  Then, for those who don't have Blu-ray and eventually get one, they will have the chance to see what they've been missing, and wonder why they waited so long!
0743298039|2.0|Um, has no one realized that Adeline and Emmaline would be easily distinguishable?  Emmaline has a baby.  She also has milk.  She also has changes in her body below the waist.   Being cared for as she is, it would be an obvious thing to check.    In spite of being twins, there are individual marks, especially on Emmaline, from all the beatings inflicted upon her by her sister.    This unsatisfactory and dishonest ending ruined an otherwise adequate book for me.        I say adequate because, although I grew to like Vida Winter, I was more and more put off by the morbid self-pity of the narrator and the psuedo-mystery of her twin's demise.     For me, this book was a mere pot-boiler.   Settleton is a fine word crafter, and can spin a twisty turny plot, but she has yet to learn honesty.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I know others will go deep with analysis of this product, so I will just state what I think is the most important element.  This show seems to have been edited by someone who is not only aware of this type of music, but also a fan.  I cannot handle nonstop 2 second cuts to every camera view that I could care less about.  The days of the frantic MTV style video presentation are OVER.  This DVD is perfect in that aspect, when Steve is going for the \\"part\\", you WILL get to see it.  And there is also just the right amount of effects and movement to keep it interesting & fresh.  Any musician who actually cares about the music, should pay attention to \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and use this as a reference point for any Producer or Director who will be in charge of presenting an artists true vision in the arena of concert recording.  For me: The Perfect Concert DVD  HUNT4MUSIC
B0029LHW4U|5.0|...if you belong to the following groups:  1. You never listen to Heaven Beside You, Over Now, Brother or Killer Is Me because Jerry is the main lead so it doesn't sound like \\"AIC\\" to you.  2. You believe Jerry, Mike and Sean would've been nobodies without Layne. Or you forget that AIC was not \\"The Layne Staley Band\\" (just like it wasn't \\"The Jerry Cantrell Band\\", either) and deny that there are three people who had every right to make this decision, those three not including any fans.  3. You expect another \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Facelift\\". Or you believe that a band must sound like 14+ years ago, no matter how much the band members have changed as an artist and as a person (for better or worse, doesn't matter) in that time. (Which sounds pretty ridiculous if you apply it to everyday people, doesn't it?)    God knows I wish a healthy, happy Layne Staley was still among us. But it's not the case. So I'm just happy that at least we didn't lose the whole band. I'm deeply saddened and ashamed of all this bickering going on about band names and pointing fingers who should've done what to help Layne and condemning the remaining band members in Layne's name. Anybody who thinks that the comeback was an easy decision for the guys or that it's all about money is judgemental beyond redemption. If anything, keeping the name \\"Alice In Chains\\" gave them a disadvantage because of all the high expectations and - as we can see - additional mud throwing.    Beware, I'm partial towards Jerry Cantrell's work, I love his solo albums and never really separated them from the AIC discography (just like my Stone Gossard/Brad CDs are happily mingling with my PJ stuff). Having clarified this, I can only say that this album didn't betray my faith in the guys. I won't describe the songs in detail here because others did a great job on that. One can find fault with things like William getting unexpectedly little spotlight or Jerry's solos not being as bombastic as back in the days but I still love every song on this record. Not one filler and even if it won't be everybody's fav AIC album, it definitely lives up to the band's name. 5 stars from me.
0307269981|5.0|Did not expect this plot to be as  good as it was.  Really liked his first book, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but I'm always leary of sequels.  They never seem to be as good as the original.  This book was the exception.  The plot was fast paced and kept you on the edge of your seat.  I had some problems keeping track of all the characters.  Swedish names weren't easy to remember.  But that is not a criticism, just an observation.  Read this book and I predict you will be as anxious as I am for the third book in this series, due out in May.

When I  got the cd I did not wait I play it right away and do I love it  I have to say I play it for few hours.
1932100660|5.0|In many senses this book was even better than I thought after reading other reviews.    On the plus side: It's very clear and carefully written with the general public in mind; and it is adequate for people familiar with the subject as well. It demonstrates clearly and solidly why we need to abandon the animal based diet and provides hard data by comparing full dietary habits in the western economically developed countries against full dietary habits in underdeveloped countires like asia. It cites a lot of references to the supporting evidence and studies. It also makes the case clear as why the nutrion suplement approach, the isolated nutritient views, the isolated concerns for fat, and the isolated concerns for carbohydrates are flawed.    On the flip side: Since so many diseases turn out to be correleated to nutrition and diet, I found myself eager to get even more data and explanations inside this book, but space isn't enough and it would have required a thousand pages; so the authors provide only the leads for the rest of the evidence. You will need to search for the references to read further. As a result, this book might look superficial to doctors, nutrionists, scientists or people already knowledgable in this subject.    You'll love this book: If you are open-minded, if you are looking for ways to improve your health in the long term, if you are looking to understand nutrition in society, if you are willing to make drastic changes in your diet to help yourself.    You'll hate this book: If you're not willing to give up your dietary habits, if you believe that what has been taught to you must be right, if you're looking for simplistic explanations on diet effects on health, if you're looking for direct and isolated causes for particular diseases, if you're just looking for specific diet tips to mitigate an affection.    Regarding delivery but unrelated to the rate I picked, I had to wait two full months for this book compared to a second book that arrived injust 10 days. The tracking number provided is pretty useless on standard international shipments as it can't be used to query the local carrier in Mexico. I hope this is improved in the future.
140120841X|5.0|I will admit that I had never heard of V for Vendetta until the movie, a movie which has stood as one of my favorites of all time ever since I viewed it.  However, eventually I got around to reading the graphic novel, and after having done so, I can't decide which I love more.  All I know is that V for Vendetta, in either form, equals greatness.<br /><br />Moore's story takes place in a not-to-distant Britain in a world that has, for the most part, fallen apart.  Disease and economic collapse run rampant outside of England, and is kept out seemingly by the strong hand of a fascist government that \\"saved\\" the nation.  Now, however, a mysterious man wants revenge on those who rule the country, and he plans to gain his vengeance while bringing the entire government down around him.  \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their government-government's should be afraid of their people.\\"<br /><br />Do you like Watchmen or any of Moore's other work?  If you do, then you'll like this.  Do you like the movie?  If so, you'll like this.  Do you like a good, strong story that will challenge your preconceived notions of how mankind should operate?  If so, then you'll most definitely like this.
0790729725|5.0|This is one the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. If you have never seen this movie you might as well just shoot your self.
0930289234|5.0|There's a reason that Watchmen is considered to be on of the best, if not the best, graphic novel of all time.  That reason is...that it really is just that good.<br /><br />Follow a group of has-been \\"masked adventurers\\" and one superhero in an alternate version of the Nixon era as they seek to uncover a dark plot behind the murder of one of their own.<br /><br />Moore's story is unmatchable, containing cultural criticism and ethical dilemmas that will challenge the beliefs of the most set minds.  The art is fantastic, the characters are timeless, and you, as the reader, cannot be disappointed.
0061719544|5.0|Craig Ferguson has always been able to make me laugh.  I've seen some of his standup, and he can be it-hurts-your-face-to-laugh-so-hard funny.  So, I was expecting his memoir to be amusing.  What I wasn't expecting was that it would be so brutally honest about his issues with alcohol.  I admired his forthrightness and his refusal to gloss over some of the uglier aspects of alcoholism.  An uplifting tale of failure, redemption, success, and finally learning how to be happy with the blessings you've been given.  Welcome to America, Craig!  We're lucky to have you.
B0027G783W|1.0|I have loved Moby music forever. I have been anticipating this show in Minneapolis 10/01/09 FOR FREAKIN' EVER. I was home by 9:30 pm from this show. It royally sucked. Yes, perhaps it was impartial to Minneapolis, but STILL! The album, \\"Wait For Me\\" sucks too. I downloaded it from Amazon.com via MP3 download two months ago. Moby, \\"Wait for Me\\" is a lazy disaster that should be ignored completely. ABSOLUTE BOOOOOO! FFFFFFFF off Moby!
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Chances are that you're familiar with [REC] already, thanks to its Americanized remake from last year, which was re-titled Quarantine.  Well, thankfully, the original Spanish handheld horror film is finally here on DVD, and we should all be glad that it is.  If you've seen Quarantine, the story of [REC] is the same so I won't go into details, but let it be said that [REC] is nothing short of terrifying.  If the whole handheld horror genre, with films such as Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, and Blair Witch among others don't really do it for you, [REC] won't really change your mind, but that aside, it remains that this film is one of the most effective and shocking horror films that you'll ever come across.  As said before, Quarantine copied so much of the imagery of [REC] that if you've already seen that film, you won't be surprised by much of what you find here, but if you haven't seen Quarantine, make sure that [REC] finds a place in your DVD player first and foremost.  And even if you have seen Quarantine, check out [REC] anyway, and see how it was done first and best.
0385504225|4.0|Many reviewers have been knocking The Lost Symbol because of various literary qualities.  And I'd have to say that most, if not all, of those assertions are true.  But to me, that's immaterial.  I like to think that I'm like most readers -- I read for the story, not necessarily the literary value.  Subsequently, I have equated The Lost Symbol with a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford movie, for example.  That genre is seldom known for its supremely fine acting, character depth, cultural significance, etc.  But yet they make millions of dollars because people go see those movies for their entertainment value.      The Lost Symbol, for those of us who read to simply enjoy a creative story, is a good, creative, fast-paced read.  The character development is decent -- enough to get a fair idea of who's who in the story -- even though some of the characters are a bit too stereotypical.  There is some predictability to it, but not a great deal.  In short, it is an entertaining book - which is all I'm really looking for, for my money.  One of the somewhat unique characteristics, however, is that it is written in real time, and that helps keep the story moving at a brisk pace.    My only knock would be that it is essentially The DaVinci Code but set in Washington, DC, with the Free Masons substituting for the Templars.  That, and it clearly seems that it is written in such a way as to be easily adaptable for a screenplay for future movie release (in fact, Wikipedia reports a tentative 2012 release for The Lost Symbol movie).    Bottom line?  If you're looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn't it.  If you're looking for a fast-paced, entertaining read and you enjoyed The DaVinci Code, then you'll like The Lost Symbol.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I HAD SAW ALL THE REVIEWS FOR AMAZON REGARDING THE VIDEO QUALITY AND I HAD DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE VIDEO FOR MYSELF. ONE THING THAT MADONNA LOVERS REMEMBER IS THAT THESE VIDEOS WERE MADE IN THE 80'S.. IN A TIME WHERE DVDS AND HD AND 1080P'S DIDNT EXIST. THESE VIDEOS ALL ARE OF GOOD QUALITY.. YOU DO SEE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU WATCH THE NEWER ONES, BUT I THINK OTHERS VIEWERS EXPECTATIONS WERE WAY TOO OVERDRAWN. SO IF YOU'RE NOT A HD ONLY TYPE OF PERSON THESE VIDS ARE GREAT. ITS DEFINTELY A COLLECTION WORTH HAVING FROM THE QUEEN OF POP. I HAVE BEEN A MADONNA FAN SINCE DAY ONE AND IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH THESE FROM START TO FINSH AND TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION UNFOLD.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|The zombie invasion of Hollywood has officially reached critical mass with the release of the coming-of-age horror/comedy \\"Zombieland\\".  Whether it's novels like[[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z]] and recent audaciously-titled bestseller [[ASIN:1594743347 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]], the countless small and big budget films from America and abroad, or a slew of ultra-popular video games like [[ASIN:B000QY9C90 Left 4 Dead]] and [[ASIN:B000F3AADE Dead Rising]] preparing us for the inevitable zombie holocaust, the zombie craze is increasing not only in visibility and volume, but in quality as well.  \\"Zombieland\\" is both a tribute to and culmination of that craze.  But could America possibly reach the bar set by our friends in the UK with [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]]?  In a word: no.  But \\"Zombieland\\" does make one point for me that I've been trying to make for years.  Everything is better with zombies.<br /><br />I walked into the theater hoping for the raw energy and insanity of Peter Jackson's [[ASIN:157362408X Dead Alive]].  And for the first act, I got it.  Halfway into the opening slow motion zombie attack montage featuring among other things a stripper zombie with tassels, Metallica's best song, and what appears to be our good friend Zombie McCain I thought I could write this review in three words: best. movie. ever.  The humor of the film is king for the introductory sequences.  Absurdity, grotesque violence, profanity, black humor, clever jokes involving a set of zombie apocalypse survival rules (seatbelts...who knew?), and pure comic genius introduce us to the former United States of America, since affectionately renamed Zombieland.  Our hero: a pipsqueak trying to get home to Columbus, Ohio.  We will know him only as Columbus since people in this brave new world are only identified by their destination of choice.  That is bleak.  Even George Romero thinks that is an excessively harsh view of post-zombie humanity.  I love it.  Columbus meets up with zombie-slaying machine Tallahassee (played by the coolness-defining Woody Harrellson) who is in search of the last Twinkie on Earth and off we go.  Tallahassee is the kind of dude who steps into a building playing a banjo to attract zombies so he can then beat them to death with the banjo.  But not without making a [[ASIN:B000RTB0R6 Deliverance]] joke first.  Classic.<br /><br />So best movie ever, yes?  Sorry, no.  Slowly, as the zombies seemed to almost vanish from the story and Columbus's inner dialogue turned from black comedy to typical teenager stuff, the realization creeped up on me that I was watching a rather typical modern coming-of-age comedy.  Oh, yes I was.  It was all about his search for family and the memories lost to the end of civilization and lots of mushiness.  This was way more like [[ASIN:B002BFBAWO Adventureland]] and much less like the awesomeness that opened the film.  Not to knock the slew of comedies that focus on likable characters, awkward romance, and the true value of the little things in life like friendship and Twinkies.  They're fine films, really.  I just hoped for something more awesome is all.  Zombie McCain is awesome.  But I digress.  Great film, but it turned out more typical then what I was hoping for, and the climax was a little stupid in several ways.  That's the only bad.  Here's more good.<br /><br />This film has exactly 5 characters in it.  Everybody else is an extra.  The small cast makes for good character development in the four main heroes.  The fifth character is a distinguished actor and one of the all-time comedic greats.  I will not spoil who it is, (and you'd better not be the jerk who does) but the worshipfulness heaped upon him in this role is practically a genre of comedy unto itself.  Even with such a silly done-to-death premise, this movie has a big heart.  It may have even made me a little misty-eyed at one point.  Not that I'd admit something like that.  After all, fire up some \\"Left 4 Dead\\" and I makeTallahassee look like a lightweight.  Speaking of being a goddamn geek, Columbus struck me as a very relatable protagonist.  Coulda been me living the life of a shut-in playing \\"World of Warcraft\\" and drinking Code Red Mountain Dew and then totally owning the zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" will be a good time for most everyone who takes the ride, but I think some of the other mentally ill among us might be a tad disappointed as I was. I wanted more zombie kills of the week and less stories about having no date for Sadie Hawkins'.  I'm sick that way.  Still, awesome cast, great premise, more gore then any recent comedy and most recent horror movies, a really twisted sense of humor and zombies zombies ZOMBIES should be more then enough to warrant you getting off your duff and giving this flick some love.  I guarantee it's better then whatever other putrid Hollywood garbage you were considering seeing instead.  Shame on you!a lightweight.

B001AQTWF2|3.0|It was disappointing that such a great artist with such a great voice is reduced to recording just a collection of rather ordinary pop songs.  So if you want a collection of well sung pop songs - well why not.  But if you are wanting Whitney Houston - buy an old CD.
B0007Y08PQ|1.0|Behind and before the plot, all the setpieces in place make for a gorgeous tale of gray-scope morality, moral dilemmas, and ethical concerns.<br /><br />Instead, the writers make the crew stick logic up our asses and go the hippie-liberal \\"Screw you, coherency!\\" route, while proceeding to arbitrarily make the \\"bad guys\\" seem irredeemably evil... about midway through the film.<br /><br />The story set up is one with some very faint racist undertones, involving a group of \\"perfect\\" people living in a pre-industrial \\"utopia\\", and their planet happens to have some sort of natural thing which heals people of all their ailments, and keeps them from growing old and dying.  Consider that a complete ripoff of the Star Trek episode \\"This Side of Paradise\\".<br /><br />These people, the Ba'ku, despite supposedly being in \\"utopia\\" and the sweet, pure, innocent, don't-say-Aryan innocents, show themselves to almost immediately be prejudiced, as when the crew confronts them, they point out Data, and say they don't want his kind among them, androids.<br /><br />The supposed \\"bad\\" guys, the Son'a, are not like that at all.  In fact, a pull-away shot from the don't-say-Aryan Ba'ku village shows a cloaked Federation observation post, featuring all the sorts of people the Ba'ku don't have---blacks!  Non-humans!  Minorities galore!  All working with the Son'a.<br /><br />But that undertone is one that is very subtle and subjective.<br /><br />The REAL problem with the film that completely cripples it involves the conflict at hand between these two.<br /><br />The Son'a are old as hell and dying, because of a reason revealed later in the film.  So they want to forcibly relocate the Ba'ku from their planet, so as to harvest the magic healy-stuff.  The Ba'ku refuse this, basically wanting no one to acquire this magic healy-stuff.<br /><br />All possible logic blows apart like so many Enterprise-D ass-portions.<br /><br />So Captain Picard and his crew decide to defend these don't-say-Aryan backwardass backwater arrogant arseholes because they don't want to share this incredibly revolution in medical technology with the galaxy?<br /><br />Here are some facts that only serve to drive a huge nail of frustration into your head as you bang your head on a wall at the sheer stupidity of the plot:<br /><br />- The Son'a are a FEDERATION MEMBER.<br />- The Son'a need this stuff to survive.  And since they are Federation members, they might be willing to, or be coerced into giving some of the healy-stuff to the scientists of the Federation to study and/or replicate in some way<br />- There are millions of Son'a and only SIX HUNDRED Ba'ku<br />- The Ba'ku will NOT let ANYONE harvest their magic healy-stuff, while they happily indulge in it and live for hundreds of years.<br /><br />The wall-banging stupidity reaches infrastructure-destroying proportions when Jean-Luc Picard DARES!  DARES!  DAAAARES!  to compare the attempted relocation of the Ba'ku to \\"past relocation events\\" in Earth history, undoubtedly making reference to the Native Americans.<br /><br />Native Americans: Millions of them, forcibly removed from their homelands and murdered wholesale, to sate the greed of the white men for natural resources and expansion of their land.  They suffered disease, starvation, freezing, and such events as genocide, the Trail of Tears, and exploitation and racism.  They now survive in a handful of thousands, with lots of land granted to tribes.<br /><br />Ba'ku: Only six hundred of them, forcibly removed from their homelands, and treated well by a benevolent and peaceful Federation, likely settled on a similar planet, where they would likely receive Federation membership and representation and supplies given to them if they so need them.  If the Son'a/Federation is successful in replicating this magic healy-stuff, the entire conflict will be for nothing, as the Ba'ku can continue living their lives of perfect utopia.<br /><br />Spock would be dead now, from slamminghis head into a wall from the sheer stupidity of this.<br /><br />At some point in the middle of the film, the screenwriters seem to remember, \\"Hay, wait a minute!  Teh Son'a are supposed to be the BAD GUYS!\\" and so out of butt-crack nowhere, the Son'a suddenly start screaming and wailing and behaving like irredeemable monsters, saying things like they don't care about Federation regulations, and would slaughter the entire Ba'ku race, and even having their leader murder a Federation Admiral who was previously helping them, just to make sure you're on the side of the hippie-liberal good guys like Picard and company.<br /><br />Out of NOWHERE does this sudden SWERVE take place, causing the inevitable \\"sidekick with a conscious\\" heel-face turn as he helps Picard to thwart the Son'a plot.<br /><br />On the plus side, character interactions are slightly better than in \\"Nemesis\\", and the political drama, when ignoring the sheer stupidity of the Enterprise's crew, seems tangible and full of potential.

B0012GMXLU|5.0|This release by motorhead is plenty of fuel and venom. This album is played with ferocious rhythm as typified by almost all tracks contained.  One more motorhead album that stands out in heavy metal world, this album is one of the greatest motorhead one.     This album carries on Fantastic songs with a range of paces but all strong. \\"I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care)\\" \\"No Voices In The Sky\\" \\"Going to Brazil\\"    That's a great job done by Lemmy and their guys. You should have it with your collection of fantastic heavy metal albums. A classical album I recommend to everybody.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I do NOT want 21st Century profanity and promiscuity in my Jane Austen/Regency Era cinema!    I agree with other reviewers that it was a good idea, but horrendously done.  All the original \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" characters are distorted, unrecognizable.  Why can't our time traveler meet characters that are true to the way Jane Austen described them?  And why do they all so easily accept Lizzy's absence?   And why would Darcy ever fall in love with such an unlikable woman?  I love Jane Austen.  I love science fiction, historical fiction, and especially time travel.  I love the idea of a 21st Century woman suddenly finding herself in a good Jane Austen/Regency Era plot.  This movie should have been a dream come true for me.  But it is apparently too much to ask for a dignified, likable 21st Century heroine.  For this reason I also hated the book \\"Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict.\\"  Am I wrong to think that most of us love Jane Austen novels because we want to immerse ourselves in the dignified behavior and dialogue?
B0000029DD|5.0|Have you ever been so inspired by someone, a song, event, place, performance and you couldn't explain it? Well that is exactly what happened to me the first weekend of Aug. of 2008.     I was online looking up some Leonard Cohen music to add to my ipod I went to [...] to see what I could find.     I typed in his name and a video of him performing Hallelujah came on. I had no idea that it was a Leonard Cohen song, I had always thought it was a Jeff Buckley song. I clicked on it, and had a chuckle it was a cheesy 70's performance but a beautiful song nonetheless.     Then I saw a video of Jeff Buckley performing Hallelujah live in Japan.     So I clicked on it an in that instant my life had changed. There is only him on the stage w/ his guitar and a mic.~ wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt (that is now so familiar of him wearing in his performances). The minute he opened his mouth to sing, I absolutely died. I had never heard anything like his voice before and I doubt I will ever again.     I just sat in my chair hypnotized by him, his voice which could've only been given to him as a gift personally from the angels in Heaven. Every note he sang and every chord he played on his guitar just washed over me. Everything about him permiated me. His voice, a voice from the angels ( a true belssing) his guitar playing his fingers playing each note just washed over me. I let the whole performamce so simple, passionate and pure washover me.     I had no idea what was happening to me. I had never been affected by anyone's music in my life EVER!! Each time I watched the video I took it all in, let it sink in. With each note sung with a voice which held tidal waves of vocal acrobatic bliss a fire was lit inside of me.     Something, a feeling, a connection, a hunger a need had been unearthed from the deepest reccess of my soul. In that moment his voice reached my ears it all exploded in a visceral fire bomb in my veins.     Create, create, create is now all I want to do. Any way possible~ dance, sing, paint, draw anything to feed this monster that he and his music that has uncaged inside of me.     After watching the video of that life changing performance for about the 10th time, (His face, mouth, fingers, eyes.   ) I had to find out WHO was/ is this man who posessed such a soul stealing, heart rushing voice?   Who is the man who can sing in such a way to affect me like this??     What I didn't understand was why? Is this affecting me now?? I had heard him sing Hallelujah many times, and ofcourse I loved it and I had/have it on my ipod.     I had always known who he was, I remember when he passed away. I was 18 or 17 and I saw it on MTV news. I thought it was sad and a loss of such great talent but it didn't really affect me beyond that.     Fastforward 11 years and now a song I had heard tons of times by a man who I knew of already had gotten under my skin.   Why and how could this affect me so deeply, now in my life??     I couldn't explain it?? What happened to me. How hungry I felt, how blessed I was to have found him and that particular performance. How uncomfortable and amazed I was that he had been able to reach me so many years after his passing (via youtube no less).     For a week afterwards i had been trying to figure out what was going on inside of me? How can I put it into words? How can I describe Jeff Buckley and his music to anyone?? I couldn't even do it in my own mind to myself.     Words started flashing in my mind to describe him-   Talented yes. Passionate yes. Beautiful yes. Blessed yes. Gifted yes. But these words were all too common to describe someone as uncommon and extraordinary as Jeff Buckley.     I had no way to pinpoint the words to describe what he stirred inside of me w/ his fierce ability to stand on a stage by himself and give so much of himself through just one performace.     Again words were flashing through my mind about how I was feeling~   Excited yes. Hungry yes. Amazed yes. But again words alltoo common to describe such unexplainable feelings that I hadn't felt in years.     I couldn't really think rationalize it in my mind, heart or soul until I started to think about how much music meant/means to me. This is the only explanation that I have been comfortable to give myself as well as others and I hope it is as clear to you as it is to me.     Music like like water to me, I need it to survive in no way am I musically inclined.     I But I love music, I have it in my life everyday like I said I need it to survive.     And do know the water in the Alps?? Or the water deep in the glaciers??   The water so pure, so sweet, so delicious? That is Jeff Buckley to me.     Jeff Buckley is the purest, sweetest, crispest water in nature The water so high in the mountains that no one can even imagine climbing that high to try and taste it     Jeff Buckley- his talent his everything is the water that is so deep in the glaciers that you or I or anyone else couldn't even begin to dig deep enough to reach its purity.     He is the water in nature that is so high up or deep down it is untouchable.   Jeff Buckley is the best water in the world!     ***Yes I am quite aware of the irony of this post***
B002JM1VJG|5.0|The video quality is on par with the how these videos were produced mostly back in the 80's and 90's and look better on this DVD than when they aired on broadcast TV. I'm running the sound through my stereo receiver and it sounds great. Glad I bought this collection and didn't listen to the bad reviews. Excellent collection of a music career spanning decades. If you're a Madonna fan, you will appreciate this collection. Not sure why the black censor bars show up in Justify My Love. This had to be a Corporate decision by Warner, but aren't most of Madonna fans all grown up now? The video is still pretty raunchy even with censorship. Remember MTV was mostly concerned with the video's \\"tone\\" than the content. Overall, this collection is like a love letter from Madge. Recommended.
B0025KVLTC|4.0|In my opinion, The Beatles \\"Revolver\\" offers up a thrilling and abit edgy follow up to \\"Rubber Soul\\" (which is one of my two favorite albums by the Fab Four). With a stand out track by George Harrison in \\"Taxman\\", the whole album knocks at your primal senses of anger, w/ \\"Taxman\\", fear/loneliness w/ \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", indulgence/laziness w/ \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and of course love w/ my favorite song of all time \\"Here There and Everywhere.\\"    Each song on this album is fresh, as well as a quintessential track by The Beatles. \\"Revolver\\" shows a deeper spiritual side to the historic band. This is Beautifully demonstrated in George Harrison's second offering on this album in the form of the  Middle Eastern influenced \\"Within You Without You\\". It is a short song but he sings of \\"making love all day long\\" in such a way that the listener actually believes he or she could do it!! (no matter what age he or she is).    And ofcourse the unforgettable classic \\"Yellow Submarine\\" written and performed by Ringo Starr. Having such prolific songwriters and John Lennon and Paul McCartney as bandmates it  can't be easy to write songs along side them.  Starr's song is a cheerful and optomistic fantasy song which balances the album perfectly.    All of the songs on \\"Revolver\\" are as equally pleasing to the ear as well as the soul.  I am aware that this album has been overlooked for many years. Being in a musical catalog with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" (Which is basically universally recognized as the epitome of music/of all types) and other gorgeous historical albums such as \\"The White Album\\", Abbey Road\\" and \\"A Hard Day's NIght\\" it is easier for \\"Revolver\\" to hide in the shadows of the other albums.    But to me it cries out to be listened to over and over. The Beatles defenitely created one of the most overlooked and understated musical albums w/ \\"Revolver\\". I urge listeners to put in this CD press play, and when it's over press play again.  And REPEAT!!
B0008KLVG4|1.0|I watched this film for the first time when I was 8 years old and that was in 1979. It was playing in a holiday resort cinema at the time. A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it. I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene. I had nightmares for weeks afterwards. Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time. There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious. The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way. A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids. I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound. I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film. But it is cool to see it digitally touched up. And what about the Score? Is there a more memorable score for a movie? Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world. That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better. I know it's strange but it's true. I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws. And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on. Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age. Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film. Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it. Big deal! Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself. In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.
0375842209|5.0|This book is so good I don't even know if I can do it justice in a review. It is as good as perfect. The narrative is tight, not a word too much. The plot glides smoothly forward, encorporating a wide range of issues, including first and foremost WWII in Germany, the meaning of parental love, friendship and loyalty, and the impact of sudden, violent death. It talks of sacrifice and risk, and growing up. The narrator is a very down to earth 'Death' without the black cloak, bag of bones image. This is death with compassion and a sense of humour.<br />It is a 'can't put down' read, of the like I haven't had in years. As all encompassing as War and Peace, but a lot easier to read!
1591840562|4.0|Great book, good condition, though it came without the cover which I was unhappy about
0743486285|2.0|Don't waste your time he is pathetic he also worries about his figure a bit much!! I bet he is bulimic not enough info out there about men with bulimia he should step up...
B000UGG39Q|5.0|The third of the Down albums, it is a mixture of rebuilding after personal tragedies with Hurricane Katrina and the loss of Dimebag Darrell (RIP). It is a lighter side of a once destructive sound. I believe it's better than the second for sure. Of course there's no touching the first album. Like others have said, \\"it's different, but still awesome.\\"  Being from Louisiana, I have to support my music.  I believe this album rocks. I hope there is more to come from Phil, Pepper, Kirk, Rex, and Jimmy.
0785787135|5.0|When I first started reading this story I wasn't sure what to make of it. As I got further in I realized it was truly a masterpiece. The characters are fully dimensional and the plot is intriguing. I love how Zimmerman made all the characters with both strengths and flaws, but her greatest achievement was retelling the story of King Arthur tale in a way that shows how every story has a different side - or several, than the \\"official\\" version.    I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I believe this new album from Alice in Chains is like a new beginning. We all miss Layne Staley's vocals, there is definately no replacing him. I believe releasing this album will help mend the heartache over their lost brother. And a rebirth of a new Alice in Chains will come...it may take some time to get use to, but I think this new line-up will go places. In some songs I feel that Duvall is trying to sound like Layne. And you can hear the old style guitar solos from Cantrell. I give this album 5-stars, I just wish the original band could have put out more albums.  The title track is very emotional, and you can hear it in Cantrell's voice. It truly is a wonderful tribute to Layne Staley.
B00014X8KO|4.0|For whatever reason, I ordered Memories but wasn't totally looking forward to seeing it after I got it in the mail.  But partway through Magnetic Rose, I knew I was crazy and should have watched it the night I got it.  I didn't know it was in Japanese with subtitles upon ordering (it's probably mentioned several times here, I just didn't pay attention to that) but I don't mind that.      Magnetic Rose seemed like an odd one to start out with, I probably would have made the order as Stink Bomb, Cannon Fodder, then Magnetic Rose.  Mostly because Magnetic Rose is a the best and effecting you emotionally.  It allowed enough time for an amount of character development, kept the pace up without feeling rushed, and managed a great atmosphere.  It's like an animated space-opera-horror type thing, but not horror in the conventional sense.  It might just be my imagination.  But either way thoroughly enjoyed it    Stink Bomb, to me, was like a catchy song in visual form with its constant forward motion.  The Japanese military's absurd antics to stop the chemist from bringing the toxin into Tokyo, and his absent-mindedly carrying the deadly gas all over the place.  It's just the right length, never lulls or bores, and doesn't try to be anything it's not.  The movie doesn't grab your shirt collar and whisper political agendas in your ear, as something with the plot could have done.  It's just a fun little animated romp.    Cannon Fodder's animation style kind of put me off, keeping me from enjoying it as much as I could have.  And although it had some interesting themes and a detailed world exposed in its short length, it didn't really get much done.  Not much actually happened in it.  Kind of a weak finisher to me, but still not bad.    Each given a star rating:  Magnetic Rose - *****  Stink Bomb - ****  Cannon Fodder - ***    All in all, a great package of three interesting anime shorts.  A worthy experience.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.  Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while \\"Home Alone 2\\" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.  You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.  The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche \\"You'll laugh, you'll cry\\" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.  I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is worth a thousand \\"Akira\\"s. And \\"Shrek\\"s. And, I'm willing to bet, \\"Treasure Planet\\"s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" - this is the real best picture of 1991.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|This film is amazing on many levels. Firstly, it is not simply a film about a serial killer but rather a film about both the public reaction to horror and the journalistic realm behind a killer's demands and desires. The cast is immaculate in their portrayal of the characters, with particular emphasis on gyllenhaal. If there's anything about these murders its the fact that the whole gruesomeness is shrouded in dark mysteries. The mystery concerning who the killer is, but mostly behind what the scenes were like ontological. Since the victims have no voice fincher had to use his artistry to communicate their story. Fincher captures these scenes and images with cinematic brilliance. His use of the interactions of the characters explains the ambiguous confusion that surrounds the manhunt for a subject such as this. This film is a must see for any criminology enthusiast or fincher fan. This is not another Seven or anything like that. It is its own animal. And man is the most dangerous game of them all.
B002KWLUU0|5.0|Soon as you listen to the first couple of tracks you realize how much you have missed Prefab Sprouts wonderful music.  This CD was never original released which is really hard to believe, but what a great surprise and treat it is to listen to some of best sounds out there.  Highly recommended.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I'll cut to the chase;  1. All Secrets Known 8/10 - Great guitar riff. Instrumentally awesome.  Vocally this song starts kind of flat.  A shame really but, picks up in intensity about half way through.  2. Check My Brain 9/10 - All around tune to crank all the way up. Good energy and intensity. Memorable opening guitar riff.   3. Last of My Kind 10/10 - IMO the best track on the album. Finally DuVall lets it rip.   4. Your Decision 7.5/10 - Good overall tune. Again the verse vocals are flat. Chorus vocals are great. Instrumentally very good   5. A Looking In View 9/10 - They need to add this tune to the periodic table it's so heavy and intense. Awesomely heavy and sinister.  6. When the Sun Rose Again 6/10 - Alice in Chains does Led Zeppelin. I hate this tune and I nearly threw the CD out the window after I heard this. 6/10 for only for trying something different.   7. Acid Bubble 9/10 - Ahhh just delightful and bizarre. Quality Alice in Chains.   8. Lesson Learned 5/10 - Sounds straight off Jerry's solo stuff. Doesn't belong on an AIC album.  9. Take Her Out 7/10 - This one is an oddity for me. Great guitar riffs and rhythm. Again verse is flat, but chorus is great.   10. Private Hell 7.5/10 - Stop with the morose sounding verses already. Great instrumentally. Chorus is fantastic.  11. Black Gives Way to Blue -/- No Comment  I love these guys, they are awesome. I am a fan of DuVall. Therefore out of respect, I did not sugar coat anything. I did not base or reference any old AIC material in this review. I was awaiting this album to see the direction that AIC was going. Overall I like the direction. The songs that hold this album up are;  Last of My Kind,  Check My Brain, A Looking In View,  Acid Bubble, and  All Secrets Known. If I had one thing to ask of the band it would be, where is DuVall's vocals on this album? I seen you guys at the Gourge in 2007 and you blew Velvet Revolver off the stage. DuVall has great intensity and pipes. If I had one bit of advice it would be, Jerry, you have a good voice but, limited. Give the mic to DuVall, let him rip, and you back him up. He has the vocal chops.
B000Y8GFY8|2.0|I am sorry to say that I simply did not undersatnd the concept or direction of this album in the least. Yeah, Goldfrapp generally rocks, but not on this CD. I've read the reviews of others and I came to enjoy Goldfrapp's work through similiar interests, but they completely lost me on this one.
037582913X|5.0|I read this to my children and then my grandchildren.  It's a book they want to hear again and again.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love supernatural but the set was displayed in a beautiful collectors edition box. Special features where also enjoyed. I love IT!!!
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|Comics would have to be some of the easiest stories to translate into film.  Many characters like Wolverine have a rich, incredibly complex history that can be drawn upon while the comics themselves present a visual storyboard.  But, Wolverine the movie is utterly hamstrung by a poor story line, shallow development of the characters, and very poor CGI for such a major movie.  I'm not a major Wolverine fanboy by any means, but from what I remember he is suppose to be a [...] killing machine.  I think in the previous X-Men movies, and particularly in this movie, the edge is taken off of Wolverine to his detriment.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I got this album from my cousin a couple months ago, and to be  honest, as a gift from him in memory there are some disadvantages.    Intro- 3 Stars, just an intro, nothing special.  Hot Dog- 3 stars, comical, because he says F... 48 times, but he is also making fun of NIN  My Generation- 5 stars, one of my favorites,very melodic and real metal!  Full Nelson- 4 stars, great anger song, but all that swearing and screaming wasn't needed.  My Way- 5 stars, very meaningful, and nice!  Rollin {Air Raid Vehicle} - 5 stars, has a beat, tempo, and makes you move! Thats Metal!  Livin It Up- 4 stars- The ''Life In The Fastlane'' thing was pointless, and weird lyrics, but good music!  The One- 4 stars, has a meaning and slow beat, but kinda soft, until the end.  Getcha Groove On- 2 stars, I'm not a big fan of Rap.  Take A Look Around- 5 stars, a classic, another favorite of mine!  It'll Be Ok- 5 stars, it has a meaning, beat, and really it should have been on their Greatest Hitz!  Boiler- 4 stars, describes my life, and the composition, at the start to middle is great, but horrible ending!  Hold On- 5 stars, beautiful, even with Scott Weiland, they made a nice song!  Rollin {Urban Assualt Vehicle}- 1 star, just a long, weird remix, to the original Rollin'.  Outro- 1 star, Garbage, has a sample of Intro and then nothing but 8 minutes of Fred & Ben laughing, for no reason!    I think this album had too many Interludes, and the lyrics to the songs were dealing with different topics, and had made a weird mix!
076535618X|4.0|Great storytelling, but less-than-stellar editing.  While neatly resolving all the interstellar crises, Scalzi seems to forget all about the intelligent \\"werewolves\\" introduced toward the middle of the book.  I really thought he was going somewhere with these creatures, but they just disappeared from the narrative.  In the acknowledgments, Scalzi credits his editors for helpfully ripping entire chapters out of the book.  Presumably, that's what happened to the werewolves.  I also saw more typos than I'm accustomed to in a finished book.    This is the first book I've read by Scalzi; I enjoyed it well enough that I'll pick up the earlier volumes, but I sense this book could have been better.  The four stars are for the story; for editing, I'd give it a two.
B001S33D1G|5.0|I don't care how creepy it is, I love this book.  This is supposed to be scary. There is a dangerous woman out there trying to harm Coraline and take her soul.  Coraline uses her wits to get her and her parents out of danger.  She doesn't use guns or magic.  She does this herself when no one else is there to help her.  She learns to take charge. In the end she discovers how wonderful her normal, boring life is.  Honestly I want my children to learn to be brave from a creepy book rather than find out that the world is not all gum drops and flowers from real life.  It's no different than telling kids not to walk home with strangers, or look both ways when crossing the street.    This book is clear, to the point, and imaginative.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|If you just like Michael Jackson's music and not him as an amazing character, you could just stick with CD or MP3. If you are a fan of Michael and you love everything about him, you absolutely want to collect this one. This video is a presentation that Michael is charming, powerful, loving, caring. You'd be stunned by how much his fans love him and why they love him so much.
B00288KNJU|4.0|Make sure you read the conditions of sale. It's a bit of a rip off if you don't live in the USA or Canada -- for some reason you don't get the digital copy.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|All Secrets Known introduces you to the new album Black Gives Way to Blue.  Check My Brain is an upbeat realization of years gone and heartache.  Last of My Kind is a badass song! It's right up their with Grind for me.   I hope they play this one live on their tour!  Your Decision is a cathardic mellow song.  The chorus gets to the core of the message in a relaxing Alice in Chains way that no other band could pull off.  Then, A Looking in View gets that dirty rock vibe pumping hard.  Turn your speakers up on this one! Black Gives Way to Blue ends the CD with a haunting brillance! It's a beautiful song with Elton John on piano. You'll want to play this one over and over again for sure.
B001FB55H6|3.0|The main feature is awesome but the extras are a little old for Watchmen fans. New viewers will enjoy them though.    A rip off if you don't live in the USA or Canada - you don't get the digital copy.    Yes, unbelievable huh? .. seems ridiculous that in 2009, there are geographical boundaries imposed on a technology that doesn't require anything location specific to work. Hello? It's \\"The Internet\\"
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The book was OK.  I keep reading Dan Brown hoping he'll come up with another Da Vinci Code, but The Lost Symbol was a disappointment.    Putting aside the light-weight story development for a moment, Brown's take on Freemasonry is whacked.  His interpretations of our symbols, the assertion that the 33rd degree is the highest degree, and other \\"facts\\" about the craft are just plain wrong.  This isn't like the Da Vinci Code in which the people who might have been able to prove or disprove Brown's assertions were long dead.  Instead, Brown could have spoken with one of millions of Freemasons who would have helped portray the fraternity correctly.    I should have know that the book was going to be a problem for me when the first thing I saw upon opening the book was a quote from \\"The Secret Teachings of All Ages.\\"  As an amateur masonic scholar, I've read that book.  I can tell you definitively that it falls short as an authoritative work on freemasonry.    Finally, I understand this is fiction.  However, too many people will believe what is in this book.  And although I give Brown credit for making a point of the undeserved bad press the fraternity has received over the years, I wish he would have spent a little more time with actual masons in good standing.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|What can you say about an HDMI cable? It is a cable ^_^ It either works or it doesn't work.<br /><br />This one works well, and it is clearly a well made cable. The cable arrived well packaged and protected from Amazon, and I was able to quickly open it up thanks to their \\"frustration free\\" packaging.<br /><br />The cable is SOLID. I mean that. It feels heavy, and thick, and WELL MADE when you hold it in your hands. Nothing flimsy about it at all. The heads are solidly protected by plastic covers when the cable arrives, and when you uncoil it, you can FEEL how solidly made it is.<br /><br />I tested the cable in two ways: with an XBOX 360, and with our DVD player. For the XBOX 360, I unplugged the current HDMI cable (a Belkin AM22302-06 6-Foot HDMI-to-HDMI Cable) from the XBOX 360, and plugged in the new cable in its place. Then I plugged the new cable into a free HDMI port on the TV (a Sony Bravia Z-Series KDL-46Z4100/B 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV), and there was an immediate picture with sound. It looked sharp, it carried the sound fine, and I could tell no noticeable difference between the old cable, and the new one -- other than how nice and solid the new one feels in my hand.<br /><br />So far, so good. Next I repeated the same procedure, this time with our DVD player (a Sony DVP-NC800H/S HDMI/CD Progressive Scan 5-Disc DVD Changer), which was using an identical HDMI cable as the XBOX 360 was. Same result. Immediate picture with sound.<br /><br />Overall, this is a simple product. It feels nice in your hand. It is clearly well made, and it works exactly the way it is supposed to.<br /><br />I was going to post pictures of it, but Amazon has already beaten me to the punch with every angle and take on the product which I thought of to photograph. (AGAIN! Not that I am complaining, mind you. ^_- I love it when a large amount of pictures from every angle are up on a product, that greatly aids in my buying decisions)<br /><br />Superior product, I went ahead and left it connected to the DVD player.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|From the second he explodes onto the stage until the he disappears into the night, Michael Jackson puts on a show that is spectacular.  You can feel the energy he puts into the music, the dancing and his connection to the audience.  No one will ever command the undivided attention of an audience the way Michael Jackson did as he performed.  He truly was a musical genius and a \\"one of a kind\\" man.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|I wonder what makes HDMI cables so costly.  Spending over fifty dollars seems ridiculous to me, so I've been waiting for a reasonably priced, high quality, flexible cable and I found exactly what I needed with the AmazonBasics Braided Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable at 6.5 feet!  Costing substantially less than comparable cables I've researched and held in my hands, this stands heads and shoulders above the others and I'm thrilled to now have my new HDTV hooked up to Cox Cable via this HDMI cable rather than the standard cables provided by the company.  Without an HDMI cable, I was not receiving the full options available but don't regret waiting to get this brand and model from Amazon; I would have spent far much more money to purchase another brand and it likely would not be as flexible and substantial as this.  My television is providing much more entertainment today than it was yesterday and the HD channels are overwhelmingly wonderful now!  Wish I'd utilized the HDMI capability sooner, but I'm happy to have this particular cable now and more money in the wallet for popcorn and beverages.<br /><br />The images provided by Amazon cover just about everything included with the exception of a little black twisty tie.  Nothing is wasted in this packaging, it can be reused or recycled and you do not need tools to access the cable from the packaging.  There is no chemical scent and you'll receive no cuts on the fingers from hard plastic packaging.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a longer braided cable, AmazonBasics also offers a 9.8 Feet model.
B000059T00|5.0|This was a short-lived, but sublime combination of rock greats and the label 'supergroup' for Blind Faith really does fit. It's as if these guys upped their game and their music became tighter. The compositions are excellent and Winword's vocals are beautiful and otherworldly. Listen, remember and enjoy!
0307269981|5.0|Each book gets better and better.  I love the title character and was pleased to see that this second volume in the trilogy really focused on her.  I did this one by audio and I couldn't stop listening the last 6 hrs. The ending is a real cliff hanger, though...can you wait until the next book comes out in the US???
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I have always liked Constantine. This is the second set I have bought. The first was worn out. The storyline is different and full of little twists. Keanu Reeves, does another stunning job of acting.<br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br />Cheers.............Shane (Australia)
0385504225|3.0|If you read the Da Vinci Code, you'll recognize the formula.  In a similar format, Brown takes us through a de-coding in DC.  Aside from some interesting factoids about our National symbols, there's only one \\"surprise\\" element.  The end of the book gets almost flag-waving and preachy.  He's written better and I hope he will again.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|It's a bit of a schlocky view of Australian history, more what the modern generation might have wished had happened. It's a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, part comic, part fantasy, part history. I never really felt Nicole Kidman's character, Lady Ashley, developed into a real person, she always remained a bit stock. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the movie and watched it twice in a row. The Aboriginal sub-plot, or maybe its the main plot, was fantastic, if not quite believable, but still quite beautiful.
B0018TNMC0|3.0|Great film , image as *** and sound *** (included castilian spanish) 22 days send to Spain
B001437DMA|5.0|The run of notes and melodies played with such depth is truly amazing on this work from Mr. Joe Satriani. I can only begin to imagine what lies ahead in Mr. Satriani's composing.    There is groove, there is heart, and there is thought on this masterpiece of virtuoso rock guitar CD. Mr. Satriani's catalog has very exceptional work. But this one is truly super impressive. Wow!
B00125WAXC|5.0|Showed this to a high school debate class. It really got the kids fired up about the passion the characters had for the art of debating. Another great acting role for Denzil Washington. I give this movie 5 stars for great entertainment.
1400096936|5.0|I wish I had started a scorecard on page one.  When the author is throwing so many characters at you you don't know which ones are important or just peripheral to the main protagonists.  I also didn't realize how much of the underpinnings of the story center on real life events and the political climate of the time.  It is also very hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  Or, should I say, the bad guys from the truly evil guys.  When each evil-doer has no qualms about double-tapping a friend or foe it is really hard to \\"bond\\" with any of them.  It was a little bit like the very violent stories of Charlie Houston. It was still a wild ride and I would highly recommend it.  I am now 100% against NAFTA and see what a futile attempt we are making to curtail the flow of drugs into the USA ... and why.  Is there no one who isn't corrupt?
B0000029DD|5.0|Ethereal, haunting, beautiful, grace-infused.....almost spiritual.  Those are the words I would use to describe Jeff Buckley's music.<br />I still remember the very first time I heard Jeff Buckley.... I literally stopped in my tracks because I was so transfixed by his voice and his music.  \\"Grace\\" is an absolute masterpiece:  each of the 10 songs is flawless.  I've worn out 2 copies of this CD and now have purchased my 3rd copy.<br />The ONLY negative thing I have to say about Buckley is that his star burned out way too soon due to his untimely death....  this one perfect diamond is all we'll ever have (other than the unfinished \\"sketches\\" which came later, and varioius live EP's, etc.)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of \\"Grace\\".  You'll be transported.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|I had been looking forward to Zombieland ever since I saw the first trailer a few months back. I knew going into the theater today that the vast majority of critics gave this film positive reviews, so it really seemed like this would have a little bit of something for everyone. As I expected, you get a bunch of laughs, inventive action scenes, gross-out gore and even a little romance for the ladies. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg have great chemistry and bounce off something a simple as a stare or line of dialogue with perfection. Woody must have been having a blast making this movie because it really shows in his performance. Eisenberg proves he has more range and is a better actor than Michael Cera, who he is always compared with because of the way he talks and the types of characters he plays. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin play the more serious half of the group of four, but they are likeable and make good additions to the zombie killing team. There is also a 5 minute cameo by a famous actor (which I won't spoil) that comes out of nowhere and leaves a very memorable impression. For a first time director, there is a really slick visual style that is captivating to watch. I loved the slow down/speed up camera shots, especially during the opening credits as Metallica's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" blares at full volume. The zombie makeup is very well done, the gore level is just right and you gotta love those rules Eisenberg's character makes up to survive. It was neat how they actually showed up in text on the screen when they were being used.<br /><br />I just so happened to have watched Shaun of the Dead again last night to get me in the zombie mindset. They are both comparable because of the common horror and comedy mixing, not to mention they both feature zombies, but Zombieland replaces the british humor with american humor. I'm not sure which one I like better as I've only seen this one for the first time. As of right now I'll give a slight edge to Shaun of the Dead. Neither is very scary, but they are fun rides from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and see this movie with a big crowd. This might be the most fun I've had at the movies since Drag Me to Hell came out in late May and believe me, I have seen a lot since then.ad. Neither is very scary, but they are fun rides from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and see this movie with a big crowd.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is amazing!  I would highly recommend the series on DVD so you can watch your favorite episodes over and over again.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This album is incredible!  Alter Bridge is like the second coming of rock.  They remind me of some of my favorite bands like Metallica, Guns n' Roses, Led Zeppelin, and Alice in Chains.  I absolutely love Myles Kennedy's voice and his vocal range is ridiculus (he is also an excellent guitar player)!  Mark, Brian, and Scott couldn't have found a better front man and they have created a great rock band!  I like One Day Remains but this one just brought the house down for me.  Every track is good in its own way.  My favorite tracks are Ties that bind, Before tomorrow comes, Rise Today, One by One, Watch over you, and White knuckles.  I have listened to this album so much that my cd has started skipping and I had to burn myself another one!  Thanks guys for showing us that real rock hasn't gone anywhere!
B002QN7PU2|5.0|Wow.  I don't have Showtime, but wish I did.  It's a facinating promo.  Not sure who to root for, the bad guy or the worse guys.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This album is incredible!  I have been a long time fan of Alice in Chains and I'm glad to have them back.  While I miss Layne, I feel that William really fits well with the band and he is an awesome singer/guitarist!  I bought this album the day it came out and I have already listened to it over 20 times and I just can't get enough.  My favorites are Black gives way to blue, Last of my kind, Your decision, and Private hell.  I think that all the true fans will love this album and will celebrate the second coming of AIC!  Real rock is back and here to stay!
140120841X|4.0|Well, the story is awasome. I got me into it even that I first saw the movie several years ago so I know some of the stuff, but still, the story manage to \\"hook\\" me into it.    However, as others said, the paper quality is pretty bad. The cover is ok but the pages... made the colors pretty bad. They seem faded away. It was hard for me to recongize some of the faces and the story turned a bit, strange for a while until I got the characters however I still feel confused about it.    This is the type of comic book everyone should have so you will really enjoy the story!
B0010KHOS0|1.0|i bay this one and until now i do not  see the dvd bacues the dvd cases  broken in insaid and the cover also not good ....<br />but ,. this the first time that the  amazon give me a bad one ...<br /><br />i hope this the last one ...
B0021L8UXU|4.0|\\"Zombieland\\", written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and directed by Ruben Fleischer.<br /><br />Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is an unlikely survivor of a zombie holocaust. Columbus has been able to do this by sticking to a set of strict rules that he has developed. Rules like, Cardio and always wearing a seatbelt (which we quickly learn why they are important). Columbus was going to college but after the zombie fallout has decided to cross the country to Columbus Ohio where his family resides or at least where he hopes they still reside. His path eventually crosses with that of Tallahassee, (Woody Harrelson) who is bound for Florida. The destinations set them on the same path for a while at least so although though out of character for both they decide to team up and of course both eventually linking up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and the Zombie slaying ensues...<br /><br />Zombieland was an enjoyable ride. There are no surprises here, this movie is basically what you are expecting which should be a fun ride with some laughs and they actually managed to squeeze some heart into to it as well.<br /><br />The Good: The movie was a fun watch with a lot laugh out loud moments. The writers managed to insert some interesting aspects like the characters names and how they come by them and the way Columbus's rules are incorporated into the film. There isn't a ton to elaborate on. It is just a fun watch.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: Don't go in looking for a life changing experience and you'll have fun. Check out Zombieland.
B0015AARJI|5.0|who has a PS3 needs this joystick is simply a necessity, very good and accurate and brings comfort to your hands when you're playing.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|I taped the audio off the Johnny Cash Show but those tapes have been packed away for years and probably not in very good shape, thus I was glad to have the dvd.  However, there are a few many artists no one ever heard of, and not enough of the ones I remember, like Mama Cass Elliott, who are missing from the dvd.  Overall quality is good and I liked John Carter Cash' narrative.  The price was very low for this dvd, I would think it would have sold for more, but because of the occasional artist no one ever heard of, it lowers the value of the product.  I also wish there had been more 'Ride This Train' segments - those were the highlight of the show for me.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|In October of 1992, Madonna had released her eigth album entitled, EROTICA. If any of you thought that \\"Justify My Love\\" showed Madonna going too far, sexually, then you all thought wrong. Wrong, indeed. EROTICA, or at least the album's title track, along with Madonna's SEX Book, and starring role in the 1992 erotic thriller, \\"Body Of Evidence\\", show Madonna going to the furthest point, sexually. But to me, it is no bother because this album is 100% pure brilliance.    EROTICA  The album's first single. What an awesome track. I cannot think of anything else to say that would describe how great, not to mention, dark, this song is. And I love it when there's darkness in a song.    FEVER  The album's fourth single, though, not released in the U.S. This is an awesome cover of the original Peggy Lee hit. In my opinion, Madonna's cover is so much better than Peggy Lee's original. True, Peggy Lee recorded it first and many people prefer originals, but I prefer Madonna's version, always.    BYE BYE BABY  The album's sixth & final single, though, not released in the U.S. Awesome song.    DEEPER AND DEEPER  The album's second single. This is one awesome song, with an amazing innovative music video.    WHERE LIFE BEGINS  This is an okay song.    BAD GIRL  The album's third single. The song's music video, to me, is one of Madonna's greatest. The story behind the whole video is just amazing. And Madonna looks absolutely gorgeous in the video. Not that she never looked beautiful.    WAITING  A great song.    THIEF OF HEARTS  A great song. A word of advice to all the women out there: Keep your paws off of Madonna's beau because she will slaughter you. LOL!!!!    WORDS  Another awesome song. Actions, in many ways, do speak louder than \\"Words\\", but \\"Words\\" still do hurt, at times.    RAIN  The album's fifth single. This song is simply beautiful. \\"Rain\\" is actually a song about Madonna's mother, and Karen Carpenter, who had sadly passed away, due to complications with anorexia.. Karen was the lead singer of The Carpenters, a recording duo that also featured Karen's brother, Richard. The Carpenters, to Madonna's claim, were one of Madonna's favorites, while growing up. This is such a beautiful song. The music video is another one of Madonna's greatest. The video was actually shot completely in black and white. Once the video was filmed, it was, then, hand-colored during the post-production process. It was said to have been done this way to make the video look more vibrant.    WHY'S IT SO HARD  What an awesome song. It does send out an outstanding point: \\"Why's it so hard to love on another?\\"    IN THIS LIFE  This beautiful song was written by Madonna, and is about two friends of Madonna's, who have both passed on due to AIDS, to which Madonna claims, \\"The greatest tragedy of the 20th century\\", during a concert in Sydney, Australia, during her \\"Girlie Show 1993 Tour\\".    DID YOU DO IT? (Remix of \\"Waiting\\") (performed by Madonna, Andre Bettis, Dave Murphy, & Mark Goodman)  This is a remix of waiting, with three rappers, by the names of Andre Bettis, Dave Murphy, and Mark Goodman, rapping to the entire remix, with Madonna's pre-recorded ad-libing vocals in the chorus. Horrible remix. If ain't broke, doin't fix it.    SECRET GARDEN  An okay song.    What an awesome album this one turned out to be. This album is very, very underrated and it should've gotten the credit and respected it so outstandingly deserves. If it weren't for the big-mouth, crap-for-brains critics, this album would've faired so much better. But, who cares? The opinions that truly matter are the opinions given by us Madonna fans, and EROTICA is one of Madonna's greatest pieces of work, and it will always be.
B000002JOH|5.0|This album did not debut at #1 as had been typed in some of the posts. Far Beyond Driven did that. I bought this album when I was in 8th grade and was floored by the heaviness. There is a unique mixture of groove, thrash, and hardcore, that many popular bands were not doing at the time. This is a must have for any metal fan. It's on my top 10 list for the greatest metal CDs of all time.
B000002LND|5.0|On November 13, 1990, Madonna released her seventh album entitled, THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. This would, obviously, be Madonna's first greatest hits compilation, and it is a great album. This album features 17 great songs, with the first fifteen songs being Madonna's greatest hits from 1983 to 1990, all remixed in Q-Sound, with the last two tracks being newly recorded songs. Read on.    HOLIDAY  From the 1983 album \\"Madonna\\". Still an absolute classic. I still say that Madonna's best performances of this song are featured on her \\"Blond Ambition 1990 Tour\\", \\"Girlie Show 1993 Tour\\", \\"Drowned World 2001 Tour\\", & \\"Re-Invention 2004 Tour\\".    LUCKY STAR  From the 1983 album \\"Madonna\\". Another timeless classic.    BORDERLINE  From the 1983 album \\"Madonna\\". Words cannot describe this great tune.    LIKE A VIRGIN  From the 1984 album \\"Like A Virgin\\". Still a classic that can still us all, as if it were \\"the very first time\\".    MATERIAL GIRL  From the 1984 album \\"Like A Virgin\\". Great song.    CRAZY FOR YOU  From the 1985 original motion picture & soundtrack \\"Vision Quest\\". Still a beautiful song, and I really enjoyed hearing Madonna perform this one on her \\"Re-Invention 2004 Tour\\".    INTO THE GROOVE  From the 1985 original motion picture \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\". Awesome song. A song that can still make us \\"Get Into The Groove\\".    LIVE TO TELL  From the 1986 album \\"True Blue\\". One of Madonna's most beautiful and heartfelt ballads. I get the chills everytime I hear this song.    PAPA DON'T PREACH  From the 1986 album \\"True Blue\\". Another great song. Loved Madonna's anti-abortion message here.    OPEN YOUR HEART  From the 1986 album \\"True Blue\\". Still one of my all-time favorites, for it was the song that turned me into the huge Madonna fan I am, today.    LA ISLA BONITA  From the 1986 album \\"True Blue\\". Who can resist this song? Honestly. Another one of Madonna's all-time greatest.    LIKE A PRAYER  From the 1989 album \\"Like A Prayer\\". They always say, \\"A true classicnever dies\\". They are right, indeed, for this song is a classic and a classic nevery dies.    EXPRESS YOURSELF  From the 1989 album \\"Like A Prayer\\". Another one of Madonna's timeless classics.    CHERISH  From the 1989 album \\"Like A Prayer\\". Awesome song.    VOGUE  From the     JUSTIFY MY LOVE  New song. The album's first single. It's obvious to us all that this song is about ... SEX. Madonna, in her videos and live performances, has given us a very sexual side of her. But all of her past antics from 1983 up to before this point have been child's play compared what she displayed in this song's music video, which is why MTV and VH1 had to ban this video from any airplay. Because of the video being banned, Sire Records & Warner Bros. Records released this music video on the first-ever VHS Single. No matter what those big-mouthed critics say, this is a great song, with an awesome, creative video. No one can do a video, like this, any better than Madonna can.    RESCUE ME  New song. The album's second & final single. This awesome song describes Madonna's want & need to have dominance in the world, despite the fact that most people view her as a freak.    As you can see, this album covers Madonna's greatest of hits from 1983 to 1990. My only qualm with this album is the fact that some of her big hits, from this point in her career, are missing. Those hits are: \\"Who's That Girl\\", \\"Causing A Commotion\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Everybody\\", \\"Burning Up\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"Oh Father\\", & \\"Hanky Panky\\". Sure, if those missing hits were added to this collection, the album would've been a full two discs long, but at least all of her hits would've been here. But, either way, this album is a huge gem to own, especially if you are an extreme die-hard Madonna fan.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Boston, 1770. John Adams is a successful lawyer who finds himself caught in a difficult position when he is asked to defend British soldiers accused of killing several civilians during a 'peaceful protest'. Since the protest was against Britain's increasing taxation of the colony whilst refusing it representation, the situation is inflammatory. Adams' sterling defence earns him a job offer from the colony's governor, which he turns down as King George III's policies towards the colonies become more repressive over the following few years. Adams is asked to help represent Massachusetts at the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania, where the debate quickly becomes centered on the question of full secession of the Thirteen Colonies from British control. With pro-British sentiment strong amongst some of the delegates, it falls to Adams and several unlikely allies, notably Dr. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, to push through the secession agreement and recruit Colonel George Washington to command the state militias. On 4 July 1776 the North American colonies declare independence from the British Empire, sparking the expansion of the armed struggle into a full-scale war.    Over the next fifty years, Adams continues to serve the fledgling nation. He serves as a delegate to the court of King Louis in pre-revolutionary Paris, as the United States' first peacetime ambassador to the hostile court of George III in London, as the first Vice-President of the United States and then as the second President during a time of great controversy as the country is divided over the matter of siding with Britain in war against France. Through it all Adams tries to steer a course of intellectual debate and mediation, but finds that his irascible temper and intellectual vanity makes him many and easy enemies at home and abroad. His relationship with Franklin and especially Jefferson changes over time, but he is constantly advised by his loyal and intelligent wife, Abigail, on matterspersonal and political.    John Adams is an epic HBO mini-series. In the course of seven hour-long episodes, it charts the birth of the United States and the role Adams (Paul Giamatti) played in its formative years, culminating in his retirement and the election of his son, John Quincy Adams, as the sixth President. The events are vast, incorporating the Revolutionary War, the French Revolution and the impact of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars on the USA's relations with both France and Britain (although the War of 1812 is not featured). Adams' various jobs are highlighted, from his not-so-humble beginnings as a skilled lawyer, his role in helping draft the Declaration of Independence to his tenure as Vice-President (where he becomes the first incumbent of the role to realise how powerless the position is) to his position as President, including being the first American head of state to live in the White House.    Adams the politician, lawyer and peacemaker form one side of the story, but his personal life forms the other. His wife Abigail (Laura Linney) is frequently separated from her husband as his job calls him to Philadelphia for long periods and, later, takes him to Europe for several years. Abigail's role as the home-maker, the raiser of their children (whose own travails form the series' major subplots) and her husband's constant advisor, either in person or by letter, lends an important emotional context to the drama. The creators of this series are as keen on the story of Adams the man as much as the historical figure, which is vital to hold the viewer's interest over the course of seven hours.    This is a talkative drama. With the exception of an engagement with a British frigate during his crossing to Paris and a later brush with illness in the Netherlands, Adams' life is not in jeopardy. The siege and battle for Boston is depicted briefly (helped by some superb CGI), but action elements are relatively light on the ground. The drama is fantastically acted by an A-grade cast acting at the top of their game and is superbly written. It is not completely historically accurate (lampshaded at one point when Adams rails against John Trumbull's famous painting, the Declaration of Independence, for being an artistic rather than literal interpretation of events) but the lengthy running time permits a much closer adherence to historical fact than say a two-hour movie would have. The only moment where the historical deviances seem incongruous is when Adams and Jefferson's strained relationship is repaired by Abigail's death and it is suggested they only have a brief period of reconciliation afterwards, whilst in reality they began corresponding six years before Abigail's passing and continued to do so until their own deaths eight years later. This feels a little too close to cheap sentiment, at odds with the deeper drama that makes up most of the mini-series.    Of course, the element I suspect most viewers will think is a ludicrous dramatic convenience is actually completely true: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died within a few hours of one another on the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence.    The actors are superb. Paul Giamatti plays Adams as irascible, arrogant, hot-tempered and prickly, but also a loving husband and father and deeply concerned for the well-being of his country. He is not always likable, but then neither was Adams. Laura Linney, who won an Emmy for her performance, is excellent as Abigail, portraying her as a strong and resolute woman occasionally resentful of her husband's long absences but also understanding of the magnitude of the times they are living in. Tom Wilkinson is likewise brilliant as the elderly Benjamin Franklin, whilst Stephen Dillane brings gravitas and intelligence to the role of Thomas Jefferson. If HBO ever do a companion series on the life of Jefferson, they should re-recruit Dillane immediately. Less well-served is Rufus Sewell, a tremendously skilled and capable actor, who is distinctly under-used as Alexander Hamilton and not given much of a deep character portrait. In addition, Tom Hollander has an excellent cameo as King George III, but plays him as if he's almost gone mad already, although his full descent into insanity did not begin until several years later. For the most part, the casting is exemplary.    John Adams (****½) is an epic, rich and gripping political and character drama, marred only by some minor acting and writing choices that don't entirely work. But, hinged on the superb performances of Giamatti, Linney, Wilkinson and Dillane, it is for the most part must-see TV.
0199571791|4.0|At a recent retirement dinner for Justice Albie Sachs of the South African Constitutional Court, one of his colleagues remarked that Sachs is universally known as \\"Albie,\\" even in the stuffy world of constitutional lawyers.  \\"Not many judges are instantly recognizable by their first names,\\" the speaker said.  \\"Albie is like Elvis.\\"     This book shows why.  Comprised of autobiographical snippets, reflections on judging, and excerpts from judicial opinions, the book's a lot like Sachs himself:   wise, funny, humane, eloquent, and committed to the project of building a new South Africa on the basis of respect for human dignity.  And, also like Sachs himself, it's loosely structured, underargued, and too uncritical of the role of heart and feeling in constitutional adjudication.  Sachs, after all, has a great heart and he feels deeply.  One suspects he made an essential contribution to the court's groundbreaking jurisprudence -- and that it was a good thing ten other judges also had votes.     In any event, Sachs is a hero, a gentleman, and a freedom fighter.  He made a huge personal sacrifice in the struggle to end apartheid.  He wears outrageous shirts on formal occasions.  And he's a thoughtful and compassionate judge.  All lawyers, law students, and students of jurisprudence should read his book.
0385504225|3.0|For about the first half of the book, I was hooked.  Even though I figured out the major plot twist, I was still fine with watching it unravel.  However, the last 1/3 of the book was a disappointment, and the ending was a real \\"huh?\\" moment for me.    I agree with another review that a lot of minute detail could have been left out without sacrificing character development and plot or story lines.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy for the same reason - endless droning on about pointless details.
1594488878|5.0|Reviewing Juliet, Naked, Nick Hornby's latest novel, almost seems wrong. The book, named after a fictional defunct rock star's newest album, discusses, as one of its themes, how people overanalyze things. How one song could mean the world to a fan, but is just a few well put together words to the musician. Because of that, my review seems almost pointless, going against the essence of the book. Come to think of it, so does my literature degree.     Regardless, I'm still going to write about it because, quite simply, I loved this book. Juliet, Naked is about Annie and Duncan, a stagnant couple that's been together for 15 years. Although Duncan might love Annie, he loves Tucker more. Tucker Crowe that is, a reclusive singer-songwriter from the 80's who stopped making music long ago. Duncan devoted his life to analyzing Tucker's work, digging into it's deepest meaning. Annie, not nearly as much as a fan, sits shotgun and is along for the ride, being simply content the entire time. Through a series of consequences Annie and Tucker exchange e-mails and a connection is formed as they both realize their major similarities - they are both incredibly lonely and worried that they wasted their lives away.     Being a long time fan of Hornby (who doesn't love his first three fiction novels?), my reaction to receiving an advanced copy of his newest novel was much like Duncan's in regards to Tucker's latest album - only lowered a few octaves mostly because I wasn't sure if it would be great. Admittedly, I didn't love A Long Way Down and thought Slam was a great young adult novel, but nothing extremely memorable (a reaction that seems to be universal, as it wasn't even listed as a previous written book). Juliet, Naked was incredibly surprising, though, in a way that made me scream \\"finally!\\"     Juliet, Naked infuses his ever present influence, music, with the ideas of love, loneliness, and the struggle to be something. The characters are drawn carefully as if the wrong wording could break them. Annie is a beautiful character - weak, yet stronger than she realizes, which makes her incredibly believable. She balances her relationship with Duncan, one that flatlined long ago, with the desire to make up for lost time with Tucker. She overanalyzes people and events in a way that brings out answers others wouldn't usually come across.     Duncan is that person everyone knows - that guy who knows too much about one subject and is too opinionated. He voices his ideas regarding Tucker's music as if what he says is fact. He's singleminded and pretentious, at times. Yet, as a character, he's endearing because he has no clue what he's doing.     Tucker, in my opinion, was the most interesting of the lot. The 50 plus musician doesn't put off the rock star appearance as many would assume (including myself - thinking he was somewhat like an 80's Russel Brand-this was more than likely because I was reading Brand's autobiographyat the same time). Instead, 20 years after his departure from music, he's a PTSA member, unemployed father of five - each from a different mother. He's full of flaws - a past that has a laundry list of conquests and mistakes. However, Hornby tells him in a way that's permissible - to the point that Tucker is more human than rock star.     The book shows what happens when you let your life happen without you. It shows how analyzing things, stripping them down until they're, so to say, naked doesn't always work out in life. And how not every story has a happy ending.    The book is incredibly well done. Infused with fake Wikipedia articles, e-mails, and message board messages, Hornby tells a tale of three lost individuals who find one another. And although they don't make one another's lives better instantly, there's that hope that it's not too late.
B000JLSM00|4.0|I have always loved John Wayne movies,and considered \\"The Searchers\\" to be one of the best.  My opinion of that remains unchanged, however, I didn't see much different between the standard DVD version and the blu ray version of this movie.  My TV, TV cables, and blu ray player are all top of the line and I have watched other blu ray discs on it and have been wowed by the detail and clarity.  This movie didn't really offer much more then the standard DVD version.  It's only priced a few more dollars above the standard DVD so its not that much of a risk and if you want the newest version of this movie, you will have it, but if you want to save a few bucks and get the same quality picture just go with the Standard DVD version.  I don't think this is anyone's fault, I just think that the movie technology of the 1950's doesn't convert well to Blu ray, but thats just one guys opinion.  Either way the movie is excellent.

B001C48EF6|5.0|There is a crisis in Britain, a king is nearing the end of his life, and the heir, a young girl barely 18 has been kept locked away by her mother and her mother's companion for years. Protected relentlessly against all possible ills, including the fear of falling down the stairs. Young Princess Victoria's life is one of incredible privelege and restriction. She has everything and nothing.    This film of just a few crucial years in her life is extraodinary. It covers the time just before her accession to the throne and all the pressures on her to name her mother (and so the companion) as regent for her. And following that the considerable pressures on her as a young inexperienced queen and political player who unwittingly ends up as a pawn in one ruthless but charming politician's game.    This is such a significant period in English history and in Victoria's life, as she travels from near complete isolation to the queen of England. All the responsibilities and choices she must make, the traps she could avoid and the ones she fell into. And into this strode Albert, the prince of a minor German principality, but the nephew of the ambitious and ruthless King of the Belgians.     The Extraodinary Emily Blunt plays Victoria beautifully. As a young repressed woman in a strait-jacket and later bursting out with fun, humour and intelliegence. The love affair growing between Albert and Victoria is neatly handled - how does the queen of England get to fall in love and why?     I just loved this movie, as I said, Emily Blunt is wonderful. Jim Broadbent is a convincing William IV and Rupert Friend almost gets there as Albert. Perhaps it is the character of Albert, who is very proper anyway which makes the role a tricky one. Either way it is a stunning cast. The costumes and make up excellent and the cinematography excellent.    A great story, well told, filmed and acted
0385504225|1.0|Buy this for your 8-year old if you like. But if your literary tastes go beyond that age don't bother. It is terrible---so bad I couldn't get beyond the first 200 pages. A total waste of time and money!!!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire, if not quite as riveting as The Hunger Games, comes in as a winning second installment in this most fascinating sci-fi trilogy.  The story picks up as heroine Katniss and her supposed boyfriend Peeta embark on the mandatory victory tour following their unprecedented two-person victory in the last annual fight-to-the-death contest known as the Hunger Games. A threatening message from the Captitol's diabolical President Snow and evidence of growing civil unrest in some of the twelve Districts, however, convince Katniss that her and Peeta's lives depend on their ability to continue posing as lovers and negating the Capitol's perception that they are catalysts for a coming rebellion.  Complicating things are Katniss's unrequited love for childhood friend Gale, and the irreconcilable conflict between her desire to fight back against the Capitol on the one hand and her obligation to protect Peeta, her friends and family on the other.  Things really heat up when the rules for the seventy-fifth Hunger Games are announced, making it inevitable that Katniss and the past victors from the other Districts will be summoned to the arena one more time.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins continues to display a mastery for placing Katniss in heart-and-mind-rending ethical dilemmas, and, except for a few slower chapters in the middle, manages to sustain the same high suspense that made the The Hunger Games so compelling.  The clear, unadorned writing style, while accessable to teens, is sophisticated enough for older readers.  As proven by Harry Potter, the ability to connect with such as wide audience is a winning formula.  And this trilogy has the creative post-apocalyptic setting, likeable characters, and intellectual substance to make it a worthy candidate for a movie franchise and legion of devoted fans of all ages.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The initial mix down for a Beatles album was always in mono. The stereo mixes were usually made a few days later. This usually lead to the surprising fact that, if you had both the mono and stereo copies of a Beatles album, you could discover considerable differences in the songs. Now finally with this Beatles in Mono box set, you can do all the comparing properly if you also have the Beatles Stereo Box Set. The three final Beatles albums are not included in this mono box set, since those albums were never mixed in mono. I think that's a bold move, but still: the true aficionados will only appreciate it. Another interesting thing here, is that the mono discs of Help and Rubber Soul also contain the original 1965 stereo mix downs as an extra. That already is a good reason to get this mono box set, since the stereo versions of those two albums on the stereo box set were remixed by George Martin in 1986 for their first CD release. In other words: with the mono and stereo box set, you have everything together, nicely arranged and annotated in two beautiful boxes. Especially for those who have no Beatles CDs whatsoever these boxes are a superb solution. The mono discs come in beautiful miniature album covers and even contain a real mini record sleeve inside! The mono box set and all the CDs are made in Japan by the way; maybe because the Japanese are known for that kind of reissues on CD. Go get it folks, you will spend hours listening, reading and comparing everything to the stereo box set. It's fun!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Mostly great album, I have listened constantly since I got it.   I believe the new singer does Layne justice, and also agree that it does sound very similar to Jerry Cantrell's solo work.   The overall tone of the album is much more akin to Jar of Flies than other albums in my opinion.   The band tastefully added William DuVall years before recording this cd to be sure that he is an honorable fit.   And fit in he does, not as replacement, but as an addition to the band. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B00005JXY3|5.0|Daniel Larusso travels with Mr. Miagi to Oki Nawa in Japan in order to check on his father, who is very ill. When they return, they are received by Sato, who wants to fight with Mr. Miago in order to defend his honor. He got dishonoured when Miyagi fell in live with his girlfriend before he decided to escape to the US. On the other side, his nephew Chozan is bullying Daniel all the time. He is such a great Karate fighter.    Great movie!     I like it because it represents the real purpose of Karate, which is self defence.   There are no tournaments to compete in. It's about surviving.  The only thing I think could have been done to improve the movie was to give Daniel actual Karate lessons before making this movie. His moves are not convincing at all. They are weak and incorrect sometimes. People who do martial arts could immediately recognize the flaws in his techniques. Johny from Part 1 and Chozan from Part II are way better than him, in which Daniel surprisingly still managed to defeat them.    Anyway, the Karate Kid could easily be one of the best movies of our times.

B000I5Y8XM|4.0|After the electronic, New Age \\"Two Horizons,\\" it was nice to see Moya return to a more acoustic sound. This album, telling about the good and the bad in her life, is very beautiful. The acoustic sound fits perfectly and adds to the personal emotion that I believe the artist meant to convey.    Highlights include: \\"Purple Haze,\\" \\"Merry-go-round,\\" \\"Always,\\" \\"Black Night,\\" \\"Many Faces,\\" \\"Hear My Prayer,\\" and \\"I Will Find You\\" (a lovely cover of Clannad's theme for \\"Last of the Mohicans, which Moya sang in years ago). If you enjoy Clannad and Moya Brennan, this album is definitely for you.

B001R60ESE|3.0|The conert itself was very good.  He's extremely gifted, has an amazing backup group and the Boston Symphony is great.   His guests were outstanding for the most part.  There were a couple of performers that I never heard of but they were very good singers.  What did not impress me was the audio on the blu ray.  My Denon did not pick up and type of DTS sound or surround sound so what I listened to in my home theatre room was stereo.  If I'm dishing out bucks for blu ray, I expect some type of better digi sound than stereo.  I want all of my speakers to roar.  The sound clarity was very good though.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown has run out of gas or rather he has run out of writers to plagarize as he did in The DaVinci Code where he took Holy Blood, Holy Grail almost verbatim and breathlessly exposed each of its' revelations as his own. While I thoroughly enjoyed that effort, this one leaves me cold. The plot is like a \\"Mad Lib\\". All the elements of DaVinci Code are present; the names and places are changed. We waited how many years for this?
B000002GFC|4.0|Of course big time fans always own all the studio albums don't they? And then they go out and buy a best of at some point or three as well because they are sad individuals. Trust me on this - I have a stack of bands where I have the entire catalogue and then buy a best of! Why do I do it! That's right, cos I'm a sad individual....<br /><br />But for the average music lover, flower power gen person, student of the guitar and whatever other personality types are attracted to checking out Cream this is probably as good a place to start as any to check out one of the bands who plugged in and played loud back in the days before decent sound technology. Hugely respected, hugely successful and a great synergy of musical talents Cream are way worth a best of buy. For the two uninitiated people ever likely to read this review the CD at hand collects a wad of wattage by this 60's band of British invasion blues devotees and the tracks run the gamut from straight ahead rockers like the ubiquitous Sunshine Of Your Love to the more obtuse lyrically Strange Brew White Room (I think they call them - whisper it - mind expanding substances) and down to more funked up numbers like Politician.<br /><br />Credits for each track are included as are concise liner notes - which everyone said would die with the CD age. And these tracks have been remastered and they sound lovely and spring fresh. To tell the truth this disc pretty much contains the bands entire canon and showcases their talents and their influences. Certainly a better buy than The Cream of Eric Clapton in my opinion and given the price you can score it for there is really no excuse for any casual listener to not pick up this handy twenty track compilation.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Brand New Eyes is absolutely amazing. I honestly have no idea why people aren't satisfied by their fine work. Paramore has evolved tremendously in these past years and it definitely shows in this album. People don't seem to understand the hardships of a band and this is their way of telling it. The whole ride includes love, heartbreak, and friendship. Plus add the pressure of satisfying their fans.     Looking at this album I wasn't exactly sure how well they would do since by the third album bands just seem to disappoint because they try to play it safe or over do it, this is always the fallout album for an artist or band. Of course they always make a comeback.     Yet Brand New Eyes is far from a letdown. Yes, I can say the sound did kind of change but I find it intriguing and still the same Paramore we all know and love. I mean, come on, we'd get bored by the same sound and as I recall people complained at how the sound in Riot! was plain and played safe.     That's not the case here. Paramore pushed the limits and anybody can see that. Turn It Off is a big favorite of mine that anyone cane relate to. In Misguided Ghosts Hayley sounds like Regina Spektor. Another favorite of mine in Brick By Boring Brick. It explains how you have to face reality and not just ignore it. I think everyone can relate to that.     I'm extremely pleased by this album. This teenager is very happy! [too lazy to log into my own] :)

B001993Y2C|3.0|What I didn't need: A Cylon Centurion action figure.    What I did need: some kind of index for episodes and extras and a better way to store the discs.    I'm going to echo what a lot of reviewers have already said by way of reinforcing their point that the packaging is severely lacking. The absence of any kind of index for the content really complicates getting at the stuff you'd be interested in seeing (or even having a convenient way to remember where you left off). Menus leave a bit to be desired and the sleeves are a terrible way to store a disc (beyond being unsuitable for protecting the discs' surfaces, it can be difficult to get the discs out of the sleeves).    None of these things are deal breakers, but they are frustrating to the point that I would consider buying seasons individually if I had it to do over again.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This CD contains some of Mike Bloomfield's guitar hero work.  He was the BEST white blues guitarist of all time (with Peter Green being a very, very close 2nd).  When Bloomfield was 'on' no one could touch his playing.
B000R7GKQE|1.0|I gave this only one star not because of the show (which is fantastic) but because of the problems that many people have had with disc one. I ordered two sets from amazon and I bought one set from Best Buy with the same result. I was finally able to figure out that disc one will only play on non-blu-ray machines (at least it won't play on my particular blu-ray player, which is a sony BDP-BX1). Fortunately, I kept my old sony player and was able to watch disc 1.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|Hot on the heels of the brilliant 'Casino Royale,' 'Quantum of Solace' starts immediately after the finale scenes of CR, a first for Bond films, and it's instantly noticeable that this was made by another director. CR was masterfully shot. Camera movement, angles, long shots, it harked back to an older style of action visual filmmaking with a new-school inspiration. QOS is all new-school. As if he went to the Paul Greengrass school of camerawork, Marc Forrester shoots the action with the shaky-cam, closeps galore, ultra-fast cutting of the Bourne films. Hey he even hired the Bourne series' 2nd unit Director! This hurts the film. Bond is not supposed to be Bourne. Yes the Bond films have and should adapt to the current time period, but this is what made CR look and feel so great. A current film with an updated scenario, shot in the wonderful older style of holding on action so you can be amazed at what you actually SEE, as opposed to cutting ON the action.    As for the film itself, a letdown. This was supposed to be the 'Dark Knight' to CR's 'Batman Begins.' No way. QOS is completely less-involving, doesn't develop Bond as a character, and things just have no strong meaning! Yes thats sounds dumb,but in CR everything that happened MEANT something to Bond and who he is to become. This film just follows along as he kills people for no good reason, and goes after another standard (although well acted) villain. Like so many other Bond films, a solid story is second to action set pieces. Doesn't make it a bad film, just not nearly as good as CR.    The blu-ray itself is also a letdown. The lack of special features makes it plainly obvious that Sony is going to try and milk the consumer for all he/she is worth with an eventual double-dip when the next Bond film comes to theatres. Sound and picture quality are solid at least, but the rest is almost bare-bones compared to every other Bond film released on blu.    A run of the mill, but at least very entertaining Bond film.Up there with 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and 'Thunderball.'

He does not sell the book to the highest bidder. Instead he adds them to his collection and files them away in his heart. Soon his obsession overcomes him in a possessive nature. He must have them all!<br /><br />Ken is book dealer who also has a talent for putting together clues. He sets his sights on John and his precious book collection. Who will come out on top?<br /><br />This is a must read for any book lover. It has a little bit of everything - mystery, suspense and it's wickedly funny. It almost makes me want to stop blogging and hunt down some rare books of my own. Luckily I have a wild imagination, so hunting down rare books actually means cracking this book open and reading it again.
B002HNA95E|5.0|This Madonna 2 disc collection is the best thing for me.  I have read mixed reviews here and it seems no one actually thinks the collection is bad but the issue is rather the number of collections she has already released and that this one is not all encompassing of her career.  I am a casual listener of Madonna.  I was a hurge fan early in her career and then around the time of EROTICA I wandered away and stopped buying her albums.  When I saw this new 2 cd collection I thought what a great way for me to see how I feel about how Madonna has evolved over the decades.  So I listened to the 30 second samples of each song and became very intrigued.  I had to have it.<br /><br />I found myself totally in awe from the first song HUNG UP till the end with CELEBRATION.  We basically have 2 1/2 hours of musc here and for this casual Madonna listener it is pure joy.  I have my early favorites BORDERLINE, HOLIDAY, CRAZY FOR YOU and LIKE A VIRGIN that were necessities in order for me to purchase it.  I am not always a huge fan of techno music or extended dance tracks but what I must say immediately about Madonna is that her music all has a depth and quality that is timeless.  I love the mix of techno, dance, pop and ballads and love all the versions included here.  I never get bored and also love the order of the tracks.  The songs are not in the order of release but there must be some form of magic to its madness that works amazingly well.  To go from the later song DON'T TELL ME and to have it smoothly go into the early CHERISH shows how Madonna has always had the magic.<br /><br />I am giving this collection a huge 5 star rating for my enjoyment of it.  I totally understand the frustration of those Madonna followers who have every album, even the hits collections and see this as yet another one.  It seems to be a consensus that it is lacking many necessary tracks so it is not a career all inclusive set.  Luckily for me since I strayed away from Madonna for a while all this is new and awesome to me plus my early career favorites are here.  I think all will agree with the detail put into the packaging with the enclosed posters and very unique design.  Also the digital remastering of all the tracks is superb.  For me this is a huge welcome back to Madonna and catching me up on how much she has grown.<br /><br />Favorite tracks for me are MUSIC, VOGUE, INTO THE GROOVE, SORRY, EXPRESS YOURSELF, REVOLVER, 4 MINUTES, FROZEN, TAKE A BOW and HOLLYWOOD.  For me this whole collection flows effortlessly from beginning to end with the extended mixes, shorter tracks and songs of the more pop/ballad genre blending together with perfect cohesion.

B0013USZHG|5.0|I just watched this performance on Ovation TV, and was extremely impressed with the music selections and the quality of the performance.  It was very invigorating and a real joy to watch.  The sights and sounds grabbed my two-year old daughter, and she could not sit still nor take her eyes off the TV during the entire program.  I recorded it so that I can watch it again, but I will definitely purchase the DVD for the improved sound quality with my Surround Sound System.  I highly recommend this program!

B00006BIO0|5.0|ive been listening to patton for years, and this collection is one the best 5cd collections ever made,  and let me point out the voice throwing blues,, one the best songs ive ever heard,, its not patton singing, but whoever it is, its great, he does half regular voice, and the other half sounds like hes singing through a megaphone,, its the coolest thing ive ever heard on a pre ww2 track,  it sounds like hes singing through some ancient effect box(and i love effects!!)
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I must only append a few details to the volume that has been spoken already for this album--I hope that they may serve as neat little insights for listener to the album.    One of the things that makes this album so wonderful is the almost-unreal organ-synthy sounds that bracket its beginning and end (think the great part in In the Flowers, and a similar thing that comes in at the interlude of Brothersport), with a sound almost like heavenly chorus of icicles and grasshoppers (if you really listen to it, you'll know what I mean).    The other thing I truly love about this album:  it feels, simply, like an affirmation of what's truly good in the world.  It's beautiful.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I ordered the DVD of Supernatural just before the pre-order finished. The price was fantastic!! With the DVD and postage toNew Zealand it was a total of around $70 (NZ), which would be around the price of the DVD only in the shops. The service of getting the item delivered was outstanding and I basically recieved the item a week later. The is extremly fabtastic as i was from the USA and would normally take longer!
B000008HA0|5.0|Maybe it's just me, but Space Shanty sounds WAY ahead of its time.  By that I mean, it sounds like it stands apart drastically compared to every other band in the early 70's.      The wavy guitar lines are really beautiful and believable the way they capture the adventurous feeling of being lost out in outerspace (the pleasant vibes of outerspace I mean, not the \\"forever drifting away\\" part, which is terrifying!)  These guys are REALLY good at it, and it's a shame this is the only album Khan released.  I'm sitting here totally amazed more people aren't finding this album fascinating in the same way I am.  The vocal melodies are glorious and sparkle with clean, splendid production.  This album sure doesn't sound like early 70's rock to me.  The way it was recorded just blows me away.    I don't like Space Shanty as much as all those druggy, spaced-out mid 70's Gong albums (which are truly original) but it's honestly not THAT much worse.  I don't even think Khan should be compared to Gong because the two bands sound so much different from each other.       Space Shanty can best be summed up like this- *this* is what happens when Pink Floyd and Caravan blend together.  It's sort of like progressive rock, but in another way, it's more about spaced out atmospheric rock but with actual song structure and melody.  The keyboards, guitar playing, everything about Space Shanty screams quality performance.  This album *is* on the same level as many Gong classics in my opinion.  Excellent!

B001DU8T6S|3.0|Well, not really, but there are times when we you hear echoes of the band. Paul Rogers is an incredible singer and sounds just as good as ever, and on songs like \\"We Believe,\\" and \\"Through The Night,\\" May lets his guitar soar in a way that will have you recalling past triumphs. \\"Call Me\\" hearkens back to the harmonies that Queen was synonymous with but the overall effect is a bit of a patchwork of  with over the top political anthems like \\"Warboys\\" or Rogers-style rock ballads with Queen overtones like \\"Still Burnin.\\" I liked it and got a great kick out of \\"C-lebrity\\" especially the line \\"I gotta tell the world that may say I'm dumb...But um\\" which made me laugh the first time out and still puts a smile on my face. Maybe it's really Rogers, Taylor and May but it is fun and worth a listen.
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol was another one of Dan Brown's page turners The ending, however, was flat and disappointing.  The villains identity was a shocker.

6302181569|1.0|All the other reviewers were perhaps too upset about the image quality, to note that *gee* this story is long on technology exposition, free of character, and story telling cohesion.  This movie stinks.  Who in their right mind would recommend this movie to another sentient being?   1. It's so god awfully boring. Most of the movie is Walter Pidgen explaining outrageous(not really) technology in a professorial monotone in a single camera shot.  Apparently they spent all their money making Robbie the Robot's gyroscopes motorized instead of hiring a director with even a kindergartener's understanding of composition. Also the director really wants you to get how amazing techonology is! Even it means this movie crawls at a snail's pace unrelieved by true wonder, or a glimpse of an alien tentacle.  See the five minute shot of the flying saucer's landing gear- an homage to a stainless steel column stool a la a fifties diner.  2. The first third of this movie is a nerds-only sex farce wherein various corn-pone nineteen fifties types try to teach Virgin Anne Francis how to kiss. Anne Francis on the other hand is too busy taming the inexplicable tigers that roam planet Altair with her Virgin powers. That or the space cook trying to get Robbie the Robot to make him up some Kentucky Bourbon.   And then suddenly this drops and Anne Francis doesn't say another line until the last five minutes of the movie. Because Walter Pidgen has to come back on and do more exposition the wonders of Krell technology, a long dead alien race we haven't glimpsed or known about until the second act.   3. Just in case you weren't going gaga over the blinking lights, and far-out techno sounds that accompany them *don't worry* there is a big ole monster that comes along. Again due to budgetery concerns this monster is INVISIBLE. We do however get to see a vewy scawy plaster cast of a claw.    Were this a Star Trek episode, it'd be succinct and succulent.  Instead the only thing worth seeing in this movie is Walter Pidgen's totally swank Jetson's pad, Anne Francis's perky little bod, and Leslie Nielson when he had brown hair.  Apparently it inspired Star Trek which is perhaps the only reason in a million years you might want to watch this forgettable trash.

The parents named Diane and Steve (JoBeth Williams and Craig T.Nelson) are skeptical about the odd behavior going on at the house such as chairs moving by themselves, lights turning on and off on their own and plenty of other weird things, even the son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and teenage daughter Dana (Dominque Dunne) are weirded out by strange things in the house. It seems the house does have secrets from the past left untold including being near the cemetery as these ghosts seem friendly and playful at first. Later it turns out they abduct little Carol Ann into a vortex inside the house trapping her in as they purposely terrorize the family. They hire some paranormal experts (Beatrice Straight, Martin Casella and Richard Lawson) including a dwarfish psychic named Tagina (Zelda Rubinstein) to bring her back and clean the house of spirits.<br /><br />Terrifying and original supernatural horror drama from writer-producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.

1423101499|5.0|Rick Riordan's five-book \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series arrives at its penultimate installment with \\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\\".  In many ways, I would say that this is my favourite part of the series, although both the preceding one (\\"The Titan's Curse\\") and the subsequent conclusion (\\"The Last Olympian\\").  With the Titan Lord Kronos on the rise, our heroes continue their frantic quest to abort his rebirth.  The book is discussed in some detail below, so spoilers.    As might be divined from the title, the book involves the legendary labyrinth of Minos, which, we learn, has continued to expand over time, and is located below the United States.  After spending most of \\"The Titan's Curse\\" off-screen, Annabeth Chase (a daughter of Athena; the seeming contradiction between this and Athena's mythical vow of chastity is finally explained here, in a way that makes for a clever pun) is back centre-stage.  Every novel so far has had a character get a quest (Percy in #1, Clarisse in #2, #3 is I suppose arguable, but Zoe Nightshade fits), and now it's Annabeth's turn (though, of course, Percy is the main character).  Also returning to some prominence is Tyson, Percy's Cyclops half-brother, who only cameo'd in the previous installment.    One of the regular features of the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series is the rotating spotlight on the fourteen Olympian Gods (the number is frequently given as Twelve, but that ignores Hestia and Hades).  In this one, Hera and Hephaestus get their turns.  Hephaestus, the tech-guy of the mythos, gets a few good scenes; Hera is well-written, but hers is probably the least-flattering depiction in the series (even bellicose Ares, who tries to kill the main character a couple of times, comes off better for his lack of pretensions).  Themes of family and how these are reconciled with the immortal gods are explored with these two.    This book contains what is perhaps the single-strongest chapter, \\"I Take A Permanent Vacation\\" (the series' charmingly blunt chapter titles continue), where Percy finds himself visiting the island of Calypso.  Beautifully-written and extremely sad, Riordan demonstrates tremendous writing skill.  This is nearly matched by an impressive moment where Grover the satyr finally fulfills his lifelong ambition: locating the God of the Wild, Pan.  The explanation for why Pan departed and what must happen next is superb, and one of the best-handled environmentalist allegories I've read in a while.    The tangle of teenage relationships that Riordan has slowly cultivated over the course of the previous three books continues here.  Percy and Annabeth's blossoming attraction becomes more and more obvious.  Riordan throws in a major complication (one he set up last book) in the form of Rachel Elizabeth Dare (for whatever reason, her full name is constantly repeated; once a book would have been enough, Rick), who causes Annabeth to show a different side of herself (catty jealous girl).  But one imagines those crazy kids will work things out in the end.    Highly recommended.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Great action film with a couple slices of humanity thrown in. Christian Bale gives a great performance as John Preston, a secret policeman working for a emotion-banning totalitarian government. His job is to kill anyone who skips their daily dose of fluid that takes away all sensation, emotional and physical; but when Preston neglects to take the sense eradicating medicine, he begins to experience feelings and sensations... and doesn't want to let them go.<br /><br />It is really heart warming to see Bale take his character from a calculated killer to a determined freedom fighter, especially during the puppy and sunrise scenes. His resolve to destroy the government that has denied everyone emotional freedom is powerful, and as a result the gunfight scenes are pretty satisfying.<br /><br />The only peeve I have with Equilibrium is it's rushed climax; the main bad guys are defeated far too easily. Also, the special effects look a little dated for 2002 standards, but Bale's acting and the fight scenes more than make up for it. Aside from that, this film is a solid action/thriller in the vein of 1984 and V for Vendetta. Rent it!

B001DTPZNY|4.0|I went into this movie worrying about several things: First, will it be as bad as the detractors are saying? Is it still an Indy movie? Will Shia LaBeouf take Willie's spot as the most annoying sidekick in the Indy series?<br /><br />Thankfully, I found that I really enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's no Raiders or Last Crusade, but why would anyone want the same movie all over again? No, Crystal Skull is a different breed of Indy film. As the great Bob Dylan sings, \\"the times they are a changin'\\" and that idea fits here well. Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg work well together making Indy's age a factor in the movie, but not one that takes all of the attention. Shia LaBeouf is more tolerable as the tenacious Mutt than his character in Transformers, and Cate Blanchett and Karen Allen provide solid performances.<br /><br />The story is not as clogged and confusing as the film's detractors are saying; in fact, it's rather easy to follow. It's pretty entertaining and makes the 2 hours plus seem a lot less, a sign of good storytelling since no part of Crystal Skull really felt slow or dragging. The whole alien/Soviet concept is not as unbelievable as one might think; in fact, it works rather well and breathes new life into the franchise. Sure, it's a bit different than the usual crusty tomb full of treasure or shrines to strange gods, but that's what is so appealing about this movie; it takes Indy in a new direction while not straying from the pulp lifeblood that flows through the series' veins.<br /><br />Disregard all the hatred toward this film, go see it and form your own opinion. If you want Raiders 2, then just watch Raiders. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a NEW Indy movie, therefore it's not going to be the same as the original three. On that note, if this had been a carbon copy of Raiders, there would be a bunch of people complaining that Lucas and Spielberg are too afraid to move the franchise forward or some nonsense. Go see it with an open mind and expect a new Indiana Jones, not a rehash, and you shouldn't be disappointed.nd expect a new Indiana Jones, not a rehash, and you shouldn't be disappointed.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|In 2005, it came as a surprise for some when the band regrouped for a benefit show and later reunion dates, later recruiting new vocalist/guitarist William DuVall (replacing the late Layne Staley, who passed away in 2002), but would not work on new music until 2007. 2009, we have the band's fourth full length album Black Gives Way To Blue. Okay, here's a couple of things I need to say right here: whatever feelings you may have for the band right now, if you're one of those that feel the band simply can't do it without Layne, you need to set your feelings aside and give this album a shot. If you're a fan, you'll very likely enjoy listening to this. William DuVall is a worthy replacement especially when performing older songs live. Second, some people feel that the music sounds more like Jerry Cantrell's solo material. Well, his music has often been compared to AIC, Sean Kinney (drums) and Mike Inez (bass) both played on his debut album Boggy Depot. After all, Jerry is one of the main song writers for the band. I feel that it wouldn't be AIC without Jerry just as much as somebody feeling that it wouldn't be them without Layne. So, it may be easy to confuse the new AIC music with Cantrell's music, but make no mistake, this is Alice In Chains. So, is this the best Alice In Chains has to offer? Hell yeah! Is it the best album of the year? Quite possibly, but the year's not over yet.
076532413X|4.0|In 2009 some of the world's leading research physicists gather at the CERN research facility to conduct an experiment using the Hardon Collider to \\"capture\\" the Higgs Boson subatomic particle.  The lead scientists Lloyd Simcoe and Theo Procopides anticipate success and a subsequent Nobel Prize.  However something occurs around the globe at the moment the atom smashing experiment begins.  Every human on earth who survives sees a two minute visionary clip of themselves in 2030.<br /><br />However, millions died when the collective sub-consciousness led to all types of accidents and disasters during the 120 seconds.  Simcoe is stunned more so with what he saw rather than the deadly fiasco the experiment caused.  He is engaged to marry one woman, but saw his wife of the future was another female.  Theo had no vision so he assumes he will be dead before 2030; he believes he will be a murder victim.  They try to replicate their experiment, but fail until they realize timing is everything as they go for a third try when a neutrino shower occurs as both want more information about the future regardless of cost.<br /><br />This is an engaging cautionary science fiction thriller that uses the Frankenstein concept of scientists having no ethical boundaries experimenting, even encouraged by the second and third times they replicated the experiment.  The story line is fast-paced and exciting, but chooses the thriller aspects over the emotional elements beyond a personal need to know. The two scientists know their experiment killed more people in two minutes than some of the monsters of history did during brutal reigns yet they don't seem to care on a personal level.  Still this is an exhilarating thriller as the world sees a flash forward moment and each reacts accordingly to what they prefer to see.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B000031EGV|5.0|Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play. But remember: once you start this game, you can't stop. If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.  \\"Jumanji\\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things. Only finishing the game will make it all go away.  In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added. Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself. He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing. The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams! Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.  Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles. He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt. The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type. The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \\"This is MY baby\\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page). Highly recommended for old and young alike.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Amazing hooks, great harmonics and a message that might be lost on newer generations. References to 1984, Anthem and Brave New World to name a few, make for a very powerful album theme. Even the cover has meanings that hint to Rand's Atlas Shrugged philosophy.  If I had to give some kind of negative critique, it'd be that there's just not enough of a good thing here, especially the Exogenesis finale.    My wife insists that I include \\"It's the bomb\\" in here as well. Enjoy!
B0000025T6|5.0|Nebraska -- an acoustic album with subtle electric touches.  Existential heaviness dominates as the characters search for some kind of deliverance, be it returning to a girlfriend or facing execution.  The songs, like the cover photo, are black and white desolation and starkness.  The performances have the same intimacy and loneliness of old Folkways recordings.  Through it all, a sense of honesty, integrity, and beauty resonates.    Nebraska may be Bruce Springsteen's best album.  It is certainly one of the best I have ever heard.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I cannot praise this Blu-ray release enough.  They went above and beyond to not only clean up an already awesome movie to look gorgeous in it's full HD glory, but they added so much to each scene.  Seriously, they added around 30 minutes to the feature film and enhanced pre-existing shots with around 1,000 edits.  Again, if you enjoyed the DVD, sell it and buy the Blu-ray.  You won't be disappointed.
B000J103PC|5.0|I loved this movie. Meryl Streep acted this part beautifully. You would expect that type of boss to be overbearing & in your face. But she plays it low key, soft, exactly opposite of what you would expect but hits the target making the employees at her beck & call. Brilliant acting. Love Anne Hathaway too she is perfect in this part as the oblivious new employee trying to catch a break. Loved Stanley Tucci in his part. His one liner comments all the time are funny & perfect & he plays this part perfectly. This is a movie I like to watch over & over. Buy it because it is a great movie to add to anyone's collection.

1439102813|5.0|The author has a gift for story-telling! I don't know anyone with dementia, yet I was gripped by this story from the first paragraph, and finished it in one day. I became Alice, experiencing her decline right along with her. My heart broke again and again as her world kept shrinking and her family watched helplessly.     I'm especially moved by the way Lisa Genova has unfolded the story through Alice's eyes. It reminds me a little of Flowers for Algernon. We observe things Alice doesn't because we remember her past better than she does. Still, we are completely in each moment with her, experiencing her fears and frustrations as well as simple joys when her mind reduces her to a trusting childlike figure.    The next morning after finishing the book, I puttered around my kitchen with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes, wanting to cry for Alice. I'm sure I will never forget her. I won't forget her imperfect family members, either, who had to learn to deal with this excruciating and continually developing situation.     I so appreciate this book. It has opened my eyes to the plight of so many families and stirred my interest in the subject of dementia. I hadn't even known before that early-onset Alzheimer's could hit people so young! Thank you, Lisa, for such a beautiful and helpful contribution.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|There's quite a bit of hoo-ha about this being little more than another Cantrell solo album, a legitimate concern that should be addressed. Both Bogey Depot and Degradation Trip were good in their own right, but only in the way a solo album from a Beatle is good. More often we tend to notice what's NOT there, rather than what is.<br /><br />This release can't escape that same awful feeling that something is missing. Where's that angst-ridden, chilling voice that dragged us into the depths of its addiction and self-loathing? Layne Stayley's spirit certainly runs through both of Jerry's solo albums and the new AIC is no different. But the album is far, far from some run of the mill Cantrell record.<br /><br />First, the songwriting is far superior to most of Cantrell's solo stuff, despite the fact that he pens the majority of the songs here. He's raised his game considerably, and most of the tunes are on par with Facelift and the \\"Grind\\" album (self-titled), if not quite reaching the brilliance of Dirt or Jar of Flies. Layne is noticeably absent, but Cantrell and new vocalist William DeFoe do an admirable job of utilizing the diminished vocal harmonies and tortured sounds that Layne perfected in his day. The other MAJOR difference between this and Cantrell's solo stuff is the rhythm section of Inez and Kinney, another irreplaceable element of the AIC sound at this point. Kinney has a certain drunken haphazardness that finds it's way into prog/art rock territory at times, and there's a maturity in both his and Inez's playing that Cantrell didn't quite capture in his other projects.<br /><br />This may be hard to put a point on, but the biggest difference between this and Cantrell's solo offerings is the sheer depth of the songwriting, the denseness of the instruments, and the weight of the lyrics. It's as if he's saying, \\"Yeah I did two solo records, but THIS album is *important*.\\" It's obvious that the whole band, including DaFoe approached this album with the dignity and gravity expected from longtime fans of Alice. They mostly deliver, and do great justice to the legacy. It will be interesting to see how much DaFoe contributes to future projects, as he lurks in the background quite a bit here. That may be partly out of respect for Layne, and partly because if this machine was ever going to find its feet again, Cantrell had to step up. And step up he has.from longtime fans of Alice.

B00001U0E1|5.0|Great script, great cast, great acting, and Gwyneth Paltrow too, what's not to like? The sets are realistic, (especially the Globe) and the idea that all female leads were played by males throws out any number of interesting layers of interpretation. As someone involved in the arts, I live with the idea that art can transform society. My only question: what happened to Voldemort's brother?
0375413405|5.0|Tried the Beef Bourguignon receipe that was so popular from the movie \\"Julie & Julia\\" and I have to say...Yes, it was YUMMY!!  There were a lot of steps involved but, was it ever worth it!!  Bought a copy for my Niece and we are going to cook the same receipe together, even though we're 1200 miles apart.  Can't wait!!  For those who love to cook and, yes, spend most of your day in the kitchen, I highly recommend. The end results leave you feeling quite satisfied with yourself, and your family and guests will sing your praises!!!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|The music is very haunting.  With 32 tracks I've found that I end up skipping some very intense songs but overall I still end up with a decent amount of playing time.  Beautiful scores with modern composition qualities including a minor string section and intense percussion in several tracks.  Most songs have a steady beat and are good for dance choreography.  Highly recommended!
B001V9LRV0|5.0|This is a very wonderful in depth look at the festival. I liked the detail of the event provided from all sides of the production. I enjoyed the songs and guitar licks that were not included on the original movie. I laughed I cried and I rocked out big time. We need another Woodstock generation. Buy it, enjoy it and remember just how long ago this was. Peace and Love!
B000VS6QTK|5.0|I rented this, then bought it. It's the only concert vid I've watched more than twice and it's because the music is produced perfectly on this recording. TURN IT UP! It's definitely best loud.<br /><br />If you're a guitarist who loves Angus' playing, get this. You won't regret the shots of him shredding, and you'll be amazed at the sound he gets from his wireless GS.<br /><br />If you're a bassist who loves Cliff's playing, get this. You won't regret watching how the bottom end should be done correctly -- while singing.<br /><br />If you're a rhythm guitarist who is curious about the brains behind this band, get this and watch how it's done --  with a Gretsch guitar.<br /><br />If you're a drummer who needs to learn how to play without using ride cymbals or elaborate fills, get this. Chris Slade, the replacement for Phil Rudd (who'd now back in the band) is a master of killin' it without flash or fills. And if you want to see how 1/8th notes are done at 200 bpm, he shows you how to do it, -- for over ten minutes.<br /><br />If you're a singer who loves Bon Scott, too bad. You'll have to suffer through Brian Johnson's screeching. I know, I know, you either love his singing or hate it. Now you know where I stand.<br /><br />If you're just a fan who wonders how Angus stays so thin, get this so you can see him run about 5 miles during his performance. It's almost unbelievable.
B000CQO0WQ|5.0|When you first hear Anneke on the opening track \\"Strange Machines\\" it is such a beautiful sound that you can't imagine anything else on here could even compare, but as each song goes on and you get into the flow of the music, the continuation,  and the changes that take place; you realize you are on a fantastic journey into a masterpiece of an album. You are not looking for a single with hooks and chorus that are played over and over on the radio day after day; you are looking for pieces of a puzzle that lead you to the complete picture of perfection and an underlying beauty that was there from the start.       There are sounds on here I hear out of the blue during the day, as clear as day, and there is a haunting melody that has to be heard over and over till you are tired of such delightful sounds. This to me is really the final destination of the Gatherings ever evolving sound, it would hit it's pinnacle on Mandylion and Nighttime Birds which followed a couple years later.     Very inspirational symphonic metal I guess it's referred to most often with female vocals featured throughout, done many years before it would become the norm, the formula has been tweaked and things have been added and taken away, but for me no one ever did it as good as the Gathering did it back in 1995-1997.
B002KVSJ64|3.0|First off I love BB. I like this album, but it doesnt catch me like my favorite We Are Not Alone did and Phobia second. My all time favorite song from BB off their first album is Next to Nothing. The music has gotten darker and I dont like it as well as I used to. I dont understand why almost all bands think they need to \\" keep up with the times\\" and all their music gets mellower. I believe alot of people feel like me in the sense that your earlier music is what made us huge fans and if it stayed the same we would stay greatful loyal fans. I am sure a couple songs will really grow on me, but not grab me like their earlier music.
B0000028RR|5.0|Listening to this back in '93 seemed like the most explosive, invigorating type of music there was available to the ears. Of course that really depends on your tastes and what get's you off, but to me nothing could create such emotions like Rage's first Cd.    Going into a Coconuts record store (we had those back then), and wanting to find this one, I asked the sales clerk and she didn't seem to have ever heard of them...although she did laugh with me that Jennifer Love Hewitt had a CD out about that time. Anyway, I did find the CD and tell her they were this amazing band I had heard in a club recently...and they were on Mtv probably on 120 minutes or something..?    This to me was the crowning achievemnet in rap...rock/metal, whatever it is called nowadays, you know that stuff Anthrax and Public Enemy were doing and Run DMC dabbled with back in teh day. An Entire CD of rapping with loud guitars, powerful messages...not cheesy girl meets boy stuff, this was raw crazed in your face music to mosh to, to listen carefully to, and to get absolutely crazy to(o). All the songs are good, and they are all different, it's truly amazing the sounds Morello makes with the guitar, the energy of Zach. Body Count was another band (with Ice T) that was around while this was out and the two together were quite a combination, throw on some Rob Zombie, Biohazard, Beastie Boys, even some Urban Dance Squad too if you want and right there you have got yourself quite the early to mid 90's playlist for your retro party.     And with all the (millions) of imitators and really bad rap rock that would come soon after that never even came close to this one no less, it remains the most influential and imitated perhaps of it's genre.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was way better then I thought it would be. It def worked your butt out. I thought I would be moving on to the second level in about 2 weeks, but it will prob take a month. Awesome cardio and toning!
B000002IWH|4.0|Back in the early 90's, all these artists were basically on the cutting edge I guess of rock and alternative rock. Most of these tracks I believe were only on this CD for years till they found their way on to comp discs once these artists collected enough catalog to put one out. It can pummel you one minute, and soothe you the next, and it lifts your spirits for the most part, even makes you think about something other than your problems at the time, for me with great music, it provides an escape from the trials of life and for a young mind that is quite often a road well traveled.    Rollins Band, NIN, Helmet, Pantera, Rage Against The Machine, The Cure,  Thrill Kill Kult, Violent Femmes...to have all these bands with rare/new songs at the time on one CD, and have them be Good songs (!) is what makes this soundtrack to me about as important as maybe the Singles Soundtrack, or the Judgement Night Soundtrack from around these times.    I have really never even seen the movie, but this collection always paints a nice picture of what it might be like. This CD brings back alot of memories of some type of nervous anxiety about the world and trying to grow up in a world that seemed so big and confusing to me. As if we all knew what it was all about one minute and had it by the (horns) and the next minute it seemed to spiral out of control, the type of day you had seemed to predict the type of music you would listen to that night.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|Note: The review that follows is of the Diamond Edition of Snow White that includes DVD and Blu-Ray in a \\"Combo Pack,\\" accompanied by a wealth of special features that really are special. For reasons known only to Amazon, reviews of earlier versions - those that are of significantly inferior quality in terms of production values - are recycled for inclusion with reviews of the latest version. Note that two of the first three reviews now featured were posted in 2001.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />I first saw this film in the Shore Theater in the Windsor Park area of South Chicago and have since seen it several dozen times in the VHS and subsequent DVD format. Snow White and Pinocchio are my favorite Disney feature animated films. I was delighted that Disney released the Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Pinocchio earlier this year and now we have the Diamond Edition of Snow White that includes DVD and Blue-Ray in a \\"Combo Pack,\\" accompanied by a wealth of special features that really are special. As a result of all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration and Disney Enhanced High Definition sound, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs once again possesses all of the magic that previous versions of Disney's first animated feature film do not.<br /><br />In an article about the Walt Disney Family Museum that appeared in The New York Times (October 1, 2009), Edward Rothstein observes: \\"By the time [Disney] created his first feature-length work, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' he had transformed the very notion of animation. Disney insisted that cartoons literally animate their world, bring it so thoroughly to life that even inanimate objects would react to events. He pushed his staff to strain for realism (and sponsored drawing classes in his studios). But he was interested in something more than reality; even tables and trees would display character.\\" I include Rothstein's insightful comments because the animation of otherwise inanimate objects is brilliantly enhanced by all-new state-of-the-art digital restoration. In the Blu-Ray format, the images in Snow White seem even more vivid than I what I recall seeing in a theater and the songs are much more enjoyable because of their presentation in Disney Enhanced High Definition sound.<br /><br />The plot is based on one of the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm and Jacob, and the songs were composed by Frank Churchill (who also wrote the music for \\"Dumbo\\" and \\"Bambi\\") and Larry Morey (who also wrote the lyrics for \\"Bambi.\\") Together they wrote over 25 songs for Snow White but (ironically) only seven were used. After the success of that film, Churchill was promoted to Supervisor of Music at the Disney Studios. There are several of Disney's core themes developed, notably the constant threat of evil and efforts to flee from it as well as the importance of trust and the power of faith. Moreover, whereas a castle or cottage is merely a residence, wherever one is able to be with loved ones is \\"home.\\" Even the forest animals who live nearby become involved with household chores, soon after Snow White arrives at the dusty, disorganized sylvan \\"pad\\" shared by seven bachelors.  Given the fact that they haul diamonds from the mine each day, you'd think they could afford a cook and maid. Apparently not.<br /><br />Disney will offer this \\"Combo Pack\\" for a limited time only and it really does offer significant value-added benefits that include an all new music video performed by Sonny with a Chance's Tiffany Thornton, an exclusive sneak preview of The Princess and the Frog, \\"What Do You See?\\" and \\"Jewel Jumble\\" game exercises, newly discovered storyboards for \\"Snow White Returns,\\" a tour of Walt Disney's original Hyperion studios, and \\"Dopey's Wild Mine Ride\\" game. Even without any supplementary features such as these, however, this version (in either the DVD or Blu-Ray format) is, in my opinion, the most complete masterpiece of all the great feature-length animated films. Noneother combines as effectively his one does both drama and delight in terms of plot, character development, and music.<br /><br />In a review of Snow White for The New York Times in 1938, Frank Nugent wrote, \\"Wars are being fought as the picture unreels; crimes are being committed; hatreds are being whetted; riots are being brewed. But the world fades away when M. Disney begins weaving his spell and enchantment takes hold.\\" In his biography of Disney, published in 2006, Neal Gabler observes that other critics \\"cited the awesome power of the sheer technical achievement: the collaboration of the nearly six hundred employees who drew, inked, and painted the quarter-million drawings in what totaled two hundred years' worth of man-hours. While no animated cartoon had ever looked like Snow White, and certainly none had packed its emotional wallop, it was also true that in none would the investment of time, energy, and devotion be so palpable. In some respects it was the cinematic equivalent of a Gothic cathedral - only in this case all the man-hours were expended in service to one man's vision rather than God's glory.\\"<br /><br />Most of those who see this film could not care less about its cultural significance, nor about its seamless integration of theme with technology, of inspiration with execution. They will almost immediately be delighted by the lead characters and enchanted by the life they share. Now restored and enhanced, Snow White once again has the technical brilliance and emotional power that were premiered at the Cathay Circle Theater on the evening of December 21, 1937. According to one observer, Bill Peet, \\"everyone in that first Snow White audience could have predicted the enormous success of the film. They were carried away by the picture from the very beginning, and as it went along everyone was bubbling over with enthusiasm and frequently bursting into spontaneous applause.\\" To the best of my knowledge, no other film made more than 70 years ago continues to have the same impact that it did when first released.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is the by far the best movie of the year, if not the best I've seen. It's quirky, entertaining, adorable, funny and refreshing. I've only seen it once, but as soon as it's released I plan to purchase and watch it time and time again. Joseph Gordan Levitt delivers an impressing performance as a sweet, incredibly cute, and relatable character. To see a classic love story portrayed in such a realistic and fresh manner was a pleasant surprise. The dialogue is clever and witty, the plot never dulls,and the movie's replete with poignant yet hilarious scenes that will stick with you long after the credits roll.  Zooey Deschanel manages to pull off aloof and alluring without seeming conceited.  500 Days of Summer is a delightful emotional rollercoaster you'll want to ride again and again.  Also, the soundtrack is killer.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Totally awesome movie. This is in my list for favorite movies of the year. Where to start? Well this movie is an excellent addition to the zombie genre. That's a major accomplishment in itself because there are literally hundreds of movie in the genre with only a couple dozen that really stand out. Also bear in that from what IMDB says this is Ruben Fleischer's third feature. He's basically a baby as far as directing goes, but he directs the movie with energy, flair, and an obviously love for zombie movies.     Let's get to the movie now. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson star as two zombie killers going cross county for a non zombie place to visit. Perfect casting. Jesse is an obviously and up coming young actor whose already made a splash for himself in Hollywood. Woody Harrelson he has more experience and so he brought he a lot to his character of Tallahassee. Harrelson has played tough guys like \\"Tallahassee\\" before in his career.  Harrelson is the funniest dude in the movie reminding me of  Bruce Campbell's ASH by providing a larger than life zombie killer and hero full of profanity, humor, and intensity. Not to mention his constant obsession over finding the last twinky on Earth priceless. Tallahassee has  great lines too like \\"Thank God for rednecks\\", and \\"time to nut up or shut up\\" to name a few.     Jesse Eisenberg plays the nerd who provides narration for the bulk of the movie. This guy is a riot. He's got a whole list of do's and don'ts about fighting zombies and staying alive. They seem idiotic at first but are pretty much a standard to follow. Nobody in this movie has an actual name aside from Bill Murray in a hilarious cameo appearance!!! I found this to be pretty refreshing as you find out stuff about the characters as time goes on. Every character has their own quirks and routines, so it's lovable to see it come out.    Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin round out the main cast as the two girls who meet up with \\"Columbus\\" and \\"Tallahassee\\" to fight ofthe zombies.    Fleischer makes the characters interesting by having the characters deal with zombies and probably being the last people alive on earth in their own different way. He establishes the scenes well and always deliver what the scene wants. No scene is ever wasted.    The movie moves quickly when it has to deliver action but stops enough for us to enjoy it. As Tallassee says \\"You have to enjoy the little things.\\" So in this movie we not only the little things about zombies and zombie warriors but the big things too.    I love the movie. It's got everything that a zombie fan would want and then some!!!

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was an amazing, adventurous story that kept me interested & Catching Fire has gone beyond. Suzanne is an amazing writer. Can't wait for the next installment.
0439023491|5.0|[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] by Suzanne Collins follows up where [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] left off.<br /><br />In this novel, Katniss discovers that her final act in the arena had unintended consequences and she must now decide whether to run and hide with her loved ones or face a new reality--rebellion. However, readers may find that the final act in the hunger games is not necessarily the catalyst for the rebellion so much as the Capitol's unwitting acceptance of her defiance for the rules.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]], like [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]], is an excellent book club selection for adults given the regime that makes up Panem and the inner workings of the Capitol itself. From democracy run amok in the Capitol to a dictatorship or totalitarian regime in control of Panem and its districts. While the totalitarian/dictatorship of the Capitol may not be precise in that President Snow's manipulative actions run contrary to traditional totalitarian/dictatorship reactions of crushing the enemy and rebellion with an iron fist, readers will have a number of issues to discuss. However, Collins may not be intentionally shedding light on these political structures, but simply writing dystopian fiction.<br /><br />Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, and Gale find more action and intrigue in the sequel and must deftly navigate the twisted rules and procedures of their nation to find themselves and freedom. Katniss, Peeta, and Gale are still in the midst of a young-love romantic triangle, but again the struggles they face against the government take precedence. More is revealed about Haymitch in this book, which readers will find helpful given his past behavior, but still too little is known about the how the current government came to be and who President Snow really is and how he came to power.<br /><br />If readers think the mockingjay on the cover is a nice touch, they may soon get sick of the symbol as Collins uses it repeatedly in her narration. However, its use is not overly bothersome, just a bit overdone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, readers will be introduced to new characters, like suave Finnick, unintelligible Mags, and Nuts and Volts, rounding out the cast for some additional suspense, drama, and amusement. The final scene in the book will leave many in shock, but anxious for the next installment. Overall, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] is a strong middle book to the trilogy.uch, they may soon get sick of the symbol as Collins uses it repeatedly in her narration.

B002FRNCG0|5.0|...And we'll dig a deep hole, to bury the castle!!      Alright so I'm a 15 year old guy from middle of somewhere Wisconsin and I became a fan of Paramore in early 2008 when my friends introduced me to music videos for the songs Crushcrushcrush & Misery Buisness from their sophmore album \\"Riot!\\" which I asked for and recieved at Christmas last year. I love Riot!, but there was some room for improvement in that album. It rocked, but not every song totally hit it off for me. Enter \\"Brand New Eyes.\\" I was browsing around amazon.com a week or 2 ago and saw that they had this album on pre-order for $9.99 and thought that I would get it. Well, today I got it in the mail and to be totally honest, it pulled a John Wilkes Booth on me. Snuck up on me and blew my brains out (only in this case that's a great thing, not in any way a tragedy)    -1-__Careful: First song on the album, maybe my favorite on the cd. Sounds a lot like The Paramore I know from Riot! and their 1st album \\"All We Know is Falling,\\" only x2. Very fast, catchy, and Haley Williams' range is displayed beautifully in this song. Well, her voice rocks in every song haha, but this song showcased it awesomely.     -2-__Ignorance: \\"Brand New Eyes\\" single #1, I thought this song would be the best on the cd, I was hooked on listening to the song through watching the music video for it online and loved it. I still love it, a little more of vintage Paramore. Love this song, especially the lyrics to the chorus.    -3-__Playing God: This song is the first on the album to really represent their new sound, mellower sound that still rocks. The song has got a great point to it and is very catchy.    -4-__Brick by Boring Brick: This song is so much fun to sing along to, it's got an addictive tune to it, the drums really stand out in this song, the lyrics are awesome (as most of the songs are), The bridge goes very well with the song as it stands out from the speed of the song but fits in perfectly with it somehow, and I can garuntee that this will end up as one of your favorites on the cd.    -5-__Turn it Off: Haley Williams is amazing. Her vocal ability shines through this song, as does Josh Farro & Taylor York's guitars, Zac Farro's drums, and Jeremy Davis' bass especially. The song flows really well.    -6-__The Only Exception: The even softer, sweeter side of Paramore. They pull out the acustic guitars for this one and it sounds. It was by this song that there was the thought in my mind that this album may have already surpassed Riot! on the freakin good music meter. And the rest of the cd proved me right!    -7-__Feeling Sorry: The Pace picks up again as Taylor and Josh pick up there Fenders again put in another solid track to the album. The Bass and drums also sound awesome in this song    -8-__Looking Up: Another great song with one of my favorite beats on the cd. The whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh's in this song are extremely catchy and the guitars in this song sound awesome. By now I know, this is even better than Riot, something that I wasn't totally expecting when I ordered this cd. I was wrong in thinking this would be a \\"good\\" album and I'm I was. This is an amazing album!    -9-__Where the Lines Overlap: \\"No one is as lucky as us! Is as lucky as, us.\\" Another great song lyricly, this song has one of my favorite beats on the whole cd. This song is very smooth and yet another example of Haley Williams vocal skill, and the way the whole band can keep you coming back for more.\\"    -10-__Misguided Ghosts: The 2nd acustic song on the cd...wow. This song is magical...one of my personal favorites. It's so...pretty, soft, almost feels like a daydream. Your lost in it for a while. However, also like a daydream, this song is rather short which is kind of a shame because it's so good.    -11-__All I Wanted: The songs closing track, starts out slow but picks up speed as it goes along. Kinda like your dads oldsmobile, only once it picks up it seems more like a Mustang. Haley's screams in the song areamazing, and are a great way to cap off an amazing cd.     Bascily, each and every one of the songs on the cd are outstanding! I couldn't recommend this cd more, I love it to death! I've been listening to it all day, I can't get enough of it! It's totally worth your $10! The only downside is you'll go through some Paremore withdrawal when it's not in your cd player, your car, on your iPod, or whatever. Believe me, \\"Brand New Eyes\\" IS. THAT. GOOD. BUY IT.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Steve Vai shows in this concert DVD why he's one of the greatest guitarists on this planet.  He plays so effortlessly and with such enthusiasm. The members of the band are top notch musicians who compliment Vai's intensity on stage.  The sound quality of this disc is superb and the camera work and editing are perfect. You can see Vai's mastery of the frets clearly because the cameras are focused on him every time he unleashes one of his jaw dropping solos. This disc is a must have for any Steve Vai fan or any guitarist looking for inspiration.
0743583256|5.0|This is the first fiction book I've read in years, which was prompted by a reference made in a webinar promoting David Meerman Scott's \\"World Wide Rave\\" - which touted \\"Still Alice\\" as using techniques of effective viral marketing. Initial interest was based on this reference but was furthered when I discovered that the author, Lisa Genova is a fellow Cape Cod resident as well as a Harvard trained neuroscience Ph.D. - this makes for an interesting combination and shines through in this work. This book is a must read for both fiction and non-fiction lovers alike for a number of reasons. First, the creative style of a Cape Cod resident is evident here from everything from the artistic style of the book cover to the creative writing. Since moving to Cape Cod I have found this area promotes a certain creative sense inherent to the environment, and this is obvious in this book.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author's treatment of a difficult, painful subject is done so in a positive light, my expectation was that the book would be sad throughout - especially at the end, however I had found that delivery is everything, and the author's delivery of a difficult topic raises awareness, but in a positive, uplifting manner, not an easy task given the subject matter, however very effective. Finally, the author's training in neuroscience is apparent throughout the book but not in a manner that one might expect. The author's background in this field provides an underlying credibility, as she periodically explains what is occurring as the book progresses but in a manner that is surprisingly easy for a layman to comprehend and serves to accentuate rather than distract from the tale. Overall I had found \\"Still Alice\\" to be an effective interweaving of creativity and science and is definitely worth reading - pick up a copy, you will not be disappointed!
B000LGZHDS|4.0|My daughter is pleased with this toy.  She sleeps with it.  She's a big Spongebob fan.
B000P0J024|5.0|I used to listen to anything that just plain sounded good and that was it. When I got introduced to the Wilbury's I was very impressed with the group. As Tom Petty said, \\"it's George's band, it's always George's band\\". This treat contains 2 cd's and a dvd, and they are impressive. It was good to see Roy Orbison laughing and George, Jeff, and Tom laughing, made me laugh as well. I like to think that Roy died a happy man. The Wilbury's went platinum right before his death. His other bandmates were his pallbearers. Now I have placed Roy as my favorite singer. You see after I heard teh Wilbury's, my change in music occured. I was buying cd after cd of Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne or the Electric Light Orchestra, and George Harrison. All 3 of whom I've become huge fans of. I bought a couple Tom Petty albums. I can honestly say that if it wasn't for the Wilbury's, I wouldn't of been very interested in music. I guess I consider the supergroup, my acorn or roots.     Come to think of it as another person here mentioned, there was a 6th member, Jim Keltner. From what I heard of him, he's always been a friend of the other guys.     The price was reasonable, the time I got this music couldn't of been better. I recall that I was having bad days, and I regained good spirits, especially after Roy singing 'not alone any more'.    There is one negative aspect I feel the need to point out: Bob Dylan was never present at the outside area when the others hung out, I guess he joined the group just for the sake of gaining popularity. I also noticed in the picture with the 5 present, when Roy and George sitting down, he's in the middle, or should I say trying to be the center of attention. He never laughed when the others laughed when Roy sung the words 'trembling wilbury'. Sorry, just feel the need to tell what I observed.     Moreover, if you are a huge fan of the Wilbury's then this treat is a must have. Even if you are a huge fan of one of the bandmates, or 2, or 3, you will be pleased.Lastly, I will say this about each of them:    Roy Orbison, thank you very much for your performances, your music I'll continue to cherish. R.I.P and hope your present world has become a better place of eternal rest and happiness.    Jeff Lynne, your my next favorite member, your talents and arrangements and voice with this group and with ELO have been remarkable. They have always kept my head up. Thank you.    George Harrison, the supergroup I realize was your dream from start to finish. You've possessed a happy gift to so many that you were known by many for your creation of music and known by few for your kindheartedness. R.I.P George and I hope whereever you are, it's become a better place.     Tom Petty, I noticed you've paid tributes to the Wilbury's numerous times and to the other bandmates. Your voice contributed to the overall group sound as well, and thanks.    Jim Keltner, although it is so that you've been in the shadows of such a supergroup, however, I like to think that the drums were the backbone to the music. Your one of the guys who got the Wilbury's going. Thanks Jim.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie is awesome! I would recommend reading the book first and then watching the movie as I did. The movie will flow more smoothly for you if do becuase it jumps around in time (I have trouble following stuff like that). Emile Hirsch did a great job. If you have a primitive urge to experience life in the raw with next to nothing then this movie should be to your liking.

B000VRIQ58|5.0|This was/is a bittersweet album for me.  Boston came out during my youth: 15-16.  They were one of the great bands of 'my time', along with Kansas, Foreigner, Yes, etc. I'll never forget seeing them live at the Spectrum in Philly.<br /><br />For those rockers that also grew up during those times, I'm sure you remember the first Boston album came out during the rise of Disco -- the Dark Ages of music.  Boston was a breath of fresh air and assured us that even with Disco dominating the airways, there was still something right with the music of that time. It further assured us that our era would not be defined by a guy in a white suit, dancing on a lighted floor.  I'm sure, many if not most of us wore out our first Boston album on our now-looked-upon-as-crude turntables, with our diamond-tipped styli ripping through the vinyl album.  It is easily one of the greatest albums of all time. Don't Look Back was a worthy successor to the first.<br />Third Stage is, well, Boston's third album.  Not much to say beyond that.  It's Boston, through and through.<br /><br />Now, my rant.  Why so long?  I understand Tom Scholz' desire for 'perfection'.  But how much music have we lost because of his stubbornness?  Personally, I don't care too much about Sib, Fran and Barry.  Boston is, was, and will always be Scholz and Delp.  Tom's sound and Brad's vocals.  The other guys are easily replaceable.  And I didn't want them to put out cookie-cutter sound every six months just for the sake of releasing something.  But years and years between albums was frustrating.  And now Brad is gone and there will never be any more music from Boston.  Tom can try and find a sound-alike, but it will never be Brad; he can add more and more layers of vocals and guitar riffs, but More Than a Feeling will never sound the same again.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a Boston fan, buy this album.  Although, it should now be called \\"The Final Stage.\\"<br /><br />R.I.P, Brad.
B0002ZMITY|2.0|The Bottom Line:    The reason Sasha Baron Cohen is funny is because of the fact that he's springing his outrageous personas on real people, so I have no idea why the creators of Ali G Indahouse thought they should change the nature of Cohen's comedy by putting his Ali G character through a series of very scripted and largely unfunny motions that take him away from his strong suit; the problem would be rectified in Borat and Bruno, but this film (which tellingly wasn't given a theatrical release in the U.S.) falls flat on its face.      2/4
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Right from the start Zombieland is in your face. The opening sequence alone is just great and recalls Max Brooks' The Zombie Survival Guide.  Also, it doesn't try to copy Romero's Dawn of the Dead or any of the other countless zombie movies.<br />It's a very direct film that doesn't waste time with needless character buildup, that would only slow the pacing. Characterization is achieved in between humor and action sequences and that approach works well.<br />Zombieland starts by introducing the overly cautious and neurotic, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) who reminds me of Woody Allen back in Allen classic comedy films of the 70's.<br />Columbus is the quiet geeky guy who probably spent his high school years over thinking every detail and was quite possibly bullied by jocks. Now in a zombie infested world, he is forced to become more manly and athletic when taking on the undead.<br />Then there's Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who is the gung ho bad ass. I think every zombie movie needs a Tallahassee type because they are so much fun to watch.  Harrelson really steals the show in Zombieland. I don't think I've seen him this good since Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. He looks like he could have fun in any situation in life pre or post zombie infected. I like the scene where Tallahassee is standing next to a bright yellow Hummer and just randomly firing a machine gun.<br />Next up are the manipulating sisters, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and Wichita (Emma Stone) who are both cute and annoying.  I was annoyed with their characters at first and as their characters developed they became a little more tolerable. You also need sisters like this in a post zombie world because they will keep you on your toes. They are fun in their own ways and have both survived tough times together.  Their strong bond makes them believable and you accept them for who they are.<br />With all the wonder characters and backgrounds aside, this is really about killing zombies. Who doesn't want to roam America's highways shooting zombies?<br />It's the ultimate road movie, as the four travel together and fight hundreds of zombies along the way.<br />As much fun as that is, the ending sequence at the amusement park, cranks up the fun a lot higher. The combination of rides, amusement park games, and shooting zombies is very entertaining.<br />Director Ruben Fleischer does a tremendous job directing action in the last half of Zombieland.<br />That's what these movies are all about to me. The cheap thrills of just going for it and taking out all that pent up aggressive shooting, stabbing, running over, hammering, and beating the undead any way you can.<br />Overall Zombieland is a lot of fun and a good way to kick off this Halloween season. I hope more horror movies come out this good in Halloween.<br />Some of my favorite Zombie movies are Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Zombi 2, Undead, Shaun of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Cemetery Man, Tokyo Zombie, Braindead, and The Dead Pit.<br />Zombieland deserves its place in the upper echelon of the Zombie movie canon.ways shooting zombies?

B000067CPX|4.0|By the Way being RHCP's 2002 release and their 8th studio album was met with positive reviews from the critiques with Allmusic, Rolling Stone and Q giving it 4/5. The album spawned 5 singles. These being \\"By the Way\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Dosed\\" and \\"Universally Speaking\\". The booklet is a mixed bag. It has some all the lyrics and but not a list of whom plays what. The photographs of the band is great but the font is so so. The cover makes no sense and I have no idea what they want to convey with this. 4/5.
0767824571|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the first feature length work of the great comedy team Monty Python.   The result is a treasure of wit.  I have seen this film many times and it never fails to entertain me.   It certainly holds up with time and repeated viewings.
B000000OAH|4.0|Jazz being Queen's 1978 and their 7th studio album and received mixed reviews when it was released. Allmusic gave it positive review whilst both Rolling Stone and Robert Christgau gave it negative reviews. I agree with Allmusic and think that this is a dandy of a record. Mercury sounds amazing and the arrangements are as good as ever. Songs that stand out on this release are \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Jealousy\\" and \\"Mustapha\\". 4/5.

B000K7VHSM|2.0|I had no qualms about viewing this highly praised movie since I've seen in the past such films as \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" (directed by the gay director, John Scheslinger) and a highly rated Movie for TV \\"That Certain Summer\\" with Hal Holbrook as a divorced \\"out of the closet\\" gay man dealing with his young son's discovery about why his parents divorced. These films were both excellent and I looked forward to seeing this film but I was disappointed. Despite excellent acting from Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, the film left me cold.  I think one of the reasons was that the film focused a little too much on the two male characters and less on the women.  My question too was did Anne Hathaway's character know that her husband was gay--and what were the consequences that resulted in their marriage.  Maybe director Ang Lee's approach is a little too detached for this material and also the writing had too many questions unanswered for me to fully enjoy this film.  Sorry but \\"Crash\\" though not a perfect film really deserved the Best Picture Oscar.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|When I saw this picture in the cinema, I charmed with this concept about BATMAN, always I considered that BATMAN was something and someone else, no just a paper hero, if no a superhero, that could be introducing like a citizen with a special moral value.    This film is the best about BATMAN.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood at his best, showing us that even in darkness there is light, and even in death there is value. I must say this is probably up there with his better works like Unforgiven.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I look to you is a really great CD.Whitney Houston has not lost her magical voice.
B002KVSJ7S|4.0|Flamboyant is an understatement when listening to Mika. Like Mariah Carey's screeching at the beginning of her career, Mika is vocally all over the place with his falsetto. Instead of venturing into unexplored territory, Mika treads the same ground as \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\". There are some tweaks here and there, but overall, the formula is about the same, just with diminished results.<br /><br />The embarrassing video for the first single \\"We Are Golden\\" is best left unwatched. The song is decent, certainly catchy. \\"Blame It On The Girls\\", the second single is equally catchy. \\"Rain\\" is a bit tedious and repetitive. \\"Dr. John\\" is one of the better tracks here with interesting lyrics and an insanely memorable chorus. \\"I See You\\" is a good ballad, perhaps one of Mika's finest, as ballads are not his forte. \\"Blue Eyes\\" has a nice Latin beat, and demonstrates how good Mika can be when he reigns in his vocals.<br /><br />\\"Good Gone Girl\\" is over the top, and probably the weakest track here. \\"Touches You\\" is okay. \\"By The Time\\" is a duet with Imogen Heap, and it's one of the better tracks here, something different for Mika. \\"One Foot Boy\\" is okay. \\"Toy Boy\\" is one of the better tracks with its musical theater melody and interesting lyrics. \\"Pick Up Off The Floor\\" is a nice torch song to finish things off, something new from Mika.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" is good, but not great. It didn't live up to expectations set by \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\". It also didn't live up to expectations given Mika's musical training. Still a talent, don't read me wrong here. As he matures I think he'll get better like Mariah Carey got better. So, I'm being generous by giving this four stars, because it easily could be three and half. His first album is worth four and a half, maybe even five on a good day.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I will admit i have not bought this cd yet. But it sounds like a good album by paramore from the samples i listedned to. i know i wont be able to buy it for a while to listen to all of it since i'm groundedfor breaking my mom's digital camera(it was an accident, i swear)but i bet i will love it. i looove paramore.the end!
6304493681|5.0|This is the Movie that got me to pay serious attention to Anime. Although the voice acting, especially of the major sounds a little wooden sometimes, the movie is truly stunning.<br />As with many of these movies the thought and detail that goes into the cyborgs, robot think tanks etc is simply amazing.<br />Highly recommended, this one I would say you should own and not just rent.<br /><br />The TV anime series Ghost in the Shell SAC is also extremely good :-)
B000O178BY|4.0|i will admit i was dissapointed with this at first, but it grew on me. i am one insane NIN fan. i have been trying to collect everything by them!but anyway this album is OK for the most part. different but still good.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|The unexpected Cream reunion in 2005 was only the second time that the trio had performed together in 37 years, the previous occasion had been in 1993 when Cream were inducted into the Hall of Fame. The performance went well, but there were no further moves to appear together, until Clapton initiated the process by sounding out the others in 2004.   Expectations were high, almost impossibly high, given the legendary reputation of the group. However, as they explained in the interview on the DVD edition of the concert, it was not simply a replica of the music they had created four decades ago. Sensibly, they didn't try to recreate the music, no longer were they a power trio, using stacks of amps and playing at a blistering pace, whose virtuosity meant that they were improvising almost continuously. (The first example this had happened in rock/blues, although there are precedents in jazz-The Bill Evans Trio with Scott La Faro and Paul Motion.)     Instead of the power trio whose members appeared to be competing with each other, a more mellow group appeared; one that was more cohesive and unified because they weren't in competition. In these concerts, you can hear them listening and responding to each other,playing in a more mature and refined style. The highlights are the slow blues: 'Sleepy Time Time', Willie Dixon's 'Spoonful', and T. Bone Walker's 'Stormy Monday'. 'We're Going Wrong' is superior to the original on 'Disraeli Gears' and Capton's playing in particular is more incisive. The only song missing is 'Tales of Brave Ulysses', which did appear then they played in New York.         Clapton's playing has developed and Bruce's vocals are still evocative, although some of the soaring heights he once reached are no longer within reach. His fluid, dynamic bass runs are still to the fore, while Baker's propulsive style has been paired down to its essentials, hampered possibly by arthritis, but still mightily effective.      Bruce has said he would like the three toreform to work on a studio album, and if touring is out of the question, this may be the best opportunity for the another reform. There's no reason why three improvising musicians of this caliber can't produce memorable music. A few originals, some blues standards, the potential is enormous. They should produce more music together, more often, and not confine themselves to revisiting the past is a mouthwatering prospect.
074322454X|5.0|If you want a book about the \\"Hero Generation\\" that tells the story of their sacrifices, selflessness and courage, this is it. Band of Brothers tells the story of a company of the 101st Airborne from initial training through the end of the war. The young men were truly patriotic and became true athletes in training. They were elite soldiers and their training was brutal.     Once in battle, the interviews with the men show how human they are/were and yet how determined. Their bravery and the amount of action they were involved in were just phenomenal. The story of how they took out a German artillery battery at night sticks with me. One guy got shot and was dying, yet apologized for having been shot as if he didn't perform well enough. That was how they were.     I actually felt let down at the war's conclusion. To think that such men, having survived and shared such suffering and \\"glory\\" (that only they knew about except for Ambrose documenting it near the end of the survivors' lives) would be frozen in time as they were made me feel despair. Upon arrival at home in the U.S., they would be separated and have to go about the relatively mundane business of life. It's not as if they wouldn't want to sleep in clean sheets, eat well and not get shot at. But there's a void, an unexplainable let down when such soldiers return home.
1591841666|1.0|I was really expecting much more considering the status Seth has in the world of marketing.  But all he seems to say in this book is work hard, know when to cut your losses, and everything will turn out just fine.<br /><br />Wow, I never heard any of this before- NOT.  Since when has stating the obvious been so over done in a book before.
B000002G6J|5.0|Relaxing and with Brazilian beats, Jobim's classic deserves a place in one's CD collection.  The arrangements are flawless, making this CD pleasurable from beginning to end.  The whole album is soothing and includes a wide variety of musical instruments.  Everybody I've exposed it to seems to love it immediately, something unusual in itself.  I've never become tired of this album.
B002KVSJ64|3.0|I'm a Breaking Benjamin fan.  Ben Burnley grew up a few miles from the town where I live and we had many common friends (never met him, of course), so I'm quite biased.  Unfortunately, I have to say, I'm getting a little tired of the mid to slow tempo tunes... over and over... while catchy... just plodding. Still good though.    Next thing I want to see... BEN... Release the EPOCH demos from the nineties... I'd love to hear tunes like \\"Daughter\\", \\"Raining Trees\\", and \\"True\\".  I haven't heard these songs in years.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|This star wars set is great. I had never owned any of them before and so I bought this and it's great. The price for it was even better.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|4 of 5 stars to this crazy action movie. Combine Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie and you have a powerful combination. When this movie first starts it starts slowly and seems like a dumb movie about a nerd kid. In fact, I almost turned it off. What's cool is that minute by minute this movie gets better and better. By the end, you have a powerful action movie with solid characters. At first it jumps around a bit with the kid having dreams and some visual experiences that you don't know if they're true or not.<br /><br />The story is about the son of a secret agent who gets recruited into the agency (The Fraternity). Thru the whole movie, you have to suspend your thinking as things border on fantasy rather than reality (e.g. kid gets shot, they put him into a stone bathtub with fluid that repairs him; or you can make a bullet go around solid objects by putting \\"spin\\" into the bullet). Anyway, they train him and set him into the field as an assassin. Oh, did I mention the truck load of rat bombs? Well, they're part of the big ending...<br /><br />A good movie, alot of fun though a bit \\"fantastic\\". Good action and some nice special effects. I understand this was originated from a comic book which might explain the \\"fantastic\\" actions. Worth watching this!
0385504225|3.0|There are 133 chapters in this book.  At the end of chapter 130, I was ready to give this book 6 stars (yes SIX!).  I wont spoil the ending for anyone, but the end just left me shaking my head and I even felt a bit cheated.  Lets be serious though, I would recommend this book to a friend, and the average reader will be entertained throughout.  I love how Dan Brown slips in a few general tidbits here and there (ie., origins of the words \\"sincere\\" and \\"abracadabra\\") and the historical references are solid as always.  Great job Dan, but the ending really sucked dude.....
B00005QGAZ|5.0|One of the best albums ever!! The interviews/demos are amazing. The only complaint that I have is that they don't have the full version of Carousel, which is a minor irritation. But what the heck, everyone in the world should have this!!!!!!!!!!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Danny Boyle's \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has been described as \\"Dickensian,\\" and there may be no better description of this heartbreaking, funny, riveting tale of three young kids from the slums of Mumbai.    Much of the story's strength comes from its willingness to throw the viewer into a world that is completely alien to most Americans - the slums of Mumbai.  These ramshackle tin roof warrens are home to hundreds of thousands of people, each with their own stories, tragedies, and triumphs.  Like \\"City of God,\\" which ripped aside the veil to show the horrific slums just outside of the paradise of Rio, \\"Slumdog\\" shows the squalor that can be found side-by-side with such romantic icons as the Taj Mahal.    I saw \\"Slumdog\\" after all the awards and accolades, and I was worried.  Could it possibly live up to the hype?  I knew that one of the characters, Jamal (played in teen version by Dev Patel, in youth by other actors) would end up on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\\" and that he had the hots for a gorgeous gal, Latika (teen version, Freida Pinto).  Would this movie strike me as flat as \\"Juno,\\" another movie I didn't see until dozens of people had told me that \\"you have to see this\\" (turns out, no I didn't).  Or would this be like \\"Sideways,\\" a movie that charmed me out of my socks even though everyone seemingly had raved about it?    The great news is that \\"Slumdog\\" is another \\"Sideways\\" in that regard.    Using the structure of the increasing dollar amounts of \\"Millionaire,\\" \\"Slumdog\\" tells the story of three kids as they try to make their way in a harsh, bleak world that chews up and spits out kids like so many cherry pits.  No spoilers here - just prepare to be shocked at the horrors these kids face with so much aplomb as well as the snatches of beauty and humanity these kids find along the way.  Not as harsh as \\"City of God\\" by any means, \\"Slumdog\\" nevertheless contains more than its share of powerful scenes that will haunt you.    All in all, an excellent film.
B000LXHK22|5.0|We enjoyed this movie for it is a lot like \\"Bottle Shock\\" but more human.  The cast was great and it is almost like what life is like for the people who works at the wineries.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|There seems to be a little confusion with Mike Smith's review of the various versions of \\"La Boheme\\".  Yes, the 1977 DG version was historic...I remember it well.  But Scotto WAS Mimi and not Musetta...(that role was sung by Maralin Niska).  The 2008 EMI version was a total waste (as most of the EMI HD DVDs which it offered).  The 1977 DG version is the BEST, in my opinion, because it offers us the Mimi of the great Teresa Stratas and not Scotto as Mike Smith states...Scotto is Musetta on this DVD and is wonderful.  I was a great fan of Scotto and would give my eye teeth to have her Met performances of \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Il Trittico\\" on DVD.  The combination of Stratas and Carreras on this DVD is overwhelming.  Pavarotti was a magnificent singer but could never muster up enough emotion in any of his roles.  Plus we have this wonderful and atmospheric Zeffirelli Production!!!  I strongly recommend this version.  DG does a great job with remastering the video and audio of the former Pioneer Met DVDs giving us perfect clarity and surround sound. Once you SEE and HEAR Stratas, you will want no other Mimi.  I HAVE ADDED THE FOLLOWING COMMENT ON OCTOBER 28, 2009:  I received this new DVD yesterday.  DG has done a masterful job with it.  The DTS 5.1 sound is out-of-this world....sounds as if one were actually sitting in the audience at the MET.  The video is much brighter and clearer than was the old Pioneer version.  It has more language choices.  There are two excellent mini-documentaries:  Zeffirelli working the La Boheme rehearsal at the Met and one on Puccini.  This is a MUST buy.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the Ghost Rider. I do recommend this movie! First rule of being in a movie: Never sell your soul to the devil! It never works out. In this Marvel comic made into a feature movie, we follow motorcycle daredevil Johnny Blaze who does sell his soul to make his father healthy again. When the devil comes knocking we learn of the legend of the Ghost Rider; the agents who collect debts (souls) on behalf of the devil. We meet a cowboy who we later learn is also a Ghost Rider. Together they battle an evil being who is attempting to steal souls owed to the devil. An interesting story, interesting characters. Well acted, well photographed and great special effects! My favorite scene is the horse riding cowboy aside Johnny Blaze on his motorcycle both moving thru the desert at night leaving a trail of fire.<br /><br />This is one movie in which I like Nicolas Cage. This is a solid movie that I do recommend!
0316017922|2.0|After devouring both Blink and Tipping Point, it was with great enthusiasm that I began to read Outliers. Mid-way through Chapter Two, however, the hockey story from Chapter One began to haunt me; I know two professional hockey players who won, two years prior, the very Memorial Cup Gladwell referenced. Since one was born in October, the other in November, I was curious enough to check a few current hockey rosters to see how the \\"January\\" premise holds up.     What better place to start than the 2009 Stanley Cup finals where the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games. The Penguins had 13 players born before July 31, and 12 born after. The Red Wings roster is similar with 14 born in the first half of the year, and 11 in the second. A quick look at other NHL rosters shows the same pattern; about half born in the first half of the year and half born in the second half of the year. Hmm.    Becoming even more curious, I then checked the specific 2007 Memorial Cup series that Gladwell referenced: Medicine Hat Tigers vs. Vancouver Giants.  He shows the Medicine Hat roster but not the Giants roster. Why? Maybe because the Giants roster shows they only had two players born in January, with 16 born the first half of the year and 11 in the second half. And they defeated the January loaded Tigers to win the cup.     Did Gladwell really cherry-pick one Canadian team and one Czech team to establish the premise upon which the book is founded? It took me very little time to look at 15 other hockey teams, at all levels and I didn't see even a trace of consistency in Gladwell's \\"January\\" theory. While this may not disqualify the rest of the book's data, it certainly made me struggle with the integrity of the rest of the book's data. Did the publisher really think no one would check the Giants roster, or other top hockey teams?     I couldn't help but think that Gladwell tortured the data to make it speak, to fill the pages, and perhaps to please his publisher.  What a tremendous disappointment.

B002HNA95E|4.0|Considering the literally dozens of singles released by Madonna in the last twenty five or so years it was always going to be a dicey prospect to limit the number down for just two discs. That said, CELEBRATION does a more than decent job of gathering a fairly sizable number of essential Madonna recordings together in one place.  Is it the ultimate greatest hits collection from inarguably the greatest singles artist of the last quarter century?  No, it's merely a nice sampler of essentials topped off with some not so essential garnishes.<br /><br />The Up Side--everything from THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION(with the exception of the excellent and underrated \\"Rescue Me\\")has made it onto here, a good sign considering everything on that disc is essential listening.  Even better, the horrid remixed version of \\"Like A Prayer\\" has been replaced by the definitive album version.  Also of note is the inclusion of the fantastic \\"Dress You Up\\" and the number one hit \\"Who's That Girl\\"(both for the first time EVER on a Madonna compilation, which I suppose is a testament to how deep her singles catalog actually runs).  And the two new tracks, \\"Revolver\\"(which sounds like latter day Britney Spears) and the title cut, are both decent additions to her canon.<br /><br />The Down Side--unfortunately, I think the down side slightly outweighs the upside.  First, I really wish they had included the album version of \\"Express Yourself\\" as opposed to the remix, which in my book is inferior.  Also, some of edits included are equally inferior--cutting the Timbaland intro from \\"4 Minutes\\" is idiotic and the radio edit of \\"Ray of Light\\" is lacking as well. Finally, several of the tracks included in favor of better offerings is a little perplexing--\\"Miles Away\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Burning Up\\", while all good songs, don't belong over,say, \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Keep It Together\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Rain\\", or \\"You'll See\\".<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a fairly decent representation of Madonna's musical aesthetic, but as many others have noted, a definitive box set including all of her singles would have been the way to go, or at least been a nice added bonus to this set.  With this package signaling the end of her relationship with Wanner Bros., the likelihood of that ever coming to fruition is slim at best.'s musical aesthetic, but as many others have noted, a definitive box set including all of her singles would have been the way to go, or at least been a nice added bonus to this set.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|One of the best shows ever made. If you are a Buffy or even a Girefly fan this series has everything. This season is the season that usually slumps for most show but they made a major, thought consistant, change in the mythology that brought in a fresh storyline and dynamic relationship betwenn the brothers.     My one disappointment in the DVD set is the lack of great features. I haven't finished every special feature but I am on the last disk and nothing has really stood out as need to see.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|I must first say that I am not generally a fan of Neil Gaiman's work.  This movie was actually a spur of the moment thing from a friend who told me about it.  Boy am I glad they did.  This movie is absolutely fantastic.  Everything about the film is top notch, from the acting to the writing and especially the special effects.  The Jim Henson company created the visuals for this film and they have absolutely outdone themselves.  Usually you just think of the muppets when anyone mentions Jim Henson, however his company has done some amazing work before, usually not seen here in the States.  I actually grew up watching some of the films and shows that were bound mainly for the UK and England which featured work by the Henson company.  I cannot advise anyone enough to get this film on bluray.  It is brillant beyond belief and is now one of my favorite bluray titles that I own.
0385504225|3.0|If any of you have read the previous books then I assure you that you'll be able to predict everything that will happen in this book. It follows the exact same formula than The Da Vinci Code. There was only one thing that I wasn't really expecting, but that was ruined when Dan Brown turned the moment into a Hollywood moment.     If you haven't read any of the books where Robert Langdon appears, then you'll probably enjoy the book. It will keep you interested most of the times and it's a fun and easy read. Also if you haven't read any of the past Rober Langdon books, then you'll probably won't find this book as predictable.    I'd recommend the book since you can probably read it in 2-3 days, but don't expect it to wow you.

0156034026|5.0|This compact tale of a young Pakistani man forced to leave New York and return to his home country after 9/11 makes for a gripping read. True, there's a slightly contrived element to the narrative (that I'm not going to give away here), but the protagonist is fascinating, the story suspenseful, and the writing impressively self-assured. The novel manages to make a statement of social, cultural, and political weight, and be a breeze to read at the same time. Highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|Eckert Tolle's book \\"A New Earth\\" hardly needs another Amazon book review considering the 1,451 that have been submitted so far.  After reading a number of the reviews, I was startled by the extraordinary esoteric thinking of many the reviewers. This is hardly typical of the average American mind. It appears the \\"New Age\\" movement has grown exponentially and it demonstrates the immense hunger for spirituality that has been so suppressed in American culture. In a way, this is sad because it represents a hunger that much of the institutional church is not fulfilling. The critical issue is that Christian spirituality is meant to be pro-active, generating the powerful forces of love, compassion, forgiveness and caring for others while the new secular spirituality can be extremely self-centered.    I have chosen to write this book review from the perspective a Catholic peace and social activist. Regardless, none of these reviews can substitute reading \\"A New Earth\\" because one needs to personally taste the absolute eloquence and powerful spiritual insights found in Eckhart Tolle's writing. Reading Eckhart Tolle is transformational. His writing is therapeutic. Chapter three, \\"The Core of Ego\\", is definitely a prime instructional source for good mental health. \\"A New Earth\\" is one of the most important books of our time. It needs to be read by all inquiring spiritual minds and those struggling to understand the increasing violence and insanity in the world.      Eckhart Tolle's book presents a clear understanding of human consciousness, profound spirituality and the beginnings of a radical and evolutionary awakening of a higher consciousness. To arrive at this higher consciousness, Eckhart Tolle delves deeply into the dysfunction of the human ego, both in the individual and in the institutions of power and wealth. To Eckhart Tolle, \\"The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art, science or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction, its own madness\\".     Eckhart Tolle states how the love of things can contribute to the domination of the human ego and how a consumer society honors material things as a means to self-enhancement.....it distorts our perception of reality and the true nature of our humanity.     To quote Eckhart Tolle: \\"Ego-identification with things creates attachment to things, obsession with things, which in turn creates our consumer society and economic structures where the only measure of progress is always more. The unchecked striving for more, for endless growth, is a dysfunction and a disease. It is the same dysfunction the cancerous cell manifests, whose only goal is to multiply itself, unaware that it is bringing about its own destruction by destroying the organism of which is a part\\".      With \\"A New Earth\\" chosen by the Oprah Book Club, and the numerous appearances of Eckhart Tolle on the Oprah Winfrey show, Oprah has played a big role in elevating the spiritual consciousness of hundreds of thousands of American readers. Oprah must be commended for this. As I understand it, more than any other book in recent history, this book was read and reviewed by the vast majority of book clubs in the U.S. I hope \\"A New Earth\\" will be the beginning of much needed maturity in American thinking and in American Christianity as well.     Yes, to me, Christianity in America needs to mature in a spiritual way if ever there is to be greater maturity in American culture. A higher spiritual consciousness is the essential element for radical social transformation. As Fr. Richard Rohr, of the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, NM, would say, Christianity in America has become a belonging system, \\"us\\" against \\"them\\", rather than a system for personal transformation. The tragedy is that Christianity has become in some ways just another institution seeking its own perpetuation and power, dominated by the human ego.    The dysfunction of the human ego is what Christ tried so hard to get through to the minds of his disciples, particularly when he told Peter, the \\"first pope\\", to \\"get behind me you devil\\" (Mathiew 24,15) or \\"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye\\" (Mathew 7). Christ had the perfect non-dualistic mind.     In fact, addressing the human ego goes to the heart of all of the world's major religions, but Christianity seems to have walked away from it. Christianity chose to do so when it became part of the Roman Empire in 325 AD. Since then, Christianity has had a hard time critiquing the system and the unjust status quo that stems from the dysfunction of the human ego. Christianity has found it difficult to critique the system because it has become a part of the system.  The culturally imprisoned mindset of many American Christians is totally contrary to the mind of Christ.     As mentioned, addressing the problem of the human ego goes to the heart of all of the world's major religions. But not often enough do religious or spiritual writers critique the institutions of corporate capitalism. Eckhart Tolle's book is most timely to stimulate a new national conversation, particularly when considering America's \\"never ending war\\" against terrorism and the near dictatorial powers of the U.S. Military Industrial Complex.     It is time U.S. citizens recognize that government propaganda in support of war and the interests of corporate capitalism is a force that strategically preys on the weaknesses of the human ego. Actually corporate capitalism can be said to be diabolical as it seeks to enrich itself by altering human consciousness. This then exaggerates the human ego that has led to a dysfunctional society.  Eckhart Tolle never used the word \\"capitalism\\". Yet the underlying message of his writing is a severe critique of capitalism. I guess you could say the word \\"capitalism\\" has been \\"sanctified\\" in America, the unspoken word or the unseen elephant in the living room.    Eckhart Tolle avoids saying in a direct manner, \\"corporate capitalism is intrinsically evil and unsustainable\\" or \\"corporate consumer capitalism alters human consciousness and is the destroyer of the human spirit\\". You have to come to that conclusion yourself.     In March 2009, there was a conference at the Center of Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, NM called \\"The Emerging Church: Christians Creating a New World Together\\". This conference was attended by a thousand people, about half of whom were Catholic, the rest were mainline and evangelical Protestants and other Christians. Many of those at the conference believed that the future of the church will be the coming together of like minded people from all denominations who seek a more prophetic and contemplative faith. A higher global consciousness that is seeking a more just, sustainable and compassionate world is already a powerful emerging force in the world.  The \\"emerging church\\" seeks to be part of this higher social consciousness. It seeks to serve as praxis and as co-creator for the evolutionary destiny of humankind to consciously provide for the survival of it's own species. An increasing number of Christians view this higher consciousness as the universal consciousness of the risen Christ. To these Christians, the salvation and survival of humankind is what the death and resurrection of Christ is all about.      A more contemplative faith is about centering oneself in Presence, through meditation and contemplation, seeking wisdom through the gift of the Holy Spirit. This is done by embracing opposing thoughts and coming to spiritual discernment. Particularly for a Catholic activist, this centering of the human spirit is the critical means of overcoming personal anger when so involved in non-violent civic activism. Spiritual discernment goes to the heart of a healthy democracy as well. A healthy democracy is truly an act of the human spirit. Democracy is meant to work for the common good and to question the unjust status quo. This is why corporate capitalism hates democracy and seeks to destroy it with the total corruption of the U.S. Congress.     I see the teachings of scholars like Eckhart Tolle and the emerging church movement as bringing maturity to Christianity in the 21st Century.  It is the coming together of like minded people of all faiths that see the human ego, enticed by the institutions of corporate capitalism, as being the prime cause of social unrest, the scapegoating of others and the waging of war. It cannot be denied, the oppression of global capitalism is the cause of the \\"blow-back\\" of terrorism. This blow-back from war and economic domination is in reality the powerful forces of spirituality at work, the liberation of the human spirit.     In meditation and contemplation, where we seek to separate ourselves from the dominance of the human ego, we can come to see what the Divine Spirit wants us to see, the holiness of all people, to understand our own brokenness and thus becoming able to forgive others with compassion.     Father Richard Rohr stated so well in a September 4, 2009 article in the National Catholic Reporter that another word for contemplation is non-dualistic thinking. \\"That's what makes people able to be merciful and forgiving. You can't love your enemies with a low level dualistic mind. It's impossible. You don't have the software to know how to do it. So we tell people to love your enemies. A normal Catholic can't do that with the software that he or she has been given. Catholics were never taught they need a different consciousness to understand the Gospel\\".

1416594787|5.0|Dawkin's new book is without a doubt one of the foremost works -- if not<br />THE foremost -- in the area. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" is a must read for<br />anyone doubting the scientific fact of evolution, as well as for those who<br />want more evidence to support their belief. Dawkin's has produced a book<br />of lasting value, which will surely be referenced for many years to come.<br />He deliberately and dispassionately presents an iron-clad case for the fact of<br />evolution, and dispells the major misunderstandings that critics have of<br />this area of science.<br /><br />I challenge creationists who really are interested in understanding evolution<br />to carefully read Dawkin's book from beginning to end, and then ask themselves<br />if they still contend that evolutionary scientists base their arguments and<br />beliefs on faith without evidence, or if they truly ignore the many blatant<br />problems with evolution. I don't know how anyone can still come away from<br />reading this book with those opinions.<br /><br />Remember that evolutionary scientists, as all scientists, would love falsify<br />evolution - to find one clear bit of information that undermines the central<br />theses of evolution. Finding a single fossil rabbit imbedded in Cambrian-age<br />rocks would do it. There are many ways in whicn evolution could be falsified,<br />but it hasn't happened. Any biologist who could present non-biased and repeatable<br />evidence falsifying evolution would immediately be Noble Prize candidate. They<br />would have lasting fame. Biologists don't consider evolution as a fact without<br />the overwhelming evidence supporting it. Creationists just have to understand<br />what the support is, and why the standard criticisms raised against it are not<br />viable, and usually give evidence that the persons using the criticisms have<br />little understanding of the science.<br /><br />There are several other books that augment Dawkin's new work.

Tamkin is not only profoundly distasteful himself, but he manages to make the already pathetic protagonist Wilhelm even more unappealing. Still, Bellow is able to create a kind of relentless downward spiral that is admirable in its effect.

B002AWJEU8|5.0|You can bet that if Vai's putting out a DVD, you're going to get your money's worth and then some.  The musicianship is as high as can be expected, and if you're even somewhat familiar with Vai's work, this is no surprise.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most were the production values (lighting and DVD specific effects), the little touches of bizarre humor that he's known for (picking with his guitar tech, showing the scat lyrics to Firewall, shamelessly plugging himself in Tender Surrender), and the way he shared the stage with the other musicians.  That last aspect impressed me the most, actually.  He knows he can play, so he had no problem letting the band step up.  Instead of \\"Dave's Party Piece\\", he actually got to play one of his own songs from his album (albeit, and abbreviated version).  Also, the Lydian jam with Anne Marie and Alex on \\"The Crying Machine\\" was just magical.<br /><br />Like I said, if you're a Vai fan, you're gonna get this DVD, so I'm basically writing this for the casual listener/musician.  If you're interested in something different from the cookie cutter commercial garbage that out there.  Give this a listen, you might learn something!

B001ICFE1E|4.0|A fairytale for grown ups filled with dark humor and dangerous people with bad intentions.    Story:  An ordinary man's life takes a bizarre turn as he helps a battered and bloody girl lying on the street.  His simple act of kindness gets him tangled in a web of violence and mystery as he is pursued by supernatural assassins.  Before he knows it, his life is turned upside down and he's drawn into the world of 'London Below'.    Writing Style:  Neil Gaiman's writing style is very fun to read.  His dark and humorous descriptions will make you laugh, cringe, and maybe check under your bed.  The dialogue is great and will entertain you as it brings the characters to life.    Characters:  Richard is the main character.  He's an average guy with an average job who spends time with average friends.    Door is a mysterious girl from the world of London Below.  She has the magical powers to create doors and open just about anything, including a pathway to another dimension.  Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are superhuman assassins with exceptional skills.    The characters of this book are all very interesting and drive the story.  There is a whole world of characters in London Below that are insanely bizarre and react to the fantastic happenings of the underworld as if it's completely ordinary.  The characters and their actions really bring the world to life.        World:  London Above is London.  London Below is not quite London.  Instead it's full of magic, beasts, and wicked people.  It's kind of a mix between Alice in Wonderland, a trendy nightclub, and the homeless.  A myriad of bizarre events occur down there on a daily basis, and that's just the way it is.  The world of London Below is fantastic and has concrete rules and consequences which bring it to life.      Action:  There's some action and violence in the book, but this is more of a dark fairytale adventure.  It's about a journey through an amazing place.    Maturity:  There's murder, torture, violence, and hints of very bad things.  Kids should stick with Harry Potter.      Overall:  This is a fairytale for adults who want to believe that there is more to the ordinary.    This is a good thing because that's why we read fantasy.    Read this book if you want a darker twist to fairytale adventures like Alice in Wonderland, the Matrix, or Harry Potter.    Avoid this book if you're not particularly fond of London, you want more traditional fantasy with castles and dragons, or you're squeamish.
B00004ZD69|4.0|In the 1990s, there was a infinitely stupid genre label called post rock. Cul-De-Sac, Bark Psychcosis and a lot of other bands got thrown in this bag. All the music really was was a bunch of very smart artists who knew their Can and Faust and Cluster and did not give a rats tape loop about making it in the market place.<br /><br />That did not mean that great music was not made. If anything, modern digital production gave these bands tools their musical father's only dreamed of. Godspeed You Black Emperor is one of the bands that capitalized on this.<br /><br />Godspeed's music really has little to do with rock as we know it. On this album, there is no overt beat. The band starts long pieces quietly, slowly, and builts them into shimmering climaxes. This takes some time, but eventually, the volume gets quite powerful, and wait long enough, the music sneaks up to provide an indredibly emotional experiance.<br /><br />If anything, this music comes out of Stockhausan, Terry Riely and Steve Riech. It is not that Godspeed uses loops for hipnotic effect. The music builds through playing. But listening to the sustained passages. that almost freeze in time around a tonal center, and you hear the sublte shifts in volume and texture. Turn this music on and you may grow distacted, but once the goose starts cooking, you are suddenly enveloped.<br /><br />Worth your time and attention.

0385504225|2.0|You know the book is bad when...  after reading 460+ pages of a supposed thriller/mystery/adventure novel you find yourself flipping and scanning to the end of the book just to GET IT OVER WITH.      After putting in the time to read the majority of the story, I had to be able to say that I finally finished it.  Also, hoping against hope, I thought that the story might improve and that there would be a true finale to this tale.      What a huge disappointment.  The entire book was a mish mash of adages and random phrases that were supposed to make sense. Honestly, most of the story was just plain silly.  The reader cannot help but be suspicious and doubtful about the novel when there are many phrases per page that are italicized to emphasize that they are so IMPORTANT to the story.  The reader just gets numb to it all and the emphasized lines have no more meaning that any others.      With the DaVinci Code, there was a search for a specific thing - The Holy Grail.  In this book the object of the search was so poorly defined and poorly described, the very disappointing let down of an ending should have not have been a surprise.      Dan Brown had a very good idea, story and adventure with the DaVinci Code.  However, his actual writing style is poor and juvenile.  He seems to be trying to appeal to folks who do not read very much and he tries to simplify things to the point of boredom. The CONSTANT use of phrases describing someone as \\"totally terrified\\", \\"totally awed\\", \\"in absolute shock\\", etc, etc is so trite and hackneyed.     With DaVinci, the interesting tale overshadowed his poor writing and clumsy use of language.  But in The Lost Symbol, the story was too dull in itself and the bad writing made things that much worse.
0143038419|4.0|Obviously this is the kind of book which evokes a multitude of reactions and some of those are very hostile.    Elizabeth Gilbert steps on toes.     First of all; when this true story begins she is a rich, beautiful, intelligent, successful and extremely priviliged woman endowed with a wonderful sense of humor, literary skills, tons of self-irony, a husband, a house and a creative well-paid job most people can only dream of.   So how dare she be unhappy? The only thing missing in her life is a baby - well according to other people it must be.   The thing is that she doesn't want a child. And she does not want the life that other people wants her to have. She does not want to be what other people want her to be.  So, the second very provocative thing about this true story is that after a suicide attempt and a complete breakdown Elizabeth Gilbert decides to find out who she is; and to give this person, her true self, a chance.     So she embarks on a physical and spiritual and emotional journey which will change her life forever.  She learns to speak some Italian (the most beautiful language in the world) and she describes the pleasures of the palate; the joy of speaking Italian and to be able to use the simple word Attraversiamo (let's cross over) which sounds heavenly to her.  She eats anything and everything she wants to eat and it's all delicious, (she describes it quite wonderfully too) after all she is in Italy! Of course she gains some weight but she doesn't care - no romance for her.     After Italy she goes to an Ashram in India where she meditates and tells us about her encounter with \\"the indescribable\\", an experience which changes her for life.   \\"... all know that the drop merges into the ocean, but few know that the ocean merges into the drop..\\"    After India she travels to Bali where everything falls into place and she, reluctantly, falls in love.      I liked this book so much. Elizabeth Gilbert is a wonderful guide, teacher, and friend; extremely informed, and relentlessly curious, hungry for information and enlightenment and eager to share he experiences and thoughts. She has a wonderful sense of humour and, combined with a huge dosis of self-irony, it makes this trip, this adventure, this soul search, into such a great expereince to share.     I can recommend this novel for a number of reasons. It is fun to read, very enlightening, very inspiring, and she adresses the big question.    How do we find happiness?   We follow our own recipe, mantra, or heart, in life.     We eat, we pray and we love.  Om Namah Shivaya    L. Holm author
B0001CTJCM|5.0|There is a ridiculous urban legend that lingers to this day, even among smart music people: Zappa's best, or only good music, ended when the origional Mothers broke up in 1969.  Sure, that is plauseable. And there is a nice little man in my CD changer who rotates the discs when I play this double set.<br /><br />True, the first Mother's were virtuosos, and Zappa did stoke the comady and sexual hijinks after this. But the dadaism never left the music. Hearing Make A Jazz Noise here should impress any open-minded person how strong all of Zappa's work was and how the musicians he used through the 70s and 80s got better and better.<br /><br />This hefty live set features treatments of numbers from the earliest Zappa to compsitions he wrote for this tour. Cutting edge digital equiptment, sampling, and master players made this band some of the best interpraters of Zappa's entire catolouge.<br /><br />Listen no further than the horn-driven version of \\"Stinkfoot\\" which opens the album--and where Zappa gives Jimmy Swaggart the verbal drive by this waste of DNA so royally deserved--and still does. The digital onslaught here, with heavy drums and horns, is so large, the Apostropie version sounds completely malnourished. \\"When Yuppies Go To Hell,\\" I would submit, is one of Frank's last great compositions--with its samples and quicksilver parts, it is far more sophisticated than anything he had done in the alleged days of yore.<br /><br />I could go track by track extending my argument, but you get the idea. Zappa's guitar work throughout the set is also taking on astonishing new demensions; yes, processing allowed him to be louder and have more ressonece. But the playing itself is evolving. Listen to \\"Star Wars Won't Work.\\" Zappa was never a player to rest during a solo, but here, he is using such wonderfully odd rythmic sculptures, his axe work seems to be taking on new, surreal shapes.<br /><br />It is almost sad to listen to this given what was in store for Zappa. Had the master  lived to a ripe old age, I think this album is a precurser to the digital brilance Zappa would have taken as his next major direction.<br /><br />If only. But thankfully there is this. It is not enough, but is more than ample.k this album is a precurser to the digital brilance Zappa would have taken as his next major direction.    If only.

B0021L8UYE|5.0|I'll tell you now, I've watched a ton of Zombie flicks and this one brings back life to them. The cast is perfect, well the little girl is slightly out of place, but no the less. The plot of this movie is simple, but makes you want more. Woody Harilsons character stands out the most, and *****SPOILER***** the Bill Murry Cameo is amazing. If you like zombies and want to get a laugh and still get the blood and gore i recommend this movie, I personally can not wait until the DVD or Blu-Ray.

0307408833|1.0|Like so many other reviewers, I am sorely disappointed by this book. I enjoy baking, and have rarely had recipes turn out so badly that my family members, upon taking the first bite, have gotten a funny look on their faces, have attempted to chew, and then have asked permission to spit out the food (with lots of apologies and hopes that they haven't disappointed me). I have tried 3 recipes in this book -- the pumpkin muffins, the bananna bread, and the cherry cobbler. The bananna bread and cherry cobbler were completely inedible. The amount of salt in these recipes is ridiculous -- salty bananna bread? Salty cherry cobbler? They were nothing short of nasty tasting. With the pumpking muffins, I decreased the amount of salt from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp, and the muffins were still unpleasantly salty, and also had a weird taste. We managed to choke a few down, but ended up throwing the rest in the trash, just like with the other 2 recipes. As a few other reviewers point out, the ingredients for these recipes are quite pricey, so in addition to the frustration of wasting time and effort, the waste of money quite upsetting as well. In addition, the book itself is rather expensive -- I wish I could return it. At the beginning of the book, Ms. McKenna cautions the reader to follow the directions precisely to get the desired result. Well, I have done just that, and I am perfectly capable of following a recipe, given that I have never had such bad results. I cannot imagine that these are the actual recipes from BabyCakes -- the business would surely have flopped if they were.

0385504225|2.0|My preference of his books are in this order Angels & Demons, Davinci Code, and last The Lost Symbol.  In my opinion the book was the same formula as all the rest, which I like, but it got so repetitive with leaving every chapter as a cliff hanger.  Some times chapters would pass including the irritating \\"mini\\" chapters until the last hanger resolves.  Also if Peter Solomon was such a big influence on Roberts life (like a second father) why are we only now being introduced to him in this third book following Robert?  The end was about a big of a letdown as I've ever read.  Honestly. he was pretty much grasping at straws with that one..The Word.  It seemed as if Peter knew the answer all along.  The word pretty much destroyed the end of the book for me.  I felt like I wasted 500 pages of my time when the book could have been 300 with a better ending.  One big letdown.
006135323X|4.0|In Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely, a professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT, explains that--contrary to the assumption that underlies standard economics--people routinely act irrationally. Our decisions are based on factors that we're very often not even aware of. Our purchasing decisions, for example, may be influenced by an item's price (more expensive must be better) or its popularity or by the context in which we see it (surrounded by high-end condiments and displayed on fine china, for example, versus slapped in a styrofoam container). Our behavior toward others may be altered more than we would anticipate by sexual arousal. The likelihood that we'll steal depends on whether the item in question is cold hard cash or just something that could be turned into cash. (One is more likely to steal a Coke from a communal refrigerator than its equivalent in change.)<br /><br />Ariely explores a host of interesting questions related to decision-making. In each case Ariely describes, in very accessible prose, the experiments he and his colleagues conducted while researching the question. (In many cases the experiments involved students at MIT or Harvard, who were asked to answer questionnaires or look at pornographic images or buy beer or eat chocolate.) The purport of the book is that, while people do behave irrationally, they do so (as the book's title indicates) in predictable ways, because of the way our brains our wired. And if we understand more accurately how people behave in fact, rather than in theory, we can force ourselves to think differently or we can put tools in place that will result in more positive outcomes. (For example, studies show that students who take an honor pledge prior to taking a test are less likely to cheat, so requiring an honor code may be a cheap and easy way for a school to decrease cheating. Or, if you're ordering food at a restaurant without knowing what the people you're with are ordering, you're more likely to order something you really want and are thus more likely to enjoy the meal. Restaurants could improve their patrons' dining experience by introducing \\"blind,\\" private ordering.) It's an interesting and well-written book that should appeal to readers who've enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's titles, for example, or Chris Anderson's recent Free (which rehashes much of what Ariely writes in his third chapter).<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelu really want and are thus more likely to enjoy the meal.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I have box box sets of the remasters, and just started listening. My first choice, Abbey Road, is not much different sonically than the original CD released in the 1980s. Whatever differences exist are very subtle, like vocals being slightly louder. I kept reading reviews saying \\"the instruments JUMP out at you\\" etc, etc. I compared the new one to the old, and honestly, I can barely tell the difference. You can purchase either the old CD or the new one, and you won't miss anything.
0385504225|4.0|Not as good as Angels and Demons, which has been my favorite out of all of his books. The end was a bit anticlimactic for me, but true to Dan Brown, it is filled with historical facts and accuracy about the freemasons, secret societies, symbols and our countries founding fathers, among others! A very good read.I was engrossed in it until it was finished. Took me about a day. Dan Brown is always an intelligent read.

B0029LHW4U|3.0|Is there any doubt Jerry Cantrell and company can write and execute a heavy rock album? No. This album is heavy -- very heavy. It's a wall of high-gain, crushingly distorted guitars moving along at sludge-metal tempos. Songs like \\"All Secrets Known,\\" \\"A Looking in View,\\" \\"Check My Brain\\" remind us that Alice in Chains was, and still is, an brusingly heavy rock band. These guys live in minor-key melancholy, and they do it brilliantly.    For all the violently distorted guitars ... what this album is missing is the fact that Alice in Chains *also* wrote beautiful, acoustic, intimate songs like \\"Brother\\" (which is my favorite Alice song). This record doesn't feel as personal to me as their other albums.    William DuVall's role seems to be kind of undefined. Sometimes he's very present in the mix, sometimes not. I think he's got a great voice, but I'm just not sure how he fits in at the moment. I am eager to see his role develop in future recordings.    So, as I said, a good and occasionally very good -- and VERY heavy -- rock album.
0671004107|5.0|While I have read hundreds of books, I can count one hand the books I have re-read. After recently watching the movie Contact again (one of my favorites!), I went to my library and grabbed the book (first edition) which I hadn't read since I originally bought it. I won't go into detail on the book because many other reviews have performed that function, but I did want to point out a couple of prescient things that Mr. Sagan wrote in the book which was published in 1985.     At the start of chapter 8, Ellie is channel surfing and two shows are mentioned, Lifestyles of the Mass Murderers and You Bet Your Ass. Now, while Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous had been on TV a year or so prior to the publication of the book, I thought Mr. Sagan did a great job of predicting the popularity of reality shows and the fact that Ass is no longer a forbidden word on TV. In fact, Wikipedia tells me that there was a show on The Comedy Network in 2005 called You Bet Your Ass.    In chapter 12 there is mention of \\"robot roving vehicles on Mars\\". While there had been two failed attempts to land rovers on Mars in 1971, it wasn't until 1997 that there was a successful landing. Given the success of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, this comment struck me as much more apropos for 2009 than 1985. Good job Mr. Sagan!
B00004VW35|5.0|Once again Neil Young delivers an album with great song-writing and music.  As the title suggests, this bunch of songs are very country-rock 'n roll similar to his albums Harvest, Comes A Time and American Stars 'N Bars.  Enjoyable listening with toe-tapping and knee-slapping tunes.  A must have album if you like Neil's country side.
0061730327|5.0|This is the most inspirational book I've read in a long time. It's the first person account of a boy in sub-Saharan Africa who discovers a few old textbooks in his local library and uses them to bring electricity to his village. His story by itself is incredible, and Bryan Mealer (the freelance reporter who helped him write it) is a great writer. The pivotal scenes in the book have all the tension and joy of the best fiction - except it isn't fiction.    This book is highly recommended to anybody who can read. My only quibble is you should probably skip the first couple of chapters - I think they are meant to give a theme of the boy's transition from the magic of his tradition to science, but they came up very muddled for me. Starting from Chapter 3 on, I could not put the book down, however.
B0000026J1|5.0|It's always going to be a hard request for any band to head back into the studio & deliver an album that would capture the World after doing so on a previous album. That's exactly what Europe did with 'Out Of This World'. Firstly it's known that John Norum left due to vocalist Joey Tempest's attempt at sending the band into commercial stardom, but by bringing in axe-virtuoso Kee Marcello, the songs slide into a more cleaner, crisper sound, instead of the raw live feel that Norum had shown brilliantly on their first 3 titles. Unfortunately this album would never succeed the way 'The Final Countdown' did, due largely to a lack of promotion, but the 80's Hard Rock prescence is felt in every track, & this is one album that has to be added to any real Hard Rock/Heavy Metal addicts collection. Europe delivered another killer recording, PLAY IT LOUD!!!!!!!!
B002HNA95E|4.0|I've been expecting a new greatest hit album from Madonna for a while--because it is about time for her to release one. When I saw the track list, however, I was a little disappointed, because most of the songs were already featured in \\"the Immaculate Collection\\" and \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 2,\\" while songs like \\"American pie\\" and \\"Give It 2 Me\\" were missing.    Nevertheless, after I had listened to this album, I realized that it was still worth buying. This album includes all the songs that are on \\"the Immaculate Collection\\" except for \\"Rescue Me,\\" but all of them are new mixes then in \\"the Immaculate Collection,\\" while in this album, all those old songs appear as remastered single versions from original records. The only bad thing is that some of the old songs are edited shorter than before because of the limited space on CDs. In addition regarding old songs, \\"Everybody,\\" \\"Burning Up,\\" \\"Dress You Up,\\" and \\"Who's That Girl\\" are available in a Madonna greatest hit album for the first time.    I don't really have too much to say about the songs from this album that came during and after 1990s, but just FYI, the song \\"4 Minutes\\" appeared as an edited version from the CD single, but in its video, it was the album version that was used.    Overall, the sound quality of this album is extremely good: I converted all the songs into MP3s, but they still sound much clearer and louder than MP3s converted from other CDs. Therefore, if you're a Madonna fan, this album should still be in your collection; if not, this is also a good conclusion of her career that you should buy without bothering her other CDs.

B001W79MBI|5.0|Sword of the Stranger is a FANTASTIC anime movie. The story is a little cliche (it's sort of a Japanese vs. Chinese story, with the old Kenshin-style fallen samurai searching for redemption thrown in), but the story works with the artwork and action sequences and everything else as a whole to make something that seems more novel than the story alone would suggest.    The characters are all well-formed and well-acted, and seem much more substantial than the traditional Ninja Scroll-style villain. The little kid, Kotaro, and his dog could have been sickly sweet and too cute for their own good, but they are instead depicted realistically, so they don't derail the entire movie. The fallen samurai with no name is a bit of a Kenshin ripoff, but his interactions with Kotaro and the other characters seem genuine enough and his character arc seems complete and real, so it's forgivable. The main villain, the foreigner working for the Chinese, is suitably terrifying and believably monstrous.     The pacing of the story is just perfect, with an awesome swordplay demonstration by the foreign tough guy to start things off, little tastes of action here and there throughout the middle, and an explosive finale that literally leaves entire armies in piles of bloody chunks. The Chinese influence is definitely there, and if you've seen movies like Once Upon a Time in China or Iron Monkey, the finale especially will seem familiar. It looks and feels like a Hong Kong wuxia film cranked up to 11.    For anyone who likes anime movies like Ninja Scroll or the Samurai X OVA, or Hong Kong wuxia films like Hero or House of Flying Daggers, I can't recommend Sword of the Stranger enough. I haven't seen an example of this genre that's this good in YEARS.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|Thank God for musicians like Rachael Yamagata. In a time when musicians are increasingly selling out to instant gratification and commercial fads, Yamagata insists on expressing herself in the most artistic, individualised, truthful way.    'Elephants', the first CD in this set, is for people who have at least a fairly deep melancholic, introspective side to their nature. The music on this disc is incredibly heavy and lugubrious in mood, and moves at a glacial pace - so you certainly need patience to enjoy it. But this heaviness is beautifully entwined with tenderness, urgency, loss, longing, affinity with nature and love.     It also comes with an amazing artistic exploration of the possibilities of music. Rachael and her musicians do not only create sound; they create soundscapes. The luxurious opening of 'Sunday Afternoon' - with a fascinating orchestra of violin, keyboard, viola, cello and electric guitar - creates a desolate, mysterious planet with shimmering light. That was the vision it created for me - what will it create for you?    'Teeth Sinking into Heart', the 2nd disc, provides an interesting foil to the first with faster, louder, edgier rock. I wasn't so fond of this part, but 'Sidedish Friend' is an interesting, catchy piece on superficial friendship.    So the highlight here for me is the first disc, 'Elephants'. Rachael Yamagata tears your heart into a thousand pieces, and lovingly examines each piece. Surely one of the greatest works of music the world has ever witnessed.
0385504225|2.0|I read The DaVinci Code years after its heyday, found it pretty entertaining, but did not think it lived up to the hype.  I did not read the next book.  I decided to give The Lost Symbol a fair shake.    I thought The Lost Symbol had a creaky plot, with confusing parts and implausible parts the glue and string that held it together, albeit not very well.  It needed more editing, to rein in some of the long-winded exposition parts, and to inject some degree of credibility into the action and pivotal events.  An awful lot happens in about six hours.  When you finally learn what the supposed crisis is, you wonder what the heck is the big deal.      I'm trying not to give away any plot details, but to convey my view that, aside from some of the historical trivia, this book was a bit of a chore to read, and I was glad when it was over.
031606792X|1.0|I really loved the first 3 books of the Twilight series, and had high hopes for Breaking Dawn.  I have read them all twice now, and have to say that I agree with those that wonder if someone else wrote this 4th book.  It just has such a different feel to it...the love story between Edward and Bella is gone and in it's place is the story of a mutant vampire child.  Edward and Bella's once tender and sweet relationship is relegated to mentioning that they have lots of sex during the night while mutant child sleeps.  I also agree with those that think it stinks that Bella didn't have to give up anything once she became a vampire.  Do I also need to mention that I think it's absurd that Jacob imprints on mutant baby?  Creepy.  And suddenly he forgets about his love for Bella and everything is just great.  It feels like such cheap ways to tie up the story.  From this point on, I will stop reading at Eclipse and make up my own ending.  It's much more satisfying that way.    I wish you would write another ending for the series Stephanie Meyer!
0385504225|3.0|[[ASIN:1435708369 Maui H.S.]]The Lost Symbol is all right, but I don't think Dan Brown is such a great author.  His plots move, but this book is a mirror plot of Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Even the characters are mirrored.  A beautiful brilliant female scientist, a tattoed demon instead of an albino, running around a city, DC instead of Rome, and the mirrors go on.  Repetitive phrase to the point of irritating, and flat characters with dull dialogue.  The ending is weak and that is kind.  The ending is boring and nearly stupid.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|It really took a minute to get over the idea that this was \\"Alice In Chains\\" without Layne Staley. For the first few days, I kept thinking to myself \\"I think I would like this more if they renamed the band\\". However, after a couple dozen times through, this album is really growing on me. While I do not think it is on par with what they were able to achieve with Layne Staley, if this was an album released by a \\"newly formed\\" band today, it would be hailed as a \\"return to the great rock albums of old\\".     It just goes to show two things: 1) how truly amazing Alice In Chains and the era of their prominence was, and 2) how appallingly bad Rock is in this current era. This is by no means a bad album, it is actually quite quite good, but no matter how much fans want to clamor that Jerry Cantrell WAS Alice In Chains, there was a reason he was back-up vocalist and not lead singer. Layne Staley was just an exceptional talent, both as a lead vocalist, and as a dark, brooding song writer. I know Cantrell wrote much of the songs, but Layne co-wrote plenty and the collaboration between the two was what I feel made AIC the BEST band of the 90's.     By now I am sold on the album, it is a worthy effort in the name of AIC, and while it can never top what they had with Staley, I am just overjoyed to have another quality Rock effort from, at least 3/4ths, of a band whose \\"death\\" was a great tragedy.     I really enjoy how they proclaim it on the first track \\"All Secrets Known\\", that \\"It is time to start living, as we did before we died\\" and that \\"there is no going back to the place where we started from\\", acknowledging the death of Layne, honoring what he was, and in my estimation, dedicating this to their fallen friend.     From there the album is really consistently good, with standouts like \\"Last of My Kind\\", the single \\"A Looking in View\\", \\"Lesson Learned\\" and \\"Private Hell\\" being my favorites at the moment. The music itself (sans vocals) reminds me a lot of Dirt, very aggressive and moody, and it is what drives the album. I have been hearing the music in my head when I am not listening to the album much moreso than the vocals, but they are good enough to not detract from the overall experience.     In all, I would consider this just a slight notch below Clutch's Strange Cousins From The West as the best rock album I have heard this year. And even though I already said it, I think if they had called the band \\"Formerly Known as Alice In Chains\\" I would have liked the album even more. But being called AIC immediately causes my mind to make comparisons to the Layne Staley years, and this new vocalist, while good, just cannot compete with a legend.    4.5 out of 5 stars
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The famed \\"White Album\\".  It seems somewhat divisive among Beatles fans, some see it as an overlong, bloated piece of work, others as an amazing, eclectic collection of songs.  I fall in with the latter.  It is at times self-indulgent and several of the tracks are just silly wastes of time, and the eight minute \\"Revolution 9\\" is seen as the greatest offender.  It's just a long mishmash of different sounds, voice samples and snippets of things that don't amount to anything approaching actual music.  I might have been bothered by it if half of modern bands didn't do something similar at some point or another, but I just see it as one of many experiments on the album.  There are some genuinely ingenious songs to be found here, and even the less than great ones mesh together with them to create 93 minutes of something pretty brilliant.    It was recorded at a tumultuous time for the band, when they were starting to break apart and begin the transition from a cohesive group into four solo artists.  Ringo quit for a couple weeks, there were disagreements, and entire songs were recorded by a single individual alone in the room.  \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" and \\"Julia\\" are both pretty much solo efforts by Paul and John respectively, and I enjoy both quite a bit (though for very different reasons).  There are so many good tracks to be found, I find myself strongly disagreeing with the notion that it should have been pared down to a single album, with the small caveat that I find the the first disc is a fraction more enjoyable than the second, although that might just be because it has four more opportunities to do something different.    With songs like \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", I become more convinced that George should have had a larger presence with the band, and even Ringo writes something competent, as well as singing the schmaltzy but fun final track.  Some other favorites include the highly referential \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\", the folksy \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", the classic riff of \\"Birthday\\", and surprisingly hectic and dirty \\"Helter Skelter\\".  This still only just begins to scratch the surface of the treasure trove of great music that the White Album is.  I rarely find myself enjoying sitting through double albums, but there's a hardly a dull moment to be found here.

B001QXE0OC|4.0|While I have to admit I am a fan of Selena, I will try to be fair while reviewing this album. I do believe that Selena has an amazing voice, she does struggle sometimes but the voice is there. The album is fun and you will find yourself bobbing your head and maybe a little more. There are a few songs that sound better then others. Some of my favorites are, \\"I Won't Apologize\\", which Miss Selena wrote. This song has an awesome melody and the vocals are pretty good, it also has a good meaning to it. Other favorites are Naturally, and The Way I Loved You. Both of these tracks are pretty good. Now if you like Demi Lovato then you may like the track \\"I Don't Miss You At All\\", this track does have a Demi feel to it which I guess is a given since Selena and Demi are Best Friends. Selena's voice is not that strong on this album and does falter sometimes. But all in all it is a good album and I am happy I purchased it. Selena will grow and she has all the potential to have an amazing voice, I have heard it before. I actually would like to see her cover some of Pat Benatar songs, and The Bangles,\\"Walk Like and Egyptian\\". I say good job Miss Selena Gomez, I will be waiting for your next album.

B002HNA95E|3.0|After thinking on this whole \\"Celebration\\" thing a day or two I have changed my mind regarding the whole idea of it.  My original review is several paragraphs down, so read that if interested. I have come to the conclusion that this whole Celebration thing was a big fat mistake. Madonna was with Warner Bros for well over 25 years.  Just think about that folks.  That is a looong time to with a label and that is a lot of history, a lot of music and ton of videos.  The planning for these releases to me seemed a little rushed and you can definitely tell.  This is what I think should have happened:    Comprehensive and COMPLETE singles collection     *ALL of her singles, US and overseas releases,       remastered. Much like the Ultimate Michael       Jackson box set released a few years back,       complete with alternate mixes of the tracks       *Collectible booklet of lyrics to all songs       *She is the most photographed woman in the       world so why not a swanky collectible booklet       of rare and iconic images    Comprehensive and COMPLETE video and live performance collection     *ALL of her videos, US and overseas releases,       beautifully remastered video and sound       *ALL of her concerts: Virgin Tour, Who's That Girl      World Tour, Blond Ambition Tour, The Girlie Show,      Drowned World Tour, Reinvention Tour, Confessions      Tour and finally the fabulous Sticky & Sweet Tour.      Beautifully remastered picture and sound      (I would go as far as saying a Blu-Ray release but       I'd be happy with DVD)    Bonus Discs with behind the scenes concert and video footage     *Making of featurettes with commentary     *Behind the scenes concert footage     *Behind the scenes footage from music videos     *Interviews spanning her entire career    ALL of the above housed in an extremely swanky, limited edition, well-made collector's box, possibly velvet lined.  Not some crappy, flimsy cardboard box that falls apart after opening it a few times (think theRoyal Box from 1990, but only better), with the understanding that the music and video components could be purchased separately for those who do not wish to own the entire set.      This my friends is what Madonna deserves and it's what the fans deserve as well. It's a crying shame.  All we can do is hope for something like this in the future. My advice is to pass on the Celebration CDs and DVDs.  I sure wish I would have.        ORIGINAL REVIEW    Now in general I have no real complaints about what was chosen to be included in this collection...except for maybe the exclusion of Oh Father, Deeper and Deeper and Jump. Other than that, this collection is pretty spot on. However I am puzzled by some strange re-editing of some already edited and/or remixed tracks.      Here's what I have noticed:    Lucky Star - strange all over the place edit of what sounds like a slightly remixed version    Like A Virgin - The same mix from IC, which I like, but I just hate the fade at the end. Cuts out the great iconic line \\"Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time\\"    Express Yourself - When I popped disc one into the CD player in my car I skipped straight ahead to Express Yourself just to see what mix was used. When I heard that fantastic intro that was used in the video version I almost wet my pants. Could it be? Did they actually include the fabulous FULL 5 minute Shep Pettibone remix on this collection? Yes.....and no.  It is indeed the original Shep mix (not that tweaked, retouched mix from IC) but they have thrown some ODD editing down on this great mix. The middle of the song fugged up by cutting out the bridge that begins just after \\"oh baby ready or not\\". It skips ahead a good minute and moves us straight into the final leg of the song. They almost got it right but some shmendrik got busy in the editing room.     Erotica - They were pushing it on Ghv2 by including the radio edit of Erotica on that collection but after a while it kinda grew on me. The Celebration version goes a few steps further and actually ruins the listening experience for me of this song. The original album cut of Erotica is a dark and sexy ride that shouldn't be tampered with. Someone slap the fool that re-edited the already edited version of this song. Blech!!!    Ray Of Light - Another album cut that shouldn't be tampered with. Radio edit???? Whyyyyyy??     4 Minutes - The concept of a radio edit is understandable. I realize that songs need to be trimmed down for radio play. I'll even as far as saying that some songs benefit from being edited and actually sound better. 4 Minutes is not one of them. And there was a reason for the album version being actually 4 minutes long. This radio edit is a mere 3 minutes long. Thanks for ruining the concept!!    Borderline - While this version is almost the original video remix from back in the day it has a few added effects that kind of annoy me. This sounds a lot like the IC version but there are some subtle differences in the mix. I didn't like the IC version either. How hard would it have been to remaster the original video remix? Side note: Borderline is a perfect example of a song that I feel benefited from being edited down and remixed from it's lengthy album version. One of very few.    When comes to Madonna music I am very big on retaining and preserving the original \\"memory\\" or moment of a song. I remember being first introduced to the Express Yourself video and the fantastic Shep mix that was used. I was completely mesmerized. I remember buying cassette tape of Like A Prayer and being dissappointed that the album version was totally different. That moment was when my passion for cd maxi singles and dj singles was born. All in an effort to recapture an original moment. So, when record companies are putting together collections like this I really do not believe they have the fans' interest at heart. They're just concerned with how much they can cram onto one disc by completely defiling the true nature and form of a particular song (kind of like the HORRIBLE video compression on the Celebration DVD collection).     This CD is great to just pop in and listen to around the house but if you're a die hard fan or on the more serious side and love to immerse yourself in Madonna music, stick to making your own mp3 collections and pass on this.
B00003ZKRM|3.0|Sir John Barbirolli recorded this cycle with his Halle Orchestra not long before his death in 1970. I'm not a particularly big fan of Barbirolli's Sibelius interpretations as I feel they, like Sir Colin Davis, lack a certain fire. For me, Sibelius' music is supposed to be much more grand, fiery, and passionate, but at the same time, it should be very direct. As some reviewers have pointed out, he doesn't always yield the best results and his Halle Orchestra are far from one of my favorite orchestras to listen to. His handling of the tempi are a little slow for me and don't always get the best impact.<br /><br />These are generally good readings, though I thought Symphonies 1-3 received lackluster performances. I mean these are just disappointing to listen to as I have heard so many better performances: Segerstam, Vanska, Berglund, Ashkenazy, and Bernstein. Barbirolli's take on \\"Pohjola's Daughter\\" is one of the worst I've heard. It's not supposed to be that slow! There is just something missing in these performances. I think there's a danger that people get into where they think someone like Barbirolli (or any popular conductor of the past) can do no wrong. This set has been bettered by Segerstam, Vanska, and Berglund. It does come down to personal taste, but I know Sibelius' music quite well and I just don't hear outstanding or 5-star performances. The audio quality is only good. The brass section is very harsh and grating.<br /><br />That said, this set does have a lot of merit and he does get some good performances from the Halle Orchestra, but it's not a first choice for me and I seldom come back to this set and listen to it. Of course, music is subjective, so let your ears be the judges. 3 1/2 stars<br /><br />Here are some links to better Sibelius cycles:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005MIZT Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies & Tone Poems [Box Set]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000CQNVSU Sibelius: Complete Symphonies; Violin Concerto; Finlandia]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005Q450 Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008CLIG Sibelius: The Symphonies; Tone Poems; Violin Concerto [Box Set]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008PW43 Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies]]Sibelius: The Symphonies; Tone Poems; Violin Concerto [Box Set]]]  [[ASIN:B00008PW43 Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies]]
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I have not been inspired to write a review in a while but this outing takes the cake. I have been a fan of this band since about 1998. I felt at that time they were the best thing to come along since Pink Floyd and I have felt that way since. I saw them live in Dallas in 2007 on the Fear of a Blank Planet tour and it was the best performance I have ever seen. That was after almost 30 years of attending concerts. I saw Rush, Queen, Yes, Zeppelin and many more in their heyday in the 70's. These guys top those performances in spades. Mainly because I think they are the first band to come along in decades that have the intelligence to understand what came before them and how much better it was than the current schlok that has been on the musical landscape for decades. Musical artistry has been gradually dumbed down over the past few decades via punk, synth pop , grunge, alternative and indie rock. Those genres have their merits but for people who want more emotion, thought and inventiveness out of music there is no better discovery than Porcupine Tree. I think they have taken everything that has happened in music before and upped the ante, mainly by being intelligent, musically advanced and extremely imaginative. Drummer Gavin Harrison has been voted best progressive rock drummer for the past two years. He also was the drummer for King Crimson on their last tour, not too shabby credentials and well earned accolades for Gavin. He is a machine and way beyond any other percussionist out there.     The Incident is the latest offering from Steven Wilson and crew. This is a 2 disk set that is simply astounding, but that is expected from a band that has the strongest back catalog out there. These guys have waxed more brilliant albums than any act I can think of. Most bands are lucky to put out 5 or 6 great albums, these guys have about 12 I think plus a few great live recordings. The Incident is a 55 minute piece composed of 14 parts, basically songs that each have their own space. The full range of what PT is known for is on display here and I cannot fathom how they could compose this, especially since frontman Steven Wilson has so many outside projects in the works with his other bands Blackfield, No Man,Bass Communion and not to mention his stunning solo debut Insurgentes from earlier this year. The guy is a whiz at song writing , production and all around artistry. This is what sets PT apart from most bands they get compared to like Opeth and Dream Theater. Those bands pale in comparison but share a similar ambitious credo as PT. I think PT is way ahead of all the other ambitious artists like the aforementioned because they know just as much about what not to do as what to do. Mainly I am hinting at the fact that some other bands render otherwise stunning music unlistenable due to really bad vocals and lyrics. Dream Theater REALLY needs a new singer to replace Dennis De Young II and Akerfeldt needs to drop the death vox in favor of his beautiful clean voice. Back to PT,I am so glad that SW sings the way he does, favoring aesthetics, harmonic and melodic creativity over novelty. This is a sign of creative genius and enables new ground to be broken. This band knows how to take you on a ride without being pretentious or boring, which is saying alot when you have a 55 minute piece. With The Incident both disks are brilliant and rewarding and pleasingly there are no bad prog rock vocals to muck things up. I really love prog but most bands really screw up with the vocals ex: Geddy Lee, The Mars Volta (don't know the guy's name but his voice is preposterous), Robert Plant ,Jon Anderson, Mikael Akerfeldt (there is still hope for him), and James Lebraie - unlistenable histronics. Thank you SW for being smart enough to ice the cake of your stunning music with brilliant vocals. Much like Pink Floyd (good vocals) I think once people catch onto Porcupine Tree they will become immortal on the musical strata.      Back to The Incident, I don't wantto go into a song by song type of review. All I can say is that if you like bands like Pink Floyd and King Crimson you seriously need to look into Porcupine Tree. Before I discovered them I long felt like rock music was done and nothing else could be acheived. That was brought on by the fact that rock music throughout the late 80's and 90's was mostly lazy, unimaginative , non melodic and musically inept. I am happy to say that with Porcupine Tree we now have an act on par with Pink Floyd yet with a contemporary and emotionally expansive sound that completely fits the current times.      Do yourself a favor and check these guys out if you are a serious music fan.
B000Q6GURU|5.0|This is a movie that the Academy somehow overlooked.  Not since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" lost Best Picture to a sub-average \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" have I been so perplexed as to \\"what were they thinking?\\".  Black Snake Moan is a cool, sexy movie with a lot of class.  Samuel Jackson finally gets a movie worthy of his talent (best work since \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"The Negotiator\\", and Christina Ricci is worthy of a best actress nod as well.  The story is dark, the music is soulfull, and the movie was at the top of my \\"must own\\" list.
B00005JNJV|3.0|Batman Begins definitely creates a new story line and creative resurrection of the D.C. Comic character. This movie is definitely long due to the fact of the director laying down the foundation of how the character of Batman was originated. The movie starts out with quite a bit of action. The fight scenes are laid out very well and will keep the viewer's attention for definitely the first 30 minutes of the movie. However, the story does tend to drag out and you may find yourself getting bored or letting your mind wonder. Christian Bale is kind of silly for the part due to his lame dialogue and his monotone voice can be quite comical. However his fighting choreography and physical physique makes up for this partially. Although the movie does have sufficient action and suspense and looking over the stretched out plot the movie really lacks a main villain that is familiar to the Batman franchise that a die hard fan can recognize. The movie does feature Scarecrow who is a major villain of Batman if your familiar with the series, however he isn't a major keystone. Despite all of this I still think that if you enjoy Batman as a comic book character or from the previous movies or shows this movie is positively satisfying. It definitely corrects the saga from where the movie series was going from the last two Batman movies after Tim Burton stopped his directing of the series (which was right in the trash can). This movie is very realistic in creating the myth of Batman and doesn't branch out to extreme, but of course it does go a little bit on limb with its fanatic villain's plot, but what do you expect.......its Batman.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I hardly ever write reviews on Amazon.  And I absolutely hate horror movies, zombies, vampires, etc.  But I saw this movie on opening day (today) because the trailers looked so hysterically funny.  I enjoy clever humor (versus slapstick) and this movie had TONS of it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the gore was balanced with a touching story, great acting, excellent soundtrack and some seriously quotable one liners.  I felt like I was on an amusement park ride -- complete with thrills and screams and lots of laughter.  Even shed a tear in the middle!  Fabulous movie worth seeing even if this is not your \\"cup of tea!\\"  Take it from a chick flick fan -- this was well worth it!
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Horror purists might scoff and groan at the CW modern-rock soundtrack and facebook references, but I've never laughed so much at zombies being killed--and yes, I've seen \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\" At its core, like most good zombie flicks, this film is about more than just the end of the world via zombies. It's ultimately about four characters learning how to connect with their own humanity. And if I may channel my inner Kanye for a moment: \\"Look, HANGOVER. I'm happy for your Mike Tyson cameo and ima let you have dat. But ZOMBIELAND had one of the greatest cameos of all time. All time!\\"
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I was rather surprised on actually looking up the information to find out that I'd only seen, as far as I can be sure, 5 films starring Elizabeth Taylor and 4 starring her husband at the time this one was made, Richard Burton.  That and not having a really clear impression of director Mike Nichols' work, nor having read the Edward Albee play on which the film is based or really knowing much about it besides the typical, often derisive comment that it's \\"2 hours of people screaming at each other\\", made me able to watch this film from a position of relative ignorance, which I think made some difference.  What little I had seen with Taylor was mostly forgotten, and what I did remember wasn't so positive - she had struck me as a lightweight with a kind of breathless and vapid air about her; and Burton I remembered also from some of his lesser work and action movies that didn't take a lot of chops.  So I was altogether unprepared...<br /><br />A full moon, clouds moving over it, in sharp black and white.  Dissolve to a pan from treetops down to a distant building, in the dark, in the fall with the leaves blowing, a college campus perhaps, a man and a woman slowly walking towards the camera, then passing behind a tree, another dissolve to an overhead shot, they look like dolls...George (Burton) an Associate Professor of History at an unnamed small college, and Martha (Taylor) his wife, both in their late 40s or so, walking home after an event.  Entering their old two-story house, Martha exclaims, \\"What a dump\\" in an exaggerated tone and then proceeds to badger George to tell her what film it's from.  They banter back and forth, getting progressively more testy; they go upstairs, lie on the bed, and Martha starts singing \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" (to the tune of \\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\\") as they start acting more tenderly; it was all a game, perhaps?<br /><br />Then Martha informs George that she's invited a younger couple over; they were at a faculty party it seems, and Martha had an eye on the young man (George Segal, his character never named) who with his young wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) shows up a few moments later, as both George and Martha are getting more liquored up - and more bitchy with each other.  The young couple comes in, more drinks are poured, the fighting continues, the dialogue intensifies, then dies, then re-ignites, like a fugue, like the wonderful Alex North score which at all times reminds us of the tenderness lying underneath the hostility in a marriage that clearly did not turn out the way either party wanted it to - but is nonetheless the defining, central, impossible-to-give-up element in both lives.  So it continues for two hours, as Martha seduces the young man; as both Martha and George try to outdo each other in ferocity and cruelty, as physical violence seems just around the corner, and a kiss and tears around the next.  And always there is wit, and always there is the drama of wondering how, and if, the younger couple will seek to escape this dark path that lies as an example in front of them; and always there is more and more liquor.<br /><br />There's never a dull moment, never even a merely OK moment in this spectacularly compelling, funny, and heartwrending piece of work.  Haskell Wexler's laserlike sharp, high-contrast photography conveys the shadowy world of noir or crime drama, the underbelly of this tormented couple's lives, but also a fantastic never-never land - a swing out back, the roadhouse down the way, a strange beauty of nightly creation and destruction as George and Martha over and over approach and ultimately reject any kind of lasting understanding of each other, circling like the mobile camera that Nichols directs like a master on only his first film.  North's score I've mentioned, which evokes Bach and Handel, the classical world of George's bookish life, gentle harp and guitar and other strings for the most part, a calmness in the midst of the crazy inner worldsin front of us.<br /><br />But it is the actors who are the reason we're watching this, after all, and none of them disappoint.  Sandy Dennis and George Segal, at the very beginnings of their careers, hold their own as the alternately frightened and excited young couple, he ambivalent about a marriage out of necessity and a wealthy father-in-law, she a secret heavy drinker and apparently full of sickness-inducing guilt, perhaps out of the marriage, perhaps out of other mysterious reasons.  Taylor and Burton, though, are the reasons you're probably watching the film, and they both so far transcend what I knew of them or thought they could do that it was like watching them for the first time.  Taylor was only 33 - at least 15 years too young - when shooting started, and put on 30 pounds, lowered her voice and seemed to have ripped all sweetness out of her manner - except for those rare moments when both Liz, and the Martha as she must have been, are allowed to emerge.  She seems every bit the disillusioned romantic, a last vestige of the pre-feminist era who knows that there is more to life than her husband, but has never found it and doesn't even really know where to look.  She's ferocious, catty, and always angling because she always knows that she's still got it.  Her slight upper-crust accent seems to fade in and out in tune with the role she's playing at that moment - scorned wife, loving wife, angry and profane drunk, would-be-intellectual who can't keep up with her husband, snobby daughter of the college president - and much more.  Burton is, if anything, even more impressive, though perhaps I'm giving him that mostly for having a slightly larger role, and for being in essence the tragic hero - the man who could never be the great scholar that he wanted to be, the political mover in the school that his wife and father-and-law expected, the lover that she wanted, the father...but that would spoil it.<br /><br />Albee's best-known work beside the 1962 play on which this was based may be his slightly earlier absurdist \\"Zoo Story\\", which is on the surface closer to fantasy than VIRGINIA WOOLF; but this film (and I assume the play) skirts the borders of reality throughout it's length, with at least a couple of moments (stories, really) which are never particularly explained and left very much up to us to decipher or interpret.  Is the \\"Bergin\\" story that he tells the young man and that gets repeated later, more drunkenly, more angrily, George's real memory of what a schoolmate went through?  Is it George's own experience?  Is it that of the son\\", apparently made up, that George and Martha could never have? Is it entirely something from his own imagination, but played out with Martha endlessly in different versions, to different couples and with variations on other games, on previous nights, year after year?<br /><br />All good things, all good movies, all bad nights and fantastic nights and hard dark nights of the soul must come to the end, and so does VIRGINIA WOOLF die with a whimper, softly, gently, tenderly....desperately.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES/QUALITY - the transfer on this issue is excellent, soundwise and especially picturewise, beautifully sharp and deep.  Two commentary tracks; I've only listened to about half of the track with director Nichols and accolyte Steven Soderbergh but it's very good; the other features cinematographer Wexler.  Both featurettes on the making of/impact of the film on the second disc are solid; the Taylor TV bio isn't anything special but isn't bad.  Absolutely one of my favorite DVDs.it is the actors who are the reason we're watching this, after all, and none of them disappoint.

B001QOGY72|2.0|This is not so much a film about Woodstock as it is about the behind the scenes happenings that helped create Woodstock. So none of the iconic musical performances are showcased and instead there's an oddly handled \\"coming of age\\" subplot and of course an obligatory acid-trip scene crow-barred in for good measure. As someone born long-after that infamous \\"summer of love,\\" this film felt like it was way too full of inside references and came off more like a tedious nostalgia trip you might overhear your parents or grandparents discussing after too much to drink one night while listening to their vintage LPs. That being said, those few who were actually at Woodstock will likely have a much greater appreciation and enjoyment of this film. The rest of us who'd like to \\"Experience\\" Woodstock can skip this disappointingly forgettable film and just listen to the much more memorable music.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Fans of the band who heard the pre-release tracks \\"A Looking in View\\" and \\"Check My Brain\\" knew that this album would contain much of the signature sound that many bands have imitated since the 1990 \\"Facelift.\\" But I think it would have been hard to predict that the rest of the album would be so uniformly strong. With BGWTB, Alice in Chains have created the kind of crunchy, chainsaw-esque guitar riff-ery not heard since \\"Dirt.\\"     Even if one trusted that it would be good, that didn't necessarily guarantee that it would be as raw, nor as emotional, nor as musically well-rounded as BGWTB proves to be. But make no doubt about it: it's easily their heaviest album, by all definitions of the word. Mike Inez's bass, Sean Kinney's drums, and the now-two-prongued guitar attack of Cantrell and DuVall combine to lay down some of the heaviest riffs in the band's catalog. But more impressive is the emotional content, of a band clearly reeling in the experience of going back into the studio without a beloved member taken too soon and not trying to pretend the void isn't there.    Layne Staley is missed in lyrical content, and the eulogistic title track at the end of the album is impossible to listen to without a lump forming in one's throat. But given the ferocious punch this album packs, one has to imagine that Staley is proud, wherever he may be. If you didn't know what kind of void Alice in Chains left when they disappeared from the musical landscape circa 1999, BGWTB both informs us of what we've been missing and makes us grateful that void is filled again.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|I'm watching this as I write. It is messed up!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't mind gore, you probably won't mind this flick. But if you are squeemish at all, please....don't even attempt to watch this film..<br /><br />At this point I'm watching a girl relocate a body from the shower into the hallway. This is pretty intense. The gore is realistic for sure, no CGI.<br /><br />The gore is top-notch. the storyline isn't bad as I'm watching this flick unfold I wish that the basic story were a little deeper than what is presented. 4 stars for the gore, 2 stars for the acting........otherwise a 3 stars flick. I've seen comparisons to \\"Inside\\", and yeah, while the gore level is about on par, the basic story, while interesting and at times pretty intense, is not on the same level as \\"Inside\\".
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Tim Burton is a visionary genius, there's no doubt about that and he prefers to showcase his vibrant imagination through practical special effects, rather than CGI. He's a rare director that prefers powerful performances and atmosphere over style and with Sweeney Todd, this is his grandest gesture yet.<br /><br />Benjamin Barker is a barber who has a beautiful wife and daughter but is naive. The most powerful judge in all of London city is jealous of barker's life and decides to incriminate him on a false charge. Locked away for 15 years, Barker returns to London with a grim look on his face like that of a ghost and a white streak in his dark hair, here Tim Burton channels The Bride of Frankenstein. Barker calls himself Sweeney Todd and secretly opens another barbershop exactly where he used to live. He overhears that his wife had killed herself and that his daughter had become the judge's ward and grows homicidal with rage. He begins his bloody, murderous mission of developing a popularity, being an expert barber he is now the best barber on Fleet Street, and he slits many throats on the road to having the judge in his chair.<br /><br />Johnny Depp was rightfully nominated for an Oscar because his performance is frighteningly ferocious and he pulls off the Buster Keaton \\"Great Stone Face\\" effectively. Tim Burton's use of blood is similar to that of the blood seen in his previous masterpiece \\"Sleepy Hollow (1999)\\", a slightly faded orangey red and the violence is gruesome in an appropriate Grande Guignol manner.<br /><br />This is a great musical written by Stephen Sondheim, being famous mostly for West Side Story (1961). Tim Burton's traditional (as in old-school) direction and cinematography, and a creepy atmosphere are developed expertly throughout this gruesome and intriguing tale of revenge. This is Burton's greatest masterpiece since Ed Wood (1995) and it stand alongside \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" as a visually grande retelling of classic tales of the creepy and awesome.<br /><br />- Nir S.
630521610X|5.0|I'm sure in this day and age it's appropriate to give \\"Scream\\" less than 5 stars. Plenty of folks will say how \\"unoriginal\\" the movie is, or how it's just a rip-off of a bunch of 80's flicks......and I say Bull***t.<br /><br />\\"Scream\\" jump started the horror movie genre in the 1990's. Without \\"Scream\\" we woudn't have flicks like \\"I Know Whay You Did Last Summer\\" or \\"Urban Legend\\". Without \\"Scream\\" we might not have \\"Inside\\" or \\"Martyrs\\". Sure \\"Scream\\" ushered in the 90's version of slasher flickes, but it also ushered in an era of self referential horror films. Wes Craven was able to poke fun of the genre he helped create....and the \\"Scream\\" audience was in on the joke.<br /><br />So many horror films since \\"Scream\\" have come to rely on the horror converntions set forth in \\"Scream\\" that it actually feels original.<br /><br />\\"Scream\\" is meant to be fun, the cast, and the soundtrack both indicate that this is a fun film, not to be taken too seriously. If you've seen \\"Terror Train\\" or \\"Prom Night\\" or \\"Hell Night\\" than you are the target audience for \\"Scream\\", as an homage to 80's horror, you won't find a better film. It plays on the viewer's recollection of Jamie Lee Curtis' early film work, and updating the horror genre beyond what is found in the latest \\"Halloween\\". If you are a fan of 80's horror this is a must see.
0307266303|5.0|The best running book I have ever read. I was what you would call a dormant runner up until I read this book. I had actually intuitively started running barefoot and had a pair of the Vibram 5 Finger shoes for about a year before I picked this book up. I saw the author speaking about his book on the Daily Show and it sounded like a good read. Needless to say I am preparing for my first marathon in Jan and I am cruising right along with my training calendar. I am also a raw foodist and it seems to be working out awesome up to this point. I did have to add a few more calories to my diet with all the new running.
B000AS4L16|5.0|Shoah, by Claude Lanzman, is best understood, in my opinion (I've watched the entire series three times: something like 27 hours of film), if you read the book, and then, also, consider Ron Rosenbaum's \\"Explaining Hitler.\\" Rosenbaum blasts Lanzman as a sort of elitist who has the ONLY proper view of Hitler: can't explain it. A sacrilige to even try.   Lanzman may have that view, but why individuals who want to learn about the Holocaut experience \\"Shoah,\\" is that it has no footage of the Holocaust taken during the Holocaust. Everything is seen through visits to the places where the Holocaust took place, and, through interviews with those who survived.  The SS man scene is good. I think folks should understand that the more I've delved into the Holocaust (ever since Adolph Eichmann was arrested in 1961 and tried and hanged for his part in that monstrous experience), the more I've come to see that many, many THOUSANDS of SS men, including many who actually were part of the Holocaust machine, or the Gestapo, for instance, not only survived, but never received much penalty by the German government for what they'd done.  In fact, thousands got off fairly lightly. The fact is, for a myriad of reasons, there were many governments, including ours, that didn't push retribution for many Nazi perpetrators.  Since the most ghastly concentration camps were in Poland, much of the film occurs in Poland.  Lanzman compliments a busty Polish lady, who carries on a conversation with him, that illuminates how she came to possess such a nice home that faces out onto a town plaza.   Oh, no, it's not her original house. The house belonged to the Jews who were here, and now ... are gone. The Jews moved out and Poles moved in. We Poles, she said, had no indoor toilets ... we had privvys, out back. The Jews had the money to pay for ornate door frames, and good craftsmanship.  And one man describes how \\"we knew ... the Jews had gold hidden ..\\" and his eyes flash with evil, as he SEES the hidden treasures the Jews had as they vacated their houses, and the treasure hunt by succeeding Poles began.  One thing that I am not sure many folks get is that the resentments Poles had towards Jews weren't all without foundation.  Over the years, I've studied the photos of many Jews leaving their homes in various nations, being marched to a rail line, and looked at how they were dressed. What kinds of apartments or homes they lived in. And in Poland, the complexities of ghettoization and marginalization of Jews into specific crafts and trades, gave them, besides the negative side ... a positive, in that they (the Jews) were able to use their education and insularity to enhance their wealth and assets. The negatives (pogroms, ghettoization, less freedom to hold certain jobs), in Poland, Belorusse, Ukraine, Russia ... were serious. But there were opportunities to be THE silver smith in villages. Or, the notary. Or, doctors. And so, Poles had resentments that were twisted by jealousy of what Jews often HAD, in the way of possessions, that led to a sense that \\"good riddance\\" to Jews, when they'd been herded up by the Nazis and \\"disappeared.\\"  Lanzman shows that Poles knew what was up.  But again, a close reading of how the Germans treated the Poles as \\"untermenschen\\" should also be put in context. Poland was THE most Jewish state in Europe, followed by Russia. There, the shetle Jews were harassed and could not live \\"Beyond The Pale.\\" Envy, jealousy, hatred, feelings of self worth were amplified in Poland, for sure. Lithuania and Latvia, also, were virulently anti-Semitic, as were parts of Hungary and Rumania.  Shoah's interviews with survivors also opens up the understanding that those who survived, as part of sonderkommandos in the gas chambers or crematoriums, may have scrambled over their own fellow Jews, in order to live. There had to be moments when those burning bodies, or herding fellow Jews into gas chambers wanted to tell the truth, and some did, but others wanted to live just one more day. Lanzman makes that clear through interviews with survivors.  Who could say they'd not do some shady things in such circumstances. \\"Shoah\\" is a complex picture, and the impact of millions of dead people (in this case, the Jews), seeps in quickly, and can numb some, to turn away.  The Jews were the most singled out community, but there were literally millions of others the Germans hated and tried to exterminate.  Only the Jews, though, suffered such a blast furnace mentality the Nazis had to rid the world of every single living member of the group.  \\"Shoah\\" is worth watching. Please, try to remember that there were reasons, albeit not necessarily valid ones, for some of the Poles, et al, to feel resentment and anger towards the Jews, and not all were cultivated by Germans.  Anti-Semitism was rampant throughout the world, and even in the U.S., there was not much effort to truly bring up the subject, once we knew what was up.  And we did know. Read many of American novels that came out immediately after WW II and you'll see that anti-Semitism was part of the American landscape, too.  The Polish officer who visited the Warsaw Ghetto DID get out, and go to America,  and try to explain what he'd seen there. Every allied government had it's own anti-Semites who soft peddled such reports as overblown or exaggerations. \\"Shoah\\" could not have happened if there weren't so many people who disliked or hated Jews, throughout the world.  It's no wonder to me that Israel is so truculent about not bending any towards a Palestinian state.  Sadly, that won't work much longer.  Once the last Holocaust survivors are gone, there will be too many people who know nothing about that period, and will only ask: why are the Israelis ghettoizing Palestinians, as they were one ghettoized?  Why are Palestinians in a kind of Middle Eastern apartheid arrangement with Israel, as Jews were in Germany and most of Western and Eastern Europe, by Nazis?  How could THAT happen?knowing what Jews and Israelis know about \\"Shoah?\\"  Do we expect too much of Israelis now?  \\"Shoah\\" won't make it any easier to deal with the present conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It does illustrate why many Israelis are what they are, so far as the Palestinians are concerned. But, Lanzman shows us the complex nature of those who were perpetrated upon, and those who were perpetrators. Not many of the latter will own up to the full truth there.  They, too, are fast disappearing.  There's nothing easy about this horrible period in human history. It's important to understand that only our inner values and moral guidelines will help us if ever confronted by such terrible times, so we can \\"do the right thing,\\" if ever confronted by such horrors.
B001ED7C58|5.0|When I was watching the movie, I told myself, \\"I HAVE to get the soundtrack!\\"  So I toodled on over to Amazon.com and bought it (for a very great price!) and I've listened to it every day since!  I listen to it all day at work and I'm not tired of it!  Great range of music from hard rock to soft melodies.  If you like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!
0312330537|1.0|The first section or so of this book was somewhat engaging. But then it all went downhill rapidly. I got really really tired of the author portraying himself as a martyr and a hero. He wrote as if he was God's gift to India.  All he is, is a petty crook and writing and selling this ridiculous book is yet another way for him to extract money from anyone foolish enough to buy the book. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT support this criminal!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|From the first chord of \\"Uprising\\" until the final fade out at the end of \\"Exogenesis: Symphony Part 3\\", this album is a \\"journey into sound\\" in every sense of the phrase. Muse has delighted their fans for a decade now by never sticking to one sound, and their last album, \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\", made sure that every track gave the listener something new to absorb. This album takes this multi-faceted approach to the next level by incorporating styles of music that I personally thought lost to the rock genre. The symphony at the end is a fantastic blend of modern classical symphonic style (that is not an oxymoron) and Muse's distinctive style of rock.<br /><br />The way this album insists on challenging the listener with a new style with every track, and sometimes within the tracks themselves, reminds me of the early works of bands like Queen, who's style was ever-changing yes always appealing. No track hits this point better than \\"United States of Eurasia\\", which in my opinion, is the masterpiece of this album.<br /><br />Ultimately, the listener is left with an imaginative journey through Muse's creative outputs that few bands in this time could ever hope to compete with. The name of the album, \\"The Resistance\\", is also its running theme, and also its mantra. It certainly resists convention and pushes the envelope for modern music.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I've had my swivel sweeper for about 8 months.  At this point, a fully charged battery lasts about 30 seconds -- no kidding -- before it runs out of juice.  I won't buy another swivel sweeper.
0385504225|2.0|I read both Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Codes. Of the 2 of those I like Angels and Demons best.  Adding Lost Symbol to the mix, it is my least fave of the Dan Brown \\"Trinity\\" of books.      I agree with a lot of the other comments made here-it took way to long to get to the real storyline, it was half way through the book before we got there.  Then once the major story is wrapped up we had another 70 pages or so of fluff that I was asking myself \\"who cares\\"?  This book was too much filler not enough killer.  The actual story hidden inside all of this exposition and uselessness was a pretty good one.    The story was of course the same old Dan Brown formula.  Langdon and a hot female scientist have to save everyone.  I don't fault him for sticking with the formula that works, but he needs to work it over a bit more.  It is like he is filling in the blanks on a template with this one.  Someone else compared him to JK Rowling and the Harry Potter books because they follow a specific formula but do a better job, and I agree. At least in Harry Potter we are carrying forward an entire story arc, we add new characters that reoccur in subsequent novels. We are in fact building upon our knowledge of the wizarding world.  Perhaps if Brown is going to stick w/his cash cow Langdon he could take a page from this style as well.  It might make his books more interesting if I thought there was more to the story to come later.    Anyways, I bought it for $17 and am glad I didn't pay more than that.  The other 2 books I couldn't put down. This one I almost had to force myself to finish.
B001N26GFM|3.0|I loved this movie, the casting was excellent. Although I think they were mainly British actors. The boy who played as the German Commanders was very photogenic and was groomed in the style and dressing of that time period. I liked the realism of the movie. I did not like the continual, daily extermination of the Jews. What got me very disturbed and bummed out about the movie was that the commander's son had been accidentally gassed to death in the showers at the end of the movie (along with several prison inmates). If I had a son or daughter I would never allow them to act in a movie such as this.<br />That is why I gave the movie three stars.
0446677450|5.0|From now on my mentors are going to be only the people who have been successful in whatever I am undertaking. I choose not to listen to another cynic! I read this book in one day. The points it makes, make logical sense without all the usual bull you have to get through in other self-help books. Very well written, with great examples. Once you start you dont want to put the book down. It gives you a new way to look at things. Very thought provoking. This should be taught in our school system, along with the basics.

0439023491|5.0|I picked up Hunger Games because my friend couldn't stop raving about it. Not one for sci-fi novels, I wasn't expecting much, but boy was I wrong! I devoured the whole book in one sitting, unable to stop reading! Of course at the end of it, I couldn't wait for the second novel! But with sequels, I'm always wary, especially if the previous one was flawless. And so I bought Catching Fire with utter excitement and just a bit of nervousness, since Hunger Games had already set such a high standard!!<br /><br />I'm glad to say that Catching Fire was just as good, if not better, than Hunger Games! I was happy to see all my favorite characters, feeling everything that they were going through! Suzanne Collins has a true gift for emerging her readers into the story! I was riveted throughout the story, unable to predict what's next, which was a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />So for whoever is considering getting the book, all I can say it, \\"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\\"
1423101472|3.0|The Last Olympian throws you into the action from the very beginning. There is no running across the country running into nice people that turn into monsters. It's war from page one. I have to admit that I don't enjoy books that are nonstop action with no plot, so thankfully, there was a good amount of plot progression here. We found about about a spy, about Luke's childhood, about a few prophecies, and we got to check in with all of the half bloods that we have come to love. It wasn't all Percy all of the time, which is great. One of my only qualms is that for a serious book with serious subject matter, I never felt the gravity of the situation. People were dying and the world was on the line, yet it happened so fast I barely registered it. I've read books where the description of a fight makes me feel like I'm there, explanations of the moves makes me picture exactly what is going on, and injuries almost make me gag. The fight scenes in The Last Olympian were bland. It was basically he stabbed me, I dodged, I stabbed him, he died. I felt a pretty large disconnect with the characters in this novel that I hadn't felt in the previous installments. One event occurred after another with very few surprises thrown in. There is a war, good guys win, happy ending, that's it. I felt like the series was building up to a grand finale, and I felt like this novel was building to a grand ending, yet the war ended very abruptly. It was very anticlimactic and a bit of a let down. After that, we have 25 pages or so of happy endings and tying lose ends. It just felt half-hearted. I was expecting more drama, more intrigue, and more depth. A good series overall, definitely worth reading, but it fell a bit short of greatness for me.
B000002PH1|5.0|This CD has a good beat to it and takes you back to the late 80's.
1582701709|1.0|This is a book for rationalizing evil people's wrongdoing, especially if it's done by a group.  The author(s) claimed that when some people are mistreating somebody else, that's because they observed that somebody and responded accordingly.  Who the hell are you to pretend a God?  Also they claimed that you can get whatever you WANT if you WANT it, and no matter how big it is.  Who on earth are you to know what you NEED?  This is called fake-Christianity.  Some readers even said that if you believe in God, you should have this book.  Probably you are right, if you need to know what fake-Christianity is.  The US is a typical fake-Christianity and Die Scheinheiligen -- they WANTED to attack Iraq and Afghanistan, even if they don't need to.  They spent 1 hour to destroy Afghanistan, and spent 10 hours to explain and rationalize what they did.  You can claim whatever you want, but only God tells you what you need.  Actually, you don't need this book, if you believe in God.  You have to know what you need, but not what you want.

B001EAWMGA|3.0|I'm surprised this movie got past me. I usually enjoy this sort of thing and this one had been out for some while before it came to my attention. Anyway...after checking out the cast and storyline I rented it as quickly as I could. Many of the user reviews vary from mediocre to tremendous. I guess I fall into the former category.     This is certainly a \\"high concept\\" movie with a really nifty premise. (I won't reiterate the plot as others have already done so) The cast is good. The production values are high but it just misses the mark and that seems to happen mostly at the script level. For instance: The Sophia Myles character goes from a strong dislike of Caviezel's Kainin to a loving admiration way too quickly. A better script would have given the transformation more time and given the audience less of a jolt. The Wulfric \\"king to be\\" character is also poorly painted. We're \\"told\\" he is more than a bit of an oafish brute, but we aren't shown it, so his transformation to a really decent guy as the film progresses doesn't really satisfy.     The CGI effects are uneven. At times the dragon looks really cool and at other times it just doesn't cut it. The direction could have used a bit more pizzazz as well. In concept this movie is up there with 300 or Mutant Chronicles but it lacks the visual appeal of those films. It isn't bad by any means, It just falls short.    This is worth the time spent to view it, but I suppose I'm glad I rented it as opposed to purchasing it because I can visualize this sitting in my library gathering dust.
0743298020|5.0|You might finish a great book or a series and feel there is nothing left. It takes time to get over it, as with any relationship. Some rebound quickly and move on to the next great thing. Some are forced into a new partnership by means of assignments or peer pressure. But some take some time off -  time to reflect, time to rejuvinate, time to focus on other projects - because it's not always easy to jump right back in the saddle. And instead of making an attempt on an unworthy subject, one might just rather be alone and wait patiently for the right book to come along. That book is one that piques your interest and encourages you to begin a new relationship. It's glossy cover seduces you, beckons you to pick it up, and when you open to the first page and begin to read you are immediately entranced. Soon, you are no longer reading the words, but living them out in your mind. You become part of the story, and that other world - those projects that kept you busy while you waited - no longer exists.    This book, for me, was The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield.    The novel begins near the end. A solitary young woman named Margaret Lea lives in a flat above her father's antiquarian bookshop in which she also works. In her free time she pens biographies of dead authors, taking no interest in the living.    One day she receives a summons from a famously reclusive and mysterious author, Vida Winter. Miss Winter has decided that after decades of telling fabricated tales of her background, she is finally ready to tell the truth, and she desires Margaret to document her life story.    Margaret is drawn in to the fantastically eerie, nearly unbelievable truth of Miss Winter's origins, making discoveries that lead her to an unfathomable conclusion. And at the same time she is forced to deal with her own dark past, her own ghosts.    The Thirteenth Tale is a contemporary novel that reads like a classic. If you have ever read or seen a film version of Jane Eyre, Rebecca or Great Expectations, The Thirteenth Tale's haunting account rivals as well as pays homage to these gothic classics. It is beautifully written and utterly captivating. Above all, it is unpredictable - and I do not make this claim lightly, for I am generally very good at figuring out the ending long before it occurs. I would recommend it to anyone who has a passion for stories and a love of old books.

B000EZ7ZZE|3.0|The virus that turned the inhabitants of the Hive into flesh eating zombies has now made it's way through Raccoon City turning the cities inhabitants into...well, flesh eating zombies. The city has been quarantined. No one is able to leave or enter. However, the few that have yet been affected by the virus are not without hope as long as they have Alice.    Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking heroine from the 2002 hit, Resident Evil. She has become stronger and more aware of her abilities. Unfortunately, so has her enemies. Umbrella has released their newest weapon into the city - Nemesis. Nemesis is a hulking abomination that has his eyes set on the S.T.A.R.S team and on Alice.    This movie leaves the confines of the Hive, and takes to the streets of Raccoon City. While the areas are dark and definitely spooky, the suspense is killed by how open they are. One of the biggest draws of Resident Evil was the claustrophobia inducing corridors. The characters never knew what was around the corner, and they had little time to react or maneuver when they found out. You simply never get this feeling with Apocalypse. Suspense has been replaced with action. What you are  left with is a decent action zombie movie with little resembling the Resident Evil tone and mood.    With action playing a greater role, the pacing has quickened quite a bit with frequent explosions, shootouts, and hand to hand combat. I believe more with this movie than any other, Milla secured her title of the \\"Female Arnold Schwarzenegger\\". She really gives the big guy from Austria a run for his money when it comes to being a kick butt action star.     This is nothing really groundbreaking with the special features - commentaries, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc. As usual, the better commentary track comes from the filmmakers rather than the cast.    Picture quality is not bad, but it's not a real looker either. My biggest complaint is with the skewed black levels. Itlooks a bit bright which hurts the contrast in darker scenes of which 98% of the movie is composed of. Colors are generally good, but nothing really pops. It is disappointing, but not necessarily a deal breaker. Sound quality is excellent. With a good surround sound setup, the groans of the undead will put the hair on the back of your neck at attention.    Overall, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not Resident Evil. The suspenseful mystique of the 2002 film has been lost, and replaced with something that more resembles a summer blockbuster. Fans of the Resident Evil universe will still find enough to keep them entertained, but this movie definitely won't change the minds of those on the fence.

The plot is ridiculous, the identity of the \\"bad guy\\" is obvious, the characterization is very weak, and the writing is atrocious. I could not even finish it without skimming through the last 200 pages.  The big revelation at the end is such a letdown!

Anyway, the men want the doll back and will stop at nothing to get it and drive poor Audrey to the brink of insanity!<br /><br />Hepburn plays the role convincingly and the cinematography is really cool. There are moments when there's nothing but pitch-blackness on the screen and so you get a sense of what the main character must be experiencing as she's being terrorized by these thugs!<br /><br />The special features include:<br /><br />Featurette--\\"A Look In The Dark\\"--8:35-minute<br />interview with Alan Arkin, who plays the sadistic \\"Roat,\\" and producer Mel Ferrer, who was married to Hepburn at the time.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer & Warning--<br />warning is a voice-over with text that tells audience members not to light up cigarettes in the movie house (wow, they smoked inside the theater back then!)during the pitch dark scenes so it wouldn't take away from the scene.<br /><br />WAIT UNTIL DARK is a must see for fans of scary movies and of course, Hepburn fans.
B0012OVFHK|3.0|What sounds like a really interesting idea--arranging Tubular Bells for four keyboards--turns out to be a dud.  The ensemble arranged only part I of the piece and recorded it twice, once for two pianos and two synths and the better of the two for four pianos.  Both versions leave off the very end of part I.  Maybe if they released a recording with the entire composition, I would find something rewarding in listening to an otherwise lackluster performance.

0307473465|3.0|Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss about this book is. It's a little better than mediocre. It does read very fast though and would make for a good read on an airplane or over a summer weekend. It's not a book that will stick with me for any amount of time however...
0307266303|5.0|I've been running for 43 years and I thought I knew running but I sure the hell didn't.  One of the best if not THE best book I've ever read and I read voraciously.  This is not just a book on running it's on everything related to running PLUS life itself.  I have to say though the book could of used some maps and for sure some pictures especially on those elusive and reclusive Tarahumara.  Other then that the book was a great story and ran as a great race would be run. I loved it but it's also chock-full of basic true to life advice on running, nutrition and helpful aids to improve a workout a race or just plain life.       I'd highly recommended it to anyone wanting to get some exercise in their life or to prepare for a race or marathon.  Just an over-all motivating and inspiritional book which is hard to put down and keeps you on edge till the very end.
B0011V7P0A|5.0|To me, Tom Petty is one of the most talented people I know.  He is from Gainesville, FL, and I knew him as a boy through teen-age years.  He was a friend of my brother and sister.  I am 68, they are all three the same age, even to the month (October) and year (1950).  Seriously, though, who would have guessed that this little punk kid from our neighborhood would turn out to be what he is today?  He is the greatest in my book.
0385504225|1.0|I'll admit it--I liked Angels and Demons a lot, even liked the Da Vinci Code. Sure they were formulaic and not particularly well-written, but they were fun, full of conspiracy-nut factoids, and had a plot that moved along. The Lost Symbol, on the other hand, is deathly dull and predictable, with a tattooed murderer (yawn) who holds secret information (when you see what it is, DOUBLE yawn) and who wanders around D.C. in makeup and a silk diaper. Robert Langdon is impossibly stupid, regardless of how many times the other characters say \\"Professor Langdon is SO smart.\\" Worst of all, it's about 100 pages too long, because of badly conceived and executed subplots, trips inside each character's stream-of-consciousness, and unnecessary short chapters in which various interchangeable characters will say something about their interchangeable confusion and dread, just so we KNOW they're confused. As if we couldn't tell.<br /><br />IN SHORT: supposedly smart people miss obvious things as they wander around in the basement for six hours. Masons are involved. Read the Bible. The end.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Just the cover of the dvd is enough to grab you attention. The tall leggy female leaning into the guy with the B+w background. I saw the trailer before I ordered the movie online but like some of my other films, the cover would have been enough for me to buy this film. A picture speaks a 1000 words is so very true.<br />I loved the W+B color scheme of the movie. Made it look old and classy. The movie from beginning to end was exciting and the acting was excellent. I'm glad there was no dubbing because a movie like this would never sound good with voice overs in comparison to the beautiful original French language.
B002AOWXO0|4.0|2009 is proving to be a busy year for Pete Yorn, with the release of not one but two CDs in a matter of months: \\"Back and Fourth\\" was his 4th proper solo album, and now comes this duet album with none other than Scarlett Johansson. First things first: this album was recorded in 2006, yes, three years ago. No explanation has been offered why this has been sitting on the shelves for three solid years.<br /><br />As to the album itself, \\"Break Up\\" (9 tracks; 29 min.) brings a collection of musical collages supposedly depicting a break up. Not that you can really pick that up from simply listening to the album. The opener \\"Relator\\" is the most mainstream-sounding song on here, with an easy upbeat rythm to it, and Pete and Scarlett truly dueting. After that charming opener, the tone of the album becomes much more introverted and reflective. I find the tracks that work best are the ones where Pete and Scarlett truly are collaborating, as opposed to the ones where you can bearly hear Scarlett (such as \\"Wear and Tear\\" and the closer \\"Someday\\"). On the other hand \\"I Don't Know What To Do\\" is a great little gem. My favorite track on this collection is \\"Shampoo\\", the perfect mix and interplay between Pete and Scarlett.<br /><br />But at a mere 29 min., there is simply not enough material here to call this album fully fleshed-out. After repeated listening to the album, it simply feels like a fleeting moment, or an incomplete symphony. Much was made last year about Scarlett's singing capabilities when she released her frist solo album (recorded much later than this albu, incidentally). As then, I really find no fault with her singing. In all, for some reason I had huge expectations for this album, and I can't say theu were entirely met. There are nice enough moments on here, but just not enough of them. And did I mention that this collection lasts all of 29 minutes?
B00164KYV4|5.0|Lets face it, with all the technology out there, how can he not find the time to make any contact? He has to be very very busy or obviously he's just not into you, which is usually the true reason. This film I saw at the dollar theater. After seeing it I felt that I would have paid full price at the regular theater b/c the movies was better than i thought. It wasn't just about all these women wining and complaining. It seemed like real life situations. The women who wants to get married, the girl who wants to find the right guy, the cheating husband, and so forth. The movie was enjoyable and with all the different stories that were going on, it was somehow easy to keep track of what was going on. There are good people in this film, from Justin long to Drew Barrymore to Ben Affleck. I never read the book but I'm glad i saw the movie.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|Like most reviewers of Humbug, I am quite delighted by this new Arctic Monkeys effort. It certainly proves to me that the band has staying power. The CD is not particularly long, but you get ten mostly excellent punchy, peppy songs and the great delivery fans have gotten used to. My favorites are: My Propeller, which to me is evocative of 60s \\"underground\\" rock; the driving Crying Lightning; the brief but pounding Potion Approaching; another pounder with Pretty Visitors, and The Jeweller's Hands which I find to be Humbug's most interesting piece.  This CD is a fine collection of songs which should show the listener that rock music still has something new to say after all. Importantly, the booklet that accompanies the CD contains the lyrics. If you are not listening to the Arctic Monkeys, you are missing out.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|\\"Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a f---n' air-o-plane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die'' Lt. Aldo the Apache giving his men a pep talk.    Ok this is hard to write about because its part war movie part drama with a little comedy mixed in for good measure. It starts out in rural france. A farmer has just confessed to hiding Jews to a very persistant Nazi Officer,Hans Landa . Everyone is gunned down except for one Jewish girl,Shoshannah who is smart enough to realize she 'd better just run.  Now the screen moves on to another chapter.( Quentin Tarantino always divides his movies into chapters and makes sure you know what is going on) A group of rag tag looking group of assasins led by Lt. Aldo the Apache ( played by brad pitt who plays a moonshiner who is part of an international scheme to end ww2.    Now that scene closes and Shoshahnah has resurfaced, she has changed her name and owns a movie theatre with her black lover. A nazi soldier forces her to have dinner with him and show a movie he has recently filmed and acted in.Shoshannah is devastated but has no choice. But once she hears all the Nazi warlords and Hitler Himself will be there,she decides to exact revenge for her people.Little does she know that Aldo ,his assasins are going there with the same purpose.     There is alot of blood,They scalp people's heads off & at one point they play baseball with a guys head. There is also alot of choking and bloody battles scenes,but Tarantino always plays really eery music when the really bad scenes come up so you can close your eyes and plug your ears.That was really thoughtful of him.I realize it had to be this way,because war is hell and Tarantino wanted to show this ,so we never repeat what Hitler tried to do again.      Its really funny too. Mike Myers has a really campy part as a British guy(he sounds mini me in Austin Powers) and Christopher Waltz as the creepy Hans Landa is almost cartoonish as the bad guy. He carries this huge pipe and is always saying dumb things like \\"That's a bingo!\\" Brad Pitt's Southern Accent is so cheesy and unrealistic you laugh everytime he opens his mouth.    Bottom Line _The music is great and fits the mood to whatever is going on.It was really bloody so Don't take kids or adults that don't like realistic war movies. I was happy,unlike no country for old men, the bad guys got what they deserved in the end.

B000062XE1|5.0|This collection of Oscar Wilde plays by the BBC just CANNOT be outdone! I've seen the negative comments by other reviewers AND all the productions of 'Earnest' that are cited as being better. What a JOKE! These other productions are slap-schticky and way too farsical. The reviewers who got bored obviously need to have the wittiness and intellectuality bolstered with physical 'gags' and such to hold their interest, although I can't say as I am suprised, since the film version of these plays is probably the only exposure the dissatisfied ilk have ever experienced! Note that the positive reviews are by Educators and the educated. 'Nough said.

B00005JLWN|4.0|Several years ago I dated a girl who had an older brother with an expansive DVD collection. From time to time she would let me borrow some of his DVDs, and one time we watched a science fiction/action movie called Equilibrium. I so thoroughly enjoyed this movie that she bought me a copy of my own, and it quite possibly will go down as one of the crowning hallmarks of our relationship.    Receiving a limited theatrical release on December 6, 2002, Equilibrium is the directorial debut of Kurt Wimmer. Wimmer also wrote the script, and even invented the incredibly unique fighting style on display throughout the movie known as the Gun Kata.     Equilibrium is set in an Orwellian future where human emotion is outlawed. The film fills in the reasons for this drastic step for the audience over the opening credits, but basically after World War III ends humans realize that they cannot afford World War IV. As a means to an end, any sort of content that invokes emotion is outlawed, and the citizens of this new society take designer medication with robot-like precision several times a day to rid themselves of emotion.    Music, movies, television, paintings, and essentially art of any sort are rated \\"EC-10\\" for emotional content (a subtle jab at the MPAA ratings system) and are to be destroyed on sight. In the first scene, police raid the home of a group of resistance fighters and find the original \\"Mona Lisa,\\" which they proceed to incinerate with a flame-thrower.    Christian Bale stars as John Preston, a member of the elite Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton are practitioners of the aforementioned Gun Kata, and their job is to seek out and eradicate sense offenders, as they are called in the film. Bale really shines as he portrays a full range of emotions as Preston. He begins as a cold, emotionless (literally) servant of the state. As the movie progresses his human nature slowly takes over, and he manages to portray the onslaught of emotions quite well.    A good example is the scene when Preston hears music for the first time. Wimmer chose the first movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony for this scene, and its powerful impact is readily apparent on Preston as well as the audience.    The movie has merits other than Bale's performance. The cinematography and music all help to set the proper tone. Taye Diggs and Sean Bean do not disappoint in supporting roles. The action is very tightly knit and well choreographed. On-screen combat is filmed in such a way that viewers can actually see what is happening. Despite some elaborate fight scenes, no wires were used for any of the stunts. This gives the finished product a classic B-movie feel, but this is definitely a good thing in this case.    One of the biggest problems with Equilibrium is a glaring example of unfinished visual effects late in the movie. I understand the movie was made on a budget, but such an oversight is just unacceptable in a major motion picture. There are a few minor plot holes towards the end as well, but these are definitely overshadowed by the technical flaw.    The DVD includes very meager special features, but there are two entertaining commentaries that are full of interesting information. Kurt Wimmer really poured himself into both writing and directing this film, and his passion is apparent even in his commentary track. There is one behind-scenes-featurette that is fun but not outstanding.    Equilibrium is a well-done sci-fi/action movie that is underappreciated. It has drawn comparisons to Gattaca and Blade Runner, but it is in no way a cheap derivative. The Gun Kata is a wholly original form of combat that will offer plenty of awe-inspiring moments. All things considered, this movie is definitely not offensive to the senses.
0385504225|3.0|I will keep it short.  The story is interesting for most of the book, say about 70% of it.  I am not talking about how factually correct things are, just that the flow of the events in the book makes it a good read.  As we get closer to the end this book falls apart a little bit.  Some things appear to be forced to a conclusion vs. offering truly an interesting ending.  Lastly, it also felt like Dan Brown was trying to be nice to the believers and practitioners of Christianity in this book.  The end had way too much debate about the bible, which really felt out of place.

1416550542|3.0|I noticed many reviewers described THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN as \\"satisfying\\".  And if you judge the satisfaction level of a novel by its length and how many plots, characters, themes, settings, time periods, red herrings etc. are jammed into it THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN certainly qualifies as satisfying.    I know the book will appeal to many readers of the romance and historical fiction genres and it is a book that often engaged me as well.     I also at times found the writing tedious and some of the plot elements either stale or unbelievable.    I think a judiciously pruned plotline would result in more satisfaction to most readers.
B002OPYUSM|2.0|Just finished watching the first 3 episodes on Hulu.<br /><br />I loved the premise, going to community college myself, I was really looking forward to this.  Especially with Chevy Chase being cast I came in with high expectations, but left with nothing but frustration.<br /><br />Grading Community on a curve of the modern sitcom--The Office, 30 Rock, Arrested Development all receiving A's--I'd have to give it a D.  (To give more perspective, Parks & Recs would get a C)<br /><br />Community falls into a trap of trying to explain its jokes.<br /><br />Girl: \\"You sneeze like girl\\"<br />Jock: \\"Shut Up, before I pound you like a boy.  Uh, that didn't come out right.\\"<br /><br />Uh, haha, I guess.  Outside of Abid, I can't remember a single characters name, which shows to weakness of the supporting cast.<br /><br />After 3 episodes of The Office or 30 Rock--every bit character was memorable.  Here they feel like time fillers, cutaways.<br /><br />If there's any redeeming clips to Community would be the end credits--whether its Abid and Jock rapping in Spanish or trying to Crunk.  Aside from that spare yourself this trainwreck.
0439023483|5.0|This is a horrifyingly good book, so much so that I had to put it down twice and walk away before I could continue for fear of what would happen next.  In a dystopian future US, there is no bread and one circus, the Hunger Games, in which 24 \\"tributes\\" (forced volunteers) duel to the death on camera with the whole world watching whether they want to or not.<br /><br />The narrator is a 16-year old girl, Katniss, the sole support of her mother and 10-year old sister back home.  Her sister is chosen in the reaping and Katniss volunteers to take her place in the Games.  The plot is like American Idol crossed with Survivor, only in this case children are killing children as a national spectator sport, which is where the horrifying comes in.  By the last page you know what it was like at the Coliseum, from both the cheap seats and the floor of the arena.  A riveting read.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Zombies have become such a great delicacy in the horror genre; they have become almost as malleable and adaptive as the vampire when it comes to genre mixing. We've seen them in horror, action, comedy and even video games. One would argue that the current winner of the zombie comedy crown is either \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" or \\"Fido\\". Director Ruben Fleischer isn't seeking to reinvent the zombie-comedy-splatter fest with \\"ZOMBIELAND\\" but he does get the mechanics and the feel just about right. The film is funny, bloody and full of elements that just screams \\"cult hit\\".<br /><br />After an unknown disease had wiped out most of the world's population that turned ordinary humans into cannibalistic creatures, it leaves only a few living survivors that are barely making ends meet. Among them, is a young man who we shall call \\"Columbus\\" (Jesse Eisenberg) who has set up his own personal set of rules to help him survive the zombie siege. He meets up with a zombie hunter who we shall call \\"Tallahassee\\" (Woody Harrelson) who is just so fearless that he enjoys what he does best--kill zombies while looking for \\"Twinkies\\". The two resolve to travel East hoping to find whatever remains of their homes. On the way, they become hindered by a young woman who we shall call \\"Wichita\\" (Emma Stone) and her sister \\"Little Rock\\" (Abigail Breslin), the two drifters are on their way to visit their beloved theme park in California. The foursome are distrusting at first, but they soon begin to bond and trust each other. This newfound friendship is finally put to the test when zombies lay siege on whatever the four have left.<br /><br />Hell, what is up with zombies these days? I guess one may say there is just nothing more entertaining than watching zombies get blasted to bits. Fleischer is well aware what exactly he is up against here; it would be extremely difficult to get a 100% original zombie movie but he does manage to get the right materials and elements to charm the gorehound (although I was a bit disappointed with the use of CGI in some scenes), thrill the action-horror fan while boosting the gregarious tone of laughs. I would even say that the movie may well be able to win over the non-zombie fan. The movie is just resolute in its aim to entertain and in many ways it does succeed. The movie is just hilarious and kindhearted that even manages to generate its share of shocks.<br /><br />I guess the film's charm would have to come from its two main characters. The movie is being narrated by Columbus and once you see the style with which he breaks down his rules (while being accompanied by on-screen typography) you know exactly what you are in for; Rule #1: Cardio, Rule # 2: Double Tap, rule # 3: Beware of bathrooms and so on. The movie is just fun and narrated by Eisenberg, who sounded very sincere, real and human that it makes the movie easier to connect with. He admits to being a virgin and has a nerdy disposition, the guy is undoubtedly the weakest of the group. The movie is seen through Columbus' point of view and I thought Eisenberg's character gave the movie a feeling of warmth and heart.<br /><br />Tallahassee is the redneck hunter that also has his own set of rules and among them is never become attached and never use real first names; which is why they call themselves though the names of the towns they hail from. Woody Harrelson provides the balance to Eisenberg's character and some needed friction between the two, The movie comes off strong as we see the exchanges between the two but admittedly, Harrelson becomes the film`s main draw. The man is just so funny when he needs to be. Emma Stone is also very charming and sexy as the tough Wichita that I was convinced that Columbus could immediately develop a crush on her. The cast is just good as they develop some dynamic chemistry with their characterization coming in the form of flashbacks.<br /><br />Ok, so just how exactly does the movie perform as a splatter fest? Well, it does perform quite nicely. I know what you are thinking, a zombie comedy has to have several creative kills of the undead, actually Tallahassee and Columbus calls it \\"zombie kill of the week\\"; and you can see that kill in the trailer. The way the zombies are dispatched by our protagonists aren't really that special but when delivered by Tallahassee, with his raw attitude, humor and intensity; it becomes very cool. The zombies in this movie aren't your shambling undead in any of Romero's flicks, but these are the zombies of \\"28 Days Later\\". They are fast-moving and have their own level of minor intelligence.<br /><br />The script by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese is full of zany, jaw-cracking laughs that can back up its cock-eyed heart. The filmmakers freely admitted that this film was inspired by \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and this horror-comedy is done just right. The direction by Fleischer is obviously going for something a little primeval than just funny, and he uses some tricks with the camera (most notably some slow-motion) to express the gory kills. It is effective, when it shows the innocent being tackled by flesh-eating zombies or the zombies' brains being splattered; the scenes are just cool to watch. I also liked his choice in the movie's soundtrack; Metallica's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is so fitting to the film's look and style.<br /><br />Now the movie isn't perfect, as the screenplay reaches its midpoint in the famous celebrity's mansion (who also makes a cameo appearance) it becomes rather too formulaic and predictable.  I have to say that the film lost some of its fun factor when we see the script fall into the usual trappings of \\"young love\\". It didn't exactly hurt the film in a way that can't be recovered, but when it did slow down, it lost some of its comedic footing. I guess its main weakness would be, that while the film generated tons of fun in the form of machine guns, baseball bats, \\"snowballs\\", painting Earnhardt numbers on every stolen vehicle, running down and beating zombies, \\"Zombieland\\" doesn't offer anything very significant in its storyline. I did enjoy the way that the action was taken to a theme park, I thought this was a great way to save the slow points of the film.<br /><br />While \\"Zombieland\\" isn't the best zombie movie out there but it makes the best of what its got. The movie is witty, fun and very enjoyable. It does lose some gas in the halfway point, but Fleischer knew how to treat the material right. I guess it would be safe to say that \\"you don't need any social commentary to make a fun zombie movie\\". The film is just cheerfully bloody and visceral, and Fleischer knows how to make a simple premise work...and work very nicely.<br /><br />Recommended!

1416584072|3.0|I was inspired to read Monica Ali's debut novel Brick Lane, about Bangladeshis in London by my recent trip to Dhaka. It is an interesting novel that explores identity and the women's role in a society that still practices arranged marriages. It has come under attack for portraying some Bengalis as uneducated and backward. It reminds me of the Jhumpa Lahiri books, except instead of middle class academics what we have here is the tenement dwelling underclass in London.
0385504225|2.0|I love all of Dan Browns previous books, and had high hopes for this one! It starts out great & keeps you in suspense like his others, but then he puts in bogus science stuff. Even worse he then injects stupid bible scripture to go along with the bogus science! That's where it nose dived for me. Professor Langdon turns from a real skeptic & scientist to a weak minded believer of anything.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jane Austen, and of course Pride and Prejudice. When I caught part of Lost in Austen on TV, I was extremely enticed. The portrayals of the book's characters are fresh and funny. The differences in the two stories, the book and the story in the movie, are intriguing and exciting! I would recommend this to anyone!!
0385504225|2.0|Even though \\"the sequel\\" took some time before reaching the shelves, it seems that it has been written in a rush. The book is \\"inflated\\" with unnecessary passages that seem lifted straight out of history textbooks, etc. A lot of repetitive elements too: I agree that solving puzzles in between action scenes was the main appeal of The ... Code, but come on, do you really need to put \\"It suddenly became crystal clear...\\" every 20 pages or so before having the main characters chased again?! It is also hard to believe that the good professor and co. solve some of the oldest riddles in human history at the speed of 5-6 minutes/puzzle only to fall into the next lame trap that anyone with a grain of common sense would have avoided even while multitasking.    I will speak for myself (even though a lot critics seem to agree): I have never considered D. Brown a good writer when it comes to his language usage, etc. but he always seemed to deliver a story so good that the unpolished writing style hardly ever mattered. Not this time: the rush to complete the book is so apparent that at times it is insulting.    In all truth, I suspect that it might not even be his (DB) or his editor's fault: we all know that these days books like this one are \\"blockbusters\\" and they are created primarily to generate revenue. This book should be read in this context or it will disappoint. When it is all said and done, I bought it myself, so who is the fool here?    Nevertheless, I find a book that tries to spark interest in visiting your own capital before heading off to Cancun or Paris first, reading the Bible through \\"modern\\" eyes, or entertaining the notion that science and religion both deal with the same subject from different perspectives a lot more enjoyable that most of the garbage that you find on bookstore (or electronic) shelves these days.     Read it and enjoy it, but keep in mind that by doing so you are making your contribution to converting writing/literature into the next \\"specialeffects and no plot\\" money-generating industry. It's a little sad.
0385504225|3.0|At the very core of Dan Brown intrigue is his ability to blend fact and fiction in a way not many others can do well.  He is exceptionally good at it.  He seems to have a formula - whether you love it or hate it.  The general plot revolves around Robert Langdon getting sucked into a world full of symbolic riddles in Washington DC that only he holds the key  to solve. There's a smart, beautiful (emotionally unavailable)woman unknowingly in the center of the excitment.  Also don't forget a disturbed person with unusual physical attributes, who gets the evil ball rolling. And that's Brown's basic formula: Langdon, woman, evil guy, and a couple of folks that could go either way -  all wraped in a symbolic package racing against a proverbial clock.      There is nothing wrong with the formula - it works well.  In fact it offers a fast paced adventure through DC via Masonic symbolism and secrets.  Langdon is exactly the same guy he was in previous installments (consistencey is great). Brown writes this like it's a screen play, which is fine with me, I enjoy the pace and cinematic details.  All and all it's entertaining and you do learn a little more about an under stated scientific study (Noetics) and symbolism.    It would be difficult to say that The Lost Symbol is as original as Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons--- but Brown has knack for this fact bending genre.  However it seems the Masons are a familiar target for movies, books & general conspiract theories in the past several years.       On a side note, I read many other reviews -- why all the \\"haters\\"?  If you don't like Brown's fomula, then don't buy his books.  It looked like there was a race to see who could bash this book first.  No it's not high brow literature, I don't think anyone ever claimed that it was-- Brown writes for entertainment purposes.
