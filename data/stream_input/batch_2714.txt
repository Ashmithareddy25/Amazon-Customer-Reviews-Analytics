B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am not a comic book follower but this movie was great. Robert D. really makes Iron Man amazing in all of his films and the rest of characters are equally amazing. Great movie night movie!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've been playing this game so much more than any other game on my kindle fire hd. I've seen iron man 3 6 times in theaters and its my favorite movie. And I play this game every day. But one thing that I don't like is that on the kindle fire the updates come late. My friend has a I pod touch and he gets the updates before me and I get it around a week later. But this is still my favorite game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game!!! I have trouble with corporal tunnel and it gives my fingers some exercise. Love the fact that I can play with others too !
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is immensely fun. It's part racing, part stock market game. I'd like to see a racing only mode but I still love this. You can see how the game works on the top comment, do just take my word for it and buy the game.
B008CP6RWU|2.0|This game has no plot, it's boring and relatively uneventful. It's crazy how I was drawn to it by reviews, yet, watching several people play it, and throw it aside, has lead me to believe there is nothing really stimulating about this game, unless you're trying to put yourself to sleep or maybe meditate.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Highly addictive!! Great to keep kids occupied and bored adults, I love it and housework keeps getting neglected haha. And it's free which is a mega bonus As well. I have this on the kindle fire
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun to play. I recommended this game for kids who love horses and like pets. So ya.

0345525558|5.0|This debut novel was a difficult read, heart wrenching and quite sad. Victoria is a child in the foster care system, who's become more jaded with each adoption where she is the kid not chosen. Elizabeth comes into her life and it looks like things might change because here's someone who wants her........ but they don't because Elizabeth has some mother issues of her own. When the system releases Victoria at the age 18 she leaves a toxic group home to live independently. She meets Renata from whom she gets a glimpse of what family is and she embarks on a relationship with flowers, an element central to her makeup and really her only means of communication. The journey of motherhood is not an easy one, there's no exam to sit. Is it about conception, birth, suckling, bathing caring, feeding,loving ...... the mystery of it all?!For Victoria the reality of not being wanted by her birth mother does not fit with the picture of someone who does want her and will do almost anything to have and keep her. Yet there is this thread of hope that allows this book to have a redeeming quality despite no happy ending.You long for Victoria to accept the unconditional love that unexpectedly comes into her life but she does not know how. Can she overcome a hard start and create a new life for herself with a family of her own?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesomeness is the word for this app<br />I love this game.everyone I know has this game . I love it
044024613X|5.0|Very well written heartbreaking story that could happen to any family. Every loving parent's instinct is to protect their off-spring and that is just what teenager Jacob's parents do, but in very different ways. The child that they conceived, birth and suckled may well be a monster. The mother tries not to think about it too hard, while dad ..... sure of his son's innocence, he's an assistant district attorney, goes to bat for him. So they try to get on with life and raising this child, though there seems to be some desertion from so-called friends and something is not right with the family. With the feeling that they've dodged a bullet the family is trying to behave normally post defense and the inevitable happens. Only this time the signs are unmistakable, to mom anyway and she does the unthinkable.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love every minute of this season can't believe they can keep you at the edge of the seat every episode.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Much better than the movie - but I had heard that already.  Interesting mix of mythology and juvenile fiction.  Well done!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Very Very  satisfied customer!  I would definitely order from them again.  The product was just as they described, practically brand new for a used price!  I love it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I have downloaded this twice.  It starts out with Level 432 or something like that in the 400s.  What good is that to me?  As advertised it is supposed to include ALL levels.  Deleted it until someone can give some tips on how to get the levels other than the 400s.
030758836X|2.0|It's not that it's not suspenseful, or well written, or even funny, at times.  It's just that it reads like one of those stories that gets Nancy Grace foaming at the mouth.  Wife missing.  Husband probably did it.  If you're the kind of person who gets off on those scandals, you're sure to love this.  Me?  I find it depressing.  And while I'm at it...the relationship between the husband and the wife is poorly developed.  One minute they're in love and the next minute they hate each other.  Given that the whole book is about the unraveling of this relationship, that's a pretty major flaw.  Reminds me of what I already know...stay away from the Bestsellers Lists!!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Unnecessarily confusing pronunciation key. Sparse etymology of entries leaves something to be desired. Overall average reference publication but no Roget`s.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I wanted desperately to love this album. It opens powerfully with Foo Fighters and it is all down hill from there. Only the strength of the material makes the review this high. Stick with the original CCR versions.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's so realistic i feel like i have a real horse! I like to clean and feed her but the time is a little slow! Hopefully i can get her nice and ready for the tournament! I love the graphics and how i can get help and tips! The journal is a good idea really helps you stay on track!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Digital  copy worked very well. The  movie rocked & so did the blu-ray disc. Excelsior! All-around very spectacular! Perfect!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Its nice to view a clean movie. It goes to show that you don't have to be dirty to be funny
B0045EA1P6|4.0|If you like Fun's Some Nights CD, you'll be able to see where their creative juices started. This is a slightly more raw Fun.
0553378384|4.0|We are studying north and south nodes in my Astrology class. This book gives you lots of information and insight. I gave it a 4 because the amount of info is almost too much!
B005H29GSI|2.0|My kids didn't like this. They wound up throwing all of it away except the launcher and the pigs/bricks. Those were short lived entertainment wise as well.<br /><br />Might be great for some, but not mine.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie!  Highly enjoyable entertainment. We have watched this movie several times and still enjoy it.  I would recommend this movie
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I can't blame the adapter as much as the IOS.<br /><br />This adapter will let you copy files to the device but not view them from the card or usb drive. This means copy/use/purge...
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This entire series of TNG is one of the best shows over made for TV. It shows the best of humanity, and I can think of no other series that teaches young people better lessons about being the best they can be, and doing what's right, even when its difficult. Excellent acting and writing, almost every episode is worthy of watching over and over!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app has always worked great for me. I use it to access my desktop browser from my iPad and my android phone. The android app can be quirky when using 4g, but the iPad app is a bit more user friendly with my mifi. Both versions are seamless when on home network.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Shocking, riveting and complex.  This extraordinary novel deserves multiple reads in order to fully follow all the threads of plot and character.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a really good book, although the ending caught me off guard and I'm still not sure that I like that ending.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The delicacy of the floral dictionary contrasts the the harshness of a life lived in foster care.  As the story unfolds, the flowers work their power to heal and reconcile.  Beautifully told.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have to agree with many others about the latest version of the Weather Channel App.  I was in the middle of a vacation 1000 miles from home when the July update took affect and up to that point I had been using it extensively to plan our day sojourns.  When the new version kicked in I immediately did not like it.  It was confusing to get around, and I had difficulty finding and working within my previously saved locations.  Although I did try it for several days because I did not want to reprogram all the locations in to another app, since I've returned home I'll be looking for another weather app.  Better try out your versions more extensively yourself, prior to release!
B006S01GH2|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful foreign films ever!  It doesnt matter if you understand the french language or not, just sit back and be transported by its' beauty.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follet certainly has a formula with these books, but one that works.  I hadn't read Pillars of the Earth in years and certainly didn't remember all the details.  It didn't matter.  Anyone can pick up World without End and right jump into it without having to know the story from Pillars of the Earth.<br /><br />Ken Follet is a master of historical fiction.  The characters and plot are so engrossing, I didn't want to put the book down and was actually sad when the book ended.  I highly recommend it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't normally give feedback on games but I really loved this one and can't wait for more like it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed season 3 as I did the first two seasons. I definitely recommend this series. We watched season 3 in one weekend.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I bought this for my girlfriends 2008 infinite for Pandora streaming and it did not work at all. says it will but nope
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A great story, even if the old language is sometimes difficult to follow. I wish there had been a map of the island included with the Kindle version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game so much its the best game ever it so good for when u go on a trip and it is fun and challangin
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really a fun game - except it freezes in the bonus round?  Completely locks the Kindle up, you have to reboot every time.  This has happened repeatedly, so I know i's a bug.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A nice game which makes lots of fun! And you just got to love the minions! The game is really good for kids as well as for the little kid in every adult!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love listening to Michael Buble' and appreciate that he &#34;covers&#34; so many of the older songs that my parents used to listen to.  He brings them to a new and younger audience also. If you love Michael Buble's style you won't be disappointed with this set of songs. When I buy any of his cd's I always buy two-one for me and one for my mother. This music bridges the generations.
B005D63ICI|4.0|Ok, this brilliant series uncovers the vigilante in all of us, and has had a string of masterfully written programs, but like many other series, it seems to be running its course. Still hooked on it, but a little disappointed that the momentum is slowing by increasingly unbelievable scenarios.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite shows. I love each and every one of the cast. It's fast-paced. It had me hooked from the very first episode. It's interesting but not boring. They make it fun, too. Hope to see this show for many years to come!
B000067FP8|3.0|This was a fun movie. There were a few parts that were not suitable for kids. I let my so watch, but fast forwarded a few parts. He loves Gizmo and the Gremlins.
1439153663|5.0|The story whisks you back to early America when slavery was rampant. Keen insights to the institution come to life through vivid characters and the difficult lives they led. Several themes are weaved throughout so there are no dull moments. I will look forward to more by this author.
B002SHD9E2|3.0|This is a true opera, with almost every single minute devoted to singing. I love the music, but the acting could be better.
B00AEBB89W|1.0|I do not see how this rates four stars.there are only three killings in the whole three hour movie and they happen in the first thirty minutes.the other two and a half hours is boring trash.if your looking for a good thriller,steer away from this.if your thinking about buying it because it has Robert Downy Jr,DO NOT BUY THIS,it is quite possibly his worst role ever.he really doesn't have much of a part.drunken drug headed reporter who dies from his bad habits,the end.zodiac is more a crime/drama than a thriller,and a very bad one at that.dont waste your money like I did.i am going to throw mine in the trash rather than selling  it back so that some poor fool ends up buying it.WORST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN.....  -3stars?
1781162646|5.0|I could not put it down.  Great story.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Why only a 4+?  Only small factor is...not sure what the bonus stones actually do...but who cares...GAME MOVES ALONG NICELY AND PACE OF DIFFICULTY IS BALANCED--unlike a lot of games.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my son who was two months old. He's six months old now, and has yet to let go of it.<br />He plays with the monkey as much as he uses the pacifier. The feet of the monkey have beads in it, he uses it as a teether.<br />My only complaint is that you can't exchange the pacifier, once it breaks or you need a bigger size, you have to buy another one.<br />Over all LOVE IT.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra is just an all time favorite.  Her voice and her music are just timeless, her duets are a statement to her diversity.
B008JFUNYG|1.0|This pathetic and unnecessary \\"reimagining\\" tries too hard to be a \\"serious\\" horror movie, and despite the buckets upon buckets of gore, all they manage to do is bore the audience. The script is tedious, the characters uncompelling (especially the lead character, who has no personality whatsoever), and the director (the same nincompoop who wrote the screenplay) clearly has no idea what he's doing and, what's more, doesn't seem to care. This movie is designed to cash in on the classic original, and nothing else matters. It has no style, no sense of fun, and no energy. It's just dull. Evil Deadly dull.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett at his best!  Complicated plot as usual, but he keeps it moving.  If you've ever wondered WHY the First World War started, this is a good, easy read.
B00499NHLC|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this!  Cast, storyline, soundtrack - everything-perfect!  I love it. Witty, sharp. Great fresh slant on Sherlock Holmes. Brilliant.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Barbara played the perfect Jewish mother and just being a mother to sons I could identify with her antics. Funny parts,it's just that her character was annoying at times and got on my nerves with all her constant talking.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Didn't catch this in the theater, and never thought much of needing to see it.  Was bored one night,  Despicable Me aired on a cable channel, and I decided to give it a try.  And....I LOVED IT!  Such a fun story with such fun characters, and of course, heart.  I told my boyfriend he NEEDED to see it, and he loved it too, saying he was pleasantly surprised.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I reluctantly purchased this movie in a whim.....Lots of action... Surprisingly entertaining. Jamie Foxx and Leonardo Decaprio did a wonderful job with their characters.  They were quite believable.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Love the music. The format and singers excellent. Will watch it over and over. I saw on PBS and this was much more affordable. I  still support PBS.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|LFun game. Good challenge but only took an hour to go through all 10 levels. Need more words to submit so here.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Lots of action in this Book.<br />Lots of Deaths happen too.<br /> Lots of surprises await the reader!!!<br />Can't wait for Book 4.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so entertaining and i love horses!! When i play, the animated horse feels so much like my own REAL horse!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was great to watch abs the quality of the picture was phenomenal. We use Amazon quite often to watch movies and so far we've been satisfied with this service.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is a great game especially for kids and also if you like looking at fish swimming this your game. But they do not give you enough pearls to finish the things you need to do that the game tells you to do
B009X01D9U|4.0|Loved the bright color. kindle fit in perfectly. The strap is great to slip your hand through to hold the device with one hand.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Would've hated working for Steve but enjoyed reading his story and certainly appreciate using his products. Wouldn't be typing this if I didn't!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really liked watching on my computer. So identical to the actual TV production in every detail and loved the series.<br />Now I know what is happening!
B0033UDEX4|5.0|This is one of my favorite sci go series.  A whole town of science experiments & research, what could go wrong?  Watch and see who the scientists and town folks handle it.  Good opening with two new people being introduced thru the town, so the audience can see it through new eyes, without it dragging.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't wait to watch season 3 so I bought the book.  I enjoy the tv series immensely but I find that the books create just as a vivid a picture in my mind and with lots more detail.  I am still going to watch the series mind you, but the books really are a treat.
B0068RGVMK|5.0|Nightwish has only continued to innovate and bring a new level to this craft. This CD is another step higher. I didn't know that you could do anything better than before and yet they have. Fantastic Album! Please buy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was more than I expected! I read all 3 in a row non stop; I don't read it was something I could not put down.
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|Not one of their best albums. Songs are alright but nothing to write home about. If you are a fan, please get it but otherwise, I'd try to listen to it first to make a decision.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I usually hate prequels. They never live up to the originals are often cheap imitations of a well known story that doesn't need telling. This movie fills in the gaps and reveals many aspects of the original story that i found compelling and interesting. The cast is wonderful and the sets are lively and don't over power the visuals of the movie. You connect with the characters and see an underlying story that I never realized could be there.
B000SZH7RQ|5.0|John Lee Hooker with sprinkles!<br />The other positive reviews have really said it so well, I wont try to get all analytical, but this is badass. Canned Heat really let John Lee shine here. What they added really hit the spot and never overpowered. The studio chatter is also cool.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have to admit that this show sat on my watchlist for a very long time. I really had a problem with the concept of a guy whose memory is so perfect that he could pretend to be a lawyer, graduated from Harvard, and another Harvard lawyer would help him get away with it. But... it works. The characters are real enough ti keep you engaged until you forget about the absurdity of the concept. Not that I think this could never happen mind you, in real life that is. Some of the dumbest people i ever met graduated from the best schools in the world. Have you ever heard of George W?  I'm surprised Yale even still exists. Anyway, the show hits all the right marks in that it doesn't take itself too seriously and the supporting characters are as in all good shows... perfect. They stay in character and give the show the necessary twists and turns that all good drama/comedies require to hold ones attention and get absorbed into the cases. I also appreciate that the cases are not minimalized. They appear to be complex enough and real enough to keep things moving.  I've been an advid watcher through each season and hope this show continues for many more years.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series continues to be well-written and fresh, storylines are not worn out and the cast continues to impress as more and more of them begin to turn in more nuanced performances. I hope the series continues for many years to come.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I play games on my fire to esape people and the world at large, so the game constantly wanting me to go onto facebook and play with friends is very annoying. I'm not a facebook guy and I thankfully have very few friends, that are real friends not just numbers on a screen that I've never met and have no real connection to. This isn't for me. If you're one of the millions that think someone who contacts you annonymously and tells you what you want to hear is a friend, than this is right up your alley.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app does not work. I haven't even been able to open and play yet. Disappointing! Glad it's free so i didn't waste money on it. Please fix, and I'll change my review accordingly.
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|The retelling of a classic childrens bedtime tale is tricky, but they pulled it off beautifully. They kept to the original story enough that its familiar but created a new story within itself. I liked it so much, I bought it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I love that my blogs and tumblrs that I followed using Google reader have a new way to get to me and that I can read them with my Kindle Fire. However, until a version comes out to fix the issues, I can't yet give it for stars. It frequently crashes, even in the middle of opening an article. Thankfully, it usually opens up where I left off when I simply restart it.<br />If if were not a free app, I'd give it a worse rating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Starts off pretty easy and gradually gets more challenging. I think that it needs more levels though. I'm enjoying this app!
030746363X|1.0|The \\"diet\\" described in this book is very dangerous. Anyone with a biological predisposition for an eating disorder who attempts this diet of restricting, binging, and purging, is likely to emerge with a deadly mental illness. I was appalled at reading the message of this book. He seems very misinformed.
006178480X|4.0|i love the characters in his novel, also, the places in it. he is such a good writer. i love sigma force.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|have watche at least twice olympus meets the 21th centry and who stole the lightnig from the gods kind of movie
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great book. I'm addicted to all the reacher novels. Once again I'm not disappointed. If you like reacher you'll like this book.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|quite a twist on the childs story it was a little to scary for my 4 y/o granddaughter we watched the preview first to see if it was to scary for her and she had to hide her eyes several times in the trailor but i loved the movie but its not for small children
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The entire album provides great music and lyrics. I am very picky about my music and have been burned by &#34;one hit wonders&#34;; this is not one of them.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|oh typical doting mother who is just a little controling i loved barb the son was way to serious but i guess that was the point i was a little disappointed i think they could have got someone else to play the son
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The ideas driving this movie are beautiful......but no longer novel enough to hold our interest for such a long boring movie. There was nothing new and no \\"aha\\"moments. Too bad, too, because we so much wanted to enjoy it. It was confusing and poorly edited. Halle Barry and Tom Hanks are both pretty bad actors and one comes to that stark realization when they appear together on screen. Skip this movie, unless you are masochistic.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|the free version is so loaded with comercial x outs that it inturups the flow of the game but every one has to try angry birds to see what the fad is all about kind of like austin powers little mimi
B005K17RU0|5.0|We dumped The Weather channel and got this one instead and we love it. We like how easy it is to use and especially that the ads are not annoying.
B001R1PZ9M|5.0|her father watched as a kid everything ninja turtle and so on goes the tradition daughter liked the video and down memory lane for daddy lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really really cool and you can play with all different characters and in all different places it's boss
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|the scenes were beautiful and i thought the story blended well with the origianal wizard of oz as a prequil and i enjoyed it at the theater in 3 d and it was just as good on tv
B009AJD5E0|5.0|remember that Noomi Rapace's character opines that the cave paintings are at least 35,000 years old and we see the Engineer when the world was new at the beginning of the film when he ruins his own dna strands by imbibing evil/seafood dna so it makes sense that earlier missionaries with crashed ships should appear not only in [[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien]] and in [[ASIN:B00D57F7A8 Alien vs. Predator]] and that their home base should be discovered in this film.  In other words, evil has always been with us.<br /><br />This movie takes 81 minutes before it becomes awesome - shoutworthy awesome.  Then the visuals and the surprise are so mindblowing that you don't mind the 81 minutes that you've lost and just love this movie.  They should definitely sell a version that has the first 81 minutes removable.<br /><br />Coincidentally, [[ASIN:B00D57F7A8 Alien vs. Predator]] took 83 minutes to get good.  It seems that the Weyland in Prometheus is the descendant of the Weyland in Aliens vs. Predator.  Charlize Theron has a thankless very small part in this film and Idris Elba has a very fake corny accent.  Noomi Rapace is awful, just this mealy wife until 81 minutes in when she becomes awesome and she is completely forgiven forgotten for her unbelievable obviously younger husband who keeps calling her Babe as if to keep her attention as well as flaunt intimacy to embarrass her so as to keep her off balance and awkward.<br /><br />So this movie kind of sucks for the first 81 minutes and then it blooms into something amazing and hardcore trashtalking if you think it's not a coincidence that Fascist meets Sharktopus Rectum and make an Alien.<br /><br />You have to wonder at the uncredited cameo of shokushu goukan (poor Comfort Women and Joy Division) in this film and the obvious Vril-like excuse by the Weylanders for embarking on this mission.  I think its great that Ridley Scott brings the franchise full circle and expands it emotionally with this film making [[ASIN:B001609SQA Aliens]] more than a movie with clever one-liners and makes it likely that Bishop knocked out Reese, picked up Ripley and Newt LATE because he was picking up an egg sac and not because \\"the platform looked unstable\\" - what does flying away and coming back have to do with that? and infected Ripley in hypersleep with his bottom half missing.  He tells Ripley in [[ASIN:B000QE1U9K Alien 3]] that the Alien was with them the whole time and that the Company knows everything that goes on - just like those black boxes in every Toyota vehicle.  Bishop's declaration about never going to be top notch ever again indicates that he was built to see himself as a real Weyland just like David is the closing thing to a son that Guy Pearce will ever have.<br /><br />German Michael Fassbender (raised in Ireland, summered back in Germany) imitates Peter O' Toole and rewatches Lawrence of Arabia to practice his delivery while his dye job sets in which might be the reason for that incredible false note when he puts his jacket around Noomi Rapacious's character even though he is the cause of her suffering.  VERY STRANGE and obviously a lack in understanding what he is imitating and a failure to watch IRISHMAN Peter O'Toole in [[ASIN:B000NQQ4I8 Rogue Male]] both as David the character and as himself the actor Michael Fassbender - it really makes you wonder why Quentin Tarantino cast him as the Englishman pretending to be German in [[ASIN:B002YCVX5S Inglourious Basterds]].
B0046B1KHG|5.0|this was a cute kids movie that i think adults love too i love those little yellow things and the bad guy turns good daddy was fun a clasic in the making
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I watched this with my 3 year old girls and we all enjoyed it. The soundtrack is nice and it's an all around enjoyable movie. Huge fan of Steve Carrel so I may be biased.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|this has been a fav series of movies have them all fun family fun that doesnt looose its spark worth a second watch
B0091X2K0A|5.0|After seeing so many war movies, this was a refreshing difference.  It starts off and covers the trials and tribulations of basic training and that is the most gripping part of the movie.  The rest of the movie is good too, just not as good.  It is a typical war movie with both sides fighting each other.  Overall I would recommend this movie.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|wasnt what i wanted afterall and i couldnt figure out what it was for i couldnt download anything with it now i cant even remeber what i ordered it for  no loss it was free
1451629192|5.0|I bought this book because  I wanted to be inspired and it did its job.  It got a little difficult for me in some parts so I can only imagine Jaycee living the reality.  This girl is a survivor!  Jaycee Dugard is my hero for sure.  She made it through an impossible, tramautic situation and did not lose her hope.  I pray for a very good life for this remarkable woman and her two daughters.
B0010SEMP0|2.0|After reading (and loving) the first book in The Night Huntress series, I couldn't wait to pick up book number two and get more Cat and Bones.  I purchased One Foot in the Grave right away and read it right away.  I just haven't gotten around to actually reviewing it until now because I disliked it so so much.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into details about why I disliked this book so much because there were so many reasons and partly because I don't want to ruin it for someone who might like it.  Jeaniene Frost does seem to have a huge fan base and I did love Halfway to the Grave so I'm not ready to give up on her yet.  I do plan on reading the next book in the series to see if I can get back some of that Halfway to the Grave magic.
0345529057|5.0|I was looking to buy these books in electronic form but saw this set for about $20 and snagged it right up. This arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. I can't wait to finish them all!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|It is very encouraging to see such insightful and creative talent coming to the forefront of the music industry.  I had not bought any music in a long time.  Finding Gregory Porter was like gold.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I had a tough time with some of it. Other parts I breezed through. I'm looking forward to more! Downside is that it goes fairly quickly... a couple hours. Need more please!
B0093BUWGE|5.0|What a great talent.  For me this was just the total package in vocals, music, lyrics, production - just so creative.  Everythig from the various mixtures of instuments to genre's of music.  Beautiful work.  Very mature.  Love it.
B000KIE11Q|5.0|It's a wonderful watch!! Very very nice and it fits just great for men. Elegant and sport at the same time!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Be Good is a great mucial and lyrical find.  That beautiful voice singing such insighful lyrics is captivating. I just love it.  So soothing and calming.  For anyone who appreciates the arts, they need to pick up this CD.  You will not be disappointed.
B000IZ9UEY|5.0|Possibly Tommy Lee Jones at his best ! This movie covers many elements ; He plays a retired Special Forces instructor, tracker, advisor. The on location footage is great. Also; the action scenes vary but most are long. A tender moment is when he wins the trust of a beautiful, wild wolf, to tend it's injured leg.
B0067Q04AM|4.0|This mixture of music and social commentary was a surprising delight.  It is good to hear the voices of social consciousness are alive.  Enlightmentment without anger is always good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book, can't wait to read the next one. Defe antly a Suzanne Collins fan now and forever
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Awesome book! Can't wait to read the next. Fifty shades darker is a perfect sequel to fifty shades of grey.
0062073192|3.0|The book was great and had plenty of information about the monsters and the boys' childhood and John's feelings about losing Mary and John's interactions with characters from the TV show but some information in the book contradicted the TV show such as Dean - in the journal - graduated from high school, whereas in the TV series, Dean gets his GED. There are others but that is the first one that comes to mind.
B00AEBB8NI|4.0|Stick with this til the end!  Everything eventually ties together.  Afterward, you'll want to watch it again to pick up the subtleties
B002G1YPH0|5.0|all I have to say is I have a AMD FX 8320 Overclocked to 4.4Ghz and this this cools my CPU like a mad man.. when not under load I'm sitting at 35c, at load I haven't seen anything higher than 50-55c. I run a push/pull config on the cooler and man is that a OVERKILL. THE 4 Massive heatpipes really soak in the heat I'm telling ya. I recently started Streaming on Twitch.tv/HypNoTiXz_ all in all this cooler is cool and will always be my cooler of choice.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|If you want a good night sleep than look no further, this is the app for you. I would highly recommend this app for anyone with a android phone
0061122416|5.0|The book was wonderful, I really enjoyed every part of the book. It made me love reading more which I wasn't really into. I'm definatly looking forward to read some other books like this one.
B00B769XB8|5.0|This movie was ausom. Lots of action and good plot. You need to see this in 3d to get the best experience. I would highly recommend this movie.

B006GWO5NE|3.0|It didn't work well on the Kindle I had but it was having trouble anyway so it was graciously replaced
B0062QRTKA|4.0|I like this game and I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a android phone. My son plays with this all the time.
0783225482|5.0|I remember seeing this black comedy flick as a kid in the theatre-and absolutely loving it! Comedic with fantastical elements this movie has you wondering about the irony and travesty of conquering death, and realizing that one must be careful what one asks for!
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Everyone needs this little app. It is cute, but seems to force close alot. I have trouble launching it sometimes as well. Give if a go you might have better luck
0425166805|5.0|my husband always wanted to read it.  Fair price and the shipping was fast.  As always, Amazon is the absolute the greatest.  This is an old book but the main thing is- it makes you think and ask yourself, What If?
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I play this game often when I get bored. My son loves the arcade side of this game to. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes arcade style games.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This was very disappointing from the content and movie its self.  Actors weren't all bad but it had no good story line or a weak one at best.  It took what happened in 3 movies and tried to cram it all in one or at best two.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|My son loves this genie. I still dont get the point of this app, but it was free and my son loves itso why not
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story.  Kept me interested continuously. Characters were well developed and interesting.  Ending was quite the surprise.  Couldn't put it down
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|This crazy little app is kinda cool, my daughter likes to tinker with it. I would have to say it is not my kind of app
1449410243|4.0|I got this for my husband as a stocking stuffer at Christmas.  I can hear him laugh out loud while reading.  That's always satisfying.  It came in perfect condition.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Very nice and beautiful graphics -Kind of a running game, but very unique. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a android phone.

B00C8USQEM|5.0|the most I have laughed in years, every one is worth watching again and again. I highly recommend this set.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|This game is boring slow and dull. My son who is five will not even give it a try. I would not recommend this app to anyone.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I had to go out and get this book after reading the first, and now I am going to rush on to the third. The author has a gift in writing prose with a poetical feel, and it's so fantastic to read.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is a cute and fun flight game, me and my wife play this game all the time. I would recommend this to anyone who has a android phone
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Just filled with action and funny scenes, from the beginning of the movie until the last minute. Stark (Downey Jr) is my favorite.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Not for kids. This is about a teddy bear that swears alot. Not my kinda movie at all. The acting stinks, no real story line, I would not recommend this movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was even better the second time I read it.  It was beautifully written and lovely to read.  One of my favorites
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app lets you control your home computer remotely with very little effort. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs  to gain access to their home computer.
B008Y73940|5.0|Not a movie for children. I did enjoy this movie...not a boring movie.  I am fan of Matthew's so I enjoy everthing movie he makes but this was a completely different side to him.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this app all the time to do basic math problems. The app works good and never force closes. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
1567184855|5.0|This book was very interesting to read to say the least, it opens up a perspective for people to enjoy life and re-evaluate relationships that we currently have, very good.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|I like the game and would recommend this to anyone who has a android phone. My daughter loves this app. It sometimes force closes on me
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|I think it would be a fun app for kids but since I've downloaded it its not working I need an update so that it works properly on my device
B00DU74U74|5.0|You have to watch this movie, it is so good, the acting was great and the romance wss spot on. I plan to buy this one
B00004RLZY|5.0|Fun movie of where the vampires began and how they spread throughout the world.  The film where Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate met.  A silly film, climaxing with a vampire ball.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This is a nice little flight simulator game with a lot of potential. My son likes to play with it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a android phone.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|First of all, I need to point out that I did not attempt to read the book until after I'd seen the movie.. twice. When I finally started reading the book, I soon noticed that the movie and the book are VERY different from each other. I found it too difficult to follow the book, because both the movie and the book are quite complicated, and because of large differences between book and film. I am guessing that if I had read the book first, and loved it, I might not have been so pleased with the film.<br /><br />However..<br /><br />Since I saw the movie first, and was not comparing it to the book.. I liked the movie very very much.<br /><br />I am old enough to remember the latter part of the Cold War, when things seemed less complicated in some ways.. there were the Western powers.. and there was the USSR. Back when I was a kid, so many of the villains on TV shows and in movies were Soviet agents. This movie was made recently, but it sure made me feel nostalgic.<br /><br />It's a period drama, and it is done really well. I'm a fan of British shows that I can watch on PBS and here on Amazon. I like well-acted, well-scripted stories. I like British casts. I like British period drams and mysteries.. so it's no wonder I like this movie.<br /><br />Also.. the cast is awesome.. Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy.. etc. Amazing!<br /><br />This movie is a spy flick that is sort of the antithesis of the James Bond films. I have on occasion enjoyed Bond movies, but I like this film much much better. It's not all whizz-bang crazy stunts, tons of violence, sex, and repeat. No.. this one is slow-paced, very cerebral, understated, and excellent. I hope the sequels will be made someday soon. There are two other books in the Karla trilogy.. \\"The Honourable Schoolboy,\\" and \\"Smiley's People.\\"<br /><br />Since really smart, slow-paced films are not exactly massive box office draws, the sequels might not ever get made.. who knows.<br /><br />But, we DO have this film. I have now seen it three times. I plan on buying it soon, and watching it some more. Yes, it is that good.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.r />But, we DO have this film. I have now seen it three times. I plan on buying it soon, and watching it some more. Yes, it is that good.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. The acting is good, but wow the action is unbeatable in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Such a story as they don't write anymore. No modern vampire fiction equals the original! If you enjoy Gothic tales and Victorian literature, this one is for you.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|just not my cup of tea. My sister just loves this app but it doesn't do much for me, it also force closes alot to.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros: Good feeling when held. Love the dpi, almost too much to be honest but still good. Well built. Best bang for the buck.<br /><br />Cons: I don't like the fact that you can only change the color of the Anker logo but not the color of the scroll wheel or the dpi display. Not that big of a deal and definitely not enough to remove a star.<br /><br />Overall: I really like this mouse and have so far enjoyed it very much. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, reliable gaming mouse.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The first one was better. What I liked about this one was all the cgi computer animation. The girl is also hot too
B0002F6AH0|4.0|In general I liked it a lot and enjoyed all of the DVDs, however, I'm not going to fill my review with repetitious accolades as others have done.  Instead, I'd rather mention a few things that could have made it better, in case the series is ever revised.<br /><br />I think that Jeremy Isaacs mentioned in his interview on the last DVD, that it was a mistake to overdub the foreign language interviewees, instead of using closed captioning and letting us hear their native tongues.  I agree with that bit of self-criticism, but additionally, the entire series should have had closed captioning as an option.  Laurence Olivier was okay as a speaker but many of the English speaking interviewees were either difficult or impossible to understand.  A second complaint that I have was no mention was given to the vast amount of animal suffering; billions of animals were destroyed and many suffered enormously. Domestic and farm animals were killed and brutalized, thousands of zoos destroyed, and millions of acres of wild animal habitat made barren.  Finally, it sickened me to see John McCloy interviewed, with no mention made that he was the individual that freed most of the Nazi war criminals that were sentenced at Nuremberg.  He was able to commit this atrocity because he held the position of U.S. High Commissioner of Germany (probably appointed by Truman), and thus had the power to commute sentences.  He had a vested interest in freeing the Nazis, possibly because he was an anti-Semite, and definitely because it would make him a rich man if he did so. See my review of the book \\"The Nuremberg Trial\\" by Ann & John Tusa for a fuller account of this monster's actions for which he was never called to account.<br /><br />I recommend the series, though it angered me to see Raeder, Doentiz & Speer interviewed--they should have been hung.  The series should have had a segment about the controversy surrounding the light sentences given some of the Nazis.  Also, as I mentioned, the dark side of John McCloy should have been exposed.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Well lets start with this interesting little android app being quite cute but seems to force close alot killing the experience.
B0027MJU00|4.0|It's a dark and graphic story. It sucks you in and makes your skin crawl. Gillian Flynn is a brilliant and twisted author.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Me and my daughter play puzzle games all the time, and this is one of my favorite apps. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a android phone.
1400069807|5.0|Well worth the read. Interesting and educational.  Moss effectively demonstrates how once again big money wins in spite of the evidence of harmful products and ingredients.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I enjoy this game and my son plays it all the time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a android phone.
B0033AGJ5Y|1.0|and the correct version was never sent as a replacement nor have I been reimbursed to date.  not happy at all.  Love this movie, obviously since I attempted to purchase it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I play this game all the time. The game works flawlessly and is very interesting. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a phone
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Love scary movies and this one fits the bil for watching in the dark. Several surprising and startling moments that make you jump!
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|Nothing new here just a pdf to speech app that works soso. I think you should give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cute, cute, cute... love the minions!  Dynamic graphics, loads of fun, can't put the game down.  Laugh like crazy at some of the outcomes.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a nice game for killing time, I play it often. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a android phone. My son loves this to
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am horrible at waking up to alarms so this one is great for me.  You can set it so you have to answer math questions in order to snooze or shut it off, and there are three levels of difficulty when doing this.  It gets the brain working so you have to be conscious to work it, unlike when I could just hit a snooze without realizing it.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I wish there were more shows like this on tv today.  MacGyver is a pimp.  Taking out the bad guys with a stick of gum and hanger.  Beyond Bad ass.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|My Grandaughter loved it as a birthday gift...she dances and sings...smiles an is so happy...as a grandparent notos much but it gets her moving around...
0547978847|3.0|The Little Prince is one of my favorite books, and has been since it was introduced to me by my French teacher in high school, so the poor marks I give here are in no way indicative of the story itself. I gave away my own copy as a gift and was only able to find a new edition with a new translation at the bookstore. This new translation lacks the flavor of the earlier English translation and completely fails to capture the character of the original French text. If you like diet soda this may be the edition for you; otherwise spend some time to track down a used copy of the older translation.
B00821OX98|4.0|Entertaining and heartfelt. I love watching it with my husband. The story line is great and along with the acting.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Great cast. Mr. Franco did great as the powerful Oz. China girl made me cry. Theodora played by Mila Kunis was sexy and evil.<br />The only one that was poorly casted was Bill Cobbs as the master tinker, he nearly ruined the end - can't act.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie really was good. It shows you how the world was so segregated back then and still is in some ways today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I adore this game. Can't stop playing it. It's so easy to play.My four year old son can play it. :) I would definitely recommend this game.
B007SXB498|4.0|Some years ago I read Pride and prejudice by Jane Austen and that's why i wanted to read this book.<br />The style is more or less the same, but I like it.  As  I enjoy most of the books talking about the life style during<br />the 19th century, although from the begining it is predictable what is going to happen. But the description of<br />those characters I like.
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits was a nice surprise.  We found it entertaining and well written.  Looking forward to the rest of the season.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Why put this on here it just takes up Space, it is a waste of time and space I say DELETE IT FROM THE KINDLE FIRE PERMANENTLY
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|why i ask why isn't this app free is because you have to use REAL money for certain upgrades if you are not patient. however during some intense long battles with waves of opponents you can run out of potions and if you don't have gold you have to use REAL money like in DH03... and if you die it cost alot to come back. you will be putting in MORE money than $6.99... I AM SO TIRED OF IN-APP PURCHASE ITEMS AND HOW THE DIFFICULTY PROGRESSES AND PUSHES YOU TO SPEND REAL MONEY TO ADVANCE... STOP RIPPING US OFF GAMELOFT!!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It's an okay game storyline and combat is great but the graphics with the weapons and armor looks like a big blob depending what class
B004EF8AJA|5.0|One of the very best mini series.  Very well acted by Richard Armitage and Daniella Denby-Ashe.  Their on screen chemistry is undeniable.  This series had earned Richard Armitage's stardom in the UK and subsequently world wide with leading roles.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is another relaxing game.  I can watch TV and play during ads.  I'm not concerned how long it takes me.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|...or maybe one of the downstairs staff: I cannot think of another tv series where I've come to &#34;know&#34; the characters almost as if they are real people that I know personally and care about (or in some cases &#34;love to hate!&#34;) as in Downton Abbey.  The development of the characters and story line are incredibly nuanced and have really drawn me in.<br /><br />Occasionally some suspension of incredulity is required, as the writer's efforts (largely successful) to appeal to our modern sensibilities sometimes allow a leaden anachronism to drop with a thud.  And watch out if you are prone to taking sudden, fictional tragedy hard - and don't let yourself get too attached to any of the Crawleys or their underlings.  We've truly been plunged into PTSD for days following some of the dramatic downers Downton delivers from time to time!  But rest assured that these are more than balanced by the sparkling wit of the dialogue, and the many delightful moments when things take a turn for the better in the complex lives of the array of unique characters who dwell within those imposing walls.<br /><br />Even if period dramas don't usually appeal, give DA a try.  The whole family (ages, say, 13 & up) will share in the fun and be talking about it for days afterwards.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has always been a favorite of mine.  This is easily understood and relaxing to play.  Anyone can play it.
B0045HCJG2|5.0|cant get better than this, folks!  buckle up for excitement and super awesome dialogue.  better than tango and/or cash.  get ready for cobra.
B008MEM24S|5.0|a very fun and addicting game, challenging, makes you think to figure things out and keeps you hooked. i recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the my horse game. The graphics are great and all the different activities to do with the horse are fun.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|its a fun game, nice moba for the mobile device, similar to Dota and LoL, but needs a bit more content, runs out of goals and build/champions pretty fast imo
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie brings action, science fiction, love, and a little bit of mystery together to make a star hit among the theatrical world.
B000002KKC|5.0|Yes I have listened to this album before, but it's been a while. A long while. So I recently repurchased this, and played it in my truck. I don't love every track, but they have potential to make that status as I keep playing them. It happens.<br />I own all the FM productions, and listen almost daily, so am one of those. Tusk is simply amazing and I was very young when it was getting mediocre reviews, so I didn't get it. Now I wonder, what were they thinking? It's a treasure chest full of gems! Maybe not polished as they could be, but still better than most of what is on the radio today. Buy, listen, and love music again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I liked it when it wasn't upgraded because I could connect to my brothers game and help him. Now I cant and I want to be able to have my friend help me but there is no way I can. I'm thinking about telling my friends not to bother about getting this app because if we can't help each other than what is the point of getting an upgrade every 3 months. It's not worth it. I have at least 10 friends or more I'm going to tell not to bother but if the company can improve their app in 90 days or less than population of mine craft will down. Most of my other friends who own the app already don't like it and they think the same too. please if the company is reading this than please improve your app.  :(
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Says to upgrade but every time I try it goes to Google n it is for the phone and not the kindle fire HD please fix it
1933492910|5.0|Simply amazing with her way of doing the anatomy study through sketches. No doubt, it's a great book especially for arts students.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I LIKED the way there was no hints allowed. Some levels took a couple of tries to solve, but that's what makes it fun. Looking forward to New levels.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Loved untill new update. Just Ruined It.  Unable to adjust settings~always &quot;on &quot;at top of kindle. Where's doppler?  Alert screen is gone. We are in rural VA and do not have local TV weather.  Big difference from here to DC or Richmond.  Used radar when we had derachio last year and tornado this year and knew exactly where storm was and when to get to shelter.  Please put it back together.  PS love Mike Bettes!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Watched seasons 1-5 on DVD since my family was late becoming aware of this wonderful show.  We just finished watching this season (3) for the third time tonight and it is still outrageously funny.  The humor is incredible and the writing is very witty.  While there is more sex than would be appropriate for younger children, the show appeals to all generations and both genders.  Very, very funny.  There are episodes in this season that are laugh-out-loud hysterical even this third time through.<br /><br />Definitely one to buy so you can enjoy it over and over again.
0425263908|5.0|Really like the series so far.  I can't for the 4th book to come out.  I would recommend these series to a friend.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Reads more like a procedural crime novel than the usual Jack Reacher adventure.<br />If you are a big fan, then you will probably enjoy this one too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved getting to know these characters and following their stories.  I was sorry to finish this book and leave them.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Don't like the witch thing but the game is very addicting!  Colors and graphics are fun.  Waiting on Candy Crush saga Kindle edition
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|it was okay to read.  I felt the characters around Jack Reacher were flat and stereotypical.  But I will probably read another onel
B00000IL29|5.0|I came to appreciate this record late, after listening to a lot of Herbie Hancock from his later years.<br />It is great to listen to, and shows lots of wonderful ideas which Hancock developed later. Will continue listening to it and appreciating the &#34;genius in his early days&#34; before the electronic phase.
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|This is a pocket sized, car charger that is entirely convenient and entirely effective. There isnt really much to tell based on my limited technical expertise, but it does exactly what it purports to do, which is provide simultaneous full speed charging for phones and other USB charged devices. I've used it for phones, Kindle Fires, and even my Vita. Works like a champ.<br /><br />Update (Oct 23). This device has died on me. I think for the $30 asking price, you can reasonably expect the charger to work for more than a few months. I have reduced my rating accordingly. The charger didnt get used daily and didnt suffer from hard use, being dropped, etc...it simply was kept in our glove compartment when not being used. It worked great until one day it just didnt work anymore.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I normally buy a Kanye Album without even listening to anything on it, but this one sucks. Sounds like he's trying to make art instead of music.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|Probably the best of Rankin's recent books.  This is essentially a solid police procedural featuring his long-running anti-hero, John Rebus.  The main plot line is an investigation aimed at finding a previously unrecognized serial killer.  Rebus is a Chandler-style protagonist, a maverick with a compulsion to find truth and establish some form of justice.  This book features some of the other major characters from Ian Rankin's books.  The plotting and quality of writing are solid.
1452113432|5.0|I saw this first at Anthropology, and of course the Amazon price was cheaper.<br />The recipes are delicious, and reminds you of meals you have had in Paris.<br />Would definitely recommend
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Okay all you romantic souls out there.  Buy this and sit down and enjoy it!  Such a lovely Holiday story to put you in the mood of the Christmas spirit!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun to play and it is very cool graphics like the movies. I love playing as a minion on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are so superbly acted. I felt like I was actually watching a real life situation. Preferred watching it as a DVD series - waiting a week to see what life brought them next would have been unbearable.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It was well done for a soap opera.  I had hopes that this was not the case, but I can clearly see that it is not.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Alzheimer's.  My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with the disease when I was in my teens, but she lived halfway across the country and I never saw her health decline.  My paternal grandfather suffered from some dementia when he was in his 90s, but it was never very obvious.<br /><br />Listening to this audiobook was not easy: Alice is a brilliant woman who loses everything about herself.  It's a heartbreaking story and one that I hope I never have to experience.<br /><br />Lisa Genova narrates this audiobook and she does an amazing job.  Not all authors are qualified to read their own works; Genova is a rare exception.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|the tiles are a little small for me. It's a fun game that would be even more fun if you were able to see tiles better
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I have all these boys cds and I don't  think they have peaked out  yet,it's just a matter of time  when they creat a master piece
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would read Gillian Flynn's laundry lists, were she to publish them, the writing in Gone Girl is just that excellent.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Love it<br />Is the most fascinating episodes are ever seen , you don't get sleepy, is to much going on, you don't want to miss a bit
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|Many twists and turns. Chiklis is perfect for this role. I have nothing else to say, since I have only seen 3 episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it its so great I play it every morning now I just love it and Ill get to the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be great, especially for the price! I can't wait for more levels. Some of the levels really stumped me for quite some time, but I actually like games that challenge me to think (gasp)! It is rare to find a good challenging game that is free...keep it coming! I only gave 4 stars because I want more levels!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I saw the Powerslave tour back in 1985.  It has turned out to be the only time that I've seen them live.  Maiden England keeps those memories alive and well.  Up the Irons!  Highly recommended.
1400069742|4.0|Lynne Olson's volume on the conflict between interventionists and opponents of intervention in the years leading up to our entry into World War II is an adequate presentation of both sides of the argument despite its tendency to favor the establshment viewpoint. Those in favor of our entry into the war were concerned with the plight of Britain and its possible fall to Germany while the isolationists were still skeptical our entering into another European war knowing that our campaign in World War I resulted in only a temporary peace with little to show for it afterward.<br /><br />What made me like the book was the revelation of moral failings of those who were on both sides of the issue.  Roosevelt and his allies were vehemently going after opponents of invtervention by doing unconstitutional things like bugging the phones of such people as Charles Lindbergh and Burton Wheeler and allowing Britain to spy on Americans via the British Security Coordination organization.  The isolationists had their failings as well with some holding anti-Semetic viewpoints and were bullying supporters of the war.  In the end, the attack on Pearl Harbor was an occasion where both sides buried the hatchet and advocated total victory.  What is sad though, and the author mentioned this, is that our intervention led directly to what Henry Luce called The American Century where we became an de facto imperial power and became the policeman of the world.  This would come back to haunt us in recent times.<br /><br />The book was well researched with 461 pages of text, end notes, bibliography and an index.  There were some errors though.  In mentioning the Copperheads of the Civil War, the author misindentifies Charles Vallandingham as a senator when in fact he was a Representative from Ohio.  The author also said that Gerald Nye was a senator from South Dakota when in fact he was from North Dakota.  Those things aside, this was an informative book and should be read by those interested in ourhistory just before World War II.  Four stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I kept hearing about it and ended up so hooked I watched all three seasons within a week and a half.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|A good show, but sometimes way too unrealistic. Overall an entertaining show to pass time with a simple plot line.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Unlike long sagas that dry up and leave you bitter (S. Kings, The Gunslinger) this is an &#34;epic&#34; book finally worthy of that word.  Perfect ending to a series I started reading more than a decade ago and have been following.  The entire three book ending capped everything off perfectly just when you were beginning to feel like things were going downhill.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|These &#34;toys&#34; are phenomenal! The level of detail and flexibility/articulation is astounding! I do wish however that their heads didnt come off so easily and a super saiyan 2 head wouldve been nice. And why didnt Goku come with the KAMEHAMEHA but Cell does? After all it is Goku's signature attack. Still though these are the BEST DBZ FIGURES IVE EVER SEEN. wouldn't recommend for young kids though because of all the small parts that would be way too easy to lose. More a collectible than a toy for sure but the ultimate gift for any DBZ fan (if you can afford these crazy-expensive items). Kaioken!!!!!!!
B005J4ASDG|5.0|This album takes the major themes of the entire theatrical trilogy and arranges them in a way that moves elegantly and embodies the movies well. I would highly suggest it for anyone who is a fan of the movie's soundtrack, especially if you do not want to have to purchase three separate CD's for each movie and if you would prefer to have the major themes rather than each soundtrack.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a fun app...and so great that it's free!  can't wait for more rooms!  most of the puzzles either make sense or you can't help but stumble on a clue.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just as good or better than the first.  The show follows almost perfectly.  Wish it would just go on forever
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|This film is incomplete, as it ends before the book does. another squeal coming? The effects are great is the effects of the Lord of the Rings.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great movie , it's one of my favorites- I love the acting and the storyline,  It was very entertaining.  I would watch it again
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This was an excellent movie, very well done and thoroughly enjoyable. Told along the same lines ad the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This is an amazing story of true life American heroes. The story is astounding and the movie captures it well. You can really sense the danger and the emotions. Mel Gibson may be one crazy son-of-a-bitch, but he's a fine actor. As a retired Army sergeant, this film really spoke to me. I wish I had been fortunate enough to have served under such incredible leaders as LTC Moore and CSM Plumley.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|good premise. too infantile. ok for a high school student with nothing better to do.  not as good as Borat, which wasn't great either
B009AMAJVO|1.0|this movie is absolutely horrible bad acting s***ty story doesnt really make sense at all DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found the general premise of the book to be pretty outlandish (children trained as soldiers to fight an alien war), but during the course of it, the reason for that is revealed. My one problem is that, notwithstanding that he's a super genius, the main character, Ender, very rarely behaves like a child - he's more an adult in a child's body. However, the handful of scenes where his innocence and youth betray him are made even more poignant because of this. I was amazed to find out how old this book is, because it has several &#34;futuristic&#34; elements that have already become reality (the internet, laptop computers, interactive video games, etc). I found it impossible to put down once I started it. Also, it has two endings (because Ender actually has two games) and I didn't see either one of them coming. I never would have guessed things would turn out like they did!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This movie has it all for a great horror movie, an attractive lead character, tons of blood and gore more than you probably want to see, and a great storyline that mostly sticks to the original movie. I really think they did a great job of remaking this movie its hard to get through because its very very bloody and gory so dont eat anything during or a couple mins after you watch it lol. i highly recommend this movie to anybody whose seen the original evil dead movies or anybody whose new to the franchise.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works as advertised.  Charges apple products quickly and easily.  I like that is has no distracting light like some other chargers.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|It's good on the first part. But when you get so into it it tells you to buy the rest of the game. The only good part is the sound effects. It sounds scary which really suits the game well. I don't recommend this for you guys  but if you want to try it. Then go ahead I'm not stopping you.
B0053O89KG|5.0|hello,<br />  having just finished the 4th season, we can say that it is a whopper.  great story lines and again, character interaction.  esposito and ryan have larger roles, but the &#34;captain&#34; should warm up as she is a bummer.  castle goes through some tough stuff and comes out ... you will have to see it for yourself.  there are some continuing storylines, so you will have to be up on them to understand.  this one is the best, so far, but can't wait for the season 5 dvd. in september.  great show and great delivery by amazon.  it is an excellent addition to our collection...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ha ha this game is awesome! Only had it for a few minutes but game seems to be a blast!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine.  When I saw it was 800 pages, I wasn't sure I wanted to start it.  But once I did, I couldn't put it down.  I was fascinated.  One of King's best!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It kept me captivated throughout the whole book! Highly recommended. I could not put it down. I can't wait to read book two.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The style seemed different and it felt like we were rushing to the end.  I was not crazy about how everything needed to be wrapped up so quickly, and it still felt incomplete or maybe not fleshed out enough.  I liked the earlier books much better.  Almost felt like there was pressure to get to the conclusion (and get the &#34;last&#34; book out).  I have to say no matter what, I have to respect the fact that Charlaine Harris was able to keep this story going for 13 full books and all the entertaining short stories, some of them were great and written with superb wit!<br />It would be great if it was continued I am sure there is much more to write about, after all Sookie was only in her twenties throughout these &#34;adventures&#34;!  I would wait especially if they were thought out more and written like the older books in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show. I'm dying for season 4 to start, the quality of the streaming was also great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and very few advertisements. There is even multiple person mode. You can even change the backs of the cards.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Sorry this show ended after five years. It was too rushed and when you look at what passes for TV entertainment these days, it is doubly sad that the really popular shows keep getting canned. You do wonder how this town stays afloat with so many strange things happening all the time, but it does. A really fun show!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because the game cannot be moved to an external card.  Took about 80mb.  WTF.  No reason for a game this size should reside on the internal memory.<br /><br />The game itself is really fun to play.  Has lots of levels and missions to keep you going.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I wish you could slow the speed sometimes but otherwise its a really fun game. I love the black Penguin personally.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|If you're downloading this to entertain you, let me stop you there. This game does not contain fun. It gets 1 star only because it doesn't ask for any permissions, otherwise it would get 1 finger. You would probably get more entertsinment value from watching slugs have intercourse.
B00821OX98|4.0|This series is very well written and the special effects are very good as well. They have done an excellent job of interweaving human drama, surrounding the human condition, with the external conflict of an invading alien army.<br /><br />I would recommend this series for both sci-fi lovers and people who gravitate towards dramas.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The writing in this book is outstanding.  I would have given it a five star rating, but it was just a little unsatisfying to me.  I would still recommend it.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Fabulous read.  I've only read two of her books but will be reading as many as I can find.  Great story!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this novel by Moyes. It was my first book by this author and unlike any that I've read by others. Great character development.
B004Q8LDL2|2.0|So...<br /><br />For the longest time I had never seen &#34;The Rock.&#34; I kept on hearing from various people that it was a great action movie to watch and that the soundtrack was awesome, blah blah blah. Obviously, seeing it finally become available on Amazon I decided to give it a go in order to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Let's just say this, if I had watched this movie back when it came out without knowing it was a Michael Bay film, I probably would have liked it as a kid. After all, I did like Armageddon, though I'd be hesitant to watch it again now. Finally seeing The Rock was not worth the wait, so let's get into why you shouldn't be tempted to see this again either.<br /><br />1.) Nicholas Cage is his usual crazy self and over acts the role as is typical Nick Cage fashion. This is not normally a problem, but when he's supposed to be an FBI guy that knows dangerous chemicals. It's hard to take him seriously when he acts all non nonchalant about his role.<br /><br />2.) The typical racist joke is in there. Why did we need to see the scene of a black guy in the trolley going &#34;Oh lord, Oh Jesus!&#34; It didn't make any sense, and the way the scene was shot, everyone on that trolley should have been dead.<br /><br />3.) I love military aircraft and seeing them fly into action. But the way they were used in this movie was lackluster and disappointing. It made me realize that the director definitely has a fancy for the military, but fails to make it look awesome.<br /><br />4.) Ed Harris' motives were understandable, but the scheme was stupid. I couldn't believe that a general would threaten to attack the U.S. with nerve gas missiles, and though he didn't want to in the end, the whole plan just didn't make sense. How was it supposed to work in the first place?<br /><br />5.) The action and the set pieces are boring and formulaic. Basically take anything you've seen from Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, Transformers 1,2,3, Pearl Harbor, and you basically have this movie. It's very one note and not very interesting.<br /><br />I could go on and on, the bottom line is that this movie is: A.) Not worth revisiting if you're feeling nostalgic B.) Not worth your time if you're watching it for the first time. (Unless you like Michael Bay movies, and that's OK, I like some too.)y have this movie. It's very one note and not very interesting.<br /><br />I could go on and on, the bottom line is that this movie is: A.) Not worth revisiting if you're feeling nostalgic B.)

B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed reading this one which set a stage of real life choices. The maturity of both characters grew through out the story.
B005I548B4|4.0|Now this one is cool.  Lots of twists and turns and romance in between.  And an unpredictable ending too which surprised me.  I like that.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|At times I lost tract of the story line. I did read it all and would give it 3 stars.
0440246318|5.0|Had forgotten that I had read this already but read it again and enjoyed it just as much.  Waiting for another book to come out in paperback.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game honestly deserves 5 stars but there are quite a few things I found about it which makes me take away stars for its rating.  Any game I play automatically loses a star for invasive advertising.  This game has ads in it that popup during menus to trick you into clicking them. -1 star. I was also displeased by the in game store.  I understand the need to make money for a game but in this game the values are horrible.  For example: the best deal for buying tokens is 7500 for $50 and just one of the minion costumes is 7000 tokens. Now $50 is what I would pay for full game thrice complex than this.  Now I gave the worst example on the shop you &quot;can&quot; earn tokens in game, but so far I haven't managed to earn more than 3 a day.  Now if i could earn 50-100 a day I wouldn't complain but because I cant... -1 star.<br /><br />My ultimate opinion is that this is a fun game, I wish it had more levels but ultimately this game plays on the popularity of the minions to get people to spend money to advance through it.
B00B69UQJY|2.0|after reading all the reviews I thought it would be better. Unfortunately, many of the songs sound like other DP songs.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Frank is quite the man.  I am sure you will be amazed.  Very interesting history for those of you who want to know about him and his escapades.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Awesome calculation.  Greater than the smiths and after the smiths charmed by the smiths charmed by the smiths to be the first to comment on this morning to pick up the first time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It kept the kids entertained for two hours during our recent road trip.  They were laughing and just enjoying the game.
B000002GWN|5.0|No one does live albums like Joni Mitchell. I've been a fan from the beginning of her career so that will probably color my impressions. I agree with most of the other reviews of Miles of Aisles in terms of the material and the slight changes in editing content for the CD version.<br /><br />What stands out for me with Joni Mitchell recordings is the way they really get the audio experience \\"right\\". This is true for her studio albums but there is so much more control in the studio.<br /><br />Her live albums and especially Miles of Aisles get the right balance of audience ambiance and her playful interaction with them and the band. It's a wonderful accent to the performances. She seems so very at home in concert and that comes through.<br /><br />Technically I have noticed that the stereo imaging (no 5.1 back then!) did an incredible job of painting the stage. If I close my eyes I can place the location of the drums, bass and other instruments as well as Joni. It feels so spacially correct and that adds to my experience greatly and it s very rare on most live recordings. Given the state of the art way back then it's even more amazing.<br /><br />Yup. I love this album and playing it brings me back to a happy time and place.<br /><br />If you like this you might want to try [[ASIN:B000002GXI Shadows & Light]] - another great live album reflecting a later time as Joni moved more from folk like music further into jazz.<br /><br />I hope someone finds this helpful.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I was hoping for more.  The story was good, the only developed character with an arc was Ender.  I needed more.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|I had to use all my patience to make it through this documentary.  I am not the type who can keep watching a movie if the camera keeps moving every 10th of a second, giving me a headache.  The quality is very much amateurish, to expect from kids not from an adult documentary maker.  Besides the very low quality of the movie making, and sometimes abruptly jumping from one scenario to another, I believe that the topic is very much of great interest to mankind and this explains why I averaged out by giving the documentary a 3 stars.  I still think that there was no effort spent to find out if there was any positive or neutral impact of &#34;fracting&#34; beside the financial one, since this has been going on for so many years now.  Will I recommend this documentary for watching?  Definitely yes if you can tolerate a camera that is constantly moving (enough to give me a headache) and blurred images!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle Fire HD!  It tells me when my battery is low, when it's charging, and when it is done charging.  It tell me how much battery life I have left for music, video, and internet use!  I can't say a bad word about this free app!
B002TOJHCM|5.0|This book is very thorough and accurate. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn a variety of Beatle tunes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I devoured the Hunger Games trilogy,  and loved the characters.  The third book Mockingjay did not dissapoint me.  It rounded out the saga of Katniss and her family and friends and as the book progressed I could see the end on the horizon.  I was sorry that I had neared the end of her trials,  but pleased that some finality could be brought to the terrors she had to endure.  I cant say enough good things about these books,  I know I will read them all again soon.<br />Good Luck Katniss,  until we meet again!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Its sad to think that politics and the law are so complicated and lawyers and politicians so corruptible.  It is fun to watch and try to guess what will happen next.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Really would peolpe pleas stop ripping off minecraft and putting a stupid twist to it it really suck that i cant 0 star  this piec of crap
B005PK57IK|4.0|This is a compelling story.  Characters are well drawn and the acting is superb.  I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game! being a rider myself makes me feel like I'm really back in the ring. this is such a realistic game that's great for any age group to enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I had the best time playing with my hourse. The best part is the compositions.you should totally bye this game.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Aliens invade earth.  Typical story, but good characters on show keep story tract interesting.<br />Gruesome-looking aliens could give little kids nightmares.  Hints abound about why aliens came,<br />where are they at any given time, and who are they really.  Look forward to more seasons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is quite an interesting season for me. It tells a story of how to manage the family as the business and how the family is facing the new world. It is a transitional season and it offer everything which makes Dowton Abbey a global hit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun addicting game just wish there were more rooms was fun trying figure out all the combinations to get out of the rooms
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Memoirs are not my typical genre.  However, this was recommended to me by a friend and I am very glad I took her suggestion. This is one of those book that will stick in my mind for a good long while.  After reading I have to admit I was compelled to do some internet research on this author because I just had to know what became of her after the PCT hike. Very interesting read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This product was as described and has given me pleasure reading it on my ipad.  Thanks for a good purchase.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, I love puzzle games.  The graphics are excellent, as well the animations. Only had to restart once on my kindle hd.  I do wish it was a tad bit longer, but for 2 bucks it was well worth it.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|I love Twitch! I watch it on my desktop, laptop, phone, and now tablet. I love to watch my favorite pro players stream, major competitions (MLG, Dreamhack, etc), amateur players having fun, or other geekery (San Diego ComicCon, BlizzCon, etc.). I also enjoy streaming myself from time to time when I'm at home and Twitch allows me to announce my stream and interact with my viewers or my favorite players.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This games Fun and intertaining. Would like more levels though, my son and my husband both enjoyed this game also
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I ordered this because I needed a longer cord in order to charge my Kindle and still be able to use it while charging. This worked perfectly! No waiting for the Kindle to charge before using. Just what I needed.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|got charged for it but could not watch it, was on the phone with amazon prime and odered it to see if it would work but it did not.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Watch for the fun of it, not Oscar material but good entertainment for an evening....The Hulk taking out Loki scene pretty funny....\\"puny god\\"...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast pace , exciting, believable, and fun fun read. Can't wait for the next book to be available. Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. the different challenges and stuff or awesome and the change of scenery. I hope to see other minion games develop
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read! Keeps you interested! Can't wait till the next one comes out, to find out what happens next! Would recommend to anyone looking for a great, sizzling hot series to read!
B008220BP2|5.0|Love this book and the movie was great!  Read the book first then see the movie it will crack you up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game! it helps with understanding horses and the jobs that come with taking care of a horse. i love this app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I truly enjoyed solving every level. I am looking forward to new levels being released. Thank you for such a fun game.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It's boring  and it has a big support taste omg no Boring jking it is fun. Making a world lol
B000003S5G|5.0|What can we say about this album? French touch, hype for his release date. But in the 2013 still keep his charm. My favorite tracks: &#34;Sexy boy&#34;, &#34;All I need&#34; (with Beth Hirsht, adorable), &#34;Kelly watch the star&#34;, &#34;Remember&#34; or &#34;You make it easy&#34;.<br />There's nothing more to say: this is a classic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to see and use!! I suggest everyone use this app!! Great for home, office and on the go. It`s great app all the way around.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I drive for a living so this allows me to save data charges by downloading media over Wi-Fi. In addition it allows you to use play as music. I use the Pioneer Appradio 3 and this works great with it.<br /><br />This app is easy to use, refined, and works well on HTC DNA
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I read other reviews before downloading Chimpact and have to admit it's addictive fun with good graphics and sound effects.  Very challenging and enchanting with kids.
B002WBI05C|5.0|Pitchfork wasn't wrong when they gave it one of their illustrious 10/10 reviews. Whether you've listened to spiritualized before or this is your first time, you won't be disappointed
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great puzzle game. Very challenging. Good for the whole family's from ages 5 to 50! Looking forward to the next one.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This album is a joke.  I make music and this sounds like my off day...wait....very off day, off night efforts.  Im insulted by this.  I gave it a few spins and became further insulted, enraged even.  At one point I forgot I left it on as I cleaned the crib and began to grow frustrated at the most simplest of tasks.  I snapped at my vacuum cleaner and for some reason was very tempted to kick my cat.  I froze.  It was at this point when i realized Yeezus was still playing somewhere and was driving me mad.  I stopped the music and the room brightened, clouds parted, birds chirped.  I was a free man, released from the prison of kanyes production.  No.  I am no Kanye lover.  I like some of his joints.  I have all of his albums.  I never believed Kanye could rhyme well, but he could hang in there.  Yeezus is comedic.  Hilarious.  Why didnt someone stop this fella in the studio?  Buncha yes men.  Black Skinhead and New Slaves are NOT good.  These two songs serve as the life preserver to the rest of the worldly reviews of this album.  However I am completely offended by both of em.  Please dont let the convoluted lyrics in these two tracks even begin to be perceived as a MESSAGE.  As a black man, Kanye aint speaking for me.  Not like that he aint.  He destroyed \\"Strange Fruit\\", debased his baby mama, and his mama, shotgunned asian women, pretty much all women and lastly destroyed my calm.  There is no moral compass here.  If they put this album in a space capsule and blasted it off into the universe some alien would find this and seek to annihilate this planet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app for all Despicable Me fans. I am a big fan of gameloft games and this one just caught my eye. Is it awesome? Decide for yourself. 5 stars!
B0081336FO|5.0|Watched it all and loved it all.  Can't wait for season three!  Great acting, directing, and writing (most of all in my opinion).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love everything from the music to the costumes to the entire story. Amazing! Can I wait until January for season four? NO but I guess that I have to!!

B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Just paid for this with a deadline of 48 hours to watch movie but adobe flash media player does not work. We all know how easy it is to get a hold of amazon to fix things so I am incline to never buy another movie from here again. So be careful when you pay before knowing you need software that never works or you have to download crap to get the software.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|It is almost the definition of a black comedy. It is at once a very funny movie and a commentary on the insanity of nuclear deterrence. Peter Sellers is suberb as well are the many other actors. I strongly recommend you see this movie if you haven't already.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a show that grabs their attention from the beginning and keeps them on the edge of their seat through to the end. Every season, every show did this for me. Never a disappointment.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|The blend of comedy and suspense in this movie makes it one of the best ever. This seems to be the movie that Cary Grant was meant to play. He is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent. The scene at the bus stop in rural Indiana is one of the best ever filmed. Add to that the excellent score by Bernard Herrmann and you have a classic. I can't recommend it enough

B0064X7FVE|3.0|Perhaps the issue is kindlefire. I don't see the great 10 day forecast including the percent chance of precipitation in a vertical list. I see it horizontally in round bubble things that include temperature highs &amp; lows but not the chance of precipitation.  Every once in a while I see the vertical list and as far as I know I'm not doing anything differently. It is most annoying &amp; am VERY unhappy with the update. I hope this is a glitch that will be corrected. I am a weather channel fan for a long time and quite disappointed with the change.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Not a bad movie, just a bit disappointed that most of the funny parts were already seen in the preview.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am fascinated with JFK but only read 1 book from King. I decided to download it onto my new Kindle for ease since its such a big book. I have read tons of things but seriously this is one of the best books I have ever read of any genre. The characters were so rich and the emotions described so vivid that I laughed out loud and at times wiped away a few tears. I highly recommend this great book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched 3 seasons straight through. Couldn't stop. Love the characters. Don't wat h if you don't want to see main cast characters leave suddenly!
B00006AW63|1.0|The DVD I received was unreadable when I tried to use it. It gave an error message of wrong zone or something like that. Total waste of money.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Great app except there are no controls for seeking through your recordings. You have to touch the little bar and it can be difficult to find a particular track especially on a longer recording. Great selection of radio stations and programs. Also you cant export the recordings into a different music player.  Stream getter pro automatically seperates each track and includes track name and artist, but does not have nearly as good of a selection of stations.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Love the series, the shipping was fast, but this is advertised as a box set, and it is just the three individual DVD's sold together.  No extra material no actual box, very disappointing.
B00122HW92|5.0|This is a more mature set of music, i do remember the first release of all of these songs as i purchased the vinyl albums when they were newly minted. Yes, i played the grooves off the record and tried to learn the guitar parts down to the pick sounds. Of course, ssoyl was played by every garage band on the planet, and mine too.<br /> This must have been a fun concert to go to. They sound very loose and not stressed out by playing at this venue. Well, they do know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall!
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|For what I believe is the 6th attempt to put F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby on the screen, director Baz Luhrmann's adaption brings the novel to life in a novel way. Many will love the razz pizzazz of Baz-Jazz and hate the 1920's soap opera-like scenes. Others will appreciate the reverent tone of Fitzgerald's novel, especially the words narrated by the writer's surrogate, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and hate the loud, gaudy yet contemporary party scenes. For me the film is balanced pretty well.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.<br /><br />After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.<br /><br />In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his \\"Moulin Rouge\\" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. \\"Gatsby\\" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.<br /><br />The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2 ½ hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.<br /><br />The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  In a word it looks spectacular.  This transfer is an honest projection of the filmmaker's intent.  The film is often very bright, especially when there is a party going on.  The colors are intense and the picture is crisp.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is rich with the mixture of genres in the musical score.  The surrounds are often in play, especially during the party sequences.  Subtitles come in Spanish, Portuguese, French and English SDH.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|From time to time, it's nice to indulge in a good horror flick.  This is a genre that's seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years, but the evolution of horror movies themselves is an interesting story.  At one point, Frankenstein and Dracula were the scariest guys on the block, but eventually had to make room for zombies and werewolves.  Then, Alfred Hitchcock came along with his own set of foes, including The Birds and an innocent looking motel owner, named Norman Bates.  Psycho kick-started the \\"slasher\\" sub-genre, which eventually led to the creation of iconic villains, such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddie Krueger.  After a period of constant sequels and cheap knock-offs in the 1980s, slasher films turned into more a joke than anything else.  However, horror found new life in hits like Scream, The Blair Witch Project, and The Ring - which has evolved into the horror genre we see today.  Now, it's no longer about the bad guys trying to get the babysitter.  It's about the innocent families at home and the pesky evil spirits that are trying to \\"get\\" them.  Films like Paranormal Activity, Dark Skies, and Mama have fascinated audiences, so it's no surprise the newest horror/suspense film, The Conjuring, is also enjoying early success.<br /><br />Directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious), The Conjuring tells the true story of the 1971 events at a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island.  Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), along with his wife, Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and their five daughters, recently moved into a new farmhouse.  Suddenly, strange events begin taking place at night, leading the family to contact a married couple that specializes in supernatural occurrences.  For years, Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), have dealt with mystical dark forces and believe they can assist the Perron family with riding the evil that has taken a grip on the innocent-looking farmhouse.  Mackenzie Foy, Joey King, Hayley McFarland, Shanley Caswell, and Kyla Deaver also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />There's very little not to love about this film.  From beginning to end and from top to bottom, The Conjuring is one of the best horror flicks in quite some time - and the praise should go squarely to the masterful cast.  It's not uncommon for horror films to flourish without well-known star power, and The Conjuring is no exception.  Sure, there are plenty of recognizable faces in the film, but it's much more likely that you'll be wondering where you've seen them before instead of being able to recite their previous roles.  Regardless, the entire cast leaves little room for criticism, spreading the workload relatively evenly and often becoming so involved with their roles that occasionally you'll forget it's still a movie.  These relatively unknown players bring their A-game and provide for an absolutely superb viewing experience.<br /><br />The Conjuring is actually based on real life events in which Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated a farmhouse.  In case you've never heard of the Warrens, they are most well-known for their involvement with the Lutz family during The Amityville Horror case in the mid-1970s.  Regardless, The Conjuring's plot feels like it could have easily been called The Exorcist, or at least a clever prequel in some way shape or form.  Although the plot of The Conjuring has very little in common with the plot of The Exorcist, it's hard not to mention the similar subject matters - especially since The Exorcist is regarded by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  Like The Exorcist, The Conjuring also plays heavily on the theme of good vs. evil and the vulnerability individuals create for themselves if they aren't overly religious - even though it's hard to imagine a religious family fending off the evil spirits in this film.<br /><br />Going with the same theme as Evil Dead and Mama, the house is a creepy place to be at night.  Why not play off somethingso simply when it works so well?  The Conjuring does a marvelous job of using one specific setting to feast on the fears of viewers and it does so in such a clean, well-constructed manner.  The film appears to be such a low-maintenance production, but it works well, moving from room to room, and using every inch of the house to the film's advantage.  Each area is a pivotal location for the progression of the story, which obviously includes the basement.  It seems like such a played out place to have the most importance scenes of a horror flick. However, it sets the tone of the film from the moment the Perron family discovers it (yes, they had to discover the basement).<br /><br />Speaking of pivotal pieces of the film, there are no more pivotal objects than the props themselves, which are of dire importance to the plot-line.  For instance, Ed Warren keeps an \\"evil museum\\" of sorts in which he stores items from each of his cases - one of which is a freighting doll that provides for an extremely creepy opening scene to the film.  Aside from the doll, a bizarre music box with a circus theme (and of course a clown is inside) and a mirror within creates a method for seeing one of the spirits within the house.  Either of these two props alone could easily keep someone that's easily spooked awake at night.<br /><br />For reasons beyond comprehension, horror movies are a popular means of entertainment.  Not only are they popular, but they've provided some of the most unexpected hits in recent memory.  Obviously, moviegoers love to be scared, only without the consequences (which says a whole lot of bothersome things about society) - yet that doesn't change the fact that these movies provide for chilling and terrifying fun.  While the majority of horror films are either a major hit or a complete miss, The Conjuring absolutely earns high marks for its effort.  The film includes a great cast, well-rounded plot, and enough suspense to leave wear marks on the edge of your seat.  While this film is clearly only for a small target audience (teens, young adults, and horror fans), it will appease skeptics and be loved by horror buffs.  So, if you're even slightly interested in the horror/suspense genre, don't waste another moment - get to the theater!  There won't be a single moment in the entirety of this film that will leave you disappointed.  Enjoy.<br /><br />GRADE: A-<br />FNDNreview.comso simply when it works so well?

B009IF8CH6|5.0|A great episode.  Bob Newhart is genius even at 80.  We are huge fans of the BBT, but missed this episode while we were travelling.  Don't miss this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Have lost some hours to this game, keep thinking just one more run and then catching myself half an hour later!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Pure Neil Gaiman!! Riveting from start to finish .Gaiman knows how to create very believable characters with very few \\"brushstrokes\\" . Hence, his fantasies are experienced as more \\"real\\" than real.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions by themselves would be fun but control a minions in a templerun type game is a blast.  Avoid knocking over rockets by jumping or switching lanes, avoid laser beam stands by sliding under them, avoid the dart gas that clouds your vision all while collecting bananas.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|well, considering i've used computers as tools, my grand  kids can really beat me well in this wonderful game! Fun!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I enjoy the game when it works.  I find that the play area on the screen will move from right to left and increase in size, whether I'm touching the screen or not.  Although I really enjoy the game when it stays in place, it can be VERY frustrating when it decides to jump around and causes misfires.  Not sure if it's the game or my Kindly Fire HD that has the glitch.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is very creative and is great. I suggest everyone buys this. this is true hip-hop. If you love hip-hop you will adore this out.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|My husband and I used the weather channel app pretty religiously for the past couple of years that we've had the kindle fires and now kindle fire HDs. However, this latest version as of a week ago or so is awful. Neither one of us care for it at all and both prefer the previous version. I appreciate  the previous post about the battery life, I too will be deleting the app to save my battery's life! Thank you for sharing about weather bug!
0061122416|4.0|I read this book a chapter or two at a time--not because it was long or tedious, but because I wanted to digest the story and its implications. While I may be biased for having read it during a significant transition in my life, The Alchemist is an easily-digestible, pleasant to read foray into metaphysics, philosophy, and a good old-fashioned fable.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I really liked this game but of late it has been freezing up and other screens have been coming up that shows no way to turn. Also you can't get to buy other characters. Occasionally you can get to the character store but only when you don't have enough coins to purchase, meaning that you will need to spend real cash for the character. Very disappointing.
0679720200|3.0|I can see why this is considered a classic, at least I think I can. I imagine that when it was published its shocking content (and the way it is handled) and succinct prose was likely something of revolution. Furthermore, I could see it being a great tool in a course covering Absurdism.<br /><br />For me, however, it was a mildly interesting, well-written, ultimately slow account of a sociopath stumbling through a life filled with ennui and irritation.
0812977246|5.0|I first read this many years ago. It is so good that I reread it every couple of years. It's subtlety and nuance put all other works in this genre to shame. I'm not a fan of every book that Cruz Smith has written, but most are at least good. However, this and Red Square are truly masterworks.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is contrast of changes that progress at the turn of century between a lord's family and it's household staff.
0440423228|5.0|For those who do not have the time or inclination to read through the thousands of pages in the first five volumes the graphic novel is the way to go. The art work gives life to the characters  and the writing condenses  the story into palpable portions. I enyoyed both volumes, but I still recommend reading George R.R. martin's magnificent books.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This episode was a fantastic finish to a season of wonderful twists and turns. This series truly has moment after moment where you say to yourself, &#34;I didn't see that coming!&#34; I am very much looking forward to next season, and the first ten episodes are definitely worth a rewatch.

B001BZRUR4|4.0|Another great one by Markus Zusak. It won't test your intellect or make you question the meaning of life or anything quite so profound.. It will however give you hours of enjoyment, fill your heart with a warm smile and maybe make you think about one or two things you could better in your own life. If nothing else, it's an easy, feel-good read and great companion on the plane, night-stand or pool side.

B00C0UHGLO|1.0|This game is boring, and the premise is not entertaining, The worst part is that it want's essentially full access to you phone/tablet.<br /><br />There is no reason why a game like this should need to know you GPS coordinates.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|This was a gripping novel to read, set in a male dominated society, at a time when women seldom had the freedom and independence they can have today.  The main character was clearly and convincingly drawn, and the plot plausible. The only difficulty I had reading the book was that of the the 5(?) principal white male characters depicted in the book,  3 were brutish louts and sexual predators. (Thank goodness two were not evil.) The women in the novel had to spend much of their time reacting to/dealing with and surviving the crimes committed against them. They did so with ingenuity and fortitude. All the black guys in the novels seemed decent, hard working, likable people. I found the stereotyping a bit disturbing because of the seeming bias.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, i love the place, and most of all &hellip;i love my horse !<br />You can invite friends to the game , rate the game to get 3gems that's why i made a review on this !xoxo, have fun with the game

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Item as shown and brand new. Shipping was within the time period stated. My friend loved the cd. Would do business again!
0399162097|5.0|As someone who prefers animals to humans, this was a tough-at-times and painful read, but it's so, so good and well written that I never thought of stopping. I finished in two and a half days. The book is truly humorous at times, and the many facts about psychological studies is fascinating. I had to look up quite a few words I must admit. The narrator/main character is so likable what with all her self-doubt and strange family. I had certainly heard of The Animal Liberation Front before reading this book, though not in years. There is so much interesting information in the book and yet it's also so good and entertaining that you are never bored. I read it very fast- 3 hours at one sitting and at least an hour each other time. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I TOOK lessons and now I love horses but when I stopped I missed them so I got a app it is awesome
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is very addictive and I would catch myself saying I would only play one game, yet would just keep playing
159463176X|2.0|The basis of the story was good but there were too many subject changes and too many<br />different people that it was hard to follow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game. I love it. I got some friends playing it. Whether you have  time to kill or not, it's just a great fun game. And who doesn't love minions?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is very helpful. It accurately tells me what the weather will be. It is a real time saver. Easy to use.
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|At times my wife and I had no idea what was going on or why.  A number of scenes seemed completely disconnected and just thrown it without purpose (like the scene of the girl splashing around in a large stemware glass.  The sync'ed swimming and diving made sense as a way to show athletics skill but all the emerging and submerging in water tanks and splashing around seemed completely pointless.  I was surprised and disappointed to see this movie associated with Mr. Cameron and his legacy in film.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|As everyone else has already noted, this watch is just flat out awesome. There's not much else to say about it...
B0040I09RM|5.0|Fabulous show! Can't stop watching!! It is writing, directing & acting at its finest! Well done, FX. Very thankful for amazon prime!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Why is this man barely mentioned in high school curriculum? Why is there no Hollywood film about him?  The cover of this book grabbed my attention and reading about this incredible man was so very interesting. The comments made about the nature and importance of creativity are worthy as a daily reminder. The book read quickly, but left me wondering about this man's family, relations with people out of the work place, etc. Yes....I have lost respect for Thomas Edison as a human being after reading this book (and I didn't have any respect for J.P. Morgan anyway).  The book does leave one to wonder WHAT did the government do with his papers and notes that were declared Top Secret?<br />The author did a fine job with this book and perhaps would consider a second book with more personal information about this amazing genius.

B00DGXGUSY|1.0|Hey there fellow metal headz! I love me some good death metal... my favorites include Slipknot, Murderdolls, Orgy, Limp Bizkit, and Korn... but lately the metal scene has been over saturated with poserz that can't make a good album to save their life (or death? LOL!)...  The main problem with this album is that the musicians have no actual talent.. where are the dubstep bass drops? or the hardcore metalcore breakdowns?? Not to mention.. the lack of good cover songs. Why would you cover AC/DC and Judas Priest when you could do a duet with Justin Bieber or Ashley Simpson??<br /><br />For true metal look no further ... check out As I Lay Crying, Limp Bizkit, Justin Bieber, and The Black Eyed Peas...
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Maybe I just hate Angry Birds.  And I don't use the social media aspect.  Wanted to see what Angry Birds was all about.  Now I know.  I can't see what all the hype was about.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Highly recommend this item. After going through several more expensive pens for the IPhone, I found this.  It doesn't do a &#34;fine line&#34; for drawing but works perfectly for everything else you would need a stylus for.  I got one for my Kindle and also another one for a friend with an IPad.  Also has tips of different sizes which are useful on the various devices.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is one of the most interesting series on television.  The characters are believable but not all of them are likable.

B000002KCC|5.0|This is Exhibit A that music can provide a cleansing of the soul and that pain and sorrow can bring the best out of you. For Neil Young, the pain was the loss of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry and this lead to two of Neil's best in On The Beach and Tonight's The Night respectively. This is the looser of the two albums with less jamming and more of a country feel. It's not technically perfect with its off-key vocals and sloppy performances but that's part of its charm. The title tracks are dark and disturbed as they are poignant while \\"Speaking Out\\" and \\"Lookout Joe\\" show a drunken and relaxed mood despite their loud guitars. \\"Mellow My Mind\\", \\"Albuquerque\\", and \\"Tired Eyes\\" may start out as something from Harvest but once the lyrics kick in, they reveal themselves to be more somber than anything on that record. \\"Roll Another Number (For The Road)\\" is another loose anthem with a good singalong chorus while \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\", a track where the aforementioned Whitten does the lead vocal, shows a sense of joy not found during On The Beach. As many longtime Neil Young fans will tell you, this isn't for the first time fan. You listen to this one after you listen to at least 5 of the most popular ones. However, once you're in Neil's world, you always go back to this one (and On The Beach).
B006K1IIHA|1.0|Man what a waste of time.... this blue ray doesn't work on US players.<br /><br />Can't amazon check to make sure it's going to a compatible region!!<br />??<br /><br />....at least I was able to watch it thru my Amazon Prime account!
B0009Q0F5U|3.0|The music of BSG started at minimalism and ended up at omniethnic rock opera. The first season soundtrack is more on the minimalism side, but the last few tracks include the only vocal rendition ever released on \\"Wander My Friends\\", the bagpipe infused military theme, as well as the introduction of the operatic element through some stirring string and voice pieces.<br /><br />I've been listening to BSG soundtracks for years, and I don't go back to Season 1 much. It was great television, and it's nice to hear some of the early themes develop, but I don't find it nearly as entertaining as the next three seasons. Worth buying if you want to understand that development or if you just like the show.
1401929281|5.0|Wonderful book with great insight and techniques to use daily and with clients. Reiki practioners are able to use this during there sessions.
B000065KH2|5.0|Although the story is fiction, it's a great story of a talent that the world would never know.  A baby, abandoned on an ocean liner, grows up on that ocean liner and never setting foot on land, to become a musical virtuoso.  His talents came to him naturally and he learned by listening.  Through his incredible ear he was able to recreate any musical piece he heard and his talent surpassed that of the best musicians of his day.  It's a sad story of a man whose life was so limited by his surroundings and his fears of the unknown, yet so triumphant in his musical endeavors.  A masterfully woven tale of one man's life and the lives of those who knew and loved him.  I have watched this movie many times and each time I do, I still feel it pull at my heart.  Absolutely wonderful movie!
1781162646|5.0|This is one of those Stephen King works that isn't the typical horror-show.<br />Yes there are some super natural elements but King also graces some of his characters with some of the best traits of humankind.<br />The characters experience most feelings anyone has from young love to jealousy to superstition and fear...and more.<br />As a long time and hardcore Stephen King fan I thoroughly enjoyed this even though I had tears streaming down my face by the end. And not out of sorrow but from hope more humans embody the spirit of the hero.<br />I'm not a book critic but simply a fan of Stephen King's books who loved this story.<br />I'm sure many would say this is a maudlin work and not his best...but if you are a fan of SK's you won't be sorry for one minute if you buy this.<br />Yeah I know a lot are going to rate this review as \\"not helpful\\" but I predict SK fans will get it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it. its challenging and its really cool to find out how a character runs. its kind of hard trying to get all the things that glow and u need to get. so its very nice.  Seka out.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|My hubby is the hardcore Alien fan in our family and I purchased this for him.<br />I'd gotten him the full DVD set of all the Alien movies a few years ago when it first came out. I'm talking about the big box with like 9 or 10 discs.<br />That thing is a behemoth and when he opens it fully it to show all the discs it must be close to 5 feet wide, if not more. And each version of each movie is on a separate disc. And then there are the extras discs. When it's spread out all the way it takes the entire couch. It's pretty much a pain if you want to watch Alien 3 or 4 to unfold all that.<br />This Blu-ray set is so much smaller - 5 discs in a box half the size of the first ( valuable for limited shelf space ) and contains even more features. And the box format itself is way better...not sure how to say this other than they got a lot more content into a lot less physical space.<br />One disc has both the theatrical and \\"special edition\\"/\\"directors cut\\" versions of each Alien movie so that saves a lot of space.<br />And the extra features have everything on the old set and more. Some are even on the same disc as the movie they pertain to. Hubby loves that he has even more content on fewer discs.<br />The movies also look amazing in Blu-ray...just when you thought it was safe to be satisfied they blow you away again!<br />I also got an amazing price with my Amazon \\"Prime\\" discount and it arrived a day sooner than promised.<br />Hubby is over the moon and I'd gladly get this for him again.<br />Even though I have to sit through the movies AGAIN...at least they look and sound awesome!<br />Sign me...a patient wife...lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a lot of suspense! need more levels asap!! should b never ending... level 10 was the hardest ...great mind game!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was so happy when I signed up for a free month of Amazon Prime and found that Downton Abbey's third season was available (UK version).  It hasn't started in the U.S. as of yet, so I immediately started watching the new season.  It was fantastic, although this season had some disappointments (no spoiler alert here).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Brilliantly written, I enjoyed every word and couldn't put the book down until the last page was turned. I'm off to buy book 2 now.
159463176X|3.0|Almost like Quentin Tarantino's disjointed plots, only the plots don't come together leaving the reader lost without a connection to any single character. Not comparable to Hosseini's other books. I felt the author struggled at times to write vivid narrations. I enjoyed reading the maturity of a young author when reading Abdullah's old age struggle. I loved reading the folk tale about divs and jinns. Baba Ayub disappeared just like that. Parwana leaving Masooma in the middle of no where sounded so desperate. I am disappointed. I wouldn't keep this work among my re-read piles in which Hosseini's other books are kept.
B009WUBERW|3.0|For all the stars, you would have thought this would be an awesome movie.  But it was really just OK.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|How to find the words to describe this amazing series? I savor each episode. I am on the verge of obsession. My only regret is that I'm so late to the party in discovering this wonderful show. I love watching the dual drama lines and being able to peer into the lives of both the privileged residents of the Estate and also the servants employed there. The characters are intriguing, the settings of Highclere Castle and the English countryside truly a treat for the eyes. And the costuming (those hats!)... I just love every aspect of Downton Abbey. Maggie Smith has never been better; it's simply a delight to watch her every expression and nuance of performance. I would be surprised if you weren't hooked by the second or third episode. It took me only one.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|We started off watching this series on Season Four and liked it so well we startd watching every season.  Show is a lot like X-Files with a British twist.  Group of characters pursue unusual police cases.  Most turn out to be aliens of some kind. Love the cast they've brought together for this seris.  Main character (Jack) is American, which helps make this series easier to relate to.  Highly recommended.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|Kurt  Russell does a great job in this movie with very few words. Good supporting cast with Connie Nielsen looking fantastic and  Jason Isaacs playing one bad commander.  Have watched this movie several times and enjoy it every time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing!! I love it! Everyone should download it. It is simple, my 7 year old sister can do it! My sister loves it and it is good for all ages in my opinion. Even horse-loving adults will have fun. This game is also very addictive. I could play it for a long time before getting bored. In conclusion, this is one of the best apps I've ever downloaded. I love it!!!!! XD
B001QWBM62|4.0|This is one of my favorite pieces of equipment I get to use. Its easy clean and never gives me trouble. Only problem that I've had with it is that when I try to connect it to the pc for audio in mode it comes in very choppy and low quality. Not sure if mine is defective or not because i cant find anyone else with this problem.
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Wanted to hate this because I love the originals and have found recent reboots to be plastic remakes (chainsaw massacre)..but this one had a genuine point of view and did the series a service.<br />Great cinematography and genuine intensity...<br />Definately worth seeing if you like horror movies
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Love this recent release from Gregg Allman!  You can still hear the early Allman Brother Band in the background, a force he's never abandoned.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds is always fun, but this one is especially great because of the Star Wars theme! I love the music, sound effects and the new Star Wars weapons! Darth Pig!  LOL!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I waited until I could get it free streaming on Amazon Prime.  It was worth the wait.  How could anyone give this series anything less than 5 stars.  I suppose some people expect more, but this is pure entertainment.  Something you can watch on a Saturday afternoon while you are crocheting a baby blanket.  Oh, wait that is what I am doing!  I actually have 3 episodes left and I am doing the finishing work on the blanket.  Easy, enjoyable way to spend a Sunday afternoon too!
B0053TMP24|5.0|THIS BOOK IS SO EPIC!!!!! I WOULD SO RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO LIKES AWESOME STUFF!!!!! READ AND ENJOY!!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Cried at the end, which is ok...was a happy/sad cry...I'd reassigned it to friends for sure.
0783233477|5.0|Loved this movie and watched it with my 18 year old son and his girlfriend and they both loved it too!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book so much!  It was hilarious!  I can't tell you how many times I had to stop and dry my eyes because I was crying so hard from laughing.  If you don't read anything else for a while...make it this book.  You will love it.
0767821769|5.0|Such a sweet and true to life movie! It really warmed my heart! I saw it when it first came out and forgot about it. When I saw the movie repeat on TV I knew I had to have it for my collection!
140006922X|2.0|the summary is: JESUS was killed by the roman empire because he was trying to create a actual kingdom on earth and overthrow the roman empire.  Really off the mark.  Incredibly off the mark(imagine a person holding their eyes shut and sticking their fingers in their ears) if you are familiar with HIS teachings and all the people who have practiced HIS nonviolent method...notably...MLK and Ghandi etc...imagine non-violent folk really getting peeved and doing some letter writing, yeah Rome never crucified anyone for that.  Pontius pilate washes his hands in the good book because his wife warns him to not get involved because of a dream.  In the book you theorize(nonfactually) he would have never done this....fiction...not historical accuracy.  as for JESUS not considering himself LORD....\\"I  and the father are one\\", \\"if you have seen me you have seen the father\\"  islamic evangelism at it's best...which would be a compliment to the author... good spin! nonfactual ideas which are easy to verify their level of error....I cannot say original because this is an old idea.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|There has been so much alleged, whispered and shouted about Hoover's FBI that its hard to imagine making it into a satisfying film, but Eastwood has done it nearly to perfection.  The film is so SO good. Leonardo Decaprio and Armie Hammer are utterly and tragically convincing so that you feel their connection clear to your toes.  The creation of the FBI in Hoover's framework changed the very history of law enforcement-mostly for the benefit of honest citizens.  The tempering effect of fellow agent Clyde Tolson is shown to perfection. The power held and wielded by Hoover's secretary has probably never been shown before.  The death scene will put a lump in your throat and an image in your head that you will be able to see at will when you close your eyes.  This is a very powerful movie telling an almost unimaginable true historical story.  It even puts an entirely new spin on Hoovers reputed cross-dressing.  Every history buff will admire and applaud this wonderful film.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Easy read, good summer read. Story is very unbelievable. Not a book I would recommend. Lots of repeating in story.
B00817RYCG|4.0|I enjoyed the story.  My daughter did not but it was a school requirement which always makes it more difficult.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Sophisticated soap opera with amazing cast.  I am looking forward to season 3. Bummer that Matthew gets killed off though.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am not happy with the new change.  Why fix it if it ain,t broke.  Go back to the old one if it can be done.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|story so far great but the pages have been all muddled up so lose track of where you are have given up..
0440180295|5.0|This book arrived perfectly on time, and though it is a little old, looks completely readable. I like the smell of old books, so that works really well!
B006S08RLU|5.0|I'm a sucker for foreign films, but this movie is still one of my all time favorites. I have wanted a friend to watch forever but couldn't find it anywhere until Amazon had it on instant play. We watched it, she loved it (as I knew she would). Good experience using the Amazon player for the first time. Really like the idea of &#34;instant renting&#34; as Netflix just doesn't have everything, red box is so limited, and there are no video stores around me.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Maybe if you're a kid...this was fine. But this thing needed a ton more story.The special effects were pretty cool though!  I think if I were eight years old, this movie would blow me away.  Ha ha.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Guy's just go to the forecast button and scroll up, then u will be able to see the hourly weather, hope this review helps
B007JOM0GC|5.0|But after seeing the 'Part of Me' movie...I gave this record a shot.  It's actually really good, and if you don't start singing along pretty quickly, there's something wrong with you.  Seriously.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great graphics, great sounds, great puzzles. More fun and addicting than the original Angry Birds. Love the Star Wars tie-in.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Honestly, I don't like today's pop music or stars.  I hadn't tuned to the pop station in Austin for YEARS.  Someone said I needed watch this movie, and I finally got around to it.  I was actually blown away.  I didn't know anything about Katy, except that I thought she was the same idiot as the rest of today's pop idols.<br /><br />This movie changed my mind completely.  I have a bunch more respect for Katy.  I even bought her latest record, because I enjoyed the honesty of the movie.  Keep it up Katy!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|The headline says it all. This film is a great addition to a B-movie collection. The acting and special effects were done rather well.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I am working my way through all the seasons - the story telling is first rate, the casting is amazing and off beat, the acting is stellar! And the acting is first rate because the show - set in Chicago - is actually shot in NY (and CT) where they can draw upon superior NY actors!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Getting too convoluted, not sure if I'll keep watching next season. I do hope Nolan gets out of his problems.
B0049J3QF4|1.0|The movie was not work ..we lost the money .... 2 times IoI. I think I'm not going to use this service again
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a game worth getting. Keeps you thinking! Download it now! I can't wait til they develop new games.
B004QSQML8|3.0|You have to be into the fantasy movie mood to watch this movie. I ordered it because I remembered watching it as a kid. The movie isn't that great but it has the coolest devil ever made in the movie and every character fits the part. In this edition there's extra footage that hasn't been seen before. Nothing great just little things. Ok movie, it is worth watching once.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|The storyline- Will superheroes unite to defeat giant, metallic, flying silverfish-the minions of a semi-god? well, with Captain America calling the plays- it's victory for the good guys! Good grief, Joss Whedon- really? the dialogue is dreadful. snappy repartee must  fit the character - Buffy- good- Half formed Avengers- bad- like Gilmore Girls- good- Bunheads-bad. sellout is an oldfashioned word/concept but appropriate here.  really a waste of time.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I must have seen it 50 times at the midnight movies in the 80s.  This version includes the most bang for the buck you can get and you get several versions of the movies that have to be seen.  Each version is just like a somewhat new movie and they are all really good.  This thing is definitely worth the money if you are a zombie and Romero fan.  You know what it is about, now you just need to finish up your collection.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Such an interesting storyline and it surprised me in the end.  I love it when I can't predict what's going to happen!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It shows what people went through in order to survive. Many people had to do things that they never wanted.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have been a fan of Nicholas Sparks since The Notebook (long before the movie came out), but it's hard to beat that one.  This was a good book but not one that I would say was incredible or extremely memorable.  The dialogue wasn't natural at times & the crazy ex-husband part was a little far fetched at the end.  However, this was an enjoyable book with a sweet, clean love story & a surprise ending.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Clever and addictive, with great acting.  Some of the details of the cases seem a bit far fetched, but my advice is to just go with it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Loved, loved, loved this rollercoaster fictional fun-ride. The characters were well thought-out and the story unfolds around them in a lush and verdant landscape that rolls and tips and turns through a strategically planned storyline. For me, the hand-selected photographs only add to this tale and it's power to suck you in  to this world of magic, monsters, and magicians.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I pretty much read this book in one setting.  I loved the written language of Ireland, the sadness of youth and the hope of the future.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|an interesting idea...reminds me of Chaucer's pilgrims.  Like many readers, I was pulling for Harold the whole time. Harold Fry is an inspiration to not only characters in the book but also to readers.  I was a bit surprised at the 'Hollywood ending'.  I wasn't expecting Harold and his wife to experience that kind of connection.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|It prevents my Kindle from breaking if it fell out of my hand unto the pavement, its easy to spot among other tablets in the house  would defiantly recommend it to other friends
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good entertainment... Humor and action with a group of really good actors. I really liked the dynamic between Willis and Parker...the sequel is set up nicely.
143911000X|5.0|I purchases two copies of the book after watching 6 seasons of How I Met Your Mother. My buddy and I both loved the series and the book did not disappoint. As you can see by the books 4.5 star rating it has been well received by many fans of the TV series. It has everything you would expect and it is a must have if you are fan!<br /><br />Do note this book is more of a novelty item for fans of the series!

030758836X|3.0|Contains some strong passages and, for the most part, plot moves cleverly. Technique of alternating first-person narrations works well. Contains many weaknesses, including the ridiculous ways that Amy handles money (not just irrationally, as most people do, but in several ridiculous ways).<br /><br />I did read to the very end, which I seldom do when a novel is full of weaknesses, and I very seldom read mysteries at all. This one kept me fascinated, except for the sputtering, langorous descent in the last dozens of pages. Feel free to stop reading any time after you turn the page to part three.<br /><br />Best true story: on the same day that I read most of GG, I saw Piper in Netflix's Orange is the New Black (episode 5, near the beginning) reading it! In the slammer!
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|There are nine 'experiments'. The first involves putting a wish 'out there' to the FP (you'll find out what FP is when you read the book) and one should get a response within 48hrs.<br />I did and I'm still waiting, 3 weeks later. First experiment failed, is it even worth doing the rest!<br />The author knows/has read/has been told a bit about quantum mechanics and tries to use QM to justify an all encompassing &#34;force'. Physics terms like 'force' and 'fields' are used completely out of context, I tried ignoring these obvious errors and read on but in the end I concluded that the book had little substance.<br />Anyway, book has some (a few) good titbits but the overall theme leaves much to be desired.
B0047VSW30|3.0|This movie spent very little time on the important characters and spends most of it's time blaming the Christians for the burning of the great library and the downfall of Alexandria. I am not a religious person, the only times a church sees me is either a wedding or funeral, but I felt this movie was a little heavy-handed in its one-sided approach and blame game.
B0029ATTAQ|4.0|it was okay my husband enjoyed it more than I did, I was expecting it to be more like the book.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|A good version of the Pride and Prejudice story.  The actors did a great job in portraying the characters in the book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I so want an Ana in my life, Christian you lucky SOB.  Now I want the EL James to finish where she left off at the end with HIS point of view.  YES YES YES THREE MORE BOKKS!
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|Seriously?  I lasted until the torching of the Mona Lisa...<br />\\"Humanity can't survive a 4th World War\\"...<br /><br />So they try to eradicate emotions with a Vulcan-police force?<br />Or should I say the Observers from Fringe?<br /><br />One that dresses like Neo in the Matrix...<br />And attempts to act cool and shoot like Trinity...<br />But just comes off as a mass murderer from some cheesy horror flick.<br /><br />And they torch everything creative like in Fahrenheit-451?<br />And the 2nd cleric looks like he's developing a conscience and doubt like Guy Montag.<br />Gimme a freaking break.<br /><br />If someone can tell me what original idea exists in this movie that is not a glorification of evil and violence, then I'll give it another go.<br /><br />But until then, I'd suggest watching the \\"BLOB\\" or \\"THEM\\", if you want more sane realistic Science Fiction.<br />Geez.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|This is too small to work properly.<br /> It needs a full size screen with better light adjustment.<br /> Fingers are too large to be specific enough.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Kick ass sound track to a kick ass movie. If you loved the Pacific Rim you will love this soundtrack.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final installment keeps you on your toes and keeps you wondering \\"Who will Katniss love?\\" The determination of her character is inspiring.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game and i have had no problems with it!!!!!! I always play this game it is very addicting
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got into this series much later than everyone else and now know what the buzz was all about.  I probably set a speed reading record; I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't read that much just because I don't have a lot of time but this was the book that was suggested to me to read on vacation.  It's a page turner for sure.  Good read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie. I really think action was great and I loved them to be retired CIA. I am going to the theater this afternoon to watch Red 2. Keep them coming. Plenty of action and humor. Just what I like. I recommend this highly.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The plot is kind of outer space, but the reading was great. I found it to be most likely the best Sigma force novel (so far).
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Being a musician/producer myself, I listen to projects with an ear based on the artist, their talent, production, and etc. I have to say that Joe bar none is one of the or the best R&B artists in the industry right now. His longevity in the industry has been strong with hit after hit, and he seems to get even better with time. In my opinion, I believe that he is so talented that he doesn't have to conform to the industry standard of singing sex laden songs as much.<br /><br />What I'm saying is that Joe is one the last &#34;true&#34; artists in an industry filled with ones with very little talent. The songs are good but, the production, musicianship and Joe's vocals are outstanding! Keep doing your thing Joe, God has given you a tremulous gift!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|With lots of funny parts too.  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  &#34;So fluffy, I am going to die!&#34; Liked it a lot.
0062255657|5.0|My favorite Neil Gaiman story is whichever one I happen to be reading at the time. This, the latest of his novels, while not the tome that is American Gods, is every bit as charming and riveting. It begins with a man relating a memoir of  a chapter in his coming of age as a young, precocious boy who is driven to a friendship with an older, rather mysterious young girl by parents who have no appreciation for his gifts. The young girl possesses a pond which she believes is an ocean. The tendency to dismiss her as the heroine because of her belief makes a subterfuge of her true purpose in this part of the young boy's life. He goes to great length to assert his independence which leads him to places and creatures beyond his understanding, with his new friend as his guide. Mr. Gaiman's imagination is boundless, and his gift for creating mythology in this instance is reminiscent of his treatment of the American gods. The story is very compelling and, while not brutally gruesome, ala Stephen King, it is, nonetheless, a frightening account and left me unable to put it down until the very last savory word. It's a fast, entertaining read, and makes me impatient for Neil Gaimen's next work. The Ocean at the End of the Lane was pre-ordered from Amazon months before it was published and was well worth the wait. Bravo Mr. Gaiman!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 4 year old Grandson was having so much fun showing me how to play it on his mini IPad that I decided to see if I could get it on my Kindle Fire!  I found this, and he spent the night w/ me and I showed it to him, and he liked it better than the one he was playing!  He showed me a few tricks, and got me through a lot of levels I couldn't get through.  Then he got to the harder levels and said, &#34;Gramma, I don't know this one.  You have to try to do it yourself!&#34;  Ha!  So true!  I'm having a ball trying!  Enjoyed it with him, and he's gone back home today, and I'm enjoying playing it by myself!  I'll try to make him proud, and who knows?  Maybe I can show him a few tricks, too!!!!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I truly like watching the NCIS series because it always keeps me trying to figure out what and who is going to be the bad guy. The cast of characters is real enjoyable to watch also.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Nice to see the lead from Brotherhood playing a nice guy and he does it very well. Funny, charming characters support good plots. Production values are excellent and it makes for a nice evening.
B00BBA6FMU|2.0|Didn't finish reading this book. The story line was predictable except the awful treatment of the slaves was portrayed well
B009IJJB8G|3.0|This adaptation is credible and fun. There is good chemistry between Lucy Liu and Holmes and New York<br />is a great setting.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Reminded me of watching a rom-com movie where you can just enjoy the ride without thinking too hard. Some of the situations were laugh out loud funny.
B001NA6096|5.0|Loved it. Sad, funny, exploration of a one night romance. Can't wait to catch up with these characters in the sequels.
B008MM9630|3.0|fun game don't like the diamond usage on certain items and it has a tendency to kick me out in the middle of tending to my farm and I lose my crops and coins when it drops out like that.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-Squared is an entertaining book with fun experiments.  Pam Grout's style is fun to read.<br /><br />One thing to note: this book is a re-write of her earlier book &#34;God Doesn't Have Bad Hair Days.&#34;  I have the earlier book and when I started reading this one I realized it is essentially the same book.  I enjoyed it anyway and decided I was supposed to read it again!
0345529057|5.0|read the first book , loved it can't wait to start the second, going to the jersey shore for a month and will b reading on the beach..the HBO series enhanced the understanding of the series and was true to the books so far.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film is a piece of art. The music fits the art of the animation perfectly, the story is amazingly written. The first time I saw this movie I was speechless. I do, though, recommend RENTING it BEFORE buying it, because Japanese Anime films are not for everyone. It was great though. An easy 5/5.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Unsatisfied with simply delivering the weather to the discerning public,  T.W.C. app's advertisement are distracting beyond what is acceptable.  Further, I dislike 'earning and spending' apps.  What I wanted from this app: weather report.  What I got: lots of garbage.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Adults and kids should read this book.  Auggie's differences are visible to everyone.  All he needs is for people to treat him like anyone else.  A great book to start a conversation about tolerance and kindness.  The world would be a better place if we could all just be a little kinder.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this game on my cousin's IPad and I thought I should get it on my Kindle. I totally recommend this game. Get this game if you love Despicable me.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|An amazing story, hard to believe that it happens in the 21st century. Touching and eye opening to the plight of the North Korean people.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A single professional woman is in a similar, though often smaller, kayak.  I appreciate what Sheryl related.  I would love to have the opportunity to consult with a man in my own house.  However, I do not have that opportunity.  I do not have children, a husband or a very lucrative job.  One of my women employees was absolutely shocked by my not immediately sending her home on the one evening that year when she was scheduled to assist at an annual meeting.  She assumed she could not leave a slightly feverish child alone with her husband, the child's father.  She thought I was utterly heartless--even \\"unnatural\\" since I don't have children.  I couldn't POSSIBLY understand the emotions attendant on being a parent and how much more important a 99 degree fever was in her universe than a very important meeting for which she was a key player.  But, I think I gave her perfectly competent, available husband, the child's father, more credit than she did in the situation.  The child was feeling better even before she arrived home a couple hours later after the annual meeting.  She probably wouldn't have questioned a male supervisor about staying if HE had ascertained that the husband was available to watch the child for a little while.  I think some advantage is taken of single women supervisors by any parent she supervises--and sometimes that is okay, but not that time.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Hilarious!  Jennifer Aniston was fantastic in her role!  And the concept was ingenious.  I'm sure we've all had a horrible boss along the way!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching this show in the middle of season two.  Seeing the first episodes adds to my enjoyment even of some things that happened in this year's episodes.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Emma and Marisa were great, too!  I would have bought this movie just for the Ryan Gosling abs scene alone.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|No other film about the Holocaust comes as close to driving you crazy with the terror as does this.  Ralph Fiennes is a psychotic monster who can be seen in the US Congress today and that is repeated throughout the film as we see the portrayal of evil in every scene and feel the pressure for every minute.  Every soldier knew he was killing an unarmed person, destroying their lives, being devils, and they enjoyed it.  No dragging of their feet but goose step marches into evil.  Speilberg gave this film everything and knew how to play the open beats, to leave silence when needed.  The original B&W film was enhanced by Tom Ogburn's Tomakote film process application and the HD transfer is marvelous.  Liam Neeson still has not found a better role that fits him so well physically and artistically.  If only Speilberg could use that enormous talent of his to as powerfully document the experience of American Indians or Blacks or poor Whites.  Thank God he was able to bring it all together for his own people, as he should.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was intrigued to read about his experience, but some of the medical facts don't quite add up.  Rather than overstating the medical part in order to try to prove something, I would have preferred that he just present his experience.
B00BF124PC|3.0|With so many Bin Laden films now, documentaries, news specials, etc., the story has become trivialized and this movie continues in that vein.  It's focus on the psychotic tension of a young female CIA case officer whose only qualification is her ego-defining pursuit of fulfilling her will by killing Bin Laden may be seen by some as a woman filmmaker trying to boost the role of women in our conciousness but it fails.  You simply don't want to see this woman CIA case officer ever again by the time she lifts the body bag and looks on the dead face of a man her willfulness has killed in his bedroom.<br /><br />Was Bin Laden a monster, of course.  Was the Seal team highly trained and almost mythical as they walked between reality, fantasy, and history, without a doubt.  Was the intelligence community amazingly well-wired so as to catch even off hand comments and build from those back to an understanding of a world of criminals who thought they could hide in plain sight, absolutely.  Was the first Black President of the US on the line not only in the US but across the world after having toured the planet promising a new relationship while actually practicing what Richard Helms, David Atlee Phillips, and others had tried to do to Fidel Castro and maybe botching it so bad JFK ended up dead, incredibly so.<br /><br />None of that is in the film, only the willfulness of one young woman who when asked what else she had worked on for the CIA by James Gandolfini (in what will be his last remembered role as Leon Panetta) replied, &#34;Nothing else, only this.&#34;  Well that may be enough for one person's ego or the glorification of that but it is not enough to make this film competitive with the other stories that come from this event in history.  Storytellers are not innocent and can confuse their own story with the one they are telling.  Better to be a filmmaker.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|What a great cast!!! Good energy, sweet love story, predictable but amusing plot. Perfect for a night in. We really enjoyed it.
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|This is the worst set of casting decisions ever made and just goes to show you the arrogance of the Hollywood filmmakers with their Hawaiian shirts, Docker shorts, Jupiter pens, and the lie that they are &#34;storytellers.&#34;  This is done simply because they could as is true with much of the junk pouring out of the phonies who have simpered their way to the top.  A real vision could have taken this to unexpected heights.  Think of the Godfather 2, despite Francis' recent statements, and how Robert De Niro was cast into the culture not just a film.  Sequels can be as good if not better than the first efforts as with Wrath of Khan and other examples.  This is not that.  Don't buy this, rent it if you must.  James Franco knew this wasn't working as he did it.  He knew the money was good and no one else would have promoted him this high so he went along with it and the trouble is it shows.  I bet most people avoid a James Franco film from this point forward.  It wasn't worth it James.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|This app would be at 10 if...my future Dr. Could operate on a plethora of clients. Why not a African American boy who has fallen off his horse and landed in a bush. What about a Pacific American who has been chased by a Chinese beetle. Wouldn't it be great to see a native Americn...Could we use the xray  and a cast??? $3.99 expected more.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Ever since the &quot; upgrade&quot; my kindle freezes when I try to open the app.  If it does open then I can't read it due to the white letters on an almost white background. very disappointed.  looking for a new weather app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Obsessed with this program. Each season is better than the one before.  The acting is incredible and gives a great look at the era.  Look forward to each and every episode. Really can't wait for the next season!!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is the epitome of literary brilliance. Laced with realism and wit, Rowling took a seemingly mundane topic (that is our everyday lives) and turned it into a masterpiece. The characters were plentiful and complex, and she managed to intertwine their lives with the realism and originality that is indicative of only a truly great author. It is a stunningly raw portrayal of human nature and its response to the political and social atmosphere of today. If you are looking for a happy ending or a light read, this is NOT the book for you. That being said, I devoured this book! It is one that you will stay up late reading even though you have to be up early the next day. Absolutely brilliant.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have owned about 5 different FM transmitters and this is the only one that does a decent job of overpowering local stations. If anything, it does too good of a job as it will ruin the reception of neighboring radio stations. The plug that goes in to the cigarette lighter is short. I had a hard time getting it to fit in my Subaru Legacy. Only after substantial fiddling was I able to get it to make contact. If your car has a deep outlet hole, this will likely not fit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Directions is too basic. Watching the video helps. but mostly figured it by clicking on everything in the room. Once I got the hang of it very fun and interesting.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The book is not what I expected after reading the reviews, but very enjoyable read.  I think it is to bad that the book description gives away a plot detail that is not exposed till you are 25% through the book, so I recommend reading the book with out reading the publisher's description.
B008M7JODC|5.0|I was a big fan of the X-Files and the similarities between the two shows are pretty apparent.  I have found the story line interesting and it is holding my interest.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is a hilarious movie that will make anyone laugh. I would highly recommend watching it!!!!!!! I love it!
B000U6BT40|4.0|Its fun to catch up on programs that I missed when on reg prime time.  And I can watch it at my schedule.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Best book I've read this year.  Good story...couldn't put it down.  It's about ego, relationships, ambition and greed.  There was little sex or swearing, if any, so anyone would enjoy it.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|anything Taylor is great . This was in perfect condition was missing one pamlet but it was in mint condition. great to listen to.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series of books by George R.R. Martin is one of the best I have ever read.  They have everything:  love, sex, death, intrigue, betrayal, magic...and even dragons.  Try and enjoy!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I even enjoy watching the episodes more than once, just in case I happened to have missed a little something!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Lots of new features. A great change from the angry birds Rio. Looking forward to more. Keep it coming angry birds.
B002WXA3EQ|3.0|I never actually saw the flick previously.  It wasn't as god as its hype.  However the hd delivery was good on my roku box.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Fast and chaotic, yet fun at the same time. Plus the missions are challenging and have a great payoff. Get this game if you don't have it yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who loves horses! Graphics are also very good! I will never get bored with this game
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It's an extensive app and requires additional download time after you download the app from the app store. Requires constant internet connection. It's a battery killer.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I found this movie, informative, and enlightening in many area's of journalism. I also found this bit on the history of Puerto Rico, a breath of fresh air. True to it's form, America, once again shows us how to take over a tiny island and make it a home for the rich and infamous.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed this movie!  The ease of movie watching a great titled movie at home makes this a 5 star experience.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|After watching his performance on SNL, I decided I had to purchase this Cd once made available. Except for a couple tracks, overall I'm feeling his words of expression.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was monotonous and moved at a snail's pace. I would highly discourage anyone from watching this movie. You will waste a portion of your life that you will never be able to get back. EVER!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Actually bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and ended up loving it so much myself. Like everyone else, I hate when incredibly promising shows get cancelled.<br /><br />At first glance, some of the dialogue is corny, and the premise questionable--I mean, a space Western? How could a *space Western* possibly be good? But it is; it's really good. For running only fourteen-odd episodes and a movie, the character development is impeccable, the story line compelling, and I often find lines from random episodes popping into my head at odd times--it sticks with you.<br /><br />I only wish it had had its full run; several full seasons would have done it the justice it deserved.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book seemed disjointed and constantly was switching from one time to another. Not only did the time of events switch but who was the main character at that point.
0634022296|5.0|This was a great gift for my very musical husband. He grew up with his dad's Beatles records on the stereo (it's a sad household that doesn't), and replicating their songs on his dad's guitar is a wonderful, nostalgic treat. Great songbook.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is riveting!  I recently met Dr. Alexander at a Pawleys Island, SC book store.  What an interesting man, what an amazing story he has.  I recomend this book  to everyone.
078401213X|4.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my brother, and, insofar as I know him to really like this movie, I'd say it made a great gift. He's a big movie-watcher, and this is one of his favorites.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|only downside is the blue-ray version was unrated, the dvd copy was rated. good movie and uncut is much better
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|overall good game it's put together well, I've enjoyed playing it the last couple of days . its like farmville for the military side, build your base and attack lol
B009XIXVU6|4.0|IIIlike Hosseni&#34;s style of writing.  His discriptions are so clear and visible.  I have read several of his books.  My book club<br />read and discussed The Kite Runner.  A good book also.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I like this app because of the fact that since I am helping my doll/daughter, Amy Heather, with her homework, this app helps a lot. She is just learning her math and I am re-learning the math problems that her homework is made up of.
B004H83IM8|4.0|Despite the fact that one disc has two movies on it that you have to flip to watch, which confused the crap out of my mother, everything else was fine.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|A pleasure to read, packed with crucial bits of information, leading to simple but powerful understanding of the meaning and value of our tools to understand reality and grasp its meaning.<br />A must to read for any scientifically  educated or not educated reader, specially young children and students in general.<br />The love that Professor Dawkins confess for science and sound knowledge is admirable, touching and moving, and this book is but a portrait of his brilliant mind, an example of an intellectual hero, a model to praise and follow, a figure of men as men should be.<br />It reminds me of my hungry mind at high school, and reassures me that every night spent reading, studying, calculating and designing since then, was compensated with a profound pleasure to understand just a little bit more than the previous second of each new grabbed discovery.<br />This book can be the best gift for the young minds wondering out there if there is a better explanation for their life purposes other than superstition and blind belief.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use kindle on my phone whenever I am out on errands and have to wait.  Easy to use just like my beloved well worn kindle at home.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great version of spider solitaire. Very fun to play and very exciting as well. Not to mention, the price was right!
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|They got it right this time around. MUCH better than that first attempt of a live action G.I. Joe movie. Way better than the first film. Cobra Commander, the vehicles, everything BETTER this time around. I look forward to the third installment!
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This is a very addicting game that is basically new each time you play. With the racing aspect and the buying and selling aspect....an overall great play!
0525425764|5.0|I haven't read this book yet, but I know that I will totally enjoy it because John Grisham is one of my favorite writers.
0385349947|3.0|There have been several similar books with similar messaging, but Sandberg's  storytelling makes it interesting and reinforces our need to step up.

B00CF34B2I|4.0|It's been a while since I've played any Magic The Gathering game and when I saw this, I got the bug. :)  The game play is great.. same concept as past games I've played.  I haven't gotten through all the options available yet, but the graphics are nice.  My only issue is it doesn't always recognize a tap and makes the game difficult to play.  For example, I'll be in the middle of being attacked and want to use one of my cards to block, I'll tap my card and then attempt to block the attacking card and it just won't accept the tap.  I have to tap sometimes as many as 10 or more times to finally get it to work.  And I'm on a relatively large screen with a Galaxy Note 2.  Other than that.. I'm really enjoying this game and hope to play it for a while.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I have watched this movie ever since I was a kid and I got this for my friend for her birthday cause she loved it at my house!  Knew this would be a great present!

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I recommend this game for all ages. Great graphics, &amp; lots of fun! This is one of the best games I've played!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and suspenseful, Gone Girl keeps the reader guessing from the beginning until well beyond the end.  It is that  book that when interrupted by obligations or the need for sleep you are eager to find time to resume your reading.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I love this series as it keeps you on your toes - never quite sure what will develop next.  The actors are wonderful and each character seems quite well developed.  Definitely worth viewing and I can't wait for Season 2!
0553801473|5.0|all i can say this is probley the best book in the series and also by far probley the longest
B004SB60OC|5.0|Normally you can't listen to a whole cd and find all songs enjoyable but this one is nice.  Perri's voice is pleasant for me and her lyrics make sense.
B005JABSB6|5.0|These were exactly like the ones we got with our 3D TV.  Love them.  My advise, if you have a 3D TV and need more glasses, make sure you buy the same ones that came with the TV. We tried &#34;compatible&#34; 3D glasses and they didn't work.
B00AF6B22E|2.0|this is the worse movie Denzel has ever made. I watch it, then threw it away..BAD Movie  Very dispointed for Denzel
B00D3XAA4M|4.0|What was in there was very good.  Would have liked more information on some other countries like Ireland and Scotland.
B009AMANH4|5.0|What wonderful portrait of Lincoln flushed out by Daniel Day-Lewis!  Politics has been described as the art of the possible and this film displays Lincoln as a political realist.  The film does a wonderful job of transporting the viewer back to that time and space.  Well done!
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|This book grips you from the start! It has all the elements of a true drama; mystery, love, crime, secrets and unforgettable characters. I love gothic novels and an aspect of them I truly love is that the houses these stories are set in are living breathing characters and at times can be more important to the story than any of the characters. As much as I loved this book I do have an issue with books that have no positive female figures. Daphne Du Maurier is certainly not the only author guilty of this but it remains frustrating. The protagonist is such a meek, weak, compliant woman that she isn't even worthy of having a name. Though I must say this could have been done on purpose - to illustrate just how different she is from her rival. Which brings me to Rebecca - Rebecca is a mean, calculating and promiscuous woman. Why is it that women in literature can't be well-rounded, multi-dimensional people. Either they are happy home-makers or sex-crazed villains or whatever other sterotypes the author feels like perpetuating. Now you're probably wondering why I gave this book such a good rating! This book truly deserves it's modern classic status and will have you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|This is a film that grants us a more personal look into the family life of Navy Seals.  The acting isn't great because the men aren't actors, but rather real Navy Seals.  The action scenes are very good and the film gives you a deep appreciation for the Navy Seals.
0446580848|5.0|This was a great continuind series of stories for Det. John Corey.  A must read. I truly enjoyed it and will be reading the whole series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a great app! The ponies are really cute and the quests are easy. The gems aren't hard to get either, like they are in most apps.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I have only used it in town to try it out, but it works great!  I learned of it from my daughter and son who have used it for a longer time.  They love it too!  It is also a fun activity for your passengers.. keeping track of construction areas, police, and traffic jams.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|this is a great game. it is fast paced so any short period you are waiting you can play and complete it. trouble is you don't want to stop.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Hope Season 4 brings true surprises. Could guess what was coming beyond the spoilers made public when originally broadcast in England. Also hope it leaves PC out and stays more true to the time period.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|The game is fun but after 5 games or so, it keep crashing in the middle of a game.  Basically, you start with a base that generate spaceship. You send them to conquers other stars.  You win when all stars are conquered. Under 5 minutes per game at easy.
B00112GVFO|5.0|I stumbled on this movie yesterday looking for something good to watch that I hadn't already seen. This was a nice surprise. I don't know why I kept passing it up as one I thought I wouldn't like.  It has everything.  It is funny, action packed and adventuresome.  Steve Zahn's dry wit had me rolling. And he and  Matthew McConaughey played off each other very well. I enjoyed my evening watching this movie very much. Worth seeing.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|This movie had some big names in it and if you are a mom, you could relate but it was just okay.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the story, love the characters, and love the subtle comedy! One of our favorites.we could watch them over and over
B0054SMID0|4.0|The law at it's best & worst!  It was full of twists and turns and kept you guessing until the end!
0307743659|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was creepy, evil and gruesome. I love the character of Jack Torrence. This is a guy who in all honestly is a loser and a drunk, who, cant catch a break. He takes a job watching the Overlook Hotel as caretaker in the offseason. Just him, his wife, Wendy and his young son Danny in a secluded hotel. Danny has a special gift called \\"Shining\\". This allows him to see the dark history of the hotel. This is just the beginning of a downward spiral to true horror. The conclusion will leave you haunted and maybe even a little sad. I recommend reading this book as the sequel \\"Dr. Sleep\\" is due out in September!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Always one of my favorite movies. You know how you have those movies that you watch when you don't want to see something new. I have a list of about 75 approximately. This is one of them. Blu-ray resolution now! Thanks.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|A great movie when I first saw it. It's even better now. Wonderfully reproduced in Hi Def! A must have for all Beatle fans.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A very satisfying, and long awaited, conclusion to the epic journey that started back in the 90's.  Brandon Sanderson is to be commended for the terrific job he did in helping to complete this masterpiece after the untimely loss of Robert Jordan.  I hated to see the epic end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual great story from Stephen King, great twists and turns, you think you know where the story is going but you are wrong.
B005XUC398|4.0|In light of all the shenanigans that seem normal on Wall Street, this offered an insight into how such things ha;;en.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Been searching for this 2 disc special edition for a couple of years now, for a reasonable price & I finally found it w/ a good shipping rate too! Item arrived fairly quickly as well!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Love it all... Q is not my favorite character, but enjoyed all the episodes and the evolution of each season.  :-)
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Story plot not truly believable. Action movie with lots of special effects, but cameo characters entered randomly. Over all entertaining, but I've seen better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well it's as good as both th others. Putting to rest a wonderful series of books. What a lovely story!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I LUV this game it's fun to play. I wish we didn't have to pay for the coins. I think my GRAN-DAUGHTER will luv this game to, we both luv games like this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Different yet equally as good as the first. It fact it eased the heartbreak of the first and left a curious bit of information for the third. I can hardly wait.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|after the update i check the missions now a have  to do over 40 millions or 400 millions near missiles... didnt like it that much...
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|You should give more movie point from ordering insted of mp3 it would make what to rent from you agen the experence was asome
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to check with the weather channel app all the time. Around July 9th 2013 they updated/revised it. It is just terrible now. Smaller map, slow to respond. I deleted it yesterday and went to Accuweather. installed a couple others and am checking them all. Terrible Terrible revision.
1935251740|5.0|Lanza is a biologist first of all,he introduce himself in a theory of understanding the world throught our concience.I think this is a very reasonable way to do it.After all  you realy live when you are concious, without it  you are practcaly dead. But Lanza introduce us,in the world of Phisycs by the Cuantum theory an the energy of space and time which I believe is the key to the Universe. But this field is very dificult to understand for most people.So you need a baseline of knowledge to go through this book, that will let you deeple thinking and interested on Dr. Lanza opinión.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Despite the unfortunate title, this book proved to be very informative for me. It has changed the way I evaluate nutrition and health. After having read &#34;The China Study&#34;, &#34;Fat Chance&#34; and several other books of this genre, I think I now have a better understanding. Despite having been on  'fish eating vegan' diet for over a year, I've felt immediate benefits from the elimination of wheat this past week. I've lost 3-4 pounds and increased my energy levels.  I don't agree with everything the book selling. For example, I see no harm in eating sweet potatoes or home-roasted almonds (as opposed to store bought). But then, I don't buy everything I've read in &#34;The China Study&#34; either. The best anyone can do is to do their own research, study several differing views and then put to use what works best for them.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book shows us the rare frontline fighting man's view. There nothing is glorious about war. The author just tells it like it is.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Such a great second book. Keeps you guessing until the end. You won't be disappointed by this book! I can't wait to start the next one! Great series
B006O5XYWG|3.0|If you remember the old ones bringing a baby chimp back from the future,this is more believable with todays tech.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|Streaming this movie in HD was a bit of a challange. It kept stopping and reloading. May have been a problem with our Internet connection but we usually have no trouble. I wonder if Amazon's web streaming was a bit overloaded.<br />Otherwise, we love the Harry Potter movies and enjoyed watching these kids grow up as they made each movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. The kids and I are having so much fun.  Don't need it to be too challenging.  Good job guys. Would love to play more after we are through
B00138JB3U|5.0|Pink is one of my favorite artists. The album is one of her best and one of my favorite cd's to listen to.
B000002GXJ|5.0|I don't know why it took me this long to order this CD (it was released in 1980!). Incredible live performances of some of the greatest Eagles tunes.  The guitar solos on \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Take It Easy\\" are easily two of the best by anyone ever.  I am listening to the last 2:25 of \\"Take It Easy\\" over and over...classic!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|we loved the movie. such a cute story of friendship and standing up for what is right. definitely recommend it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Got this when it was free for the day. Love it. It has replaced solitaire as my favorite time-waster! Unfortunately, each game takes more time than a game of solitaire.:-)<br />Only complaint is that when I have to pause it and go away from a game, I can't figure out how to get back to that same game.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|my four year old daughter loves the minions. i love the youngest sister she is just to cute. it is a fun family movie
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Each character gets their time. There is a good blend of humor and action. The movie does not take itself so  seriously that the audience starts to question the logic of why a super advanced race of alien beings attacks the planet using flying scooters and handguns. A good time.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|really love this movie. i was so surprised to see my four year old cry like crazy when sara is crying out to her daddy and he doesnot remember her i had to reassure her that it was going to be okay.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Use this antenna with Microsoft Streets and Trips. When prompted, the program automatically looks for a COM_ port associated with your USB connection under Hardware, Devices.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I liked the first season, but the story got old in season 2. Too many of her dreams come true, there's no angst or anticipation.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great for experienced or  beginners.  User friendly,  yet challenging.  Love the reshuffle feature.  Addictive and will keep you engaged for hours.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|My SG3 didn't come with a swype keyboard (I'm in Korea, I guess Hangul isn't very swype-able. Lol)<br /><br />I tried another swype keyboard for a bit, but I rediscovered SwiftKey and am not going back.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I love playing mahjong. This app is really good. I love that there are so many choices to choose when picking the tiles. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was I wish it had music playing.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Nope this was not the one for me. I like playing one game at a time.<br />With six game on a page, the tile is too little to make out the shapes.<br /><br />not for me<br />Thanks
B0091REZMW|4.0|really enjoy this game! I play it on my Ipad and kindle. I got my mom hooked on it too!
B005IDXIL2|1.0|Sorry, I did not like the games layout.<br />I could not figure out the gutterball.<br /><br />thank you for the free try out
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Been ages since I've seen it (bought it for a friend) but it's a great movie.  It will keep you guessing, and for me, was a surprise ending.  Very cool.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game next sand rail and cobblestone roads and maybe add some water ditches.mybe and some weather.how about knocking off a few mountain goat along the way to.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|A beautiful, bittersweet story, AMAZING art and unforgettable characters.  I highly recommend this to any anime fans, and any fans of epic adventures.  It's a fantasy story, but the moral can still resonate with reality.  Beautiful beautiful!
B002XG1OUE|5.0|I bought this for my Dad last Christmas, and it was deemed the best gift of Christmas.  The model of the USS Enterprise was easy to assemble, and the discs sit nicely in the saucer section.  He loves all the extra features and having the digital copy on his laptop and iPhone.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is a complete page turner from beginning to end.  A difficult storyline but one you can't put down as it draws you in from the very first page. A must read!!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|While this is not the most accurate interpretation of Austen's novel out there, the shooting of this film is brilliant.  The use of light, motion, and color is fantastic, and makes me keep coming back again and again.  Love instant viewing on Amazon.com!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|this game looks soo cool!! I have never tried it. the best part about looking and downloading a game is that it looks super cool. I just read one review and I was hooked. it looks like it rocks!!
B006WMILQU|3.0|I liked this film until I read Austen's novel.  The characters are well played and cast, but the plot of the film diverges greatly from that of the novel.  Still love instant viewing on Amazon, though!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the ultimate geek hero story. If you like the 80s, video games, or are any kind of geek (or as Ernest Cline calls them \\"enthusiasts\\") you'll love this. I enjoyed richly created alternate world. My only complaint is that this book is LONG, which lots of descriptive tangents.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The only reason this is not five stars is because there is no option for changing the card tiles. Overall great free app
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|The game is fun, but it gets frustrating when there not much help and everything more money. I just stop playing.
B004ZGI18S|5.0|The movie was amazing. I was wow, left me surprised, must watch. I recommend this movie to everyone. Is really cool
B007SOQBCM|4.0|it not the best app but it ok like I only use it to watch late night with cry and Russ but its not the best connection
B0067R0APK|4.0|Everything works great but the radar maps. Great to watch multiple cities. Severe weather alerts timely and often beat my NOAA radio alerts. Samsung Galaxy S3
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the most wonderful books I've read! I could not put the book down. My attention was on the book 24/7
B008Q0CE50|4.0|The movie is good. It's a bit historically inaccurate but never mind that. Be prepared for some gory scenes but not many.
B00D37UP4S|5.0|This movie was interesting from the beginning. It was good to see how everything came together at the end very suspenseful
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|It is a so-so revenge action movie with a standard plot, low budget and so-so acting...<br /><br />Not one of the best movies starring Colin Farrel. Honestly, I was expecting more engaging plot and performance given the money I paid to rent it... Overall a one-time watch movie, although should be on the bottom of the watch queue...
B00DHNBY02|5.0|This movie was very exciting to watch. very scary very shocking and always suspenseful thank you. Looking forward to other scary titles to watch
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It's OK but nothing special.  I was disappointed with it, I expected it to be more challenging and fun. Wouldn't recommend it.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Fun, unique action adventure movie. The acting makes this movie. Smart script. Worth the rental for. A lazy, summer evening.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Compelling characters, always interesting plot.  The acitng was believable, and the scenery made me feel that we had finally visited Great Britain.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have come upon great recipes, wonderful products, and fun, wacky, beautiful ideas.  Sharing with others your loves and thoughts is so much fun on this site.  I am &#34;hooked&#34; on Pinterest.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The first moment I got this, I knew this would be the perfect case for me. It fits just perfectly for a Kindle Fits, just buy this and you'll see what I mean.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Michael Moss, in his Salt, Sugar, Fat, tells us exactly why we should completely eliminate processed foods from our diet.  He shows us how the profiteers have stacked the deck against the consumer.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|now I can read my books while i am on the go. just open the app and start reading. it's your own personal library at your finger tips.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Presents interesting stories with the most unexpected twists. It also pits what is ethical and what is legal in a constant battle against each other. Sadly shows how the legal system is anything but after truth and justice.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|We have really enjoyed this series. The characters are well drawn and have a depth in their motivations and actions which is refreshing. No spoilers, but don't get attached to anyone in particular. There is a large amount of violence, which is to be expected, and full nudity and sex. So, not for the younger set.  I'm looking forward to Season 2.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|I tried to make this app work, but didn't get it to do what it is supposed to. I have only tried once and will find time to try again later. Setup seems a bit hard to understand.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book traveled back and forth from generation and character which was at times a bit confusing.  But was skillfully pulled together by the ending.  Well written.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|A very fast paced running game! I can't keep up. It's more 3D so I suppose tweens will love it. I like the minions so I keep it on my Kindle to offer to my students or young friends.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I keep hoping the end would not happen. I will re-read this again to make certain I did not miss any thing. I experienced  a range of emotions as I read.
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|In my case when I download the app & indicated that my device is a Nexus 7 Android Tablet. My understanding any of my purchases would be specifically for this device would execute their such. $20 dollars later to find that known of my purchases would operate on my device. I've since uninstalled the app until this problem can be directed. Especially when the program indicates a purchase is compatible with my device when it turns out that its definitely not.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|my nephew's wife got me hooked on this series.  I may have to buy the books too!  anyone read them?
B004GJDQT8|2.0|In my case when I download the app & indicated that my device is a Nexus 7 Android Tablet. My understanding any of my purchases would be specifically for this device would execute their such. $20 dollars later to find that known of my purchases would operate on my device. I've since uninstalled the app until this problem can be directed. Especially when the program indicates a purchase is compatible with my device when it turns out that its definitely not.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I was afraid that the storyline would get muddied up, (as most trilogy seem to do)  The story keeps getting better and better.  I am getting the third book right after I finish typing this.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|A great companion to the ES File Explorer for my Kindle Fire 7 HD.  I appreciate the control it gives.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is really cool! I could play it for hours! All though I wish that it had all the extra features of Scribblenauts Unlimited and I wish I could buy Scribblenauts Unlimited on my kindle fire.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Gave my bf and I some ideas. It's well written , so many of my friends and I have read this book and its so great we can talk about it. People who think this book is just for middle aged housewives obviously haven't read this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Overall a great game, my son is so happy!! The only con about this game is that it force closes often!
B00881VLCE|4.0|So far I'm really enjoying this puzzle game. We work jig saw puzzles all the time. This is very relaxing. Thanks!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|awesome game.  love it.  first time I have played escape game.  I hope it has a lot of floors.  I told my friends about it and they are going to try it.
B005F8CL1S|4.0|Over the years, I have collected some of Leonard Cohen's Greatest Hits CD's and found them to be very good.  I wanted to dig deeper into his music and found this package to be a perfect way to do it.  It is a more Deluxe packaging than most of the Complete Studio Collections, although -no additional booklets or liner notes.  Not a concern, I am more interested in the music.  I think fans of Leonard Cohen will enjoy this collection, there is a consistency in his work that makes it worth exploring.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This book is an great encouragement to those of us like me that work with public relation, and need to have the right things to say in order to achieve the main goal, reach others
B00166BL6Y|4.0|I've always loved this album, I had it on vinyl and CD before. I had bought the Aqualung collectors edition and was very pleased with the bonus tracks and the remix / remastered music.  The improvements here, with 'This Was' are not nearly as obvious; the inclusion of the album in Mono as well as Stereo didn't have any real value to me.  Nevertheless, the original tracks remastered / remixed + the few rarities makes this worthwhile.  Plus, there are some recordings from the BBC sessions that are interesting to listen to.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The first chapter in this book grabs you, and like his other books, Hosseini is a great storyteller. I jumped back and forth between Kindle and Audible and found both enjoyable although sometimes it was easier to read to learn the names and words on Kindle because the narrators' accents were sometimes a bit thick. I did enjoy the narrators though because of their authentic accents. I would happily read this again.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|This is a classic album; I've had this on vinyl and CD before. The 40th Anniversary has bonus tracks recorded during the same period / alternative takes that are interesting to listen to.  The net effect is a more expansive album - the bonus tracks fit the theme and feel of the original album.  The remixed / remastered album is brighter and allows the listener to hear the musicianship of the band clearer - like hearing the album for the first time.  The packaging and liner notes are an added bonus - nice background surrounding the recording and release of the album
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like at first but is a great film.<br />I can understand why it got the awards it did.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be a great app I used it every day . Easy to use great page design. Then without notice they turned it into a piece of garbage that is actually painful to use. Would love to get the old version back.<br /><br />Tleyden
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great way to teach my kids numbers when they help me. Relaxing to play by myself. Keep trying to solve the 3+ suit games.
0375851569|5.0|These are the best of Geisel's books and really are a great intro into reading. These books must have come out 50 years ago, but they still grab a kid's attention and engage her imagination.  These particular copies are large, colorful, with fairly thick stock pages.  The hard covers are glossy and bright.
B00B9LNLTQ|1.0|not even in the same ballpark as their other discs,still not feeling it after muliple times listening to it . Very disappointed
B000JQUZCI|5.0|I was surprised that this book is entirely unlike the movies from the 1930's. I am very glad I read it, as it is far superior to them. Very recommended reading.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I have been waiting for this cd to come out for awhile. Was only available as a import for sometime. Remember going to the show. Great to have it .
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This series is just about the best of the genre. I found it to be more about love and so more of an upper.<br />It's the Hunger Games on steroids. I read through the weekend and was sorry there wasn't more. It's on my re-read list.<br />I've recommended it to many of my friends.
B00865P3AS|1.0|after a great first cd. this was real disappointing.not even in the same ballpark as their other disc,still not feeling it after muliple times listening to it . Very disappointed
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|The perfect family movie. I settled in ready to be lulled into fairies and flowers, but found myself caught up in this amazing little story. The animators did a terrific job. The characters are unique and memorable. Each fairy has a distinct personality. A light little film that will put a smile on your face... no matter how old you are.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series and of Bruce Willis' work in them, however A Good Day to Die Hard is terrible as one in the series. From the very start, John McClain's presence in Russia is unnecessary. In fact, had McClain not shown up, the entire story would have resolved itself properly within minutes. Gone is McClain's Involuntary drafting into action - he willingly throws himself at every event and into every conflict without knowing the players involved or why he should be doing what he's doing.<br /><br />As an action film, A Good Day to Die Hard has a number of packed set pieces of action eye-candy, but the plot is ridiculous and the concepts preposterous. It's not a terrible way to eat some popcorn, but there are better action movies than this, and if you're a Die Hard fan, do yourself a favor and watch any of the previous four before opting for this one.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This movie is such a delight. I streamed it on Amazon Prime. There is so much to love about this flick. It solves the mystery that plagues all kids... what's behind the closed closet door in their bedroom? The animation is superb. I love Billy Crystal as Mike... can't spell that last name. He's always good for a chuckle.
0062255657|5.0|I will start by saying that, for a novel, this is short.  Thankfully it was, as expected, another stunning example of the Author's talent and I was not let down!  It was truly a joy to read and i'm looking forward to more from Mr. Gaiman.
B004SIP7F8|3.0|Bless its heart. It does drag... but it is a classic. I just can't help remembering the Seinfeld episode where Elaine can't contain her frustration while watching the English Patient. She shouts out... &#34;Die Already!&#34; It's hard not to laugh with that memory hanging in the background.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting, great for all ages. I think they could work on the glitching a little bit but still a great game.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|i loved the whole book. especicially the ending because once you finsish the book and put it down you think about it for a long time. i imagined about her being a human again and getting married later on-i say later on because i think its ridiculous to get married at 18- and possibly having kids. i also thought about what could happen with cole and isabels relationship. although sometimes through this book i just wished that cole would stop acting childish, wake up and go smell the roses. i mean he has this possibility to be with isabel and have a full relationship with her sitting right in front of him. just saying. but other than that the whole thing was great. it had a great plot, was very fluid through the whole thing and had enough twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat and gripping the book all day, half of the night, and a little of the next day. i literally finished it in a day and a half. i could barely put it down. although in the end i am sad that the author id not making another book for this series.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I had ordered this item two days ago and received on Saturday.  Plugged my Voyager and it charged up fast.  The case came in very neat and no damage.<br /><br />Great item to have to charge your headset.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a charger.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It served its purpose, which was to wake me up.  I like it a lot.  Just make sure the alarm column is turned up.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I am a action, spy, intrigue junkie, it was worth every cent, that's why I have all the Jason Bourne films!!
190736045X|5.0|Quick and reliable, the book came in great condition,,thanks! Even though the book itself was larger than I thought I still love it
B000W1V5VU|4.0|It is a sequel, and it holds to the theme of the previous movies, lots of action, and with all the great stars in the film, you can't go wrong!!
B000002TLX|5.0|I am a big music fan....and especially the style of Sinatra, Buble, and Marx.  This is a great album to<br />relax to.  I give it 5 stars!!
B00023B1LC|5.0|First in the series, and what got me hooked on the Bourne themed movie's, and with Matt Damon, you can't go wrong !!
B0030F5W5K|5.0|Ditto. There are a few frightening scenes but the love story is excellent.<br />An all time favorite. Ditto, Ditto, Ditto
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love this movie! Ordered 2 copies. One for a Christmas gift for my sister. If you are looking for a great movie with some content besides stupid comedy, this one is for you!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|This is One Republic's best album.  I can't stop listening to it! The songs are not only catchy and great musically but, as usual with One Republic, have meaningful lyrics. I can see most of the songs on this cd to be hits.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I liked it before you changed it. Now I have to wait for it to download. I d I. Don
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Old Pet Shop Boys fans will love this cd, as will new fans.  It features classic upbeat and dance-worthy songs with the familiar synthesized music. It's great having some new material from them - they picked up where they left off as if time stood still.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It's a great show. With her home life issues and a new case at the law firm each show. It's like law and order meets despite housewives.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King did an excellent job developing his characters, and the plot had ample twists and turns to make it an excellent read.
B00CWVM1AC|4.0|The main theme that the life after love goes on gets a bit blurred in this sequel and pushed off to the very end. Great actor play though.
B0020M99LC|5.0|For me, Sean Connery has always been the ultimate James Bond, and while most of the other actors who portrayed the character had terrific careers in their own right, none of them measured up to Connery as the quintessential 007 Agent we all know and love....not until Daniel Craig took over the role that is. To his credit, Craig didn't try to duplicate Connery's performances or make a caricature of them, he simply took the role of James Bond and made it his own. Daniel Craig has brought to the role an enthusiasm and pureness that has been sorely lacking in recent, and not so recent attempts to bring this character to life on the big screen. I highly recommend this version of Casino Royale and Craig's other performances in the 007 series as well as his impressively growing body of work. You won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would highly recommend this game. It's fun and challenging but, not too hard. It's very addicting. Have fun with it.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|This is one of those books that is short, clever and fun to read again, again and again.  Over the years- this book could get as much reading as Stregenona [by Tomie DePaola]
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Excellent script, casting, and acting. Look forward to watching it many time over the coming years.  I highly recommend it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Intelligent writing that makes you want more and don't want to stop watching.  look forward to the next season going to prime.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I think it shows too much info.  It would be better if I could close some of the panes.  It shuts down on its own way too often.  I'll be uninstalling it to find a simpler version.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This book not only is this a story of different life journeys but also teaches you a valuable life lesson.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love Dragon Story! It feeds into your desires to build, decorate, and nurture in a fun way! It's a good game for those who base their success on accomplishments as it allows you to breed several different types of cute dragons via different dragon combinations. You never know what you get from a breeding session until the egg pops out. This games is also nice because you don't have to obsessively check in. You just play as you go. Check in once a day, or 20! The game works with your schedule.
B00D4PDJMY|5.0|Music reviews are usually made subjectively. So negative reviews are individually subjective. I wish people would rate albums more objectively if an individual does not connect with the art/product. Music lovers , metal lovers should and most do understand the differences between material and band member's,time, processes, influences, individual characteristics and all variables and elements concerning the composition of art and music. That being said I connect with this record and Philip as an artist, musician and man. I believe this album is ahead of it's time and right on time. There's a magic at work down on the bayou. The recording techniques on this record very unique along with the structures and final development. I'm sure it's as close as possible to it's original intention and quite frankly couldn't have been completed by any other group of musician's. It is as truly original as it can be and no boundaries exists with this band. Song writing deeply personal and introspective see it or not and guitar work pushed to an extreme as possible without being mathematically impossible and still maintain a heavy below the surface groove and drumming accordingly. Great dynamics overall. It's not hardcore yet so closely related guess it's Phil core. Ha. Very aggressive and frustrated, heavy and packs a knockout punch. This record is like a prize fight that captures you punch for punch on the highest level 12 rounds relentless ending with a knockout but there is no loser and the rematch is the next day and the true opponent is the self.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the clever way Landay wrote this book. It was compelling-hard to put down. Very real characters. I learned a lot about our courts as well.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I absolutely love this show and I cannot wait to continue watching it! It is such a fun great show
B004GUSG4M|1.0|Since this was our book club's choice, I forced myself to read it.  If a potential reader is in a great mood, and wants to ameliorate that state of mind, pick up this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is really great it will just be a little hard for younger kids so I recommend it for 13 years or older
0152023984|4.0|The Little Prince is visiting other &#34;planets&#34;, and he comes upon a stranded pilot in the desert.  What do they talk about?  How do they influence each other?<br /><br />This story doesn't hit you in the head with an obvious point.  The story is subtle, entertaining, and both uplifting and sad.<br /><br />Very imaginative...
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love the game I do wish there was a way to earn diamonds and energy. I am disappointed in the fact I had to reload it after a system update and I had to start the whole thing over. But I love the game.
0425263924|5.0|The book was fun and a nice escape for awhile. I can't wait to see where the next book is headed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|So the book Is  pretty good I would recommend it but their are some things which I did not actually like but very good book!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Bad language and sex not fit for the young. We really are enjoying this series of Game of Thrones and will buy season 2 when were finished with this season 1
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I feel like Oliver Stone is the tired and retired James Bond.  I've read and liked most of Baldacci's books.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|While this is not exactly a new theme or story line it was really sweet.  I loved Megan and all her honesty and her many hang ups courtesy of good OLE Mom's seven marriages.  I also enjoyed Connor and his stupidity of no love in his marriage, EVER.<br /><br />When will they figure out that eventually we all are married for love.  Even if it doesn't start out that way. If you are together for any length of time, love is the only thing that will sustain two people living, working, raising kids and pulling together.  Otherwise there is no investment and no commitment which is the back bone of a couple being able to sustain the marriage contract (VOWS).<br /><br />I think with all the rave reviews that there is no way you could go wrong with this story.<br /><br />Enjoy

B00125WAWS|5.0|One for my collection worth every penny, I was really amazed at a movie that could keep me glued to the chair after thinking this is one that wont catch my attention, The story got away about a group of kids at a school that have high hopes about winning a open debate project. Denzel Washington is the teacher who encourages everyone. Marvelous performance by the cast very entertaining with a great storyline. If you haven't seen it yet hurry up and go get it, A family show that is a must see. I highly recommend it to all. No killing or far fetched ideas no bombs exploding just the opposite. A show for a wonderful night of relaxing with your feet up in front of the television with your munchies, I could say a lot more but why spoil it, another hint it will make you sit up and notice so see for yourself, I rated this an A grade plus for not being boring and been on the move all the way through. The picture is fabulous and a entertainment classic, so enjoy you won't be disappointed.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|installing my amazon mp3 player went without a hitch.i recently changed phones so i had to reinstall it.and no fretting all my music was there when i opened  it.
B009MO5E10|5.0|A must see action with fast and exciting scenes about mail riders in New York that deliver mail to different companies, for a price of cause. Nothing hard about that is there?, Well if the buses and cars don't stop you plus the cops, What will stop you, what about a crooked cop in a car, I suppose he might. Some people just don't know when they are better off, not like our bad guy who just doesn't get it. He is dealing with ordinary people trying to make a living. Now I told you some of it and there is more to it with plenty of turns and falls that might make you sit up and notice. With its full on action from the start to the finish plus a little bit of this and that, just use your imagination as the thrills kick in, so you don't get caught by the cops. I rated this an A grade plus for the excitement and suspense surrounding the movie with a touch of difference with strong acting and storyline how can anything go wrong with a fabulous show. Now I've told you about something about it, go collect your popcorn gather around the television with some friends, try to  put your feet up as it is not going to be a quiet night. Entertainment different and pleasant  to watch.  Enjoy
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  Steve McQueen is a shark of the first order.  Would have been nice to watch him age.  The plot is crisp and funny yet full of suspense.  I loved the story and the cinematography is breath taking.  Still hold its own decades after its debut!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Mr. Hosseini is a great writer and this story kept me turning pages.<br />However I still felt felt that he didn't draw me into the story the way he did in the other two books of his I read.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|It's clever, funny, smart and the acting is stupendous.  The characters are well thought out. I'm waiting anxiously for next year's episodes!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great  way to get the eye and hand working together .  I really love it and the pretty puzzles.  Will continue to play and often

B0060MYM3S|5.0|very good service and attention by the seller, very good product and exactly as described in the picture and features and excellent quality, 100% recommended, all excellent
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It seems that every time you hit something you die. You don't get so many lives, just one. So the game is over. Not liking this. It was free but I don't know how long I will keep it on the Kindle.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|It is action packed and a cool movie! I would definitely watch this again. It was made well. Check it out for yourself!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is fun. I like the games that don't have to load every time. At least you don't die every time your fall!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Everybody loves the free and fun game of angry birds. It's addicting and will keep you coming back to play.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Now watching the third season of Downton Abbey. Although I don't like &#34;soaps&#34; the tale told here is done really well, without a lot of unbelievable nonsense. I'm fascinated as we watch the times change and the way that the residents and staff of Downton either adapt to or resist the change. Well acted, brilliantly costumed and photographed.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I almost gave it 3 stars, but in the end I gave it 4. It is a lower end 4 star movie to me, but still fun to watch.<br /><br />If you like special effects and stunts, there are plenty in this movie. In fact, more than I like. It relies heavily on them.<br /><br />The script, dialogue, and story line is pretty weak.<br /><br />But it is still fun, and this kind of movie is about mindless fun, and it delivers 4 stars worth of that.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its ok it fun but then you don't play it I wood like it more if there wast game like it
B003HV0TN2|5.0|My husband saw this book first but I landed up reading it first. Really enjoyed the story and the character and essentially finished it in one sitting so I could get back to the studying I was meant to be doing. very enjoyable
B006AZZPCM|2.0|now  what I am saying is that it acts like one on the app it is slow and on the bottom were there are adds it says Fatal system erred but first is said (1) virus detected scan now! but it does not affect my kindle any other way on other apps
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't ususally read mystery, murder type books but a few friends said I should read Gone Girl. I am glad I did. It is a good book. Lots of details and twists and turns. Very interesting.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|John Moore delivers a great action picture with a fantastic visual aesthetic done with 35mm film not that digital crap most directors use nowadays without knowing what they're doing, frantic & choppy editing and overall a very kinetic structure. The script is o.k. and the relationship between the two McClanes plays out nicely. All the actors fit into their parts and deliver right on the spot. The film basically is an action fest reminiscent of action films of the 80s, with not too much CGI but huge set pieces that gradually get destroyed. The fact that so many people bash this film while current cinema offers wave after wave of truly idiotic movies that get great accolades from the same people is incredible. The criticism about the action scenes being to much to be survived is really worth something from people who are otherwise more than willing to invest themselves into all kinds of fantasy BS delivered around the clock, get a life damn it! The same goes for the criticism about too much CGI in the picture, Pacific Rim/The Hobbit/Superhero movie of the month are you kidding me?<br />A Good Day to Die Hard is a great movie AND a great Die Hard, unlike the toothless, boring, stereotypical, embarassingly contemporary Live Free or Die Hard that even Timothy Olyphant couldn't save. Die Hard 5 is better than both Die Hard 4 and 2 and even Die Hard 3. No Die Hard will probably ever match the first one, but in terms of delivering a great action experience with McClane thrown into unexpected cirumstances again is a complete success in my opinion, I had a ball watching it! Man I love this movie!

B005BZQVJ8|1.0|it's so bad that i didn't even watch it. i rarely start a movie and not finish, but it was pretty dumb.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|This movie started out wonderfully, had great visual effects and left my imagination wanting more. However, the ending seemed sloppily put together just for the sake of ending the movie in my opinion.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like the book. I started the series and enjoy the story line. I am glad the author will write 2 more books.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|When this program first aired on CBS Sunday night I never viewed it. Actually I never gave it a chance. Boy was I wrong. Since I have Amazon Prime I also get Amazon Video and once I started watching this program I can not stop. I went through the first three seasons in under a month. The fourth season is available for purchase starting August 20, 2013, or I can start watching it @ $1.99 an episode. I hope I can purchase this in time, watch the 4th Season and be ready when the 5th Season starts in the Fall.<br />Fantastic show, the stars all deserve Academy awards.<br />Thank you Amazon for allowing me to catch up on a show that I never watched.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Surprisingly, I enjoyed tis book! I enjoyed the themes of friendship and relationships. Harold was crazily determined, something we don't see or experience every day.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|The game loaded on my phone and then it would not open up, had to delete it from my phone.
B0086213XW|3.0|Do people really go around in circles like when they are having a conversation?<br />Any way these people are like 12 years old.  So what if their&#34;marriage&#34; didn't work out?  They can take a trip to Europe and find themselves and then start over
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|Of all the Lonely Planet books I've used/read, this was probably the weakest. Because there is so much detail in most of the other books I've used I expected the same with this one, but did not receive it.<br />if however you have no knowledge of Europe and are looking for a place to start, this book might do it for you. It may whet your appetite and give you a sense of direction for a European adventure. Surely this was a free download because they hope you will buy more of their books. Ironically, the lack of information and detail in this volume would make me hesitant to buy more LP books were I not already familiar with them...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Bloody, but not in the Texas chain saw way- different and thought provoking.  addicted to this series- hope season 4 can keep us interested!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game soooooooo much it's the best game ever :) :) it's amazing!!!!!!!! Totally loved it<br />  U should defiantly get this game
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Liked this movie a lot.  Their lives were so messed up but they continued to persevere and see what's important.
140191716X|5.0|This is a beautiful and amazing inspirational resource.  Beautifully illustrated and written.......I purchased this at a store for my son and they only had one.  Once I looked through his I decided that I needed my OWN copy.  The delivery time was extremely fast and I am so grateful to have this book in my possession.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|From the moment the city of Atlantis rises from the ocean like a Phoenix, I was hooked. What an incredible concept even though the series is a spinoff from SG1, in so many ways it's even better. In a different galaxy, facing the prospect they may never be able to return home...it takes incredible people to volunteer for something like that. The acting is phenomenal, in my opinion. Joe Flanigan as Major John Sheppard starts out as a somewhat cocky loner who ends up becoming the military commander of Atlantis after tragically having to kill his commander who was being tortured by a Wraith queen. It's amazing how he transforms himself during the course of season one to adjust to his new leadership role he never sought. The mistakes he makes along the way only makes him more human. The successes he has makes him the reluctant hero. Very well done and the series only gets better over the years. It should never have been canceled.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Arrived fast and it came in perfect condition. I have watched it many times, so all I can say is I love this movie (an the book).
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Now here is an investment for you.  I can even charge my phone with this cable, no need to travel with a phone charger and  my Kindle charger this cable lets me do it all.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was breathtaking and kept me on the edge of my seat, I wish I could have read more about The minor gods or even the major gods that are never mentioned like Demeter or Perpherone
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoy the history. The characters  Were so real written that I felt like I knew them. It had been recommended by my sister and she enjoyed it as much as I did.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great acting, excellent screenplay, good soundtrack. The writer of the book and screenplay knows how to write \\"literature\\", (given the reading list in the movie, not surprising - e.g. Gatsby, Walden) nor is it surprising the script was so well written, and the cinematography so beautiful.<br /><br />What a sleeper, a joy, and deserving of at least a rental purchase if you want to go back to high school, or just visit the universal topics of friendships, family, death and suicide, sexuality, and abuse *while just watching a very pleasant, sometimes funny, often relatable, intelligent story about a particular boy who becomes a whole man in high school with the help of some really good friends who know how to love one another while having a really great time*. The main theme is love - \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\"<br /><br />In short, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Not only rent-worthy, but I would buy it.
B003W77SAS|5.0|I love this album. This was a favorite album of my late wife too. Great songs, great memories. I love this album.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|I love this movie. I love it's realism and historical correctness. the first time I watched this movie it peaked my interest in the civil war and made me want to visit the actual place this battle took place. well written well acted well directed.  5 stars all day long.
B000007ODY|4.0|I would recommend this recording. The 4th is a little slow for me and my least favorite of the four symphonies. But the other 3 symphonies are done with the master's touch.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This movie was very informative.  I read another review of someone saying that it was very one sided that these landowners jumped all over the idea of getting money... I agree that even to the average person, if presented with the possibility of making a little extra cash to catch up on bills or pay off their child's prepaid college, would be open to the idea of allowing the gas company to drill on their land.  I am sure that the gas company left out that the landowner would not be able to even use their well water for washing clothes or that they would become physically/terminally ill from the fumes.<br /><br />The facts are that these companies are using lethal chemicals to frack.  Its beyond me how in this day and age we are still so destructive to our own country not to mention our own planet.  Just disgusting!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great game. It works on the kindle fire,when it asks to download more space say yes.<br /><br />It's a nice free roam game with a good storyboard. Compared to other apps this one has to be the best.<br />What can match up to a game where you beat the snot out of baddies?
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have played several online bingo games and this is the best. I like the collections and the slots.  Lots of fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was simply fantastic. It managed to not only satisfy my love of science fiction, but kept me holding on to see Ender Wiggins progression as one of the most interesting characters I could imagine.
B004PGO25O|5.0|After reading his book, The War of Art last year, I didn't hesitate to buy this one and could not stop until I finished it.  As a lover of reading, I'm so glad that Mr. Pressfield does the work required to be a great writer--every day.<br />my thoughts,<br />Steve
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|The title grabbed my attention as did the first few chapters. Then the author seemed to go off the rails and completely lost me.
B001NLL93W|3.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br />Do not read if you haven't read the book yet/want to know big plot twists that happen!<br /><br />I both liked and disliked this book. It was very entertaining, like all of the books in this series, and a very quick read. Similar to City of Bones, I found all of the plot twists completely and annoyingly obvious and the ending a disaster. Come on, how many times and ways can the author say \\"We're not brother and sister.\\" I didn't count but it was definitely in the double digits. Clary is still the obnoxious teenager, who thinks only of herself and her feelings for Jace. Everything she does revolves around Jace. And at the end when the Angel Raziel grants her one wish, she debates wishing for world peace or and end to world hunger but decides that if those things could be wished for they would have already been wished...even though the author already said that the Angel hadn't been summoned since the first Shadowhunter...and instead she wishes to bring back her (not brother!) bf from the dead. Is it cheesy and romantic- sure. Is it the best message we want to send to young readers- maybe not. Therefore, if you prefer cheesy and romantic to generosity and morality go ahead and keep reading this series, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Very nice and works well with the Kindle Fire HD. Feels soft and works well if you are holding it for a while.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I think 2 stars for both of these books is pretty generous of me. They were both pretty bad. The story was all over the place. It was like they were always moving. They go somewhere and something happens then they go somewhere and something happens then they go somewhere and something else happens, none of it that meaningful or important. All of the stupid irrelevant details made the book just annoying and frustrating. I also felt like the characters had no real substance to them, I couldn't really relate to any of them or fully understand their motivations. And the romance? It was almost worse than Twilight. Not only was there nothing to it (they meet and all of a sudden they're in love and mated for life), but at least in Twilight we have to endure hundreds of pages of why Bella loves Edward. In this book we really don't have a clue why Diana loves Matthew, other than that she does. It must be because he's a vampire and the only thing vampires are good for is falling in love, right?
B008220D5K|4.0|Well, some of the humor was a bit juvenile, but so what?  Sometimes you need that to lift your mood these days!  Lots of laughs and more than a few scenes that couples can identify with whether they'll admit it or not.  A humorous film I'd enjoy watching more than once, for sure!
B009NG1Q96|1.0|This book was so bad it made me question my judgement of The Selection. The story picks up where it left off in the first book with America so lost and confused that I felt lost and confused reading the book. She is struggling to make self-centered decisions like, should she stay in the palace when she's not sure she loves the prince? Does she love Maxon or does she love Aspen? Even if she does love Maxon, does she want to be princess? Not to mention, all the while that there's crazy dangerous rebels after them, attacking the royal family, and leaving cryptic messages. How much time does she spend questioning that? Maybe a few paragraphs. I didn't expect for any major decisions or explanations to be tidily wrapped up in this book, but America's indecisiveness, self-centered attitude, and weak personality made this book almost intolerable. I'm not sure why I ever compared this series to The Hunger Games. This book confirmed that America Singer is no Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />The entire book I waited for her to fight, to make a stand, which she occasionally did...but then she regretted it later and apologized profusely for her actions. What kind of message is that supposed to send to readers? You should fight for what you believe in but only if you take it back later?<br /><br />Her emotions were so up and down and inconsistent it was not only confusing but frustratingly irritating. Regarding the love triangle, I was pro-Maxon until about halfway through this book when every one of America's doubts and fears about their relationship was proven to be true. Yes, he has been lying to her. Yes, he is leading the other girls on as well. Yes, he will punish law-breakers even if they break the stupidest of laws. And she knows all of this! She gets about a page worth of anger and angst every time and tells him she wants to leave. Then a page later she's wanting to kiss him and apologizing and going on and on about how much she truly loves him. Again, what kind of message is that for readers either? True love means lies? Or true love means the boy who's loved you his whole life and will do anything to protect you and be there for you? According to this book, boys like Aspen are only there so you can feel good about yourself when the prince ignores you for the other girls.<br /><br />I had such high expectations for this book and am severely disappointed. I hope the series gets better in the next book, but I most definitely will not be continuing to follow it.s that for readers either? True love means lies?

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Within self-imposed limits on the fantasy worlds he writes about, his imagination has proven boundless-again.  Mr. Gaiman's heros are just normal, basically good people who end up tested by wondrous, bizarre, often over-the top challenges, and find the virtue and courage to overcome them. &#34;Scary&#34;, &#34;heartwarming&#34;, &#34;rude&#34;, and even &#34;inspiring&#34; fit &#34;Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34;. Also, his writing is always excellent, and for what it is worth, he has to be about the best audiobook reader out there.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book was a very interesting and entertaining read. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has an interest in zombies or the zombie apocalypse. It is much different from the movie, as it is written as more of a collection of short stories as the main character interviews different survivors from all over the world after the apocalypse is over to discover the different methods used to survive. Some are terrifying, some are heartbreaking, and some are just plain cool to read about.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Nice to have a portable back up option for my kindle reader.  Color is cool too.  Only 4 stars because not as easy to navigate as my kindle is.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a master of mystery and suspense. If you're looking for something dark and twisted- look no further! Gillian Flynn's books have it all, including plot twists at the end so demented they're perfect.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I wish there were more than 10 levels though.  When's the update coming out?  Soon, I hope!  Thanks....
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I enjoyed this book much more than the first. I think the author has shown much more creativity and is developing her own style rather than borrowing themes and plots from other best-sellers. I also didn't find the characters as whiny in this book, but maybe they're just growing on me. Although this book is written in 2nd person point of view, the perspective still shifts periodically between the characters, allowing readers insight into not only Clary's emotions but also Jace, Simon, and even Alec, which may help readers more closely identify with them. I like where the story is going (although before reading this one I did have to look up some of the plot surprises...sorry but I didn't want to keep reading a series about incest). So, even though I know parts of what will happen in the next book, I'm still excited to keep reading!
B001FB0WBK|2.0|I saw Tommy Emmanuel for the first time on a Marty Stuart show.  He was fantastic so I wanted to get one of his videos.  This video was a dissapointment.  He has someone else playing along with him on the harmonica for most songs and that was a big distraction from Tommy's guitar playing.  I get more enjoyment watching clips on YouTube than from this video.  Also, I was looking forward to hearing him play Amazing Grace as he does on YouTube.  Again, a huge disappointment!  I do not recommend wasting your money on this DVD.  Just watch him on YouTube instead.
B009YN2M7S|2.0|I'm not really a fan of Nicholas Sparks. My mother asked me to read this book so we could see the movie together. I find his writing too sappy and predictable. And the twist at the end- so completely out of left field. It didn't fit with anything else in the book or make any sense at all. I guess I just don't understand why the story would reflect a real life situation and real life scenarios and then randomly throw in a supernatural being.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|If you are a fan of ZZ Top this is a must have. The digital versions of the albums are so damn good. Great sound for a great band. And you can not beat the price. What other group you know would put a price this low on a set like this. BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
B000FC130E|3.0|This book was very entertaining and well written, I just couldn't really get into it or invested in any of the characters. The dark and gloomy setting became boring for me after a few chapters.
B00620OANU|5.0|haha.. I find myself not doing other things to watch these episodes.  I started with Season 1 and have watched each episode and subsequent season 'religiously'.  I'm very attached to the characters and enjoy the show too much!!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I have a lot of mixed emotions after reading this book. While I did enjoy parts of it, there was just something missing that I can't explain. My biggest problem with the story was how annoying the characters are, especially in the first half of the story. I had to constantly remind myself that this is a Young Adult book and the first in a series so perhaps the author is giving herself plenty of room for their growth. They are all basically self-absorbed obnoxious teenagers, most especially the main character, Clary. Clary is annoyingly immature for a sixteen-year-old. She, of course, has all of the boys in the story in love with her (except for the gay who she's mean to! So sad, she could have had a gay bff, that would have made the story more interesting) but she's too focused on herself to even be aware of other character's emotions. She also gets very frustrated and emotional quickly and yells things like \\"I don't want to hear any more!\\" when essential parts of the story are being explained. Even in Young Adult books, I still like my female leads with a little bit more strength and gumption then what Clary showed in this book.<br /><br />The plot itself is interesting, and the concept of Shadowhunters and Downworlders was what kept me reading after I lost interest in the characters. The twists in the storyline were blatantly obvious... And they were all obvious because they've all been done before. If you've seen Star Wars or read Harry Potter then there's no point in reading this book.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I don't usually like to read. But I could not put this down. Can't wait to read the next. So exciting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is such a useful app for kindle users. Users of all ages will find this app, easy on the eyes, versatile, large enough print to read and understandibly widely used by any generation of users who downloads it to their own kindle! It 's great!
B000000OU0|5.0|Love the CD , the Eagles are my favorite band of all time , their music never gets old and my children like them now as well!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loved book two even more than book one. Wonderful read and true to his previous book there are unexpected twists and turns. Can't wait to read book three and see what else could happen in the realm.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this kind of point and click escape game. I just wish it didn't reset the puzzls when you back out of that puzzle's immediate screen. Otherwise would have been five stars. Worth the play through.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old version was easy and I could look at the temps and radar maps with no problem.  The new version takes me 5 times as long to get the info and I'm not liking it at all!
B0045INOCO|5.0|This show shows how insane humanity can be. But the bigger message is what can be accomplished when one is completely committed to a cause without reservation.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Though somewhat disjointed at times this is a story of the lives of many easterners and Afgans and the love and loss over several years.  It emphasized that what is seen on the surface of an individual is not necessicerally what is inside.  Many lessons to learn.  Well written..
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works as described and predicts words well. I like that I can compose a message without even having to touch a letter based on the words offered by the prediction.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|12 Monkeys was one my first DVDs , way back in 1999 , but sadly it has suffered a decease called laser rot,which was very very common with &#34; Laserdiscs&#34; , I am so glad that was able two procure this blu ray copy , For for fans of 1980s - 90s Gilliam films . If<br />12 Monkeys HD is still available grab it , I could be wrong but it out of print in a lot of countries and looks like it is in North America .<br />I am hoping they will release a super &#34; Special Edition &#34; . I am pretty sure &#34; Amazon &#34; will notify everyone , until then grab this one…
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent, page turning &#34;big imagination&#34; tale supremely thought out. Great characters. Well-crafted prose. Highly recommended for classic sci-fi and future-set action/adventure fans.
1608871819|5.0|Yes, it is , With close scrutiny , besides the three Dimensional S . There is even small emboss glyph's covering the rest of this handsome.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Great incentive to lose weight - best book on subject so far in my 65 years. Went cold turkey and cut out all carbs - rice potato pasta and bread and flour products - brilliant have lost 13 lbs already since June 20 and that is with a few reds here and there and small 65% chocolate pieces each night as a treat.

No arthritic aches - have just about ceased taking Nexium (hiatus hernia at the O junction) - no wind no rashes and more get up- and go. Have recommended it to so many people!! I am responsible for your sales going up!!!!<br /><br />Here's to shit wheat and wheat products.<br /><br />Thank you thank you thank you<br /><br />Jude
B0064X7FVE|4.0|We love the app! We are still getting used to the updated version, which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. We use it every day instead of staying up each night watching the weather on tv. Thanks for the app!!
B001BANK32|5.0|Dis book gud I luv. Book book. Nake mehapyp and feelgus space when mushroom do teh dirty dance all night
B0081336FO|5.0|I really enjoyed this short lived series. Funny I didn't watch it when it originally aired.  The good shows get taken off tv but the trashy things get left on.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Hvorostovsky continues to top all other performers.  He becomes Onegin from the haughty, superior attitude to the<br />the pleading for another chance in the finale.  Fleming is sweet and starry eyed until she shows strength in rejecting<br />Onegin to remain faithful to  Lenski.  Vargas plays Lenski with sensitivity and the anger and disillusionment in his<br />friend, Onegin, leads to the duel.  I love this opera and I hope to see it live at the Met this season.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I'd anticipated seeing this movie, for quite a while, only to be disappointed. I'm not a horror movie buff although I can appreciate a good movie and this just wasn't it. I almost didn't write a review, for this movie, out of embarrassment over how badly I wanted to see it. For one thing Jessica Chastain's hair color was too distracting.. there just wasn't a purpose for it or most of the characteristics of her character. The kids were charming, the plot had promise for that of a horror flick and it simply had too many wholes in the story. The build up of the movie was greater than the movie itself. If I had a choice between this movie and something else I would watch a replay of Orphan which didn't have a monster and was scarier. However, if a cable station were to air this movie I would watch it again.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Scenery is nice but the plot is weak and the whole pace of the movie is slow. I realize it is a movie about old people but could we move it along and include a little more character development? The obstinacy of Reggie lasts too long and is unreasonable considering the length of his marriage (9 hrs) to Jean. Just sluggish and predictable. Beyond that, the director/producer found it necessary to insert the f-word twice when it was totally unnecessary. Does Hollywood think they can't make an adult movie without gratuitously throwing-in unnecessary foul language? What, did you need a more restricted rating or something?<br /><br />Wait till Quartet is available for free so you can feel better about turning it off.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|i was hoping that they would go to earth and then defeat the aliens there, that laST ALIEN didn't last very long,  the man burnt at the entrance to the ship did more harm then the alien, i trully didn't like the movie enough to pay 13.00 bucks, over priced, noce senery though, i know bad spelling.
B0073Q0DZG|3.0|We expected more from the all star cast.  Scenery nice and bird pics better than actors.  We would have watched a free version but would not have rented had we known in advance.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|It's a good all round conversion but does require random restarts and doesn't stream in HD. As it stands it's a slightly above average way to view twitch content.
0451232852|5.0|I loved Fall Of Giants.  The historical settings were very interesting to me, and the cast of characters were believable.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Where is app for candy crush saga?  what good is a help guide without game?<br />thanks but no thanks don't need this.
B0083Z614S|4.0|this is an old favorite a children's book maybe but i did enjoy rereading now and it was very restful a plaesant escape back to simpler times
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book surprised me. I was referred to it and it took me by surprise. I chewed through this book like any fantasy book that I liked. Can this happen in our future? I would like to think so in a way, being an avid gamer my self I enjoyed the ideas and possibility of the whole book. Great read.<br />iGrOfTy.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I can hardly stop watching this show, have to get caught up so that I can watch the new series. This show is something real and interesting each time I watch. It has interpersonal relationships that they are secretive about so that you want to watch to see what happens next. Also each show has something that could happen in the law that might happen to anyone that you know.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome<br /><br />this game is the best you get to ride horses you get to be in competitions this is fun it feels like you are in the game you get to take care of your horses its way more better than any other game
B003TQ50V6|5.0|One of the best features about this film is the effort made by the producers to accurately select firearms that were actually around in the 1880s.  Hollywood is finally realizing that the authenticity of a film is destroyed by arming the actors with weapons that would not be invented for several years after the time period being portrayed.  Too, the cast seemed to be having a great time making the movie.
B000002KET|5.0|This is an essential album for any Sabbath fan. Its not as good as the first three but it's pretty good.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Start by saying, I'm a really big fan of Michael Crichton's original stories, and, I also loved the movies! Also, I love sim games. So...this is pretty good so far, especially for a free game. Great graphics and sound effects. Moves along fairly quickly. I like the missions offered by storyline characters. I recommend this game to all fans of the Sims! It's quite fun...and addictive. As an amendment to my original opinion, I'm rather disappointed that the dollar packs are SO expensive in actual real cash. Who would pay $99.99 for anything in a free game?!? I realize the fairness to the game makers in spending a few dollars for extra stuff. Let's be realistic, the prices are outrageous. Therefore, I amend my original 5 Stars to three stars.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new format can be  difficult to navigate. The old format was much simpler and user friendly. The current radar maps  in particular.
1612680011|5.0|Making room on my keeper shelf! Every teenager in the world should read this book, then they should read it again in college, then again later in life, and then pass it on to their kids. Seriously the info in the book can change lives.
0880796863|4.0|My son asked me to order this item for him.  This particular Edition was what he was searching for.  He seemed quite pleased with it.
B009ETEEAU|1.0|I received the order very quickly and it came in a decent packaging. After a quick hour or so charge the camera was fully charged. so I did a video on youtube riding my motorcycle. the mounts given in the packaging aren't that great. the strap is only about 8 inches long as is probably meant just for bike helmets. the other two mounts are ok but wiggle very easily and need to be tightened down very firmly to hold them in place. the next day I went to the local water park and filmed about 5 minutes spread over about 45 mins. to save battery life (which only lasts for about an hour) I shut off the camera when I wasn't filming. The cameras screen shuts off by itself after about 2mins even during recording. the screen is really hard to make out in the daylight and next to impossible if the sun is over your shoulder. After the 5 mins or so of video recording I switch it over to take a few photos.....at that point the camera froze after takin only 3 pictures. nothing is fixing the problem. theres is a reset button on the bottom of the camera....that does nothing. this camera sucks. the price is great but seriously don't waste your time with this one.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this dramatic and beautiful personal account and running lesson. It has  changed my life forever.  From th  way I run to th  way I eat is now better in many ways.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good character development. Interesting twists.  Age a little unbelievable. Would recommend to young readers. I enjoyed the unpredictable story line.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This movie is fun for everyone. If you need cheering up just put Monsters Inc. on and be prepared to feel better.
B00CDUVDEC|2.0|Phil Anselmo is back/arrives with his long anticipated? solo release. Unfortunately, all it is is a bunch of noise. You can make your music as heavy as you want, but if it doesn't sound good, then what is the point? I may have been more impressed with this if I was an angry teenager who was just trying to annoy neighbors by blasting this garbage, but this album doesn't click with me now that I'm in my early 30s.<br /><br />If anything, this album further proves that Phil was the weak link in Pantera, with his idiotic lyrics and juvenile posturing. It was much easier to take when he was riding the coat tails of the Abbott brothers.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love this movie. Classic. If you haven't seen you I suggest getting it today. If you don't big it at least watch t once...
B00821PCJS|3.0|Strong acting by most of the cast, for example Will Patton, helps to overcome the predictable and tired story line.
B00DU74U74|2.0|IMHO BORING! I suppose if I hadn't read the book, I *might* have watched the whole movie. But as much as I tried, I got so darned bored that I was glad I rented it for half off at Redbox. I gave up, ejected it & am so disappointed. So slow, so meh. The book is so much better.  I found the movie disjointed & did I say boring?.....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint, if you are a Downton Abbey addict, settle down on the couch or recliner and enjoy...
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Although many may remember the Indiana corn field scene when they think of this film, it is scenes like the camera shot from the top of the United Nations building that could be on a museum wall with other great art.  This shows Hitchcock for the incredible visual artist that he was.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Somehow I took a wrong turn and exited the streaming and then couldn't get it back!  Wish I could have seen the entire program!
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is both prolific and dependable.  I have read almost every one of his works, and they predictably great, without exception.  So is this. His style is like an old friend.  Comfortable as an old cardigan.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|After seeing Governor Arnold on the beach in California, I didn't think he could get back into shape to do this kind of picture.  Boy was  I wrong Welcome Back Arny
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This Slender man game is fun. Young's get to select 2 kinds of places to find the pages before slender gets your but. Its not that such of a scary game. But I like it! You might want to download this if you like<br />slender games!
B004HAEGP4|2.0|I was right, after the first movie they should have put this story to bed because this one put me to sleep
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Amazing screen play, actors seemingly born for their roles and amazingly well shot. Just nothing not perfect about this movie.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Don't get this app it Sucks without the game!!!!! GET PORTAL 2 OR HALF LIFE 2!!!!! GOOD NIGHT!!!!!<br />Go home and work on the real game AMAZON!!!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Really good movie and story. 5 stars because of language. Why do they have to use so much cursing? Other than that,  I really liked the movie.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good graphics, and a hint button for when you get stuck.  And it has an interesting storyline.  I liked the notebook that you can flip back through to refresh your memory if you have been away from the game for a couple of days.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Lovely ensemble cast and well directed by Dustin Hoffmann.  Also a hoot to seem Dame Gwyneth in this film, acting and singing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I swear when I read this book the rest of the world becomes muted. It is truly a work if art. Even though I beleive the show does do the book justice there is nothing like diving into the details of a story in a book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting my friend and i challenge each other to see who can get to level 10 fastest I WON!!!!! just finished it today sooo proud!
0385349947|5.0|I recommend that every young women age 14-40 read this book. A fun, very inspiring, very motivating book that is also a quick read.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The DEMO is great but I'm not paying 10 bucks for one app. If they lowered it to 5 bucks then I'd buy it
B007THA4FI|3.0|It runs a bit long at times, and sort of feels like a preachy rant about class & poverty.  A whole lot of muggle drama, but picks up near the end.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|While reading the Alchemist, I felt connected to God in a very special way,,,realizing color, race, religion has placed a very negative aspect in our daily thoughts. It doesn't have to be this way.<br /><br />I feel everyday as many people who agree to should pray for the USA and all souls in all of the world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good game a little lagging but all in all good. Would recommend. Like the minnons.... too cute! Love thm guys!
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|I'm listening to Disk 2 again (A Minor Jam) as I write this review.  I'm not going to repeat what the positive reviewers have said already.  What they said.  I'm just happy to add this edition to my ABB library.  I had no qualms about ordering the Super Deluxe Brothers and Sisters without waiting for a review (just like I did when purchasing Fillmore East February, 1970) and, after listening to it several times, I have no regrets about purchasing this product.  I don't expect perfection, I just like listening to the ABB.  It's a great feeling to think that in the 21st century, I still get to hear ABB tracks that I haven't heard before (I really can't be bothered with the bootlegs).  And I think this super deluxe version of Brothers and Sisters is just bloody marvelous.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Well, it's pretty good. The only thing is slendy doesn't look the same and sorta wasnt scary. But it has 2 levels so that's good.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|Contains almost every game in the Metal Gear series restored in beautiful HD.  Only con against this collection is the need to separately download a few of the titles from the PS store as they are not physically on the disk.  Comes with a code that gets you these games for free, but seems lazy it wasn't just included on the physical disk.  Other than that no complaints, comes with many games that have never been given a review below 9.5.
B005HEPS6A|4.0|It is very good entertainment. The story lines are very pointed for us today.<br />The character seen true even in real world.
0765325950|1.0|Overall the book was a disappointment. The story, characters, and general feeling do not hold consistent with the writing of RJ and even BS's previous two books. The real change here is the feeling of incompleteness and inconsistency and emptiness, that really leaves you feeling short-changed and let down. If you are a WOT fan of course you will read the final novel and draw your own conclusions. But if you are chiefly interested in a good read, stick to Robert Jordan's books and enjoy the beginning not the ending, making your own ending is better than the Brandon Sanderson ending, and cheaper.
B008MM9630|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game so far. I like that you earn gems fairly regularly so you don't have to buy them. Of course you can buy things but you don't have to in order to play . I am having trouble connecting to Facebook which is why I only gave 4 stars. Once that's fixed I'll bump up to 5 stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very intriguing game. With its mastery of conundrums and riddles I was blown away and amazed. Usually I go for gameloft type games but when I saw this game in the kindle store something drew me closer and closer. It has stunning graphics combined with an interesting story. YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER GAME LIKE THIS ON THE MARKET. Please make a sequel because I hate cliff hangers. WE ALL WANT MORE.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey!!! Love this series! The story, the character's, the actors! I will have to start all over, cuz I cannot wait for season 4!  :)
B00CW665VI|5.0|Just going to say this was one was one of best books I read all year. Histarical beyond words. Loved that was all in his POV and you get the entire relationship. Emma chase was brilliant with her writing and thought process. Oh god I haven't laughed this hard from a book in a long time. I absolutely loved Thanksgiving.......i laughed for 20 minutes solid. Great book and it has an Hea.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app is the bomb! It's all the cuteness and lovability of the minions! <3 You should get this app(:
0739352989|4.0|The CD's were what I ordered, but the box was a little dinged up and looked used. But the CD's themselves were in good condition.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Good book read it when you don't have much to do. I recommend it for a summer reading program for high school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I. Love it very fun and entertaining. Like temple run but better and its got minions. Get this game you will love it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game gives clues which you must logically connect to attain items, which are used to get - ultimately, door unlocking devices. The theme is repeated with increasing difficulty as you progress. Clever use of environmental objects keeps you interested and engaged.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Story line can be a bit slow at times but understand that it is needed sometimes to explain later events.  Have absolutely loved the story and characters!  Bravo!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great story. Keeps you hopeful and eager for the next chapter. Rich and realistic characters are fleshed out and believable. I was hypnotized.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche's new self-titled 2013 album fits right in with their previous works such as Rage for Order, Operation Mindcrime, and Empire.  The new singer Todd La Torre has an amazing voice.  I have been listening to this album non-stop and my favorites are &#34;Where Dreams Go To Die&#34;, &#34;Redemption&#34;, &#34;Spore&#34;, &#34;In This Light&#34;, and &#34;Fallout&#34;.  If you love the Queensryche sound of the 80's, you definitely need to buy this album.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is good for kids 6 and up this is a sequel to the Percy Jackson books<br />I love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game!! hard but easy all at the same time!! download this game, if u dont like it delete... but u will like it!!!!
B002U3CBZM|5.0|So often in this genre an author throws out many many breadcrumbs at the start of a novel and then later picks up only the relevant few. Think of &#34;Lost&#34; and how the little mysteries intrigued you at forts and then annoyed then hell out of because they were never explained.<br />I loved how Richard Morgan avoided this trap. Every detail made sense. Every interesting bit of color that at first seemed only there to paint the backdrop of his imagined future, had relevance to the central story.<br />Altered Carbon is such a great story, the backdrop is Blade Runner dark future and the style, while playing on iconic noir fiction plot lines, extends them and lifts them up into something better.<br />Read it in one sitting and then went back and read it again..
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Glad I waited for product thru internet.  It was good, but not worth a movie ticket.  Worth renting on internet or red box
B008JFUPZI|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and absolutely loved it. It was filmed slightly different than most movies I've seen which was very cool, and Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges did a phenomenal job.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|really a good action flick. Cost on internet was cheaper then on Dish.  Worth renting if you like action movies
B000OF352Q|5.0|I admit that I only got interested in reading \\"Vanity Fair\\" after watching the BBC dramatization [[ASIN:B000089QEN Vanity Fair]] several years ago. It wasn't an easy read, but what a revelation into the workings of English society at the time. William Makepeace Thackeray's work focuses on the adventures, or rather misadvenures of two British women, Rebecca Sharp and Amelia Sedley, and traces their ups and downs till the 1830s. Both women are total opposites in character and make for a compelling character study, and the secondary characters enhance the storytelling with all of their flaws and dramatics. A keen-eyed satirist, Thackeray critiques the society of the time with perceptive observations and I was captivated by the detailed commentaries in the form of an engaging narrative. I have since come to consider \\"Vanity Fair\\" one of my favorite works in English literature, and was happy to note that Charlotte Brontë herself was an admirer, dedicating her second edition of \\"Jane Eyre\\" to Mr. Thackeray.<br /><br />I purchased the Easton Press' 1979 leather-bound edition with moire endpapers recently and love this gorgeous keepsake edition. It is part of Easton Press' The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written series and contains 200 drawings made by the author for the first edition. I hadn't realized Mr. Thackeray was such an accomplished artist! The drawings or sketches are truly a delight to peruse. Given that this is quite a hefty tome, I appreciated the satin ribbon marker, a nice touch, and found in all the leather-bound editions published by the Easton Press. I shall enjoy gazing upon this beautiful edition and perusing its contents whenever I feel like it while my well-thumbed paperback with all of its annotations serves as my reading copy.
B0000C1733|5.0|We love this album.  It has great songs on it and many I didn't even realize they had made.  We really enjoy listening to it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandson really loves the game & wants to play it all the time. I usually have to take the Kindle away from him.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is a blast to play and I am so glad that I chose to download it and recommend it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love this show.  Everything about the show is well done.  The acting is incredible and watching it on my TV through my WII is an added plus.  I'm hooked on Amazon Prime.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I bought the novel, &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane,&#34; with blind enthusiasm, as I do for any Neil Gaiman work which I haven't yet enjoyed.  His ability to target stories at certain readers has always startled, and delighted me.  I consider myself to be a sophisticated participant of fantasy and allegory and escapism of any type, but I am never put off when I realize that Neil's stages are set for readers of all ages.<br />  This story, to me, is about the inevitable progress of self awareness.  A young boy martials with magical beings to balance the worlds of reality and unreality...and told from the remembrance of the grown man he becomes, it allows us to ponder which is which.  On the other hand, it's a wonderful way to lose oneself on any level.  Thanks Neil!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so addictive.  And even though I didn't like how the season ended I'll still be back for season 4.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are great and so are the free coins. I like that it's free cause most games like this are $1.99. I don't like the way you only get 30 seconds. But other than that this game is awesome. Characters are good cars are cool. This game is a lot like Mario kart Wii.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had this app before on my kindle and I loved it but it kept freezing up on me.  Now I can play it again with no problems
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Reading this helped me understand in a better way, what friends and family have gone through with 'mini-strokes'.  Little by little parts of the brain have been affected.  I've observed personality changes, behavior changes along with the physical affects.  The list of suggestions at the back of the book were very helpful!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Saw this at the movie theater and had to own it! Great job Disney, this movie really gave a great understanding of the original!
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|I remember this being in the news, but wasn't totally aware of what went on.  What a great story of people of different groups coming together for a common cause and meeting with success.
1551113082|5.0|Shipping was fast, price great, superior condition. This book is the one to get, after reading informed lit reviewers. It proved to be just what we needed.
B00BS07HSO|4.0|Beautiful and descriptive writing. Having lived in that part of the world 50 years ago and the words painted a wonderful picture of the countryside and people. A sensitive subject treated with grace,
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|The best search engine. I use it constantly and never have a problem finding hat I need. I recommend it.
B00AFPVPDG|4.0|A good book for attacking how to learn something quickly.  You won't have all the mastery that 10,000 hours brings, but if you are looking for a quick way to learn something this book provides a great framework for learning something new.<br /><br />Josh gives you a step-by-step approach to acquire knowledge on what you want to learn that involves research and experiential learning.  He walks you through the framework first and then illustrates it with several different examples from programming to playing an instrument.<br /><br />Check this book out, I think you will like it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Love having the extra information with Accuweather Platinum on my Kindle HD Fire. Very convenient being able to check the weather while reading. Thanks Amazon !
B002TXZT7K|5.0|Like the other books in this series by Alexander McCall Smith I found it to be a most enjoyable read suited for people who like a light hearted view of life from another perspective, in this case the ladies of Botswana. Westerners will sympathise with the perpetual dilemma of how to make enough money to live which is the norm in third world countries. The ladies in this detective series are quite ingenuous and creative in their ideas of developing businesses where they see a need, in this case a typing school for men. They reason that with the introduction of computers it is now the men who need to learn to type rather than relying solely on their secretaries. The plan goes very smoothly until an unfortunate relationship develops and suddenly everything becomes unstuck.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have a short story that I want to publish. This gave me all of the info I need to complete the task.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The movie was good and cleverly done, but the book has much needed detail to fill out the story. I recommend it to everyone even if you haven't seen the movie. The issue for humanity is how we can be smart (technologically) and yet stupid (sociologically) and what does it mean for our collective future. Read it!
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|...and definitely a must-read for anyone looking to improve their finances. It goes very deep and those principles can be applayed in other areas of your life too.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I really like action, science-fiction, Los Angeles, and the Marine Corp.  If this were a real situation, I believe the Marines could handle it very well, and the film was entertaining.  The people in this movie just wouldn't give up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is superbly done.  The actors make all the characters come alive.  It is hard to wait for each new episode.  The stories are compelling and pull you into the plot.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway. All in all, it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England. More such dramas should be presented on TV.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|ok
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Funny, not over the top! Bruce Willis is fabulous as us Helen Mirren. Can't wait to see the next movie
B00D6C0D42|5.0|I should have waited to type this review as I wanted time to reflect on this great, odd, frightening movie before trying to write about it five minutes after finishing it for the first time. Obviously, with movies like Brazil one needs not only to reflect, but also watch it again, sometimes even again before one can properly \\"review\\" it.<br /><br />  Either way I believe this was a great movie; it reminded me of Kafka's The Trial, mixed with a little Jacobs Ladder and possibly even Pink Floyds The Wall, probably strange comparisons I'm sure but as I said I JUST finished watching this movie and it leaves you with a LOT to think about; the only reason I chose to write this is because I am the first person here....<br />  I know I haven't really said much because I honestly am not too sure what to say - I also dislike reviews that give away the plot-yes this movie has one- of a movie - but being able to be the first person to review this film compelled me to write this.<br />  Anyway, if you like strange, absurd, nightmarish movies full of symbolism and metaphor, allegory and satire, movies that demand a second viewing, then Brazil is for you.....
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This has always been and remains my favorite of Marian's books and the most memorable. I read this when it first came out many years ago and still remember the story like it was yesterday, it was that good. A potentially dark subject really well written and took you on a journey as if you were right there with Rachel.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|Entertaining &amp; fun!!!!! This is a fun and easy game to play. Just challenging enough but not frustrating.  Time flys by.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Firstly, I must record my absolute love of Peter Jackson's &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; movies.  Having been a fan of Tolkien's masterpiece long before hint of the movies ever reached Hollywood, I'm an obnoxious stickler for accuracy when it comes to portrayals of the iconic Middle-Earth, and Jackson remained true to the spirit of the original LOTR epic.  (Yes, I'm one of THOSE Tolkien fans.)  ;-)<br /><br />...Hey, you write enough academic papers on the subject, and you'll be a stickler, too.<br /><br />That said, Jackson utterly drops the ball with &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; and largely because he is such an excellent film-maker.  (Wait, I'll explain.)  The Lord of the Rings trilogy was meant to be a huge, dramatic, larger-than-life epic, full of heroism and villainy, love and war and passion...  And Jackson delivers.<br /><br /> &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; on the other hand, was meant to be a light-hearted childrens' tale.  It was ONE story, but Jackson just can't resist the idea of creating another long, drawn-out, nine-hour marathon.  By pulling in useless information from Tolkien's appendices and adding CGI effects ad nauseam, Jackson is trying to create a second Lord of the Rings when there just isn't enough information to work with.<br /><br />The end result:  a film that is visually stunning but utterly untrue to the original &#34;there and back again&#34; spirit of Tolkien's classic tale.  Like George Lucas, Jackson should have left his own legacy alone.
0345803493|3.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy of 50 Shades! There were a lot of twists in the books, which I like, but it was not written very well, grammatically. That didn't stop me from reading every single one! LOL it was entertaining.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've followed &#34;Supernatural&#34; since the beginning and am still just as hooked now as I was then.  The show was one of my great favorites during my college years and provided a welcome escape from the ever-present research papers and homework assignments...  There's nothing quite like a clever urban fantasy--just &#34;real&#34; enough to be faintly plausible and just fantastical enough to fire the imagination...<br /><br />Over the years, the leading actors have greatly refined their performances, and the storytellers still manage to &#34;up the ante&#34; with every season.  Perhaps one of the most commendable aspects of the show is the writers' willingness to shake things up.  Each season's finale expands and alters the show's complex mythology, leaving the audience wondering just how the next season's premiere will possibly manage to extricate the two heroes from their latest predicament.<br /><br />Monsters, mayhem, angels, demons...  This show has it all!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What an incredible end to an incredible series.  The scale of the battles, the human connections, the fate of the world in the balance.  I've never felt so emotionally invested in a book before.
0446569895|3.0|Overall a fun read, though I wish he remembered more of the crazy tour antics or the process of recording these great albums, or the 80's....HAHAHA.  It's Ozzy; it ain't no Shakespeare!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This lovely tapestry of family love transcends time and continents.  The characters are more than believable; they are familiar and intriguing at the same time. It is a delightful journey that I recommend to all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm app. I have various settings for different days and hours to awake. The early morning alarm for weekdays is the Rooster crowing. It gets louder until I wake up and either dismiss it, or snooze the alarm. The second line of defense is to make sure I am managing my morning by the cheeping of a bird. My last alarm for the morning is a song from my mp3 list.<br /><br />I enjoy the flexibility and ease of use. The sound is effective as I am sure my neighbors can attest to. I can set an alarm or use a stop watch or use it for a kitchen timer. What is not to like?
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Really like this series usually watch 2 or 3 episodes a night, time permitting. It is cutting into my reading time.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I love reading Follett and actually can't believe I paid for this one. Too many characters and more about the war than the development of the characters which Follett does so well typically.  Very disappointed and would not recommend.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a very well written show.  The second season was even better than the first season.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I really like this game, it's very addictive and get a little harder each level. For 99 cents it's well worth it.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Once again I bought this book based on the excellent ratings from other customers of Amazon and I am so pleased I did as this book is amazing. I was also looking for a trilogy again having loved The Girl with The Dragon Tatoo and also the Hunger Games Trilogy.<br /><br />I really loved the story of Wool it was unique and had me guessing right to the end!. Could not put this down absolute page turner. Recommended to my husband who also thought it was an excellent read.<br /><br />Personally I am drawn to post apocalyptic books and this was very different spin which I enjoyed. It was the politics between people living in close proximity that I really enjoyed.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of those movies I will watch over and over. Clever and funny for adults - it makes me want to cook (or at least eat great food)!
B002KKCVR8|4.0|sandal fits good and is comfortable. time will tell if it holds up.<br />works good in water. straps are comfortable
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Meg Ryan is of course just a perfectly delightful doll. She's the stressed out career chick who gives it all up for love. But it doesn't feel like she's surrendering her freedom or anything sinister like that. She's ditching a really, really crappy job (marketing research designed to figure out ways of selling people more junk), to have a meaningful life (and yes, it's with a gorgeous guy). Also, Hugh Jackman shows that being a Gentleman (with a capital &#34;G&#34;!!) NEVER goes out of style.
B00365EVWE|4.0|Great item! Nice sound quality n perfect noise attenuation.<br /><br />It would be greater if it comes with a carrying pouch or cable coiler. Anyway,it's a great item after all. I love it!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I showed this movie to my 11th grade English class after they read the book. It added interesting twists and insight into why, perhaps, McCandless left on his own personal journey. The students enjoyed it.
1476734941|5.0|This seems to make more sense to me than many of the more complicated plans.  I am still reading and considering the plan of action.  It appears straight forward and easy to follow
B008602KQI|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS JUST AS AWESOME AS \\"I AM NUMBER FOUR\\". SO SYMBOLIC OF REAL LIFE, PEOPLE SCRAMBLING TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP , NOT CARING WHO THEY CRUSH ON THEIR WAY UP AND SOME MAKING OTHER PEOPLE MISERABLE OUT OF HATE OR SHEER ENTERTAINMENT. REALLY GOOD MOVIE. CRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES LOL.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|is a very useful application with many featuresin great sync your files with your pc. recommended as the best app for productivity
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is awesome and really good I play it for hours or until I run out of coins . You should  definitely buy this game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found the game fun as well as a challenge. I enjoyed playing the game but I thought it could have be longer with more levels. However I've noticed all download pay games seem to be getting shorter. What's up with that
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is a great game. Its free. free updates  just free everything from the first time you get it . Its awesome
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|megalodon shark is awesome and the great white shark all the sharks are very angry to fish need to swim and sharks need to eat that's want sharks need to do so I like the game because the megalodon is a beast you can eat people and fish and boats and EVERYTHING and sharks need to eat people and fish and EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!! but you can't eat Fire i got the laser the that is a FRKING!!!!!!! laser it shots EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i got the laser on the megalodon head i got the laser on all the sharks head but I don't know how to get the baby megalodon it's so not easy it costs to many gems that's why i can't get the baby megalodon shark!! i want the baby megalodon to cost coins and you can also eat a giant crab in hungry shark evolution
B004EPYZXK|2.0|I gave it a chance even after reading the bad reviews, don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|The attitudes they gave the main characters were great! Very refreshing take on the story, but there a few parts of the story line that were &#34;gimmies,&#34; and showed that someone had too tight a grip on the obvious. Still worth watching many times.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Bee Gees Music will forever live on... There music is iconic... It's so nice to go back in time while listening to them.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|Lived up to every Die Hard ever made, and the addition of...oops...no spoilers here. It's a really great movie, and Willis does not disappoint at all.
B008220BLG|4.0|In the long annals of walking dead fiction, \\"Warm Bodies\\" is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole \\"I want to eat your brains\\" thing, that is.<br /><br />Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, \\"Warm Bodies\\" may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" \\"Zombieland\\" and \\"Fido\\" got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" template to the genre (his name is \\"R\\" and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel).<br /><br />Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little \\"home\\" for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the \\"Scary\\" movie franchise or \\"Date Movie\\" and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead).<br /><br />Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.<br /><br />It's nice to be reminded of that every now and again.the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead).<br /><br />Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film.

B00594XOZU|3.0|I have been using it for a couple of months now. All of a sudden my Kindle Fire is telling me &quot;Kik messenger has stopped&quot;
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Feynman is my favourite physicist (I am a chemist). What a wonderful, unusual and talented man both scientifically (Nobel prize) and as a person he was. A more non-professorial professor is hard to imagine! Thiis book is a fascinating collection of short tales by him, scientific and otherwise, and is to be heartily recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is lots of fun! I would recommend to anyone! Download and try this game. Especially to horse lovers!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really need more rooms! More. More. More. Loved it but need more!!! Please give us more rooms already! It just needs more rooms and then 5 stars!
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I, Alexis, could Never could get the movie to show on the computer I have at my grandma and poppys house.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|On a single listen of &#34;Red Hands&#34; on a local radio station, I took a chance and got &#34;R.E.V.O.&#34; A wiki search gave me some more information about the young Canadian band whose motto is &#34;Realize every victory outright,&#34; which explained the album's title. They have an infectious blend of voices and instrumentation supporting solid songwriting. If you like power pop, neo-folk, or stomp you will go for Walk Off The Earth in a big way like I did. Reminiscent of artists like Phillip Phillips, The Lumineers, Of Monsters and Men, and even Taylor Swift, these guys bring their formidable talents to the front on this collection. Their YouTube videos have been around for a few years now and certainly show their ability to cover other musicians' work. This will probably be on my 2013 Top 5 albums list along with Dawes, Gin Wigmore, and Shovels & Rope.
B004VFN72S|4.0|Sigourney Weaver is excellent and at the top of her game. Great thriller. Holly Hunter also gives a terrific performance.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved it!  Exquisitely written, suspenseful, emotional and a new, complete universe.  The characters are so carefully and consistently written, it's no wonder these books have been such a huge success.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Great flick. Well done with good story line. Takes you on a frightful journey from the moment the movie starts.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very addicting. you will spend hours plaint this game.  would like to send gifts more often and also help neighbors clear their land....rated 5big fat stars!!!!! awesome game.
B002LANLDK|5.0|love love love love it fast and held our attention the entire movie and there is never a dull moment love it would watch again it would be nice if they cost less to rent that would help
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's where you can put your ideas out for your own world. It is like building your own country and running it the way you want it ran.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|wonderful and great fast paced keeps you entertained the whole time loved it would watch it again and again and again
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If you're a Jack Reacher fan, you should watch this. It's a great watch even with 5'7\\" Tom Cruise as Reacher. Cruise did a good job not highlighting height or devaluing Reacher's character because of his own size. Fun movie. I haven't read this particular Lee Child book but I've read a half dozen others and the storyline seems mostly true to the Reacher character.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book is as fun as the others.  It wraps up some story lines from past novels and opens a couple more.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|What a great movie! Not for the storyline (which is a little sub-par) you should see this only because at some point in the 80's you said \\"wouldn't it be awesome if Sylvester Stalone and Arnold Schwarzeneger duked it out?\\" We'll, they don't duke it out but are on the same side blowing things up and killing bad guys. And when Schwarzeneger says \\"yippee kayay\\" to Bruce Willis after Willis says \\"no, I'll be back\\", well, it's just icing on the cake for you movie buffs. Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I have no comment this was not even worth getting, i deleted it right away. Do not waste your time
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a quick read with some real twists and turns.  The ending was excellent and it left me looking for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This first book was sexy hot.  It was the 2nd time I read it.  When people first start reading it, their first thought is &#34;who wants to read about this stuff&#34;, but what they don't know is by the 2nd book then the 3rd book it turns into a beautiful love story.  It dispels the song &#34;what's love got to do with it&#34;, PLENTY.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Love being able to continue playing it away from home and its easy to use, great graphics, just like the pc edition
B006R4H5FG|3.0|Gives you a whole new way of looking at Power Point presentations! I am using a lot of what he teaches already!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it was great. My boyfriend and I watched it together and we both liked it. It is action packed and full of witty lines. The witches makeup and graphics are very cool.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This is not a game. It is the tutorial to the game and it went soooooooooo slowly.  I felt like pulling my hair out.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Beautifully written with humour, compassion and skill. I loved this book. It is a great weekend or holiday read. Don't miss it.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Wow! I love the variety and range of her music. From her ballads to her in your face lyrics, she sings truthfully about love and life.<br />I'm ordering two more of her CDs now!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|LOVE This APP!  To be able to set this on countries that I have visited during career in the NAVY is very cool. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!&#34;
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I attended the Bethel Woods, NY concert Ringo did earlier on this tour.  It was the same set list and line-up (except for Joe Walshs' appearance).  The band is spot on. The choice of songs and pacing keep things moving right along. It was a great show. This DVD captures it perfectly. All of the performances are worth seeing, no real let downs. Everyone is top vocal and musical shape.  Ringo has put together his best all star show to date.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|challenging game, would reccommend to my friends, its easy in the beginning but then becomes harder. love it... need more.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie is a huge disservice to the die hard series. The name sorta spells out the whole movie. Please let this series die in peace.  Bigger explosions do not cover up this dismal failure of a film.
B008QI6EHQ|2.0|Definitely a great book to read if one wants to understand the early years of Hitler as a child and the circumstances in which he developed to become the Third Reich. The book is complex and hard to read because the translation.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|A sound film, with a new concept.  This film bangs away on all of the cylinders. A must see for any psychology buffs. And the effects are incredible!  Never send a shallow, stupid critic to do an educated viewer's job.  I almost passed this one over.  You definitely should not!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is addicting. I use it to pass the time away. My 6 year old loves it and it has inspired her to play with real cards at home.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was such a great movie! I loved how every possible gamut was covered... And how each story was told individually amongst the group! It was funny and sad and I think pretty realistic too!! I honestly don't know why I waited so long to see it!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This may not be his best  album but it is at Kanye West album even when he is experimenting.  There are countless reviews analyzing his album so I will add he never goes hard all the way on a song.  For instance, in New Slaves the beat starts off hard and his rhymes are poetic and protesting and when he his practically screaming his anger and disgust at you the beat changes to something that sounds like it belongs to a sitcom opening credits a la Crosby Show.  Skinhead does the same.  He goes hard then he gets a bit soft like &#34;just kidding, I'm not trying to depress or cause a revolution just wanted to educate&#34;.  Now that to me is a Kanye album.  He is always trying to educate people to his way of thinking.
B002K99P7S|4.0|A better than average superhero movie, with great set pieces, and good use of Marvel Comics history to create a strong back story.  Jackman and Schreiber are excellent  Good use of period setting.  Overall, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is similar to, but not quite as great, as X-Men: First Class, (which is one of my favorite superhero movies.)  Recommended for superhero fans and strongly recommended for Wolverine fans.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used Evernote for many years to remember everything from airline reservations to window sizes to web pages and product details. It's ability to sync between my phone and desktop computer ensures I have my needed data no matter where I am or how I found it. I haven't needed to upgrade to the paid version either.  The price is right for a very useful and polished app.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had no idea how much I would enjoy this short read book.  Fascinating information on a fascinating inventor and visionary .
B005DJRD80|5.0|For adults, this was a fun series to watch.  I usually watch science fiction shows, but this was a good change for me.  Loved it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My son, who is a preteen, does not like to read and I bought this at his teachers suggestion. Great buy, because I did not even have to prod him to pick up the book and read. Definitely recommend !
B00CB3QTR2|5.0|Love it. The effects are awesome, wonder if there will be a third? It would<br /> Be cool to see Bruce lee portrayed as a young'n
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The author seems to cover too much detail With many unnecessary characters. The plot moves at a snails pace in the middle 50 chapters. The end of the book has more dead people are not dead. there is nothing about the real threats to the realm (the others) but winter is coming (it's already buried main characters in snow so I think winter is here eh)?
B008BM9L72|3.0|This was a such a great read.  I couldn't put the book down.  It left me wanting more. Can't wait to watch the movie!
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Wonderful CD- new song but sounds like vintage EAGLES! I loved it and ordered a copy for a friend who loves the Eagles also.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this type of game, but they need way more levels...these are easy enough to burn through pretty quickly.
161655164X|5.0|Its everything i was hoping for and then some. A must buy for any fan of The Last Of Us.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show!  The acting and storylines are great.  The filming is beautiful and the script amazing.  5 STAR.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Well acted. I definitely will recommend to my friends. She is a great actress...so is Mariah.  I hope she makes a movie again.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I am a &#34;watch guy&#34; and a fan of automatic dive watches.  I have owned an Omega Seamaster as well as a Seiko Monster.  For the price this is an AMAZING value!  I like big watches and need something with &#34;presence&#34; on the wrist - the Grand Diver delivers - a huge watch but after a while ou get used to the size and it just feels right.  I have the older model with the Miyota movement - keep fantastic time - up to COSC standards better than my Seiko and as good as my Omega when it was new.  The bracelet is fantastic - double safety latch and the thick stainless hinge is an amazing touch for a watch of this price. The blue face looks black, purple or blue depending upon the ambient light of the room - very attractive. After spending $1700 on my Omega it required service after about 6 years - would have cost several hundred dollars so I sold it - at $110 the Grand Diver looks better (IMHO), keeps as good time, has great water resistance and if it dies in a few years certainly cheap enough to get another ( although I have heard the Miyota and Seiko movements in these are bullet proof and long lasting). The only negative and a very slight one is that the bezel is a little looser than I would like - ratchets one way as it should but not as tight as my Seiko - certainly not terrible.  In fact I have been wearing the Grand Diver just about every day and gave the Seiko Monster to my son for his18th birthday.  I don't really understand the deep discounting Invicta pricing system but feel this watch is worth what they have listed as retail - seriously thinking of getting another to keep stashed in case this model is discontinued!
B00BF11STU|4.0|This movie is not an action adventure, rather it is a sad commentary on the bureaucracy prevalent in the USDA today. A mentality of cover your ass. The courage of some to overcome the BS is well showcased. By all means a good movie that highlights the few and the brave who act on their convictions. I would recommend with the caveat of don't expect and action adventure flick.
0451228375|5.0|This is a sequel to Pillars of the Earth.<br />I loved them both.<br />Don't be taken back by the thickness of these books.<br />They're both a great read!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Very long and kinda boring don't get me wrong Lincoln was a great man but the movie was long and good acting!!!!!!!
0312323867|3.0|If I could give this book 2.5 stars I probably would but settled on 3 to round up.<br /><br />I had read the first book of this series and loved it so I figured I would love this book just as much. To be fair I read something borrowed ages ago so maybe my taste has just changed but I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would.<br /><br />I had read that it got better after the first 100 pages or so and I will agree that it did improve but I never fully understood Darcy's character in this book.<br /><br />I also felt like this book switched between two speeds either painfully slow and warp speed. One minute it takes you 30 pages to read about the day to day activities of Darcy's life at that part of the story then the next minute you'll read 3-4 story altering details or events within 3 pages. A bit annoying. For this reason the book seemed very boring even though a lot happened because in 75% of the book nothing was going on, the action or big things happened on the other 25% of the pages. Could just be me, I am not sure if others felt this way but it is just my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thank you so much for making this game available for Kindle users. I am very addicted to this game thank you for allowing me to play it on a larger screen, I was getting frustrated with playing it on my smartphone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't believe they killed off Matthew!  He was my favorite character and I have difficulty envisioning the series without him.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A continuation of the saga with typical intrigue and detailed history lessons, travelogue and surprises.  Dan Brown is unsurpassed with the word pictures ---- and DETAILS.  If you want a light, jump- in- anywhere story, forget it.  You truly can't put it down.  Be prepared to get nothing else accomplished til you've finished it!
B0091X2K0A|5.0|This is the best \\"war movie\\" maybe even the best \\"movie\\" of all time!! The opening scene; bootcamp scene was the best part of the movie.
B00DM12ANO|5.0|It's a movie about a girl and boy how their love changed everything. I concept of the movie was very original and is so Beautifully done. The movie is simply amazing Visually. It Definitely a movie worth seeing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series...I am hooked and anxiously awaiting next season!  Love that I can stream it through Amazon Prime and with no commercial!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy reading and entertaining. The perfect poolside book that draws you in from distractions! Leaves the reader wanting to finish the series...
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Played this game for over an hour. I couldn't put it down. There are so many levels to master. You have to get this game. It is well writen and the graphics are great. No issues running on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Whatever you do play this game. It is as fun as it is addictive. Candy crush it is not, but you'll grow to love it. Prince.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think the game is fun and addicting especially if you love minions like me. It is more fun than subway surf and cool
B00992CF6W|5.0|Both my grandchildren have spent hours playing this.  As an adult i haven't quite figured it out, ha ha,  but they are a wiz on it.
B001AQQR2S|3.0|When I saw this when it came out, it annoyed me how different it was from the book in worse ways, and ways unnecessary for good movie adaptation.  When I saw this as an adult with my daughter, I felt the same.  I would give it one star.<br /><br />However, I will compromise it as a 3 star review because when I watched it with my 4 year old right after finishing reading the book, she loved it.
B00BJDARGO|5.0|I collect concert DVD's & this one really has that live sound. Turn it up & you will think you are there!
0142424277|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book to myself when I was 6 so I read it to my 4 year old.  She loved it.  She is constantly comparing herself to Matilda now.  Great book
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Redone in beautiful color.  Forgot how great this movie is!!  Its really is one of Hitchcock's best - kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I am so glad that this app works on my kindle fire HD because I don't have a phone yet and this works perfectly for all those people that have kindle fire HD's<br />Nice work kik!!!&lt;3
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really great game that makes you think. Best $2 I've spent in awhile. Lots of puzzles and challenges. The music kinda creeps you out too... which I liked!! Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained!! Can't wait for more to come!! Please hurry!!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|What else could you ask for. It's the greatest thing known to man. You already knew its a cole world
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A plot that never fails to interest and is full of surprises.  The characters are exceptionally well drawn.  Wish actors wouldn't keep quitting.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Classic Bruce Willis with the twist of a equally stubborn son.<br />Great action and shoot em up sequences one would expect from the Die Hard series.
B0010T75W6|5.0|I have to say, the story line of this movie is absolutely amazing, if you can get past the in-your-face brashness. I must admit, the tone of the movie really does add to, rather than distract from, the story that is being told, and I can't imagine telling the story any other way. Definetly a must watch....
B008QJNXEC|4.0|This is a good movie to watch with a group of stoners. Really wacked out. Depp does a great job playing eccentric and strange characters he is perfect for this one.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|The movie was very good and I may watch it again. The music is very good but when compared to the first one it does lack a bit.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slender man game ever but if you are lucky if you play on easy with fog and that Crap off, b4 you get a page look at the edge of the map! Sometimes slender is standing there &quot;walking&quot; but not moving! It looks like he is moon walking! XD
