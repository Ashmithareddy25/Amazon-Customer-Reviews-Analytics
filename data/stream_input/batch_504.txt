B0009NZ3BO|1.0|I have written to the On Reflection email list as well as DRT Entertainment about this problem as well.  Its unratable as it is because it is such a glaring mistake. Perhaps this issue will be worth something someday. It  is interesting in that you can hear the parts that are evident with a deconstructionust ear,(like the Scraping the Barrel box set which is amazing!). But I really want to hear this album in particular mastered correctly.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Just a few quick comments to try to help as other objective reviews helped me. I've been a Soundgarden/Rage fan from the beginning of both of those bands but I'm not a blind follower. The 'Cochise' single disappointed me when I first heard it, but months later I gave that album a chance and found songs like 'Gasoline' and 'Light my way' quenched my hard rock thirst. That album also had some mellow, melodic tracks to bring the total number of good songs high enough to make a buy worth it. You need at least 3 or 4 good songs, right?  <br /> <br />'Out of Exile' passes the 'enough good songs to buy test. The band has progressed with more sonic depth to the songs, some great solos from Morello (many songs have them on this album), and more creativity. I'll just cut to the chase and tell you good and bad: <br /> <br />Best songs: <br />1. You're time has come  - production on this track makes it tamer than it should be, but still good. <br />2. Out of Exile - good hard rock song. very catchy, good riff, good lyrics.  <br />3. Be Yourself - you've heard this moving, expressive rock song on the radio. Good stuff.  <br />7. The Worm - this is not typical audioslave. it's more like old school soundgarden. it oozes grunge with an old zeppelin feel. makes you want to snarl and bob your head along with it. i miss rock like this. <br />11. #1 Zero - mellow, bluesy track you wouldn't expect from audioslave. it has some Morello magic on it that will blow you away by the end. plus it's one of those songs that seduces you with dark blues, then kicks your butt with a wall of guitar at the end.  <br /> <br />5 great songs that make this worth it.  <br /> <br />As for the others, they just don't do it for me. The second single on the radio now, 'Doesn't Remind Me', totally bites. I have no clue why they picked it. It's a boring strum from E to A, then E then A that keeps repeating and sounds out of place. It just doesn't sound right. Makes me think of Pearl Jam Vs. 'Spin the black circle', when the main guitar lick/chorus kicks in and sounds so damn happy when it should be edgier or darker. Couple other clunkers on this audioslave album, a few of which are just ok, but that's it. Hope this helps.
B0002RNXNM|3.0|Having heard the song 'Club Foot' on a dance radio station I decided I would get the debut album that is itself self titled. Kasabian is a new Brittish band that takes a bit of the sounds from all genres and meshes them together. It is part of a new wave of new artists who are trying to progress new genres that are infact segments of different music genres mixed together. Many say this is the continued evolution of music sound and that new genres and sub genres daily are born by inventive music minds. I did not enjoy this album that I felt did not evolve the different sounds together. Some songs like I.D sounded to hoarse and rough to listen too. Maybe towards the end 3 songs did the band get more of a feel of the music they were trying to synthesise because the songs 'Cutt Off' and 'Butcher Blues' sounded good. Not entirely a bad effort by this new band who sound like mini Oasis mixed with the Sex Pistols.
B000002H2H|4.0|Forget Slayer, Metallica is the sound of thrash, and this album proves it.  Though not as musically interesting (in my humble opinion) as ...And Justice For All, Ride The Lightning is definitely heavier. <br /> <br />\\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is absolutely crushing, a strong point from which to begin the album. <br /> <br />On the title track, Hetfield's vocals sound different from any that I've ever heard from him on any of Metallica's other releases.  He releases the desperation of a man about to be executed flawlessly, making this one of the best tracks on the album. <br /> <br />\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is, simply put, a Metallica classic.  If you have not heard this song, and you like what you've heard of Metallica's early years (if you have heard any), then purchase this now. <br /> <br />\\"Fade To Black\\" is their first ballad.  Hetfield reveals the fact that he can sing and not just shout on this track.  Some might see this as an indication of things to come, but it is still heavy and interesting enough not to fall within the sell-out category that Reload and Load might fall into. <br /> <br />\\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is not my favorite song.  It's fast, it's heavy, but it's not all that interesting. <br /> <br />\\"Escape\\" is almost too catchy for a metal song, but it is still definitely metal. <br /> <br />The opening riff on \\"Creeping Death\\" slowly introduces another of my favorites on this album with a great chorus about the Exodus from the point of view of the angel of death. <br /> <br />\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" is not my favorite instrumental by Metallica; it is a little too repetitive and boring in some parts.  If you can hold out until the end, though, it gets pretty cool. <br /> <br />This album shows why Metallica is synonymous with 80s metal.  It is my second favorite of theirs, topped only by Justice.  Buy both if you can.
037571457X|5.0|I just finished the book, Persepolis. It's a graphic novel that depicts the history of the islamic revolution of 1980 in Iran. Told from the point of view of a 12 through 14 year old girl (she ages through-out the story), Persepolis gave me a clear view of what happened in the area between Iraq, Iran, Egypt and Israel. First, there was a Shah put in power by the British government. In return for his power, the brits received oil rations from Iran. The shah became corrupt though and was overthrown by islamic revolutionaries who established a regime. Under this regime, women were required to wear veils and long black durkahs. I always thought of that as kind of normal, like, 'eh, it's not like it was that different before. It's not like they were wearing daisy dukes and tanktops.' Little did I know however that Iranians actually were very westernized before the regime change and it would be moderately equivalent to making Americans today wear veils and men wear long sleeve shirts with buttons. The long sleeves on men were meant so that the bare arms with hair on them didn't excite the women. Women who were somewhat reticent and stubborn though showed a little hair on their head in the front wear the veil goes up around the forehead. The girl in this book rejoices when she gets Iron Maiden and Kim Wilde posters for her room, some 1983 nike shoes, a denim jacket, and a Michael Jackson button to put on her jacket. She still has to wear the veil though with all the western clothing which looks kinda funny. This graphic novel took me about 3 hours total to read and was well worth it. I'm now more educated in the goings-on in the middle east and want to read the book, Countdown to Crisis---about Iran. I never knew how much of a difference there is between Arabs and Persians (Iranians). They conisder themselves completely different and superior to one another. And all hate Israel.
B000005HNQ|4.0|Anneke and Tarja from Nightwish are my two favorite female lead singers when it comes to this kind of music.  While with Nightwish, we have over-the-top sythesizers and powerful operatic voices, The Gathering are more laid-back, delivering a more subtle power through lead-vocalist Anneke. <br /> <br />Anneke is by far superior to the Evanescense singer.  It's difficult for me to compare the two, as I see them as from two completely separate genres.  The Gathering sounds more gothic and less like Britney Spears trying to be gothic.  Evanescense is okay...they're better than Tapping the Vein, but that's not saying a whole lot.  This band is miles above the two: they started as a gothic band and slowly became more acceptable to a larger audience.  But the fact is that they appeal to BOTH the goth AND the pop crowds, and if that is not signs of a talented band, I don't know what is. <br /> <br />Only reason I rate it four stars is because I don't really like the more pop-sounding melodies they use, but that's more an issue of personal taste than a defect of the band. <br /> <br />Highlights for me include: \\"Nighttime Birds\\", \\"Confusion\\", and \\"Kevin's Telescope\\".
B000002UVX|4.0|This album contains some of the most inventive, jaw-dropping, other-wordly guitar playing you will hear. Read more of the other reviews about this, because I have a problem with this album that I wish to discuss: Buddy Miles' singing. I personally find it really annoying, and it takes away from the album as a whole. I guess scat singing really isn't my thing. Now don't let this stop you from buying the album, since the music is absolutely amazing (I do enjoy Miles' drumming very much, by the way) and Machine Gun in particular is just unbelievable. I just wanted to send out a warning about something that I wasn't expecting and something that not too many reviewers mention.
B000063DFN|4.0|Maiden never fails to impress with the maddeningly awesome riffs, the double guitar harmonies, and the brilliant solos.  However, I never really liked their choice in singers.  Dickinson is probably the best, but he sounds like he's straining a lot of the time.  A lot of the power metal bands that came later and tried to emulate him sing a lot smoother than he does. <br /> <br />But that's Maiden's only flaw on this album, and Dickinson is still good, just not my favorite metal singer.  Though I liked his latest solo album. <br /> <br />Harris is a composition god, and he proves that yet again on this album.  \\"Aces High\\" is an awe-inspiring opener.  \\"Two Minutes To Midnight\\" is good, but for some reason Dickinson irritates me more on this track than on the rest of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Losfer Words\\" is a great instrumental, right up there with \\"Genghis Khan\\".  \\"Flash of the Blade\\" has a great riff, and the bass line makes it sound so dark.  It could almost be a power metal anthem. <br /> <br />I'm not as impressed with \\"The Duellists\\" as some others might be...if Maiden had a filler on this album, this would be it.  It's not really a filler, though, but it lacks some of the energy than the other songs on Powerslave. <br /> <br />\\"Back In The Village\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" are good as well.  The Middle-Eastern feeling you can tell they are trying to create in \\"Powerslave\\" falls a little flat, but it's still a powerful song. <br /> <br />But what makes this album the best Maiden has offered is the song, \\"Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner\\".  This puts you right in the middle of Coleridge's epic poem, and songs like this are what inspired Helloween and the power metal bands after them.  This is a song no metal listener should miss.
B000065PUE|5.0|Looping rhythms, crazed singing, great melodies, and songs, intelligent and odd lyrics... quite simply one of the most perfect rock albums ever made. It's up there with Revolver by the Beatles or Who's Next. If you can own only one Pixies album this is the one to get baby. Name another band who's written a song (Debaser) about Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's movie Andalusian Dog. I dare you.
0743454537|5.0|I just finished this book today, yet I bought it yesterday. I was unable to put it down - the story was gripping, the characters were so realistic and I could not tear myself away.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone. The basis of the story alone will capture your attention, but the characters will capture your heart. Never has a book touched me so deeply as to make me cry, this one has.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|The funniest movie ever made.  If your feeling down, this movie will pick you right up.  Jon Heder is hilarious. Not only a must see, but a must own movie.  O yeah . . .  VOTE 4 PEDRO!!
B0000666DW|5.0|The album starts off with a clip of T-Rex from \\"Jurassic Park\\" screaming its prehistoric head off.  Perhaps no other sound would have done this album (or band) justice.  Their raw brutality and their innovation are a breath of fresh air in a largely stagnant music scene.  The sound is mighty and raw, but they aren't afraid to switch on a dime.  Take the second track, for instance, called \\"March of the Fire Ants\\".  The song is massive and swarming, but somewhere near the middle of it there's a melodic breakdown that pitches the song from brutality and into the realm of epic.  Mastodon is wise in that it employs that particular epic feel sparingly, so that it doesn't wear out and it is a sweet excursion every time.  And to think, they went on to do _Leviathan_ after this!  It can only get better from here... <br /> <br />Don't be suprised when you open your copy of _Remission_ and you find me lost somewhere in the convoluted folds of the song \\"Ol'e Nessie\\", unwilling to return home again.
B00079018K|5.0|All I can say the music is FAN F'ING TASTIC. Get your hands on every last track. JUST DONT BUY THE CD. Dont give the record company scum bags the satisfaction. I know they still get a cut of the mp3's but they're not controlling what you can do with them. Support the band anyway you can, see them live, by thir merchandise and buy their music. Just dont buy the CD. <br /> <br />It has all been said here about the music. Quite possibly the best stuff I've heard in a lon long time. I got my wife and all my friends into this band. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger is talking about this band. If you go to TheArnoldfans.com is states there that he works out to Club Foot.  <br /> <br />Welcome to the world Kasabian. We wate with open arms.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Imagine having to walk around the city you live in with your skull popped open and your brain exposed.  Now that you're imagining that, you can begin to invoke the panic and frenzy that is _Jane Doe_.  From the first nerve shredding song to the final heart pounding epic moments of the title track, this record seethes with energy.  By the time the song \\"Bitter and Then Some\\" ends, you'll be out of breath and the pillars of the earth will be shaking, but you won't be able to turn it off.  The greasy groove of \\"Hell To Pay\\" burns like an old house blazing on a nighttime farm with someone's family still inside.  \\"Phoenix in Flight\\" evokes the kind of introspection one can only achieve doused in gasoline and holding a lit match.  Alternately, there's nothing introspective at all about the adjoining track \\"Phoenix in Flames\\", with its string your guitar with your hamstrings and strum with a razorblade rawness.  This album is either a symbol of the future of heavy music, or an omen of the endtimes.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I have to say that when Pulp Fiction came out, people made a big deal about it.  I had not seen Resevoir Dogs, so I didn't know about the wunderkind Tarantino. So given all that has gone before - what about this movie?  In a few words - its violent, disgusting(eyeball anyone?), visually arresting, a virtual cornocopia of movie genre styles, and about one of the most consistently interesting movies I think I have seen, perhaps ever.  It is just so memorable.<br /><br />Why?  Kill Bill is a female empowerment, martial arts, revenge B movie, western.  It makes no sense, takes place in a dream world and yet is great.  What can I say.<br /><br />Uma Thurman is excellent in this movie.  She nails every emotion in the book, but David Carradine is phenomenal.  His charecterization of Bill - the person that the first movie and this one leads to finding and having revenge against - is soo good at being both evil and damn interesting that to say he eats the scenery is an understatment.  Wow. Darryl Hannah and Michael Madsen also give great performances as two more people 'The Bride' seeks revenge against.<br /><br />The movie is not one big blood fest as I originally thought and heard.  To me it is more like a kid's idea of gore.  It is disgusting, but the horror is more often the product of your mind's imagination.  Yet, there is gore to be sure.<br /><br />Tarantino is one of the few directors in today's Hollywood with a great sense of visual style.<br /><br />Kill Bill is truly a unique film.  If your not a fim buff, many things may not make sense.  The training with Pai Mei seems to border on the ridiculous, yet in the context of the martial arts movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon, and others, it seems to fit.  The Five Palm Exploding Heart is stupid, and yet seems at all possible.  The charecters don't seem to exixt in the real world - who cares?<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie - memorable and interesting and truly a product of a sick mind.  However, as Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World), a sick mind is a perpetual feast.<br /><br />Ready to eat?k mind.

B0009KA7BS|5.0|I found Constantine to be thrilling, dark, passionate and just an all around entertaining film. I noticed in the reviews that as per usual with Mr. Reeves the women like him and the men hate him. Personally I have found that a guy's opinion of him is directly linked to whether or not their wife and or girlfriend likes him. Guys, guys get over it! The film is great!!!
0684803356|5.0|\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" has long been my favorite Ernest Hemingway novel. A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\\" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history.<br /><br />Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.)<br /><br />The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.<br /><br />During the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer.<br /><br />Robert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, \\"a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record.\\" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the \\"show\\" and provide the most effective opposition.<br /><br />Pablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place.<br /><br />Pilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with \\"El Sordo,\\" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war.<br /><br />Mar&iacute;a's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, \\"Viva my husband, the town's mayor,\\" before she died, rather than the more typical, \\"Viva La Republica!\\" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway.<br /><br />A thrilling subplot is developed when Andr&eacute;s, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment.<br /><br />A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.<br /><br />Again, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate \\"tu\\" form  into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans.<br /><br />This is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.<br />JANA, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves.

0064407667|5.0|Kid's books are great. They always make me go back to when every story was different, every thing was new, and I wanted to be like all those heroic characters that peopled those wonderful tales. Lemony Snicket's \\"Series of unfortunate events\\" was released as an instant classic, and I always wanted to find out why. Now, after reading the first book in the series, I know.<br /><br />First of all, there are no impossible feats attributed to the three young Beaudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny. They are as common and down-to-earth as I was when I was their age. There are also no magic tricks, no nice fairies and no advanced technology to help them in their unfortunate lives after their parents die in a fire that consumed their mansion. Not that tales with magic, fairies, goblins and ultra-modern stuff aren't great - we have Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, just to name the most known examples, and they are also great - but this time the author chose to show to his young readers that even the most simple characters can have great adventures.<br /><br />Written in a simple but eloquent manner - where the narrator talks directly to you, like a teacher -, with a sarcastic and a little dark vein, \\"A bad beginning\\" shows the radical change in the lives of the Beaudelaire orphans as they have to live with the despicable Count Olaf, a man whose sole interest is to grab the orphans' fortune, and will conceive the most mirabolant plans to achieve his objective.<br /><br />The story is very simple, and the book is very short, but I think that as an introduction to a series of more than ten books, it is perfect. Perfect to grab the interest of its readers - not only the young ones, but also the older ones (myself included) -, perfect to make every reader wonder if there will not be really a single happy ending to the Beaudelaires.<br /><br />I'm hooked, and I expect the series will get better with each new story.<br /><br />Grade 8.6/10
B0009A21R6|5.0|I've waited a long time for this album to be available on SACD. The wait was definitely worth it. This is reference quality audio that beats any vinyl in my collection.<BR>I dare you to listen to Money for Nothing and not get chills.

1573223026|5.0|Nick Hornby's new book is all-good. Perhaps one of the funniest authors on the planet, this new book isn't all about laughs. It's about people trying to figure it all out. It's answering the big questions: why are we here? Why do bad things happen? Should we just do ourselves in when it's all turned to crap? Not that there aren't funny parts. Because there are. He has a gift for creating funny scenes. For giving us real, fantastically detailed characters. Characters are what move Hornby's books, not plot devices.<br /><br />A Long Way Down rambles sometimes. It meanders along and you wonder how it will resolve itself and then it just does. But I was happy when I put it down. Not happy that it was over but happy that I had taken a walk with these four characters. His narration of each of them is spot on to their personalities. Each one of them, in many ways, tries to explain to you why they have got it figured out but in the end it's whatever you yourself have taken from the book that is the point.<br /><br />I won't say that because it's about four people thinking about committing suicide that it should be required reading for anyone who has thought about suicide. I'm sure there are more thought provoking, life saving books. I will say that it should be required reading for people who are Nick Hornby fans and for anyone who has ever thought, \\"What's the point of this s#$t!\\" And who hasn't thought that, huh?
B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails came back after a long five year wait form their last double CD the Fragile with a CD quite unexpected sound. This CD has a unique sound to it like all NIN CDs, but what Trent especially changed up on this was no electronic beats so he got the one and only Dave Grohl to be the drummer for this CD, but if I compared it to the rest this is more like Pretty Hate Machine, now anyway. This CD opens wonderfully with \\"All the Love in the World\\" which starts out very slow but by the end of the CD you'll end up jamming out. The other tracks that standout to me are for one the current single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" which you have all heard so no reason to explain it. \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" has great stringed parts to it, a bit of a slow song. \\"With Teeth\\" the self-titled track that is one of the heavier songs on the CD. \\"Only\\" my personal favorite is probably the most upbeat song which is one of those songs that will just get you moving and stuck in your head. To wrap this up this is the most accessible, listenable, to NIN CD out of them all I could listen to the whole thing without skipping a single track.
B00005JNJT|4.0|There's a long sequence near the beginning of BATMAN BEGINS where Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) finds himself in Bhutan being groomed to join the League of Shadows, an organization headed by the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe) and dedicated to ....doing something with power and fear. This part of the story contains the requisite mumbo-jumbo about anger, power, control, etc. that's pro forma in this type of film, most of it smoothly delivered by Liam Neeson as Ra's sidekick.  <br /> <br />A central theme that emerges amid all the talk is the lengths to which Bruce is willing to go to avenge his parents, who we see murdered in an early flashback. The Gotham part of the film, done in a neo-realist style, involves Bruce's first stabs at being Batman, corporate intrigue at Wayne Enterprises, possible love with a childhood sweetheart turned DA (Katie Holmes) and an insufficiently imagined villain called the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) who plans to destroy Gotham with the use of panic inducing drugs.  <br /> <br />This is a genuinely new take on the superhero flick, which never loses sight of the fact that Bruce is just a man, with no superpowers....the first rate cast includes Michael Caine (Oscar-worthy as Alfred), Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Linus Roache, Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman as Bruce's gadget guy.....the best film of the summer...
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I've never bought a Metallica disc but I found this documentary fascinating. It nicely illustrates what happens when bands stay together too long and have the money to try to keep things going. (For example, after recording the new album with the bass played by the album's producer, a new awe-struck bassist is recruited and almost casually offered $1 million up front to commit to the band. Another example: the ageing live-in psychotherapist that the band decides to get rid of is revealed at around Day 600 to be charging his services at nearly half a million a year.)<br /><br />Not knowing much about Metallica, I can't decide how bright the guys are. In discussion in the movie, they often spoke eloquently about themselves and the problems of working together. (Maybe this was just the result of being surrounded by Californian psycho-babble all their lives.) But then when they're trying to come up with lyrics to their tunes, they all seem to write entirely in uppercase, which is normally used to hide poor punctuation.<br /><br />The lyric-writing scenes were revealing, making it abundantly clear that the band records the riff and the music first. They then sit around on sofas listening to the music track, and sketch out their ideas on notepads. One or two of them just doodle, much to the frustration of the others. (That was a wonderfully funny scene, introduing an angle that neither Spinal Tap nor Bad News had thought of.)<br /><br />My favourite scenes are the ones involving Lars's Dad, a Gandalf figure with a long white beard and a walking stick but a penchant for yoga and a good knowledge of 1970s rock music. The psychotherapist gets Lars to talk about his Dad in a field -- while his Dad is hunched over his stick and doing knee-stretching exercises. Everyone wants their Dad to be impressed by their achievements, but maybe you shouldn't ask your Dad's opinion on the heavy metal tracks you've been laying down. Lars really has to bite his lip as his Dad struggles not to tell him that he really thought the track was rubbish.<br /><br />Although Metallica might be Lars's band, it is nothing without James. When he goes off for six months' rehab, all the other two members can do is sit around and dredge up old mates. when he then returns and demands that the band only work for four hours a day -- without even being able to listen to tracks outside those hours -- Lars flips, and expresses his dislike for the arrangement in the best speech of the film.<br /><br />Though you see much, there's a lot you don't see. Despite the Napster lawsuit going on at the time, you don't see any discussions with Metallica's attorneys, for example.<br /><br />I have to say that, despite all the hilarity, the band-rebuilding process actually seems to work. The track excerpts we hear sound decent. Maybe some of the other middle-aged bands I follow should take note.not to tell him that he really thought the track was rubbish. <br /> <br />Although Metallica might be Lars's band, it is nothing without James.

B0002S947K|4.0|The best songs on Trouble, the debut release from songwriter Ray LaMontagne, draw on deep wells of emotion, and with LaMontagne's sandpapery voice, which recalls a gruffer, more sedate version of Tim Buckley or an American version of Van Morrison, they seem to belie his years. The title tune, \\"Trouble,\\" is an instant classic, sparse and maudlin (in the best sense), and songs like \\"Narrow Escape,\\" a ragged, episodic waltz, are equally impressive, with careful, cinematic lyrics that tell believable stories of wounded-hearted refugees on the hard road of life and love. Most of the tracks fall into a midtempo shuffle rhythm, so the words have to carry a lot in order to avert a sort of dull sameness, and when it works, it works big, and when it doesn't, well, LaMontagne is so serious and sincere about his craft that you tend to forgive him instantly. Sara Watkins of Nickel Creek guests on \\"Hannah\\" and the sad, somber lullaby \\"All the Wild Horses,\\" playing fiddle and adding vocals, and producer Ethan Johns adds drums and other touches on most tracks. The sound is measured and sparse, with few frills (a five-piece string section is used on a few tracks, but is never intrusive), all of which supports the emotional urgency of LaMontagne's writing. \\"How Come\\" sounds a bit like a rewrite of Dave Mason's \\"Feelin' Alright,\\" and a couple of other cuts seem a bit labored, but overall this is an impressive debut by an extremely special songwriter.
B000001ELP|4.0|If Queen would have recorded this musical like fairy tale everybody would have loved it but most people dont want Kiss to explore new territory and \\"The Elder\\" proofs it.  <br /> <br />If you listen to the concept album solely and forget about the other Kiss albums around then it becomes obvious that this is cool stuff and even though it is not the best album Kiss ever produced I think that the majority of fans and critics are way to negative about it.  <br /> <br />\\"Dark Light\\" is the worst song on the album but thats because Ace really cant sing but songs like \\"Just a boy\\", \\"Only you\\" and of course \\"World without heroes\\" should be among the Kiss classics.
B000001YOW|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  Some of their best work is on this record, including Sever, Waiting Phase One, Every Home is Wired and Dark Matter.  The non-lyrical tracks carry the mood of the album, which I believe to be a somber, darker feeling.  I strongly suggest this album for the beginners to Porcupine Tree; it seems to be one of the more popular albums for new listeners.  Any Porcupine Tree hardcores already own this album and, more than likely, know most of the details contained on the disc.  I suggest picking up the digipack edition only because the sound quality is so much better.  Bottom line, buy the album.  You will be proud to boast that you knew of Porcupine Tree before the rest of America did.
B000002A46|5.0|I love this CD of Mariah Carey. Mariah is one of my all-time favorite singers. Sge takkes Christmas songs and makes the beautiful. Great Job Mariah for this amazing album.
B000005HFH|5.0|A beautiful and haunting collection from a wonderful talent. His melancholy vocals can convey the most painful emotions, but Look for the Silver Lining shows a different side to Baker, a hopeful and optimistic side.<br /><br />Each song is truly unique, showcasing not only Baker's vocals, but his trademark trumpet solos. This album must be in every cd collection, this is how music should be.
B0002S65W2|1.0|A dreary and uninspired entry into the \\"Psychological Third Act Twist Thriller\\" genre, this one was only saved from distribution by Nu-Image or Troma by the presence of Halle Berry, who may have the worst taste in projects of any actress ever known. How she can go from getting an Oscar to becoming Catwoman is beyond me. In this movie, Halle clearly has her head in somebody's else's Asylum. Gothika is a colossal train wreck, a movie about a haunted asylum where absolutely nothing happens.<br /><br />Joel Silver and his Dark Castle label may be the single worst thing to happen to horror movies in the history of cinema. Hard to believe that somehow they keep making these monstrosities. I won't even go into how bad Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions were. What happened to the Joel Silver who made Predator, and who is this charlatan who took his place? Now he gives us House of Wax starring Paris Hilton. Oh joy.
B000059TEQ|5.0|I'm surprised that tagline has not been used for the other people's reviews on here - though slightly cheesy and predictable, it does have everything to do with this film's incredible power and poignancy. <br /> <br />Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal were virtual nobodies before they played love-struck students Jenny and Oliver in this college movie set around Harvard and Radcliffe. Being a Boston student myself I can tell you one of the most amazing things about this movie is the shooting around this incredible city. <br /> <br />However, there's a lot more to \\"Love Story\\" than setting - the story is basically yet another modern day Romeo and Juliet - though not exactly, by any means. It's refreshingly simple and touching - and was such a major hit in 1970 (so says my mother) that it attracted around-the-block lines for weeks on end. <br /> <br />The catchphrase, Love means never having to say you're sorry, came 13th in a recent AFI list of top movie quotes of all time - and really, it does catch the essence of this great love movie. These two souls really do understand one another, and if we take nothing else away from this film, it is the understanding of that love, and how it relates to all other loves we have ever had. You really FEEL their love - because of the film's simplicity and captivating flirtatious manner of acting. <br /> <br />Don't miss out on Love Story - it's beautiful and it will stay with you for a long time.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is an excellent album. Coldplay gets serious on \\"X&Y.\\" Everything is outstanding. The lyrics are simple, but it amounts to something epic with combined with the music. Coldplay is in true form. They make good music look effortless.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Mary Poppins - what a GLORIOUS and somewhat overlooked musical! I used to be a fan of the movie when I was little, but this is one of the few movies that, when revisited as an adult, is just as entertaining! <br /> <br />I saw Mary Poppins in a whole new light - things that I had missed as a little girl were all too clear to me now - Mary Poppins is more than a pretty face - she comes into the Banks family, a couple who are somewhat distracted from their two beautiful children Jane and Michael as they both pursue independent goals in 1910 London - and she makes the family remember how special family really is. <br /> <br />Along the way, however, there is nothing but fun. It's hard to BELIEVE just how many brilliant songs and dances can be crammed into a movie and how much color and magic can be woven in there. Highlights are the animated Jolly Holiday sequence, Mary Poppins' tidy-up-the-nursery game \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\", and the touching song (the favorite of Walt Disney himself) \\"Feed the Birds\\". <br /> <br />A cast of all-rounded perfection completes this classic tale - such a shame that I learned the little boy who played Michael died about a decade after the movie was made! Such a cutie, what a loss... <br /> <br />This DVD was definitely not disappointing - it's always nice to have a classic childhood memory come alive in top quality again on DVD - but the special features were more than generous, including a talk with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke about the project, and a making-of documentary with a lot of info for any movie buffs. <br /> <br />At the beginning of this review I called this a musical - and indeed it is - a wonderful treasure that exceeds most typically \\"for children\\" films. This movie is for everyone - and has many lessons to be learned. The film that made Julie Andrews a star, this movie is worthy of the title \\"musical\\" even in the most serious of terms.
0807219533|5.0|Don't believe anyone who says this is a Harry Potter knock-off. The hero, if there is one, in this story is probably the demon. And he has the best line in sarcasm I've heard in a long time. Unlike Harry Potter, the human 'hero' or center of the story is very unlikeable about half the time, but Jonathan Stroud has written his character so well that I'm really interested to see how he will turn out in the third book. Will Nathaniel redeem himself, or will he turn into the magician that he hated in this book? There's also a great female character in the second book who is smart and competent without teetering on the edge of Mary-Sueness like Hermione tends to.   For all those who love this book, you absolutely must listen to the recorded version. Simon Jones does a terrific job, particularly with Bartimaeus' mouthy snark. I've listened to it at least three times, but then I love to reread books.
6302842557|5.0|I have seen very few operas, but this still remains one my very favorite films.  It's wonderfully done in every way.  From sets, to costumes, to characters, to the story, to the perfomances, everything about this film is high, high quality.<br /><br />I really like how the narration is done from the antagonist's point of view, and speaking of the antagonist, I've never seen anyone do a better acting job.  It was as if you could see exactly what he was thinking the whole time.  Let's see Paris Hilton do that.<br /><br />The focus of this film isn't really on Mozart.  It's on a contemporary of his that no one knows about.  It's really a great story.  A must-see.
B0000844IT|5.0|This is quintessential Bruce Campbell, the most under-rated actor of our time. This is a man's mans  movie. A movie that can be quoted over and over again. Also check out Bubba Hotep!
6305127638|3.0|I have to agree with another review I saw here.  This is the best of the Star Trek films.  Still, there are a whole bunch of episodes in the series better than this film.  All Good Things, Tapestry, Q Who, Family, Chain of Command Part 2, Future Imperfect, Elementary Dear Data, The Chase, Who Watches the Watchers, all of these episodes are better than any of the films.  The film is still okay, but it just can't top some of the episodes in the series.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I've listened to this album about 15 times, but I find very little exciting material here. <br />It is certainly more diverse than Train of Thought, which I think is a good thing. But for the rest, most of the songs just sound like typical Dream Theater, only less inspired, less enthusiastic and simpler than on their previous albums. <br />I know Dream Theater can do much better than this. It sounds like they need to refind their inspiration and energy. <br />Compared to their other albums, this album is definitely the most boring.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I was excited about this movie at first.  The previews showed great special effects, and of course, you know the story is going to be good.  It's from the Time Machine book after all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when you go to see it, something's just not right.  For the first 30 minutes or so the film seems good, and then it just loses its magic.  I guess in the film the future doesn't seem so future-esque.  It doesn't paint a picture of being FAR out into the future like the book does.  It almost feels like one of the actors could just walk off the set at any moment, and if the camera follows him you'll see New York City in the background.<br /><br />At this point the film seems mediocre, but unfortunately it doesn't stay that way.  When it gets to the end, the hero meets this really cool evil guy in a dark cavern.  They get all philosophical and stuff, and it's neat for a while.  And then all of a sudden the film starts to fall apart completely.  At this point, the presence of the evil guy shows the film has already deviated from the book, so who knows what will happen.  Unfortunately, what happens isn't good.  I can't even remember what it was.  I've blocked it out of my memory.  It must have been something that made you say, \\"Man, I don't buy this.\\"  The movie kept looking like it was going to end, but wouldn't, so my friends and I just got up and walked out of the theater.<br /><br />This movie shouldn't have been bad.  It just was.  Did the producers try to film the movie chronologically as its script was being written and become pressed for time at the end?  I don't know what the deal was.  Read the book.  Forget this adaptation of it.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Normally, a new Dream Theater album is an experience worth waiting for. This was certainly the case with every one of DT's previous albums, including their 3 live albums. Unfortunately, this is not one of those instances. This album lacks focus, sounds too pop-pish, doesn't have enough heavy music, tries to be too many things for too many people, etc etc, you get the drift. Every song is a disappointment. After suffering through the first seven tracks, I had high hopes for the closing, 24-minute title track. I should have known better. The intro is a shameless rip-off of Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond'', right from the gentle atmospheric keyboards to the distant, chiming guitar riff. The rest of the track rips off Yes and Genesis, even down to a reference to a \\"\\"machine messiah'' which is a Yes song on their Drama album. If I had to use a single word to sum up this CD, it would be \\"\\"insipid''. Petrucci's guitar sound is weak and buried in the background, even for the few solos he plays. As a guitar player myself, this is sacrilege. Rudess' keyboard sound is fine, but the melodies are nothing great. Portnoy and Myung do their part to hold it together and adding an orchestra was a nice touch but it isn't enough to save this bloated, over-indulgent waste of money. I own all DT's records and DVDs and all have been played at least 10-20 times. This won't follow suit.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have to say, this is one of the best albums of all time. <br />After releasing \\"All that you can't leave behind\\", this is an amazing follow up. I still don't know how they're keeping their music so good after 10 albums. <br /> <br />Vertigo - This isn't so great after several times you've listened to it, but it is really catchy at the beginning. 8/10 <br /> <br />Miracle Drug - One of the best songs of all time. Every U2 fan would like it right away. It has great rythm and is very addictive. It should have been at least the second single. 10/10 <br /> <br />Sometimes you can't make it on your own - Simply irrestible. Fantastic rythm. Great slow song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Love and Peace or else - It's a good song. I like the retro twist to it. 8/10 <br /> <br />City of Blinding lights - Probably my favorite song on the album. It's a great song to listen to. The chorus builds up the energy to the song, and the verses are very exciting. 10/10 <br /> <br />All Because of you - Probably the worst song on the album. (How is it a single already?...)It is similiar to vertigo, because of the rock theme. It's not really good, but it is good in some way. I like the lyrics in it. 7/10 <br /> <br />Man and a Woman - What a great song! With fantastic lyrics, a great melody, and a great bass to it, it at least deserves a 9. 9/10 <br /> <br />Crumbs from your table - A super fantastic song. Like I said, I still don't know how they're still finding these amazing tunes, and this is a super irresistible song. I love the guitar tune. It's hard to say it's a bad song. 10/10 <br /> <br />One Step Closer - I have to say just because it's slow it's still good, and it is a great slow song when you're sad. 8/10 <br /> <br />Original of the species - Super. Fantastic. Great. This song can make you happy or sad. It is so amazing. It should become a single. 10/10 <br /> <br />Yahweh - What a great ending to the album! Again, it can make you happy or sad, and if everyone listens to this song, Ibet they will all like it. 10/10 <br /> <br />This album is fantastic and I reccomend it for anyone. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

I'LL BE TAKING THIS BACK AND TRADING IT IN TOMORROW. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS 2 STARS IS FOR THE EFFORT AND ENERGY OF THE MUSICIANS..........
B000002L7Y|5.0|I'm an absolutely huge fan of 80s music, and I've yet to find a pop album I enjoy more from start to finish than \\"Hunting High And Low\\". The funny thing is that when my fiance bought it for me, I listened to \\"Take On Me\\" and shut it off! Not in the right frame of mind, I suppose. But the songs are well-written, well put-together, beautiful sung, and very interestingly produced. <br /> <br />The album starts out, of course, with \\"Take On Me\\", which I enjoy as much now as I did watching it on MTV as a kid. Those high notes Morten Harket hits still amaze me and are a great source of pain to my pets' ears as I try to sing along! <br /> <br />Next is \\"Train Of Thought\\", an intriguing song both because of its sound and lyrics. Upbeat without being a dance tune, it feels like you're being swept along on that train. The contrast in Morten's voice between this and \\"Take On Me\\" is interesting--here it's a deep, dramatic baritone. <br /> <br />Ah, \\"Hunting High And Low\\", a lovely ballad with interesting layers of production. The lyrics and Morten's voice are heart-rending against the orchestral background. Even the seagulls briefly crying in the middle of the song are perfect, highlighting the sense of empty loneliness. <br /> <br />\\"The Blue Sky\\" is one of those deceptively upbeat songs concealing thoughtful, even depressing, lyrics about life and loneliness. Again interesting production--listen carefully in the second and fourth verses for an undertone in the lyrics that startled the heck out of me the first time I listened to it on headphones. Actually, listen to the entire album on headphones sometime, it's richly textured. <br /> <br />\\"Living A Boy's Adventure Tale\\" was the first non-TOM track I warmed up to. The oboe adds a unique sound; again the lyrics are lovely, and Morten gets to explore quite a bit of his vocal range. <br /> <br />\\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\" is a song I was horribly prejudiced against because of the video--couldn't leave the happy ending of \\"Take On Me\\" alone, could they! But once I got past that I began to really appreciate the lyrics (again!) and the way all three different-sounding sections fit together. Don't be deceived by the slow start! It takes almost a full minute to get through the almost hymnal-sounding intro, and then it's actually a pretty guitar-driven track. <br /> <br />\\"And You Tell Me\\" is, I think, the weakest part of the album, but I still love it. Simple and sappy, it doesn't display the depth of songwriting the others do, but it's nice enough. <br /> <br />\\"Love Is Reason\\" is also more simplistic lyrically, but cheerful, poppy, and sung with a sincerity rare to today's pop songs. <br /> <br />\\"I Dream Myself Alive\\" sounds, to me, the most dated due to the squeaky-sounding synthesizers, but the lyrics are stirring, and two minutes into the song there's an interesting chatter of chaotic voices--I'm still trying to figure out what's being said, but it's neat. <br /> <br />\\"Here I Stand And Face The Rain\\" is an excellent crescendo to the album--it begins with monk-like chanting and soft guitar strumming, building into sighing synthesizers, a steady pop beat, and my favorite part: the layering of a chorus of Morten Harkets! The lyrics strike me as a little teenage-angsty, but still true--sometime we all stand and face the rain, and fear for what tomorrow brings. <br /> <br />You should buy it--if you've half an ear for quality music, you won't be disappointed. <br />
0064400557|5.0|E.B. White, the master of the English language and co-writer (with Strunk) on the handy textbook found on so many shelves of students of all ages, delves now into a treatise on the power of the written word in brilliant, storytelling format that is enjoyed and cherished by children and adults alike. \\"Radiant!\\" is the advertisement that Charlotte the spider and Wilbur's best friend Fern choose to display in order to save Wilbur, the little pig. Charlotte the spider is an advocate and friend with the intelligence and goodwill to save him.     The written word has the power to save and to heal; children may see what adults no longer see, and intelligence and goodness sometimes go together, at least in the case of Charlotte,who fortunately has many offspring!    This book belongs on every child's bookshelf-and adults should re-read it regularly so they never forget the wonder of childhood and how to find the right words to protect and honor innocent creatures great and small.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Don't be deceived by all the whiners giving this album bad reviews because it's different! In browsing through reviews I've seen comments that Morten Harket's voice is off key in places (true enough--when it lends to the song. It's intentional people.), the songs all sound different from each other (this also is true and I thing it's exceptional), there's no catchy pop songs (I have them all stuck in my head on a daily basis, personally), and assorted other whining showing a complete lack of appreciation for the maturation of a-ha as musicians and song-writers. (/end soap box) The fact is this album is a collection of introspective songs with interesting melodies and gorgeous singing (a crush on Morten Harket? Who me? :) ). Here come the song descriptions, if you want to bottom line skip down.    The first song is the title track. Moody and atmospheric with a steady, driving guitar rhythm, it features sparse and ever-so-slightly echoing lyrics with a light touch of soaring synthesizers and occasional orchestral emphasis. It sounds astral, I wasn't really surprised at all that the video takes place on the moon.    Next up is \\"Little Black Heart\\", a Magne/Paul collaboration which begins with some gentle guitar work and slowly rolls into a minor-keyed techno-pop verse, followed by a brief ascent into a lyrical chorus. Lather, rinse, and repeat that pattern and then soar into a hopeful bridge: \\"someday we will shine/like the moon in the morning/like the sun when it's dawning\\". It defies the bitter melancholy of its title.    The romantic-sounding \\"Velvet\\" is third, and a simple but lovely song it is, dominated by soft guitar strumming and soaring lyrics. This is also on the soundtrack to \\"One Night At McCool's\\" and has a delightfully morbid video. I also think it's much, much better than the original version--sorry Savoy, but nothing tops Morten's voice for sheer beauty.    \\"Summer Moved On\\" is THE song that caught me. Morten's voice is heartbreaking, and the 20 secondlong note (proceeded and followed immediately with other lyrics) blows me away every time. The guitar work is lovely, the background vocals are perfectly subtle, and the rhythm of the song is gorgeous, particularly Morten's voice soaring up and being punctuated by a burst of dramatic strings. I can't say enough about how much I love this song. Listen to it! And then get \\"How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head\\" and hear it live and be amazed at that 20 second note all over again. I think it may be the overall best song Paul has ever written.    \\"The Sun Never Shone That Day\\" feels lighter and less intense afterwards, a very pop dance tune with characteristically depressing lyrics. Can't help but love it for its upbeat and happy sound.    \\"To Let You Win\\" starts out with a ringing of church bells and slowly simmers throughout. It's one of two songs on the album co-written by Morten, and it does sound significantly different from Mags' and Paul's tunes. It took a while to grow on me, but it's got a soothing groove, Morten in a deep baritone for most of it, and gently regretful lyrics.    \\"The Company Man\\" ... well, this one is still growing on me, to be honest. The music is great and groovy, but I always struggle when artists do those \\"rock and roll experience\\" songs (Bon Jovi \\"Garage Band\\", Eric Clapton \\"You Were There\\" immediately come to me) because they're difficult to do without becoming cheesy and/or self-righteous. But the overall sound of this song is pleasant, and it doesn't damage the album.    Morten's second contribution, \\"Thought That It Was You\\", is next, and is my current \\"flavor of the day\\". I do find myself debating its meaning a bit--there are some very obvious Christian references, but then also a couple of other lines that don't fit that mold. The music is difficult to describe, as it varies frequently from hardly noticeable to heavy on a sparkling-sounding synthesizer and an interesting guitar sound. The chorus is lovely--I just love Morten's voice on those soaring higher notes ...    ... which we get plenty of in \\"I Wish I Cared\\", the only song on the album written exclusively by Magne. I was quite surprised to find they released this as a single--would definitely not fly on American radio, just doesn't have the right sound. But we get plenty of Morten's vocal strength, simple but meaningful lyrics (\\"this is how it has to be/no more us and no more we\\" gets me every time), and gently undulating music under it all.    \\"Barely Hangin' On\\" I just barely discovered but I already love it. It reminds me very much of early Beatles in terms of lyrics, execution, and there's even a jangling in the background that reminds me of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". Towards the end of the song there's a skipping sort of verse leading up to the final crescendo of the chorus in a satisfying way.    \\"You'll Never Get Over Me\\" is the other song with a major vocal contribution from Lauren Savoy; although I like the rising and falling play between her and Morten's voices, her pronunciation sounds little-girlish. This song features some beautiful guitar, and is extremely well put-togther--another of my favorites. Put some headphones on and listen carefully for the subtle doubling of Morten's voice, particularly the words \\"whenever our voices speak/it's never our minds that meet\\". This is one of those places people without an ear for music might think Morten is off-key, but it's really a subtle blending of harmonies. Really a lovely breakup song, with one of those fun false endings. Just when you think it's over you get your heart pulled back into your throat.     \\"I Won't Forget Her\\" is a crazy retro-sounding song. Extremely poppish, but very smooth and groovy. The vocals are excellent (as always) and there are a number of interesting synthesizer riffs. Another good one for the headphones. The kind of song that if you close your eyes and lie still, you might find yourself floating in the depths of it. Or maybe that's just me.    \\"Mary Ellen Makes The Moment Count\\" ... ah, a-ha does \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". I think this is the weakest song on the album for that reason alone--it reminds me so strongly in content of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" that I find myself unable to enjoy it. Just makes me was to dig out my Beatles albums.    So here's the thing: it ain't \\"Hunting High And Low\\". Nor \\"Memorial Beach\\", nor anything in between. \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\" is its own shining example of how artists can change and still be great. It's an eclectic collection of songs to be sure, the only steady factor being Morten Harket's voice, but it works, and quite well. I consider it one of the best albums I own. I'd put it in the same league as The Cure's \\"Disintegration\\" or \\"Bloodflowers\\", in its own quirky a-ha way, but it may fall short of the sheer greatness of \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" or Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\". Time will tell.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a classic book that describes four simple concepts in depth enough so that they can stay with you and have a positive influence in your life. I love the presentation of the book, small in size, however the messages are well worth the read.  <br />1. \\"Be Impeccable with your word\\" <br />2. \\"Don't take anything personally\\" <br />3. Don't make aassumptions <br />4. Always do your best <br /> <br />5. This is a five star book, and a must read.
B00082IJ08|4.0|That person nailedit right on. I wouldn't go so far as to give it 5 stars though. Mostly because a couple tracks grow (and in some cases start) to be so abnoxious that it will nearly deter you from listening to the rest of the disc. Don't be one of those people easily fooled. For the most part this disc is a breath of freash air. Especially considering the lackluster efforts of nearly every other veteren act... sorry Foo Fighters, Audioslave, and Weezer.

B00005OM4N|1.0|I bought Britney Spears' third album (Britney) two years ago, and I thought it was good at first, but then I realized that modern-day music is not the music for me.  My mother's old music from the '50s and '60s is a lot better!
8186336141|5.0|I rate the book highly on almost all counts, especially: <br />- comprehensiveness (some books ignore cleansing techniques, mudras, bandhs, spiritual areas, and some even ignore pranayama - this book covers all these areas as comprehensively as a book should) <br />- detail - would help if this is text is the constant companion of a yoga practitioner - the latter can read, re-read, and re-read many sections of the book and learn new things every time and integrate them into the practice <br />- spiritual orientation - correctly followed the book would help practitioners gain deep spiritual awareness (explains chakra focus during asanas) <br />- progression - the book begins with very basic practices and progresses to complex practices <br />Thoroughly recommended - however, a book cannot replace the guru
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I am a die hard fan of the Foo Fighters.  Often it seems it they addequately extend what Nrivana could have been today, but no one really knows... the albums are more accurately tributes, though they do not not blatantly claim to be, and often trancend their intended topics.  The first self titled album, though poorly engineered, was pure genious, but there has been a steady decline since.  Still, for whatever reasons, I am faithful enough to buy everything they put on the shelf, without question.  Now, I don't even own a CD player.  My iPod is my CDPlayer.  I bought the new album online, in faith that no such limitations (such as not being able to listen to it on my iPod) would exist... that the Foo Fighters, of all bands, would never agree to such a ridiculous limitation... especially for all of us faithfull (money giving) fans.  OK, so maybe the label had the bigger say, but as I listen to the album while I write this... it wreaks of a last ditch effort to make maximum money before dissapearing of the face of the earth... this is indeeed the end of the Foo.  Now that I have bypassed the default install and can actually listen to the music, I can begin to be objective on the music itself despite all the efforts against me actually hearing it.  Because I love the Foo sound, the songs will probably grow on me (have I mentioned how alienating it is to have crippleware in my CD drive instead of something functional and meaningful to the cause?). So, in summary, what I've heard (halfway into CD2) I've heard none of the typical grabs I trust the Foo Figthers to pull.  Perhaps I'm being overcritical... perhaps I'm pissed off at MediaMax... perhaps this album will just dissapoint.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This CD is probably my favorite rock CD that I have ever owned. I bought it back in like 1996 and I have always thought it was amazing. With Dave Grohl as the one-man band the over-dubbing is seamless and I had no idea that it was just him that did everything until a few months back. Also just the sheer variety of styles that are used on this CD is something that I don't think could be equalled. Sadly to say I have heard more recent Foo Fighters music and it could never compare to the first one. Nevertheless, this CD is most definitely a 5 out of 5.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the Eagles twice in Melbourne. From watching them perform live in concert and then viewing this DVD it's just unbelievable. The effort the Eagles go to to perform there songs the way we all like to her them is amazing. The DTS surrond sound on this DVD is first class aswell as the visual footage itself. No-less than 30 songs which include solo hits from Henley, Frey and Walsh. Crank up the volume and be amazed at the Eagles Farwell 1 concert.
0393057658|5.0|You need not be a baseball fan to appreciate Michael Lewis' MoneyBall. Lewis tracks Oakland A's GM Billy Beane, who built a series of powerhouse ballclubs with a major handicap. Despite having a payroll that was petty cash to teams like the Yankees, Beane's clubs excelled. A series of excellent finishes, culminating with a playoff series that took the Yankees to the limit, solidified Beane's reputation. But how did he do it? <br /> <br />Beane's unconventional methods were the key. Using Bill James (of Baseball Abstract fame) as an inspiration, the A's GM hired the best and brightest statisticians and dispensed with the conventional wisdom of opinionated scouts. So what if a college catcher had a \\"bad baseball body\\"? Beane didn't care. He was concerned with metrics like on-base-percentage, which turns out to be much better at predicting major league success than a scout's biased opinion. <br /> <br />Dealing with players as business units, each with measurable ROI (return on investment), Beane bought low and sold high. If a closer cranked out a bunch of saves, Beane figured he could trade the pitcher for higher value than he was really worth. Saves were a misleading statistic: strikeouts, walks, and home-runs-allowed were really the only true ways to measure a pitcher's performance. A \\"superstar\\" was simply a stat-generating machine and if the same amount of money could be leveraged on someone else that could yield similar stats, why not make a trade? <br /> <br />In retrospect, like all great ideas, Beane's tenets are remarkably simple. It's just interesting that it took baseball over a century to figure out that stats like ERA and RBI were pretty much meaningless. What mattered were stats that historically proved to be predictors of baseball victories: on-base-average and slugging average for batters, for instance. A quick, fascinating read, MoneyBall is an elegant look at a smart GM and his godfather: Bill James.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|The whole thing opens up with a background full of stars.<br /><br />The general plot:<br />The movie talks about Luke Skywalker. A young man who lives with his Aunt (Aunt Beru) and Uncle (Uncle Owen). Uncle Owen buy 2 droids who are 3P0 and R2D2. Luke is asked to clean the 2 droids when there is a beautiful woman who appears asking help from Obi Wan. R2D2 runs away to find it's master (Obi Wan), so Luke and 3P0 has to find them. When they do, they meet up with Obi-Wan who offers to take Luke with him on the mission. Luke hesitates and has to ask his uncle and aunt only to find out that they're killed and burnt. Luke has no choice but to go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan. They go to Mos Eisly to find a pilot which is Han. Finally, they go off to Alderaan but before they even reach the planet, it got destroyed by Darth Vader with his Space Station, The Death Star. They try to go back to Tatooine only to be sucked into the Death Star. Luke finds Leia. Obi-Wan leaves them to face Darth Vader and gets killed during their duel. They go back to the Rebel base and group together with the other Rebels to destroy the death Star. Luke ends the movie with a successful destruction of Death Star. The ending is quite touching with the throne room. The triumphant music goes together with it the whole time.<br /><br />About the film:<br />This movie is practically better than the new ones now, in the YEAR 2005! I was not born in 1977 yet but when I watched it in the early 2000s, I really didn't think it was made in the 1970s. The style and the whole scenes, they were really spectacular. The special effects, they were magnificent. Even though the technology before wasn't that great, but the way it conveyed generally was so WOW!<br /><br />This original Star Wars Movie introduced to the world something new and unique. Lightsabers, jedi, lightspeed. Anyone who watches the movie would enjoy it.<br /><br />Kirstie Mabitad
6305781427|5.0|Regardless of what others said about the quality of the DVD, it's a pure joy to watch! Let me assure potential buyers that the sound and video qualities are totally acceptable unless you're a serious audio/videophile. To refrain from buying it because of these trivial imperfections is quite silly in my opinion. <br /> <br />I really believe that this is one concert that everyone will love - regardless of their age and music preference. All musicians get to showcase their talents and yet all the different elements (bass guitar, percussion, drums, keyboards, the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra) somehow manage to fuse together into dynamic and truly enjoyable music. And of cause the gem in the performance has to be Karen Briggs who staked her claim to fame as the Lady in Red after this. Her violin duet with Shardad Rohani was positively overflowing with energy and spontaneity. You could see both of them totally enjoying themselves! <br /> <br />Regardless of whether you're a rock / blues / punk / jazz lover or classical aficionado, do yourself a favor and buy this. I've only got mine for less than 1 week and i've already watched it for more than 5 times. Highly recommended for all music lovers!
B00003CXC7|5.0|It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's \\"Rear Window\\" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like \\"Miss Torso\\" and \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\".  But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.<br /><br />Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script.  Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in \\"Vertigo\\" but still likeable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character.  Robert Burks' probing camerawork makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark filmmaking style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work.ile Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom.

Staw Wars, Lord of the Rings, and the like.   <br /> <br />I kicked and screamed the first time my wife (then my fianc) made me watch Pride and Prejudice right up through the third or fourth episode.   <br /> <br />I love this miniseries now!  My wife will invite all of her girlfriends over to watch it and I find myself defying all reason and watching it with them.  The chemistry between Darsy and Elizabeth is incredible.  Lydia and Mrs. Bennett are just plain annoying, which is half the fun and Mr. Bennett's wit is so entertaining.  If your husband/boyfriend will consent to sitting though five hours of Pride and Prejudice, I think there's a good chance that he will enjoy it (you may have to offer something pretty hefty in return.  I made my wife watch the entire Star Wars trilogy with me).  And you ladies out there that haven't committed yet, what are you waiting for? <br /> <br />Cheers

B0009OPO0S|5.0|Shakira appears to have taken a step back from her acclaimed latin-rock to unveil a self-produced album of exquisite vocals and musical freshness. Fijacion Oral shows a more mature Shakira, who has the confidence to incorporate jazz, rock, latin-rap, salsa rhythms and a bit of a classic 80s tone into an upbeat and rhythmical album.  Only two of the 12 songs have clear ties to her previous music.  Few artists today display the vocal control and playfulness that Shakira has come to master, and shows so greatly in this album. Whether you want to dance, dream, relax, or simply be enchanted this album is a must have.
B0000648WZ|4.0|Although based on a classic science fiction novel, this is not really a science fiction film.  It is a war film.  Unfortunately the writers do not know war and combat. <br /> <br />Humans are spreading through the galaxy.  Intelligent insects are also spreading through the galaxy.  Where the two meet there is usually bloodshed and slaughter.  Then actual war breaks out when the bugs send an attack against Earth.  The movie follows the careers of three young people who have signed up with the military right out of school.  The occupy positions in the infantry, fleet, and intelligence (although there seems to be little intelligence used). <br /> <br />The movie is a little confused as it is part commercial and part film.  It is like the whole thing is a recruitment film (except for all of the death).  The military tactics are utterly stupid.  For instance, when you land on a planet of bugs that crawl, swarm, hop and fly, be sure to use open-air enclosures to ensure the lowest possible safety levels.  The bugs themselves are also contradictory.  Throughout most of the film we will see five or six soldier pour hundreds of rounds of automatic fire into a bug before it collapses.  Later, a single soldier starts picking off bugs with single shots (yeah, right). <br /> <br />But still, in the end it is a fun film but you just can't think too much about the details (like the asteroid big enough to effect the gravity on a glass of water, but on nothing else in the ship).  For outright action this one is hard to beat and action films really aren't known for keeping details straight anyway, so enjoy. <br />
B000274THQ|4.0|Many on both sides of the Berlin Wall were only too ready to embrace change in 1989 whereas one person missed it all because of being in a coma - and when that person is a committed socialist with a total belief in the socialist ideals and dogmas of the state, what does one do? Tell her just like that? Or else pretend that nothing had happened? Such is the unusual dilemma facing young Alex Kerner (Daniel Brhl), whose mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), as seen in (suitably grainy) family footage, immersed herself in anything to do with the Communist Party and its activities, including the Young Pioneers (the socialist equivalent of Scouts and Guides) shortly after her husband had fled to the West at a time when the German \\"Democratic\\" Republic (GDR) was rapt in the first flight of a citizen, Sigmund Jhn, into space on board the then-extant Soviet space station, Mir.    On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Alex joins many citizens calling out \\"Keine Gewalt!\\" (\\"No violence!\\"), as they demonstrate peacefully for change in their country. Christiane, meanwhile, is on her way to a party meeting, but gets caught up in the demo and witnesses her son being dragged away by the \\"Volkspolizei\\" (GDR police). Son's and mother's eyes meet momentarily, and she collapses in the street. Alex wants to help her, but he is unceremoniously dragged on board a truck and beaten as he and others are taken to the local jail. Unexpectedly, he is released without charge as the authorities apparently know who his mother is. He dashes off to the hospital, where he finds her with all manner of tubes connected to her body. He also discovers later that a girl he met at the demo just happens to be a nurse called Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) with whom he eventually falls in love.    Events move fast, and the Wall comes down the month after Alex's mother had slipped into her coma. Change is so rapid that Alex, whose love for his mother is as unswerving as hers is for the socialist homeland, fears that she may even die from the shock of realizing that her beloved socialist homeland has been replaced by a capitalist one. With the need for East Germans and West Germans to co-operate, Alex joins a satellite TV company from the western side and becomes part of an East-West team with Denis (Florian Lukas). It turns out that Denis is a wizard at making movies, so he hits upon the idea of fooling his mother with fake TV programmes (connected to hidden video recorders) that convey the idea that his mother's beloved socialist homeland was still very much alive.    They make arrangements to ensure that everything is as normal as possible, including redecorating an entire room to look exactly like her mother's old bedroom and finding old bottles, glass jars and tins with familiar food labels on it - pickles from Holland won't do, so Alex must look in the most unlikely places for them! As she comes \\"home\\" after eight months in a coma, everything really does seem to be as normal - so long as she never leaves the bedroom. Aspects of \\"old\\" GDR life are seen as Alex persuades young and old, including disillusioned old Party activist Herr Ganske (Jrgen Holtz), to celebrate his mother's birthday by singing patriotic socialist songs about the homeland, though the game is almost given away by the untimely unfurling over a tall neighbouring apartment block wall ... of a Coca-Cola ad! Alex and Denis quickly dream up a way to provide a plausible explanation for the presence of this capitalist drink - a faked documentary that convinces Christiane that Coca-Cola actually came from the East!     Later on, while Alex sleeps in the apartment, Christiane slips out of bed and into a world which has, indeed, changed, and she stares incredulously at the sight of West German Mercedes and Audi cars parked in the street, a billboard advertising IKEA furniture and at a statue (without legs) of Lenin, right arm outstretched, being carried under a helicopter, presumably to be scrapped, figuratively symbolizing the impending death of Communist rule in the GDR. The statue, in a somewhat bizarre way, appears to beckon to this disbelieving socialist stalwart as the helicopter flies past her. A shocked Alex and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) manage to hustle their wayward mother back to bed, but it is clear that the game has to end at some point.    Just as Alex is about to reveal the deliberate deception during a family outing to the countryside, however, Christiane, in turn, makes a startling confession as to what really happened to her husband Robert (Burghart Klaussner) - and the alternative choice that she could have made for herself and her family, only for her to get cold feet and turn it down. So, now the shoe was proverbially on the other foot, as she begged forgiveness from her family from having lied to them all this time, unaware of the lies that Alex and company had been telling her.    Having suffered yet another timely heart attack, she is taken to hospital again where, thanks to Denis, the deception ends with one last fake TV programme, which, given it does include genuine news archive footage of the momentous events surrounding the fall of the Wall, apparently convinces Christiane that many West Germans had found life on the western side too materialistic and shallow for their liking and seemed ready to embrace the socialist ideal, conveying the idea that there was more to life than just buying things. Christiane seems to be so happy, and she eventually dies just three days after the reunification of West and East Germany. Alex is both sad at his mother's death, but happy that she died happy, still apparently convinced that the socialist dream was intact even now. However, what Alex does not know was that she had, in fact, found out about the deception - through Lara, of all people. In a complete reversal of roles, she, in effect, becomes the deceiver rather than the deceived by deceiving her son into thinking that she had not known anything, yet she realises that he had done what he did to protect her, so she does this to \\"protect\\" him from his own \\"reality\\".    Along with Bernd Lichtenberg, who wrote the screenplay, Wolfgang Becker co-wrote and directed this German movie, made by X Filme Creative Pool, the same company that made \\"Run Lola Run\\" (see my review), but distributed by Warner Bros for a worldwide audience. In total contrast to Winfried Bonengel's \\"Fhrer Ex\\" (see my review), this movie almost romanticizes what life was like in the socialist GDR, thus perhaps adding to the idea that socialism, for people like Christiane, really was a perfect dream for ordinary people - and, indeed, Alex helped to perpetuate that dream, even if the brutal realities of Communist life in the GDR go no further in this movie than the brief scene of rows of detainees with hands behind their heads in the prison itself before he is released.    A parallel could be drawn between this movie and \\"Fhrer Ex\\": Tommy and Heiko from \\"Fhrer Ex\\" embrace neo-Nazism after their brutal treatment in jail whereas, before, they had never harboured such political ideology. Christiane, in this movie, had never embraced the socialist ideal before the Stasi (the GDR secret police) came looking for her absent husband. It seems that she had adopted this ideological stance as a kind of \\"mask\\", as if trying to hoodwink people (and, ultimately, herself) into thinking that she had fully embraced socialism and that her husband had fled because he had the \\"wrong\\" attitude. However, it seemed that it had gone so far over a period of over a decade that she really did believe in the ideal, thus indicating that one might eventually believe an ideal if it suits their situation where circumstances warrant.
B00080Z53O|5.0|is this brilliant film about a quadraplegic (sp?) who wishes to end his life.  That's the simplistic story of this movie. I've read a number of the reviews here and they're excellent, and go into greater detail. Kudos to the actors, director, writers and everyone involved.  There is not a false move from beginning to end.  Do not know what, if any, awards this movie has received....I hope they are many.
B00006JDU9|4.0|Chronologically, \\"Episode I - The Phantom Menace\\" is supposed to be the first of a six-part saga, yet one gets the feeling right at the start that one is in the middle of something, almost as if there ought to have been a prequel before this one, as the vessel carrying two alleged \\"ambassadors\\" representing the Galactic Republic approaches one of the droid control vessels participating in a \\"legal\\" blockade of the planet Naboo. The \\"ambassadors\\" are none other than two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who have come to enter into \\"negotiations\\" with the \\"greedy\\" Trade Federation regarding the blockade.  <br /> <br />As Kenobi points out, they certainly were, only the outcome was, to say the least, not what was expected: a droid army is poised to invade Naboo. The Jedi smuggle themselves, undiscovered, on separate vessels and end up on the surface of Naboo. They encounter a rather dizzy-headed local, a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who agrees to take them (apparently on pain of death) to his city, where Boss Nass (Brian Blessed) has little time both for the Jedi and the Naboo and dismisses them, albeit after he agrees to give them a transport and to let Binks accompany them. Plying the planet core has its own, rather fishy hazards, but they manage to get to the city, albeit after Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and her entourage have been captured. A quick light-sabre fight despatches the escorting droids and the entourage escapes with the help of Naboo pilots and, in the particular case of the Queen's vessel, a little astro-droid designated R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). <br /> <br />All is not well, however, as the ship is forced to divert to a planet called Tatooine owing to a malfunctioning propulsion system. Gui-Jon meets a rather sly and devious Troydarian named Watto (voiced wonderfully by Andrew Secombe, almost as if he were French!), who has exactly what they need, but credits won't do fine,much to his inner frustration. Amidala, disguised as a hand-maiden, encounters a little slave boy named Anakin (Jake Lloyd), who declares himself to be an avid pod-racer and being good at his hands, as his home-made protocol droid, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), shows, even if it is \\"naked\\", as R2-D2 points out. It turns out that he is not all he seems, but that would be to say that one already knows how he turns out later in life. All we should know now is that \\"there's something about this boy\\", given the snippets of evidence that attract Qui-Gon's attention: fast reactions and the fact that apparently he had no father, according to his mother Shmi (Pernilla August). Microscopic life-forms called \\"midi-chlorians\\" rest in the cells of all Jedi, and an analysis of the boy's blood reveals that he has them. Herein lies the apparent biochemical explanation for the \\"Force\\" (much to many fans' annoyance, as they would have preferred it to have remained mysterious and thus inexplicable). <br /> <br />However, the fact is that, without suitable parts for their ship, they are stuck, so it is up to Anakin to participate in a colourful, yet highly dangerous and no-holds-barred pod-race - and not just because of the natural obstacles, but also Tusken raiders and devious \\"slimeballs\\" like Sebulba (Lewis Macleod), upon whom Watto is prepared to bet everything. Qui-Gon seizes his chance to capitalize on Tatooine's main strength/weakness, gambling, and Watto unwisely accepts the bet that would result in the boy's freedom. The pod-race is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie, being as it is a nod to the chariot-race in the classic 1959 movie, \\"Ben-Hur\\", but should only be seen as a vital link to the chain of events that would see young Anakin part, almost tearfully, from his mother, who advises him to \\"be brave\\" and not look back. <br /> <br />Just when one thought one might relax, up comes a rather sinister light-sabre-wielding character, who briefly duels with Qui-Gon before the Queen's ship escapes to Coruscant, the home of the Jedi Council. There, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) outlines the situation: a weak leadership by Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) and \\"greedy, squabbling delegates\\" with \\"no interest in the common good\\". Political machinations are rife in the senate and, on Palpatine's advice, Amidala, now in full regalia, calls for a vote of no confidence in Valorum, since he apparently appears not to want to take immediate action as regards the invasion of her home planet. This vote is an opportunity immediately seized upon by the senate. In the meantime, Qui-Gon tells the Council, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the ever-wise Yoda (Frank Oz), of his conviction that the boy is the one to fulfil the prophecy of being \\"the Chosen One\\", yet Yoda sees danger in the boy, who fears losing his mother. Right here, Yoda makes references to the so-called \\"Dark Side\\", a path which he fears the boy will take - only more pressing concerns now require them all to travel to Naboo. <br /> <br />The Queen is determined to take back Naboo from the Trade Federation and Jar Jar proves a most unlikely link, as he succeeds in getting Boss Nass to help them. While a classic scene from the 1960 movie, \\"Spartacus\\", comes to mind as opposing armies (in this case, droid and Gungan) face each other, the Queen's party, including the Jedi and the captain of her royal guard, Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), succeed in entering the palace and capturing Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson, who also played the pilot of the ship seen at the start of the movie). However, the mysterious double light-sabre wielding character reappears: Darth Maul (Ray Park) takes on both Jinn and Kenobi in a scene that ranks amongst the best choreographed fight scenes on film reminiscent of Chinese martial arts (\\"Wu Xia\\") films. The two knights are separated, leaving one to face the attacker: one mistake proves fatal, and the end for one of the knights is predictable. It is therefore up to the other to avenge him, which he does. As he lies dying, Jinn makes Kenobi promise that he will train Anakin, a decision he had already taken, defying the wishes of the Council, who, at Jinn's sombre funeral, wonder who had been destroyed - the master or the apprentice Sith Lord: one gets an answer as the camera focuses in on Palpatine. <br /> <br />George Lucas's \\"Star Wars\\" had already had an established reputation more than two decades by the time \\"Episode I\\" came out, and a lot of the criticism of the movie has come from people who insist on comparing this with the movies that started the whole saga. Yet every story has a beginning, and, while some characters have been dismissed by some as \\"irritating\\" and some dialogue as \\"boring\\", the fact is that it would be totally unrealistic, as in real life, even in \\"Star Wars\\", NOT to have characters who some people may think are \\"irritating\\" and NOT to have dialogue which some people may think is \\"boring\\". As Qui-Gon himself said to Obi-Wan, \\"keep your concentration here and now\\": meaning, perhaps, that fans of the movies ought to bear in mind that this story takes place chronologically first and so should \\"forget\\" most, if not all, of what they know of what happens in the saga later - black masks, heavy breathing and all. <br />
B000068TSI|5.0|This is a difficult review to write.  There is power and insight in this movie that goes deeper than any given moment in any given war.  I will leave the discussion of the details to those that lived through them (Thank you for your service and your sacrifice!).    What is impressive about this movie is the statement it clearly makes about war and the human capital that is expended in war.  It is not so much an \\"anti-war\\" movie, as at least one reviewer mentioned, it is rather an honest examination of the respect and value (or lack of it) that we have for the positive qualities of a warrior in our culture.  Not the gung-ho, testosterone-poisoned caricacture of bloodshed for its own sake, but the essential quality of sucking it up when asked (or required by circumstances) to make a personal sacrifice to further the greater good--of service to one's family, comrades, country or ideals in both peaceful and horrific contexts. As such, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" can most accurately be described as an \\"anti-waste\\" movie.  What the movie ultimately portrays is the essential quality of true warriors (both male and female--how many men do you know that would have the courage to deliver those telegrams to people you know?) and what a precious resource that quality is--whether in peacetime doing good in the community or during war when it is expended in battle.  This movie squarely asks the question of whether we as a nation are willing to sacrifice our warriors (in whatever capacity) for less than the most important of reasons?  Given recent history, it appears that we are.  And that is the tragedy that is depicted here and what tears at you when you leave.    No need to wait until the end of this movie to start crying as suggested by another reviewer.  I was in tears after the first ten minutes.....    See this movie.  The odds are you will walk away with more insight than you came in with.  Even more perhaps, than you wanted or can continue to remain comfortable with.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I was given this album as a gift. Therefore I can be objective about the quality of the music and not have to defend my making a bad purchase.  I flipped thru the first cd (the \\"Loud\\") and could not find any one song that stood out as being worthy of \\"a hit\\". The second cd (the \\"soft\\" one) had maybe 2 1/2 tracks on it that might be worthy of a hit, and/or airtime.  Maybe if you're a fan and hung-up on this band you'll buy it for your collection.  Otherwise, this 2-set cd is going to fade away (and gather dust) rather quickly...
B00003CXHJ|5.0|This film went under the waves fairly quickly without earning especially high marks from either critics or audiences. After watching it more than once, and enjoying it more with each viewing, I have come to the conclusion that any picture about submarines made after Das Boot is going to seem short of the mark at first blush. Wolfgang Petersen's masterwork has left such massive footprints that simply making a submarine movie becomes an act of courage.<br /><br />I urge you to view this film on its own merits, which are many. It has a wonderfully tight script by Jonathan Mostow, which has many simple things to say about leadership and courage. Mostow makes his points cleanly without a lot of sugar. The characters develop in a very natural and believable way, particularly the character of Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Mathew McConaughey), who begins the film in a snit over a missed promotion and through the course of events has to mature greatly under fire. Helping him to learn about command is Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton in a refreshingly earnest performance). With a few simple lines of great dialogue, Dahlgren explains to Tyler the elements of command he has not yet understood, which leaves the young and struggling officer like a deer in the headlights. I won't quote dialogue here. It is much better to let the film speak for itself. You will recognize it when it comes. It really made me think about the character of a true leader in a new way, and I think that is the ultimate praise for a great piece of script writing.<br /><br />The film-makers also took tremendous care with the technical aspects of this movie, which I greatly appreciated, being a fan of submarine films. They truly did it right from bow to stern, and their care really shows. The special effects are tremendous as well. No CGI here, as the explosions nearly jump off the screen in real-time reverberations.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is full of wonderful performances with standouts being Harvey Keitel playing old salt, Chief Klough (who is also a player in teaching the young officer Tyler a thing or two about commanding a ship in the navy); and surprise of the day goes to Bon Jovi as Lieutenant Pete Emmet (yet hasn't this guy turned in enough good screen performances yet to rate being more than a \\"surprise\\"?). I also enjoyed the performance of Jake Weber, who plays Lieutenant Hirsch. It's a shame this actor doesn't appear in more big pictures. He perfectly captures the undercurrent of discipline and quiet steel necessary to bring his Navy intelligence officer to life.<br /><br />This is a powerful, satisfying film, well done in nearly every respect. I recommend it to fans of submarine warfare and anyone who enjoys an action film done in the grand, Hollywood style. -Mykal Bantang old salt, Chief Klough (who is also a player in teaching the young officer Tyler a thing or two about commanding a ship in the navy); and surprise of the day goes to Bon Jovi as Lieutenant Pete Emmet (yet hasn't this guy turned in enough good screen performances yet to rate being more than a \\"surprise\\"?).

B000002AVF|5.0|Daydream was the first CD I received. I was eight years old when I got this album and I fell in love with it. Mariah's vocals are on-point and the songs are fun and catchy. Anyone who has experienced trials and tribulations will enjoy this album. Mariah sings with emotion and she really makes you enjoy the songs and want you to sing with her. If it wasn't for Mariah I wouldn't sing. Because of her I sang in chorus for 8 years. What an inspirational rolemodel she was...
0763611883|5.0|As a new fan to Disney's Channels newest 15 minute show \\"Charlie & his little sister Lola\\". It made my day to find out it's author(Lauren Child) has published several Charlie & Lola books made my day! Her illustrations of Charlie and Lola are simple, but so loveable!!! The author definately has hung around,watched & researched children... it shows in her work!! She knows children and what an imagination she has! I tell you, I am an instant Lauren Child fan! I can't wait to get my hands on some of her other books!  <br /> <br />I love this book, and also the little Disney mini show on this book as well. I'd love to see a book made out of the \\" I'm Not the Sun\\" and the one with \\"Sizzles\\" the daushound. And maybe later on down the road....hopefully not too long down the road a several DVD's would be nice as well! If you get a chance... strike that make the time and check out the Disney Channelon when to catch 15 minutes of cleverness, great story telling and fun that both toddler, Mama and Da truly enjoy! Then pick up a this book and get your Charlie & Lola fix for whenever day or night you need your fix of Charlie and Lola!
B00004R9A4|1.0|I was nine years old when this film premiered, and it fired my high-strung creativity.  I found it engaging, enchanting, and creative -- downright magical, and I saw it about four times.  Soon afterward, I got a copy of Mary Norton's novel, expecting it to be the same story as this Disney film.  It wasn't -- it was a significantly better and more interesting story, with a nice bittersweet ending.  \\"Imagine that -- a book that's better than a movie!\\"  [OK, so I wasn't the most intelligent child in history.]  So I kept the book and forgot about the film.<br /><br />When this film was re-released in this DVD format, I thought I'd give it a viewing for old time's sake, fully bearing in mind that the plot is almost completely different than the Norton book.  Well, I was tremendously disappointed.  For all its colors and flying effects and animation and tricked-out uninhabited marching suits of armor and the sublime Angela Lansbury, this is a really mediocre film.  Yes, the claims of it being an unofficial \\"sequel\\" to \\"Mary Poppins\\" are easy to make and can almost be substantiated, but the creative team did a most lackluster job.  The flying is sloppy, the animation of the undersea/island sequence lacks the usual Disney cleverness, the songs by the usually top-notch Sherman Brothers sound like they were written while Richard & Robin were recovering from simultaneous root canals, and the child actors are unusually bland [even for British actors].<br /><br />But the \\"Portobello Road\\" musical number struck me as being the worst production number in film history -- worse even than the 1973 musical version of \\"Lost Horizon,\\" a notorious turkey.  It seems like the \\"Portobello Road\\" sequence was devised simply to have a large song & dance number, like the chimney sweep number in \\"Mary Poppins\\" or, more likely, the \\"Who Will Buy?\\" production number in \\"Oliver.\\"  But the Disney studio evidently wanted to save some money on this film, for this is one of the skimpiest numbers I've ever seen:  A forgettable tune, uninventive choreography, an appallingly small number of dancers, and a set that is so small and cheap that it looks like it was inserted from a bad dinner theatre production [and THIS actor has been trapped in his share of bad dinner theatre productions].<br /><br />I adored Disney films when I was growing up, but many of them have proved a disappointment to view again [I wish I'd never viewed \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" as an adult].  The Disney studio was always able to make films that both enchanted children AND were good enough storytelling for adults, but sometimes they weren't up to their own standards.  *sigh*<br /><br />In spite of all my grousing, I  DO  recommend this film for children under 15 -- it may help fire their imaginations in this age of increasingly bland pop culture.  But their parents will likely end up merely enduring the thing [though it IS interesting to see Miss Lansbury display her singing and dancing skills on film -- would that SHE was in \\"Mame\\" a few years later instead of Lucille Ball].  But if your kids like this film, go out and get them a copy of the Mary Norton book -- it's a better story, more plausible, teaches better lessons about life, and has a much more satisfying ending [albeit a bittersweet one].gettable tune, uninventive choreography, an appallingly small number of dancers, and a set that is so small and cheap that it looks like it was inserted from a bad dinner theatre production [and THIS actor has been trapped in his share of bad dinner theatre productions].

B0009HLDFU|1.0|Wow is this bad. Not that i listen to the foo fighters, I stoped listening to the them around 2001. But Man are they awful.<br /><br />1: All the songs sound the same<br /><br />2: Try a new sound...... Like death metal or drum and bass, indian music, Just try something new.... This is not 1995<br /><br />3: There are way better bands at being the Foo Fighters then The Foo Fighters<br /><br />What a rip off
B00005JLH3|4.0|If you enjoy marching bands and a pure drumline sound, crank your speakers up while watching the marching in this film. Excellent musicanship and showman ship are evident in the bands selected for this film. Having been a past band member, I fondly recall the excitement that flows during a performance. <br /> <br />The story, however, is a bit familiar at times. High school star goes to college, meets girl, makes friends but lets it all go because of an over-inflated ego. Devon Miles' (Nick Cannon) particular predicament is a good twist on the story but slightly predictable. Dr. Lee's (Orlando Jones) insistance on \\"One Band, One Sound\\" and his passion for musicianship will endear musician and watcher alike.  <br /> <br />On that same note, Orlando Jones' performance in this movie is outstanding and uncharacteristic of his usual roles. He truly creates a memorable character. <br /> <br />This movie makes great strides to depict the intense competition of Black College marching bands and does an admirable job. Each show is edgy, high impact, and full of excitement. Unfortunately, much of this goes unnoticed as \\"big\\" networks cut to commercials instead of showing the real entertainment at halftime. <br /> <br />Take the time to watch this film, all things aside, you'll be glad you did.
1400032717|1.0|The only reason I bought this book was because in one of the reviews they compared it to the great kite runner.That is a complete insult to the kite runner because this book isn't half of the wonderful book that kite runner is.There not even in the same category. Since the main character Christopher is autistic and also narrates the ENTIRE story he makes sure not to leave out any minute detail in his day to day life. In the first couple of pages it's cute and I guess a little comical because its a way the author helps make his disability more authentic but by the second chapter you grow tired of reading about everything the main charcter had to eat for the entire day or what color cars he saw on his way to school or how he knows all the prime numbers up to god knows what.I found I had to force myself to pick up the book once I got to the middle just to try to finish it, hoping it would get better when instead the boring plot just dragged on and on. I got to the point where I would skim through the pages that were excruciatingly detailed. Do yourself a favor and skip this not so comical and definitely not interesting book!!
B0000640VO|5.0|Don't be daunted with the prospect of a foreign film because you will miss out on a quirky heroine and her adventures. Amelie warms the heart and delights the senses with a rich story and amazing use of color.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Audrey Tautou's performance in her wide range of expression throughout the story. While the story itself is not overwhelmingly remarkable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and <br />Guillaume Laurant's way of telling it captures the viewer from the start. Color plays an integral role in this film, rather reminiscent of Technicolor in the early days of film. It's almost hypersaturated but only serves to enrich the tale.  <br /> <br />To fully appreciate this film, watch it first in French with the subtitles to hear the nuances of the French language. I have also watched it dubbed in English but some of the voice inflections cannot be compared to the original French. <br /> <br />This is a very uncharacteristic and whimsical film. Like reviewers before me, I agree that you will either love it or hate it. I highly recommend it!
B0009XRZ9W|5.0|My mother and I took my two children, ages 3 and 5, to see the movie and we were both thrilled and surprised by their reactions.  My 3 year old, who normally can't sit still, barely moved or uttered a syllable during the entire movie.  They were truly enchanted by the story. For my mothere and I, watching my children watch the movie was so much fun that we had to go back a second time to see it ourselves. We took the kids, of course, and they enjoyed it just as much the second time. <br /> <br />Polar Express is definitely a Christmas classic.  The animation is amazing...especially the steam coming from the radiator and train.  Despite what some critics say, I thought that they did an excellent job in the animation of the characters.  Yes, they are at times a little less than perfect, but it did not detract from the experience. <br /> <br />The story was beautiful and held a beautiful lesson, but didn't hit you over the head with it as often happens in children's movies.  It was a real roller coaster ride and my children and I can't wait until November when it comes to video.   <br /> <br />As a side note, my children are still pretending the family van is the polar express when we go anywhere!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The story of the Phantom of the Opera is of a disfigured man who haunts the catacombs of the Paris Opera House and falls in love with a young chorus girl named Christine. She herself falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, while at the same time becomes entranced with the phantom. The phantom is played by Gerald Butler who ,in my opinion, portrays the angst of the phantom perfectly and brings out the sexual appeal that the phantom holds. There wasn't a part in the movie that I didn't love and I am looking forward to seeing this production on stage!
B0006284JQ|5.0|It always ceases to amaze me how some people will use a music review forum such as this to trash a persons personal life, musical talent, and a life long career of hard work.  You people that are doing this should be ashamed of yourself.  Not only is this girl talented musically, had the insight to use the technology of today's music, but she has worked EXTREMELY hard to get where she is today.  You can not fault or judge a person for fulfilling their dream, or using the gifts that were granted them.  Constructive criticism to an artists song or body of work is always welcomed by the artist and is a means for potential clients of the artist to decide if that artist's work is what they are looking for,........but bashing the artist, or entering areas of the artist's personal life, or prejudice,  has no place in this forum or anywhere else.  It is totally evident and proven in fact by multi-million dollars sales that yes Britney Spears is a talented girl, musically and otherwise.  To make a statement or to repeat the rumor that a multi-million dollar album lacks talent is not only ridiculous, but is ignorant.   <br /> <br /> <br />The album that I am rating for you good people to read, is a correlation of Britney's greatest hits......and are just that, HITS.  The album is a combination of soft, heart touching songs, and driving beat renditions with the creative use of techno sounds used in so much of the popular pop/rock music of our era.  The songs combine state-of-the-art recording quality with heavy professional mixing to create a total sound that is crystal clear and felt to the bone when the volume is turned up. It is a fabulous album to get your blood pumping, or getting your already tapping feet to the dance floor.  It is inventive and wonderful to experience.  If you love pop/rock music, you will certainly enjoy this album......it is A number #1. <br /> <br />A STORY TO PONDER: <br />Being a performing artist myself I can appreciated the countless hours of work that goes into each song before the public even hears the creation.  Personally I sing many of my own works, and the works of various artists including Britney Spears.  Just recently I sang to an audience three of Ms. Spears songs.  After the performance I was congratulated with praise on how wonderful the songs were by a elderly 60+ couple.  They had never heard the songs before, yet when they found out that the songs they loved were Britney songs......they both wrinkled up their noses.  I found it interesting and was a unique opportunity to ask this couple why?  They proceeded to tell me that they didn't like Britney personally..........thus they didn't like her music, nor would they ever listen to it.  I then asked them if they had ever met her, and they replied.....\\"No\\".  Then I asked them how could they knew they didn't like her if they had never met her.  In short, this elderly couple was speechless, and looked ashamed.   In their reality, in world filled with so much judgment, rumors and gossip, this couple had already condemned her, without the knowledge, without the facts.  I walked away from this couple thinking how sad and destructive this type of behavior is, passing judgment on another human being without evening knowing them, and worst of all.......repeating their preconceived notions to others.  <br />Merriam-Webster defines judgment as: \\"1 a : a formal utterance of an authoritative opinion.\\"  So I ask, if this is the case, and the key word here being \\"authoritative\\", how would you define the judgment of others as a non-authoritative opinion? Well, hummmmmmm........how about c r u e l. <br /> <br />_____White Wolf <br />
B000063DIR|1.0|Dont be fooled by the Osbourne money making machine, this half-assed reissue has nothing to do with giving fans a better version of a classic album, it has to do with screwing Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake out of royalties that are rightfully theirs. I honestly dont know what the hell is happening to Ozzy these days. Ever since \\"The Osbournes\\" he's been gaining legions of fairweather fans, alienating true fans and now screwing musicians over too! Its sad and pathetic. These people are rich as hell, but they're still so damn greedy that their own money isnt enough, they want Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake's money too?? I wont help $haron or O$$y with their cynical schemes, and I ask that you dont either. Dont let The Osbournes make a sucker out of you with this disgraceful CD. Stick with the original, it sounds better anyway.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is the Dream Theater cd that had such much to say. It's got wonderful melodies and texture and truly is a masterpiece. I often wonder or think that perhaps Kevin Moore's departure from DT was something the band has not yet fully recovered from? Awake was heavier, but a lot of the texture was still there. Overall I'd say this is their best cd and is truly a progressive masterpiece. These guys can play and play they do on this effort. This is one cd I never get tired of listening to.
0670033375|5.0|I have never looked at the world quite in the same way since reading Diamond's earlier book Guns, Germs, and Steel.  Every trip I've taken, every National Geographic article I've read, every newscast from a foreign country evokes a passage from that book.  Of all the books I've ever read, Guns has had the largest impact on my understanding of the world, and I could not imagine that another book could even approximate that significance.<br /><br />Well, Collapse is another such book.  Despite my intimacy with Guns, I still find Collapse fresh and just as mind altering.  So much is explained so simply.  Like Guns, it is not an easy read.  I do, however (and much to the surprise of my wife), find it a page burner.<br /><br />There are, of course, issues.  Despite the author's insistence that the reader set aside pre-conceived notions, his own prejudices about wealth and \\"big business\\" are front and center.  His incredible mastery of the English language belies certain of his own biases.  These aberrations are certainly tolerable, but damage his credibility with respect to the rest of the assertions made in the book.<br /><br />Recommending this book to others is a bit of a challenge.  I simply can't recommend either book highly enough.  But the reader has to be ready to work the book, not flip through it in an afternoon.  It's all transmit, and the reader has to be ready to receive.  For someone interested in the world who enjoys non-fiction and is willing to muscle into a dense work, this is the ultimate read.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000060OFT|5.0|Ok- let me start off with something : I was very skeptical of this movie. I typically don't like remakes or \\"modernizations\\" of classics like Romeo and Juliet But I was wrong. <br /> <br />Yes, the movie is modernized, but then again, it isn't. The use of Shakespeare for the script instead of a modernized script while at the same time updating Verona to the present day feels very dreamlike, like it isn't even happening on the planet.  <br /> <br />DiCaprio and Danes were perfect for these roles. I've seen too many movies from R&J and there was simply NO chemistry. That's not the case here. The lines aren't arch reproductions, \\"same old same old\\" stuff. The lines are spoken with frightening immediacy. This is important, because most remakes of this movie are far too elegant. This version captures the chaotic, euphoric passion of love that simply will not wait or be denied. The lines aren't just spoken, they elbow and push their way on to the screen. This is a major plus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Claire Danes is simply gorgeous. Hers is a unique kind of beauty. Not typical Hollywood fare. Another plus. <br /> <br />The only scenes I had trouble with were the first scene with the Capulet and Montague boys meeting at the gas station, and the first scene with Lady Capulet and Juliet.  <br /> <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie because, even though we all know the story, this movie still finds a way to be just as fresh as the first time we read/saw the play.  <br /> <br />Bravo.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon does exactly that with 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'. The story is unique - with not your conventional hero, and not a \\"perfect\\" scenario to weave a gripping story around. With a simple narrative, chapter after prime-numbered chapter, the fifteen year old protagonist Christopher puts across his view of the world and backs it with reasoning that quietly questions norm. Such as when Christopher explains his car-patterns, or his fondness for 'white noise', or his theory for 'what makes something interesting' to mention just a few. And this is just one aspect of the story. The book is as empathetic as is thought-provoking - notice how the author has not once used the term 'autism' or 'disability'. Even more incredible is how the author has managed to narrate a moving story without \\"adjectivising\\" any of it with sentimentalism. The effect is achieved to perfection.
6305784116|5.0|Disney's \\"The Aristocats\\" is probably one of the most underrated among all of them, in fact, every single Disney animated film to be released in the 1970's is remember to be cheap and bland, however, of the three main ones to be released, probably Robin Hood (1973) is the only one to be somewhat weaker.  I think people and critics just have it against \\"The Aristocats\\" and \\"The Rescuers,\\" not because they were bad, because they are certainly not, but because they came after Walt's death and they believed that nothing could ever stand up to his quality, although it must be stated, that the quality of his own films in the 1960's was very low.  Starting with weak and bland tales as \\"101 Dalmatians,\\" The Sword in the Stone\\" and \\"The Jungle Book\\" were far less interesting than \\"The Aristocats,\\" \\"The Rescuers,\\" or even those from the so called \\"dark age,\\" titles such as \\"The Fox and the Hound\\" and \\"The Black Cauldron.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Aristocats\\" is the story of a family of cats, Dutchess and kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse, destined to inherit the fortune of Madame Adelaide Bonfamille.  The old woman foreshadows her passing and decides it is time to prepare her will so that her beloved cats will be taken care of.  However, when Edgar, the greedy butler overhears the conversation between Madame and her faithful lawyer, Edgar decides to do the impossible to be the one to inherit the first term, for this he decides to catnap the 4 kittens and send them far away so that they'll never be heard from again.  His plan works and the kittens are sent away, still alive and missing their kind mistress, the four embark on a journey through the wild countryside of France, back to their home in Paris. <br /> <br />The story is classic Disney, and the film may be accused of being very similar to \\"101 Dalmatians,\\" however, this one is indeed 101 times better.  The Aristocats is more artistic, more colorful and with more memorable characters like the good Thomas O'Malley Cat and hisband of jazz-playing felines.  The Aristocats is somewhat more of an interesting story, it doesn't revolve only on the characters running back and forth with the villain after them, but it involves fun scenes with Edgar making sure his plan works and he seems to think a bit better than Cruella DeVil, although not making such an impact as the famous villainess. <br /> <br />The Aristocats is superiour to 101 Dalmatians, yet this film is treated as if it was the worst Disney had ever released, when they themselves know that not even them can pull such quality today.  Films like \\"The Aristocats\\" aren't being made anymore, good, clean comedy is over.  Very sad for Disney.  \\"The Aristocats\\" is highly recommended, however, the DVD is a bit poor.
B000002IOJ|4.0|It's tamed down a bit and become a little more melodic to make more sense to the casual thrash metaller like myself. I've always had respect for this band and in many ways believed they should have been bigger than they were. The simply fact is, once you start getting to fast and to furious you lose some of your audience. I'm not saying that's a bad thing of that thrash music isn't a great breed of metal, what I'm saying is the vast majority of people just don't understand it, which translates into limited exposure. Practice What You Preach is a fantastic effort from a great thrash band and that's really all that can be said about it.
B000002UB6|5.0|You know the story: by 1969 the Beatles were on the verge of a meltdown as the musical, personal, and business differences that had grown between them since Brian Epstein's death in late '67 came to a head. So in a last-ditch attempt to rescue what had really become HIS band Paul McCartney devised the Get Back project: the Beatles \\"getting back\\" to basic, straight-up rock & roll, live in the studio (and once on a rooftop) without overdubs. Ultimately this only served to erode even further a \\"marriage\\" that was already on the rocks, but it did produce some mighty fine music - as captured on 1970's \\"posthumous\\" Let It Be. <br /> <br />Neither John nor George had much interest in the group at the time and their contributions (Across the Universe, one of John's best ballads, notwithstanding) may seem rather slight. So it's a bearded, scruffy Paul that takes the reins and steals the show, throwing off anthemic ballads and classic rockers as easily as if he wasn't even trying. And there are two moments (primarily Paul songs though they both are) that showcase the Lennon-McCartney partnership one last time, as bold and as poignant as ever. It's hard to believe that these two were anything but the dearest of brothers after listening to their intertwined parts on I've Got a Feeling, or their loving duet on the stunning Two of Us. The performances themselves are bereft of all the studio trickery that had transformed rock & roll on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's - just the Fab Four (and keyboard legend Billy Preston, enlisted to ease the tension and beef up the sound), ragged but oh so right. <br /> <br />Of course, in such an atmosphere as Let It Be was created in, there are bound to be a few rough spots - a few unfinished ideas here, a little sloppy musicianship there. Not to mention the personal arguments, as chronicled (in part) on the documentary of the same name. But the most glaring is (surprise, surprise) Phil Spector, who was called in to salvage the project at the last minute and whose typcial over-the-top \\"Wall of Sound\\" production was heaped on several cuts (most notably Let It Be and The Long & Winding Road, much to McCartney's chagrin). Thank goodness the songs are strong enough to withstand it. <br /> <br />Of all the Beatles' albums, Let It Be has been most sorely mistreated. It may be the fact that after the grandiose swansong of Abbey Road, the rough-hewn epilogue of Let It Be seemed out of place. It may be that as the Beatles disintegrated critics felt the need to give them just one panning before their reign ended. I don't know. All I know is, it doesn't really deserve it, and is as direct, as human, and as classic a record as the Beatles ever released.
6305161992|5.0|There are so many cheesy things in this movie, things that don't make sense (why does that wheel blow up at the end????) that this movie is simultaneously cheesy and totally funny. I recommend this movie highly if you find corny movies hilarious.
B000002UD0|5.0|Way too much has been written over time about what was going on in Johns life when this record was cut.The painful seperation from Yoko,lost weekend,etc.For those who didnt try to figure out the complex Mr.Lennon,the news is good for rock and roll.This album just cooks.Some great songs only John could write,and tight players to lay it down.2 things set this apart for greatness:1.the terrific band and guests(Elton,Harry Nilsson)and best of all-2.no Yoko.I agree with those who say this is JL's best record.A must.
B000002MP2|1.0|I'll give this CD 1 star because Boulevard of Broken Dreams is <br />a good song. Other than that, I've heard Holiday and it is what <br />makes Greenday suck! Here's what to get.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I'm yet to like a Dream Theater effort more than Images and Words. That offering from this great band was outstanding! They've had heavier sounding cd's, Awake and Train Of Thought come to mind and then they have lighter sounding efforts such as Falling Into Infinity, Six Degree's Of Separation and maybe Scenes From A Memory. All of these efforts have been very good ones. Their is no doubting these guys can play and this style of music catches musicians and captivates our minds with mind blowing virtuosity. However for the average music lover, it can get a little to overwhelming at times. This band is really a musicians band as nobody else in their right mind would understand it or bother to try and get through it at one sitting. Dream Theater is my favourite wanker band and I'm not a big wanker type fan (are you listening Steve Vai?). Yes Dream Theater still tend to over play at times as it must be heard to harness such talent. Sometimes being a great musician doesn't mean you can write great songs as you tend to get carried away on technique and forget about substance. However these guys usually manage to pull it off nicely for the most part. Octavarium is a less guitar oriented effort, yet is still very much riff driven. Keys or shall I say texture over power, seem to be the driving force this time out and that's cool. Overall this is a fine effort and will no doubt stand the test of time. This is a change in direction for sure and it was a bit of a surprise. You can still hear that DT sound going on for the most part, however it does seem to be tamed down for this effort. I still think they need to check out their progressive roots a bit more and try and get away somewhat from the wanking.<br /><br />Progressive rock is truly a great breed of rock & roll as it showcases so much of the bands individual/members talents. However bands sometimes struggle to harness their technical ability and write riffage over substance. Dream Theater walks a fine line from time to time, but overall they are a band full of great musicians who kept the wanking to a minimum this time out. These guys are indeed a special breed!!but overall they are a band full of great musicians who kept the wanking to a minimum this time out. These guys are indeed a special breed!!
B000002KJQ|1.0|I LOATHE the remixed sound of this album. Here in Dallas, we have two stations that play this song. One plays the original version and when this new station came on, I heard what sounded like a studio modeled piece of crap from the 80's. Not until tonight when I read these reviews did I realize they did exactly that. Remixed it in the 80's... for heaven knows what reason.  <br /> <br />Get the original version in a secondhand store, for this one truly sucks.... It stinks that you can't get their arguably best album in it's original form. I'm really bummed out now.  <br /> <br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNTIL ZZ TOP REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE THEY MADE BY DOING THIS AND FIX THE PROBLEM!!!
B00029LNHS|1.0|This album is absolutely horrible.  Not only have the Black Eyed Peas always made mediocre music, but they picked up a minorly attractive female voice who is busty and can shake her ass.  They sacrificed their original sound and sold out to make some money in the pop music industry.  Suggestions for good recent rap albums:  The Game - The Documentary, Camron - Purple Haze, Kanye West - The College Dropout, Jay-Z - The Black Album, Blackalicious - Blazing Arrow
B00008EY9G|5.0|Well, I was bored and decided to rent some cheap horror movie for some laughs and so forth. But, then guess what happened. This movie rocked!!!!!!! The movie is about strangers that all gather at a motel because of a terrible storm. There's the newly weds, the beautiful prostitute (played by Gorgeous Amanda Peet!), a couple with a child but the wife is mortally wounded, a cop and his prisoner, an ex cop now limousine driver, a rich snob, and of course the owner of a motel. But, all of these characters have secrets and when one by one, they start getting murdered, something weird's going on. The ending is highly unpredictable with a great twist. This movie is one great suspense/ horror movie with some very freaky moments and the stellar cast includes John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. This horror movie is a must see.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|Where to start, where to start?  \\"Catwoman\\" is simply horrible, there is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching, not even Halle Berry.  The story is simple and too stupid to be put into any film, the characters are paper-thin, and the CGI effects work is the worst.  I watched the movie all the way through, hoping it would at some point become interesting, but it never does.  If for some reason you are still interested in what this movie is about then read the next paragraph, if all you want is to read about how bad it is, then skip the next paragraph and read on.    \\"Catwoman\\" of course is based on the character from DC Comics, she is a cat-burglar with an obsession for all things feline (hence the name).  Commonly used as a villain for Batman and at the same time a lover or sorts for Batman.  This movie pretty much ignores everything about Batman, and Catwoman's origins from the comics.  In fact, there are no references to Batman at all in this film.  The story goes like this, Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) works for a cosmetic firm, that is secretly making cosmetics that cause people to deteriorate and therefore, require more makeup from the same company.  Patience discovers this plot and is killed for her discovery, only to be resurrected by cats.  Now Patience has returned to life, but she's more cat-like than human, she likes kitty litter, sleeping on the roof, really stupid stuff that the director and writer probably thought would be cool in the movie but comes off laughable.  Patience eventually turns to crime and dons various costumes to become Catwoman before settling on the final costume which every guy that has seen a commercial or poster for this film knows very well.  It's the bikini top, with shredded leather pants, and a crappy looking mask.  For the most part the moment Halle dons this costume is the best part in the entire film, because this costume really shows off Halle's \\"assets\\", which is about the only redeeming quality in this film.  Once this happens of course we are led into the final showdown between Catwoman and the villain of the film (I don't remember her name, but she's played by Sharon Stone).  After the fight the movie ends and Catwoman is left roaming the streets hoping to get a sequel, but God-wiling that will never happen, and the audience runs out of the theater threatening to sue the director, who goes by the name \\"Pitof\\" for stealing 90 minutes of their life away.    The acting in this movie is simply terrible, one would think that Halle Berry being an Oscar winner would do a better job, but of course she didn't have much to work with here.  Really she shouldn't have even chosen to do this film, I mean to go from Oscar winner to this is terrible.  Sharon Stone, who for some reason is shown in this movie with what appears to be a soft glow around her, possibly to hide her wrinkles, is laughable as the villain.  Hopefully Sharon's return to her greatest character, Catherine Tremmel in \\"Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction\\" will be much better.  Benjamin Bratt as a cop chasing Catwoman and as Patience's love interest is worthless in this film.  The CGI work is beyond horrible, in this modern age of technology and with all of the great special effects used in movies, you would think they would have done a better job.  I mean, it was so obvious every time they used CGI in this film, it was even used for some of the scenes of Catwoman walking around.    Overall, a terrible movie with a beautiful lead actress that should have known better than to say yes to this picture.  I would not recommend watching this movie at all, not even if you are wanting to make fun of a movie, there are plenty of other bad movies that are still watchable that you can make fun of, this one is just not worth the jokes you could throw at it.    If for some reason, you do decide to watch this movie, here is the reason it is rated PG-13.    \\"Catwoman\\" is rated PG-13 for stylized violence, language, and sexuality.
0440238609|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy, and the books hold a very special place in my heart.  It's epic, fresh, dark, and completely marvelous.<br /><br />I got this boxed set as a gift a while back and I had never read it before, but hearing so many good things about it online, I took a chance and asked for them.  As I started on the first book, I must admit, I was slightly bored, waiting for something to happen, nothing really fitting together and making sense.  But as it went on, and I became familiar with Lyra's world; I really became hooked.  It is not as dark as I thought it would be, and although it isn't light and happy either it's certainly NOT your usual Tolkien-derived/-stolen fantasy, thank goodness.<br /><br />It has religious--or possibly even anti-religious, depending on how you look at it--elements, and I'm sure a lot of organized religionists (Christians, seeing as this is the religion most closely identifiable with the one in HDM) out there probably want these books burned, but to me--and lots of other lovers of HDM--this book IS spiritual, and it doesn't go against spirituality at all.  I see it as more going against using religion for the wrong purposes.  Whatever your stance, read this trilogy and judge it for yourself.<br /><br />Sure, it might be \\"for kids\\" but I can't see why it's for kids: it might be a little too dark than what they're able to handle.  I honestly feel that older readers get the most out of the series, or should I say, experience.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to summarize it; it is original, it is unique, it is moving, it is fantastic, it is simply beautiful.  All I can and must say is, \\"Read this book.  You will not be disappointed.\\"  And as I was, you might even be moved to look at things in life in a much different light.  I'm almost saddened that no one I know has ever heard of HDM...this is a trilogy that everyone should give a chance.
B00005JNJT|4.0|This movie is undoubtedly catered for matured audience who is looking more for depths and character developments.  It used to be that comic book movie offering defines clearly who the bad and good guys are; a lot of kicking arse going on but ultimately, justice shall prevail.  Subsequently, a new generation of directors started to rattle the cage, namely Ang Lee in the Hulk and now, Christopher Nolan in Batman Begins.  I find it quite a breath of fresh air by \\"deconstructing\\" parts of Batman.  This movie attempts to address the many why, who, where, when, how questions of Batman and I'm excited to report that the outcomes are rather logical but not corny and crass.  Some \\"old\\" villains are introduced such as Scarecrow.  New characters are introduced such as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend and later, love interest in the form of Katie Holmes, Raul, and Morgan Freeman's character akin to Q of James Bond franchise who introduced to Bruce Wayne many \\"toys\\" that grown-up men who are young at heart would droll all over.  Ultimately, the production is sleek by introducing new elements to freshen up the franchise and yet, not overdoing it to the extent that it sidelines the Batman fans of the past such as myself.  I guess it's true to say that this movie allows us to have a cake and eat it too.  Last but not least, a dry movie won't make do without some light-hearted jokes which are mainly done superbly by the veterans such as Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.  It's really wonderful to see Rutger Hauer back to the silver screen once again.  The casting for Batman Begins is impeccable with so many heavy weight actors.  Hans Zimmer soundtrack is as heroic and compelling as always.  Overall, a very well-done movie that keeps audience talking after the end credit rolls out.  I can't wait for the DVD limited edition release.  Moreoever, I look forward to watching the sequel which would most definitely bring back the most colourful villain of all, the Joker.  Gotham is always a part of the Batman myth and in this offering, the place is as bleak and as intimidating as always.  Long live the Batman franchise!  Highly recommended to be watched on the big screen.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This sure is one hell of a great thriller with action and great humor. Jamie Foxx gives an outstanding performance as Max, a cab driver living a normal life, until the wrong guy steps into his cab. When Vincent (played by Cruise)goes into his cab, Max doesn't realize that this guy's a nutcase and a hitman. He then forces Max to drive him to all of his targets but Max refuses to go down without a fight.. The movie is excellent with a highly original and awesome plot, loads of great action and suspense scenes, one awesome shootout at a nightclub, lots of great humor, and one scene where Vincent completely destroys some punks that steal his briefcase. Beleive me, write this one down on your must see list. It's got the perfect cast, and everything else I already said. I recommend buying it though as you'll definitely want to rewatch it and own this one.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I was extremely skeptical of this movie from the beginning. I couldn't believe that Warner Bros. was allowing the franchise to start over again and that it all came together so quickly (Quicker than Alien vs. Predator) I was expecting it to be another dumbed down version of the batman story (At the time I happened to think that Val Kilmer could have played a better Batman in the first two movies.) Now, I say without any hesitation that Christian Bales is by far the best Batman/Bruce Wayne so far adapted to film! there are a lot of differences in the story as far as how he became Batman and it makes the transition more human and less omnipitent(and even less egotistical). \\"My parents died so now I'm Batman.\\" *Yawn* What makes him so special? answer from \\"Batman Begins:\\" HE'S NOT!<br /><br />The origins are truly amazing and more believable in this 2nd attempt at a truly great story. I want so bad to point out how they took the perceptions about his origins from the \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Forever\\" films and destroyed it, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. (but believe me, I openly grinned when I realized what they had done!) I was glad to see some good actors in this movie too. Liam Neeson is great! (again, I REALLY want to go into detail, but I don't want to ruin it!) Michael Caine was ALWAYS the obvious choice for Alfred even back in 93. Katie Holmes has not always impressed me as the greatest actresses, but her acting in this movie has me coming around. (and shows her potential to become more) Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane is an EXCELLENT choice and just shows how the writers and Director wanted to have antagonists just as deep as the protaganist.<br /><br />I've seen almost every major movie to come out this year, and I must say that this one is the best one so far! (See my Episode 3 Review!)

B000002H2H|5.0|This record was my introduction to Metallica back in '84? Anyways, when I heard For Whom The Bells Toll (1st song I ever heard from them), I lost my freakin' mind. The heavy bell chime, then the ripping of the songs opening. CA RA ZEE! I was sitting in my dark bedroom, listening to a radio station that only played heavy music at night (Midnight to 3pm) and heard this song. I was hooked. After this album (not cd's), I purchased Kill 'Em All and started sweating when I experienced it. ESPECIALLY Anesthesia-Cliff done lost his damn mind! WHEW. I sweat through the whole set! Everyone knows Jimi was the best guitarist EVER! Cliff is the master of metal bass playing! Someone please challenge me? Just imagine him with that long neck bass, head bobbing as he plays intensely. Enough of Kill Em' All, Back to RTL. James' howl on every song, except Call of Ktulu, was piercing. And Kirk with his acned baby face and curly hair shredded the solos. And the Bjon Bork on drums. Lars did a great pounding on every song. Great cd! To those of you who have yet to purchase a Metallica, first off-What tha F**k! Get ur lazy ass up and buy this cd before I have to kill 'em all! Kidding (don't send any troops after me W & Rumsfeld)!

The book itself is HUGE and leather bound and is an exquisite coffee table book. I do have one slight problem with it however. It is full of Mates in 1, 2,or 3. - and these are great. I would have liked to have seen a section on \\"White to move and win\\" or \\"Black to move and win\\" - without knowing what it is that I the reader am looking for. This is more akin to a real chess game, where one knows there is a win somewhere, but is not sure what kind to look for.

B00025ETIW|4.0|The first song I heard by My Chemical Romance was \\"I'm Not Okay\\". Personally, I found the song to be quite annoying. Since I didn't like that song I didn't really have any interest to look into MCR.  <br /> <br />Well my sister bought the album and I decided to have a listen and check out the other tracks. Wow. I actually love it. A LOT. Each track sounds unique and overall MCR has their own unique sound and I enjoy it. My favorite tracks are \\"Cemetery Drive\\", \\"Helena\\" & \\"To The End\\". Overall great CD and definetly worth listening to!
B00000AF95|5.0|By the time the early 1980's had arrived,the hair metal era had begun,and even though Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were no longer members of the KISS family,Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley had managed to carry on and remain succesful-and it was their \\"Lick It Up\\" album that did just that for them. And now,after Simmons and Stanley were grateful to have remained successful after they had taken off their make-up and costumes,they released another record in 1984 that also found the four demons of rock performing without theit make-up and costumes-and that album was \\"Animalize\\". How did this album turn out? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This album,while it may not be \\"Destroyer\\" or \\"Love Gun\\",is,in my opinion,one of the best CDS of the 80's,and one of the best hair metal records also. It is my favorite KISS album that was released when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were no longer with the band and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley had taken off their make-up. Even though KISS had seen a lot of success with \\"Lick It Up\\",there were two problems that faced them(mostly Paul Stanley this time). The first problem was that Vinnie Vincent,the guitarist who had first replaced Ace Frehley and had performed on \\"Lick It Up\\",had acted up on tour,which resulted in Vinnie getting fired-and that meant that Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley would have to recruit another guitarist. The second problem was at the time,Gene Simmons was off in Canada filming the sciecne fiction film \\"Runaway\\" with Tom Selleck as his co-star and Michael Crichton acting as director,so he missed out on a large half of this record. But that didn't mean that everything wouldn't turn out good. As a matter of fact,it turned out great. The guitarist on this record was Mark St. John,and while St. John was not as talented as Ace Frehley,Eddie Van Halen,or Slash,was still a pretty good guitarist. The opening track on this album is \\"I've Had Enough(Into The Fire\\")which is a really smart way to open an album-the guitaron it sounds really good,and the lyrics sing about what usually guys and girls get tired of a relationship-being ignored and abandoned. Paul Stanley and Desmond Child did a really good job at crafting this song-and the best part is that it does not even come close to sounding like a corny song penned by someone like The Backstreet Boys,John Travolta,Avril Lavigne,etc.Everything else here sounds really good-\\"Thrills In The Night\\" is a song that comes off as really good and maybe even a little bit \\"innocent\\" when it is about a girl who is good during the day but is \\"bad\\" during the nighttime.As for the songs that Gene Simmons contributed to this record(Burn B***h Burn,Lonely Is The Hunter,While The City Sleeps,and Murder In High Heels)are all really good,typical Gene Simmons songs. And don't forget \\"Heaven's On Fire\\",the big hit off of this album-it has hair metal written all over it,and it reminds me of both Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" song and Warrant's \\"classic\\" \\"Cherry Pie\\" tune. KISS sure did think about girls-and this song proved just that. <br /> <br />An awesome record that should be heard by all KISS fans and all fans of 80's hair metal.
B000068QY7|3.0|2002's \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" was an anticipated release for all Oasis fans as it heralded a new era with Gem Archer and Andy Bell in the band for the first album recorded with the new line up, also the last album to feature Alan White on drums. In terms of comparisons to all other Oasis albums this one gets a 3 star as it can't stand shoulder to shoulder (no pun intended) with Oasis' greater albums. But don't let that dissuade you, this album (when released) was my 3rd favourite out of the 5 released at the time, it ran a close 2nd but was always pipped by \\"Definitely Maybe\\".  <br /> <br />So what makes this album tick? Funnily enough it is Liam Gallaghers songs that really add the heart and strength to it, Noel penned 2 classics, but the rest he wrote are easily swept away by Liams 3 songs and Gems \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\". This album showcased Liam Gallagher as a great songwriter and poses the question \\"Did he get any help?\\", the answer is probably not in terms of the actual songs, more the arrangements and production (which is credited to \\"The Band\\"... not the 60's group of the same name but Oasis themselves). <br /> <br />Strong songs? <br />On \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" there are 3 varieties of song: <br />1. Amazing songs. <br />2. Strong songs. <br />3. Forgettable songs. <br /> <br />Let's deal with the amazing songs, \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is the first amazing song on this album, very moving and is a crowd favourite at Oasis live shows. Noel even says the title is ironic in the fact that whenever it's played live there are always people crying. This is easily one of Noels greatest songs committed to tape, and the acoustic demo is just as powerful. <br /> <br />\\"Songbird\\", the albums best song by a full mile and a half!!!! This is a Liam song and what amazes most is just how good it actually is. Delicate, beautiful, sweet are all words you would find hard to associate with something Liam Gallagher the loudmouth, arrogant frontman would write... but this is just what I said. A gorgeous 2 minutes of true beauty, where Liam pulled this one from is beyond my comprehension. <br /> <br />Sadly I feel that is the end of the amazing songs. Only 2 on this album, but they alone are worth it. Now we move onto the strong songs. As I mentioned before \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\" is a Gem song and truly a balls to the wall rocker that was used on a Victorias Secret commercial in the USA (oh the irony), it's just a strong song like \\"Supersonic\\" or \\"Rock N Roll Star\\" were. Such a fast paced loud and great song you'll want loud whenever it comes on. Great bass fill by Mr. Bell and a cool guitar solo too. <br />    The next strong song is the Noel penned \\"Little By Little\\", which is frustrating in the fact that it borders between strong song and amazing song, it just doesn't have that final nudge to take it into amazing. Originally written and demoed the same time as \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" it was kept back for this album, with an intention in mind. To make this album just that more stronger!! Another live favourite and to many fans a classic. I can see why. As \\"Little By Little\\" borders amazing then the next Noel penned song borders forgettable but is more secure in the strong song bracket, \\"She Is Love\\" is simply a love song for Noels girlfriend, suprisingly happy and has a summery feel to it. Not much to say about this one though. <br /> <br />\\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" has to be called the epic of the album, Liams song dedicated to his son (Lennon) has such a dark edge to it and sounds very unlike Oasis with it's atmospheric sounds and lyrics. There are moment where it gets Beatlesque but still it grows and swells like a collosus. Easily the stand-out song on the album, just because of it's sheer weight and sound... and again a Liam song that stands out for a reason not negative. The final song in the strong song category is Liams \\"Better Man\\" which is just a rocker with a shuffle. That makes it sound like a forgettable one but itisn't that, whereas the previous album had bad rockers like \\"I Can See A Liar\\" this one is much better and stands above this albums forgettable ones with strength. <br /> <br />That leaves \\"Force Of Nature\\" a song written in 1999 and released on a British movie soundtrack the same year, when you think about what it's about you can't help raise a smile as Noel sings the lines \\"You look like a faded picture, I see the cracks freezing on your skin\\". Andy Bells \\"A Quick Peep\\" is a good little number, but it clocks in at around 1:30 and is too short to go anywhere. \\"(Probably) All In The Mind\\"... the worst song on the album, with one of the best guitar solos on the album (played by Johnny Marr). The final forgettable number is the #1 single \\"The Hindu Times\\" it's good, but is it THAT good? No. It's one of those you put on before you go out on the town and leave it at that. <br /> <br />Now that \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" has been released this album has slipped a little more down the ratings chart, so it recieves 3 stars. But it marks a turning point in the Oasis sound, they stopped dead in the tracks of \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" and took 3 steps backwards to the old Oasis sound. Then went 20 steps to the left and recorded \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\", makes me appreciate this album even more to know they didn't pursue to interesting sound of \\"Standing...\\" and \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" was key in creating the masterpiece \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\"..... BELIEVE!!!!

It is truly a dark reflection of her own dwelling!<br /><br />This is a superb evocation of nightmarish fantasy, easily read in a single sitting, and equally capable of keeping you up all night.<br /><br />Relic113
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I have to say that I was left utterly inimpressed and totally uninspired by this latest version of the \\"Phantom\\". <br /> <br />Let me be specific. <br />I loved the cinematography....the producers did an absolutely splendid job with that. <br />From beginning to end, this film is a visual master piece and much of my 3 star rating is based upon this premise. <br /> <br />Other than this, there was really nothing too great about this film. <br />Seeing as this is a musical, I was actually quite disappointed by the bland and downright insipid singers chosen to star in this film. <br /> <br />First the female lead role of Christine: <br />I admit that the young lady that was cast in the lead role had a pleasent enough voice for this sort of music, but, contrary to popular opinion, I was not overly impressed with her voice. <br />I found her acting more involved and, frankly, better than her singing. <br /> <br />The Phantom: <br />This guy should restrict his singing to the local karaoke bars! From his tone, to his lack of musicality, his is easily the worst voice I've ever heard in a lead role of ANY play, musical or opera. <br />Here again I've found the acting to be stronger than the singing...in this case the acting was exponentially more impressive as the singig was really just two steps from torrid. <br />Again, the general populous was very taken by this guy based on his LOOKS!  <br />And that's the real problem here, they've chosen an attrative actor, who CAN NOT sing, to play the part of what is supposed to be a hiddeous phantom who CAN sing. The result being a handsome phantom with a hiddeous voice!!!! Way to go casting directors. <br /> <br />The Vice Count: <br />Well, here's another actor ill-chosen for the part he is to portray. <br />For one, he looks more like a complete sissy whimp then the strong, heroic savior and lover of Christine. <br />The guy has zero masculinity...visually nor vocally. <br />He not only looks like a whimp, but is tenor voice isa weak and small one of no particular destinction whatsoever. <br />Nothing like having to watch a whimpy, feminine looking guy with a small, non-descript voice cast in a part that is supposed to go to a heroic figure. That's akin to casting Johnny Depp (though a great actor) in the part of the Termintor or XXX. It just doesn't work! <br />However; I'm not surpised as Hollywood no longer seems to be interested in manly looking actors, rather opting for boyish, weak and fem looking whimps.  <br /> <br />The rest of the cast was ok. Again, nothing stood out as particularily great. <br /> <br />One of my biggest issues with this production is that they have altered the score and thus, removed the OPERA part from the equation. <br />Traditionally, the operatic sequences in the \\"Phantom\\" are from FAUST or some other actual operatic work. <br />Here; however, they've substituted an Opera for some fictional \\"opera\\", in english and all. <br />How terribly bland and insipid the overall result. <br />The exclusion of any real operatic sequences really hurt the overall, musical flair of the film. <br /> <br />Overall, this film is decent and were it not for the fact that that the voices of the cast are so weak, it would have been incontrivertibly better. <br /> <br />I've only watched this film once, as the monotony and banality of it all was such that I had no desire to watch it again.  <br />Serious musical or opera lovers beware...this is a lightweight Hollywood fare from beginning to end. <br /> <br />
0780628551|1.0|There is a simple equation in Hollywood. Great actors= great film right? In the case of this horrendous take on the alien movies, it combines things from every alien plot you can think of and blends it with a not-so-original storyline and an all-star cast (which at the time probably didn't seem to shabby). The movie takes you through a long, boring, kiddie coaster ride, that starts slow, rides slow, and ends slow. Not impressive at all. THe movie ends, and you realize that you just wasted your last 10 bucks. The movie fails to please as a sci-fi thriller, and gives extra-terrestrials a bad name!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have been a Foo Fighters fan since their debut album, and I continue to be impressed with their work.  I really like their new album.  I can't find any tracks in need of skipping.  My favorites are 'In Your Honor', 'No Way Back', 'DOA' and 'The Last Song'.  I'm especially impressed with the drummer, Taylor Hawkins.  I've liked his work since he joined the band, but he really seems to kick it up a notch in this outing.  He's really ripping rapid-fire on those drum sets.  Very tight.  And as always, Dave Grohl is the perfect frontman.  Excellent vocals, very emotionally charged, especially when he's screaming the lyrics.  I can almost feel him reaching through the speakers to grab my shirt, shake me around and say \\"Listen to this!  I'm baring my soul!\\"  Excellent disc 1 and a nice change of pace on the acoustic disc 2.  My favorite track from disc 2 is the last one, 'Razor'.  This is an excellent release, all around.  Highly recommended.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Closer is brutal. It is a horrible little movie with its dirty sequences and inapproprapriate dialouge...however this is an adult movie with adult situations, scenarios, characters and substance. The cast is fabulous. Clive Owen and almost unknown character except for his turns in Courier and Gosford Park, is excellent as the perverted male character, Julia Roberts is wooden but slightly convincing women, Judeaw is the man whos torn between two trelationships and gorgeous Natalie Portman is beautiful as the young call girl with a heart. She is a stripper yet never comes off slutty or cheap yet is always convincing. I dont think you can say you like thois movie because it is full on..but you will appreciate its real characters, situations and substance. Send your kids to Christmas at the cranks (well actually why make them suffer?) and take your partner to this film that highlights the rules of dating..all of course thrown out the window!! if your not convinced to see it..well check it out and tell me that the hilarious 'internet dating' scenario is not funny, and that natalie Portman isnt beautiful anfd i will give ypou a million bucks..well actually i wont but you can guarantee that im right. 3 stars from me..not brilliant, not crap just real and for that reason it is definitely worth checking out!!!!!! go Natalie, Go natalie, go natalie!!!! also if u love this check out Garden State another piece of cinematic brilliance:)
B00006RU5B|4.0|In search of the soundtrack to the film, \\"Collateral\\" I opted to snatch up this disc as well. Both contain the track, \\"Shadow on the Sun\\", a haunting song familiar in that I've heard it before in a dream.  <br />When Audioslave first debuted back in 2002 I ignored thier album, but was happy to see familiar faces joining force to forge something new. Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine were staples of my budding adolescence back in the early-to-late nineties when music was raw and not quite so polished and contrived as the mainstream junk we are peddled today. \\"Like a Stone\\" peaked my interest when it was released, but not enough for me to embrace this band. There were too many memories connected with the previous respective projects of the 90s rock era and I was fearful of skewing. <br />It was not until hearing the wail of Cornell, his voice utterly distinctive among every singer in rock PERIOD, on \\"Shadow\\" that I decided to pursue Audioslave's debut.  <br />I am pleased to say that my emotions connected with a better time in music are now enhanced by the sounds on this album. I have already purchased their new album, \\"Be Yourself\\" and have proclaimed Audioslave to be one of the most important rock acts we have today. 'Nuff said.
B00003CXXI|4.0|Mike Myers is Shrek, an Ogre who finds he has a heart of gold. Happy just to bathe in the mud all day and dine alone by candle light (the candles are made with his very own ear wax), wants nothing more than to be left alone in peace. (He scares the occasional intruder without harming a fly) The peaceful existence is shattered when Shrek's swamp becomes overrun with refugee fairy-tale characters seeking asylum from the wicked Lord Farquad (voiced by John Lithgow). Living puppets, gingerbread men, dwarves, fairies and the odd talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) - all flee from Farquaad's onslaught to make his realm a perfect kingdom. Not caring much for Shrek's peace, Farquaad has his own ambitions. To become king, he needs to marry a princess. With the help of a magic mirror, Farquaad rashly settles on the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a lone waif trapped in the high tower of a palace besieged by a fearsome dragon and surrounded by a mote of fire. Shrek strikes a deal with the would-be king - Fiona for the return of his swamp. With the help of the talking Donkey, Shrek saves the princess and they set for Farquaad's kingdom of Du Loc, sharing some adventures along the way, but managing not to learn that the princess has some secrets of her own.  <br /> <br />Shrek has a simple story, with a simple message - inner beauty counts - which clashes with the sumptuous animation but also with the ludicrous appearance of the villainous Farquaad. That said, this is a great flick because of the talent - Mike Myers does Shrek with his trademark Scotsman shtick, while Eddie Murphy invents a whole new facet as the annoying sidekick who never knows when to leave. The flick pokes fun at fairy tales (a page of which is consigned early in the flick as toilet paper; instead of waking the sleeping Fiona with a kiss, Shrek just shakes her violently awake), but also at Disney - the kingdom of Du Loc bares a facial resemblance to Disneyworld, complete with gift shops and, my favorite bit, an automated info booth obviously patterned on \\"It's a Small World\\". Shrek is a fairy tale, good for kids (who may miss most of the references) but aimed at grown-ups sick of the treacly sentiment of animated features from that...other company. As always, this is the VCR review, so I'm not vouching for DVD extras.
0385335482|5.0|This is the first in the \\"shopaholic\\" series that I have read and I'm hooked. It was such a crazy and fun tale about Rebecca buying and shopping like noone's business that I could not put the book down. I want to read the whole line of shopaholic books now! <br /> <br />If you are a seriel shopper or try to be one, read this book. It will make you laugh and has many true to life moments. You will love it!
B0007XT87G|5.0|Take a word of advice from a long-time heavy metal fan - and when I say heavy, I mean Opeth, SYL, Cephalic Carnage, Acid Bath, you get the picture! - buy this album and In Absentia and let their dark beauty and brilliance seep into your soul.  Really, in many ways, it just doesnt get much heavier than this..or much better!  5 stars for this and In Absentia!!
0446677450|3.0|This book successfully motivates the reader to challenge his/her ingrained ideas about money.  I enjoyed the twists that the rich dad gives to the poor dad's familiar quotes, e.g., \\"I will never be rich because I have you kids\\" vs. \\"Because I have you kids, I must be rich.\\" <br /> <br />The author drives home that people should attempt to accumulate assets and minimize expenses and liabilities, which should be obvious, but obviously many people don't do do this.  One contribution of the book is to help us rethink which items are actually assets and which are liabilities.  In light of this, it is suggested that a person build wealth before buying \\"luxuries\\" (read: liabilities), instead of the other way around.  Again, a great concept. <br /> <br />But when the author goes into more specific examples of real estate \\"deals\\" that he has made and forming corporations to use pre-tax dollars to purchase the \\"luxuries,\\" it seems as though some of these ideas are legally and morally questionable.  And, as another reviewer points out, investing in stocks and mutual funds is initially said to be a good way to accumulate assets, but the author later practically dismisses these investments unless you are very young or don't like risk.   <br /> <br />I would second the idea of borrowing the book or reading the first chapter or so in your favorite bookstore.  This is where the bulk of the general ideas are presented, although you may be able to squeeze out a few more by reading the entire book.
0596007124|4.0|At last I have finished reading Head First Design Patterns book. Below is my review of the book and why people in Java/J2EE or say Object Orient (domain) world should buy this as it's worth your money. <br /> <br />This book Covers 13-14 Patterns in quite detail as listed blow with good real life examples. <br />Patterns Covered - <br />Strategy, Observer,Decorating Objects, Factory Method, Singleton, Command Pattern, Adapter, Facade, <br />Template Method, Iterator, Composite, State, Proxy, Compound. <br /> <br />And some others in appendix like Bridge, Builder, Prototype, Mentor. <br /> <br />What is interesting about this book is its approach. When you start reading it doesn't feel in a way you are reading a technical book as it encourages more of interactions with the reader by asking question or having discussions with you or team members working on a scenario where the pattern will be used. For example it uses phrase \\"There are no dumb questions\\" to reply to doubts or questions you will come across with scenarios. Also covers step by step with Class diagrams and code snippets to stage until the pattern is defined with its pros and cons and then comparing wit other patterns if they come across similar to others. Also has cross word puzzle to test your brain, which is always handy along with scenario's to fill in once pattern is understood. Has lots of diagrams having flow of events in a scenario which really makes it easy to grasp it. <br /> <br />The most striking thing about this book is that how it is presented, because having knowledge in a domain is different from how you impart or present that knowledge to others and this is where this book fills this gap, which technical books seems to miss mostly. Also if you are using Java/J2EE for quite a while I will say, read this book as u might be learning more. But this is not the bible of patterns book, but seems to be more then sufficient if you want to start your journey in in this doamin. This book deserves to be on my bookshelf. <br /> <br />For more on this can be read on my blog &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Book Review - Head First Design Patterns&lt;/a>
B00005YU1O|1.0|The \\"animation\\", which involves rotoscoping live action, is so jittery that it hurt my eyes. This movie stinks.
B000026OHN|5.0|This version is outstanding.  <br />No other one even compares to this one. <br />You might say....Glenn Gould???? No, he plays making stacattos. <br />Andras Schiff???--he plays too slow. <br />As a pianist, I prefer Richter above all others. He plays exactly what you want to hear. So perfect. <br />Only two things that aren't good: ADD format. The Bsendorfer in which he plays is a little bit tuned up. <br /> <br />Don't look for other versions, you've found the correct one.
B000002TPS|5.0|I'll admit.  When I first listened to this album, I liked only 3 songs.  I thought the rest of was just stupid depressing commercial crap.  After about a year, I gave another listen all the way thru one day, and well, I was amazed.  Definitely the most emotional Megadeth record, as this was made after Dave Mustaine had died and was then revitalized shortly after. <br /> <br />1. Reckoning Day: Good solid rocker, good solid opener, I personally really like this song because it is a really really good song for people to listen to who think Megadeth is just all about death and stuff. <br />Rating: A- <br /> <br />2. Train of Consequences: Probably my favorite song on the cd. Starting from the catchy opening riff, to the emotional chorus, and to in my opinion one of Marty Friedman's best solos ever!  A nearly perfect song. <br />Rating: A+ <br /> <br />3. Addicted to Chaos: The saddest verse of any song I have ever heard.  But it shows the song is a story, beginning from despair (the intro and verses) to making a comeback and not giving in as shown by the choruses in the outro.   <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />4. A Tout Le Monde: What could have been the hit single from the cd had MTV not banned the video due to the song being about suicide.  Definitely Megadeth's most emotional song, and it can be really moving at times. <br />Rating: B+ <br /> <br />5. Elysian Fields: Just a weird song with some kinda \\"end-of-the-world\\" vibe to it.  Really really catchy chorus though, but no guitar solo :( <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />6. The Killing Road: Ah, old school Megadeth style here.  Killer riff and an absolute shred-fest guitar solo from Marty Friedman (and then another cool solo by Dave after that).  Not to be missed. <br />Rating: B+ <br /> <br />7. Blood Of Heroes: Another cool song with some cool riffs and catchy parts all the way around.  A good rocker and sounds a bit different from the rest of the songs on here. <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />8. Family Tree: Second best song on the cd, featuring the super-catchy intro and then into a very emotional song, however unfortuantely about incest.  The lyrics however cannot prevent a masterfully written song from getting an A by me though. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />9. Youthanasia: This song really bores me until it picks up mid-way thru, or basically to the super-cool bridge and then to a really sweet solo spot.  The solos arent to be missed, but the rest of the song kinda is. <br />Rating: C+ <br /> <br />10. I Thought I Knew It All: These three songs, Youthanasia, I Thought I Knew It All, and Black Curtains all bore me very much.  There is nothing outstanding or different on this song except the chorus, very good lead part during the chorus. <br />Rating: C+ <br /> <br />11. Black Curtains: Eeek, the verse is cool for a while but the rest of the song is sheer boredom.  One I tend to skip often. <br />Rating: C <br /> <br />12. Victory: Now this is where its at, and a great song to close the album.  Fun lyrics but nothing amazing, and the whole song is just a very high-quality commercial song with some AMAZING guitar solos by Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman. <br />Rating: A
B00005JMR5|4.0|Taylor Hackford took the premise of juxtaposing two premiere dancers and their two differing styles and made a taut little melodrama that explores the theme of freedom of expression in art, relationships and politics. Is ballet more free than tap?  Does Hines have an 'open' marriage with Isabella Rosselini in the film? And what about those Soviets, and the funders for dance companies in the west, controlling who does what? But to return to reality, freedom could also apply to the wonderfully fluid camera used to record the dance sequences. <br />Enjoy the view of Roland Petit's \\"Le Jeune Homme et La Morte\\" and Baryshnikov's famous \\"pas de deux with a chair\\" (finally captured on film)as an almost participant, and the two self-choreographed studio sequences of Baryshnikov and Hines with a camera that moves as quickly over, below, and above the dancers as the dancers themselves.  Having seen Baryshnikov live several times (once with the Kirov, then ABT, and from backstage wings once or twice), I had no problem guessing the outcome of that ruble/pirouette bet.  So glory in the dance sequences and the views of two masters at work, and an enterprising and creative director with a political heart. (Who later did a similar romantic triangle in politicized setting with \\"Proof of Life\\".) <br /> <br />RE ACTING: Since Baryshnikov was playing elements of his past, it was not too big a stretch.  (He scared his young daughter, Alexandra, when she viewed the airplane crash scene.)  But the sequence where he visited the dance school and they had no idea who he was because the Soviets tried to make sure newer generations forgot, was a real worry at the time.  Luckily, Baryshnikov's artistry lives on in several films/tapes so younger generations can see what the legend is all about.  How many past performers/performances miss out that chance at a posterity other than words.  Live is nice, but capture the great at least once on film/tape for future generations please. <br /> <br />Hines and the supporting cast had all acted much before, and again had no problem.  Interesting comment about the foreign accents, Smolinowski is Polish I believe, and Helen Mirren (though of Russian extraction and able to speak the language) is English--and later the wife of director Hackford. <br /> <br />LOCATION: Portugal subbed for inside the Marynski Theatre. Finland for Hines' russian hometown and some exteriors. And stock footage of course for St. Petersburg.  Wonderful editing with that on the drives through the city, and of course, in the dance sequences. <br />Overall, smile at the plot, and enjoy the dance. <br />
B00005JNJT|2.0|Batman Begins is not a good film as many would have you believe. <br /> <br />Perhaps on a superficial level you will be charmed by the attractive cast, the gritty sets/ scenes, and the new batman suit and mobile.  And to a degree the story is anchored on the question of Vengeance and Justice, which provides a measure of depth.  But do they all mesh?  Moreover, does it make a good action movie? <br /> <br />It could have.  This movie did not.  There are many reasons that I did not feel any empathy for this movie, but I will name just three. <br /> <br />First, I just could not buy the whole idea of Conclave of Shadows - or whatever they called themselves.  A group of shinobi types 'balancing out' civilizations for thousands of years... it just did not seem pluasible.  It may be cliche, but it still seems more plausible that a villain would rather be what he is for the usual reasons: personal desires, ambitions, goals.  The idea of an ancient and secret order bent on global justice seems so way out there that I bet most people don't even care about them at all thruout the movie.  And when the archvillain goes out with a bang, the movie quickly cuts to the next and last scene, as if itself did not care about the fate of the Conclace after that last explosion. <br /> <br />Second, there is an issue of plausibility.  It seemed to me that all the natives Bruce encounters in his warderings across the desolatation of Tibet seem to speak and understand American. And when Bruce Wayne finally climbs up to the very asian looking Temple to meet the Conclave, he finds it occupied by a bunch of white guys with bad ninja costumes?  Ok, there was Ken Watanabe, but he is nothing more than window dressing in the Temple sequence.  Some may call it a small gripe, but if you want to borrow the asian mystique to justify Batman's scrappy aura, the movie could and should have delievered better. <br /> <br />Finally, I hated the action sequences.  Batman Begins' idea of action is to stick the camera as close to the action as possible, than shake it very fast left and right to simulate intensity.  Is this the best way to handle action in a multimillion dollar movie?  They couldn't hire one piano wire guy, much less a legitimate action choreographer?  I read somewhere that the director of this movie has Memento and Imsomnia on his resume.  Those were two good movies, but niether of them are action - and it shows in Batman Begins.  When I pay to watch an action flick, I want action, damnit! <br /> <br />On the whole, I found Batman Begins very boring and badly plotted.  All the pieces were there, but I think they could have been assembled into a much better movie.
B000002B7O|4.0|I personally think that any person trying to get into Ozzy Osbourne should pick either this or Blizzard Of Ozz up, as they represent the two best Ozzy albums and the ones that represent him the best.  This remaster is good to go, but avoid the one that shows the full cover without the big \\"Ozzy\\" letters, as it is a horrid remaster.  Now for the songs... <br /> <br />1. Over The Mountain: A solid opener, good melody and some really cool guitar parts.  May not be my favorite song on here but still a solid one. <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />2. Flying High Again: Now this song is just genious.  Very commercial sounding but yet it still retains all \\"Ozzy-ness\\" of the rest of the tracks.  Very very catchy with a sweet guitar solo and an overall fun song. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />3. You Can't Kill Rock and Roll: Some parts of this song I really like, and some other parts I don't like quite as much.  All the clean parts of the song (intro, verse, pre-chorus) are very solid but for some reason the rest of the song kinda bores me. <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />4. Believer: This song is great, an all-around excellent metal song.  Sweet main riff, great verse, and not to mention a killer bridge.  My one problem with this song is that the guitar solo sounds very very reminescent of Mr. Crowley... <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />5. Little Dolls: Definitely my least favorite song on here.  For some reason this song just bores me, there is no part of the song that stands out at all. <br />Rating: C+ <br /> <br />6. Tonight: A very very good ballad by Ozzy featuring some AMAZING guitar work from Randy Rhoads.  The main solo is awesome, but just wait til the outro solo for sheer awesomeness. Oh yea, the rest of the song is great too. <br />Rating: A- <br /> <br />7. S.A.T.O: Faster paced NWOBHM rocker with a very very sweet main riff and a cool guitar solo added to it.  Nothing wrong at all with this one. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />8. Diary Of A Madman: Defnitely the most creepy andpsycho I have heard, from the intro to the very end it is just a very weird song, and the title fits it perfectly.  The great usage of notes for the eerie feel, and Ozzy's melodies help as well. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />Pick up this and Blizzard of Ozz, both great ways to give listeners a good taste of Ozzy Osbourne.
B000077VR3|4.0|Set in the late 1890s this is the tale of a young poet called Christian (Ewan McGregor) who travels to Paris to make his fortune in the Moulin Rouge. He meets with the alcohol addicted Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) who introduces Christian to a seedy underground world full of drugs, sex and musical theatre. The innocent Christian is thrown into a passionate but doomed affair with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star of the show...<br /><br />Based on the songs featured in this dazzling, inventive musical/romance alone, (Lady Marmalade? Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend? Smells Like Teen Spirit?) you would never know this film is set in the 19th century. But the fact the film has scant regard for reality, using some of the most famous songs of the last 50 years or so in the wrong time, really doesnt matter. Only in the hands of Baz Luhrman could such a thing like this be done, yet you never question it.<br /><br />The costumes, set design and especially music are all fantastic, the film has a wonderful sense of zip and energy bringing to mind the best West End show you've ever seen. Check out the scene where a whole medley of songs are sung, it seems -  (including a showstopping turn of Elton John's classic Your Song) blended seamlessly together. Ewan McGregor does have a very good voice. In fact both leads do.<br /><br />Theres also the clever \\"story within the story\\" technique - the \\"penniless sitar player\\" character in the play McGregor is writing being an obvious metaphor for his own character in the film, and the jealous Duke (Richard Roxburgh, who is also in love with Satine) is obviously the model for the rich, cruel \\"Maharaja\\" in the play.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the film doesnt lose anything by being told in a kind of \\"flashback\\" either, and having the \\"outcome\\" of the film being explained at the beginning as I thought it would. It adds to the romantic element of the story, in fact.<br /><br />Overall, a hugely enjoyable film.
B000089RV6|5.0|This is just great. My personal favorite AC/DC album. There isn't one bad song on here.
B000002KKC|4.0|Tusk is similar to the Beatles' White Album in many respects. They're both double albums that were released after the bands had found massive success and were at their creative peak, but at the same time, starting to come apart. They also both have three different band members writing songs, and singing lead. While a couple of the songs on Tusk were big hits in 1979 (\\"Tusk\\" and \\"Sara\\"), Tusk didn't sell as much as the White Album, and is not even on the Rolling Stone magazine Top 500 Albums-of-All-Time list.<br /><br />While I am inclined to rate it 5 stars on the basis of the talents involved, I think it had too few Stevie Nicks songs, and it seems as though Buckingham used the same chord patterns and rhythms for a couple of his songs.<br /><br />The songs-<br />\\"Not That Funny\\" - a good concert opener with some rhythmic guitar,<br />\\"Honey Hi\\" - McVie's best track on this album, laidback with congas and Nicks on background vocals,<br />\\"Sara\\" - the main Stevie Nicks hit, still a great listen,<br />\\"Walk A Thin Line\\" - a slow-paced Buckingham song with a heavy drum beat,<br />\\"Sisters of the Moon\\" - a Nicks song similar in sound to Rumours,<br />\\"Over and Over\\" - one of McVie's better soft rock tunes,<br />\\"Angel\\" - a mid-tempo Nicks song with keyboard,<br />\\"Save Me A Place\\" - slow with some good vocal harmonies,<br />\\"Beautiful Child\\" - a Nicks ballad,<br />\\"That's Enough For Me\\" -  fast with some blues in the guitar solo,<br />\\"Storms\\" - another Nicks ballad, the most emotional song here,<br />\\"Tusk\\" - the concert finale/closer, a favorite of marching bands across the States in the early 80s.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The only reason people keep writing 1 star reviews is because \\"X&Y\\" has been #1 on the Billboard 200 Album's chart for 2 weeks and might possibly be for a third. This alum is a masterpiece. That's why people keep buying it. Rock music doesn't usually sound like this. Coldplay makes it bold and adventurous. This is Coldplay's best and also the best album of 2005.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This is the best Foo albulm yet.  It may not contain the best song but overall it is the best.  With hearing it over 20 times so far I still have not yet put on the second disc.  I don't care yet.  It doesn't matter what the dual disc costs...the first disc is priceless.  Think of a mix of Nirvana and Sunny Day.  It's not as cheery as the past, it seems like Dave has grown back, with a little help from Sunny Day.  100% the best!!  Look for a better albulm this year...I dare you!
B0006L16N8|4.0|As for comments regarding Coldplay's \\"Radiohead\\" progression on this record, listen to the vocals from the 2nd versus on of both \\"Low\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\"...Also listen to the guitars on the change up towards the end of \\"Low\\"...And the chord changes and guitars on during \\"Twisted Logic\\".  It may take several listens but then you'll get it.  Of the three Coldplay CD's, this record takes the most patience to eventually appreciate...Overall, an excellent CD.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is the best Foo albulm yet.  It may not contain the best song but overall it is the best.  With hearing it over 20 times so far I still have not yet put on the second disc.  I don't care yet.  It doesn't matter what the dual disc costs...the first disc is priceless.  Think of a mix of Nirvana and Sunny Day.  It's not as cheery as the past, it seems like Dave has grown back, with a little help from Sunny Day.  100% the best!!  Look for a better albulm this year...I dare you!
B00006879E|2.0|Perhaps i am slanted in favor of heavy music.  I love hard bass, powerful chords and darker lyrics.  And i admit to being occasionally snobish about that fact.  As is i am making an effort to accept music of a more... \\"funky\\" variety.  This CD, however, i cannot come to enjoy, regardless of how many have touted it as being \\"funky\\" and \\"cool\\". <br /> <br />The first song is deceptively catchy.  I will give them credit (and a whole star) for track 1.  It has a solid melody and beat, and a \\"funk\\" feeling, while retaining some harder punk edge (no doubt an inspiration for this album in some capacity).  However, from that point on it comes closer to background music, with simple and none too interesting lyrics and vocals.  The vocals themselves occasionally break out of this background (and occasionally almost calming) sound, and not in a good way.  If Billy Corgan caused potential listeners to shy away from the smashing pumpkins, then the vocalist for maroon 5 is doing the same to me.   <br /> <br />This album is a good effort, and it's apparent that the songs were given thought and not made from off the shelf parts (buy some emo lyrics, learn some chords, get some hair gel and HEY its [insert your most hated pop-punk band here]).  For that i give them as much credit as i can...
B0007XT7V8|1.0|Whoops, I just wasted 13 bucks.  These guys suck!  Maybe one of the worst records I have heard in a long time.  Think Lit with some back country.  If you like the single, that's all you'll like.  Don't waste your money...you'll soon forget about them. <br />
B000286RNY|4.0|I thought this was gonnah be serious monks playing soccer or something, but it turned out it is a movie using the idea. A soccer star in the 80's has become a bum and he finds out his X teammate who is coaching the #1 team now was behind it all... he eventualy gets people trained in Kung-Fu to be his team to take to a tournament, with some persasian and practice they use there martial arts training and incorporate it into the game of soccer to compete for a million dollar prize, a long the way is side storys of love, respect, honor and goofy comedy.    The acting is way over the top, but it's not unbareabull, it's supposed to be over the top and fun.. the CGI effects are over the top aswell, but it adds to the comedy.    Overall it's quite a suprising family film, you dont have to be into martial arts to enjoy this film, and you dont have to like soccer either... it's just all in good fun and worthy of a rental for a familly night in.... it kind of is an over the top Soccer version of the Harlem Globetrotters.
0316172324|3.0|This is about choices we make 'without thinking' in an instant -- at the blink of an eye.  He explains why some of \\"The best decisions are those which are impossible to explain to others.\\"  Great decision makers are those who have perfected the art of 'thin-slicing' (the theory of thin-slices: how a little bit of knowledge fors a long way), without a large amount of deliberation.      BLINK may change the way you feel about thinking before you speak and on-the-spot decisions.  We learn a lot more about what people think by observing their body language or facial expressions than by asking them directly.      A bad movie is always a bad movie.  You hate it the first time you see it, carries over to the future.  You drift away, avoid seeing movies in which those \\"stars\\" appear because of the awful feeling that other movie (the horrid thing you hated) left in your conscious and subconscious.    On t.v. people watched 'All in the Family' about a bigoted person who was truly, absurdly bad.  And yet they watched it every week.  Why?  Their subscious had become 'cushioned' to hear what they wanted to hear and let the rest slide.    Mary Tyler Moore was every young man's dream girl.  Adults, on the other hand, found her whiny and not on the up-and-up.  She was great in the 'Dick Van Dyke show' but only half as good starring in her own show.  She was my son's ideal woman, throwing her hat and her cares into the air, a big-city career girl.  She was just a dream, not an actuality.    We need to learn to listen with our eyes.  We don't know where our first impressions come from or what exactly they mean.  They often are wrong.  We make assumptions without knowing the facts of the matter.  When you get to know the person and the way he or she thinks, you realize that you miisjudged them.  It's not how a person looks which matters the most but how he feels (is he sensitive or hard as nails tough?); the eyes reflect a prson's soul.  If he won't look you in the eyes, he's not worth his weight in salt.  He's superficial.    A pure BLINK moment is when a miracle happens; they see you for who you truly are, and discover that snap decisions are usually right.  When you digress or get misled, things turn out wrong.    He also wrote THE TIPPING POINT: HOW LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE which redefined how we understand the world around us.  In BLINK, we learn to understand the world within.  Now, I am wondering: why do we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men?
B000002MJC|5.0|This is a great Depeche Mode album, but it isn't a typical Depeche Mode album. I am not an expert on the group, but out of the albums I do own, I find this to be the most emotional.<br /><br />It has a dark cast to it that results from the grunge influence that permeated music in the early to mid-90's. The guitars are harsh at times, but I don't think they are too harsh. Rather, the guitars and music complement the lyrics nicely. They really add to the theme of the album and coupled with the lyrics they really bring the emotion out.<br /><br />Lyrically the theme of this album is not all that different from Violator, but once I hear that grunge influence in the sound, this album affects me like no other Depeche Mode album does. I can almost feel the sadness and optism that Dave Gahan puts into his vocals. It is the most emotion I've ever heard from him.<br /><br />In the end, I would't say this album is full of their best material. There are many greater songs, but as a unit this is a great album worthy of recognition on its own.
0596007124|5.0|This book really deserves its 5 star rating. <br />This is definately the most interesting and entertaining book i have ever come across on the subject of design patterns. The depth and scope of coverage, makes it a very well balanced read for both design patterns and fundamentals of good object oriented design. Even though the title of the book is simply \\"Design Patterns\\", it covers some very important aspects of OO design in addition to it. <br />The books covers some very practical examples and problem scenarios that programmers and software engineers encounter in their daily environments, which makes it very valuable to the reader and fun to read as well. <br />I wish if the \\"Head first\\" series would add much more topics in their collection of publications. :) <br /> <br />Syed Ghaznavi
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I've been a Foo Fighters fan ever since that fateful moment in a Wal-Mart store when I picked a cassette of Nothing Left to Lose over some pop group I can't even remember now.  I was only 15 at the time, very impressionable, and I shudder to think what might have happened had I gone with the other band.  Would I be reviewing Rob Thomas now instead?  Scary thought, but anyway. My point is, there's a history between myself and the Foo Fighters.  There was a time when I considered the Foo equals of Nirvana, when I thought Dave Grohl was as cool as cool could be, and The Colour and the Shape was one of the greatest albums ever.  Maybe it's just the fact that I discovered better music later, but they're just not that interesting anymore.  One by One suffered enough for sounding the same, but the first disc of In Your Honor is just boring.  The guitars just keep building and building, but there aren't any singularly great moments.  \\"Best of You\\" is by far the best song on disc one, if only because it stands out.  A couple of songs are just plain bad.  Disc two, however, is a nice change. It actually has some memorable  songs, including a remake of Dave's old Pocketwatch! demo \\"Friend of a Friend.\\"  Not bad.  Three stars for disc one, four for disc two, and a wink and a prayer for the future.

0312323859|5.0|The first time I saw Sometihng Borrowed, I got attracted by the book cover. Having read the back cover, I thought \\"ugh..what a book..stealing your best friend's fiancee\\". But since Amazon gave it a good review, I bought it anyway and could not put it down. I truely enjoyed it. And for this book, \\"something Blue\\", it was even better than the first one. I practically finished it in less than two days.This book will not let you down, as it will put a big smile on your face the whole way through!
B000002URV|5.0|I've always looked at \\"MCMXC\\" which is Roman Numerals for 1990, to be the most unique and most magical of the entire Enigma catelog to date. I doubt Cretu may ever come up with anything that has the feel, nor am I looking for another \\"MCMXC\\" anyway but this is without a doubt their most popular and critically acclaimed album.<br /><br /> By the time 1990 rolled over into 1991, a very strange and unusual dance song that combined Gothic Gregorian Chants with an electronic techno beat with a dark New Age melody came in, I was absolutely mezmerized by the song. It would be many years before I would find out that it was the group Enigma nad the song \\"Sadeness\\" that took me by storm when I was just a kid at the time of it's release to radio. I bought a copy of this album on November 28, 1999 and finally acquired this great song. But that's not all there is to say.<br /><br /> The album version on here is a much grander and more epic track than the radio edit. The version on here is nearly twelve minutes long! It's actually a three-part trilogy track. The first part is the familiar single that's been popular for over 14 years as of 2005. The first part stops and the chime effects brilliantly merge into a creepy melody. The second part of the track is called \\"Find Love\\" which is perhaps my favorite part of the song. \\"Find Love\\" is arguably my favorite part of the entire track. The Dark Blue Gothic feel of the first part gives way to something like a grayish reddish mood with a new melody and a lighter jazzier and a soultry female whisper. \\"Find Love\\" goes into a state of limbo for about 30 seconds before it goes into the third part of the track which returns the journey the dark blue sounds of \\"Sadeness\\". At first it has a piano part which is really beautiful but then it reverts back to the original version and closes out this epic on a grand note. I would even go far enough to categorize this is a Prog-New Age track.<br /><br /> That's not to say that it overshadows the rest of this album either. \\"Callas Went Away\\" is a beautiful somber track which uses the drum loop from Mike and THe Mechanics 1985 track \\"Par Avion\\" and becomes a beautiful and soul-touching classic.s the rest of this album either. \\"Callas Went Away\\" is a beautiful somber track which uses the drum loop from Mike and THe Mechanics 1985 track \\"Par Avion\\" and becomes a beautiful and soul-touching classic.  <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|when i bought this cd, i was hoping for a little more rock, in line with James Lebrie's latest solo cd, and in that regard, i'm a little disappointed.  However, this is still a very strong cd that's firmly rooted in the prog-rock realm, but at the same time is more commercial-friendly, almost to the point of, dare i say, selling out! (btw....can't a brother make a little coin and still be prog?  I think so!!!!)  the opening track is actually the tail end of the last song (look at the liner notes)  The Root Of All Evil gives those who are looking to rock hard a taste of what they're looking, while sounding like a song that could possibly make radio airplay in the states, which hasn't happened much in the area i live in since \\"Pull Me Under.\\"  after that, the cd goes even more \\"commercial.\\"  \\"The Answers...\\" is a mellow respite, followed by \\"these walls\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You,\\" which build up to \\"panic attack,\\" which is classic DT.  \\"Never Enough\\" continues the traditional DT attack, while \\"sacrificed sons\\" is a somber, moody track touching on the 9/11 tragedy.  The last track, \\"Octavarium,\\" is the \\"long song\\" that every prog band needs on the cd to be called a prog band.  this epic starts kinda slow, but builds slowly into classic DT in the middle and latter sections of the piece.  Overall, a great album.  Boy, did i just date myself :)
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I know that the title seems a bit cheesy, because EVERY movie has this stigma put on it at some point, no matter how the movie is...but...THIS movie is one of the best this year to date!! A lot of movies that are being put out have been done before, and just plain remakes...not this one!  This is the story of Coach Carter and his 1999 basketball team from Richmond High, out of Richmond, CA.  Although the kids are excelling in sports, they are lacking what the real world requires of them to get ahead... <br />Coach Carter takes the team and turns the whole dynamics around...by doing the one thing that all educators of today and beyond should do...demand respect, and demand they do their utmost best...live up to thier true potential, and make something of themselves!!  <br />A moving story about the love of the game, and the love of academics...and the meaning of teamwork!!! Excellent...excellent movie...NOT to be missed!!!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Dave Grohl and company return with their fifth set, a double album, \\"In Your Honor\\". Other reviewers complain about the songs sounding all alike. True, but then that occurs on every Foo Fighters disc, so what's the point? Some complain about the copy protection. Oh yes, the political implications are endless, but the bottom line is you should have bought your copy, no stolen it. Besides, all those who complain it costs too much obviously didn't go down to say, Target, and get if for $11.99. Practically a steal for a double album.<br /><br />So what about the music? I enjoyed the electric disc more than the acoustic disc. I just prefer my Foo shaken, not stirred. However, the acoustic disc has its merits such as \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", but Grohl really tries something different by inviting jazz soulstress Norah Jones to duet on \\"Virginia Moon\\". Now, any well-rounded music listener can tell you this is a good song, and particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Foo Fighters are known for their loud rock music, not a gentler, jazzier touch. There are other acoustic gems like \\"What If I Do?\\" and \\"Razor\\".<br /><br />Yet, it is the electric disc I keep coming back to. 10 songs, 43 minutes, perfect punk rock. Well, the acoustic disc is 43 minutes and 10 songs too, so, smart thinking on the band's part as well. Someone complained all the songs meld into one big blob, but I can easily tell the difference between \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"No Way Back\\" and \\"Best Of You\\", the three lead tracks on the electric disc. Not only that, but all the songs have their own identity, yet hold together like a typical Foo Fighters album does. I enjoyed \\"In Your Honor\\" more than \\"One By One\\". Well it's all opinion anyway. I like \\"The Colour And The Shape\\" too, but things have to change and move on.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed this more than the second-rate knockoffs that are all over the radio and MTV. At least I prefer the real deal (I mean Grohl came from Nirvana, and there's only one of them). I don't understand so-called fans bashing one of their favorite artists. It's not like \\"In Your Honor\\" is a radical departure for the band. In my not so humble opinion, the Foo Fighters have yet to make a terrible record. Many bands don't even last 10 years, let alone continue to make solid recordings.<br /><br />Give this a listen 10+ times and then make your own decision. I recommend \\"In Your Honor\\" to fans, and I have all five of their albums.and there's only one of them). I don't understand so-called fans bashing one of their favorite artists.

0060977264|5.0|This book is more than beautiful. While I was reading it, I marked pages with paragraphs on them that corresponded with my life. <br />For instance:  <br /> <br />Page 48-  <br />\\"Because I've suffered, and God didn't listen to my prayers. Because many times in my life, I have tried to love with all my heart, and my love has wound up being trampled or betrayed. If God is love, he should have cared more about my feelings.\\" <br /> <br />\\"God is love. But the one who understands this best is the Virgin.\\" <br /> <br />This insert related so much to my life, that I though, \\"Hey, this book is something of a lesson.\\" (And I am just 14... and I can understand what this has to say.) <br /> <br />Overall, Coelho is an exquisite author and really has a way with wording different lessons in life. Weather it be love, God, or just life.
B000005DSN|5.0|\\"Visions\\" is by far and away the crowning moment in the musical history of Stratovarius. I thoroughly enjoyed the dreamy landscapes on \\"Twilight Time\\", the experimental splendor of \\"Dreamspace\\" and the epic grandure of \\"Fourth Dimension\\". But I'll reveal an embarassing truth about \\"Visions\\"...the first time I ever heard the opening track \\"Black Diamond\\", I became incontinent...that's how stunning this music was and is today! I also still get chills (at the very least) from the amazing song \\"Paradise\\", potentially my favorite Strat song ever! Yes, these boys have had their share of line-up changes over the years now and are getting washed out in a power metal scene that is overflowing with flashier material with updated sound. But this band was one of (if not THE) the true pioneers of the power metal genre as we define it today. And their willingness to stay devoted to music like this at a time when, at least in The United States, more bands were having financial success rapping and grunging, should never be forgotten or under-appreciated! All hail Stratovarius and their remarkable late 90's accomplishment with \\"Visions\\". An album that I still keep a box of Depends* in close proximity for, just in case I decide to listen to! 5/5 *****!
1563890410|5.0|The fourth book in The Sandman Chronicles, Season of Mists picks up where the second volume, The Doll's House left off, continuing the story of Dream and his siblings. Unlike the previous books, Season of Mists focuses mostly on immortals (or those close to it) rather than mortals. Only one of the chapters of the book even took place on earth, and that was dealing with the dead, not the living.<br /><br />Because of this slightly different format, Season of Mists introduced a lot of rather colorful characters. Some were the relatively familiar faces of Norse, Egyptian, and Eastern gods, angels, and demons, while others were new characters, delightful and colorful in their own way. I particularly liked the contrast of Order and Chaos and, of course, the faeries, but that was a given to anyone who knows me at all.<br /><br />I promise, though, I won't dwell on them here. I love Nuala, but in Season of Mists she really plays a very small roll.<br /><br />The central plot of Season of Mists is the abandonment of Hell. Lucifer closes it, turning out all the souls, and then gives the key to Dream to do with as he will. This, naturally proves far more complicated than it originally seems.<br /><br />Most of the story is concerned with the direct repercussions of this, particularly among the (relatively) immortal creatures of mythology. The result was one of the most fun chapters I've read in a long time-the chapter where they all come and present their cases to Dream, trying to win Hell for themselves. The interactions were entertaining, and the different ways that they tried to persuade Dream to give them the key to Hell, along with their reasons for wanting it and plans for it, were as varied and entertaining as they are.<br /><br />I have to admit, that I was a little disappointed with the ultimate decision, and I wish that I could have known who Dream would have chosen if no one had interceded, but I do admit that the decision that was reached was the only one that could be reached. It did, however, raise an interesting point when Hell was given to its new owners and re-populated. I'm not sure that I agree that it's worse to be tortured to be redeemed and made a better person than it is to be tortured for no reason, but I can see how, with eternal torment, this might be the case. It is, after all, easier to bear unpleasant things if you can be righteously angry about them.<br /><br />Woven in with the main story of the \\"battle\\" for Hell, was a secondary plot line. It was, for a while, seemingly forgotten once the key to Hell was handed over to Dream, but Gaiman did not forget about it, and the conclusion to that was even more satisfying, in my opinion, than the conclusion to the main story. I was glad that Nada was not forgotten in all the distractions.<br /><br />I know that there is more to Season of Mists than I've gotten out of it, but I've only read it once and, like the other books in The Sandman, it is one that must be read multiple times in order to be fully appreciated.

B00097A5HW|5.0|I love artist who play around with different sounds. This album has a great mix. I find it easy to listne to the whole album, and it is rare to find albums that aren't half-filled with tracks so annoying or boring you have to skip them. Reviews really depend if your tastes are similar so here's idea of my eclectic tastes... Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar, Kenny Loggins, Jennifer Rush, Gabrielle, Cheryl Wheeler, Kim Wilde, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, No Doubt, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Faith Hill, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, & from writer-producers.. Diane Warren, David Foster, Babyface, Rodney Jenkins, Glen Ballard, Robert Lange, Ron Nevins, & a lot of 80s stuff.. <br /> <br />La Tortura nailed me the moment I heard it on AOL Music. The video is sexy too--i understand its on the dual disc version. THe remix is intersting enough, but I prefer the originals harder hitting sound. <br /> <br />La Pared is great, and I'm not sure which version I like better.  <br /> <br />Las De La Intuicion is very \\"Kylie Minoque\\"-I laughed when I read the other reviewer. But I do like the track. <br /> <br />Lo Imprescindible and Escondite Ingles are funky tracks, and I like them for that reason. Lo Impresci... her voice at parts make me flash on a Celine DIon/Luc Plamondon song. Escondite Ingles varies from pretty to this punk wave(very early 80s to my ear) sound. <br /> <br />Dia Especial very nice and really caught my attention by the third listen. Da De Enero has pretty parts, but catches my attention less. Like it, En Tus Pupilas ha s catchy bit but doesnt sound as distinct. It actually reminds me of something I've heard on the radio in past year, but I can't connect the sound. <br /> <br />Obtener UnS is this retro 50's style song. Those fans of Michael Buble will certainly find a likeable track there. Very Girl From Ipanema. <br /> <br />No is barely noticeable when I play the album. Not annoying, just doesn't grab me. If I understood Spanish it might have another dimension. <br /> <br />I'm hoping my favorites will get translated come November (Fijacion Oral Volume 2)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't have the attention span for television.  This is why I was so surprised when--at the instigation of my family--I watched the entire Firefly series in three nights.  I went to work tired (don't tell my boss!) and then watched more the next night.  Granted, my exposure to TV is limited, but these were the most incredible shows I've seen.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Whedon's other works.  I didn't like Buffy and I've never seen Angel.  I say that to express that I can't be considered part of his \\"cult\\" as some reviewers have insisted everyone giving this show a positive review must be.  I'm just a fan of science fiction, and I think Firefly is cool science fiction. <br /> <br />I'd like to address a couple of the complaints that have been promienent: <br />True, there are no aliens.  But so what?  Someone dares to consider that we might not have encountered aliens 500 years in the future, and they're not doing sci-fi?  That's silly.  Most current sci-fi has tended to only use aliens because they can't write interesting characters.  'Let's dress someone up to look odd and people won't notice they don't have much going on in character development.'  I'll take an all human cast if it works, and in this case it does. <br /> <br />True, it is very western.  So what?  It's the frontier.  Is it hard to believe that humans will still be humans 500 years from now?  You've been watching too much Star Trek if you thinking flying around in space is going to magically change the human race.  And besides, this is a future that is LIVED IN.  It's not septic at all, it's a real place. <br /> <br />Finally, consider that virtually every negative review given was by someone who admits that they never watched more than one or two episodes.  How can you possibly judge a show by one ep?  That's like watching a random ten minutes of a movie and trying to review it.  You can't consider yourself a good judge of quality based on such a short amount of exposure. <br /> <br />This show was a fine work.  It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.  The writing is usually sharp and the story is very human.  There's not a ton of action but some of us prefer to have development and story over non-stop explosions. <br /> <br />Also of note, the creators of BSG clearly watched Firefly.  The \\"silent space\\" idea as well as the steady cam zoom-ins in BSG are virtually a rip-off from Firefly.  And that's not a complaint.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Perhaps the biggest letdown of the decade so far, X and Y is utterly painful to listen to for two reasons.  First, it is painful for me, as a listener, and second, it is painful to realize that Chris Martin actually believes that his adolescent lyrics are worth publicizing at all.  A junior high school student could do better.  The instrumentals are promising but are crushed beneath the insipid weight of the vocals.  Well, at least I can trade my copy of X and Y in for credit at my local CD store.  Chris Martin and Coldplay must live with this for the rest of their lives.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I gotta say, X&Y is a grower. Asides from 'Fix You' the album didn't grab me first time round. Be patient cause this album is pure class. Not as progressive as 'Rush of Blood...' but still a step forward in their sound which is definitely aimed more towards stadium tour sound. Chris Martin's lyrics are as haunting as ever, but its Jonny, Will and Guy who really make this album. Jonny's guitars have a distinctly Edge like quality pre Joshua Tree while Will's drums are the true rock sound of the band. <br />'Speed of Sound' much like 'In my Place' is a strange choice for first single and isn't the best song on the album. 'Square One', 'Twisted Logic' and 'Low' simmer beautifully. 'White Shadows' is a definite single. 'Fix You' has a purity and raw emotion that only songs like U2's 'One' can capture. Its 4 part harmonies after Buckland's guitars are unusual but really work, with the key change, after the second 'Tears streaming...' lyric,  so so powerful. <br /> <br />Its a great album, worth waiting for but maybe not just as diverse and pure as 'A Rush of Blood..'
B0006L16N8|4.0|First off, I like this album, and can see it growing on me (as I see some of the songs I didn't like at the first glance, now like).  However, its not to impact as A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Why?  Simply the expectations was to great for any work they would release to supress that belief.  When ARoBthH came out, it was something new, something adventurous, something that had not much expectations built in, and thus turned great.<br /><br />Buy this CD if you like Coldplay.  But buy it without giving in with all the expectations surrounding it.  I will say that the lyrics are not Gold as they were on Coldplay's first two albums, but they are worth listening too if you want to see how artists change with time.

B00005JGAB|5.0|I bought this back in the 1970's when I stood alone as the only person I knew who understood what the forerunners of punk were about. The Ramones and the Pistols were it, that's the whole package, two sides of one nasty, yet, great idea.<br /><br />Don't try to compare this to anyone,you just can't.<br /><br />The Ramones played by their own rules, but no-one elses rules applied here.<br /><br />They'll be missed.

It focuses on the fact that fear holds us back from our true potential and only those that endure the fear and push forward for their dreams will really \\"make it\\". It's more than just about money, it's about what a person wants out of life. <br /> <br />  Great joy can be had overcoming personal challenges and changing oneself for the better; asking for what you really want and then accepting the subsequent responsibilities.The resultant growth makes life a true journey and not an idle warm pond to soak in, (yawn), for eternity...

B00005JNJT|5.0|The first great film of Summer 2005 comes in the form of \\"Batman Begins\\"! I have just seen this film today with high expectations...and man, I was not disappointed in the least! The direction of Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\", \\"Insomnia\\") was absolutely mesmerizing and powerful! The special effects were mind-blowing, and the action/suspense of the film was nothing short of edge-of-your-seat! Now to the performances of the film's cast, led by superstar Christian Bale (\\"Equilibrium\\") as the Dark Knight. Bale brings a powerful presence and on-the-spot seriousness to the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. In fact, Bale is 100 times better than both Val Kilmer and George Clooney, but the best Batman of all time will always be -- (hats off, everyone) -- Michael Keaton! To me, Christian Bale's performance is about equal to Keaton's performance as Batman in the first two \\"Batman\\" films. Joining Bale are Academy Award winners Michael Caine (\\"The Quiet American\\") and Morgan Freeman (\\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), Liam Neeson (\\"K-19: The Widowmaker\\"), Katie Holmes (\\"First Daughter\\"), Gary Oldman (\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"), Cillian Murphy (\\"28 Days Later\\"), Tom Wilkinson (\\"In the Bedroom\\"), Rutger Hauer (\\"Blind Fury\\"), Ken Watanabe (\\"The Last Samurai\\"), and Linus Roache (\\"The Forgotten\\"), in which they all gave excellent, top-notch performances throughout! <br /> <br />I'm sure everyone knows the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. But for those who don't, then here's the story in a nutshell. As the movie begins, we are introduced to young Bruce Wayne (Gus Lewis), son and heir to Gotham City's humanitarian billionaire Thomas Wayne (Roache). We see Bruce endure two childhood traumas: first, a fall into a well that becomes a harrowing bat attack, and then the murder of his parents at the hands of a mugger (just the kind of impoverished soul that the good Thomas Wayne was devoting his money toward helping). Fast forward a few years, Bruce has grown up to be played by Bale and is a prisoner in an unnamed Asian country's torture camp. He is there by choice, to learn the limits of human fear and the extent to which darkness will rule a man's heart. While there, he is mentored by a league of mercenaries, led by Henri Ducard (Neeson) and the dangerous but honorable ninja leader known as Ra's Al-Ghul (Watanabe), and is taught the ways of combat and discipline. When Bruce refuses to kill an enemy of the league, they turn on him. He escapes - but not without the warning that his compassion will one day undo him. When Bruce returns to Gotham, he not only tries to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sweetheart/assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Holmes), but also assumes the rightful place as the unofficial prince of the city - a playboy billionaire with the world as his oyster. By day, that is. By night, he studies the slimy workings of the corrupt city and devises a means by which he can continue his father's work to better its people. He must be more than a man; he must be a symbol. A symbol of fear - Bruce's fear. A bat. He becomes the Dark Knight himself...Batman! As Batman, and with the help of his faithful servant Alfred (Caine), rising cop Jim Gordon (Oldman), and Wayne Enterprises weapons specialist Lucius Fox (Freeman), Bruce works to stop the city-conquering plans of mob boss Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson), the evil Dr. Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. \\"The Scarecrow\\" (Murphy), and a mysterious third party that is quite familiar with Bruce and waiting to strike when the time is right. We are introduced, along with the villains, to the elements by which we recognize and appreciate Batman and his legend: the cape, the cowl, the gadgets, the Bat Signal, the newly-redesigned Batsuit, the Batmobile. Each element is familiar and, when tweaked, made more real than in previous incarnations. <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"Batman Begins\\" is the ultimate Batman movie! \\"Batman Begins\\" has it all: an unforgettable cast, ground-pounding action, a mesmerizing and electrifying musical score, explosive special/visual effects, and dynamic storytelling! \\"Batman Begins\\" accomplishes the fact that it resurrects a fallen film franchise and an anti-hero for the 21st century. More than likely, I think there will be an upcoming \\"Batman Begins\\" sequel in the future according to the end of the film. And I imagine that by the time the Bale Batman encounters his Joker, this series will have ironed any wrinkles from the cape. All in all, no one has done it better than Christian Bale as Batman! And \\"Batman Begins\\", without a doubt, a DVD must-have!

B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna has had many great albums, Erotica, Bedtime Stories, True Blue, the list goes on and on yet, none overcome the superb album of Like A Virgin. With 3 #1 hits (Material Girl, Like A Virgin, and Dress You Up) this album shouldn't be underrated because of it's title. With pop ballads such as \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore,\\" and \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo,\\" and rock hard synthesizer beats of, \\"Pretender,\\" and \\"Angel,\\" this album holds some of her best work to date. This cd is a mere 50 minutes of great 80's music. Songs on album: <br /> <br />1)Material Girl 9/10 -- A classic song with a very catchy beat, everyone knows it! The song about a girl who doesn't want just jewelery and cars but, actual love. Music video is a classic, and is an all time favorite at her concerts. <br /> <br />2)Angel 9.5/10 -- This song suprised me when i first heard it. Vocals in this song are very vibrant with very cool effects. I especially like the dose of funk that was put in this song. <br /> <br />3)Like A Virgin 10/10 -- What is there to say about this song? One of the songs that would make Madonna a household name. Who new a simple song with simple sounds could go such a long way? This is one of my personal favorites on the album. <br /> <br />4)Over and Over 8/10 -- This song had a very cool sound to it. Reasons why I didnt like the song were because Madonna sounds very tired during the song. And its VERY repetitive (I Get Up Over and Over, I Get Up Over and Over...\\" <br /> <br />5)Love Don't Live Here Anymore 10/10 -- One of my favorite ballads from Madonna (besides Crazy For You and Bad Girl)It's got a very spicy and mysterious beat. Very orginal and Madonna sounds absolutley amazing and fresh. <br /> <br />6)Dress You Up 11/10 -- An amazingly done song with a great beat. The guitar solo is astounding. This one will make you get up and dance the whole night through. This song is worth the price of the cd. <br /> <br />7)Shoo-Bee-Doo 7/10 -- A very slow song in the beginning which eventually leads into a semi-upbeat song. I don't recommend listening to this song untill you have listened to the whole album first. It's probably the most disappointing song on the cd. But, the saxaphone solo is hot. <br /> <br />8)Pretender 10/10 -- Much like \\"Heartbreaker\\" by Pat Benatar, this song is about a man who didn't really love Madonna. Very catchy chorus (He's A Pretender, You Meet Him Everyday, He's A Pretender, The fish that got away...) <br /> <br />9)Stay 8.5/10 -- A good closing to the cd yet, it isn't superb it still has a very good beat and is good to dance to. <br /> <br />Overall this album is a 9.2/10. Highly recommended to anyone that likes the 80's Pop genre of music.  <br />
B000002G7E|5.0|i first heard about this cd form my boyfriend.  he loves pretty much any band that started out on a record so i initially blew them off as another beatles like band.  awesome, but ill give em a listen later if he brings the cd over himself.  he was tlaking about buying white light/white heat or sum other cd that i cant rember the name of anymore.  something about the name of the album grabbed my attention and i insisted that he buy that cd.  a few weeks ago i had sum money on my hands and i remembered him mentioning that i should give them a try so i decided to look at the different VU cds and just buy the least expensive.   <br />when i realized white light/white heat was the more expensive one of them all by about three dollars, i was immediately turned off and almost just clicked on another VU album.  but then the reviews caught my eye.  they all had 4 or 5 stars yet the titles suggested the reviewers hated the album.  i started reading the reviews; the horrible things these people had to say about the cd shocked me.  i believe one even said the album was one of the worst things you could force your ears to hear, but he still insisted it was the best.  when one of the reveiwers informed me that only those crazy enought to buy an album with no expectation of it being any good would actually be those to enjoy the album, i realised i was completely hooked. <br />the album definately exceeded my expectations by far.  john cale and lou reed's voices have a certain sarcastic and somehow (as the hippie reviewer stated) soothing voices.  i actually started to fall asleep towards the end of the album and i hadnt been able to sleep for days.  that of course was before sister ray came on. <br />white light/white heat is an amazing song.  i really like that one.  its one of those songs that if your one of those people who have to listen to a song 3 times before you like it, youll be shocked to find that youll love it the first time you hear it.   <br />then comes the gift.wow.  the first time i heard it wow.  its pretty happy and niave in the beginning.  its sarcastic tone kinda draws you to it even though its baiscally 8 minutes of story time with a cool guitar in the background.  the ending is definately twisted.  i could guess it by about 6 and a half minutes of it, but i nonetheless found myself sitting on the egde of my bed with my hand on my mouth listening to it dripping in anticipation as if i watching the season finale of the oc (yes im guilty of watching that show which probably shocks you even more that i really liked this album). <br />lady godiva is a really catchy song with a really cool rhyming pattern and i love the vocals.  as far as the lyrics go..well, its probably as twisted as the gift.  the next two songs go together as two love songs about the infamous  \\"she\\".  very happy feel and pretty catchy as well.  repetive but still good. <br />sister ray.  listen to it and if u have any sence at all ull listen to it more than once and all the way the through.  this band deserves a complete listen for this song.  its actually now my favorite song on the album.  its definately long as hell, but worth the listen.  the length will grow on you and the album isnt complete without it. <br />this is the only time ive ever atcually done one of these review thigns for amazon so that should tell you how much i liked this cd.  buy it.  even if you dont like, youll have the satisfaction of knowing you own probably the most interesting album there is and youll never find one like it again.
B000051Y0G|4.0|This classic contains some of the greatest 80's music there is to offer. With beautiful ballads like, \\"Time After Time\\" and the ultimate girl power anthem, \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" and has one of the most controversial songs of the 80's \\"She Bop\\" talking about girls and you know what ;) Here's my ratings of each song: <br /> <br />1)Money Changes Everything 8.5/10 -- A great opener to the album. The song contains very zany vocals. It sounds as if Cyndi is drunk, which isn't a bad thing because it goes very well with the tone of the song. The little harmonica solo is probably my favorite part of the song <br /> <br />2)Girls Just Wanna Have Fun 10/10 -- An 80's classic. This goes on the shelf along with: Madonna's \\"Like A Virgin,\\" Prince's \\"When Doves Cry,\\" and The Bangles' \\"Walk Like An Egyptian.\\" Great lyrics and the ending with all the girls singing always gives me goosebumps, weird. <br /> <br />3)When You Were Mine 6/10 -- I gave this such a bad grading because Prince's version of When You Were Mine was much catchier and overall better than Cyndi's version. It's also much slow in tempo and longer than Prince's rendition. It sounds like Cyndi ate a techno machine and started singing. And a lot of the lyrics changed. <br /> <br />4)Time After Time 10/10 -- Probably my favorite song on the album. Everyone can somehow relate to this song. Vocals are absolutley perfect. Simple instruments = Simply Amazing. <br /> <br />5)She-Bop 10/10 -- This song has a great groove. I think it was definitley underrated. A definite must if you want to have an 80's theme party. You'd be suprised how many people will start dancing to this thing. Trust Me! <br /> <br />6)All Through The Night 7/10 -- This song was an average song. Nothing too amazing or anything that stood out. Besides the synthesizers. They had a very original sound to them. But, vocals weren't hot, whatsoever. <br /> <br />7)Witness 8/10 -- This song is very much like \\"Pretender\\" by Madonna. It has a rock sound toit and sounds like Cyndi was trying to become a rebel when yelling \\"Witness.\\" <br /> <br />8)I'll Kiss You 10/10 -- A very retro sounding song. Probably my favorite upbeat song (Besides Girls Just Wanna...)Sounds a lot like the B-52's. A very catchy beat. <br /> <br />9)He's So Unusual -- No point in rating this 46 second song. It makes absolutley no sense. And it is very much out of context. <br /> <br />10)Yeah Yeah 8/10 -- An average song for the ending of a great 80's album. Downfall is that the \\"Yeah Yeah's\\" are very repetitive. And the laugh is very annoying. Overall pretty good <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album because of 4 of the songs (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and I'll Kiss You)Overall i gave this album a 8.6/10. A great buy.     <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Just bought this during my lunch hour at work. Thought some new tunes would be a nice way to finish up a rough work week. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, thanks to the copyright protection or whatever the hell they did to this, it won't play on my work computer. It is telling me I don't have the authority to play this disc, and that I need to log in as the administrator.  <br /> <br />What the hell is this? I'm not trying to copy this disc or anything like that. I just want to listen to the damn CD that I bought with my hard-earned money. <br /> <br />This thing better import to my iPod or there is gonna be hell to pay.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, I won't be buying anymore CDs that claim to be protected against unauthorized duplication.  <br /> <br />So congratulations Sony--in your attempt to ward off some people from making copies of your disc (which they will anyway--there is plenty of technology out there to get around this), you are discouraging other honest people from wasting their time trying to play your discs.
B000957O82|5.0|I just read a review that called this movie unoriginal and I must say I disagree.  I thought the concept was fresh and new.  It was great to see a movie about dating from a man's point of view (and not the point of view of just hooking up with the girl and ditching her!).<br /><br />It is a romantic comedy and Will Smitch plays Alex Hitchens, a date doctor.  He helps regular guys get girls that wouldn't normally give them a chance.  And he does this by showing them how to be attentive to the woman's needs...not by tricking them or playing them.  He gets his most difficult job ever when Albert (Kevin James) wants a supermodel!  Hilarity ensues and James makes a GREAT supporting actor in the movie.<br /><br />Of couse there is the story of Hitch's love life and his inability and lack of desire to have a relationship.  That might be the weakest part of this movie, but definitely not a reason to skip it.  I loved Will Smith in this role.
B00012L786|5.0|Watching Richard Widmark chew up this movie begs the question: \\"Why can't they make em like that anymore\\"! He is simply brilliant as a cheap petty pick pocket who lifts some microfilm from a hot chick (Jean Peters) on a train only to find that he's become involved with communist sympathisers stealing secrets from our government. At first he thinks....hmmmmmm let me cash in on this, beat up Candy, Insult some detectives, and brow beat Thelma Ritter for crossing him. Later Candy (Jean Peters) gets beat up brutally trying to protect Widmark who only twenty minutes before smacked her around pretty good himself leaving the audiience to shout at the screen: \\"Have you lost your mind\\"? Anyway she can't help her feeling for Widmark and only after about an hour and fifty minutes does he turn human and allows feelings for her to surface after she is brutaly beat up and shot protecting him. Hospital bed repentance will do that everytime. He then avenges the death of Thelma Ritter and Candy's assalt and then in the last five minute of the film flashes that \\"killer smile\\", turns almost straight, and heads off into the sunset to bed down Candy in what amounts to the strangest attraction in memory between a crook and a victim. It's film noir at its best! Hail King Richard!
B00012FXB8|5.0|This is a review of the printed edition: <br /> <br />Wow!!  This version is so much better than the theatrical release.  There is much more character development here.  The prisoners have much more dialogue amongst each other, and you really get to know who they are before their eventual demise at the hands of the alien. The relationship between Ripley and Clemmens(the doctor) is expanded.  The superintendant also has more dialogue with the prisoners.  Just makes for a better film.  This way you have a sense of who the character is when they die as opposed to them just being a piece of meat that has bit the dust on screen. <br /> <br />A few changes of note: such as the alien comes from an ox rather than a dog.  No big deal, however the birth of the alien is better.  The little alien running away after it's birth was incredibly believable.  Also, Ripley is found washed up on shore as opposed to being found in the wreck itself.  These little changes I feel actually make the film better. <br /> <br />A couple of negatives about the film:  (I can look past them though):   The big one in my view is that this particular alien was I guess left behind by the queen from the movie \\"Aliens\\".  I guess the viewer is supposed to assume that, but since she tore herself away from her \\"laying machine\\" to pursue Ripley and Newt, it does leave a few questions unanswered.  How did it get there?  Also, this facehugger apparently has implanted both Ripley and the ox.  That never happened before.  In the previous installments, the facehuggers fall off eventually and die once it has implanted the embryo. <br /> <br />Since the dog in this version is never introduced, there is a scene where a prisoner backs into a fan after being struck by the Alien.  He sees movement down a shaft which he thinks is the dog and calls out his name.  \\"Spike, hey Spike!!\\"  The dog was never introduced so who the hell is Spike.  Bad move there, at least have the dog somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br />And finally the quality of the alien I have to admit in some phases is a little cheesy looking.  Only the computer generated alien mind you.  I wish they could have gone back and redid the alien with some update computer graphics to make the alien look more believable. <br /> <br />By far the positives out weigh the negatives in this film and it is a welcomed edition to the series.  I really don't see why so many people hated it.
B000000992|5.0|to tell you the truth i say tis hard to pikc their \\"best\\" album but i disagree with it being lateralus. i dont dispute what you said about the climax of their musical creativity or whatnot...but Opiate to me stands out as their best. its one of the best debut albums i have ever heard, for a couple or reasons. first, its f'ing hard. for a band right out of the gates it has POWER depth and a definite message. lateralus (altough great because it was made by Tool) isnt my fav album. i do see what your saying though. best tool song? possibily 46 and 2

B00005KARK|5.0|One of Disney's best known and loved films, DUMBO is about a baby elephant born in the harsh world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears. Comforted by his mother until she attacks a trainer and is penned up in a jail like wagon, Dumbo eventually learns that he can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace's beautiful score flies from cheery heights to touching melodies. The movie also features a great score, which it won an Oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful \\"Baby Mine\\". The pink elephants scene is a fantastic, priceless slice of animation that I will never forget. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best.
0920668364|5.0|I first read this book to my newborn neice in 1994.  She was born with severely crossed eyes, but there was nothing to keep me from her - even 1000 miles.  When I had my first child in 1997, I bought the book for her & wrote a personal dedication.  When my son was born in 1999, he also received the book with a handwritten note.  Now my thhird child is born; he has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis; and I am ordering the book for him.  I still can't read it without crying, but it shows the intensity of a parent's love for a child.  We, as parents, will ALWAYS be there for our children.
B00001QEE9|3.0|The second feature-length Disney animated movie PINOCCHIO is a perennial children's favorite, however it differs from other films in tone and strays too far from Carlo Collodi's book, but perhaps that's a good thing. The film's morals are too heavy-handed and the animation doesn't quite sparkle like SNOW WHITE and DUMBO, but this has been a very impressionable film in Hollywood history, particularly on filmmaker Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters) and is hailed by critics and audiences alike. The songs are memorable and catchy, and the underwater scenes with Pinocchio and Monstro are the highlight of the film. However Collodi's aforementioned book arguably overly-influenced the movie's final tenor. I've never been a big aficionado of the book (Pinocchio kills Jiminy Cricket then Pinocchio gets hung up on a tree then dies (!) Animal mutilation, dismemberment, death, despair, destruction, all dished out in spades. Therefore it seems unfair to criticize the film for its darker moments, considering the large amount of omitted scenes.  But this still isn't my favorite, and it's too scary for some kids. A classic in some quarters, but not perfect.
0743454537|3.0|This starts out as a great book.  It is riveting, and the character of Anna draws you in.  The prose and imagery are good.  There are story problems, such as the grandparents supposedly being long-dead before Anna is born, yet Anna remembers Granny's funeral.  Somewhat troubling, oversights like that.  But they could be ignored if the author hadn't copped out of the serious issue she began addressing in this story. <br /> <br />The dilemma of harming a healthy child to help a sick one is definitely thought-provoking.  The fact that the mother is so cold-blooded in her single-minded interest in the sick daughter is chilling.  She is the only unsympathetic character, and indeed, she is two-dimensional and unlikeable. <br /> <br />The story should have been one about hard choices and how lives are forever affected by them.  Instead, the author copped out completely, took an easy way out as a supposed \\"shocking twist,\\" and left the reader completely unsatisfied.  The isues of what would happen if one difficult decision or another were made were never addressed.  Instead, the author shoved them into a closet and diverted attention to avoid dealing with those issues. <br /> <br />It was deeply disappointing, and the entirely improbable, forced ending ruined the entire book.  It's a terrible shame, because it started off so well. <br /> <br />

0156012197|5.0|I must say that this book is not about a little prince, it has a deeper meaning, so if you see any reviews rating it only with 1 star, please disregard them. I don't usually buy books, but even I have thissmall novel. I just found it fasinating in how many languages it has been published. English, French, even Lithuanian (I know, I saw it). So instead of reading some Harry Potter for the 100th time, read this book.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki. This movie I hadn't seen so I presumed it was good. The critics said it was good, so I bought it at my local Target for 20 dollars. It was worth every penny! It was probably one of the absolute best movie by Miyazaki. It was rated PG-13 for the graphic war scenes which got better and better! I love this movie! You will love it!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious me and my friends still break into hysterical laughter when this movie is mentioned it is simply great.  <br /> <br />Now this movie may not appeal to all people because the humore only works witha person that is intrested in this kind of humor which is the kind of thing wher people will find someone so nerdy or stupid funny mso if u don't laugh at these kinds of things then you'll probably be in for an hour and a half of boredom so i wouldn't do that if i were you. <br /> <br />The plot centers around Napoleon Dynamite a sort of nerdy and ackward anti-hero, who lives at home with his 34 year old brother. Napoleon teams up with his friend Pedro so Pedro can be elcted class president against a popular valley girl (HaylieDuff)  I'm not really sure what the charm is about this movie it may be the sudden shouts of NO I DON\\"T FEEL LIKE IT or IDIOT or WORST DAY OF MY LIFE WHAT DO YOU THINK or maybe Napoleon's dance moves or his love for tater tots.  I don't really know but if you like this kind of humore then i strongly suggest you get this movie.
B00005OWEG|2.0|I HATE war movies.  <br /> <br />Apocalypse Now, as it was originally released, was not a war movie; it was a work of art, a nightmare captured on film. The first time I saw it, I walked out of the theater stunned and speechless, and I am still left in that same state every time I watch the DVD. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Apocalypse Now Redux has been Redu-ced to nothing more than a war movie, the nightmare subsiding and reality taking over. Once a masterpiece of film, every frame worthy of a spot in the Louvre, is now just another... war movie. What a shame.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Sam Shepard, the actor-writer, wrote this beautiful film; his friend Wim Wenders directed it. This is a cinematic emotional masterpiece with a core that points straight to the things we love and says, Are we in love with them as they are, or as we imagine them to be?<br /><br />The title is a perfect representation of this point; it's the town where Travis, played by Harry Dean Stanton in probably his best role on screen, was conceived and where his father said his mother was from, without giving the name of the state, only the town. Paris--as in France--is the fantasy. Paris--as in Texas--is the reality. Did his father love his mother for what she was, a plain girl from Texas, or what he imagined her to be, a \\"fancy woman\\" from France?<br /><br />Travis has the same problem; he's the real focus of the film and around him the Texas twilight casts long, sad shadows that glisten with hope, brilliant colors, and soon to be approaching night. In him's a heart that's torn between his love for what he knows and for what he wants to run away from, between his son, Hunter, his ex-wife Jane, and himself. The only one of these he knows is real is his son, who's the second core of the film. Hunter is the reality of his marriage to Jane, the one thing he knows is solid and true and right in front of him.<br /><br />Nobody makes films like this anymore.

B00067BBQE|1.0|Great band, coulda been a great dvd concert, but it is ruined by whatever hacks they hired to produce it. Camera angles are freakin horrendous, the editing is not even first year film class garbage and whoever did the 5.1 mix should be fired and never allowed to work in the industry again. It's 2005. We shouldn't still be seeing craptacular production like this.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.  <br /> <br />The Series: <br />1- BATMAN BEGINS <br />2- BATMAN <br />3- BATMAN RETURNS <br />4- BATMAN FOREVER <br />5- BATMAN & ROBIN
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the show that StarTrek:Enterprise should have been.  Real, complex characters.  Engaging plots.  The special effects were good, but they were never more important than character and plot. Strong, interesting male & female characters.  Wicked humor.      Firefly never jumped the shark, it didn't even have time to get remotely close to the shark tank.  FOX network cancelled it after the first season.      About two decades ago, I endured U.S. Army basic training at Ft. Knox.  The Army controlled EVERY aspect of my life that it could, as you can imagine.  I remember seeing a colorful sunrise one cold October morning, and thinking to myself \\"The Army can't take the sky from me\\".
B00097DX3U|2.0|I really love the first CD; the vocals, the lyrics, everything, but I don't understand what happen with them. There is nothing new, it sounds like they include here the remaining songs of \\"Audioslave\\". Is almost the same, but without the passion and innovation. Only two songs could be the exception, but it's almost boring to listen.
0671027387|5.0|This was a very fast and entertaining read & just like the other Dan Brown books I couldn't put it down. It amuses me to read comments made by show-offs who pretend to be rocket scientists. Sure this book makes you suspend your disbelief; sure it talks about non-existent technologies and describes unrealistic situations. News flash: it's a book, it's not real! Does SCIENCE FICTION ring a bell?  That's the beauty of it, you get to write about people/places/things that do not exist. How boring would fiction novels be if they were all confined to the bounds of our reality? Want facts? Read an encyclopedia, not a fiction novel. Want realistic situations and events? Pick up a biography, not a thriller.<br /><br />If you're thinking about reading this book don't be a devil's advocate and enjoy this book for what it is - a great fiction thriller.<br /><br />That's just my two cents :)<br /><br />---------------------------------<br /><br />Science fiction - A literary or cinematic genre in which fantasy, typically based on speculative scientific discoveries or developments, environmental changes, space travel, or life on other planets, forms part of the plot or background.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|Before I start, let me first say that I am biased towards this album. It isn't my favorite by Rush (I think their peak years were '78 to '85) but that is just because the others of the aforementioned era are, well, just too good. Following Hold Your Fire, Presto is a much lighter and poppier album, employing acoustic against electric guitars (like Roll the Bones) and some piano. Presto, many feel, is marred considerably by a very light sound due to production. While this is true, I have to say that Alex's guitar sound is great (much improvement upon Hold Your Fire) and the drum sound, while not emphasizing the cymbals as much, is very good. Presto has a lot of good melodies on it, still often synthesized, but just as often played by guitar and sometimes accented by piano (in Anagram, Red Tide, Available Light, and The Pass). The Breakdown:    Show Don't Tell--has a very refreshing guitar driven sound and rolling                     time changes 5/5  Chain Lightning--great melody and groove 5/5  The Pass--One of the band's favorite songs, inspirational music and                     lyrics 5/5  War Paint-- underrated, good melody and lyrics 5/5  Scars--funky 80's bass-riff driven song with much rhythmic exploration                    from Mr. Peart 3/5  Presto--great acoustic sound and melody 5/5  Superconductor--this one rocks out 4/5  Anagram--good chorus melody, you only notice that the lyrics attempt to                   be anagrams because of the title 4/5  Red Tide--synth riff is a little harsh, good melody 4/5  Hand Over Fist--good use of acoustic guitar like \\"Presto\\" interesting                    lyrics 4/5  Available Light--great melody best song on the album 5/5
B00097DX3U|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out on May 24, 2005 at Target for $9.98. That was the best $10 i've ever spent. This cd is genius every single song on it. At first when i listened to this cd i thought it was great except for a few songs   (Heavens Dead, The Worm, Your Time Has Come?. Then I actually listened to the lyrics and I was amazed at what they had written. My favorite songs on this disc are Doesn't Remind Me, Dandelion, Man or Animal, Be Yourself, Drown Me Slowly, Heavens Dead, And Out of Exile. <br /> <br />I Recomend this cd to anyone who likes good music. <br /> <br />
0140439110|4.0|Stevenson's famous \\"shilling shocker\\" from 1886 has almost been distilled into a diagnostic commonplace.  The notion of the \\"Jekyll & Hyde\\" personality has become a shorthand description for someone who leads a psychological double-life.  Stevenson's tale dwells on the dangers of duplicity and addiction, and the unpredictable consequences of starting down the slippery slope: once you start giving in to the darker half of your nature, it isn't always possible to go back.  The idea is well known, generally from the numerous screen adaptations, but the original story isn't.  It's well worth reading, especially in this fine edition from Penguin.  Apart from including some lesser known tales from Stevenson, editor Robert Mighall provides detailed notes, an excellent introduction, and a fascinating final essay entitled, \\"Diagnosing Jekyll: the Scientific Context to Dr Jekyll's Experiment and Mr Hyde's Embodiment\\".  This essay situates Stevenson's tale in the context of nineteenth-century London society, considers the likely contemporary medico-scientific explanations for Jekyll's \\"case\\" (including the memorably named condition of \\"masturbatic insanity\\"), and also reveals the impact Stevenson's work had on the public's interpretation of the real-life criminal case of Jack the Ripper.  Mighall's commentary will also appeal to literary-critical readers who'll want to think about the narrative device of presenting a supernatural tale through the testimony of doctors, lawyers and written documents.  Mighall also identifies some slip-ups in Jekyll's final confession which suggest he isn't quite as neatly divided as he claims.  This is an excellent edition for student readers, or for those who like to read so-called classics in context.
0783227019|4.0|This movie gets a 4 because the middle to the end of the film was really good. That's where all the action and drama come up. The beginning of the movie was not all that interesting as the last part was,the way I see it. The end was filled with all the backstabbings, betrayals, really smart moves, and action! I was glad when Carlito's (pacino) lawyer got dealt with in the end because he was so shady and conniving that no one knew it. Seriously, you could call this a Scarface-remake movie since Pacino,the thug dons, and thug storylines are in it, only thing is he tries to be good, though it's not that easy.
0375703764|5.0|Wow. This is a book I tried reading 2 or 3 times before finally getting into it, and once I got into it I was seriously hooked. Suspenseful, challenging, absolutely scary, it is quite the read, and is really a category by itself. So many images keep coming back to you afterwards. Hallways that go nowhere...maybe. Sounds inside the walls...things that literally don't measure up. I cannot recommend it enough. Try hard to get the copies with the subtle coloring of some of the words (for example, the word \\"house\\" is printed in blue), it adds an errie effect.
B0000026VZ|2.0|Even by the standards of anonymous 1980's arena rock Toto were pretty faceless (quick, name one member without looking it up) making generally bland, generic rock that offend only those who were offended by calculated inoffensiveness.  This approach led to a total of 14 chart singles many of which were so forgettable that they aren't even included on this greatest hits collection (quick: can anyone hum a few bars of \\"Make Believe,\\" \\"Without Your Love,\\" or \\"Stranger in Town\\" each of which cracked the US Top 40, yet none of which are included here)?      Still, every once in a while the band managed to click with a 45 rpm that stuck in one's consciousness for more than 20 seconds after it was over.  \\"Rosanna\\" is one of those annoyingly catchy songs that slowly loosens the grip sanity has on your brain -- like Edgar Alan Poe's \\"The Tale Tale Heart\\" is plays relentlessly in your head zapping away brains cells one by one while \\"Africa\\" managed to sustain memorability with a graceful melody and became the band's lone #1 hit.    Both of those songs are here for anyone willing to plop down the bucks for this collection, but that's still a lot of dough for a measly two songs and a truck load of filler, no?
B000002UDB|4.0|Sure, the film Magical Mystery Tour may have been an odd, pointless exploit.  But, that doesn't (or shouldn't) put anything against this \\"soundtrack,\\" which more or less could have been released without any film (and certainly can be enjoyed without ever seeing the film.)   <br /> <br />The first six songs of the CD are the only ones to appear in the film; in fact, in Europe, these six were released on an EP.  The album starts with the rollocking title track, which you'll enjoy more if you look at not as the theme song of the movie and album, (there's little magic about this album, except how good some songs are), but as an easy-as-pie Beatles rocker.  From there, the album pretty much works as an excellence showcase of each Beatle's developing songwriting skills (of course, Ringo doesn't have a song, but, [and I'm sorry to say this] few people will mind.)  John tears it up the most here, especially on \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\"  Paul's Penny Lane is also pretty amazing, indeed one of the best songs he's ever written.  George even showbouts a little with \\"Blue Jay Way,\\" a decent Eastern-influenced tune.  All in all, MMT is short, and it does indeed feel like little more than a collection of singles (side B is all already-released singles), but it remains an underrated album that holds many of their best classics. <br /> <br />1.  Magical Mystery Tour:  A short, simple Beatles rocker with an awesome beat and truly dynamic sound.  9/10. <br /> <br />2.  Fool On the Hill:  One of McCartney's better-written songs, it presents a soothingness you won't mind after hearing the title track.  9/10 <br /> <br />3.  Flying:  An instrumental that fits perfectly with the era, and with the movie itself.  Of course, I wouldn't sit down and listen to it nonstop.  6/10 <br /> <br />4.  Blue Jay Way:  A cool-sounding Harrison number, indeed one of the best of his songs that appear on Beatles albums.  9/10 <br /> <br />5.  Your Mother Should Know:  I've never been crazy for this one, a jazzy dance hall number by McCartney, in the same style as \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"  7/10 <br /> <br />6.  I Am the Walrus:  THIS is what I'm talking about!  Excellent vocals, lyrics and studio effects.  And, listen to the basslines-- damn groovy!  10/10. <br /> <br />7.  Hello, Goodbye:  A lyrically inferior song that is admittingly catchy.  8/10. <br /> <br />8.  Strawberry Fields Forever:  This is possibly my overall favorite Beatles song (not that I could really pick one), the studio effects, lyrics, and vocals got me again here.  It's beautiful.  10/10 <br /> <br />9.  Penny Lane:  An extremely uplifting and infectious piece.  It has the power to make anyone recall their childhood memories!  From someone who is much more of a Lennon fan, I'll admit that this song is great, possibly the best on this album under Strawberry Fields.  10/10 <br /> <br />10.  Baby You're A Rich Man:  This one's always seemed like the odd song out, it seems to have a lot different sound than any of the other songs on here.  Not bad.  8/10. <br /> <br />11.  All You Need is Love:  Ah, what a way to end the album.  A pretty ditty that leaves some great insight on the listener.  10/10.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This movie is so awesome!I am a huge Batman fan and this film really makes up for  <br />all of the bad Batman films before this one. <br />  To start off the directing was brilliant it was filmed excellently.Christopher Nolan deserves at least an Oscar Nomination for his job.And the way he filmed the fight scenes was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole fight. <br />  The story was excellent.It had enough twists and turns to keep you on your seat on all times.And I loved its focus on story and character development.I also loved the way that they didn't have one major villian,they had two or three minor villians which worked excellently.All in all it was excellently written. <br />  And the acting was top notch.Christian Bale is the definitive Batman.And Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Liam Neeson,Katie Holmes,Morgan Freeman,and Cillian Murphy all delivered some of their best performances I have seen. <br />  The production of it was also real top notch.The set and prop design was fantastic,it made you feel as if you were watching the comic.And the new batsuit and batmobile were really cool! <br />  And to top it off this score was fantastic.Although not as memorable as Danny Elfmans it was great.Right from the start it established the mood and atmosphere of the film. <br />  All in all this movie was superb.It definitely gets my vote as one of the best movies of all time!!!!!!
B0007TKNL0|1.0|The new movie is awful, I was SO disapointed. <br />The movie is nothing like the Broaway.  <br />I have seen it, and I thought it was just a waste of time. <br />If you love the Broadway \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" You probably don`t want to see the movie.  The only good characters in the whole movie are Madame Giry, Meg, and Raul. <br /> On the whole I was just Very disapointed.
B00006GA4C|4.0|Quite simply their best album. They were always better as a three piece Band. Sounds best when played super-loud!
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam surfaced in late 1990 following the death of Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood. Pearl Jam founding members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament had played in MLB following the split of their earlier band, Green River, into MLB and Mudhoney. <br /> <br />Vocalist Eddie Vedder was recruited, referred as I recall it by former Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons, who would himself later join Pearl Jam. The band was completed by lead guitarist Mike McCready and drummer Dave Krusen, now handling sticks for Candlebox. <br /> <br />Anyway, for the sake of placement, a little more background: Ten was released in 1991, to critical acclaim. The band toured solidly behind the release; at the same sort of time, other Seattle bands were making their marks as well. It all eventually broke open and the world went to town with \\"grunge.\\" Pearl Jam went on to enjoy a Christmas #1 in a handful of European countries with their landmark single Alive in 1992. The other hits Jeremy and Even Flow followed, taking the album into the 10-million sales worldwide. <br /> <br />But that's kinda where it all fell apart as well. The hype overshadowed the music, and the touted 4th single, Black, never got a release. Jeremy, a song about a schoolboy's in-class suicide, was huge - the video garnered several awards - but the band did not want the same level of consciousness for Black and so the single wasn't released. This began an era of virtual darkness for the band, with no further tracks being turned into videos for some time. <br /> <br />Hype aside, what about the album? Well, it's epic. The songs are all awesome; the musicality of the whole thing almost unsurpassable, I thought. The band were beyond competent as musicians, there was something in it to satisfy everyone, and most importantly, the material was deeply, deeply personal to the band. Vedder is always a man who seems on top form and the album showcases his versatility in producing angst-ridden howling, pure aggro and gentle, thoughtful introspection while delivering his message. He also is a man with demons to conquer. This is perhaps why the hype put them off. <br /> <br />I could go on at length here about Vedder having had a very rough time at home but others have detailed it far better than I could. Suffice to say, the songs lay bare a lot of issues for Eddie Vedder, and you can't fault him for doing that in his art. That's kinda the point of art, I'm told. <br /> <br />Ten stands apart as a Pearl Jam album, because everything subsequent to Ten was different. While it is all unmistakeable as Pearl Jam, the later material moved in a different direction, musically and personally, I feel. Ten is also very much a studio album; the Parashar brothers did a superb job on the production of it. The album name comes from bassist Ament's passion for basketball and his favourite player's jersey number, Nets/Hawks/Warriors guard Mookie Blaylock. <br /> <br />Ten was the first CD I ever bought when I finally got a CD player. I had had a pirate copy of both Ten and the follow-up Vs on cassette for about 6 months at that stage and had overplayed them both. It was my favourite album for about 3 years before I really discovered Alice in Chains and properly rediscovered Vs.
B00070EBBM|5.0|This recording dates back to Gilels' visit to the US in 1958.  It was eclipsed in RCA's catalog by Sviatoslav Richter's recording of the piece in 1960 with the same orchestra under Eric Leinsdorf  (Reiner was supposed to conduct but was ill).  Richter's recording got huge publicity and critical praise.  Gilels had a much lower public profile than Richter: he was not as dramatic a figure, not as controversial, nor was he touted as being a genius.  Gilels' recording was rereleased on RCA's low-priced Victrola label in 1964 and kicked around in RCA's catalog for some time with little notice.  It's a shame; it is a fine performance.<br /><br />Gilels and Reiner make a fine team.  More a continuous conversation between piano and orchestra than the traditional showcase for the soloist, this piece requires a conductor who is more than an accompanist and a soloist who is willing to collaborate on a shared vision.  Gilels and Reiner work hand-in-glove, taking a muscular, dynamic approach to the piece which emphasizes its classical form.  Tempi are appropriate if a bit on the brisk side.  The taut sound Reiner created with the Chicago Symphony is the perfect complement to Gilels' clear and transparent pianism. Gilels keeps the lines crystal-clear, the structures evident, the emotions present but always held in balance, his sound big and still transparent.  The third movement is a gem, a marvel of dynamic shading and light, lyrical touch.  The clarity of sound and transparency of textures gives the performance a chamber-music feel, perfectly appropriate in a piece many commentators have likened more to chamber music than a traditional concerto.<br /><br />The Chicago Symphony plays well, with commitment and passion as they always did for Reiner.  RCA's sound in its 1950's early stereo recordings from Chicago was excellent for its time, and stands up very well even today.<br /><br />I've had both this performance and the Richter/Leinsdorf in my collection since the late 1960'sin some form or other.  While Richter does astonishing things with the first two movements, it is the Gilels' performance I keep coming back to.  To draw the distinction between the two performances broadly, Richter is more the romantic and Gilels is more the classicist -- and since both strands are there in Brahms, both performances work well in their different ways.  Gilels/Reiner is as close to a \\"classic\\" interpretation as I can find: balanced, clear, communicative and not prone to excesses in any direction.  They are a more equal partnership than Richter and Leinsdorf; as much as Leinsdorf is a fine accompanist in that recording, he is an accompanist, not a real co-creator, and the performance shows it.  And, for what it's worth, I think the Chicago Symphony plays better for Reiner.<br /><br />I have not heard Gilels' later recording of this piece with Jochum so I cannot compare them.  There is a feeling of \\"rightness\\" about this performance, and knowing what I do of Jochum's conducting style, I would anticipate that performance to be more weighty but might not necessarily have that same chamber-music feel.  Gilels/Reiner will stand up to rehearing after rehearing, year after year, and continue to show new marvels.  It's a shame that this extraordinarily expensive version is the only one currently available.
B0002OERI0|2.0|puhleese! this album is a shame to green day and all of their previous albums. american idiot is not their best work in fact it doesn't even sound like the green day i know and love. this is not a five star album its elementary in everything that makes it up. the music, the vocals THE SONGS IN GENERAL. a complete dissappointment-
B000003EUL|4.0|I first heard this recording in the mid-1960's.  I'd been listening to Richter on Russian recordings for several years (some Beethoven sonatas, the Tchaikovsky piano concerto, etc) and knew what a superb artist he was.  Initially I was blown away by this recording.   The first movement is extraordinary.  Richter reimagines and recreates the piece, bringing spontaneity to his performance as only he could.  My only point of comparison for such a strong recreation in the piano concerto repertoire, interestingly, is Ivo Pogarelich's reading of the first movement of Chopin's second piano concerto (Abbado conducting).  There is a headlong quality, romantic and passionate and noble.  Just astonishing. <br /> <br />The second movement is nearly as original, and nearly as good.  The third and fourth movements are lovely and gorgeously played, and if it hadn't been for what Richter did in the first movement, they would be just fine.  But somehow they seem ordinary after such an extraordinary beginning. <br /> <br />A word about Leinsdorf: he was at best a maddeningly inconsistent conductor.  Here he provides good accompaniment to Richter, but he is still an accompanist in a piece which requires the orchestra to be an equal partner with the piano.  I understand that at the end of his life Richter complained that he was unhappy with this recording and that Leinsdorf pushed the tempi.  Whatever Richter's reasons for saying that may have been, I have a hard time believing that the choice of tempi, in the first two movements in particular, were not Richter's.  His whole approach is so integrated, the phrasing and dynamics flow so perfectly from the tempi, that Richter either chose them himself or he responded incredibly to Leinsdorf's preferences. <br /> <br />The sound is fine.  The Reinter-era Chicago Symphony plays well (although they play better for Reiner himself in his nearly contemporaneous recording of this same piece with Emil Gilels).  4 stars, not because the performance isn't fine, but only because it could have been so much more extraordinary.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|To correct a previous review, the full-length DVD does have individual song selection.  Just select \\"George's Band\\" from the Main Menu.

B0006L16N8|5.0|As we all know, Chris Martin's sensitive guy persona (I'm not saying it's just an act) tends to get cloying, but you can't deny that Coldplay are capable of some truly dramatic music. This disc has a little less variety and experimentation than Rush of Blood, but Coldplay continue to refine and expand their basic approach. These guys have mastered the art of sounding both graceful and powerful at the same time, with a shimmery sound that is getting more grandiose, echoey, and spacious with each album. This is pop music with big ambitions and an underlying tension that just barely stays beneath the surface, pushing the songs well beyond their simple pop structures. \\"Talk\\" and \\"Low,\\" are the album's two best tracks, displaying both low-key sensitivity and high-flying musical drama, while other tracks like \\"Square One\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\" have a slowly simmering angst that just barely remains under wraps. The non-Chris guys seem to be asserting themselves more, especially guitarist Jonny Buckland, while drummer Will Champion remains the band's closet rocker. As for Chris Martin, he has countered the band's bigger music with smaller lyrics, about remaining humble and down to earth. And given his tabloid-prone hugeness, he actually sounds believable most of the time. Based on the other music I listen to, I should hate everything about popsters like Coldplay. However, I know sheer talent when I hear it. [~doomsdayer520~]
B00008YLV2|4.0|As happens with most books, movies often do not do justice. The book was excellent and for the most part, Ridley Scott stayed true to the book. It seems that a lot of reviewers had problems with this movie because it didn't go deeper into the politics of what was going on in Somalia. Those reviewers missed the point. This is a movie about a mission gone wrong (although the main objective was accomplished) and how the men fought through it, nothing more. The movie wasn't too \\"hollywood\\" (I'm a Marine grunt, so...)and like I said, mostly true to the book. All in all, buy this movie, but to make the experience 10 times better (there is more to the story), read the book. You won't be disappointed.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Even if you are not a teen you will love this movie. It is teen romantic comedy done in a smart, savy and entertaining way.

This is nothing like my favorite CD, Volume three, being so heavy it gets old real fast. <br /> Shocking to say that the only good song on this Cd \\"Left Behind\\" is one of the best ever on a cd filled with poor punchlines, bad vocals, machoish phrases, and everything rhymes (Which gets old very fast.) If you like Volume 3 then I can't promise enjoyment on Slipknot's earlier albums.
B0009OPO0S|1.0|I have been one of the biggest fans of shakira, but this CD is not worth it. I pre-ordered 5 copies of the cd to give to other fans, such as my sisters and boyfriend, but I regreted it so bad. Why after a cd like Laundry Service, this is nothing?
0767802659|3.0|Lacked in the execution.  Making a heavy, ironic, political film which also happened to be a really big-budget sci-fi flick; this is a big, big undertaking, and perhaps deserved years of work to do it right.  It definitely deserved more thoughtful screenwriting and dialogue.  And more overt humor, or better.      You can look at this movie as the other face of \\"Independence Day,\\" an obvious piece of Hollywood propaganda if there ever was one.  But where this movie nearly failed by not being clever enough in its tricky subversive wit, \\"Independence Day\\" succeeded by being so d________ stupid as to be sheer camp. In each case, the enemy is loathesome, faceless, icky, and thoroughly deserving of extinction.  There is just a little tongue-in-cheek in this movie that feels appropriate, if not well-executed.  You could watch \\"Independence Day\\" or \\"Starship Troopers\\" with a big pitcher of martinis, and both would have a similar effect, but I wish this one made me laugh as much as the other.
0399143904|5.0|This is an excellent book, combining poltical drama and all out action, however there are a few things clancey has messed up on. For example, you'll somtimes read the british soldiers saying \\"chaps\\" and smoking pipes etc. Please remember, these are SAS, the toughest fighting force in the world, do u really think they'd be smoking pipes and speaking with posh RP accents, this isnt the 1930's! Also when its summer in the west, its winter in australia, big error. However despite a few problems it is a very good book, and I highly reccommend it, i'm still giving it 5stars.
B000002LSV|4.0|ZZ Top, without question, are one of the finest southern rock/blues bands on the face of the earth. Their music can be fun, hip, and majestic at the same time. This is one of plenty of hits/best of compliations for the band, the one I'm reviewing, was released in 1992. How does it measure up from the band's era from the 70s through early 90s? Read on for my review for the pros and cons section.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-IT'S GOT MOST OF THE BIG HITS A CASUAL FAN COULD EVER NEED. You got their biggest hits from this peroid of their career, like La Grange, Tush, Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, and Cheap Sunglasses, to name a few.<br /><br />-YOU GET SOME NEW TRACKS HERE FOR BONUS TREATMENT! New material includes Viva Las Vegas, Doubleback, and Gun Love. Plus, the version of Legs you get on here is a Remix, basically the same thing as the Eliminator version, but even longer and better!<br /><br />-AS WELL AS THE BIG HITS, YOU GET SOME UNDERRATED MASTERPIECES HERE AS WELL. Songs like Tube Snake Boogie, Planet of Women, and Give It Up, which weren't quite big hits, are included here.<br /><br />-IT'S CHEAP AT MOST PLACES NOW. A casual fan will be in paradise once they see it for about 8.99, so that is very excitingly affordable.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-WHERE'S TV DINNERS? WTF!? I can see that they used many songs from Eliminator, but this ominission is unforgivable, since it was one of the band's biggest hits!<br /><br />-EVEN WORSE, THIS DISC ONLY COVERS THE BIG HITS OF THE 70S, THE ENTIRE 80S, AND SOME OF THE 90S. Sure, there's 18 songs here, but, One Disc does NOT do the band justice. Luckily there's a dual-disc counterpart, Rancho Texicano: The Very Best Of ZZ Top, which is MUCH better if casual fans want to shell out the cash. Other songs MIA on here are Jesus Just Left Chicago, Heard It On the X, and Waiting For the Bus.<br /><br />-NO SONGS FROM THE FIRST 2 CD'S, NONE FROM THE 1976 RELEASE TEJAS, OR FROM THE POST-RECYCLER ALBUMS. Like I said, there's a better dual-disc counterpart called Rancho Texicano (though no post-Recycler material isn't on there &lt;_&lt;).<br /><br />Anyway, that's all for now, I might update that in the future. My advice is that if you're a casual fan and want to start with a hits compliation, start here. Or, even better, if you want to shell out that extra cash, get the dual-disc Rancho Texicano. Otherwise, if you want to start with an original album, Eliminator would be a fine choice. Peace!t called Rancho Texicano (though no post-Recycler material isn't on there &lt;_&lt;).  <br /> <br />Anyway, that's all for now, I might update that in the future.

B000002UA5|1.0|I've had the LP of Ummagumma since its inception and, as others have stated, it is a psychedelic masterpiece.  Being my album is worn out, I tried to purchase the CD from Amazon recently.  However, upon receipt, I found that it contained two copies of the \\"studio\\" disk and no copy of the \\"live\\" disk.  I reported it to Amazon and they rushed out a replacement promptly.  Unfortunately, the replacement also had two studio disks.  Since they felt that all their copies contained the same packaging snafu, they cancelled my order.  Nuts.  The best part of the album is the \\"live\\" side.  Maybe someday they'll get it together and I can get what I ordered.  Four and a half stars for the recording, one star for what I was sent.
B00003CWL6|2.0|It must have been ESP which kept me from seeing this movie for so many years as I found it extremely disappointing and incredibly overrated.  Although, it is undeniable that Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are wonderful in their roles, and that the camera work is quite impressive.  However, these are the few elements in the film that actually do impress.<br /><br />The amount of mindless cliches inherent to these characters is appalling.  American Beauty never fails to present people through the looking glass of trendy, political correctness.  Nowhere is this more true than with the gay couple, Jim and Jim.  They are the only normal adults in the movie.  By depicting them as a picture of stability, normality, and kindness, it is apparent, amidst the dysfunctionality everywhere else, that the creators are more concerned with trying to make a positive statement about homosexuality than present a meaningful film.  If all gay men formed the strong bonds these two possess, then there would never be any stigma to homosexuality in the first place.  The fact is that only within the gay male population do you find, when polled, anyone who's ever had 10,000 or more lifetime sexual partners.  Of course such a level of promiscuity is not the norm, but the majority do not live in mansions out in the suburbs with tax attorneys. What we see here, unfortunately, is pure spin.<br /><br />Even worse, and completely inexcusable, is the rendering of the Marine Colonel, Mr. Fitts.  Unlike the role model gay couple who, despite being a statistical abnormality, are actually representative of some gay Americans, I'm willing to bet that the Colonel is like no military man on this earth.  Certainly, he is nothing like any that I have met in my 35 years.  Fitts is an utter fiction produced by the mind of someone who hates this nation and our armed forces.<br /><br />The Colonel's method of leading his family is to beat him son and force him to take semi-annual drug tests.  His wife is even less a real person than he is.  She's a refugee from Valley of the Dolls and has been demoralized to the point of appearing a zombie.  From the moment we encounter Fitts, his accent and style of speech should alert anyone familiar with Hollywood's methods that he will be an example of intolerance.  Whenever one hears rural inflections on the big screen, one must realize that the individual will be endlessly derided by the tofu mandarins who intolerantly judge the rest of us from their perches on the left coast.  After all, in the moviemaker's configuration, only sadistic, close-minded, evil men would ever volunteer to defend the United States in the first place.<br /><br />That they could actually try to pass off this World War I drill master as a Colonel, let alone an actual human being, speaks volumes of how little they know about the armed forces and the disdain they have for the brave individuals who guard us while we sleep.  One cannot avoid having the impression that the director and screenwriter had never previously even met a member of the Marine Corps.<br /><br />The Colonel comes straight (sic) out of the GLSEN handbook for homophobia.  He is a caricature, the type of person \\"whose hate will not save him.\\"  We discover, just as the politically correct manuals would predict, that he himself is secretly gay.  Well, of course he is, isn't everyone who disagrees with gay activists?  His existence is meant to dupe us into thinking that homophobia is not really a hysterical fabrication even though the character they choose to convey this is unquestionably a fabrication.  He is a creation stemming from heterophobia and paranoia in regards to masculinity.  The Colonel would rather kill his own son than allow him be gay which should alert every viewer that the film is utter propaganda  The last thing American Beauty wants to do is say something important about human nature.<br /><br />Just for the record, homosexuality is not something an officer in the Marine Corpswould find very earthshaking.  How could he given that the Colonel was immersed in a male only culture for the majority of his professional career?  Fitts probably had to first deal with it a month after his enlistment began.  I bet he would have gotten over its uniqueness by the end of basic training.  We will soon have more opportunities to judge this director's opinions as he has just finished making the film \\"Jarhead.\\"  I have no doubt that in it he  will more fully manufacture negative imagery regarding the world's most selfless soldiers.<br /><br />This horrendous portrait of suburbia never fails to disappoint.  A world that is steeped with narcissism, materialism, and constant sex is definitely an accurate snapshot of the mandarins dwelling in Hollywood, but it has no correlation with the great number of Americans who choose to live outside our major metropolises.r in the Marine Corps would find very earthshaking.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|\\"I'd swear that Shadows said his vocal chord damage wouldn't affect his voice in any way, but I guess saying that was a mistake.\\" <br /> <br />-hmmm, and i guess its just coincidence that they are not on hopeless anymore? <br /> <br />This is major record label trash.  For this Album A7X throw the heavy sound, the unique guitar riffs, and the screaming in the trash.  All of the guitar riffs (while still pretty crazy) are quite popppy, and extremely predictable.  Most guitar solos sound like a new found glory melody on steroids.  The drum is par...and the vocals are WEAK.  This is no hardcore, this is no metal, this is mainstream rock.  And I've come to believe that records like this are population control, because I feel like killing myself when i listen to it.   <br />This is not the first band to shame itsself with a crap release, produced by the idiots at warner bros who make them play this kind of garbage...nor, unfortunately, will it be the last.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood has to be one of the most unique and enjoyable films I've ever seen.  It includes exceptional performances by Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Martin Landau. In the title role, Depp is amazing and I'm not exaggerating in the least.  He made his reputation with us non-mainstream Hollywood fans for this one.  When you first see him on the screen, I'm sure you'll find an element of caricature in his portrayal of the angora worshipping Wood as he's sometimes simply too cheesy to believe.  Although, a cursory glimpse at the real director's movies will let you know that this is very much how he must have been given that he consciously created, again and again, so many reels of C movie refuse.<br /><br />As for Martin Landau, who plays Bela Lugosi, his performance practically steals the film from the effervescent Depp.  This great character actor certainly deserved his Oscar for this one.  It'll make you refute Bauhaus by screaming, \\"Bela Lugosi Lives!\\"  This was also the first, and last, time that I enjoyed the work of Sarah Jessica Parker.  She has some tremendously funny lines here: \\"You've surrounded yourself with freaks,\\" \\"Wood Productions, the mark of quality,\\" and \\"well, I see the usual gang of drug addicts and misfits are here.\\"  Lisa Marie is quite sexy as Vampira and more enticing than you could imagine.  Murray plays a gay named Bunny who longs to get a sex change but is thwarted during a hellacious trip abroad but brings a Mariachi Band home for consolation.  As for Wood, he is a cross dresser so I guess a good description of the picture on the whole could be, \\"Transvestite Chic.\\"<br /><br />Ed Wood a man with an endless supply of optimism and it wholly exists for no discernible reason.  He has no talent whatsoever, but he never let his inadequacy knock him down--at least for very long.  Lines like, \\"That's the worst film you ever saw?  Well the next one will have to be better\\" are typical of his reactions to adversity.  Wood's bizarre personality and childish enthusiasm makes one become attached to him whether you want to be or not.  In his own way, he is an honorable man as he stands by his friends regardless of the cost. Ed does more for Lugosi than any son could have.  His devotion to the has-been was touching.<br /><br />This film is hilarious at times, especially the scene involving the opening party for \\"Bride of the Monster,\\" which I replayed twice.  I'm still laughing!  In summation, it's sweet, full of spirit, and joyful which makes it incredibly easy to recommend.zarre personality and childish enthusiasm makes one become attached to him whether you want to be or not.

B0000039QA|5.0|This is one of if not the best rap cd i've ever heard. I'm not one of the people to just jump on the Biggie bandwagon when he died or Pac, this album along with Pac's \\"All Eyez On Me\\" is ALWAYS in my cd player there's not one bad song on this in my opinion and as far as who was better Big or Pac there's really no war at all between them and really neither one is better than the other. Big and Pac 4Life
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's new album is fabulous. It is a success from start to finish. This new CD is clearly better than their others. Every song is a potential classic. Not only have they given Rock a new flavor, but an interesting outlook. The grand sweeping melodies are triumphant. You become a legend when you record something that's memorable, that's unique, that's near perfect. And Coldplay is really making a name for themselves with their new record. They're no ordinary Rock band. The title of legend just might be in their future if \\"X&Y\\" is any indication. When I hear Chris Martin's voice soar over the piano on \\"What If,\\" I say, \\"Wow. These guys are really good.\\" Coldplay is no fluke. There is no flaw in this genius. \\"Twisted Logic\\" has to be one of the most interesting vocal and musical performances on the album. What's most amazing is how well Coldplay is able to manipulate their sound and still sound like Coldplay. They can vary something ever so slightly like \\"Clocks\\" vs. \\"Speed of Sound\\" and derive a completely different song, one that's better. Their sound is so flexible that it can take on almost any form and occupy any space. It can be almost anything to anyone. It's very interpretive. A CD I would definitely recommend.
B0007GADZO|1.0|I have to say that this is the only regular album Steve Vai has put out that I couldn't listen to.  The songs had good ideas, but his lead guitar work ruined it for me.  A lot of it sounded thrown together, and seemed more like showing off how many crazy notes he could put to gether than something that was orchestrated.  I've been a long time fan of Vai (since maybe '95) and I have every album he's put out.  This is the only one I had to get rid of.  I don't think it's a lack of talent...  just nothing grabbed me on it.  Try to find it used, if you're gonna buy it.  I sold mine for 1/3 what I paid for it.
B0009IW88A|4.0|Maybe it helps to be a Batman fan when experiencing this music, but either way, it sets an exceptional mood (that is, if you're in the mood for walking the streets of a cold, dark city with only your thoughts) Many reviewers here quip that there is no central theme to the new Batman, and while this is true, it also means that no one track rises above the others in its quality - after all, if you're looking for a hit single, go buy a NOW! cd. On the other hand, if you want some really fantastic instrumental music in a shadowy vein, try this out, and see the movie too, it also comes highly recommended.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Blow-Up, as the title suggests, is about the pictures.  David Hemmings is the photographer putting together a book about the down-and-out in London.  He decides to provide contrast for the end of his book by taking some shots in an idylic London park.  He sees in the distance Vanessa Redgrave holding an older man in what appears to be an embrace.  Hemmings begins photographing them and then is spotted by Redgrave who demands the negatives.  Hemmings refuses.<br /><br />Redgrave shows up later at Hemmings' studio.  He gives her what he says are the negatives, but we find out moments later he has kept them and proceeds to develop his pictures.<br /><br />The closer he looks at the blow-ups of his shots, the more intrigued he becomes with what he sees, which is a gun pointed at Redgraves' lover and then later a grainy shot of what may be a body.  Hemmings goes back to the park, finds the body, and then returns home.  Later his studio is vandalized and all his pictures are stolen.<br /><br />This plot line appears thin for a two hour film and many Amazon.com reviewers are bored to death with what they think is a pretentious movie about people impossible to like and a story bereft of action and dialogue.<br /><br />The Hemmings' character is impossible to like and that is just the point.  Director Michelangelo Antonioni is more interested in what Hemmings' camera sees, and that is a world invisible to the naked eye.  Hemmings' camera gives us frozen moments in time that are decisive moments in the lives of his characters.  Only by looking closely with great patience can we unravel the mystery of life and death played out in a park on a sunny afternoon.<br /><br />Blow-Up is a great mystery story and the mystery goes deeper than the murder in the park.  Can we trust what we think we see? Clearly not.  For those who would like to further their understanding of this question, I recommend Akira Kurosawa's great film Rashomon.  Can we trust what the camera sees?  Perhaps, but not from the long distance lense of Hemming's camera.  He needed to go back to the park to confirm what he thought he saw.<br /><br />Antonioni is a skillful director; he shows much and tells little, and he is careful to give us everything we need to make up our own mind. Our challenge to is see without prejudice, without projecting our own images and perceptions onto the blown-up pictures before our eyes.  Highly recommendederhaps, but not from the long distance lense of Hemming's camera.

1573226521|5.0|I first saw the movie on DVD a couple of weeks ago.  I found the movie extraordinary.  It was so beautiful, mesmerizing, and intense.  The plot, the casting, the acting, the scenery, the photography it all worked together seamlessly.  After reading everyone's reviews I just had to read the book.  You know the clich&eacute;: \\"If you liked the movie, you will love the book, it's so much better.\\"  Well, not necessarily in this specific case they are both excellent.  If anything, relative to their own medium the movie is a better movie than the book is for a book.  This does not mean the book is bad.  It is still outstanding.<br /><br />The book was great fun to read, and is an incredible page turner.  Actually, never reading fiction I am typically an incredibly slow reader (typically 35 pages an hour).  But, in this case I found myself cruising effortlessly at speeds close to or over 60 pages an hour.  And, I read the whole book (400 pages) in less than 3 full days, and that was during the working week.  That's definitely a personal best for me in terms of speed and pretty close to a best in terms of enjoyment too.<br /><br />The book has a fairly universal appeal.  I frankly don't have that much interest or respect in the type of dope addicted, hedonistic, vapid and meaningless culture described in the book.  Yet, somehow I could relate very much to the characters.  The plot was a complex mix of Robinson Crusoe, Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the Drifters (by James Michener).  It was the group dynamics, the power plays, the politics, and the hardship that made this story so interesting.  The protagonists faced wrenching moral dilemma days after days.  They are put in situations where they are no clear cut good or bad answers.  Sometimes given the circumstances, the apparently cruel thing is the right thing to do.  Most of the characters had few redeeming qualities by themselves, but as a society they became fascinating.  They became a representative microcosm of the entire of humankind.<br /><br />The writing is so hip, that at first it is almost irritating.  How many times can you read the four letter word in the same paragraph.  For a while, you almost question whether people really do speak like that.  But, the genius in the writing was that it was made to be adapted into a screenplay.  Voluntarily or not, Alex Garland created a magical cash machine when he wrote this first novel.  Twentieth Century Fox must have gone bezerk when they came across his story.  After this book, Garland did not rest on his laurels as he soon wrote \\"28 Days Later\\" which was turned into one of the best Armageddon horror movies I have seen in the past few years.<br /><br />As you can tell, I can unequivocally recommend the book and the movie as well.  Reading this book tempts me to read again both Robinson Crusoe and The Drifters.cosm of the entire of humankind.   <br /> <br />The writing is so hip, that at first it is almost irritating.

B0002ZEYYQ|5.0|<br /> <br />               I have always been a fan of Jamiroquai, all the albums they have come out with have been very good, but this record is just out of control. This album is just straight up funk makes you jump out your seat to dance music. I recomend this album to anyone that loves upbeat dancefloor music with quality lyrics. If you don't have this album do yourself the favor and get in the car and head to the nearest mall.
0312995423|1.0|This book has an OK beginning, but by the start of the rising action things begin to fall apart. It seems as though the only motivation driving the characters are misunderstandings among different groups; no one has any real incentive to solve the puzzles facing them. And the puzzles! I mean, this is supposed to be about the NSA's finest, solving difficult challenges which no mere mortal could surmount. I'm fairly certain that a middle-schooler who has yet to take algebra could easily answer any of these challenges. The final puzzle is so horrible, it's actively painful to read. I had to skip two whole chapters to keep from tearing the book apart. The puzzle took me about 30 seconds to solve, and at the time I read the book I was a high school student. It takes the \\"genius\\" protagonists over 15 minutes. What's even stupider is that, while the answer is blindingly obvious when seen through the lense of math or science, all of the math-science type people in the novel waste at least 10 minutes considering history-literature type answers. It's obvious that Dan Brown can only write one type of character, the art-history major, and that while his novels depicting art-history majors can be interesting (The Da Vinci Code), he should not be allowed to depict math or science of any form.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Back several years ago, a huge following came about for a virtually unknown band named Coldplay.  \\"A rush of blood to the head\\", their first major CD release was something that caught my attention.  Like most, though, it was the bands singles that made me want the cd.  Sadly, those two or three resulting singles WERE good, just not classics by any book.  Then you have X&Y, a cd that has dominated the charts on amazon.com for one reason only, critical praise.  Critics say oh, these guys are gonna be the next U2!  No, they aren't.  They can sale all the albums they want, but their music will still be boring and bland.  The only time you are going to want to sit down and listen to X&Y is if you are having trouble falling asleep.  This album is a sure bet to knock you right out... into a coma that is.  Apparently, some don't believe me.  It's your own fault if you waist your money on it, but take my word for it, it just isn't up to par.  Don't buy a cd because you saw the artist on the cover of a tabloid.  Don't buy it cause it is hyped up.  Coldplay shouldn't be hyped up at all, really.  I would suggest they hang it up, while they still can.
B0007OCG56|2.0|Although others will disagree with me, I found Spanglish as dry as burnt toast. There's literally no humor or romance, and the movie drags on for two hours without really doing much of anything. Tea leoni (Family Man, Jurassic Park 3) seems almost bored with the script, and Adam Sandler can't even hope to liven the dull boring moments that constantly shroud the movie.<br /><br />Want to watch a good romantic comedy with Adam as our star? Try Big Daddy or the Wedding Singer. Even Fifty first dates was better than Spanglish. Adam and Drew Barrymore definatly had more chemistry going than him and Paz Vega (Flor). As for Adam Sandler being a chef, or  his family delightfully eccentric. All I can say is \\"I so desperatly wish it where so.\\" Maybe the movie might have had more of an appeal. Otherwise, it leaves you with a huge sense of doubt.<br /><br />My advice? For what its worth rent this movie, or better yet try borrowing off a friend. Then if you like it enough buy it, otherwise you might have a big dissapointment in store. Even if you are desperatly crazy about Adam Sandler.
B000059TFO|4.0|I remember seeing this movie back in high school in RE (that's Religious Education for you folks who didn't have the 'privilage' of going to a strict Catholic Fundamentalist school) and thinking it was a pretty good movie. Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK, which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now. The other thing I remember was Trevor Jones' really cool-sounding Ry Cooder inspired score.<br /><br />Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists, one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago, 40 years after the crime, I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again.<br /><br />It's got a good story and is well acted, especially by Hackman, who is one of my fave actors (Dafoe is too but he's not in much these days). They play two FBI Agents, who don't get on (a popular clich&eacute; at the time), down in a backwoods southern town looking for three kids who have probably been killed by evil KKK members.<br /><br />The villains are despicable and Brad Dourif once again uses his wild eyes to great effect. But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.<br /><br />I was let-down by the ending and really wanted more red-neck, dirt-faced, hicka-billies getting their heads kicked in. And, judging from the recent televised court-case, attitude towards African-American's hasn't changed much since then. Which is pathetic.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 2.0 sound. There are no features and a Special Edition would be welcome.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is a movie that will have you either loving or hating it. Although not drop dead funny like the Santa Clause, Elf does have its moments.

Ed Asner as Santa is pretty cool, but no Tim Allen.<br /><br />Plot is pretty basic, Will Ferrel as a child crawls into santa's bag. Is adopted by the elves, and as he grows up begins to realize he's in a class of his own. So the truth comes out, and our hero (Or not) goes off to the magical land of New York to find his father. Who happens to be on the naughty list due to his cynical tactics in the work force i.e childrens books.<br />They pair meet up, and must deal with the differences of a chemically unbalanced elf, and a rather selfish-hard boiled father. Thrown into the mix of this self same elf falling in love and coping in an unfamilier world.<br /><br />Basic plot however funny and entertaning I found it. A truly enjoyable christmas movie, Will Ferrell is not to be missed. however rent it first. Right after watching The Santa Clause with Tim Allen, and you'll be sure to have an enjoyable holiday.
B00081U7HC|1.0|In response to another poster, the pre-release criticism not really about what is or is not on this disc. It's about the fact that studios want to milk the audience dry by re-issuing every DVD with new special features every few years. A movie comes out on DVD, people who liked the movie shell out money to own it. Fine. Then the studio comes along, throws in a few special features, re-issues the DVD, and expect people to buy it up too. Not just people who didn't own the original DVD, but those who did as well. And this time, not only have they done that once, they've done it twice! Put all the cards on the table; put all the special features on the first release, and then leave it alone. Stop trying to get the audience to pay for the same movie over and over. It's not just a question of what may be on this DVD, it's a question of why wasn't this all on there the first time. Why does this one need to be released three times, and when will it stop?
B000023VR6|5.0|great cd but i have to say not as good as the classic cd the cronic but its very close. 2001 has a buttload of good song on it.  my personal favorites are \\"the message\\",\\"forgot about dre\\",and\\"the next episode\\" but those are only a couple of the awesome songs on it. great cd a must have
B000002KET|5.0|This is BLACK SABBATH'S most brilliant and creative effort in their history. This has a more refined sound than their previous efforts. I think this is quite probably the best Metal album of all time. I remember in my earlier years, seeing this evil looking cover, and saying I'll never buy a satanic album like that, but look at the picture on the back, and it look's like God's angels are now with the demon possessed man, so I wasn't scared anymore. But when I got a little older, a lot of my friend's gave me an education on the band BLACK SABBATH, and for the last 25 years, they are one of my most revered and loved bands!!!!!!<br />As far as the content of this metal masterpiece, the only songs that kind of let this album down are &quot;Fluff&quot; and &quot;Who are you&quot;. Though if you don't compare them to the other tracks, their quite good. I'm blown away by &quot;A National Acrobat&quot;, &quot;Spiral Architect&quot;, &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;, and &quot;Sabbath,bloody sabbath&quot;.<br />If you are thinking of purchasing this disc, I would buy the CASTLE remasters, and not the Warner Brothers issue. The sound quality is better, and their are more liner notes. JUST BUY IT, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />p.s.- I came across an issue by the Japanese company Teichicu that's finally got the remastering right this time. The high frequencies are super crisp and clean. Try to look for that one here on Amazon. You won't be sorry you did.
B00005AQGH|5.0|amazing, amazing cd from the late tupac shakur great beats, great songs, great production as well.these are just a couple of my favorites i rated them to. bomb first (my first reply) 15.5, hail mary 10.5, to live and die in l.a. 5.5, and blasphemy 15.5  and thats just a couple of the kick ass songs on this cd you really have to go get this one if you're a fan of pac.
B00005JMCW|3.0|i don; like this movie because its not the original and it copied the other one with shelly long.its not as good as the original.
B0000039PW|5.0|what can i say about this cd,i say it was biggies best. now to tell you the truth i really didn't like biggies life after death cd, its not that biggie was bad in it but the people they  had featured in it sorta sucked. but this cd its freaking awesome if you like rap and you don't have ready to die in your collection then definetly go get this one, great cd.
B0007Y08QA|2.0|This movie--despite the hype you might hear to the contrary-is extremely boring-in fact I fell asleep watching it.  A sluggish storyline does not equal suspense.  I'll give Christian Bale credit for achieving the look of an anorexic released from a holiday in a concentration camp-it musn't have been an easy task--sort of a reverse \\"Super Size Me\\"    Later, after waking I finished the second half of this movie--the result was lackluster.  As a sidenote--a friend recommended this movie to me--I owe him!  Not much more to say--if you're having trouble getting a good nights sleep--this movie may be the cure for what ails you!
B00005JKCH|4.0|This version of the movie was refreshing, thank god for C.G.I yes! special effects,it was good to see spidey swinging with agility and stealth, Tobey Mcguire played his part to perfection his presence was definitely a plus for this movie however Kristen Dunst as mary jane ooooh please!!!!!! well of course i love William Defoe potrayal as the goblin, hey guy why the metal mask??? however he was excellent, this movie was balanced exciting and very true to the comic version, i alway say coversion from book to movie is legal rape!!!, this one was not so bad, it was a very believeble performance and would recommend it to any super hero lover this film make me say spidey any day laterzzzz folks...........
B00006CXXU|5.0|Okay, firstly, this was my first popular music purchase in a long time. As a little introduction, my cousin (who is younger than me and female) had this album and played it. Although I quite liked Christina's \\"Fighter\\" song, I didn't really think that I'd like anything else, as she is marketed (somewhat wrongly) in the cheesy pop category, similarly to Britney, Jessica, and all of that other trash. After I heard the originality of \\"Intro\\", I thought that I might give this album a chance, track 2 was okay, I quite thought the next track: \\"Walk Away\\", as with \\"Fighter\\", and I quite enjoyed the next few songs. I was suprised of the quality of this \\"music\\". Later that night I played this CD on my headphones (anti-socially) and really liked it and thus purchased a copy. The best songs are Loving Me For Me, Walk Away, and Keep On Singing My Song... and the Stripped Part 2 interlude is also very good.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I didn't think it could be done-the magic of Phantom captured on film. Schumacher pulls it off. The overture rings deep in your soul and causes your spine to tingle. The Phantom of The Opera song causes your imagination to soar higher than the Himalayas. Gerard Butler as the Phantom brings a deep, guttural soul to the angst driven character. Emmy Rossum has the angelic, mystical quality to take Christine straight to your heart.<br /><br />Schumacher's sequencing between past and present with the switch to grainy black and white gives the movie a vital quality which captures the faded glory of the era and the opera house.<br /><br />Not a lot that more that can be said-it is a movie and a musical that must be experienced.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|First of all, I have loved all system of a down albums, including their b-sides album that hardly anyone bought. <br /> <br />People on here are complaining about Daron's voice. No one can say his voice is more powerful or better than Serj's. But my favorite part about the vocals on their other albums was always when the two of them harmonized. And this album delivers more of that. Daron does not do most of the singing. He just does more. And seeing this album is his baby, it fits. He wrote the songs. He wrote the lyrics. His voice matches.  <br /> <br />How can anyone possibly listen to \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" and think Daron's voice doesn't fit? It's genius, its melodic, and it will put you into a trance.  <br /> <br />Serj has an amazing voice and can write some killer lyrics. But Daron has proved that he is more than just an absolutely mind-blowing guitarist. He can do it all, sing, write, and play some of the most incredible guitar in metal today. <br /> <br />This album is pure genius. I haven't grown to love it as much as Toxicity, but I am sure in time I will. People who don't love system of a down are either Republicans (thus automatically have no taste or ability to think for themselves), or people that can't stand any form of music that doesn't adhere to traditional \\"structure.\\" (aka boring) these people suck. Go back to listening to Puddle of Mudd.
B00092ZL80|3.0|If it does not have Maurice White performing, it is not EWF! This has got energy, as stated elsewhere, but I have never seen Philip Bailey's troup match the earlier Japan tour with the Master White himself. So this is white chocolate...good, but it ain't the REAL thing!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Superb send up of Kim Jong Il. This film is an endgame. Its a product of a society just bored with itself and everything its history has built itself toward. A society not going anywhere but trying desperately to steer clear of nowhere. The implicit criticism in the parody of the actors is particularly apt on this score. This film is a distillation of the inane, the stupid, the ignorant, and the bigoted insular idiocy of our society, precisely the characteristics of American society that bring about Anti-American terrorism in the first place. So what do we do with that distillation?  Just enjoy it.  Like the emporer Claudius said (as played by Derek Jacobi) let all the poisons that lurk in the night hatch out!! Let the poisons of nationalism, fear and crude understanding of the outside world just rise to the surface. Whether Parody or Policy that's all we have. This film is just genuinely very funny as well, like America will be decades from now. No wonder the rest of the world is starting to turn to China for a future indication of world leadership.  These film-makers should focus on a \\"Team-China\\" as a sequel and form the comedy around the independence of Taiwan.
B000002J1U|5.0|led zeppelin is a historic band and they oppened doors for many bands. As a super group they produced some amazing albums but in my mind there best were led zeppelin 3. <br />1 to 10, 10 being the best <br /> <br />immigrant song:10, the immigrant song is probubly the best way robert plant is remembered he was the top front man in the seventies and many people tried to go as high as him but i seriously dont think  its possible. <br /> <br />friends:10, the first and definently not the last acoustic song on this album and a very good one at that. <br /> celebration day:10 <br /> <br />since i've been loving you:7, after 1 1/2 albums of blues it gets kinda of old and doesnt really fit in the album but is still a very good blues song and would have fit well in there earlier albums. <br /> <br />out on the tiles:10, one of my favorites on the album if u don't like the other songs you should still buy it for this. <br /> <br />gallows pole:10, i recently saw robert plant perform this in concert its sort of slow song and takes some getting used to but once you get used to it its a gem. <br /> <br />tangerine:10, one of my favorite acoustic songs on the album its a awsome song! <br /> <br />thats the way:10, i also saw robert plant perform this one its very good but is kind of mellow <br /> <br />bron-y-aur-stomp:10++, my favorite song on the album the clapping and the guitar put together is sick! <br /> <br />hats of to (roy) harper: 9, another bluesy song, though i dont know what it is about because roy harper isnt dead..... <br />album:10+++++++!
0805076476|5.0|Loved this one. Also, check out JR KIndred's \\"Pattern Recognition\\" if you like novels like this!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is the best example of film noir that I have seen since The Coen Brothers' \\"Blood Simple\\".The film oozes menace from the opening scene. <br /> <br />The performances are terrific all round - especially Mickey Rourke as the brute with the heart Marv.It really is a marvellous character.It's a pity that the sequence involving his character doesn't last until the end of the film. <br /> <br />Other brilliant performances from the usually excellent Bruce Willis and British actor Clive Owen more than holds his own as well.Benicio Del Torro gives another great dark brooding performance. <br /> <br />It's also refreshing to see such a vast collection of beautiful actresses in the film as well.They are all gorgeous but deadly. <br /> <br />If you like surreal film noir with ultra violence but with a strange morality, you will love this film. <br /> <br />It's a great comeback from Rodriguez after the ridiculous over-the-top \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\".That film was a joke.At least in this film the laughs are few apart from a few black comedic moments. <br /> <br />Highly recommended indeed....
B0001611DI|5.0|George A. Romero achieved a cinematic feat by making Dawn of the Dead by telling a truly grotesque tale of flesh eating zombies.  The story in itself really is a suspenseful gore fanatic's dream where humor and entertainment jump out when least expected.  It is within the unexpected where Romero succeeds in generating a horror film that does not only frighten, but also creates much room for contemplation and reflection.  The combination of fear and existential philosophy develops an interesting opportunity for the audience to look at themselves in the mirror while light satire emerges through the reflection of American society.<br /><br />In Philadelphia exhausted employees of a TV station feebly try to convey what is happening on the streets.  An invited expert unveils the truth, but the interviewer deems it implausible that the streets are full of zombies devouring human flesh.  Despite the interviewer's doubtfulness he continues to question the expert while several employees begin to leave their posts.  In the middle of this chaos Francine (Gaylen Ross) tries to do her best in helping, but when her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge) arrives he tells her to meet him on the roof at 9PM.  She realizes it is high time to get out of the city before it is too late.<br /><br />At a different location in the city the police force has joined up with the National Guard in order to get control of the problem, but without much luck.  In one of the poor housing projects Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) bumps into Peter (Ken Foree).  They are two likeminded characters and realize that they might need each other in order to survive.  Roger invites Peter to come along, as his friend Stephen has a helicopter and they are leaving tonight.  Peter takes his chance with Roger and they leave the city of Philadelphia to its destiny with the living dead, as four of them fly out of the city.<br /><br />During their flight they stop for fuel and encounter more zombies, which forces them to reconsider their plan.  When they by chance fly by a shopping mall they take their chance to check out the place and if they can get some food.  After some exploration of the mall they realize that they have stumbled on what they think is heaven on earth.  Sure, they are fortunate, but it comes with a price, a very costly price.  At the same time, an interesting allegorical perspective of the societal values appear with death everywhere around them.  The value of items seems futile when they find out that Francine is pregnant, which makes them think about the future.  Those who have read Everyman can draw parallels between the Medieval morality play and the film.  For example, there is a scene where they find an abundance of money, but what is money when death is knocking on the door?  Riches do not matter, beauty does not matter, friends are about to run out, no kin exists, and the only thing that is left is the action they take and how they could affect the future - a possible hope.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect in the film is how they barrier themselves from zombies, but also possible visitors.  Here Romero touches on the basic idea of a government building, which is built on the idea of protecting one's territory.  This provides strong suggestions that humans are territorial, which is true when studying a world map.  The simplicity in which Romero applies this notion into an intriguing situation where fear is the constant that keeps them alive and what they have could help keep them alive for the time being.<br /><br />The film has some years on its neck, which means that the special effects are not up to the standards of 2005.  However, it still has its desired effect, and nothing of the story is lost due to the technical aspects of the film.  Besides the technical aspects Romero intendeds this film to be a sequel to his Night of the Living Dead (1968) and he surpasses the initial film by light years in both horror and wisdom.  The conclusive verdict of the filmis that Dawn of the Dead offers a truly remarkable cinematic experience that offers high level suspense in an insightful horror film.f the film is that Dawn of the Dead offers a truly remarkable cinematic experience that offers high level suspense in an insightful horror film.
B000957O82|3.0|Out of the clutter of other less-memorable romantic comedies in the recent past, I find \\"Hitch\\" to be somewhat refreshing.  Although the most of the story is nothing too original, the idea of a \\"date doctor\\" brings a nice little twist, and the cast delivers a decent performance.  Will Smith, memorable for his suave and arrogant characters in \\"Fresh Prince of BelAir\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\", had seemingly grown up in this movie.  He handles his \\"date doctor\\" character with not just easy-going humor but also maturity, something that isn't seen too often in his other works.  Surprisingly, the person that delivered the most amount of comic relief in this film is Kevin James' Albert Brenneman, a clumsy businessman who is desperate to win the affection of his beautiful and high-society client Allegra Cole, played by Amber Valleta.  James' performance is entertaining in his unabashed goofiness.  Without him the movie wouldn't have been as enjoyable. <br /> <br />I do have to agree with most people the ending and the way that it was set up was pretty weak.  When Eva Mendes' character dumps Will Smith based on a gross misunderstanding, it was somehow Smith's character who had to come begging in the end to win Mendes back.  It was unfair and unconvincing.  But otherwise, this is good bang for your buck if you want something light-hearted and romantic.
B0006399FS|5.0|O.K., I've read a lot of reviews about how U2 has sold out and is churning out mediocre stuff now, etc.  Whatever.  If you are mad that your favorite band is also the entire world's favorite, get over it!  I finally did-- it took me a while.   <br /> <br />First, my U2 bona fides.  I have loved them since about 1983, when I was transitioning into high school.  My mom bought me tickets for the Unforgettable Fire tour show at the L.A. Sports Arena and seeing them hooked me into their world.  I saw them 3 times in the 5 days they were in L.A. for the Joshua Tree tour in 1985 (believing at the time that if I suffered from hearing loss it was all worth it)-- again at the L.A. Sports Arena.  I also saw them headline the Amnesty International show at the Forum, and my sister and I started an Amnesty International chapter at our high school.   <br /> <br />But then they exploded.  Time Magazine cover, etc.  They went from selling out the 15,000 seat L.A. Sports Arena to selling out 7 days at the L.A. Coliseum which seated over 100,000!  That was when I started losing them-- Rattle and Hum seemed the ultimate in overexposure, and though I liked everything up to Zooropa (except for that whole Mephisto thing), I could not bring myself to buy Pop (and I still haven't). <br /> <br />So I was grown up and pretty much listening to a lot of other stuff, dislocated from my formative favorites. <br /> <br />Then came All You Can't Leave Behind.  This brought me back into the fold, just a great U2 album, with everything I liked and without the pretention.  Kind of like how I felt at the time-- these guys had been there, done that and had figured out how they wanted to be. <br /> <br />So now for How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  Like I said, U2 has figured out how they want to be, and they have taken the best of what they are and put it in every song.  Miracle Drug-- a classic.  Hopeful lyrics (I mean, who can not be moved and feel the strength of Bono singing, \\"Freedom has a scent/Like the top of a newborn baby's head\\"-- perfect!), Edge's screaming sort-of-solo like he always did, etc.  And I can finally listen to Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own without getting kind of choked up.  Every song is good.  I've been listening to this CD now for about 6 months now and still love it every time. <br /> <br />Bottom line-- great album; these guys are pros, and I can't wait to see them in concert again (after 20 + years) this October in Boston!
0451191935|5.0|The Bachman Books were a way for Stephen King to write a different style under a psuedonym.  Under the Richard Bachman pen name, King has managed to paint a bleak but realistic world (unlike the supernatural landscape of 'Salem's Lot and The Stand)).<br /><br />Rage:<br /><br />This book is about a young teenager named Charlie Decker.  He's like any ordinary kid but he has a problem.<br /><br />His childhood has turned him into an angry sociopath who's unable to cope with life and does the most drastic thing he could think of, he holds his Algebra class hostage.  Let the mind games begin!<br /><br />Long Walk:<br /><br />In a futuristic America, a totalitarian government has taken over.  To placate the population, a dictator known as The Major presides over a deadly game of endurance call The Long Walk.  100 teenage boys are selected to participate.  The winner gets set up for life, the rest are left for dead.<br /><br />Roadwork:<br /><br />A hard working joe who's life is turned upside down when his home is selected for demolition.  A sour relationship, a voice in his head and a new rifle make a terrible combination.  When the fuzz come around that's when the fun begins.<br /><br />Running Man:<br /><br />Another bleak tale about a media and consumer driven society (sounds familiar).  The growning have-nots are greatly out numbering the haves.  One of the many have nots (Benjiman Richards) decides to help out his sick child and part-time prostitute wife by becoming a Free-Vee games contestant.  Along the way, he learns and is tranformed into something he never thought he was capable of becoming.<br /><br />An awesome collection of short novels.  I higly recommended this novel.  You'll never regret it.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I think if you take about 3/4 of the \\"hard\\" CD, and about 1/2 of the \\"soft\\" CD, you got yourself a pretty great Foo CD.  No major leaps or bounds here, if you have been with Grohl since the beginning.  He's always had the hard/soft thing going, and this CD is no exception.   <br /> <br />There are a few throw-away tracks on each disk, but overall this is a solid effort.  I think the 1-2-3 punch of \\"In Your Honor\\" followed by \\"No Way Back,\\" and \\"Best of You\\" is a great opening.  On the second, \\"Miracle\\" and \\"On the Mend\\" (my personal favorite of the whole album) are the most heartfelt. <br /> <br />I still think The Colour and the Shape is his best, but these songs are new and good and won't disappoint anyone who likes these guys.
6302158249|5.0|I saw Dire Straits live in Canberra of all places, \\"On every street\\" tour in early 90's, they were supported by Hothouse Flowers (who were also very good I might add). It's not usual that a band of Dire Straits calibre comes to Canberra, they usually concentrate on the bigger cities, but I wasn't complaining.  It was a good concert, but not a patch on \\"Alchemy\\".  If I had one wish it would have been to be at this remarkable concert. Fortunately though, the video of the concert makes you feel as though you are there.  Every song is performed well, not just by the master Knopler who leads the band superbly but everyone else is also strong in their performance.   I've seen a number of live concerts - but this is the best I've seen without doubt...it's a masterpiece.   <br /> <br />The song selection is great, whether it be the appropriate intro of \\"Once upon a time in the west\\" through to the emotional closing performance of \\"Going Home -theme of the local hero\\". Of course \\"private investigations\\" and \\"telegraph road\\" are also inspiring. \\"Tunnel of love\\" is probably my pick, as hard as it is to single out any one song.  For good measure, they do a powerful rendition of \\"Sultans of swing\\" as one would expect.  For a concert that was filmed in 1983, I'm amazed at how good the quality is, in terms of sound and photography.   <br /> <br />I think if you were to ask the band members what was their greatest and most memorable live concert, I've no doubt they would recall with fondness, the \\"Alchemy\\" concert.  What a great band, and what a great memory for those who were lucky enough to be there in the audience.  I'm just hoping this will appear on DVD soon...
0783225733|5.0|A detailed and true description of the tragic malfunction of Apollo 13.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Bill Paxton all star and play wonderful roles during this account of Apollo 13.   <br /> <br />The movie brings the viewer into the lives of the three astronauts in space (Jim Lovell(Hanks), Fred Haise(Paxton), Jack Swigert(Bacon)) and shows how they deal and fix the problem that almost ended their lives.  It also shows how those on earth deal with the situation and how it engrossed most of the world.   <br /> <br />A true movie that is perfectly detailed and perfectly documented.  A definite must see.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I had to write this review because at the time of this review, there were 666 previous reviews (\\"Get Behind Me Satan\\"). So here I am Jack, either taking back my throne, or \\"getting behind you\\". The White Stripes are the greatest rock band of our generation, period (w/ Radiohead a very close 2nd). Every track amazes me, especially considering they have no bassist in the band. The depth Mr. White gets out of his guitar is unrivaled. This is rock-n-roll the way the founding fathers of blues and rock-n-roll envisioned. \\"Elephant\\" will be a classic the same way old Led Zep and Pink Floyd is 20 years from now. There is not one \\"skip to the next one\\" track on this album. Pure Genius.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|This was Dire Straits' first album. It is a classic. There are  <br />some great classic rock songs on this. The weakest song would be <br />In The Gallery. I think this goes great with Love over Gold, & <br />Making Movies, two of my all time favorite albums. And even better at the price, buy this along with Live at the BBC for live <br />versions of some of these songs.  <br /> <br />1. Down to the Waterline 10/10 Great album opener, this song rocks and is one of my favorites on this album.  <br /> <br />2. Water of Love 7/10 This song was a little too slow for me, <br />I think this is another track that I would skip after a while. <br /> <br />3. Setting Me Up 8/10 I can't really remember since I listened <br />to this. I think it's got some good guitar. <br /> <br />4. Six Blade Knife 10/10 One of my favorites on this album. In <br />addition to the live version, I recommend that they're both great. This is a track you can rewind like Down to the Waterline. <br /> <br />5. Southbound Again 8/10 This song is good but not the best on <br />this album. <br /> <br />6. Sultans of Swing 10/10 A Dire Straits classic! One of my favorites on this album. This was their first biggest hit before <br />Walk of Life, and Money for Nothing.  <br /> <br />7. In The Gallery 6/10 I think this is the weakest song on the <br />album. Mark Knopfler had too much of a high voice in this. Plus <br />maybe the worst DS song ever recorded. <br /> <br />8. Wild West End 7/10 I think the one on the BBC album was a tad <br />bit better. Still not one of the best. <br /> <br />9. Lions 10/10 This is the best song on this album! This song rocks! One of my favorites on this album. Great album closer, but <br />the live version on the BBC album is more greater.
B0009353IW|5.0|Having become a recent fan of the legendary Lalo Guerrero and after listening to his last CD called \\"Vamos A Bailar-Otra Vez! with Lalo Guerrero\\", I just had to hear this new disc with Ry Cooder, I was NOT disappointed! \\"Chavez Ravin\\" is almost as great as Lalo Guerrero's last CD. Ry Cooder has worked with more than his share of musical genius, Mr. Guerrero is certainly that, and is what moves and drives this outstanding project. Warning! - this CD will creat a need to buy more \\"Lalo Music\\". Mr. Guerrero's recent death in March 2005 at age 88 has created a great demand for his music, this seems to be the case with all genius. Discovering \\"Lalo Music\\" was quite a treat for me, and if your looking to open a new chapter in your musical experiences, buy this and also his high energy \\"Vamos\\" CD or for that matter anything else you can get your hands on from this great artist, you will NOT be disappointed. Mr. Lalo Guerrero will in time become one of the great American  songwriters of the 20th century!

B00092ZMDY|4.0|There are just so many groups that still have what it takes after all those years. Unfortunately, there really aren't that many who are still standing and making great live performaces from the 70's. Yet, The Eagles have really triumphed those storms several years ago with the last concert, Hell Freezes Over, and they have finally done it again recently with their farewell tour. Arguably, it is a shame the group will no longer tour anymore for their songs, because those songs are one of the very few cornerstones of music today. That has been shown, in a well-put concert worthy of the music.<br /><br />Eagles: Farewell 1 Tour: Live From Melbourne, is a remakrable double disc DVD concert which makes up for what was left behind from Hell Freezes Over. The compilation includes some great live recordings of great classic like Hotel California, I Can't Tell You Why, New Kid In Town, the soulful Desperado, and other great songs. Also like Hell Freezes over, a few new never-before heard songs were also premiered on this compiled live set. The songs here are lively, and still have a great feeling of bravado that the music never died. The DVD also features a couple of songs Don Henley and Glenn Frey performed from their solo efforts including Dirty Laundry, which Lisa Marie Presley recently covered, and You Belong To The City.<br /><br />Arguably, it is still a shame that The Eagles won't be touring anytime soon. There is just so much great material they've made over the years, and this live DVD package is a must have for all Eagles fans old and new. Arguably, this is truly one of the very few best DVD packages this year.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: A<br /><br />Mastering: A<br /><br />DVD cover: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+
B00005JNJT|4.0|which is not saying very much. Nevertheless, Batman Begins is an excellent action movie with an outstanding, star-studded cast. At the top of the billing is the credible Christian Bale, who, unlike his predecessors, is not so heavily typecasted from other roles that his suitability to play Batman/Bruce Wayne is widely called into question. In addition, the great Michael Caine lends a strong, supporting role as the debonair butler, Alfred, and the talented Morgan Freeman plays a powerful, pivotal role as scientist, Lucius Fox.    In terms of the story, the strengths highlighted are, arguably, also the weaknesses. When compared to the Burton/Schumacher packages, the movie does not rely on desperate, dark humor elements that try to keep the audience engaged. However, the writers evoke an often grim, stark Batman story whose character's origin and development settings are, by and large, quite different from the Batman comics many grew up enjoying, even loving.     Also, attempts to make the Batman a character that we can relate to by touting that he is essentially one of those few superheroes without innate or augmented superpowers are limited in scope. There is no argument with the following: unlike Superman, he cannot fly; in contrast to the X-men, he was not born with super-human or mutant abilities; and as a dissimilarity between him and those others (Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, etc.) who do not belong to the previous two categories, his powers were not derived from accidents or scientific experiments. On the other side of the coin, it is perhaps the portrayal of the non-superhero half that, ironically, makes Batman less tangible to many perceptions of our mortal frailties. Batman's alter-ego, the man known as Bruce Wayne, is a person who has internal conflicts as most of us do from time to time; so both Batman and Bruce Wayne are human in that respect. However, Mr. Wayne is a successful, philanthropic businessman whose safe and secure wealth is very central to the story and is at a level that at least 99.5% are unable to identify with. Even during the aftermath of the most adverse moments from the darkest of hours, victory is often attained by the use of gadgetries that we, by and large, cannot imagine possessing.     In consequence, one does not need to be reminded that Batman is extremely wealthy, and that almost leads the viewer to conclude that the \\"symbol\\" of Batman is essentially a by-product of one's mass fortunes. Many might wonder how someone of a less- privileged background or even of less-desirable physical endowments could possibly become larger-than-life in any capacity.    Upon careful reflection, however, if one thinks slightly outside the box and looks at the commonly perceived struggle between the classes from various angles, he or she can come to acknowledge that the character of Batman is the embodiment and extension of the greatest qualities of Bruce Wayne, who, though superwealthy, is not so blinded by his riches that he cannot see the blights and misfortunes others have had to endure. Even if one supposes that he is too wealthy to be a working-class hero in the purest sense, Wayne is, in the highest regard, a champion for the common people; for as Batman, he gives a voice and an added strength behind those who want to improve themselves and those around them.    Quite remarkable is that Mr. Wayne, with the positive influence of his butler, Alfred, grew up to acquire and maintain wise stewardship of his inheritance and would come to use his assets for the betterment of others. One might even draw parallels to the heroic biographies of notable American figures such as our early twentieth-century presidents (both Roosevelts come to mind), whose life stories entailed using resources to fight corruption or poverty, or both.    All in all, this is a movie that can be seen from a myriad of perspectives. If there is a unifying moral to this tale that might make one feel enhanced or enlightened, I would sayit is this: regardless of your background, you can use and develop personal traits within and without for the improvement of society. And that is, in my book, a very important lesson that we must all internalize.    Perhaps there a few minor scratches, but Batman Begins is a triumphant theatrical release. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.
076790592X|2.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a good book for many. It's easy to read and contains a powerful message about the importance of what's important in life. I was looking forward to delving in and discovering for myself what many others were praising.     However, about half-way through, I realized that there really wasn't much here. Just one man's journalistic perspective of another man's waning days. Yes, there is a message, and it's powerful--that we should be living each day with the acknowledgement that our days are limited--but, it's not a message unknown or unexplored. Here, however, it's done so predictably and without any heartfelt passion (get rid of the tape recorder . . . please!), that what you are left with is \\"Okay, next.\\"    Also, you get the sense that there is more of the author than should be, and that's not a good thing for this book. Here's an excerpt toward the end of the book:     \\"The oxygen tube was up his nose now. I hated the sight of it. To me, it symbolized helplessness. I wanted to pull it out.\\"     First of all, the fact that he even focuses on the oxygen tube is strangely unsettling in a moment like this, but not necessarily incongruous to the rest of author's analyses in the book; he does a thorough job of presenting himself as the  hard-driven, sports-minded male perhaps in search of some small measure of meaning, sensitivity, emotion, nostalgia, etc. Morrie, of course, does get Albom to cry a few tears in the end.     In addition, notice the simplistic prose of the passage. It's typical of the rest of the book. Albom does, however, aspire toward the literary with overworked and uninventive analogies, but ultimately fails.     I gave Tuesdays With Morrie two stars because I did like Morrie and some of the things he had to say. I guess the tape recorder was then good for something.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I was entirely fooled by the innocent \\"look\\" of the movie. There should be a warning on it for parents. I am sure many families have accidently rented this for their children. It disguises itself as a Childrens movie which it is not. Don't expect your child to retain any last shred of innocence after seeing this movie.    There is some decent slapstic comedy here, some of it original, some overused (such as a long vomit scene), much of it unecessarily offensive, violent, and abusive. Too bad, the producers have talent that could have made a quite enjoyable movie with more mature editing. Unfortunately that did not happen.    I would not have made it through half of this movie except I was fascinated by the social implications of a movie like this being \\"mainstream\\". In that way this movie was indeed interesting, but also disturbing.
0780629450|5.0|..In this adaptation of Hamlet he is indeed a magnificant bugger. I was fortunate enough to catch this movie first-run on a 70mm print on a large screen - and was simply stunned by the vision. Full-text  Shakespeare, with a bevy of characters portrayed by a bevy of characters (some to critical boo-hooing) in an equally turbulant if not literally correct era, 1996's Hamlet is surprising, and refreshing. Although some purists debate the usefulness of Mel Gibson's Hamlet, he made Shakespeare accessable to the masses who fled in memory of high school literature class - Branagh's Hamlet is for those who moved on from Gibson's, and even for those who loved Shakespeare long before The Road Warrior took on The Bard.    With glee I read of Warner Brothers FINALLY releasing a remastered DVD in time for the 10th Anniversary of the movie's film debut, on January 10 2006. Never able to afford the LaserDisc copy of the full-text version, and too much a snob to stoop to VHS, I look forward to owning Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet once and for all.    Read the saga of an ambitious fan-movement to have this movie released to dvd at:  (...)
B00005QDW1|1.0|I bought this CD because these people seemed better than all the other alternative rock bands that I've heard (which are horrible!).  But I DO NOT love it.  I said that at first, but that must have been wishful thinking.  Alternative rock is NOT my type of music.  Here is a review of all the tracks so you'll understand better what I think of this band.  <br />Intro - I always skip this track, there's no point to it.  <br />Hella Good - The jumpiness in the rhythm and the boringness in the melody make it not a song I enjoy.  <br />Hey Baby - The songs I listen to from the mid-twentieth century never have banging in the background.  <br />Making Out - The fact that part of this is really spoken instead of sung makes it even worse than it would be otherwise.  <br />Underneath it All - Nice song.  At least it would be so if there wasn't as much going on with the instruments.  <br />Detective - Way to fast and loud for me.  <br />Don't Let Me Down - One of the most rocking songs on the album.  Not a quality that I would choose for a song. <br />Start the Fire - A strange title for the sound of the song.  <br />Running - Pretty sweet, it's one of the slower songs.  It doesn't really need that many instruments, though.<br />In My Head - Melody is catchy but ugly.  <br />Platinum Blonde Life - Worst song on the album.  Annoying and very rocking!  <br />Waiting Room - What a strange beat!  I can't believe any song could have a beat like this.  <br />Rock Steady - Tone it down with the bass!
0143034901|3.0|Ths is a 200 page story told in 500 pages.  The book drifts aimlessly, and is driven primarily by coincidences and parallel stories that are so heavy-handed as to be slightly embarrassing.<br /><br />The main character ages from 12 to 18, but always speaks with the voice of a middle aged man.<br /><br />The idea that you have to find your own life in the search of another's is a well-worn, but useable idea.  In my opinion, the masterpiece of this genre is \\"The book of Illusions\\" by Paul Auster.  If you've read Auster's work, then The Shadow and The Wind is, as the title suggests, long-winded and rather vaguely defined.
B00005UW47|1.0|Let me be honest with you.  The music on this CD is NOT good.  NONE of the music nowadays is good.  The songs on here don't have interesting melodies.  Songs of genres like rap don't even have melodies.  And in all other genres of new music (e.g. pop, R&amp;B, rock) the melodies of the songs are either boring or ugly.  If a song that is popular these days has a catchy melody, it's a catchy UGLY melody.  Melodies have to be nice to be enjoyable, like in classical music.  Here is a simple rule: For music to be good, it has to first of all HAVE a melody, and second the melody has to be catchy and NICE (NOT UGLY)!
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles' sixth album, \\"Rubber Soul,\\" saw the Fab Four push the bar up once more, continuing their growth as songwriters and musicians, experimenting more in the studio, and pull away some more from the simpler boy-meets-girl pop songs they started with and into more sophisticated avenues. The love songs are still there, but the lyrics have more weight and maturity than ever before. \\"Rubber Soul\\" has more of an acoustic feel to it than any previous Beatles album, but the band still plug in often enough. And the music is wonderful. In short, it's another masterpiece for the Beatles! Classic songs include Paul McCartney's pop-rocker \\"Drive My Car,\\" the beautiful ballad \\"Michelle,\\" and the fun \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" and John Lennon's gorgeous compositions, including \\"Norwegian Wood\\" (featuring sitar by George Harrison), \\"In My Life\\" (with a lovely piano solo by producer George Martin), the soaring \\"Nowhere Man,\\" and the dreaminess of \\"Girl.\\" George Harrison contributes a pair of terrific songs, \\"Think For Yourself,\\" and, my personal choice for the all-time best song Harrison ever did with the Beatles, \\"If I Needed Someone,\\" which is an absolutely radiant, sparkling number. And Ringo Starr gets a great spotlight tune with the country-ish \\"What Goes On\\" (and for which he received a rare co-writing credit with Lennon & McCartney). The Beatles' musical evolution gloriously continues with \\"Rubber Soul.\\"
0780626494|4.0|\\"Blast from the Past\\" is a consistently funny film about a man who was born in a fall-out shelter in the San Fernando valley living with his parents until coming out when he is 35.  A majority of the film's laughs derive while they are underground oblivious to the changes that have gone on.  This can be credited to the performances of old pros Christopher Walken as the eccentric professor and Sissy Spacek as his wife.  The laughs are less sporadic when Adam (Brendan Fraser) emerges from the shelter though Dave Foley gives a good performance as Alicia Silverstone's gay friend, a character type that has become cliched but Foley transcends that.  The film can also be faulted for overlength but on the whole the laugh quotient is pretty high so I recommend it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|All and all I think this movie is Essential Monty Python, The mocking of King Arthur as one reviewer put it is quite inspired along with the scenes of them taking on The Black Beast and the Killing Rabitt. the Castle scene with the maidens and Richard the Pure, I find many reasons to recommend it, though some may find the absurd humor of the English a bit over the top
0670033375|5.0|The depth and breadth of Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" is awe inspiring.  He manages to cover modern Montana, Easter Island, Mayan Civilization, the Netherlands, ancient Vikings, Modern China,  and a host of other societies.  He discusses the impact of man's actions on the environment, and the impact of the resultant environmental degradation on human societies.<br /><br />At the same time as he discusses the findings of archaeologists and historians, he analyzes the scientific factors, and evaluates the various levels of political response.  He believes strongly that people can choose how to respond to environmental degradation, and death or survival results from those choices.<br /><br />The last chapter brings together all the identified causes of societal collapse and argues that we can make a difference, but we must rise to the challenge.  And, he makes clear how globalization prevents us from being able to see societies in isolation.<br /><br />This book is a dense read, and it is packed with details about each of the societies discussed.  The last two chapters are more of a political tract.<br /><br />I did not find every chapter to be equally enthralling.  And, I'm certain that the attempt to fit the information into the thesis probably leaves a lot for experts in the history of each of the covered socities to argue with.  Any book that attempts to weave together such a range of subject matter is going to be rife with overgeneralization.  Nonetheless, this book is immensely thought provoking.<br /><br />For me, this book did not read as compellingly as \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\"  Nonetheless, it is a remarkable book.  Highly recommended.
0060763280|2.0|The truth is in the middle. On the one hand, \\"T. Harv\\" (c'mon, get a real name) provides a lot of hype and flip discussion. He quotes the \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" book to make his points about saving money and spending wisely. Then he'll talk about buying the \\"marked price\\" item on the menu and avoiding the \\"value\\" chicken dish so as to develop a \\"millionaire mindset\\". Yet I've read the \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" and that is EXACTLY how those millionaires did it....eating chicken, driving Fords and buying $199 suits.  <br /> <br />I will give \\"T. Harv\\" some credit in that he does point out that people often don't think large enough. Sometimes the answer IS to grow yourself larger than a problem. He does a good job of pointing this out. <br /> <br />His love for \\"network marketing\\" (Tupperware parties) seems out of date. Are there REALLY still people making good money doing that? C'mon, with internet and Ebay that era is OVER. For the average guy, the odds of \\"starting a business\\" and \\"making it big\\" in that business are slim. Sure, it CAN be done, but the post WW2 \\"millionaires next door\\" who had shoe stores, corner markets, carpet stores and tire stores cannot be replicated. Try opening a carpet or shoe store today against Walmart!  <br /> <br />Again, good motivation and good points about growing your way out of problems. But overall the book was not reality and he is selling hype. It's hooey.  <br />
0062502182|4.0|I read this book on a recommendation from my wife, who enjoyed the book quite a bit.  This is not a deep, intellectual and weighty book. But the idea of pursuing your Personal Legend is interesting, and this theme is well played out in the novel.  If you are interested in a positive, well-intentioned book for some light summertime reading, give it a shot.  If you are looking for the meaning of life in this book, you might want to look elsewhere.
B00005NVDF|5.0|This is my favorite Woody Allen movie.  It began as a successful play, and Woody loved it in that format so much he was reluctant to make it into a movie.<br /><br />It must have been one heck of a play, because it's an outstanding movie.  I'm sure glad he made the movie, and made it well.  Now it's available to a much wider audience.  Don't pass up an opportunity to see it.
B00005K9QP|2.0|Eric Clapton plays some nice leads on this CD. I wish he was doing the vocals. I don't know where John Mayall ever got the idea that he could sing. It wasn't from me. I was playing his music in a blues/rock band all the back in 1969, and I have always wanted to say that. There......I've said it!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|Or something like that. I just know his voice has a rich warm character that melts me. When I first heard him, the DJ was all \\"I almost cried the first time I heard this\\" and I was all \\"whatever\\" but then he played Goodbye My Lover and it sounded so unique. (And it wasn't because it was recorded in Carrie Fisher's bathroom.) He's sorta Kat Stevens. And his song, \\"You're Beautiful\\" wins my award for best annunciation of the word \\"f--king\\" in a song.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|I am a Natalie Portman fan and I don't even know why. No,I don't think she's a great actress but there's something about her screen presence and otherwise that makes me want to commit into watching all movies involving her.My favourite scene in Star Wars III was one involving her in a lowkey mood.Getting back to my review,<br /><br />Closer is a movie I expected a lot from.With an awkward star cast comprising of Jude Law,Julia Roberts,NP and Mr.Ugly Arthur I wondered where all this could end.The movie starts in an usual bemusing way that leads me into beleiving it's a dreamy film. There are certain chain of events and the director of the movie relies on the viewer's prudence to make a story of it's own.What I liked about the movie was the photographing session lasting 5-10 mins between Roberts and Law.The UK Chat session was pretty interesting too.Mind you,that's about it.<br /><br />Maybe it was the starcast and how they were played together or maybe it was the weak script.Or maybe it was both.I admire films for their spark of entertainment. Closer bored me with it's bitterness it never gets out of.<br /><br />PS - I am not in a relationship as of now. I found the plot and some of the extensions extremely boring. I would recommend this to someone who's as hard to win as me and \\"must see a film he/she wants to see\\"
B000002KDX|4.0|Although this album can be criticized for being a CSN& Y imitation (what fans often seem to forget), it's still a very good LP, standing the famous test of time. There's something  magical in the song Horse With No Name, the most imitative song of the whole (it could really be Neil Young), that makes it one of the best songs of history. But the other song I find moving is Pigeon Song and I wonder why every lover of this album seems to agree that it is a weak song. The text and the way that DB sings it (not far from Cat Stevens style) create a malaise. Sorry but for me, it's the other highpoint of the album.
B00062ZE3U|3.0|After hearing wave upon wave of praise about Within Temptation I finally decided to buy one of their albums.  Unfortunately, Silent Force is just another case of a band failing to live up to their hype.  They have a great singer, but thats where the talent ends with this band.  Cliched choral backings, dime-a-dozen riffs, and droning synths just don't make for a very good album.   The sound Within Temptation goes for is one that has been played to death for last few years.  Why everyone seems to think the novelty of having a choir is an adequate substitute for compostion skills, I don't know.  Take away the choir and Silent Force is really nothing more than a glorfied Evanescence with a slightly better singer.  A harsh comparision, but one I feel is justified nonetheless.  A good singer, though not a bad thing to have,  doesn't make or break a band.  Which is why I think Within Temptation are sub-par.  I know I'm probably in the minority with this opinion but I don't really care.  I'd recommend checking out Alas-Absolute Purity and Leaves Eyes-Vinland Saga instead of this album.  <br /> <br />

B0002858YS|1.0|This album is crap. Another album made specifically for teenage girls to droop over. Not a bad way to make cash but I wouldn't disgrace myself writing crap like this. First, the guitarist is just terrible. He's barely noticable and might as well not have been there. This is barely in the \\"rock\\" genre. The singer might as well have just sung over a DJ and called it pop. Second, the singer is horribly bad. His lyrics are moronic, cliche and the theme of his lyrics is used in almost every song. Yea, yea, you couldn't get a girl, blah, blah, blah. I can literally say \\"sing a new song\\". His singing is pretty bad too. Any 20 year old guy could sing the way he can, so why does he get so much attention? Because he's willing to conform to style that soo many people love. The Killers is nothing more than a retro boy band designed to look like a rock band to sell more records. It IS specifically targeted at teenage girls, after all, they buy the most CDs. This crap wasn't worked on. All I noticed was a tune played within a 10 second period and repeated for 3 minutes.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney's fourth CD is BY FAR her worst CD to date. Instead of getting better, she keeps getting worse. I only like about half, if that many, of the songs on here. Here is a review of the songs: <br /> <br />1. \\"Me Against The Music\\" - I love this song! It is one of my favorites! The beat is fun, its fun to sing along to, and its fun to dance to.  <br /> <br />2. \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" - Not one of the best but still okay. The beginning with the Ying Yang Twins before it gets to the main part of the song is SO annoying; I really wish that part had never been put in it. Otherwise, this song is just alright, nothing overly special. <br /> <br />3. \\"Showdown\\" - This also is not one of my favorites. It is too racy and gross: \\"Never thought I'd see you like this/You're lookin' good when you're half dressed/Just let me give you one last test/Is that a sin? No//I don't really wanna be a tease/But would you undo my zipper please/Uh uh, please don't talk/Listen/I'll let you touch me if you want/I see your body rise, rise\\". This is one of the most disgusting songs she's ever sung. <br /> <br />4. \\"Breathe On Me\\" - Another bad song and too sexual. I hate that mostly all she does now is really overtly sexual songs. \\"And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there/...Two bodies synchronising/...Breathe on me, yeah, oh/Baby, just breathe on me\\". <br /> <br />5. \\"Early Mornin'\\" - This song is okay. It is not too overly sexual, but it is still not that great. It's about a girl out clubbing and then hooking up with a guy and staying with him until the early morning. Nothing that special. <br /> <br />6. \\"Toxic\\" - Finally, another good song on this CD!! LOVE this song. Most people have heard this song! A girl so in love with a guy that she's addicted to him.  <br /> <br />7. \\"Outrageous\\" - This song is okay but all the times \\"outrageous\\" is said gets a little too annoying. The chorus is a little long and every other word is \\"outrageous\\". Nothing special. <br /> <br />8. \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" - HATE, HATE, HATE this song! It is WAY TOO DISGUSTING!!! \\"Another day without a lover/The more I come to understand/The touch of my hand...I'm all in my skin, and I'm not gonna wait/I'm into myself in the most precious way...I shut myself out from the world so I/Can draw the blinds, and I'll teach myself to fly\\". Definitely skip-worthy. <br /> <br />9. \\"The Hook Up\\" - This song is another just okay song. Nothing that special. Just people hooking up. <br /> <br />10. \\"Shadow\\" - Another good song finally. One of my favorites. A girl misses her boyfriend and thinks she keeps seeing him, but it is always only his shadow. <br /> <br />11. \\"Brave New Girl\\" - Another good song! It's about a girl finally being brave enough to move outside of her \\"comfort zone\\" and chase after what she wants. Good message about being brave. <br /> <br />12. \\"Everytime\\" - Another good song! Great choice for a single! Nice and slow and very good! It's about a girl wanting her boyfriend back with her and feeling bad without him. \\"Everytime I try to fly I fall/Without my wings/I feel so small/I guess I need you, baby/And everytime I see you in my dreams/I see your face, it's haunting me/I guess I need you baby\\". Very sweet and wonderful! <br /> <br />13. \\"Me Against The Music (Remix)\\" - Good song! The beat is a little different, and it is just as good as the original! <br /> <br />Overall, this is an ok song with almost all the good and non-sexual songs at the end. I wish the good songs were more spread out, and I also wish that there were more of the better songs on here. Avoid the songs like \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" and \\"Showdown\\". The best songs and good songs are \\"Me Against The Music\\" (Original and Remix), \\"Toxic\\", \\"The Hook Up\\", \\"Shadow\\", \\"Brave New Girl\\", and \\"Everytime\\".  <br /> <br />

1559409002|5.0|I saw this movie last night, and I was truly amazed at how GOOD it actually was!!! The B&W transfer looks amazing and 100% clear, except in a few spots, and it was really exciting. It has a sort of twilight zone feel to it, and the organ carnival music throughout the whole movie was so eerie. Candace Hilligoss, who plays Mary Henry, did an excellent acting job, even for a B-Film. She is an amazing actress, and deserved an Oscar for her riveting performance as Mary Henry. I reccomend this movie to everybody, and would also like to thank Criterion for giving this awesome film such a beautiful treatmant.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Did I think it possible? Heck no! I don't consider myself a big theater-goer, but when I do go, I expect nothing short of at least GOOD. What I got from Batman Begins was nothins short of fantastic. This movie is extreme! The script is great, Christian Bale is awesome, the villain is an ultimate bad guy (no crazy colorful costumes or cheesy dialogue come from this villain!), and the movie balances action with actual substance.  <br /> <br />In Batman Begins, we learn the origins of Batman. It opens with our hero, Bruce Wayne aka Batman, in a prison. He gets into a wicked fight with a group of inmates, so bad that the guards pull him off telling him it's for \\"protection.\\" When Bruce screams that he doesn't need protection, the guards tell him that it's for the other inmates, not for him. Bruce is a strong-willed, heck just plan strong, man. Soon after, he's picked up by Ducard (Liam Neeson), who trains Bruce to become a member of an elite group called The League of Shadows, but when Bruce's initiation consists of killing someone and he just can't do it, he ends up setting the entire place on fire, stopping only to save Ducard. Bruce heads back to Gotham City, sure that he can be of help to the people. And undoubtedly, he will be exactly the force that the city needs. The city is full of corruption, from the police to the lawyers to the creepy guy, Scarecrow, who runs the mental institution. One of the non-corrupt is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), who is fighting to put the city's biggest mob boss behind bars. Rachel knew Bruce Wayne before his parents died and is upset to learn that his return to Gotham has no more substance than being a playboy (oh, how little she knows...) <br /> <br />It's great to finally have backstory. To finally have more than just a couple glimpses of how Bruce Wayne actually became Batman. His greatest fear is bats; what better way to get over the fear than become a bat? There's still comedic one-liners, though it's nothing near as cheesy as the previous films. One of my favorites is when Bruce is trapped under a fiery log and his butler Alfred (played wonderfully by Michael Caine) says, \\"What's the purpose of all those push-ups if you can't even lift a bloody log?\\" So, the cheese factor is finally gone from the Batman franchise. If they continue with making Batmans, which I'm sure they will, I hope they take notes while watching this one to create something equally spectacular.
0786259795|5.0|Although &quot;The Fort&quot; (Fort Meade, home of the legendary and most secretive National Security Agency) seems to be at the thematic center of this book, the author, a member of the high-IQ Mensa society, is at least as much interested in humanizing the male and female protagonists (both of whom have IQs that would dwarf those of plain vanilla Mensans) as in the maze-like nuances of abusing code making and code breaking in the computer age. <br />True enough, the opportunities for rogue activities abound in the &quot;black world&quot; of cryptography -- and, plausibly, they might even extend to the highest reaches of the organization whose mission was so sensitive that even its acronym remained classified until very recently. <br />Clearly, the author risks treading on the sacred, potentially killing ground that he fictionally represents. Indeed, the author claims to have been informed of details about the NSA by two trusted aficionados of the secret world. <br />He did not need to acknowledge these sources since his fictional work is harmless fun -- only interesting to the crypto lords and wizards, perhaps, for its recruiting potential (and NSA is facing a crisis of personnel as perhaps never before in its history). <br />Yet the games presented in the Fort -- and in the field -- to complicate the mystery and to bring it to a literarily satisfying conclusion have a pattern too, and for those interested in trying their mastery of the black arts, a coded message is included. <br />The pattern and play of the work do suggest that high spirits and thinking &quot;on the fly&quot; are still valuable -- Cold War or none! I enjoyed this book great, but try it for yourself. Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- very much on my mind since I purchased a &quot;used&quot; copy off Amazon is &quot;The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition&quot; by Richard Perez, an unconventional, weirdly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.
B00012BD0S|5.0|My personal favorite Symphony X album. Good stuff from start to finish. I highly recommend this album. <br /> <br />I'm not going to go into attempts to sell potential new fans on Symphony X. Its your loss if you dont check them out.
B000286SCO|5.0|5 Years in a Live Time surely was a good documentary/concert dvd, with enough live presentations, rarities and video clips to enjoy. Now with the extra addition of the always-wanted-in-dvd-format Images and Words Live in Tokyo this pack becomes a must for the collectors and DT fans, and a great presentation card for those interested in knowing this prog-metal band. Most important, you'll never get bored with these Dvd's, watch'em over and over.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is an incredibly rich and challenging movie to watch and devour.  It has breathtaking cinematography, convincing actors, as well as a well-developed theme in story.  Filmed in some of the most exotic Middle East locations (the locations appear almost as though no one travels through them), the film is about Lawrence's effort to help the Arabs (many of whom are played by non-Arabs) obtain self-determination from the Turks.<br /><br />Although the movie is quite long -- four hours (I was unable to watch the entire movie in one sitting), it is certainly well worth watching.  You will feel as though you have gone through history, visited these incredible sites (without having to go through the pain of visiting them), and have come back with a lot of insights into human nature.  This is a high quality film.<br /><br />Michael
B00080ZG10|1.0|Sure, this film looks great, but the costumes are NOTHING compared to the other costumes in films that were nominated at the Oscars, and the acting SUCKED. This is by far the worst, most boring, dull, and waste-of-time film i have ever seen!!! I dont know what the critics were all hyped up about. The only GREAT thing this movie has is the plane crash, and that is what i'm giving it one star for. Otherwise, this movie deserves NO stars, and I reccomend it to NOBODY. I simply cannot believe the critics HATED the Phantom of the Opera, but loved this!!! In a world of true justice and jurisdiction, this film would be put in the back room of every Blobkbuster so nobody would have to even look at the cover when they passed the \\"A\\" section. HORRIBLE MOVIE.... all this movie is, is BORING CRAP!!!!!
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is easily the best super hero film ever made, and possibly one of the Top 10 movies of all time. If the Joel Schumacher installments accomplished anything, it's that they paved the way for WB to blow up the franchise and start over. I was a HUGE fan of the first Batman when it came out (I was 13) and this movie makes it look like a joke. <br /> <br />The most refreshing aspects of the movie is its realism. Portraying Gotham as modern day America, rather than some gloomy comic nightmare, or a neon-riddled discotheque draws us drawn into the action like we haven't been before. Complimenting this direction perfectly were the understated performances of the actors. It was nice to see villains that could exist in real life. I was worried going into this that there were too many story lines -- aside from how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, there is the love interest with Katie Holmes, and all the villains: Scarecrow, Raj Al Ghul, Carmine Falcione, the Chairman of Wayne Industries... would these all bog down the story the way they had in the past? Are these villains for villains' sake? I glad to say they work perfectly together, and it's not overwhelming in the slightest. I was also relieved they put the romance on the back burner, and Katie Holmes primary role in this movie is to be on the posters and in the trailers, where she looks fantastic. <br /> <br />Christian Bale was superbly cast as the billionaire playboy with a dark secret to hide, complete with two references to infamous lines in American Psycho -- 'inside doesn't matter', 'my mask of sanity is about to slip'. Cillian Murphy gives Nicholson a run for best villian ever - I'm not exaggerating, he's incredible, even in the few minutes of screen time. Morgan Freeman is fantastic as a scientist who has been run through the corporate grinder and ended in the basement of Wayne Industries. Liam Neison plays the most interesting character in the movie, and probably put this movie over the top for me, and cemented itas one I will never forget. <br /> <br />In a brilliant subtext of the movie they use Wayne Manor and as euphemism for the Batman franchise. This was very entertaining, and rare to see in an action/adventure movie. <br /> <br />For what a movie is supposed to accomplish, Batman Begins may hit the mark sharper than any movie ever made. It is one of the most engrossing, entertaining, creative, and smartly written movies of it's genre - but more importantly, the expectations have been driven so low over the past 15 years, they had a monumental task is restoring credibility to a character that for all intents and purposed has been delegated to Ace & Gary references on SNL. <br /> <br />It was just nice to leave the theater after watching a Batman movie without having to convince myself that I liked it. It's also nice to see that the 13 year old kid that collected all the Batman baseball cards, and talked to his best friend for months leading up to June 23, 1989... trying to figure out the exact plot of the movie with information taken from Rolling Stone, behind the scenes interviews with the cast, and excerpts from Batdance... that kid was on to something. <br /> <br />I was just a couple decades premature, is 'all.
B00062IVKI|4.0|THE STORY MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT HIS DVD VERSION HAS EXCELLENT VIDEO AND AUDIO. I RECOMMEND IT FOR SCORSESE FANS!
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is heavier than all their previous albums. Michael Romeo really shines in this one. The sound is more raw too. This is a must for Symphony X fans and just fans of metal in general. <br /> <br />I'm not going to go into attempts to sell potential new fans on Symphony X. Its your loss if you dont check them out.
B0002EXH5E|1.0|I just read some reviewer's opinion saying that he loves this album because he is a Megadeth fan , and THEN a metal fan.  <br />To me his opinion seems like a big contradiction, because we, as fans, like a band not because of the lifestyle they have or the nice kids they grow, we are fans of what they \\"sell\\", and that is their music. So, if you're a fan of a certain group, and they release and awfull album, don't say \\"Ok, i'm gonna change my taste just because this band was my favorite and they rocked, so this albums must be great but i can't see that\\". Come on, this album sucks big time, the music, the lyrics. All of it. <br />This album is boring and pointless, not just for having less metal on it, but mainly because it shows no innovation and no real intention in its music.
B0002WZTOI|1.0|What can I say about Top Gun?  This is an over the top movie that is replete with lousy acting, slipshod story writing, and is wanting in creativity, style, and quality.  Perhaps it is because this movie is 20 years old that much of it appears to be outdated, but it does seem as though there could have been more improvements.  Of course, CGI technology was not as advanced back then, so it is hard to hold the movie to such a high standard.  Perhaps the worst part of Top Gun are the hackneyed lines that are contained throughout the movie.  The lines could have been written by any immature 13-year-old boy with a lot of spare time on his hands.  Although the creators of the movie obviously intended the movie to be timeless, they did a very poor job of it.  This is the worst military-oriented movie ever created.  For those seeking a higher quality military movie, I highly recommend Full Metal Jacket.
B00005HGR1|5.0|This CD is made in Japan with no bonus track <br />Japan CD has the highest standard in the world. <br />BTW I am not japanese, But I have to admit that <br />so someone who want a better quality CD can buy this one <br /> however, you can buy the gold CD which is tooooo expensive~ <br />this is not a bad choice
B0006GQMC8|3.0|While Banff National Park has long been a favorite destination of celebrities, this was one of the first motion pictures to be filmed in the burgeoning town of Canmore, Alberta.  The list now includes 'Last of the Dogmen', 'Mystery, Alaska', and 'Snow Dogs'.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Most of the reviews have hit the nail on the head.  Denzell's performance is almost as true to life as an actor can get.  My sister disagreed since she thinks Lee needed to have a lighter skinned black person to play Malcolm X, but I can't see anyone giving a better performance than Denzell.   <br />People say Lee spent too much times on the pre-Islam \\"husting\\" days, but I found it to be extrememly enjoyable, and essential.  As Lee said, you needed a long movie to tell the story adequately. <br /> <br />Look for Albert Hall's performance as Baines, which no one really talks about.  After Denzell, I think he gave the most impressive performance.   <br /> <br />ONly negative I can think of is the ending with the classroom.  The Ossie Davis eulogy was moving, and brought tears to me even though I'm not black.  However; having the kids shouting \\"I am Malcolm X\\" was a bit weak after that.  Should've just ended with eulogy.  But all in all a spectacular film.
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM's selftitled debut settled the landmarks for some new evolution in metal. Is not that they combined metal with rap...Anthrax and others did that before. Is not that they combined metal with funk...same story. The thing with RATM was that they showed some incredible right-in-your face lyrics, confrontational and most of the time, very self explanatory with no lines to read nor incomplete ideas. Other bands, such as Metallica and whole bunch of others included anti-system or some anger about the system on their lyrics, however, very few (if any) reached the sharpness and clearness of RATM's denouncing lyrics. Musically speaking, RATM drops some funk-rap-metal combination. A major role is played by the bass, coupling perfectly with minimalist yet effective drumming in the creation of strong, furious passages.  <br /> <br />Guitar has to be mentioned apart. On RATM's debut (as well as on the following albums) Tom Morello introduced several jaw-dropping effect combinations and innovative techniques. Amazing, truly amazing. Please listen carefully to solos.  <br /> <br />Five stars. <br /> <br />
B00008IHN1|4.0|Normally I would not be inclined to enjoy this sort of movie.<br /><br />But I found some of the themes and characters in this one to be quite interesting. I also found that the movie communicated a generally positive message. There were a few things that annoyed me, but overall I got a good impression.<br /><br />This is much better than most of what has been released after 2002.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|It's eric going back to the roots, and getting away from the commercialism that he's trapped himself in for so many years. It's pleasing that he departed from albums like Reptile, which was very commerical. It's true, Clapton did sellout, but unlike groups like Metallica, Clapton is now getting it right, and returning to the days where he took risks and did his own thing. True, its a covers album, but I hope that this album will tkae him in a new direction. <br />    The album is good, recording quality is much more impressive than johnson's. However, Johnson sounds liek johnson and Clapton sounds like clapton. This is not Clapton doing John'sons songs liek johnson did them. its clapton doing johnsons's songs in his style. <br />   If you wanted to get back in the roots of old blues, this is a good place to start.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I am a number one fan of the Foo Fighters. I have been following them since the very beginning, I have all their records and stuff, and I have been eagerly waiting for the release of this album. And what can I say? This double CD is truly the best ever Foo Fighters album! This band never fails to amaze me and the more time passes, the more they get mature in their productions. The first CD has the classical Foo Fighters rock formula and every single song on this CD stands out. Guitars with rhythm, angry voice and exceptional drum beats. The second CD is mellow and has the typical drive-along music, which you can enjoy while driving your car or during a relaxinng afternoon. I shall say nomore about this truly outstanding album. I am sure that all the Foo Fighters fans out there have already got hold of this jewel. Those of you who are not acquainted with this amazing band, go out there and buy this album, and I am sure that you will end up buying all the previous Foo Fighters albums. Long live Foo Fighters!!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Many people like to call Coldplay the next U2.  Here is the difference between the two.  U2 writes songs that everyone loves because it feels like they have always existed-or more appropriately should have already existed.  The beauty behind U2's songs is that they fill a void.  U2 writes songs that are exactly the song you wish existed, which makes hearing one of their albums for the first time just as easy as catching up with an old friend.  Coldplay is not this lucky.  Coldplay's music is less intrinsically familiar.  Their success relies on employing either an astute manipulation of simplicity (the dirge-like precession of the adulterated F chord in The Scientist, the ethereal elegance of the piano riff in Trouble, or the torpid baseline in Sparks), an overwhelming symphonic amalgamation of sound (the pounding intro that Politik is, the audacity of Yellow), or a blend of the two (Clocks).   Coldplay has always seemed to find that balance between the power to articulate with simplicity and emphasize with an inundation of sound.  Sadly though, they seem to have strayed from that formula with their latest endeavor.  They've managed to let their noise sound noisy and the simplicity become redundant.  They're no longer songs that force you to like them after the first listen, but require you to sit and search for elements that you admire, even after a few listens.  Though being multifaceted has its artistic merit, Coldplay didn't traipse that line delicately enough.  Many of the songs have a feeling of being too layered or overproduced, while others seem lacking and incomplete.  \\"We pushed ourselves as hard as we could go,\\" said Coldplay Guitarist Jonny Buckland about X&Y, however some songs seem not pushed enough and rushed (even after a 3 year hiatus).  The entire album leaves the listener with the question: \\"Did Coldplay advance as a band, or digress?\\"  While it feels like the music on X&Y is either too much or not enough, a notable plus is that Chris Martin seemsto have learned how to employ his voice to its full extent (which he was never really bad at to being with).  All in all the X&Y is not a bad album, but is by no means A Rush of Blood to the Head or Parachutes. <br /> <br />Joel B
B0007P3582|1.0|This is a sad excuse for a rap album. Hell, this is not even rap. This CD is tight beats with some idiot TRYING to rap. 50 has no lyrical talent. He may be good for a hook here and there but let's face it, he can't rap. Mainstream rap today has destroyed what true rap is. This has to be one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. If it weren't for the beats, this would get a big fat zero. I guess it isn't hard to sell records when you have producers like Scott Storch, Hi-Tek, Em and Dre despite how talentless you are. I would stongly urge whoever reads this not not waste your money on this album but rather on a Big Pun, Tech N9ne, Brotha Lynch, Chino Xl, or a Big L CD.
B00000490M|5.0|This is one of the few martial arts movies where you can say it has become a cultural classic.<br /><br />The story is compelling, it contains a strong plot, and also has somewhat of a moral to the story. It is generally realistic and the actors seem comfortable in their roles. It generally seems very genuine, except for the part when Miagi jumps the boys who are beating up on Daniel--that part feels a bit artificial.<br /><br />The actor playing Miagi does an EXCELLENT job. He is definately the crown gem of this film and without him it would not be what it is.<br /><br />This film has inspired and given hope to many a young wimp.
B0007P3582|2.0|the singles on this track are hot. i give him that. that was 1 star. the rest is garbage. took away 3 stars. now the only good things on this album are the beats by all the hot producers. tahts 1 star. <br /> <br />the only good verse 50 cent ever made was victory 2004 because it wasnt his own style.   <br /> <br />i was anxious of buying this album.  after the hour listening. shoot i listened to 5 minutes and turned it off.  gwen stefani's hollah back girl is better than this.

B0006L16N8|5.0|On the new CD, Coldplay gives us something old and new. They've borrowed a little from their first 2, but included something different also. You get the best of both worlds.

B0009NSE1K|5.0|Great Album. Glad to see CLUTCH makes different records. I think you have to be a little more intelligent to enjoy this record. <br />Enjoy. Better than TSL and PRF.
B00007FCTH|5.0|What can one add to what's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time? \\"Citizen Kane\\" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as \\"Kane\\" itself. It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane\\" and the HBO film \\"RKO 281.\\" <br /> <br />I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched \\"Citizen Kane\\" once and thought it was just OK.  But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for \\"Kane,\\" a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, \\"Kane\\" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it. <br /> <br />Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast. <br /> <br />The expertly produced documentary, \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane,\\" recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles' film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles' career tanked after \\"Kane,\\" the documentary glosses over Welles' achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which (\\"Touch of Evil\\" and \\"Chimes at Midnight\\") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to \\"Kane.\\" <br /> <br />While the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, \\"RKO 281\\" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and \\"Kane\\" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles' Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles' confidant throughout the \\"Kane\\" controversy, not Mankiewicz.  If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies. <br /> <br />Back to the inevitable question: is \\"Citizen Kane\\" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though \\"Touch of Evil\\" might be even better among Welles' own films. But \\"Kane\\" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. \\"Citizen Kane\\" has topped the highly regarded \\"Sight and Sound\\" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced \\"Kane's\\" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch \\"Citizen Kane\\" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself.
B000055ZDT|5.0|Earth-shattering amps are the weapon of Electric Wizard in the classic DOPETHRONE. Each track is an awesome ride in riffdom, soul-crushing in its doped-out intensity. Stand-out tracks include \\"I, the Witchfinder,\\" \\"Funeralopolis,\\" and, of course, \\"Dopethrone.\\" DOPETHRONE as an album displays such a mastery of the art that is the heavy doom/stoner riff that it may well be copied in the genre for years to come. There are others who have mastered the art, but DOPETHRONE will always be remembered as a classic because of it. <br /> <br />If you are watching MTV instead of listening to DOPETHRONE, you should probably be hung. Well, actually, I recommend the brazen bull.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|This is not \\"Hoosiers.\\" Coach Carter's team has its battles as it approaches the state championship. For example, the team flounders academically for which Coach Carter locks the team out of the gym. One should get a clue when Carter's team gets invited to the state championship and must play the top-ranked<br /><br />team in the state. An oncourt victory would make the rest of the<br /><br />season lose its meaning.<br /><br />However that is the message of this film. Enduring spirits are not all Hoosiers. Winning isn't everything. Winning isn't the only thing. Spirit means giving one's best... and perhaps losing... and willing to give it your all anyway.
630542845X|1.0|I use to like powder when i was younger but i did have alot of problems with the stupid things that happened in the movie. There were some moving scenes, but i did not like it when everyone used powder and stabbed him in the back after they got what they wanted. I remember my mom saying \\"were they his friend or what towards the end they all practicaly turned on him\\" I agreed. And the ignorant prejudice against powder for being an albino was exaggerated. I remember saying HE'S JUST REALLY WHITE, so what, but from the very beginning, even before they knew of his powers, they said WHAT THE F*CK WAS THAT? As if he was some sort of inanimate object. It's weird. jUST Stupid demented ideas throughout the story. For instance the spoon scene. The purpose of that failed to be obvious. What is suppose to be cool? Did he do it to show off his abilities but if he was smart and knew people were already very discriminating against him, why let the whole school know that he had powers? WEIRD movie. Nothing made sense. The only scene that did make sense was the deer scene. I'm against sport hunting and i liked it when he put the deers pain and suffering death into the shooter so he could feel what the deer was feeling. That was the one message i had no problem with. THAT and the \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" but that message fails miserably because no one seems to learn that message. The characters keep getting stupider and stupider. And the terminally ill scene was also moving, but like i said they used him, and then turned on him. I havent seen this movie in years but i remember it quite well. It's full of flaws and weird scenes, and comes off as being cheesy at times, and it gets you mad at times TOO. I understand what they were trying to imply when writing this story, but they failed when they wrote all the weird scenes in. Alot of the garbage in powder defeated the whole purpose of the message.
B00006AFUR|1.0|Whatever this is supposed to be it sounds like a total TOOL rip, with a little extra spaciness via cheap effects and superbly weak lyrics.  Not horrible, but by no means is there any ingenuity here.  This is defineately not prog, and those comparing to Pink Floyd are seriously off point (just because they reference the moon does not make it Floydian).
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I remember after the release of There's Nothing Left To Lose, good ol' David Grohl was griping how he thought the album was way too polished. He said that the next record would be hard rocking again. After all, we all know he's a dieheard metal fan(Probot). But thats not to say that Foo Fighters were that hard to begin with but they had a guitar driven hard rock sound that was so much cooler than Nirvana. The promised true to form Foo Fighters album turned out to be the radio friendly ga ga filler flunkie(One By One).In Your Honor is more of the same. Too much more. The first disc has the only too few good songs. But even they are lackluster. This *copy protective* business is pretty selfish if you ask me, and even if it was good I couldnt play it in my Mp3 player! The self-titled album and The Colour and the Shape are the ones to get.  Foo Fighters nowadays is synonymous with other fluffy, manufactured radio bands. Of course this is all one person's opinion, but I recommend for pure musical enjoyment listen to whats playing in the underground scene. Educate thyself!
B000000OQF|5.0|For as far back as I can remember, I can recall myself as a little boy sitting in the car while my mom played songs such as \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", and \\"Paradise City\\". That was when I was a little boy. I never really thought about considering Guns n' Roses as my favorite band of all time until now. <br /> <br />So I grew up listening to them, but not only them. It was around a time where there were lots of other things I enjoyed listening to more, such as some pop music stuff that I look back on and think \\"How could I have liked that?\\" <br /> <br />Last summer I started listening to Adema, and they were pretty good until the lead singer and guitarist left. I was digging through our CD collection. There was a cool looking CD called \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" I stuck it in the CD Player. That was when the childhood memories rushed back, and I enjoyed listening to Guns n' Roses even more than as a child. And you know what? If you apreciate good solid rock, you'll love these guys. I highly reccomend them. <br /> <br />
B000002JSN|3.0|The commencement of the downfall.  The first 5 zep albums were perfect, but this over-ambitious double lp marked the first time that the great zep employed that evil force of musical decadence we know as filler.  The first 5 zep albums were all perfect, and not one song from any of them were bad.  Physical Graffiti, on the other hand, included at least 2 songs (Houses of the Holy and Sick Again, the worst zeppelin song ever, yes even worse than carouselambra) that were just plain bad.  FILLER!  Both of these songs, and maybe a few others off of the album, are just unnecessary and uninspired.  After IV, zeppelin ceased to be a blues band, but at least Houses was still amazing without any blues jams.  Physical Graffiti does not amaze me like the earlier albums, and serves as an omen of the succeeding zep albums, which were even worse.  Why couldn't you just stay on bass Jonesey?
B000957O82|4.0|i LOVE martin lawrence in this movie. hes so original and unique with great comdeic timing. although most of the best jokes were shown in commercials, it held other suprises. the only problem i had was that the music was very predictable.
B00004Z459|1.0|It makes me sick to know that a group as untalented and worthless as Linkin Park has made it so big in the music world today.  Their horrific use of repeating chords and lyrics and their obsessive use of the same drum beats is an ugly sign of the downfall of mainstream music (not that it wasn't going down anyways but this just solidifies that ideal) .  Linkin Park in no way is musically talented.  The annoying \\"scratching\\" done in the background by whoever (note I don't know the man's name nor do I care to because it would be worthless for me to know considering they suck so bad) is used way way way too much.  The only good thing I see about LP is the fact that all of their songs are really short, meaning that as soon as the train wreck begins it's just as quickly over.  This album along with their second, consist of immature guitar playing, immature drum playing, and blood boiling screaming that is in now way useful for the so called \\"music\\" they are trying to make.  LP is a mainstream band with no musical talent whatsoever, and that's sad.  So many more talented people are out there not getting recognized yet here is a band with lyrics aimed directly at the \\"wannabe losers\\" of high school age.  From the very get go Linkin Park was a high school band, nothing more and EVERYTHING less.  They do not deserve anything that they've received nor do they deserve to come out with a new album.  The fact that they have such horrible time making up new \\"music\\" is evident when they release a different mix cd of their previous released every couple of months.  And on a further note... who the hell thought of bringing Jay-Z and LP together?  A talentless rapper and a talentless band = a talentless load of crap.  And who the hell gets off giving LP the credit of creating the rock-rap genre thing anyways?  From what I understand there were a couple of bands before pulling off this kind of stuff and do they receive the credit?  No.  The only reason LP gets the credit is because whoever writes their lyrics writes them so they can sell their music.  It wouldn't surprise me if these guys just kept writing stuff that they know will sell to the idiots in the high school age group that will buy this stuff, because all their lyrics really are is just a bunch of drama.  They try to think they're big and bad, but they are bad.... real bad.  I will never in my life, and I solemnly swear upon this, listen to another Linkin Park song as long as I live and anybody that does, well, those words I really can't say on here.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|In Love, Actually, a plethora of different story lines explore different types of love: that first crush, unrequited love, love denied, extramarital love (and what it does to a marriage), the obligations of familial love, etc. The movie does this via a host of characters played by some of the most recognizable names in the romantic comedy genre: Hugh Grant, Collin Firth, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, even Claudia Schiffer, for goodness sakes!<br /><br />The movie is very sweet (be forewarned), but it's also very well done. The performances are wonderful (especially Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson), and the stories of all of the different characters weave pleasingly together at the end, with most story lines reaching some sort of resolution.<br /><br />Note: I would NOT classify this as a family movie. Both nudity and language are evident. However, for adults looking for a sweet, feel-good movie about one of the most basic human emotions (final scenes depicting a young boy racing through an aiport to bid goodbye to the unknowing object of his affection did get me a little misty), this fits the bill nicely.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This new DVD is actually a two-DVD set that is more like watching the recent concert tour.  Hell Freezes Over is the classic \\"unplugged\\" Eagles sound, and I believe, the sound is cleaner on the Hell Freezes Over DVD.  Having said that, this DVD is also a \\"must have\\" for Eagles fans ... and it won't disappoint you.  The Mighty Horns (the Eagles horn section) is awesome, and all of the Eagles get featured on the songs they do when you see them live and in person.  If you like the Eagles, buy both DVDs and then, sit back and let the Eagles take you to the limit.  Excellent!!!
0553213105|5.0|I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen. It's also one of the most moving. The basic plot of the movie is this: A shy Joel (Carrey) meets the outgoing Clementine (Winslet), and the two fall in love. After a horrible fight/break up, Clementine undergoes a procedure that erases Joel from her memory. In the heat of anger, Joel himself signs up for a similar procedure. However, mid-way through the erasure, he changes his mind. The viewer is granted an opportunity to inhabit Joel's mind as he tries to hold on to the final shreds of his love with Clementine.<br /><br />The movie interestingly explores themes relating to love. When you really love someone, and the realtionship ends badly, you ARE tempted to wish the whole mess had never happened. This movie shows us what a tragedy it would be if our wishes were granted.<br /><br />I thought Jim Carrey did a fabulous job in this film; I don't think I've seen him turn in such a layered performance in anything else he's ever done. It's just such an original concept - the thought that you could erase people, places, things, from your memory. But if you erase things that bring you pain, you also erase some of the joy out of your life. And you erase part of who you are. If you erase your mistakes, you don't learn from them. And you don't grow stronger because of them.
B00000K19E|5.0|I don't need to talk about the plot, as everyone knows what it's about. The Matrix is a classic though because it's the first movie that really has the bullet time shooting/dodging effect and has some absolutley brilliant martial art fighting scenes. The first time you see the slo mo stuff, you'll know that this is some cool stuff. It blends sci-fi and martial arts and ends up making a classic movie that is the first of a a kind. This one isn't boring and weird like a lot of parts in the sequels and instead has a compelling story, a unique plot and some absolutely wicked cool fighting. Watch this one, if you haven't already, because it's a one of a kind movie.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The O.C. is cleverly written & has been perfectly acted out. The cast has been handpicked to supply a never-ending torrent of melodrama & pleasantry that can't be found elsewhere - for the moment at least.<br /><br />While obvious comparisons to Beverly Hills 90210 are present, the show manages to hold its own. If you liked Beverley Hills 90210 & Melrose Place you'll love the OC. At first I thought I was better than this but after watching a couple of episodes I realized how good it was, not only that; it had this feeling of warmth that made you watch it & root for the underdog (Ryan). It felt a lot like 90210 but with a modern twist & also a bit more liberal.<br /><br />Season II is great, I can't quite choose between seasons I & II because they both were different in their own special way. In season I we were introduced to the many wonderful characters of The OC like Seth & Sandy Cohen who provide the comic relief that all productions need, & they do it very well - not your usual slapstick-ish type of comedy but a darker more cynical type of sarcasm that sort of gets under your skin. The serious side of the show is nearly always provided by Ryan & Marissa. The couple seems to get in a fight every episode due to lack of communication but always finds a way to make up. As for season II, it dwells deeper into the casts emotions, triumphs & tragedy. I say tragedy for a reason; see it to know. I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />A lot of the fans of the OC regard the last episode of Season II as the best ever; however I don't feel it to be right to single out one episode when the entire season has been terrific.<br /><br />If you haven't seen season I, then I'd advise you to get that first. Jumping straight into season II would be a tad confusing even for the most passionate soap fan.<br /><br />The OC is TV history in the making. It's just a matter of time before we see the True Hollywood Story (THS) of the OC on E!
B0000640SA|5.0|If you're in a hurry, and have to decide whether or not you'll like tihs film, well, if you want to watch a movie where you don't have to think a lot, this isn't for you. This movie is very deep and you'll need to think a lot to understand it. I actually plan on rewatching it as I only saw it once and I was confused at certain points. This movie might make you feel like tearing your hair out if you don't pay attention to something. Now, for the plot. The movie centers around Leonard, a man that has no short term memory. After he was hit in the head while trying to save his wife who got raped and murdered, he lost his ability to retain new memories. While he can remember everything up to the incident, everything since after around 15 minutes is impossible for him to remember. Leonard thus thinks that everyone is a stranger to him. He takes polaroid pictures of everyone that he has met and writes their name and information that he should retain about them from a past encounter. (if they're a liar, etc..) He also must take pictures of his car, and Inn where he stays. Lenny's goal is to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man. He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend. But, he doesn't know who he can trust and life gets very hectic for him. The movie is told in reverse chronological order, going from the end until the start. Not until the very end (start...) of the movie will you understand everything. And then, you probably won't understand everything and will need to rewatch it. This movie is a masterpiece and it's one that I will definitely add to my collection. The ending is very unpredictable and excellent. The movie is a masterpiece as I have said because it's so original. The acting is great notably by Joe Pantoliano. After watching this one, believe me, you'll want to rewatch it over and over to be able to understand everything.
B0006L16N8|1.0|The pathetic lead singer of this group causes me to give this horrid review. He is nothing but a pale imitator of the pop style of Bono from U2 and the vocal technique of Thom Yorke from Radiohead. People compare his vocals of to the stratospheric Jeff Buckley but he is merely a sissy Thom Yorke impostor. The first album at least had credible power guitar hooks on tracks like \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver\\" that at least gave  these commercial mass market music perveyors masquerading as artists the facade of being a rock band. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is simply a reworked version of their previous single \\"Clocks\\". The only bearable song of this guy is \\"In my Place\\" but Thom Yorke has more intensity in one of the flaxen hairs of his scrotum than this flaccid banal pop star has in his whole body.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix started off a trilogy that could have and should have been awesome. The original was a classic and shall always be remembered. It's a one of a kind movie. On the other hand, the sequel lost me at certain plot points and had some unnecessary and boring parts but the compelling and absolutely awesome fighting scenes and \\"the chase\\" make it a very solid and good movie. And then, we go to the Matrix Revolutions. I was really excited to see the last installment of this trilogy but I was very dissapointed at the end.  <br />First off, I don't understand why certain characters are introduced and then that's it. They just dissapear. The frenchman reappeared in this one, but nothing really happened with him. The trainmaster was introduced and fought Neo and then he just dissapeared. The movie does have one awesome scene where the sentinels fight humans and giant robots that they pilot with big guns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. But, this scene did seem to last forever, a little too long than it should have. But, it still was very neat and awesome. And then, there's the ending which was a letdown to me. I won't go into details but this movie was even more of a letdown because the awesome precedessors were ended by a strange, and dissapointed conclusion. If you're a big fan, or just want to watch the REALLY LONG BATTLE SCENE, it's worth a buy, or else, buy the original which is a good movie while the sequels only have really cool and neat moments but are boring and confusing. The Matrix Reloaded is better than this one though because it has way more cool and awesome scenes. Well, there it is, my views on the final installment of a trilogy.
B00006M183|1.0|its pretty amazing how one of the worst musical failures in modern times gets a better review rating then much much better albums.Guess Pearl Jam fans are very easy to please.A musical yawn,cy and belch and 5 stars!    I remember that this album had like an 80 percent dip in sales in its second week.It was from people like me warning our friends (and enemies) not to get this album.    there are so many things wrong with this album that its hard to know where to begin.Vedder sounds like Elvis in his fat period The band sounds like the Elvis band during the fat period.Playing thous instruments half asleep dreaming of  vacations.    the beats are as boring as the band's new haircuts.And what happened to simple choruses?You know \\"Im Still Alive\\" and \\"Jeremy spoke in class today\\".    the only songs I remember from this album are \\"I am Mine\\" and \\"Loveboat Captain\\".One of which actually quotes the Beatles.Yeah,\\"All you need is love\\" is deep,dudes.    the others in need of lyrical rewrites,a much tighter band sound,and atleast some memorable hooks.    after Riot Act ,the band was all out of even lame ideas.Releasing various compilations to little interest.    now the biggest band of 1992 is signed to an indie label and still working on a new album.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is an asolute masterpiece. Mel Gibson has trully made an amazing film on the crucifixion of Christ along with his temptations and more. How you rate this movie in my opinion depends on whether or not you are Christian or whether or not you believe in God and Christ's crucifixion. Varg Vikernes needs not to write: \\"this weak ass guy carries a cross after hes been tortured.\\" This man obviously has no faith and for him to diss this movie as well as the bible is unnecessary. Here's a recommendation buddy, if you don't believe in Christ or aern't a Christian, what's the point of watching this movie? And then what's the point of posting a review saying that it's a piece of crap and typical holywood? If you don't have faith, why are you watching this??????? That review really frustrated me. Of course, many of you say that this movie was just made to make money, but I dissagree. I respect the fact that I believe that Gibson made this movie to make a point. All that we see on the screen is exactly what's written in the bible, and for those of you that say that it's too bloody, what about Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan? This movie made me cry but reading this passage in the bible can do the same. The blood was there in the real crucifixion, so why should gibson remove it and make it PG-13 or PG. This is the truth. And the blood there can maybe wake us up and let us realize that Jesus/Christ went through all of thagt pain and suffering for us. For the world. So that we can go to heaven and live in eternal bliss forever. So, the blood level was high because that's what really happened. And if someone were to say that Gibson was trying to make us feel sick, I doubt that because a lot of blood would come out if you got whipped like He did or got nailed to a cross. This movie is a masterpiece and it depicts the truth.
0060005424|5.0|The way Barth Nix leads you into Lirael's story is priceless.  The sentences and paragraphs form a movie screen in your mind where, after you pass the first chapter, you no longer control the stop button.  I recomedn this book for all young adults for it opened my eyes into a whole world of fantasy and imagination.  Garth Nix is a Mage with words in this gem of a book.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is by far Weezer's best album! Every single song is awesome! If you like Weezer or just like rock, this one's a must have. You get all for your money because you'll want to listen to every song over and over again. There's really nothing else to say. These are my top 5 songs in order of the best down: <br />1. No One Else <br />2. Say it ain't so <br />3. My Name Is Jonas <br />4. Undone (the sweater song) <br />5. Buddy Holly <br />Trust me, this is one absolutely amazing CD and every song is good! Now, that's rare for a CD, and you get all for your money. <br />
0060528737|5.0|A non-stop thriller that will leave you hanging in space, Abhorsen is, and will remain for some time, one of my favorite books.  Garth Nix weaves a net of drama and action, holding you captive until the very last word.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Do you know what I don't understand? Why would Amazon say that it's better together to buy this movie with the incredibles? So that parents who might buy it for the great deal accidentally show their small children that loved the incredibles THIS... I mean why wouldn't Amazon offer to package this with stuff like South Park instead? <br />I had mixed feelings after watching this. For one, it wasn't very funny especially not the stupid song: \\"America F$#% Yeah!\\" which wasn't funny at all. Of course, it had some funny humor but if made me feel degraded that Americans need to make stuff like this. It criticizes everything in our nation and basically just wasn't very funny. The hot puppet sex scene was very pointless and stupid and not funny at all. I ended turning it off towards the end because of the amount of profanity used by these puppets. If you like South Park which I don't, I'm sure that you'll love this. But myself, being a huge fan of Family Guy, expected this to be funny, but it just wasn't to me. I found myself just staring at the screen while puppets would run around cussing and shooting terrorists. This trully felt like a wasted amount of time while watching this. But, hey, maybe latter on in life, when I'm older, I might appreciate the jokes better. I trully laughed very rarely and struggled a lot of them, but that's just me.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is the album that got me into Dream Theater in the first place. The things that I like about it is how much musical ground that they cover on this record. It goes back and forth from melodic to heaviness to prog, for the most part pulling it off very well.  <br /> <br />Here is my song by song breakdown: <br />The Glass Prison - DT shows off their prog chops here. It is a 3part song about alcoholism. If you look in the liner notes to this song, you will see a message at the bottom of the page that says \\"Dedicated to Bill W. and all his friends.\\" Bill W. is the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, and this Mike Portnoy penned song is about the 12 steps to recovery. This song is just about steps 1 thru 3. (This Dying Soul on ToT is about steps 4-5, The Root Of All Evil on Octavarium is about steps 6-8) <br /> <br />Blind Faith - Great sounding song, awesome lyrics that will make you think. Also some great guitar playing from John Petrucci.  <br /> <br />Misunderstood - I love the beginning to this song. It starts with a very beautiful acoustic guitar piece, and it builds up to a powerful chorus. More great lyrics here, they are about how vulnerable even the most apparently \\"Made of Steel\\" person can be.  <br /> <br />The Great Debate - This song deals with a controversial subject - stem cell research. It's not championing a certain point of view, however, the lyrics present the facts and let you decide for yourself. This song also shows that John Petrucci is not only a master of the guitar, but a master of the pen, too.  <br /> <br />Disappear - Quite possibly the most un-Dream Theater song the band has written, but it also doesn't surprise me that they would write something like this. It has a Radiohead-U2 vibe to it. This song sounds bery beautiful. If you are in the right mood, this song will bring a tear to your eyes, as it deals with suddenly losing someone very close to your heart.  <br /> <br />Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence - Obviously the centerpiece of this record. It is actually a 42 minute song, but it is broken down into 8 smaller segments. There are six main songs, all dealing with mental instability.  <br /> <br />About to Crash and the Reprise-Deception of Fame <br />War Inside My Head-Vengeance of War <br />The Test That Stumped Them All-Feeling The Walls Closing In <br />Goodnight Kiss-Lives Torn Apart <br />Solitary Shell-Losing Oneself <br />Losing Time-Spiraling Down <br /> <br />The one thing that keeps me coming back to this album, as with any great album, is that it will grow on you with each listen. You have to be in the right mindset to listen to something lke this, but, then again, that is true with anything that requires some degree of thought.  <br /> <br />If you have never heard anything like this before, you will definitely think differently after hearing this.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|This is one of those albums that for the most part you listen to front to back and get a feel good buzz about the whole thing.  I can't say that about many cd's I own.  The entire album is well written and performed.  Amazing talent for a first effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003NA3|5.0|I bought this several years ago and it has sat in my collection mostly unlistened to (picked it up after reading raves at the time). I had some spare time recently, put the headphones on and the experience amounts to having discovered buried treasure. While I am anything but well-versed in the Coltrane oeuvre, I know excellence when I hear it. I was completely mesmerized and immersed in the experience of these recordings. Totally amazed.
0131177052|5.0|I've never read a technical book quite like this one. The author has distilled several years worth of experience into one highly cohesive and detailed book. <br />If you think you don't need this book because you aren't working on legacy code, think again. I recently joined a project that had only been going for a few months, and this book has been very valuable to me. This book helps recognize that many projects start off on the right foot and soon the code base turns into a quagmire. The advice here will help you turn it around, but it will not be easy even with this book.<br />Not only does it give solid advice for dealing with specific situations, it is written in a lively style that contrasts with the sometimes depressing work associated with maintenance.<br />The book is organized in a FAQ style, with chapters titled as questions. This makes it very easy to pickup and narrow down what part is relevant to your current situation. The final part includes a list of dependency breaking techniques designed to help you get code under test.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Clutch is a band who has always had a good flow, great riffs, a great beat, and lyrics that no other band can think of.  This album has continued their tradition of ass kicking rock.  The keyboards used on this album give a thick classic sound.  If you are a clutch fan, or just someone who likes to rock out.  you will not be let down!!!
0321213351|5.0|This is probably the best technical book I read that was published in 2004. If you are struggling to see how you can apply patterns in your day-to-day work, this book will help. <br />Most development work is done with existing code bases. It is less likely that you will have a chance to design something from scratch using design patterns that you are aware of. So this book helps you move toward a code base that is better designed in refactorings that lead to common design patterns.<br />The author suggests that many systems are now &quot;over-engineered&quot; due to the popularity of design patterns. I have not had the opportunity to work on such a system, but the book was still very relevant.<br />The code examples are actually very realistic and detailed, which I appreciated. Some readers may find them too complex and distracting from the refactoring steps, but I thought they strengthened the book.<br />I read the book in the order suggested by the author to those who want to study the patterns. It worked very well and the code examples carried thoughtfully from one refactoring to the next.<br />Examples are in Java but if you are using any OO language you will likely be able to follow them. <br />Many technical books are filled with typos and grammatical errors. This book was obviously well edited and not rushed out the door to publish.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Surfing with the alien is the second CD I have ever bought (the first one I bought was Wipeout 2097 soundtrack, but SWTA is the better one). It was actually this year, I wanted to start a CD collection, so I thought: Why not start with SWTA, when I have heard so much about the album? So I bought it, and when i came to listen to it, I liked it. However, it was a little hard to like it in the beginning, but when the tones got stuck in my head , I couldn't stop the humming. I bought it January the third by the way, and I have loved the album ever since. The favourite is Always with me, Always with you, and after that Satch Boogie and after that Surfing with the Alien. Oh, right, don't forget to buy it!
0780020685|5.0|The Seven Samurai, Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, is by far one of the greatest films in existance. After I watched it a few days ago, I put down the remote and whispered \\"wow\\". For people who judge graphics and effects in movies, well, you don't even want to think about what you're missing! The graphics and effects have nothing to do with a great movie, it depends on the storyline and characters and much, much more. And the storyline in this movie is by far one of the greatest ever. Set in 16th Century Japan, it follows the plight of a defenseless farming village that lives in constant fear of marauding bandits. The farmers know that when their crops are harvested, the thugs will attack, so four men go to town in hopes of employing samurai to fight for them. I don't care what any of you say, that storyline is awesome. The characters in this movie are just as cool and funny as actors today, so I don't know what any of you guys are arguing about! Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a perfection in nearly every aspect, titling it as one of the greatest films ever created. <br /> <br />Ohh yea, and I read a lot of reviews here saying that this movie was a rip off of the western \\"Magnificent Seven.\\" I admit the Magnificent Seven was a great movie, but to let you know, the \\"Seven Samurai\\" was made way before the \\"Magnificent Seven\\", so for those that think the Seven Samurai is a copy of the Magnificent Seven, you need to get your facts straight... <br />
0671027387|5.0|I love all of Dan Brown's books but I was most thrilled by this one.  It's more of a page turner with less facts than the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  If you're looking for a well-written thriller, this is a great book.
0688170528|3.0|Maybe it's because I have read four of her books in less than four months...maybe it's because I am tired of her writing style (switching back and forth between past and present)... maybe it's because I am tired of her writing courtroom dramas, but I this is my last Picoult for a while.  My star rating keeps going down and for someone who can keep me so engaged and emotional while reading (I read this book in a day, crying several times), I think she deserves a break from me reading her, so I can get some distance and start liking her books again.  I think if you have never read one of her novels, this is an excellent book to start with.  It introduces McAfee (the lawyer) who is also seen in My Sister's Keeper.  I assume he is in one of the books in between The Pact and Keeper based on his personal life, but everyone knows what happens when one assumes :)  Anyway, if this had been my first Picoult novel, or if I had allowed myself more distance between her novels, I probably would have given it at least 4-5 stars.  Recommended if this is your first Picoult novel or have allowed a couple of months between books.
0385504209|5.0|There's been so much controversy over this book for the past several years.  People don't understand the difference between FICTION and NON-FICTION, I guess.  When you read the reviews of other fiction books, you don't usually get a lot of controversial statements about the content of the book.  However, this one is different.<br /><br />There are so many Catholics and Christians who are upset by this book (which is why I was interested in reading it).  I took it for what it was: FICTION!<br /><br />Yes, I'm impressed with his extensive research and how well he wrote the story.  Yes, it got me thinking.  No, I don't agree that Jesus Christ had a child.  No, I don't think that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene.  Yes, I think the original Bible was altered drastically by kings in order to control the masses of people.  No, I don't believe Jesus Christ is God.  Yes, I believe Jesus Christ is the SON of God, as we ALL are children of God.<br /><br />I didn't get upset with the book because I disagreed with some things.  It's just a BOOK!  Even if it was non-fiction, I still wouldn't be upset because EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion and their story.<br /><br />As far as the book itself, the first few chapters were slow but, once I got past a certain point (I believe it was Chapter 6 or so) I couldn't put it down.  This was the most well-researched fiction books I've ever read.<br /><br />Good job, Dan Brown!  Make your next book EVEN MORE CONTROVERSIAL!
B0006L16N8|4.0|X&Y, Coldplay's hugely anticipated third album, has finally arrived, and in doing so has sold over a million copies worldwide in its first few weeks. But the main question all of you are most likely to ask, is this album better than their previous effort, the brilliant A Rush of Blood to the Head? In a word, the answer is no, but X&Y is still a fine album in its own right, and is undoubtedly one of this year's best. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"Square One\\", is unfortunately; nowhere close to the simple beauty of \\"Don't Panic\\" or the magnificent rocker \\"Politik\\" of the previous two albums. This song highlights two of X&Y's biggest flaws, inconsistent lyric writing and also overproduction. Sometimes one feels Martin's voice has been drowned by the background music and is therefore nowhere near as emotional as some of Coldplay's previous songs. Whilst some of you might say it is unfair to judge X&Y against Coldplay's previous works, it is inevitable that X&Y's greatness amongst Coldplay's discography will be measured against their timeless classics in Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head. <br /> <br />Throughout the entire album, many of the songs are brilliant in parts but absolutely dreadful in others, and in a sense, it feels almost as though the album has been rushed (strange when you consider it's taken Coldplay three years to produce it). The one song which highlighted this for me was \\"Talk\\", one of the better songs on the album which had a brilliant but repetitive guitar riff that ruined the song for me.  <br /> <br />X&Y has in my opinion, many incomplete gems in \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"A Message\\", \\"Til Kingdom Come\\", \\"X&Y\\" and \\"Low\\" which if given more work could've easily all fitted into Coldplay's 10 best ever songs. \\"Twisted Logic\\" and \\"Hardest Part\\" meanwhile never got me interested despite twenty odd listens and really highlighted the album's weak second half. <br /> <br />By now you are probably wondering how on earth I could've giventhis album 4 stars, well quite simply, it has 4 of the best ever songs you'll hear from Coldplay, \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\" and the `anchor' of the album as said by Chris Martin himself, \\"Fix You\\". <br /> <br />\\"White Shadows\\" is a very catchy song and shows off one of the rare occasions on X&Y where the electric guitar works brilliantly with Martin's voice. Its lyrics are simple yet effective and the song just emanates so much energy that I have never experienced from a Coldplay song before (not even Clocks).  <br /> <br />\\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", how I loathed this song when I first heard it, but after twenty listens, it has easily become my favourite. The much debated and criticised lyrics are in fact quite cleverly written and in parts such as \\"O what good is it to live, with nothing left to give, forget but not forgive, not loving all you see\\", the song is extremely uplifting. <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\", the first single, has been widely criticised for being too similar to \\"Clocks\\", the mega hit of the previous album. When I first heard it, I must admit \\"Clocks\\" didn't come to my mind as it wasn't one of my favourites from the previous album. After further listens to \\"Speed of Sound\\", I can now see the similarities, but I can also see the differences, especially the fact that \\"Speed of Sound\\" is a superior version of \\"Clocks\\", except for the latter's band-defining piano beginning. The lyrics are much more mature, the chorus is solid and most importantly, the song doesn't run out of steam halfway through like \\"Clocks\\" did.  Overall, this was a good choice for first single, as it didn't alienate old fans and would interest possible new fans through its similarity to \\"Clocks\\". <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, \\"Fix You\\" is perhaps the greatest song Coldplay have ever recorded, it's the spiritual successor to \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Trouble\\" of previous albums, but quite simply, it blows away those two excellent songs. Martin's vocals andlyrics at the first half of the song really shows how he has matured as a singer whilst the second half demonstrates the band's musical and instrumental brilliance. In a decade's time, we, the general public, could very well look back on this track and say, this is the song that we will remember Coldplay by.  <br /> <br />Finally, X&Y is a solid album, but being the successor to epic A Rush of Blood to the Head, it was almost destined to fail. Coldplay have taken a step, albeit a small one, to a different direction from their previous works, and in some ways, it has succeeded in songs such as \\"White Shadows\\" but failed dismally in tracks such as \\"Hardest Part\\". Ultimately, X&Y might be the best album of the year, but the best album of Coldplay? That honour goes elsewhere.
0385335482|5.0|I just happen to stumble onto this book at a little beach bookstore and I fell inlove with it! Confessions of a Shopaholic is a cute, funny, even romantic, story about Rebecca Bloomwood who has a serious shopping problem and better yet is in debt up to her elbows! I couldn't put the book down and finished it that same day I bought it. I have already ordered Shopaholic takes Manhatten and Shopaholic Ties the Knot! You won't be disappointed! I'm just sorry that I didn't find this book sooner!!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Man most of these critics on the album on St. Anger and this movie. Do you all even have a life. The documentary is one of the best rock docs ever made. You have to be real bitter to not appreciate and understand the meaning behind this movie. This is a must see.
B00003CXPD|5.0|\\"Billy Elliot\\" is British theatrical director Stephen Daldry's film debut, and what a seamless crossover. Even more amazing is the acting debut of Jamie Bell in the title role. Rumor has it that some 2000 young boys were ruled out first, but it's a wonder anyone was found who met the criteria at all. Despite his youth, Bell gives a top-notch performance as both a dancer AND an actor.<br /><br />This is a story of a family in a mining town in north England during a strike in 1984. Billy's Dad and older brother are both miners, and his Mom is recently deceased. Billy has been enrolled in boxing lessons, but takes an interest in the ballet class across the gym, and the dance instructor quickly picks up on this. Inevitable conflicts ensue, etc. That's enough plot information; I'm just here to tell you that everyone involved in \\"Billy Elliot\\" contributed their best efforts to make it a fine film, and succeeded. In addition to the aforementioned Daldry and Bell, there is Jamie Draven as Billy's brother Tony, Gary Lewis as Billy's father, and Julie Walters as his dance teacher. The movie contains drama without sensationalism, much humor, and of course music and dance; something for everyone.<br /><br />There is some coarse language, but it's not gratuitous. And surprisingly, the T Rex-based soundtrack fits in perfectly. I'm  willing to go out on a limb here and suggest that not only will \\"Billy Elliot\\" hold up to repeated viewings, but actually improve  with them. A winner!
B00003W8NM|2.0|Above all things, it must be said that Fight Club is a very fun movie.  It will probably be noted as an important cult film in the future, although I have to disagree with anyone who is predicting \\"classic\\" status.  Director David Fincher has given us an effective thrill ride, to the point where approximately no one will care that the material could have risen to much greater heights.  He has sacrificed the potentially fascinating nature of this story to the gods of MTV-generation sex-crazed macho teenagers.  If VH1 had broadened their parameters for their Top 100 Music Videos feature only slightly, it could have been the most notable Top-10 list that this cult fad would ever see. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, as it stands, Fight Club is not a very good movie.  Viewers far too hormonal to be bothered with the paltry development of thematic elements and weakness of characterization were quick to jump on their handy buzzwords for movies that they like - \\"cinematography\\", \\"editing\\", or even \\"directing\\", all of which are very easy to confuse with a movie looking cool and moving quickly.  Nobody seemed to mind that all three of those artistic elements are tools of filmmaking which, by definition, cannot be successful on their own.  All of the exuberant camera work and tricky shots that Fincher pulled off, while entertaining, do not amount to good directing because they are essentially meant to hide the film's material, not strengthen it.  The film's cuts are moving so quickly and with such a breathless gusto that Tyler Durden's catchy quotes sound prophetic and brilliant, simply because our minds do not have the time to process them.  It takes multiple viewings to realize how clich and nave Durden's wisdom actually is.  Nuggets like \\"You're not your ****in' khakis\\" and \\"Our Great Depression is our lives\\" may be penciled across thousands of high school bathroom stalls, but the overbearing cynicism comes up empty when applied to real life. <br /> <br />The real problem with the film is that it blatantly supplements the fantasy of thousands of bored faux-Gen-X'ers; the fantasy that your life is a lot more empty and depressing than it is.  It delivers this message in the only language that these people understand: overwrought cinematography and sound bites.  Its proposed escape from this invented world of hollowness is (what else?) violence.  But the movie is not concerned with the psychology or the implications of violence nearly as much as it is with the visuals.  When the movie is over, those who were unfazed by the final act's messy attempt at mind-screwery are so amped up by grandiose visions of bloodied faces and swinging fists that they barely care to figure out the movie's convoluted philosophy.  Which is for the better, given that the concept isn't all that fundamentally interesting to begin with. <br /> <br />A masterpiece adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel would have been a simultaneous ironic endorsement and searing indictment of the characters' ideals - it could have been the most scathing commentary about our fictionally alienated generation yet put to film.  Instead, the film operates as a triumphant rallying cry to its own specific audience, without leaving much of interest for those who are either outside the age/gender range or never had enough unfocused angst to feel the way that these characters do.  The best way to treat this movie is to let the MTV-bred fanboys have their fun and just let it go - they may never realize it's a poor movie, but since life is apparently so much meaningless trash, who cares anyway? <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones paved the way for many artists with her debut album-COME AWAY WITH ME- The sheer scale of her success was phenomenal and caught the world by storm, 5 GRAMMY's later she releases this extraordinarily different album -FEELS LIKE HOME-. What makes this album so different is the immensly new country sound of her. She paved the way for Rachael Yamagata & Jaime Callum with her soulful jazz and now she enters thr realm of LeAnn Rimes & Shania Twain. On this she sounds more like th Dixie Chicks with a fresh blend of pure country melodies.<br /><br />-SUNRISE- Is exactly what I'm talking about, so pure and sensual it creates a beautiful, intimate country track. The vocals on this track are superb, no ordinary singer can use the sort of harmonies Norah does. Lee Alexander's bass is a great asset to the whole track.<br />-WHAT AM I TO YOU?- This track is an immediate track that becomes so great to listen to. This is the pure country where she uses her assets (voice) well.Very bluesy.<br />-THOSE SWEET WORDS- Just about everything on this track works, the beautiful balladry that is beyond control, the lyrics are so warming and pure. It's funny how many times I could use the word pure in a sentence to describe this song.<br />-CARNIVAL TOWN- Phwoar! Actually to get a song to sound like a real-life situation is hard. This sounds like an actual carousel. The guitarist on this track is phenomenal.<br />-IN THE MORNING- Upbeat and the lyrics are a masterpiece that have a strong structural base. This song is unexplainable.<br />-BE HERE TO LOVE ME- Lovely melodical glimpses in this track, the same energy is kept the whole way through. Jones is one of the only performers who never drops her pace or energy.<br />-CREEPIN' IN- To hear this song live redeemed me because I love this song so much that I had my doubts whether she would be able to pull it off.<br />-TOES-This song brings a tear to my eye because of the wholesome lust and energy in it.<br />-HUMBLE ME- Signature Norah Jones, pure, peacefula nd lush. Not musch of a soundscape however it has a lushness about it.<br />-ABOVE GROUND- Exactly like -TOES-, beautiful & serene. again the lyrics have this meaningfulness.<br />-THE LONG WAY HOME- A cool Tom Waits cover, well worth the listen and this album would be nothing without it.<br />-THE PRETTIEST THING- Very lovely and what more can I say, she is at the top of her game. This adds just that extra bit of, well I can't quite put my finger on it.Fantastic.<br />-DON'T MISS YOU AT ALL- Great end to a fantastic album, the only real remnant of her debut. This track is so wonderful and lovely, lush. Beautifully crafted.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Again Norah Jones has amassed enough courage to create good music.<br />Stunning sophomore set.musch of a soundscape however it has a lushness about it.  -ABOVE GROUND- Exactly like -TOES-, beautiful & serene. again the lyrics have this meaningfulness.  -THE LONG WAY HOME- A cool Tom Waits cover, well worth the listen and this album would be nothing without it.  -THE PRETTIEST THING- Very lovely and what more can I say, she is at the top of her game.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril has changed her image, and that's a good thing. She started with \\"Let Go\\" and tried too hard to look like a rebel, when she was really a close hybrid of Michelle Branch and Alanis Morissette. <br /> <br />She's finally broken loose, into her own style. She finally shows her true feelings, not having a team of people telling her what to write, or writing it for her. Even though the songs aren't as catchy, the quality is higher. It beats others in the genre any day.
0671775308|4.0|I think people are missing the point if they think that this book intends that you should have a  \\"miserable life and save and have no fun\\". I think the point is that our economy has conditioned a consumer hungry, non saving society and it is a lot a question of values and balance. If you are on either extreme of the scale, then you should rethink your ideas. You cant take it with you but you also should leave a little for rainy day and waste not-want not, lol.
0671027344|3.0|Maybe I am not the right person to review this book. I read it on a recommendation from my friend, who told me it was very good. From the first page forward, I found it extremely depressing. Maybe I was too harsh on Charley, the main character, but I thought he should suck it up and move on instead of crying and pouting about everything. <br /> <br />The bottom line: if you liked Catcher in the Rye, you'll like this book. Personally, I hate high school drama and overly depressed teenagers who have everything in life and still whine about it. Sorry, but this is how I view Charley. Others can decide for themselves.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is one of my faves...and whats interesting, like the movie...I can watch it over and over. <br />I am not a Bill Murray fan ie his dramatic roles but I like his style of comedy. His co-star is ideal for the role...and is easy on the eyes.
1400032717|5.0|This was a quick read, but Haddon didn't need to be lengthy to make his point. I am not autistic, and it was very interesting to understand how autistics think. I used to think autism was like mental retardation, but after reading this novel, I understand that autistics don't think slow (in fact, in most subjects, they think FASTER than average), are very intelligent, but just have a different way of perceiving and judging things than most people. I think if people learned to appreciate autistics more, they could (and, I'm sure, do) make many more major contributions to science and mathematics.  <br /> <br />The novel was easy to follow, entertaining at times, sad at others, and very perceptive. Way to go, Haddon!
B000063DI9|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is Maiden's best album. Every single track is a stroke of genius and are tied together almost perfectly. This is an album that have ZERO tracks that could be considered \\"so-so\\". There are no tracks that you would prefer to skip through to get to a better song.  <br /> <br />I can (and do everytime) sit and listen to the cd from beginning to end. And even today I still manage to find something new and awesome about each song.  <br /> <br />If you've heard Maiden a little bit and want to see just how great this band is. Get this album. You won't be disappointed!
B00005JNJT|4.0|For Father's Day, my son and I went to see the fifth <br />in a series of Batman movies...\\"Batman Begins\\".  A <br />true fan of this big screen sequence, I thought this <br />prequel was refreshing, exciting...and on a totally <br />different plain from the first four.  What I <br />discovered was that Batman has a heart...has a <br />history...has every reason on the planet to don wings, <br />ears and abilities above and beyond the call of <br />Dracula.   <br /> <br />While I was expecting the same action-packed thrills <br />from the \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", \\"Batman Forever\\", <br />and \\"Batman and Robin\\" full screen classics, this one <br />hit a completely different nerve.   <br /> <br />It is a two-hour and 20 minute drama...creating the <br />life of Bruce Wayne from childhood to the Joker.   <br /> <br />Starring Christian Bale as Bruce (Batman) Wayne, this <br />one was far from being the action thriller with <br />non-stop special effects, violence and thrills.  <br />Director Christopher Nolan took this opportunity to <br />give Batman a heart...a purpose...a reason for <br />being...and he does it masterfully.  To achieve this <br />goal, he had no choice but to submit a 140-minute <br />masterpiece that achieves everything it set out to do. <br /> Don't bring the little ones.  This intellectual <br />thriller is 20% action...80% intellectual.   <br /> <br />Granted, the action builds in the last 30 minutes and <br />there's an awesome Batmobile chase, but the true merit <br />of this film is the heart of Batman.  Bale turns in a <br />highly believable performance as the viewer discovers <br />why Bruce became the comic book hero of the 50's.   <br /> <br />The music and sound holds this flick together.  <br />Wayne's heart throb Rachel (Katie Holmes), turns in an <br />average performance, but this film would have bombed <br />without Bale.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the finest performance is turned in by cinema <br />legend Michael Caine as Batman's butler.  He hasn't <br />missed a beat.   <br /> <br />If this film had been released as the first in the <br />sequence of five films, I would have given it a 5.  <br />But because us viewers expected more action based on <br />its predecessors, I give it an 4...which isn't bad.  <br />Bale bails this one out.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|When I first heard of Gorillaz and that they were supposedly an animated hiphop band (I was going by what a friend told me) I thought they were going to suck. THEN, I heard &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot; on the radio and it got STUCK in my head!<br />Anyway I went out and bought it, and I like nearly all the songs, except for &quot;Intro&quot; (it's dumb in my opinion) and &quot;Oh Green World&quot; (I can't get past the introduction without getting annoyed). The characters in the band are all weird yet somehow lovable, from the hyper cute preteen Noodle (who is a girl... I thought she was a boy!) to the calm Russel who gets possessed by ghosts, the almost zombie-like 2D to Murdoc, the Satanic bassist who lives in his Winnebago and who probably hasn't taken a good long shower for six months (and somehow manages to get me incredibly amused.)<br />Want some unusual music that will root itself in your brain and make you want to constantly sing along? GET THIS ALBUM. NOW.
B00005JNJT|5.0|As a huge fan of the first \\"Batman\\" movie, I had some serious doubts when I continuously read reviews, stating that this was the \\"best 'Batman' movie yet\\".  I just didn't see how any actor could play Batman better than Michael Keaton or how any villian could possibly top the performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  Then, I went to see this movie last night.  WOW!!!!! <br /> <br />This movie is simply amazing!! <br />Christopher Nolan decided to take us deep into the mind, heart and soul of the 'Caped Crusader' and let the audience see what, how and why Batman is Batman.   <br />We get to see Bruce Wayne as a child and watch the horrific murdering of his parents(this scene was very similiar to the first \\"Batman\\", except in the first one, the Joker kills his parents.  That is not the case in this film).  The audience is also treated to more of Wayne's father.  Nolan did an excellent job of depicting the relationship between Bruce and his father.  Every exchange we see between the two, easily displays the un-dying love Bruce's father had for him and the extreme respect both Bruce and Gotham City had for his father.(I get chills thinking of his father telling Bruce's mother that they are leaving the Opera, because he needs fresh air, not because Bruce is afraid of bats.  Truly an emotional scene and one that \\"brings home\\" the love between father and son). <br /> <br />After his parents are murdered, Bruce goes traveling and lands himself in a jail(for stealing merchandise.  All of which was from Wayne Enterprises and was actually owned by him.)  In prison, Bruce has his chance to release his anger over his parents murder on all of the convicts.  He is very feared and is very capable of handling more than 1 man(more like 8 or 9).   <br /> <br />From prison Bruce is picked up by Ducard(Liam Neeson), whom works for a gang of vigilantes, headed by RA's Al Ghul(Ken Wantanabe).  Here, Bruce is taught to use his fear as a weapon.  He is taught to fight, be invisible, instill fear into his enemy and most importantly, harness his fear as his greatest weapon.  At the end of his training, Bruce is asked to inhale the fumes of a very rare flower(which will be used by our villians in a plot to ruin Gotham City forever).  As he does this, he begins to hallucinate and is told not to fear his greatest fear; bats.  As he stumbles for footing and repels the soldiers that are trying to sneak-attack him, a large horde of bats swarms over him(in his hallucination).  Bruce falls at first, just to get back up(Alfred teaches him this lesson) and finally overcome this dreaded fear.  This is where Bruce graudates from training and is asked to execute a criminal the vigilantes have caught.  Bruce claims he is not an executioner and in a great action scene; burns down the vigilante headquarters, kills all of the members in the explosion, saves Ducard and returns to Gotham City to fight crime and return the city to the grand vision his father had always seen it as.  Oh, and on the way, the man who killed his parents is paroled.  Bruce decides he is going to kill him, but is beaten to the punch by the Gotham's crimelord, who kills the murderer in the hopes of gaining Bruce's favor.  That doesn't work. <br /> <br />For the next hour or so, we are brought back to Gotham, introduced to Alfred(Michael Caine), Rachel Doss(Katie Holmes) and Mr. Fox(Morgan Freeman).  We are shown Wayne Enterprises.  We see Rachel Doss in the courtroom, trying, to no end, to convict criminals; only to have them set free and declared legally insane by Jonathan Crane A.K.A. \\"the Scarecrow\\"(Cillian Murphy), who is on the payroll of the crimelord and will do what is needed to keep his men out of prison(Or so it appears at the start of the film.  As we learn more we see that he has a plan for these men, once he gets them into his asylum.) <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil any f the film for those who have not seen, but I did want to set up the premise for the film.  There are many twists and turns that start at about the point I have stopped at, and again, I wouldn't want to ruin this film, due to how magnificent it is. <br /> <br />My favorite part of this film is probably Michael Caine as Alfred.  He is simply perfect for the role and this movie gives us the best depiction of Alfred.  In previous films, Alfred was basically a friendly servant, with dry humor.  In this film, we see that Alfred is almost a father-figure to Bruce and actually persuades Bruce into keeping the mansion, and upholding the Wayne family name.  Alfred and Bruce argue quite a bit throughout this film and the dialogue between the two is so intelligent and so well-worded that you almost forget you are watching a \\"Batman\\" movie.(Nothing beats the repeated \\"Bruce, why do we fall down?  So that we can learn to get back up.\\"  This line is repeated 3 times by Alfred during the movie and each time, becomes more powerful)  I love the dialogue, because it makes you realize that Wayne is an educated man, not simply a good-looking crime-fighter as depicted by the likes of Clooney, Keaton and Kilmer. <br /> <br />Morgan Freeman is also a joy as Mr. Fox, an applied scientist at Wayne Enterprises.  He is funny, smart, and a very large part of the plot, albeit the fact that his screen time is relatively short in this 2hr 20min masterpiece. <br /> <br />Cillian Murphy is very creepy as \\"scarecrow\\".    <br /> <br />KAtie Holmes gives an adequte performance as Rachel Doss.   She's pretty and has that quality of appearing as such a sweetheart that she makes the role very believable. <br /> <br />Christian Bale IS Batman.  He truly fits this role better than I had imagined and gives Batman a human quality that his predecessors could not pull off in previous films.  He keeps the calm, quiet mystique of Bruce Wayne, while delivering what seems like a total different performance when he dons the Batman costume. <br /> <br />The scene that made this movie for me, is when Batman reveals his identity to Rachel.  In a scene that will give ANYONE goosebumps, Batman is on a rooftop, just having saved Rachel and a little boy from certain death, when Rachel asks for his name.  Batman repeats a line Rachel had told Bruce earlier in the film, during an argument the two had; \\"It's not whats underneath, but your actions that determine who you are\\"----this is such an emotional and wonderful part of the movie, my words simply cannot describe.  It's this sort of dialogue/writing that make this movie oscar-worthy! <br /> <br />Another great part of the movie is that Gotham City is clearly modeled after my hometown, Chicago.  This is very clear on the skyline shots(I would know) and the 'EL', which Bruce's father built to help the \\"lesser-offs\\" comute cheaply.   <br /> <br />Folks, I cannot say enough about how fantastic this film is.  Kudos to Christopher Nolan for reviving the \\"Batman\\" series and ending it on the high note it deserves!  There is NO WAY any \\"Batman\\" fan can be disappointed by this film! <br /> <br />ENJOY!!! <br /> <br />P.S.  I watched this movie at a Drive-In and as my friends and are were staring, completely engrossed in what was going on; a bat swooped down and zipped right between us!!!  I swear it happened and freaked the hell out of all of us. <br />
1400032717|2.0|I myself grew up with autism which developed into Asperger's syndrome, and I am the author of two books on the autism subject. Overcoming Asperger's is a feat for anyone, which I thankfully overcame for the most part, and I did it On my own Terms! I must say that Mark Haddon's book about Christopher is impressive on one level, although there were some places where the author (not being autistic himself) missed the mark completely. For example, when the police officers came to the site of the dog killing, and Christopher hit the officer, who subsequently arrested him. In the truth, Christopher would have continued hitting the officer many times as they would have wrestled him into the patrol car, because of his sensory overload about not being touched. Wouldn't have mattered if it was a police officer. This unrealistic \\"special treatment\\" of only hitting the police officer once would have not existed. The officer would have had a full fledged fight on his hands! Don't kid yourself. <br />I would have liked the book a lot more, had Mark Haddon not printed the curse words! Yes, I realize that's what normal dialogue involves with some people, and he was trying to be accurate, but there are symbols which any author of courtesy would have used, such as #%@, and &*%#. Get the picture? That's how I display curse words in the books that I write, if I quote dialogue. Never do I spell them out. I have the general public to cater to and to Not offend. Mark Haddon needs to learn the same courtesy.
B00080ZG10|3.0|The customs were great in this picture.  The camera work was also well thought out.  The acting was also quite good.  However, the story and most of the dialogue was boring during the second half of the movie.  The first half of the movie was interesting and well-received.  I think with Dicaprio repeating the same words over and over again was quite irritating and made me start to repeat the words as in a making a joke.  I do think the movie is over-rated and needs a better story and dialogue.  However, the directing, acting was very good.

B00000099Y|5.0|First things first-- this is CD is not going to cure cancer... and Maynard is not some type of deity.  Sorry that I had to start off this review in such a blatant manner, but to me it seems that the other 5 star reviews were written by the type of fanboys who nod along to every word of maynard's.  Sure, this is a well written album, and don't get me wrong, well deserving  of 5 stars, but some people take this band too seriously.  That is the problem with Tool, it attracts fanatic fans that agree with every word maynard utters, which, unless i am mistaken, contradicts the band's whole 'think for yourself' message.  But then again, I'm 15, what the hell do I know.  One thing I do know though is that here, my friends, is an album worth the money.    -peace
0553573403|4.0|I got my copy of this book almost seven years ago. It got so worn and frayed from lending to friends that I had to buy a new copy. Anyways, I believe this book has raised the bar on how a good fantasy should be written. In earlier efforts, you had your heroes of cliched lore, the enchanting magic, the whimsical creatures, the megalomaniacal villain. You won't get much of that here because the author loves to play within the gray area of things. The heroes are complex and flawed, the villains empathic, you'll just love it to bits especially if you're the typically jaded fantasy reader. In addition, the storyline is complex with twists so delightfully devious and unexpected that you won't see a lot of them coming. A kind of sneak behind your back, stab you and twist the knife kind of devious. You will be surprised. A lot.<br /><br />I adore this series and am one of the quillions of fans who are eagerly anticipating the fourth book this november after such a long, blasted wait. Of course there are some things that kind of get to me with regards to this book and its subsequent follow ups. I've read the ASoIaF (Acronym for the books) about thrice now (I know, it's geeky) and have begun to notice a trend brewing in George RR's series. He has a penchant for the bittersweet and the just plain bitter. In a lot of instances, you will read about brutal killings, wars, rapes, betrayal and injustices without so much as a bit of compassion, redemption and dare I say retribution. It's tough because sometimes I wish the reality could be stretched a little bit to make things more bearable. Because you will feel for the characters, you will empathize. And a lot of times you will be left high and dry without something to hang onto until the next installment. And if there's anything that I can't stand, it's a lousy cliffhanger. And George just loves them cliffhangers. You WILL get a degree of closure after every installment, but they're so bare that you might be feel a little cheated out of things that should be written but are instead left unsaid. Definitely makes the story compelling though. How very devious. But, man, it also makes me groan a lot of times as I wait for the series to reach its conclusion, something that's already years in the making.<br /><br />But all in all, any fantasy reader should look into this one. Magic is barely mentioned here and the fantastical creatures are practically invisible but that's but a grain of salt compared to what the reader gets in return: a fantastic and wonderfully written story, very impressive character building and an awesome and lively world to name but a few. This is the best fantasy series in my opinion. The sh*t, the king of the mountain. But beware, because you will get hooked and it takes a day short of forever for the author to finish writing the series' next installment as fans already know.ed out of things that should be written but are instead left unsaid.

B0007DA6GI|5.0|Big Fish is often referred to as a \\"father and son\\" story, and the story is indeed based around two main characters who are father and son.  What I'd like to convey, however, is the idea that this story is applicable to almost any close relationship within a family.  This is especially true for anyone who sometimes wonders, \\"How did I come from this family?\\"   Or for anyone who's ever lost someone very dear to them, but was still left with a lingering feeling of never really knowing the person at all.      The film was made by Tim Burton after losing his own father.  And he combines personal life experience with his own visionary cinematography style to create an enchanting, unique, and moving film.  This film is a celebration of life, and those who truly live it.
B0009IW88A|4.0|The previous reviews cover the darkness of this score pretty thoroughly. But I'll add another observation. Read the title's first letters in sequence. VEC-BATMAN-MCI. Huh?
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Based on a Stephen King's shot novel, this ambitious film has several levels to analyze. But there is a Montesquieu ' s  clever statement that I would remind for you; \\"I `ve been noticed that if you want to triumph in this world you have to look like a fool , but without being it\\".<br /><br />Watching carefully this picture, we have to underline the remarkable and wise election of these two giant actors: Tim Robbins as Andy Defresne, a successful executive who lives in own flesh the shame of the adultery and besides has been sent to prison being innocent. Once he installs in prison he decides to bring hope airs to that hostile and inhuman environment. He will befriend with Morgan Freeman, and the time elapses from 1949 through 1966: three generations; three portrait Goddess: Rita Hayworth (Gilda), Marilyn Monroe (Seven Years itch) and Raquel Welch ( One million years before Christ) that will cover his passion for the beautiful women but also his dreams. His perseverance, patience and goodwill will transform the inhumanity and soon he will sculpt not only chess figures on rock, but the respect and tender of every man in the prison. Thanks to his experience in the Finances World, he will create a solid reputation and special status among the prison's highest authorities.<br /><br />And in that state of things, you will understand there are two suggested, deserved and  beautiful homage to Robert Bresson's A man escapes, and Alejandro Dumas? The Count of Monte Christ but complemented with a more terrene vision, even the circumstances not necessarily be the same.<br /><br />Stunning film and one of the most important American pictures in the nineties.
B000244FDW|5.0|I agree completely with A. Haight, who wrote a review of this BBC version and the A&E version.  Everything he/she said was what I have thought for many years now!
B0000C4GKN|5.0|Mr. Carter has gone straight to the point: the MOSAIC Grachan Moncur III box set, remastered by Ron McMaster sounds just like rubish. The two G.M.III albums originally issued by Blue Note are must haves - I take SOME OTHER STUFF to be not only G.M.III's masterpiece but one of the truly greatest albums of the entire B.N. history. Anyway, let's pray this is released in the U.S. under an affordable price.<br /><br />P.S. WE LOVE YOU Mr. MONCUR.<br /><br />P.S. II WE HATE YOU Mr. McMASTER.<br /><br />P.S. III WE LOVE YOU Mr. VAN GELDER.<br /><br />P.S. IV Listen to this one next to TONY WILLIAMS' B.N. debut, the wonderful LIFETIME (1964 also).
B00005JM02|3.0|again somebody tell me what kind of collector's edition is this?  really. there is widescreen version on disc 1 and fullscreen version on disc two plus some short documentaries and special features! a double box, 2 dvds, an insert, not notable special features and they call it collector's edition. buy the single disc edition, trust me, there is nothing more, worth to pay that extra price!  also see my review about \\"The Incredible Collector's Edition\\" for additional information about a decent Collector's Edition Item before rate my review as \\"UNUSEFUL!\\"
B00097A5I6|1.0|Oasis were on a winner with Heathen Chemistry, this is the biggest peice of crap, its unbeleivable. <br />To say that this is as the best since Definitley Maybe is joke! <br />For cyring out loud, The Spice Girls have better albums than this!! <br /> <br />Its ireedeemably bad and a joke and a half, how can people put down  \\"Standing on the shoulder of giants\\" and \\"Be here now\\" as dissapointments and failures!!! They're both great albums! <br /> <br />This does'nt even compare, its not even worthy of comparing, and Lyla is just disgusting. <br /> <br />Goodbye Oasis, you never lost your diginity untiul now.
B0007P3582|4.0|I have to admit that when i first listened to this album i was incredibly disappointed. However, it soon began to grow on me. I particularly liked \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\", \\"In My Hood\\" and \\"Just a Lil Bit\\". I believe that 50 put in much more effort into his album, and should relax when making his next one. He will sell at record levels no matter how good or bad it is. The beats are incredible, expecially in songs such as Candy Shop and Just a Lil Bit, where he combines old Arabic melodies and incoporates them into a fine rap album.  <br /> <br />Honestly, this album is great, and the reason why so many people are disappointed is because 50 Cent created so much hype before his release. They expected something along the lines of \\"masterpiece\\", such as 2Pac's All Eyez On Me. There is still a long way to go before they get something which reaches that level.
B00079018K|5.0|First off let me say that this band and album are excellent but the other glowing reviews should make that clear to you.  I want to take this opportunity to warn everybody about the grossly unfair restrictions that BMG has put on this CD.  I made the mistake of buying this CD and now I am screwed.  I can only play it on a CD player.  When I put this in my computer, it immediately crashed it so bad that it immediately rebooted and I'm running Windows XP.  I know it was the CDs fault because when Windows booted back up and I  ran the executable on the CD, it immediately crashed again.  But that isn't the worst of it... like millions of others, I have stopped listening to CDs and prefer using an iPod or my computer for listening to MP3s.  Well these ingrates have made the music on here completely incompatible with an iPod.  I can't rip the music and the enclosed format is only in WMA format which isn't compatible with an Apple product.  I am now refusing to ever buy another CD by BMG and will support it's artists by going to thier own websites and buying the digital version from them directly or find the music illegally on the internet and them tell all my friends about the band and then see them in concert, which will do them a lot more good than buying a CD that mainly serves to fatten the pockets of the record lable...<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />So if you wanna rip this CD you need to diable a driver that this CD will maliciously install on your computer without your consent.  The driver is called sbcpHid and you can find in in the Device Manager by turning on \\"show hidden devices\\" adn \\"device by connection\\" in the \\"View\\" menu.  Double click SbcpHid, click on the Driver tab, press the button labled \\"Stop\\" and click the drop down list and select \\"disabled\\".  Reboot and then you should be able to rip the cd with anything software you like (I highly recomend Exact Audio Copy).
B00005AQGH|3.0|I have to admit, that there are quite a number of songs on this album which did scare me to a small extent - i.e \\"Blasphemy\\". In spite of this, this album is quite good, yet can get on my nerves after a while. \\"Bomb First\\" is excellent, as is \\"Against All Odds\\".  <br />  <br />J - Vidi's Top Songs: <br />* Bomb First <br />* Against All Odds <br />* Hail Mary
0694013013|5.0|My 4 year old grandson and I watched Eric Carle on a Mister Rogers episode where Eric Carle read this book aloud and he and Mister Rogers acted out each movement.  Each page has an animal talking about moving a part of the body, for example turning their head, shrugging their shoulders, waving their arms etc and saying \\"I can do it, can you do it?\\" and the child responds, \\"I can do it!\\"  My grandson memorized this book in a few readings and proudly reads it to everyone he meets, demonstrating, \\"I can do it, can you to it?!!\\"  A couple of the movements my grandson found difficult to imitate, but that didn't slow him down, he merely substituted, \\"Can you do it??? I can't do it!\\"   Loads of fun for the young child who loves to demonstrate how he can memorize & read a book and for the child who loves to add motions/movement to songs or stories.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This is the Deftones most raw and unpolished CD they have released. Good transitions from screaming adrenaline driven songs to slow and laid back. This band is hip hop influenced which is good (calm down I'm not saying they're like Linkin Park or anything) but they certainly have that influence, which sets them apart from other metal bands since their songs all have a good melody. Chino's vocals and lyrics are amazing. Stands out from any singer in music today. The high pitched screaming is like a breath of fresh air, since most metal singers like to do the deep beastly screaming which is pretty cheesy in my opinion. Stef makes some of the greatest riffs I've ever heard, can tell them apart and you can hear them easily, aren't jumbled up like System of a Down or Slipknot for example (calm down I like those bands just fine, don't get all mad). Chi sets himself apart from any bassist because you can actually hear him playing, a lot of the time he doesn't do the same thing the guitarist is doing (like most bassists do) instead making a fantastic bass line that stands out but still flows with the song. Abe is a very underrated drummer, he plays a big part in their hip hop influence, doesn't do the melody killing and often annoying double bass drumming. Just cut out everything else and listen to this guys drumming and you'll hear how amazing he is. A very energetic drummer, you should see him live. My favorite songs on this CD would probably have to be 7 Words, amazing song writing singing and screaming, gut wrenching squealing guitar, slick and almost jazzy bass line, catchy drums. So if you want the most raw Deftones CD there is, this is it, but if you want to get into the Deftones don't expect all of their CD's to be like this one, no two Deftones CD sounds alike. PS, the Deftones aren't \\"nu-metal\\" or \\"emo-core\\" or \\"Korn\\", these are ridiculous labels for this band, the only label I'll give them is the Deftones. <br />
B0000A4GAK|1.0|This album is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. There are some songs on here that had real potential and Derek Trucks butchered them with his psychotic slide playing (e. g. \\"Afro Blue,\\" \\"Bock to Bock,\\" \\"Oriental Folk Song,\\" which are jazz standards now). He needs to learn how to play actual notes without the slide, because quite frankly I'll never buy anything by Derek Trucks again for the simple reason that his style isn't up to par with anyone that I like. Not to mention that he's not that mature of player anyway. He's a wild card. One minute he's playing something with substance, then he totally ruins it by playing slide.<br /><br />In my opinion, the slide is an effect. That's the only reason I would use one, but Derek really needs to learn how to restrain himself and he also needs to play with his fingers, because that's where the actual beauty will come in. I can't relate to a glass slide at all, but I can relate to fingers touching the strings and that's something he hardly even did on this pathetic excuse for an album!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0002X314C|4.0|Let's be real people.  The people dissing this album are probably hardcore Beyonce fans, with no concept of what real music and instrumentation sounds like.  This is a good, solid album.  No he doesn't have the greatest voice I've heard, but let's face it, neither does Alicia Keys (I'm a fan, but we're being real - her voice is trained, not good).  His voice is smooth, and full of emotion, and the lyrics throughout are strong.  He's a breath of fresh air considering the fact that we are just coming out of pop purgatory, with people like Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, and even Beyonce leading on the charts.  This is a talented singer/songwriter/musician, and I look forward to hearing his future efforts and seeing more of him live, which I have to say is far better than hearing him on CD.   <br /> <br />On my first listen I didn't like this album either, since many of the first songs focus on cheating or lying to his lady/her man, but even songs like \\"She Don't Have to Know\\" are undeniably strong and irresistible.   <br /> <br />Give this album a chance, try to hear him live, and I'm sure your opinion will change.
B00004Z400|5.0|<br />I won't waste my time with a long review.  Just buy this album -it's excellent.  <br /> <br />Stewart LaBar listens to crappy music.  take his comments with a grain of salt.    <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|When I first found out she was coming out with an album, I though,\\"Oh NO!! This one is going to suck!!\\" But I took the chance and bought it and I absolutely LOVE this album, from beginning to end. Her first song,\\"It's Like That\\" is simple and her voice fits her well, and I like \\"Say Somethin\\" w/Snoop Dogg--it's different and funky, and when I listened to \\"Circles\\", the girl made me cry!! It touched that part of me that I didn't want to come out--it will touch your soul. \\"If you only knew\\" made me cry too...very emotional song. but my favorite hands-down is \\"Joyride\\". That song is one of the most beautiful songs I heard thus far!!! Buy this one cuz she is DEFINETLY back!!!
B00005JMUL|5.0|A great movie. For those of us who are dead in the heart and mind, this movie comes as a refreshing break... While the kids would love the movie, WE should watch this so that we search ourselves to find something which we maybe have lost.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Visually, this is the most interesting thing to appear on the screens between \\"Attack of the Clones\\" and \\"Revenge of the Sith.\\"  Conran needs to get on with Lucasfilm, or Dreamworks SKG.  He has the same eye and more importantly, the same sense of artistry that Spielberg and Lucas have.  He understand that the camera is for framing, and not merely recording, and is almost virtual actor<br /><br />You really feel that you are in the retro-future of Art Deco, balancing Fritz Lang and Flash Gordon.<br /><br />There are only two weak points: the storyline and the casting (not the acting).<br /><br />On the DVD, you can see the 6-minute short that was used to pitch the film.  I think Conran spent so much time working on the visuals that he neglected to think out the whole story line.  That is why the first 10 minutes of the film seems luscious, and slowly gets thinner as the film progresses.<br /><br />Another problem was with the \\"McGuffins.\\"  The movie begins with the German scientist with the Adam and Eve test tubes and the plans to the Mechanical Monsters, but these are ignored as the movie progresses. This is disconcerting, since the expectation is that the whole plot of the movie will hinge on these two objects.  As the film runs past the two McGuffins, we move from McGuffin to McGuffin-the bubble-gummed map, the information that leads to Monster Island, and so forth.  We are given a thread, but it just snaps in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />Admittedly, this film is an homage to serials and the 1930's films, which are disconnected and fragmented, but having a smooth McGuffin would have made the film easier to watch.  Follow Spielberg's and Lucas's lead in Episode IV and Raiders by holding the story together with one McGuffin.<br /><br />Secondly, the casting is . . .I'm not sure different is the right word.  Jude Law would not be my first or even last pick of the Sky Captain.  He delivers the lines accurately, is believable, and took a professional risk doing a film like this.  But having an effete, British pretty-boy play the Air Cowboy almost works, but it is not what you would expect with such a unique film.<br /><br />Gwyneth was a good pick. She looks like could be from the 1930s, and has the hair to suit the role. However, mid way through the film she falls out of character and acts like a 1990s woman.<br /><br />I thought the banter dialogue was superb and makes the film relatable. However, the 1930's had a unique form of slang that, except for Jolie, no one picks up on.  The slang-which can be read in the Doc Savage and Lensman stories adds color to the ear, and is as important as chronologically-sound costuming and props.<br /><br />By the way, Jolie with an eye patch was an unusual move.  It hearkens back to Nick Fury, but looks rather weird on a British Dominatrix. Wasn't this first done in \\"Twin Peaks?\\"<br /><br />The last complaint has to do with the robots.  In order to have the technology, you need money, and remember there is a Depression going on. Also, the hovering hunchback robots were a bit too much.  It crossed the line of believability.  After all, if Totenkopf has the technology to have antigrav in robots, he could have put it on the rockets.al risk doing a film like this.

1400032717|4.0|I picked up this book based on the enthusiastic recommendation of Entertainment Weekly. They didn't steer me wrong. A first person narrative from an autistic British boy, the book explores the mysterious murder of a neighbor's dog in a style so unique and engaging that I literally did not want to put it down. I really came to care about the protagonist, and the ending of the novel moved me to tears. (And prompted me to go spend some quality time with my kid.) Given the overall impact the book had, I feel a little churlish tossing complaints at it, but in the interest of accuracy I have to say that I felt the plot was a bit lacking. Some reviewers have complained that the story is underdeveloped. I don't share that concern; since we're looking through Christopher's eyes, it makes sense to me that he would focus on some elements and not others. But the solution to the mystery seriously disturbed for me the picture of the universe Christopher had established--and not in a particularly plausible way. Still and all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the character and the presentation alone, so I'm willing to overlook it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|What can I say? This title SHINES. Josh Groban is one of the best vocalists of this generation-and his voice easily blows away many of his contemporaries. Despite the fact that my CD collection doesn't contain many CDs like this one, I still find myself popping it in my CD player more frequently than all the rest. It's a great easy listening CD, even if you can't necessarily understand all the lyrics in his foreign language songs. <br /> <br />I purchased this CD having already purchased his previous CD and LOVED it. This CD followed suit and didn't disappoint. Many of my favorites can be found in the middle of this CD including 'Per Te', 'Il Postino (Mi Mancherai)', 'Si Volvieras A Mi', and 'My Confession'. Those being my favorites, I still have a likeness for the rest of the songs. None of them are horrible-and despite average melodies on occasion, Josh's voice shines. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this CD is if you don't enjoy CDs that rely heavily on outstanding vocals, often in other languages. <br /> <br />To make a long story short, personally I don't have anything but compliments for this CD and the artist. I'd recommend both to anyone and 14 bucks is really a small price to pay for music of this quality. But my review wouldn't be complete without suggesting, as I do in all of my other reviews, to listen to amazon's samples because to purchase a CD based heavily on reviews by other INDIVIDUALS (and I stress individuals), is a fairly big gamble.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I hate to say anything bad about this great release (great sound, picture, performances, songs) but... <br /> <br />1) I don't think any Eagles album had horns on them.  They are absolutely not needed and clutter and drown the beautiful ringing guitars.   <br /> <br />2) No Don Felder!  He is sorely missed in terms of his playing (sweeter than the guy playing here) and on-stage presence and chemistry with the others (re-see the Hell DVD and take notice of this).  Both the 4 Eagles and the cameras try to ignore the substitute guy but this just accentuates Felder's absence.  In contrast to Hell, there are more non-Eagles on stage than Eagles, the balanced tipped by not having Felder.  Can we get him back?
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System has released yet another awesome album. When I first heard BYOB I was hooked. Their album blooms with originality and Serj's voice is stronger than ever. I found that a lot of their songs like \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\" somewhat humorous.  <br /> <br />I don't understand the people who review albums saying, \\"I've hated all other SOAD albums but I decided to give this one a try and it sucked.\\" Okay, not a good reviewer obviously. That's like me reviewing Polka's greatest hits and saying, \\"This is the worst Polka album ever but then again I hate polka music.\\" Don't pay any attention to ignorant reviews like such. Those people had nothing better to do.  <br /> <br />Go out and get this album. You won't regret it. It's sold so much and their concert sold out in 2 mins. (I can't wait to see them 8/4 in Long Beach!) Overall SOAD is an awesome band that sticks out from a lot of the other bands that are currently making music. They stand to be mainstream but not too mainstream. This album is a testament to their greatness. I didn't know how I would feel about this album after \\"Toxicity\\" and my favorite SOAD song \\"Spiders\\" but this quickly changed my mind. I can listen to the cd without skipping any songs. Thanks again System for yet another awesome mind-blowing album!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|I won't argue that this is a flawless work.  Ryan O'Neal is just adequate, holding up his end mostly with good looks (as usual).  Kubrick would have done better with an actor Irish in fact and not just in name.  O'Neal is often overwhelmed by the performances around him, and the lack of a good accent is annoying, even to Americans I should think.  That said, there is so much good here that I cannot give it less than five stars.  A couple of scenes bring goosebumps, without any special effects or manipulative music, and this is rare enough in itself to merit any number of stars.  The opening scene at cards is amazing, as is the scene with the German mother and her baby.  The first half of the movie, before Barry becomes a complete cad, is more engaging, but the second half is never boring or hard to watch.  The acting, direction, costumes, lighting, and script are all top-notch.  Kubrick did all he could with the book, I think--except choose a better title actor.  Also, this movie obviously gave the clue to Merchant/Ivory, and we should be grateful for that.  In terms of sympathy, Merchant/Ivory undoubtedly surpassed Kubrick on several occassions, but they never surpassed him in terms of cinematography.  This movie would be difficult to surpass in that regard.
B000005JA8|2.0|I have to say that I truly approached this album with an open mind. I've been reading the reviews, hearing the two sides of the arguement and I honestly can't say I agree with the ones that like it. <br /> <br />First of all, free jazz is one of my favorite forms of jazz. However, a good free jazz player (whether it's sax, piano, or even guitar) plays notes that he can anticipate, and go places he knows ahead of time. This is what I think makes a good free jazz musician. Anticipated free solos. Despite the fact that the notes in Beefhearts music are indeed anticipated, it definitely DOES NOT sound like it. As hard as they were practiced and as meticulously as the notes were blended together, it just sounds like a jumbled mess. <br /> <br />It's the kind of music that can just be playing in the background, then you finally realize it and say to yourself...\\"wait...what the hell am I listening to?\\"  <br /> <br />Beefheart's voice is unique (it's ragged and sounds almost constantly strained), and actually in the right context I would probably like it. Here, however, it just adds to the chaos. It's like listening to a train wreck, and Beefheart's voice is an explosion in one of the cars. But as I read the reviews, in retrospect I am surprised that it was exactly that which turned some of you on to this music. I guess I should filed under the category of \\"don't get it's.\\" <br /> <br />However, all this isn't to say that I don't appreciate what Beefheart did. Obviously as random and spontaneous as the notes are, it would take one hell of a time putting them all together. Beefheart did just this. It's for this very reason that \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" could be a work of pure genius. But like Einstein's theory of relativity, I want nothing to do with it.
B00000729S|5.0|I backed into The Monks in the early '90s, true to Monk form, in an unconventional way: I first bought bassist Eddie Shaw's autobiography, \\"Black Monk Time,\\" then bought the album. The story of five ex-American GIs and their musical adventures in mid-'60s West Germany was so incredibly, improbably wild that I thought there was no WAY an album could be as good as this. Silly me.  Years have passed since I bought into the amazing story of The Monks -- and nearly equally as many have passed since I saw them play their first-ever shows on their native soil (at Cavestomp '99, November 1999 in NYC) -- and it's astounding how this album, now 39 years old, has held up. It also astounds me how this music was created in such a vacuum. I mean, there was nothing with which to compare it, and there still isn't.  The Monks were the first and maybe the best and most ignored punk band of them all. Think of all the things they had going against them: A rock'n'roll band whose rhythm guitarist (Dave Day, ne Havlicek, from Hendrix's hometown of Renton, Wash.) was converted to rhythm banjo. A band whose bespectacled organist (Larry Spangler, aka Clark) sounded better suited for church music. A band whose drummer (Roger Johnston, d. Nov. 2004) beat out the rhythm with the big ol' butt end of his sticks. A band that accidentally discovered feedback (\\"Monk Time\\") around the time The Beatles were accidentally discovering it for \\"I Feel Fine.\\" A band that, in the days when everyone grew their hair long and wore mod clothes, cut their hair short, shaved tonsures into their skulls and wore nothing but black. A band whose singer (Gary Burger) was screaming \\"You know I hate you with a passion BAAAAYbeeee!\\" when other groups were singing about love. A band complaining about complication when everyone else was looking for simple songs to sing, telling people to \\"Shut UP!\\" when the rest of the music world was being more inclusive. A band whose antiwar stance pissed off people two years before it was hip (\\"Why do you kill all those kids over there in Vietnam? ... My brother died in Vietnam!\\" Gary screamed in \\"Monk Time\\"). Call them rebels or contrarians, but they were ahead of their time -- and save for the 'Nam references, their sounds of alienation and fury still sound fresh four decades later.  And they sure knew how to write pop songs for their parallel universe. \\"We Do Wie Du\\" came straight from The Ikettes' \\"I'm Blue.\\" \\"Higgledy Piggledy\\" rolled out a drum intro similar to that of \\"I Fought the Law,\\" Burger whipped up a nonsensical, whirling-dervish chant, and the band zoomed off into the stratosphere from there. \\"Oh How to Do Now\\" was equally maddening in its throbbing, screaming, bass-beating, organ-pounding frenzy. \\"Love Came Tumbling Down\\" was a perfect balance of banjo rhythm, organ passion, busy bottom-heavy rhythm and inspired vocal harmony, done in almost a military-sharp cadence.  It still astounds me how few people have heard \\"Black Monk Time.\\" I unleashed it on my barbecue friends at our weekly get-together a few months ago, including some old-school punks in their late 30s, and they're still shell-shocked. They had never heard anything like this. If you have any friends who profess to loving rock'n'roll or punk in particular, unleash this monster on them. More than ever (with one Monk recently deceased and the others now in their early 60s), not only is this one of the most essential rock'n'roll albums ever recorded, it's a key piece of the secret history of rock'n'roll that simply needs to be heard. Can you handle it?
0783232039|5.0|Ronny Yu should be proud as punch as his directorial efforts, aided by Don Mancini's clever script have brought new life into the Chucky franchise.  This fourth entry is the best since the original, and is filled with lots of great inside jokes and humorous lines.  But don't worry, there's lots of sick gore and perversion courtesy of Chucky and his new playmate, Tiffany.  Catch the opening sequence in the police evidence repository:  there's Michael Meyer's mask; Jason's hockey mask; a chainsaw; and Freddy Kruger's glove.  A keen eye will even catch the dolls from Puppetmaster in this insane gallery of horror movie memorabilia.  Some of the lines are hilarious, such as when Jesse asks the dolls how they got that way, Chucky says it was a long story and would probably take two or three sequels to tell it all.  Mancini's decision to leave Andy Barclay out of the picture opens the movie up to a wider range of characterizations.  Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile are attractive lovebirds; John Ritter is hilarious as the police chief; and of course Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif's voicings of the dolls is superb.  They actually became more \\"real\\" as their murderous lust and carnal desires became as one.  BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a refreshingly lively entry in the series and of course, with the movie's ending we know SEED OF CHUCKY is in the wings.
B000063UR2|4.0|The Director's Cut of LEGEND (which is far superior to the Theatrical Release) is an almost perfect film. It has the right dose of magic, tension, 'darkness', and fun to make it be one of those 80's films that can still be enjoyed by many today. The second-to-none use of actual special effects (such as mattes or blue screen) make the film just that much more real. The set and makeup designs are much better than some movies have today. The only thing stopping LEGEND from being a perfect movie in my eyes is that it ends before much else happens. It follows the story pleasently enough, but there is hardly any action in the entire film, even at the climax. In the commentary for this dvd, Ridley explains this is due to the budget of the film, which he did not want to go over, for there were originally scenes of 'action' in various parts of the film. And the film certainly had enough time for some action pieces, with the Director's Cut running only at an 1 hour and 40 minutes. I wouldn't have minded it being bumped to 2 hours to see some action. But it's all about the budgets. Anyway, the film is still better than most from the 80's, and it's visual style alone is what will make you want to watch it again and again. I reccomend it.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|Maverick is an awesome series.  The episodes selected for this DVD are among the most popular.  I just have one question:  why can't every episode be released on DVD as season box sets?  Other westerns are being released as season box sets, and it's utterly disappointing that Maverick is not.  I would snap up all the episodes as box sets in a heartbeat.  Warner Brothers should get a grip.  I will not buy the episodes piecemeal like this.
B00004VVND|4.0|Before Jurassic Park and Terminator, there was Westworld. A short (only 88 minutes or so) film by the famous writer Michael Crichton, who wrote the novel Jurassic Park, Congo, Timeline, and many others. This film is like a combo of his story for Jurassic Park (theme park where something goes wrong) and Terminator (robots that kill people). But it can be hardly blamed for being unoriginal, because it came out before either of those films/books. The film was a lot of fun to watch, and a bit cheesy at times, but it was from the 70's, did you think it wouldn't be cheesy? What stops the film from becomming completely unique is that it ends a bit too soon for me. Most of the movie just leads up to the robots freaking out on everyone, but it doesn't really show enough of them causing damage and attacking them. I heard they may remake this film, and if they do, they need to add more to the actual destruction by the robots (which I am sure they would). But besides that gripe, the film is enjoyable and original for it's time.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|Although the first season was excellent, in season 2 we get to meet a more mature cast with their ups and downs with typical high school kids problems living in a town full of secrets were nobody seems to be perfect even the Cohens. <br /> <br />In my opinion the show has lost some of its essence, they're no more cotillions, fashion show and fancy parties, instead we get to see them dealing with alcohol, drugs and sex issues. But I guess that's part of the show growing up and becoming what it is today.. a huge Pop-Culture phenomenon. <br /> <br />So... California here we come, up to season 3 (I admit it...I can't wait!!) <br /> <br />Enjoy!! <br />
B0009AM5I6|5.0|La Traviata is one of my favorite operas and this recording of the opera is one of the best I have seen. The sets, costumes, and acting and singing are first rate. Angela Gheorghiu is not only besutiful to the eye but also to the ear. I feel that she becomes Violetta in this production. Leo Nucci is fine as Germont and Frank Lopardo is excellant also. He even sings the cabaletta before De' miei bellenti spiriti. <br />If one had to one a Traviata, this one would be it.

B000089CJI|5.0|Recently I had never even heard of this band until my friend told me about them.  She got me the CD for my birthday and I have loved it ever since.  The lyrics are wonderful and I never get tired of them.  I especially like #4 and #10.  I think you should give this CD a try even if you are only slightly interested!  I know you'll love it!
B000065PUE|5.0|Doolittle is a curiously front loaded album.  That is, the songs that are hardest to listen to are all loaded in the front.  \\"Debaser\\" and \\"Tame\\" are great songs, especially if you pay attention to the lyrics, but the casual listener could quite possibly listen to these two openers and shelve the album permanently.  They might not be completely unjustified in doing that: the Pixies can often be out of tune, and out of sync with their own rhythyms, making them look like sloppy musicians.    But if the Pixies wanted to quickly gain fans, they would have started the album with either their poppiest or most insightful tunes: \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" or \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\" could both do.  That however, is not the Pixies' goal.  No matter how sloppy some of the songs seem, the Pixies really do think about their music, as evidenced by the brilliant track order.  How else can you explain the deliberate placement of \\"La La Love You\\" a seemingly sincere love song, right before \\"No. 13 Baby\\", a love song too, but one that is far more twisted.  The album is full of order decisions like this which work brilliantly.    The individual songs, too, have a tendency to be well-crafted, if the lyrics can be occaisonally oblique.  The themes aren't easy ones: self-mutilation and death come up several times in the lyrics.  But the latter theme sets the stage for the best song on the album (and the reasoning behind the cover art): \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\".  Somehow, despite the oddness of some of the lyrics on this number (\\"If the ground's not cold/Everything is going to burn\\", it's easy to understand what Black Francis means.  It's played excellently, and well-constructed.  It even has some subdued cello behind the raging guitars.  It's a much more subtle song than it first lets on, and a masterpiece.    That last sentence easily applies to the rest of the album.  \\"Doolittle\\" is worth a number of listens, simply because it reveals more with every hearing.  Anyone who listens to music, and not just pop garbage, should give this album a chance.
0679746048|4.0|I read the previous reviews and yet forgot that the story was not written in a linear fashion. That minor shock aside \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" was an unexpected treasure. I found Susanna Kaysen's story hit home in a very quiet manner. While reading her story the emotional weight of the individual glimpses into her life, as well as her overall life experience didn't hit me until after I had put the book down. It was an interesting view into a disorder that many live with everyday.<br /><br />If you are looking for the book version of the popular movie \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" this really isn't the book for you. While many of the stories from the book are also in the movie; there are many situations that take place in the movie that were never in the book. However, if you want a provocative and compelling look into the life of someone with BPD then I highly recommend this book.
0930289455|4.0|In this story we see of what the Joker is truly capable.  As the story proceeds, a more thorough investigation into the Joker's origin captivates readers.   <br />   In addition, the Joker's true philosophy of life is revealed.  His actions which seem so unpredictable are given a strangely satisfying explanation.   <br />   I still cringe when I look at the picture of the Joker when he performs the \\"Killing Joke.\\"  He is a demon of unparalleled evil as he flippantly destroys human life.  This book has an ending that I still marvel over, which I obviously cannot, and will not, give away; it is one of the best literary uses of irony that I have yet seen.

B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This group is just plain godawful, I Can't even believe that many people think this is the best album of the year, system has always been a bad rock band, this album should have called the headache, I Despise this band, I Understand they don't like bush and I Agree with them, but enough is enough, this is a tired retread of the 1998 album which was much better than this. <br /> <br />This is the G-Unit of the political rap rock world. <br /> <br />Thumbs way down for me. <br />
B000003S0F|3.0|...but still a mediocre effort when compared to anything King Crimson has done after the early years, such as RED, DISCIPLINE, and THRAK.  I recognize this as a *fair* Crimson album, mainly because of two songs I love - 'Ladies of the Road' and 'Sailor's Tale.'    'Sailor's Tale' is a driving instrumental with a hypnotic bass line from Boz Burrell.  Halfway through the song, Fripp rips into a masterful solo comprised of chords only.  The whole song is a journey into an hallucinogenic void. 'Ladies of the Road,' is a song about (...) groupies:  \\"Two-fingered levi'd sister/ said 'Peace,' I stopped and kissed her/ said 'I'm a male resister,'/ I smiled and just unzipped her.\\"      The rest of the album is OK, and has some decent moments, especially some great sax playing from Mel Collins.  However, if you took the two good songs from this CD, and combined them with 'Cat Food,' 'Cadence and Cascade,' and 'Cirkus,' Fripp and the boys could have saved themselves some time and money, instead of releasing IN THE WAKE, LIZARD, and ISLANDS.      If you're going to own one album other than IN THE COURT from the early years, it should be ISLANDS, but don't get too excited!  If you want to hear some truly amazing King Crimson, check out some of their later music instead.

B0000025RI|5.0|'Thriller' stands out in all contemporary music as a 'must-own' album in anyone's music collection.  It was the album that really put Michael Jackson 'on the map,' especially as an entity separate from the Jackson 5.  It's also culturally relevant, because it caused an African American to gain international stardom on a level previously unheard of for ANYONE.  Something like that never would have happenned in the USA 50 years ago.   <br /> <br />There were also *7* top ten hits from this record!  When Michael Jackson performed 'Billy Jean' live for a motown reunion show, and first introduced his wild stage performance, it launched the singer into the upper echelons of fame.  <br /> <br />The music takes a new turn from Jackson's OFF THE WALL - it is much darker on THRILLER, and this gives a new life to the music; an originality lacking in his earlier work.  Not only do we get Quincy Jones as a producer again, but we also have cameos from Eddie Van Halen on 'Beat It' and Paul McCartney on 'The Girl is Mine.'  There's a funny monologue at the end of the latter where the two singers are having an argument: Paul says 'Michael, we're not gonna fight about this, OK' and Michael says 'Paul, I thought I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter!'   <br /> <br />The most popular songs here are probably the title track, 'Beat It,' and 'Billy Jean,' a song about a crazy fan who stalked Jackson, claiming that she was having his baby.  When recording the music video for 'Thriller,' Jackson was informed that the content of zombies and the paranormal went against his religion, as Jackson was a Jehovah's Witness.  There was eventually a disclaimer to be placed in the beginning of the video, put ended up being pulled last minute.  I guess Jackson didn't really care - he was rich! <br /> <br />I won't attempt to critique the musical style, because I feel that as a fan of mostly Jazz and Rock, I lack the knowledge to write a critical analysis. I will say that it's an album I still enjoy listening to quite frequently, and it's a record that I sincerely believe will continue to be huge in the decades to come.  There aren't really songs you'll want to skip over.  Apart from the more popular songs, we have the upbeat 'Wanna Be Startin Something' but on the other side of the coin, Jackson still delivers with the ballad, 'The Lady in My Life.'  His musical versatility is at a peak. <br /> <br />Most importantly, we cannot let the artist's private life shadow our judgment of the music itself.  Even if Jackson were found guilty, this should not make the listening experience any less pleasurable.  There are plenty of other rock stars and famous celebrities who have issues, and we frown upon them.  However, we must also separate the artist from the creation.  If you don't own any Michael Jackson, this album is the best place to start.  You will not be disappointed.

B00005JNJT|5.0|In Star Wars style, \\"Batman Begins\\", the fifth installment of the Batman franchise, presents the story of the early days of the superhero, from his childhood and his deepest fears, to his personal pursuit to leave those very fears behind, into the birth of his alter ego and his first days fighting crime and injustice in Gotham City.<br /><br />The story is beyond enticing. While it could have spared some \\"Bond\\"-like moments that make me scratch my head feeling treated like a silly moviegoer, most of it takes you in with ease. I particularly loved the evolutionary process Bruce Wayne goes through during his remote \\"retreat\\", in order to defeat his fears and overcome his insecurities. The way he gradually builds up Batman and his gear also results in a mix of fun and cool. Morgan Freeman resulted a key character to make this happen.<br /><br />Special effects and sound effects are top of the line. I didn't feel particularly overwhelmed by them at any moment (though it does get pretty noisy some times). Production design of Gotham City was gorgeous. I loved the details in the monorail and the gothic arches it went through as it glided over the city, for example. The batmobile was absolutely B-A-D (as in cool).<br /><br />As a whole, I loved it. I have been a fan of Batman since I was a boy and I continue to love the character. I am happy the franchise hasn't sold out even after five installments. Seems like Memento's Christopher Nolan was a worthy heir of the first ones, put out by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher.

6305910189|4.0|\\"The Wrath of Khan\\" was the second of the Star Trek movies and focuses on the crew of the original television series. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, who also made a significant but uncredited contribution to the screenplay, it hit the movie screens in 1982. <br /> <br />The film opens in 2285 during a 'Kobayashi Maru' simulation at Starfleet Academy - this is a no-win situation, designed to test the character and resolve of Starfleet's prospective command officers. Many, though not all, of the trainees are cadets - for this simulation, for example, a Vulcan Lieutenant called Saavik is in the captain's chair. Several senior officers have roles to play, including Spock, Sulu, Uhura and McCoy. Admiral Kirk, meanwhile, is the assessing officer. The final stage of training is a three-week training mission on a real starship - in this case, the Enterprise. Officially, Captain Spock will be in command, though Kirk will also be onboard to continue assessing the trainees. <br /> <br />Chekov, meanwhile, has been assigned to the USS Reliant as first officer. Commanded by Captain Terrell, it has been ordered to find a lifeless planet in the Mutara Sector for use in the Genesis Project. This top-secret program  is led by Dr. Carol Marcus, one of the Federation's leading molecular biologists. Her team has developed the Genesis Device - an item that can reorganise a planet's structure at the subatomic level, changing a dead planet into one capable of supporting life. Carol Marcus' son, David, has also contributed greatly to the project - though, unlike his mother, he doesn't have much time for Starfleet. He particularly doesn't like an officer his mother was once acquainted with : an 'overgrown boy-scout' called James Kirk. Unfortunately, that overgrown boy-scout is his father...and (whoops !) his mother just hasn't got round to telling him yet.  <br /> <br />The movie's villain is Khan Noonien Singh, one of a group of genetically engineered humans whose treatment of the 'ordinary'human population led to the Eugenic Wars. A group of roughly eighty subsequently escaped Earth on a 'sleeper' ship, travelling in suspended animation. Kirk, while captain on the Enterprise, discovered their ship and subsequently marooned the on Ceti Alpha V - this encounter was covered in \\"Space Seed\\", an episode on the original series. However, when a neighbouring planet exploded a few years later the side effects changed the orbits of Khan's new home and left it a barren wasteland. When Chekov, looking for a lifeless planet, arrives with his new commanding officer he initially doesn't realise where they are due to these changes. Unfortunately, they are captured by Khan - who having spent the years blaming Kirk for his plight, now plans to take control of the Reliant and exact his revenge.  <br /> <br />A great deal of credit for \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" must go to Nicholas Meyer - he directed the film and was an uncredited contributor to the screenplay. (He was also involved with the funniest Trek movie, \\"The Voyage Home\\", and my own favorite, \\"The Undiscovered Country\\"). Meyer, who'd never previously watched the show, was delighted when he was shown the \\"Space Seed\\" episode and immediately identified Khan as his vengeful villain - a role that Ricardo Montalban returns to. Kirstie Alley, taking a break from serving beer to Norm Petersen, makes her debut as Saavik - a role she was to reprise in the next two films. As for David Marcus - with a libido like Kirk's, it was only a matter of time before he bumped into his offspring. Merritt Butrick also reprised this role in the following movie, and later appeared in a TNG episode called \\"Symbiosis\\". For many, \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" is the best of the Star Trek movies - there's plenty of action, it has a huge climax and is definitely recommended.
B000002LIR|3.0|Rod Stewart has had one of the oddest careers in rock history. Blessed with a true whiskey soaked blues growl, he has gone from using this gift to create some of the best rockers ever, along side some of the lamest \\"hits\\" to make it up the charts. This collection covers the years 1964-1990, leaving plenty of room for the best and worst of Stewart. <br />Disc 1 starts with a few blues covers where you can hear Stewart trying to find his comfort zone. There are a couple of winners here; \\"I've been Drinkin' Again,\\" shows a real feel for the lyrics and  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" gives a glimpse at what is to come. But this CD takes off when it hits Stewart's self-penned \\"Gasoline Alley.\\" For the next 6 songs you get to hear Stewart emerge as a major talent.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 continues in a true \\"greatest hits\\" vein. \\"Maggie May,\\" Reason to Believe,\\" \\"Every Picture Tells a Story,\\" just one classic after the next; mix in The Faces and you have Stewart at his best. This is  really the 5 star part of this compilation. <br /> <br />Disc 3 starts well with \\"Sailing\\" and \\"Stone Cold Sober,\\" but things start to get shaky when we head into the period that I think of \\"Smarmy\\" Stewart. Songs like \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" and \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy \\" start popping up and while today they may be thought of a self parody, at the time it just seemed like Stewart was just really pleased with himself. \\"Hot Legs\\" just escapes this by being a true rocker but this CD shows where Stewart's heading and it leads down to... <br /> <br />Disc 4 where every song sounds the same and Stewart's career takes a nose dive. \\"Love Touch\\" or \\"Forever Young, anybody? <br />The cover of Waits's \\"Downtown Train is listenable so at least it ends on a moment of hope. <br /> <br />The liner notes by Rod himself are rather revealing as he condemns some of the choices flat out (\\"Pinball Wizard\\"- \\"I have no opinion of this rendition.\\") and defends some others (\\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\"- \\"Most of the public loved it,all the critics hated it. I can understand both positions.\\") in a manner that is humorous and insightful. <br />It's a tough call. It's Rod Stewart- warts and all. I find enough here to make it worth the price, but a more discerning buyer might want to check out a more concise greatest hits collection. <br />
0312995423|2.0|Apparantly I'm one of the few people in, oh, the world that didn't think The Da Vinci Code was that great.  I recognized in Dan Brown's writing the ability to generate tension and plot stress and keep it at powerful levels.  But, let's be honest, his prose is flimsy and utilitarian in rather juvenile ways.  His characters generally lack any kind of meaningful depth.  And finally, the thorough and impressive range of research to be found in the text masks a series of riddles and twists that, at heart, are weakly drawn and, well, kinda silly.<br /><br />That having been said, I want to point out that, for the tastes to which it is geared, Brown's writing does the trick.  Although I didn't find Da Vinci Code or Digital Fortress to be any great shakes, they both drew me in and held me in suspense.  Sure, I found them just this side of ludicrous, and I was moderately annoyed by the pedestrian writing, but, hey, I still read them all the way through.  Brown has a way of getting his readers to say, \\"Just one more chapter.\\"<br /><br />And, in fact, I actually enjoyed Digital Fortress more than The Da Vinci Code.  The later seemed to be more of a glorified conspiracy theorist's textbook than a thriller.  The Digital Fortress has its share of high-brow moments, but it is, at heart, a suspense novel with the requisite high-speed chases, escalating body count, and double-double crosses.<br /><br />I can see how the text might make more discriminating readers impatient and annoyed: the weak premises, the over-wrought emotional moments, the hastily rationalized contrivances.  However, I can also see how those readers interested in a fat-free bit of pulp would gobble this book up with both hands: the keep-you-guessing set-up, the easily digestible writing, the self-gratifying mind-benders.<br /><br />Still, taking a larger view, I have to side more with the discriminating readers than anyone else.  No matter what brief diversions this book may offer, it still represents only a shadow of what both Brown and the genre is able to offer.  Consider the stereotypical computer analyst characters, the overly zealous and eccentric hitman, the Hallmark-esque romantic moments, the last big puzzle with its glaringly obvious solution that an entire cadre of NSA specialists and experts still couldn't get until the...very...last...second.<br /><br />So, pick up this book about code-breaking, the halls of power, and globe-trotting assassins if you're in the mood for an hour or two of mostly flavor-free fun, but anyone looking for an insightful and serious book of depth and intelligence should look elsewhere.ly a shadow of what both Brown and the genre is able to offer.

B00065MDRW|5.0|Originally released in 1969, this was of course King Crimson's very first effort. Truly a timeless, near-impossible-to match progressive 'acid' ? rock classic. Remember hearing this when it first came out as it sort of scared me, I was only like ten at the time. I know several fans that say this and the following two Crimson lp's, 'In The Wake Of Poseidon' and 'Lizard' are the only three Crimson albums you need. Not sure if I agree with that. Tracks here are simply so fantastic I could maybe listen to this disc every other day. Starts off with with the rocking \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", the soft-spoken chiller \\"I Talk To The Wind\\", \\"Epitaph\\", the twelve-minute adventurous \\"Moonchild\\" and the title cut \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\". Original line-up of Robert Fripp - guitar, Greg Lake - bass & vocals, Ian McDonald - mellotron, reed, vibes & keyboards, Michael Giles - drums and Peter Sinfield - words & illuminations. SURE didn't last long, did it? Recently, I purchased several of those band-released 'live' archive shows, from this very tour and believe me, all you need are a couple of those. Most highly recommended.

0345457684|5.0|This book was a real pleasure to read and one I would recommend. A sci-fi-noire. Sort of a Raymond Chandler novel with more action, more violence, more sex and lots of futuristic technology ideas. (Actually lots of sex and violence, so this book isn't for everyone.) The writing is clear and easy to read. The story has many interesting characters and there are many plot twists. The book also introduces an interesting idea of converting people into a digital form and what that might mean. I don't know if all the plot twists really hold water in the end, but im glad that I went along for the ride.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I own all of Pink's albums, Try This, Mizzundastood, and Can't Take Me Home, and \\"Try This\\" is definetely her best album to date.<br /><br />Her image and strong voice didn't really suit the pop music that the record label was placing her against.<br /><br />Working with Rancid's Tim Armstrong, and the legendary Linda Perry, Pink trully found her calling on this album.<br /><br />From the opening guitar riff of \\"Trouble\\" to the almost Kanye West sounding \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\", and further on into \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\" a Blondie-esque tune, Pink struck it right with this under-selling album.<br /><br />She deserves a lot of props for Try This. It's a big step away from her start with \\"Most Girls\\" and \\"You Make Me Sick\\". It's also more suiting for her voice and image.<br /><br />There's a sound here for everyone. Pink really opened up lyrically, writing on all of the songs, and working very obviously side-by-side with Tim Armstrong and the other writers and producers. Peaches makes a guest appearance on Pink's self-proclaimed \\"sex\\" song \\"Oh My God\\", which is, indeed, a VERY sensual song.<br /><br />The ballads are good as well, too, but not as note worthy as her more rock-driven songs. I didn't find a single song on the album that felt to me like \\"filler\\", nor did I find many problems with the album.<br /><br />There's a hidden song called \\"Hooker\\" tacked on at the end of the album. It's kind've funny.<br /><br />The bonus DVD features the video for \\"Trouble\\", directed by Sophie Muller, who produced several of No Doubt's \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" era videos, and an inverview on her \\"Try This\\" album.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe that everyone should \\"Try This\\" and see what they think, you might be impressed.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|i've  been  waiting  for  this  DVD  to be  released  ever since  i  saw  the  eagles  live  in  melbourne  not  once  but THREE  of  there  five  concerts  at  melbourne.  the quality  of  the  sound  and  picture  is  second  to  none!  it  was  as  if  i  was  going  to  see  them  for  a  forth  time!  after  seeing  the  eagles  live  there was  a  lot  to  live  up  to  espically  arter  hell  freezes  over,  but  let  me  tell  you  they  have  done  themselves  proud.  like  fine  wine  they  just  keep  getting  better  with  age!
B0001AP12G|5.0|overall this album is one of the best.  its a late review but i just found out how to enter these. lol. late registration will be a hit also. <br /> <br />Top 5 <br />Get Em High <br />Jesus Walks <br />All Falls Down <br />Family Business <br />Breathe In Breathe Out <br /> <br />Only song i didnt like was the new workout plan. it was just to annoying
B000089CKH|5.0|When i first listened to this band i thought they were british, or european, at least..because this trio seem to deliver high quality brit pop these days.Coldplay,Travis and many of the likes end up sounding the same, but that does not happen here.Check out the sound of these 3 New Yorkers and find out that they are distinct,classy,gorgeus.I never get bored of Matt Caws voice.I owned their previous cd proximity effect,which was rawer,edgier and powerful but this release is pure melodic delight.No doubt, this is the best album i`ve listened to in 2005 and their new cd will be in the stores in just two months.I can`t wait until then! Get it.

B0007TKNI8|1.0|Talk about ruining a good story! I thought that the first thing you need in a musical are people who can sing! Ms Rossum had a decent voice, but I felt it was a bit too thin to really blow me away. I'm not familiar with any of her other work, but she managed to go through the entire Phantom movie with only one facial expression. There was absolutely no emotion whatsoever.(Whenever I saw her I kept thinking of the Latina woman in the Chorus Line movie). <br />The guy who did Raoul had a decent singing voice, probably the best of them all, but he did look completely redicilous with this long hair and sideburns. <br />The Phantom....OH COME ON! Could they have cast a person with LESS singing talent??? He shouts through most of the movie, and when he attempts to sing it's totally off key. Angel of music my ass.  <br />And why on earth did he wear a mask?? The man was a hunk, not a horrible disfigured freak.  <br />Although the set was impressive I felt that the whole thing was a bit \\"too Hollywood\\", and certainly a far cry from the original novel.
1573223085|4.0|What I have gotten from this book is that we are moving into an era of American renaissance-- where the right side of the brain finally has parity with the left side.  In other words, science, art, the concepts of beauty, quality, and innovativeness will all play an important role in defining our culture.   <br /> <br />I just hope he is right (hey the Italians did it, why can't we?)-- and may it last 500 years!!
B00008NRI8|3.0|Hugh Grant was charming and funny yes, Sandra was clumsy and cute, exactly what i expected. It was a cute, romantic, funny, movie that offered some laughs here and there, it is a movie that you can just enjoy. However like all romantic comedys, it will end in such a predictable way that you know it from the beginning of the movie. The guy will make a bunch of mistakes but end up getting the girl anyway. I'm not saying I wanted it to end where she rejected him, that wouldn't be any fun, but I am saying that maybe if they would have skipped the whole, dramatic speechs, and kept it funny it would have been more original, and enjoyable.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Yet, there is something warm about the movie, but I enjoy the more original ideas in other Sandra movies like While you were sleeping, and Hope Floats. Still she is very good in this movie, its worth renting on DVD, or watching on TV.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album came out in the year 1987.  NOT 1986.  AND THE ALBUM 'TEN' BY PEARL JAM DID NOT COME OUT UNTIL 1991, SO DON'T LISTEN TO THE MORON WHO SAID IT WAS BETTER SINCE HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EITHER ALBUM.      THE GREATEST DEBUT ALBUM BY FAR IS 'ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?' BY THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE.      THIS ALBUM KICKS ASS.  WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, MR. BROWNSTONE, PARADISE CITY AND SWEET CHILD O' MINE ARE ALL UNDENIABLE CLASSICS.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|First off I like the thrash/death/black metal bands such as Death, Testament, Dimmu Borgir, Morbid Angel and Nile.  If you like any of the bands I have just listed you'll want to check out this cd from Behemoth.  No song on this cd is a \\"filler\\" and there isn't overuse of blastbeats thanks to their drummer, Inferno.  The production quality on this album is very good and the vocals (sort of black metal sounding) come through the mix clearly.
B00018D3RI|5.0|forget the movie..... buy the tv show dvd's.. and enjoy. i have all 3 seasons,
B000066NW0|5.0|1. Losing Grip  -A song about letting go of a relationship after a breakup, realizing the guy wasn't ever there for her in the first place. It has a great rock, energetic, kick ass vibe to it. I love the chorus expecially where she belts out. \\"Why should I even care?\\" 5/5    2. Complicated -About someone who changes who he is to fit in around his friends. Something so many do, and Avril sings that  she just likes him the way he already is. No doubt this one was a  hit, because at the time, it was a refreshing change of pace to be heard on the radio for a change. 5/5    3. Sk8er Boi -I love songs that tell stories, and have some sort of message behind it when you actually sit down and read the lyrics. This one is an entire story really. About a girl who likes a guy, but wont date him because of what \\"crowd\\" he is in, and it has a twist at the end of it.  5/5    4. I'm With You -The first soft ballad on the cd. It's about feeling lonely and vulnerable, and missing someone you've never really met, hoping the person of your dreams is really out there.  I found this one to be really pretty. 5/5      5. Mobile -The first unreleased track. I really loved this one. Its about making changes, and moving forward. Great beat, lyrics, everything. \\"I'm waking up to say I tried instead of waking up to another tv guide.\\" 5/5!     6. Unwanted -This first track on the cd that I wasn't really crazy about. Simply as its titled, about a person who keeps shutting her out and ignoring her. It has a different kind of beat to it, but great rocking guitars, and lots of emotion. 4/5     7. Tomorrow - A softer, acoustic ballad. I LOVE this one. It's hard to describe the feeling this song gives off. It's about being pessimistic that things aren't going to work out when someone tells you, but having faith that you might be able to change yourself \\"tomorrow.\\"  5/5     8. Anything But Ordinary -Great song. Great lyrics. It's a song about wondering if life is really worth it, but still wanting to feel some excitement and not let it all go to waste. A sad song, but very inspiring at the same time. 5/5     9. Things I'll Never Say -This is kind of in continuation of the last track in a way. Wanting some excitement. It's a song about things we say in our head, but are afraid to say out loud. 5/5     10. My World - A bit of an autobiography about the place where Avril grew up. A small town, where there's nothing to do. Something you can relate to, and what its like to live an everday, average life, and wondering where it will all end up. 4/5     11. Nobody's Fool -Different. She raps a bit in here, but she sounds really good. (just try singing this, its kinda tough) This song has a great flow to it, and good lyrics. She's singing that she can see through when people want to change her. 5/5     12. Too Much To Ask -A lof of people would be able to relate to this one. It's about liking a guy. Where he acts like he doesn't care, is cold and tough, but she can see right through it. 4/5    13. Naked -One of the more pop sounding tracks on the cd. It's about being with a guy, being happy, and having him see right through you. Being able to be your true self and are accepted. A refreshing way to end off the cd. :) 5/5    So, as you can see, every song has a different topic, and story to tell. There are absolutely no filler tracks. The lyrics, music, emotion, are all really good. If you've gone through some tough relationships, or tough times, and want to hear a cd with some diversity in the songs, then I reccomend you pick this one up. I listen to all kinds of music, and although Avril is mainstream, and overhyped, liked by little kids, in all honesty, this is still a really good cd no matter who you are.
B000003NA3|5.0|I would place this collection of recordings alongside My Favorite Things, Giant Steps, Ascension and A Love Supreme as defining the icon status accorded John Coltrane. As thrilling as some of his serpentine vertical solos are on both tenor and soprano, the context and daring framework he provides is reciprocated by great performances from his own quartet, plus some of Eric Dolphy's best work. (The dialogue of horns is remarkable, matched only by Trane's brief encounter with Sonny Rollins on \\"Tenor Madness\\" some years previous.) The octet/nonet pieces presaged the brilliance later found on Ascension, a landmark of modern jazz where Trane also worked with double rhythm sections as he does on some of the tracks here. The feeling of utter spirituality achieved in the pristine solos of A Love Supreme are also reached often in this setting, and as other reviewers have stated, there is a transcendent quality to this music, one that extends beyond the core of the spiritual black experience that had been engendered in much of the best jazz from Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives right up to that time (and expereinec realyed with rage and a sad poignancy), only to come full circle through the now- burgeoning influence of Eastern scales, drones, and a shimmering aura of peaceful transition. Coltrane's music is indeed in transition here, and could be said to contain both the furious \\"chickens come home to roost\\" voice of a Malcolm X before his trip to Mecca, as well as the voice that came home, offering a brand of new peace into the still violent and too-dinterested world the pilgrim left behind. All of that is here; great jazz, great world music, great sprituality, plus recorded sound of distinctive excellence. The stereo balances and individual isolations of instruments are marvelous. This is especially striking in the clarity of McCoy Tyner's and the various bass and drum accompanients (and one may be right to consider Jones' drums actually a sort of leadlead instrument throughout). I would agree with one reviewer the McCoy Tyner's piano does not always sound beautiful (in fact, in his harsh chords the distortion I think comes from Tyner himself in the pounded vehemence of his block chords, and not from any mike overload) but it does sound REAL. Indeed,the recording has astonishing clarity, and I suggest you play it loud, as if you were in the first or second row of tables. Just let this sound wash over you. For newcomers, I would still point them to My Favorite Things or Miles Davis's Kind of Blue, followed perhaps by A Love Supreme. But for me the core of Coltrane's art, soul, and genius are in Ascension and in this large set of truly remarkable live recordings. The initiated have to come to these recordings to really know Coltrane, and to appreciate the real depths and thresholds of modern jazz. So take a chance, buy it anyway, and sometime, earlier or later, you WILL finf yourself astounded and humbled simultanously..

B0009HLDFU|5.0|As with other double albums like \\"The White Album\\" or Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk,\\" \\"In Your Honor\\" takes a few listens to really get into it. The idea of splitting the songs into electric and acoustic is intriguing at first, but it does makes monotony a problem when it wouldn't otherwise. The great thing about \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" was the contrast of softer songs when sandwiched between the heavy songs, and vice versa. Now imagine bunching those songs into distinct halves, and it would suffer greatly.<br /><br />That's the problem with \\"In Your Honor,\\" but a simple solution would change a lot of initial opinions about the album: Give it a few more listens, decide what the fat is and trim it, then combine and mix up the two discs a bit. Then make a loaner copy... and make sure everyone you know listens to it.<br /><br />The weaker stuff for me was the title track (the false ending isn't enough to save it), \\"Free Me\\" (a screamer song that just  strains), \\"Hell,\\" \\"Deepest Blues,\\" and \\"Over and Out.\\" \\"Friend of a Friend,\\" an old Grohl song that is no doubt personal, just isn't interesting enough musically to warrant repeated listens.<br /><br />Now onto the good stuff (in my preferred order):<br /><br />\\"No Way Back\\" is a solid up-tempo song; a better intro for the album.<br /><br />\\"Still\\" is a sweet-but-haunting adolescent suicide pact (with a \\"Mr. Kite\\"-ish outro).<br /><br />\\"Best of You\\" sounds a little like \\"Times Lke These\\" in spots, but ultimately it's one of their best ever mid-tempo rockers.<br /><br />\\"What If I Do\\" is a gentle, lazy-afternoon ditty; the \\"Ain't It the Life\\" sort of number we missed on \\"One by One.\\"<br /><br />\\"Miracle\\" is sheer beauty, the \\"Aurora\\" of the bunch. By the time those violins break in, you'll either have a lump in your throat or a moist eye. Maybe one of the band's all-time top five.<br /><br />\\"DOA\\" is a fun, rambunctious rocker with a pseudo-tribal drumbeat. Chorus sounds a bit like a faster \\"Live-In Skin.\\"<br /><br />\\"Another Round\\" has a waltzy beat and a swell harmonica solo.<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is one of the most infectious breakup songs ever made; a simple, peppy pop-rock gem in the mold of the b-side \\"Fraternity.\\"<br /><br />\\"On the Mend\\" is a dreamy, ethereal acoustic number.<br /><br />\\"Resolve\\" is a little long and the chorus gets a bit repetitive (problems that aren't as bad on \\"IYH\\" as they were on \\"One by One\\"). But those harmony vocals are a saving grace. Sounds a bit like a slower \\"Overdrive.\\"<br /><br />\\"Virginia Moon\\" is the kind of song a few macho hard-rock-types would probably love to make if they could get away with it. It took serious guts for Dave Grohl of \\"All My Life\\" fame to create a tongue-in-cheek Bacharach-type duet with Norah Jones (thank God he didn't ask Vanessa Carlton instead!). Some back-and-forth vocals in between the harmonic stuff would've made this perfect.<br /><br />\\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" is something you wished Disc 2 had a lot more of by the time you get around to it. A fun, easy-going, summer song.<br /><br />\\"End Over End\\" is a catchy closer, better served by following it up with the gentle \\"Razor,\\" an absolutely melancholic song with a lullaby feel (appropriately enough, given Josh Homme's presence).<br /><br />So, a few inevitable weak spots aside, this is easily the best album since TCATS... and a breath of fresh air amidst all of today's blustery joyless alt-rock, and bland insipid AC-pop. Give this a second chance, and you'll thank the stars these guys are still out there fightin' Foo in your honor.f the most infectious breakup songs ever made; a simple, peppy pop-rock gem in the mold of the b-side \\"Fraternity.\\"    \\"On the Mend\\" is a dreamy, ethereal acoustic number.    \\"Resolve\\" is a little long and the chorus gets a bit repetitive (problems that aren't as bad on \\"IYH\\" as they were on \\"One by One\\").

B0002FR07O|4.0|I know that many in progressive rock fandom will say that this was the last great progressive effort by Porcupine Tree but I say it is the start of something beautiful, to borrow a phrase from their latest outing.  It finds a balance between instrumental epics and more traditional songs, and it is in the songs that this album shines.  \\"Dark Matter\\" may be my favorite song by Porcupine Tree, and in addition to it this album includes other excellent tracks like \\"Sleep of no Dreaming\\", \\"Sever\\", and the instrumental \\"Signify\\".  PT's sound here has a much more dreamy, hypnotic feel to it than on their latest discs, but I think this disc is the one which really started them in the direction they are currently on. <br /> <br />As for the bonus disc, well, you might think since it is a collection of demos it is sort of a throwaway.  Not so!  Yes, it lacks the polish and rich tapestry of sounds the studio albums have, yet stripped to the essence of the music these tracks really shine.  I picked this album up at a recent concert the band gave and as I tend not to be a big fan of long space rock tunes I was a but nervous, as this is considered a more progressive sounding period for the band.  Well I havent regretted the purchase one bit. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, go see them live whenever you can!  They put on a great show!
B0009353IW|2.0|I've been a big fan of Mr. Cooder's previous work (ex., see my customer review of Mambo Sinuendo), but I literally fell asleep while listening to this album.  So after listening to it again while AWAKE, I'd like to be more specific about my disappointment.  I think the basic problem is the \\"concept album\\" idea behind Ry's reflection on an aspect of his SoCal childhood.  There are a few mildly catchy and/or entertaining songs, but there's also WAY too much mumbling about topics such as the persecution of suspected \\"Reds.\\"  The vocals are sometimes pretty awful, whether Mr. Cooder's or a guest's.  And too many of the songs just drag along with a very slow tempo.  I'm sure this will appeal to a very narrow audience of people who live in the Chavez Ravine area, or those interested in California history.  But I'm also very sure I won't be the only Cooder fan making a beeline to get rid of this turkey.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I had reviewed this disc a couple months ago and I gave it our stars.  My reason: it's great but not quite \\"In Absentia\\" level.  After several more listens I have to say I was flat out wrong.  Its better. <br /> <br />\\"In Absentia\\" was a bit of a departure of Porcupine Tree into a harder sound.  Deadwing continues that but I feel in many ways it returns to the more progressive elements, fusing them with the more modern sound in a way which floors me.  Tracks like \\"Deadwing\\", \\"Arriving Somewhere But not Here\\", and \\"Strt of Something Beautiful\\" are epic, thoroughly fantastic, and totally different from what is played out on popular radio today.  \\"Lazarus\\" is sublime, with lush harmonies plaid over a simple but beautiful melody.  But \\"In Absentia\\" had great songs too.  Deadwing surpasses it by being more of an album.   <br /> <br />An album but not a rock opera, mind you, which tells a story in a chronological fashion.  Deadwing doesnt really tell a story per se, though it is influenced by one.  As a result, the songs are like looking at the series of self-portraits by Van Goh.  Each is of the same subject and yet totally fresh and original, revealing new aspects of character, of life's burdens, of life's joys. I feel that Deadwing achieves this by peering at a tragic tale from slghtly different perspectives in the songs.  The result is a fantastic album, full of fantastic songs.  <br /> <br />Give it a listen and you'll enjoy it.  Give it a couple and you'll realize just how great it is!
B00005JKNC|5.0|Frank Darabont has created a wonderful and nostalgic film with echos of Frank Capra everywhere. The lush cinematography, with its colorful hues, help create and enhance a very special movie that will leave you wondering why films like this don't get made anymore.<br /><br />Jim Carrey completely loses himself in a quiet and underplayed role which could easily have garnered him an Oscar if anyone had been watching. This is an old-style film and Carrey gives an old-style performance as Peter Appleton. After an horrific car accident, he loses his memory and is mistaken and embraced by an entire town as Luke. Luke is a long missing and beloved son of both his father and the town.<br /><br />Martin Landau gives a wonderful performance as always. The same can be said of Adele Stanton, as the pretty Laurie Holden, Luke's girlfriend and touchstone for all that really matters in life. James Whitmore and David Ogden Stiers are just two of the many faces you will recognize in this lovely portrait of a small town in 1950's America. An entire community comes together to help restore its once great movie theatre, \\"The Majestic,\\" where magic filled the screens every weekend.<br /><br />Like any Capra film, Darabont's movie takes its time to unfold. The basic story is surrounded by small insights into ourselves and how we live. Does what people expect of us make us better? If we become better than who we were, where do we belong then? Peter will have to answer these questions when he remembers who he is. He has come to love Laurie and his 'father' Landau, and may no longer be Peter; at least not the old Peter.<br /><br />The town who feels betrayed by their favorite son is not the only problem Peter/Luke must deal with. The communist witch hunts of the fifties are in full force and he must go back and face the committee. But who he is now may change how he answers the questions. Once he figures out where he belongs, he must find out if he can live the life he chooses.<br /><br />This long and beautiful film is truly special. The last ten minutes of this old-style masterpiece reminds us of all that is good about the movies. If you are lucky enough to be seeing this for the first time, I envy you. If you didn't give this film a chance the first time around, give it another try.<br /><br />\\"The Magic is Right Here, The Trick is to See It\\"--Martin Landauial.

B000021XS0|2.0|I have just finished my (approximately) 12th listening of this album... and I hate it just as much as the first time. Could they have played any more ponderously? This is the musical equivalent of talking down to someone.<br /><br />Which is *such* a shame, because the story behind the album is such a neat idea, and was meant to complement the prototype Dream Theater album, Images and Words.<br /><br />Why does that translate into an album that's geared, musically, towards a midwestern Baptist church-going audience? I have no idea... must just have been what was going through their minds at the time.  Two beautiful ballads, and a very cool intro... but all of them bridges, and not really what we're here for.<br /><br />Fans of Awake, Images, and Train of Thought should pay no more than the lowest used price for this cd. It speaks volumes that DT has not created a single track since that'd belong on this album.
B00013RC66|5.0|You can just about forget everyone else in this film other than Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. This sexy film is basically a two person film noir shot in bright colors, some of it in Hawaii. It is filled with excitement and seduction. Both the leads are wonderful to watch, their chemistry magnificent in this Bob Rafelson (Man Trouble, Five Easy Pieces) film.<br /><br />Debra Winger is Alex Barnes, bogged down in a government desk job dealing with statistics. But when she sees a pattern of deaths that lead to Theresa Russell, a dangerously beautiful woman with ice in her veins, she becomes obsessed with catching a killer. Theresa Russell, who has used more names than Jason Bourne, is just as smart as she is sexy, and almost the entire film is one long seduction scene as Russell spins her web around Alex.<br /><br />It seems a lot of rich men have suddenly died on Russell and Alex knows why. She is what is called a Black Widow, a woman who mates and then kills. No one has found any evidence to prove it, however, and Alex's attempt to catch her at it becomes murky as a seduction begins to take place.<br /><br />The locations and the stars are beautiful and as Winger and Russell circle each other in this game with deadly stakes you can't take your eyes off them. Winger's Alex is smart and determined, but vulnerable, and Russell gives a flawless and sexy performance as a smart and icy beauty with a heart full of venom.<br /><br />The electricity between the two characters jumps off the screen. The pool scene where they first meet gives us an indication of what is to come as Alex attempts to get close to Russell, with some unexpected twists. The formost of these is a scene when Alex gives Russell a Black Widow pendant, a spider who mates and kills its lover. Russell's response plays with the fragile but determined Alex as she begins to doubt herself.<br /><br />You don't want to miss this one. It's gorgeous to look at and has two riveting performances from Winger and Russell. You can't find a better one than this.this.
0380713802|4.0|`Neither here nor there' is Bill Bryson's travel accounts through Europe, mostly some large cities. Now Bryson really isn't a traveller, he's more of an observing tourist. Typically, Bryson arrives somewhere, checks into a hotel, has something to say about it, goes out for a hike, wondering about what he sees, comparing it with how it looked twenty years ago when shoestringing the place with his side kick Katz, goes into a restaurant and either mocks or glorifies it. As always, food and beverages are quite a big deal in Bryson's accounts. And as ever, when being bored of it, he just skips some parts. He seems quite easy in strolling the local Main Street and then happily scratching the city of his list as a done deal.  <br /> <br />Now that all sounds quite shallow if it wasn't for Bryson's observing eye and him taking a keen and clever interest in everything he sees, being accurate while at it. Plus he's hugely witty and funny, he really is. Even when he's p.o. about something, he's always amusing. Besides, more then his feet, his mind wanders in all directions at times, placing things into amusing perspectives. One really shouldn't judge this as a travel book, you just want to enjoy it for it's Bill Bryson who wrote it.
B00005UW9T|5.0|This warm and romantic film from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has long been my favorite animated feature. This mostly fictional story of Russia's famous Anastasia and her search for her family is sprinkled with humor and great songs. The animation, from snowy Russia to glamorous Paris, is top notch and the story is both heartwarming and fun.<br /><br />A great cast of voices, including Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Cusack (Dimitri), Kelsey Grammer (Vladimir), Christopher Lloyd (Rasputin) and Angela Lansbury as Anastasia's beloved grandmother add depth to an enchanting film. Anastasia wants to leave Russia for Paris because the necklace she wears has the inscription, \\"Together in Paris,\\" which she is sure holds the key to her journey to discover who she is and where she belongs.<br /><br />Dimitri and Vladimir plan to pass her off as the real Anastasia for the reward in exchange for her visa out of Russia. The banter between Anastasia and Dimitri masks a growing attraction, of course, and when Dimitri discovers before she does that she really is Anastasia he knows he must step aside.<br /><br />Complicating matters is the evil Rasputin, who has placed a curse on her family and sold his soul to destroy them. His little fruit bat Bratok (Hank Azaria) is a very funny creation and turns out to be not so evil at all.<br /><br />The story is peppered throughout with great songs, including \\"Journey to the Past\\" and the haunting \\"Once Upon a December.\\" Anastasia is warm and involving, separating it from other animated films. When Anya discovers she really is Anastasia, it is bittersweet, as she now must choose between her past and her future. Love may conquer all, but not if the evil Rasputin has his way.<br /><br />This is a heartfelt and funny animated feature you'll want to own and watch over and over. Don't miss this one.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Christian bale is a very underated actor, I am actually glad to see him getting more respect and recognition at the box office lately. unfortunately, American Psycho i thought was very overlooked. The setting takes place in the mid 80's during the yuppie pop culture. Christian Bale is a typical Wall St. business man, picky, sharp, and sick. Christian Bale (Patrick Bateman) is a quite the perfectonist, his whole day is completley sheduled. From his fememine face masks to his daily workout not too mention his awesome taste in women, he is a mans man in my book. Bateman is pretty slick at first, but soon his unexplained urges to kill catch up to him. I won't ruin the ending but the whole setting is pretty cool, thats if you like the 80's. As for the dvd, \\"The Uncut Killer's Collector's edition\\" is the way to go. The transfer is amazing crisp clear, no grain, no darkness, the audio is enhanced to a 5.1 sound mix which is very nice. My speakers get alot of attention. The special features are interesting too, good solid interviews on the setting of the film to the book. Deff. worth the upgrade if you have a previous release....
0788815490|5.0|Rarely has a film of such extraordinary visual beauty reached the profound emotional depths of this magnificently acted period film from Iain Softley. Based on the novel by Henry James, cinematographer Eduardo Serra sets a table of beauty and elegance while screenwriter Houssein Amini serves up dishes of love, passion and desire, all arranged in their proper order by director Softley, creating an unforgettable dining experience.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is Kate, a passionate beauty in love with Martin (Linus Roache), a man without money. Charlotte Rampling is her rich aunt, who may force her to marry well, but not for love. Kate has a fire burning beneath her dark beauty, however, and when fate gives her an opportunity to show Martin how she loves, a dangerous journey down winding currents is begun, and neither she nor Martin will be prepared for what awaits them at the river's end.<br /><br />Alison Elliot is simply marvelous as Millie, her finest role since \\"The Spitfire Grill.\\" Millie is a charming American girl of great wealth reaching out to touch life before it passes by. She and Kate will become fast and inseparable friends, but Millie's attraction to Martin and a secret discovered by Kate will set in tenuous motion a plan to solve all their problems. When the maneuvering of lives like chess pieces involves both the human heart and someone as special as Millie, however, unforseen complications can arise.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter may have received all the nominations as the beautiful and passionate Kate, but Alison Elliot's portrayel of the sweet and open Millie, rich but lonely, and desparate for love, deserved an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination as well. Italy is beautifully recreated from the period in a film of both depth and beauty.<br /><br />This film is a true cinematic masterpiece. A gratuitous scene with Carter near the end of this film seems out of place, but can not detract from its beauty. Fine Italian lace is gently lifted back to reveal an emotionally naked look at the human heart. It is substance with beauty and beauty with substance, and is not to be missed.back to reveal an emotionally naked look at the human heart. It is substance with beauty and beauty with substance, and is not to be missed.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|When Anchor Bay announced they were comming out with a Dawn of the Dead \\"ultimate Edition\\" they really meant it. You can see really see the blood sweat and tears that went through this dvd by looking at the cover. This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief. The packaging is amazing as well, you get an actual Dawn of the dead Comic book along with a good solid insert on all 4 discs. Overall one of the best movies and dvd packages of all time from Anchor Bay. A must buy!

0060975768|5.0|I would give this book 10 stars if I could! <br /> <br />I have read this book at least 20 times and I every time I read it I am awed by the sheer power of the words.  Never before have I read a book that moved me to laugh and cry and ache with sadness like this one.  It is not a book about who was right or wrong.  It is a book about the strength of the human spirit to  survive in circumstances so terrible and horrific that people like me can only imagine.  It reminds us of the fact that all of the soldiers (Viet Cong, American, ARVN, Iraqi)  are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers.  Even today Vietnam Veterans receive little respect or appreciation for what they did, which was their job.  I am humbled by the men I met in the pages of this book, not because they were perfect, but because they were thousands of miles from home in a place they didn't know, fighting a war they didn't understand and they did their best every day with no praise or parades or yellow ribbons at home.  If you want to read an account of what war is really like this is the book for you. <br /> <br />Some of the most moving moments in my opinion are: <br />2nd Lt. Geoghan, new father, dies trying to save PFC Willie Godbolt. <br />Captain Tom Metsker shot and killed while helping another injured man onto the huey. <br />PFC Ernie Savage kept his cut off platoon alive for two days with nothing more than a level head and sheer determination. <br /> <br />There are too many moments to write them all down, but each is as gripping as the last.        <br /> <br />I read the review by Capt. Tony Nadal, who fought in the Ia Drang valley with Col. Hal Moore and I feel like I know him.  I would like to say thanks to him and all the men and women who fought, lived, died and were forever changed by that war.  Though those words hardly seem adequate.
0743454537|5.0|This novel is amazing. I picked it up and couldn't put it down. It tells the story of Anna and her sister Kate who was diagnosed with leukemia when she was 3. Anna was born to save her sister. Anna and Kate spend their lives in the hospital...except one sister is healthy and the other is dying. This story is told through the point of views of Anna, and her dad, mom, brother, lawyer and guardian ad litem. I love reading through other people's point of views, not just the main character. Because you want to be on Anna's side, but when you read her mother's point of view, you start agreeing with her. It's amazing. Jodi Picoult an awesome job. And don't read the end first. Because it's a surprise ending!
B0009AM5JA|2.0|It's so sad that such good music can sound so horrible. Such a waste of talent put on a copy guarded disc. I will never in my life buy another copy guarded disc. Too bad for the artists when their music is so inspirational and they sound like crap.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|I got this album at the same time as the latest Gorillaz album, and , while it does offer a few promising tracks, this album just doesn't feel as catchy, infectious, and warm as the Gorillaz album. Of course I realize that they are different music types, but the point is that this music is so cold, repetitive, and sterile that it doesn't warrant repeated listening just for those 2 or 3 decent songs, whereas the Gorillaz album has earned a higher percentage of my rotation by showing more variety and depth.     A few of these tracks are barely discernable from eachother because of the similarities in melody and beats. Almost every single song goes on for far too long considering the repetitiveness of each track [at least in my opinion]. This album feels a lot like some of Kraftwerk's old stuff translated onto modern instruments, but obviously it does not feel as fresh and original as it did a few decades ago. My advice: You'd be better served just buying the tracks 'Human after all' and 'Technologic' and getting your remaining electronica fix elsewhere.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This has to be Lamb of Gods best in the long run. The power in songs like \\"One Gun\\" and \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" to the oldschool Slayer sound in \\"Faded Line\\" really comes together perfect in this one of a kind album.  I personally think the guitars could have been mixed better, alittle too weak but nothing too severe to change the rating. The guitar work itself is nothing less than perfect with powerfull vocals along the way. This album deserves the five stars and definately deserves a listen.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This latest Batman installment out of the past 4 is simply one of the best ones and in my book ties with the original from 1989.  I don't see how any batman fan could not like this?  It has everything in it, action, suspense, romance, etc, which alot of other previous ones either lacked or overloaded on. This one really balances all out and doesn't overkill on any one element. I really recommend this to everyone. Tim Burton's version of Batman is memorable and distinctive, but director Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman has put a whole new spin on our flying dark avenging caped cruasder. All in all, a must see!
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|How does 1 misery-inducing, dull featurette, a trailer, and a music video that we've all seen a zillion times already qualify this as having \\"special edition\\" splashed all over it? Too many suckers fall for this kind of thing, when they see a special edition of their favourite movies, only to be disappointed. I'm disappointed, cos I couldn't even sit through the whole featurette, but I bought mine on the cheap. So it's not that big a loss. And lets face it, Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" spent about 14 weeks (correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm just guessing) at the top of the UK charts, and I'm sick of seeing the video now. 13 years after the film was originally released would have warranted some decent extras. I suppose we'll have to wait until the 25th anniversary of this film to see if we get any decent DVD release - which so didn't happen with Grease, it's well past it's 25th anniversary, and still no special edition.<br /><br />Back to the film. I love this movie! The only thing that's stopping it from getting four stars is the dismal DVD release. It's so nice to see Whitney Houston the way she was, rather than the way she is now - talk about fame going to your head. She's never had a big a hit as she did with the aforementioned song, and that's been her downfall. The soundtrack album to this movie became one of the largest-selling soundtrack albums in history. To date, it has sold over 17 million copies. Sales were fueled by the success of the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" which was written by Dolly Parton. According to Soundscan, the top-selling soundtrack was \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" album with 22 million albums sold to date.<br /><br />It's also my favourite Kevin Costner movie so far, as he's absolutely terrific in this. And for once, there's actually some chemistry between the two lead stars, which always helps towards a \\"romantic comedy\\".<br /><br />I would only recommend getting this so-called special edition DVD for very, very cheap. It's not worth the hassle of buying it full price just to be disappointed.t's not worth the hassle of buying it full price just to be disappointed.
B0009H1CKG|5.0|this dvd oozes funk like a skunk.  very very cool, audio and picture are great, not to mention the performance itself! A stand out for me was Kendra Foster, that girl has a gorgeous voice.
0790729970|3.0|Oh well, almost. But in some scenes, there are definitely some very slight similarities. I haven't seen this movie in a couple of years now, but recently got it on DVD, but was quite disappointed, that I don't find it as good anymore. I prefer him in Liar Liar to this now. The movie's still very good, but over the years, your opinions do change of movies unfortunately.<br /><br />Jim Carrey's ability to imitate voices, and do the craziest faces really came to the forefront in this movie, and it's become more OTT in later movies. However, he's not the only great actor in this - Peter Greene is just excellent, and a very young, very voluptuous Cameron Diaz appears. I bet a few men will remembering fancying her when this first came out! (She's too skinny now)<br /><br />This movie gives a big nod to the Looney Tunes movies, with Stanley watching the cartoons, and a Tazmanian Devil cushion on his couch. His alter ego, The Mask, acts like various cartoon characters, most notably the Tazmanian Devil (traveling as a tornado), Pepe Le Pew (romancing Tina in the park), Bugs Bunny (dying in the gangster's arms), and Tex Avery's Wolf (seeing Tina in the nightclub). I think any girl would love a reaction like that.<br /><br />Before anyone thinks that Cameron Diaz can really sing, she can't! I can't say anything about A Life Less Ordinary (where she also sings with the god-awful Ewan), but her singing voice in this was dubbed by Susan Boyd.<br /><br />I love the part where Jim Carrey actually managed to improvise something, which stayed in the movie. You can imagine he's getting better at doing this in movies now. Shows how much of a little innocent I am, considering I totally didn't get the bit where he pulls out the wet condom from his pocket and says \\"Sorry wrong pocket\\".<br /><br />There's not many extras on the DVD edition I have (region 2), but I'm not really that interested. However, there are versions (haven't bothered to watch the extras on my version) that contain two deleted scenes. One was an introduction with the Vikings coming to bury the Mask on the shore, while another was in the warehouse after Peggy turns Stanley over to Dorian; he picks her up and throws her into the printing press, with a newspaper printing out that shows her smashed face and says she died that night.<br /><br />I haven't really seen Peter Greene in much, although I can imagine he gets typecast as the villan a lot of the time. It's just the way he looks isn't it?<br /><br />There are some cracking one-liners in this, as there are in most Jim Carrey movies. Some of my favourites include:<br /><br />\\"Hold on, Sugar! Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight!\\"<br /><br />\\"Our love is like a red, red rose... and I am a little thorny.\\"<br /><br />\\"Okay, Twinkle Toes. I want to know where my money is, and I want to know right now.\\" (I think only Peter Greene could get away with calling someone Twinkle Toes)<br /><br />\\"Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal my croissant. I will spread your pate. I will dip my ladle in your vichyssoise.\\"<br /><br />\\"Look Ma, I'm roadkill!\\"<br /><br />\\"You gotta ask yourself one question. \\"Do I feel lucky?\\" Well do ya? Punks!\\"<br /><br />\\"Je t'adore. Je t'window. I don't care!\\"<br /><br />This is definitely a movie to have in your collection, I just don't find it as funny as I used to.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I read all the hype on the series after it was cancelled, but missed the original broadcast. We took a chance and ordered the series out of curiousity, and were SOOO glad we did.  My family are all \\"Stargate SG1\\" devotees, and thought NO series could beat it.  We were wrong.  Firelfy has action, adventure, humor, silliness, drama and touchingly romantic tension that a lot of series try for, but miss badly. Firefly has everything that would keep an audience glued to the TV for hours.  Fox's shortsighted treatment of the show was a crime.  We look forward to the feature film and hopefully a more forward-thinking network will realize there is a big audience out there just waiting for more stories.  We really care about these characters and want to know what happens next!!!!  (Scifi Channel, are you listening???)
0975991477|5.0|As a physician I have devoted my time and energies guided by my scientific and spiritual appetites toward research in new discoveries affecting planetary consciousness. There are myriads of articles addressing mind and body medicine and postulates bordering on seemingly impossible assumptions. Our approaches to new ideas are subject to our own prejudices, therefore assumptions about new concepts, especially if they challenge our sources of \\"Bread and Butter\\", may overshadow the obvious. \\"Don't kill the messenger\\"! Dr. Lipton is well educated and passionate about his discoveries and delivers his findings with great passion endorsed by sound scientific research. <br />In my clinical applications of Dr. Lipton's recommended technique \\"Psych-K\\" I have found astounding success. The small investment in time and money through the use of this process has yielded miraculous results. My conclusion is that the more we rely on the extrinsic the less we accept our intrinsic gifts and surrender to a mediocre existence. The question is \\"Are we here to experience the Human Condition or are we here to Condition the Human Experience\\"? I strongly urge those who have \\"surrendered\\" to an allopathic model that has evidently failed to encourage or educate patients about their part in the healing process to venture inside and rediscover the powerful and divine beings that we are! Can science accept the miracles of Jesus and other magnificent teachers and still remain objective? Remember, scientists, doctors and others in the healing fields are also subject to the same pressures and fears that drive this society. I urge you to use compassion and discernment in your choices for help and realize we are all growing at our own paces.
B00000DOYR|5.0|A true milestone in music, 'Back In Black' is undoubtfully one of the most influential rock albums of all time.  With hits such as &quot;Back in Black&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; it would be impossible to regret the purchase of such classic material.  Following the untimely death of singer Bon Scott, AC/DC decided to introduce to the world the sound and soul of Brian Johnson.  While a staggering number of bands have failed to find success after replacing their lead singer, AC/DC only grew to find success as one of the most well respected rock bands of all time.  I can assure you that disapointment will not be found in this album.  For those about to rock...I salute you!

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Mariah Carey songs. They are some of the best of her career. The collection features the fabulous new singles It's Like That and We Belong Together, aswell as other brilliant songs! If you are a Mariah fan, I think you should buy this album and it should not be missed as it's such a great effort! <br /> <br />As I said above, all of the tracks are sensational, and Mariah's vocal range is just outstanding. Songs like We Belong Together (check out the long note at the end of the song), Mine Again, Circles and Fly Like A Bird (nice choir arrangement) really show what a brilliant singer Mariah is, but all of the songs are excellent! <br /> <br />If anything, this is the best comeback of the year 2005 so far. Mariah is back, and it looks great! This is one of Mariah's greatest efforts to date, featuring mind-blowing songs. The UK Edition features a bonus track Sprung, and it's another excellent song which you should check out! After her rather damning-critisized album Charmbracelet, Mariah returns with The Emancipation Of Mimi, and what a success it has been so far and what an excellent album it is! To buy!

B00000F1D3|5.0|I like this album! I think that it should have been an even bigger hit than it was. When Cher released the first single from the album, Believe, she was popular again. Believe is not Cher's best album, there are quite a few that top it, however, it's still fabulous and deserves its merits! <br /> <br />Believe boasts of 9 new numbers, and 1 remix. The album features the brilliant hits Believe, Strong Enough, All Or Nothing and Dov L'amore. My favourite single from the album is Strong Enough. This is one of the best Cher songs ever and definately one of the best from this album! All 4 singles are sensational.  <br /> <br />The album tracks must not be missed either! Runaway, Taxi Taxi and Love Is The Groove are all excellent dance tracks, Taking Back My Heart lets off an R'n'B groove, while The Power is another strong song. The other track is a remix of We All Sleep Alone. I thought that this remix was OK, but not as good as the original version or the other tracks on the album.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is an incredible album! Every Cher fan should have it, and if you don't have it, then I strongly reccommend you pick it up NOW!! These tracks are sensational! I play this album all the time and it's one of the best I own. Pick it up!!

B000083E79|5.0|I am a massive Cher fan, so when this came out I rushed out to the shops to buy it! I am not from the US, I am from the UK. However, I have the US edition aswell as the UK. This is a wonderful collection of fabulous hits, they are timeless and Cher will always be timeless. She is just one of the greatest diva's around, along with artists like Mariah Carey. <br /> <br />This collection boasts of 21 stunning hits, most of them being hits in the UK and the US. Some of the biggest hits are Believe, If I Could Turn Back Time, One By One (the version on here is remixed), The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss), Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down), Gyspies, Tramps And Thieves, Dark Lady and I Got You Babe.  <br /> <br />Most songs here appear in their original forms, though three tracks are remixed. The remixes include One By One (remixed by the extremely talented Junior Vasquez), A Different Kind Of Love Song (remixed by Rodney Jerkins) and the collection features the 1987 version of Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down). I did not mind the One By One remix, it was just as good as the album version. The 1987 version of Bang Bang is loads better than the original version. It's more powerful, a stronger song, and Cher's vocals sound better than ever. I think they should've included the original version of A Different Kind Of Love Song.  <br /> <br />So overall this collection is brilliant. Every Cher fan should own it, and it is essential to any fan of her hits or whoever may want something entertaining to listen to. I love all of the tracks, and will play them over and over again. Long live Cher!

B000002KET|4.0|I bought this album on a whim in 1999 because it happened to be on sale at the music store where I was trying to sell Metallica's Reload.  Well, they wouldn't let me sell it, but it's actually a good thing I tried because I picked up this gem. <br /> <br />I'd heard of Black Sabbath and knew they were a major impact on Metallica and other bands, but had no idea they were the metal pioneers (some argue it's Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin, but listen to what they played in 1970 and then listen to Black Sabbath's debut). <br /> <br />I was in for a treat.  This album is still my second favorite of Sabbath's work, and Sabbath is still my third favorite band.  So why am I not giving this album five stars? <br /> <br />The problem with Sabbath is that because metal was new, they were extremely experimental.  This means that while they released some great songs, they released some poor ones as well.  This album is no exception. <br /> <br />\\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", \\"A National Acrobat\\", \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\", \\"Looking For Today\\", \\"Spiral Architect\\", and even the slow instrumental \\"Fluff\\" are all good to great tracks.  \\"Who Are You?\\" on the other hand is simply Sabbath playing around with a synth.  This song lets the album down, which is why I can only give it four stars.
0975991477|5.0|I am a physician who turns 65 this week.  My career was and is punctuated by the harassment one receives when one is challenging medical dogma. When I began doing outpatient surgery, I was called before the Executive Committee of my hospital to explain the \\"circus\\" I was involving myself in.  When I began to put intraocualar lenses in eyes after cataract surgery, I was fired from my position as Chief of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery because \\"Anyone so stupid as to put lenses in eyes has no business teaching residents\\".  When I did the research for the laser used in Lasik, I was told it was unbelievable that anyone could be so stupid as to make incisions across the visual axis of a good eye.  Now it is almost malpractice not to do those things!!!!How time changes things. <br /> <br />There are those who are constantly willing to re-examine what they think they know.  There are others who cannot deal with the idea that what they were taught might be wrong.  One can clearly see that in the reviews above. <br /> <br />Dr. Lipton has clearly challenged what we thought we knew and opened Pandora's box.  Scientists have long stated, \\"If you can't prove it, it doesn't exist.\\"  That means that we relegate our belief system to the quality of our measuring devices.  Since we couldn't measure things at biological speeds until we got Pentium class computers, we haven't been able to measure biological electronic function for very many years.  Lipton has helped refocus us away from the false belief that the body is Newtonian and reductionistic to the reality that the body works at the atomic level where Newton's laws fail and electromagnetic energy rules. <br /> <br />Buy this book---it will change your life if you will measure it against what is real instead of what you were taught.
B000002KB8|4.0|This album opens with the scariest guitar riff Ozzy ever heard in his life and one of the coolest I've ever heard in mine.  This is where metal started, when Sabbath was a blues band called Earth and Iommi came up with that bone crunching riff. <br /> <br />You will not find a bad track on this album.  \\"Black Sabbath\\" is a classic, \\"The Wizard\\" showcases Ozzy's command of the harmonica, \\"A Bit of Finger/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.\\" is an amazing meddly of some of Sabbath's more memorable songs, \\"Wicked World\\" is great, and the last track buries an amazing cover in a slaughterhouse of awesome riffs.  What more could you want in an album? <br /> <br />The final track, however, does get a bit much sometimes...and the album is short (I know, it's a debut, but...).  All the songs are great though, so pick it up.
0140143505|5.0|Wow. The exquisite relationship between the author and a bookseller in England and how it transforms both of their lives, and the lives of those around them is a testament to humanity. The meticulous and slowly crafted relationship that formed over several years through letters and packages,is nothing short of beautiful. On top of that, it is a joy to read. Funny, touching, and in weird way kind made me feel kind of snoopish for reading their letters. But I loved it. So much said in so few words, especially at the start of their correspondance. After reading this book, I ordered every Helene Hanff book and devoured them (with the exception of her children's books). She's just the kind of person you hope to be like, or you hope to have as a friend.<br />A great book for book lovers, anglophiles, New York lovers . . .and anyone looking for a very quick and charming read.
0316168815|4.0|I read this book within a 24 hour timespan. I have two children under the age of 2, otherwise I would have finsihed it sooner. <br /> <br />I was completely hooked on this book. The main theme of this book is family. In my family, like many others, a child died, a brother that I never knew. This death was like a shadow that was constantly at my feet. I know my other siblings felt it too. I have great admiration for anyone that has ever lost a child, for their ability to try to go on living. I do not know how I would go on if that were to happen to me. Again, like many marriages do, my parents divorcedm I believe in part because my brothers death. <br /> <br />I just found this book so relatible also because of the characters, especially her school friends. I felt like I was in that high school. <br /> <br />It was a nice break for me to able to read again and enjoy it. I do not get much time for it. I am going to try to make time. <br /> <br />I would like my next book to be a little lighter. The lovely bones lingers with you. <br /> <br />As soon as I finshed it I gave my husband and big hug and kissed him. If anything, this book will make you think about all of the horrible things that can happen outside the doors of your home and make you hold on to your family a little tighter. <br />
B00003CX5P|5.0|In league with the Dark Lords of the Sith, the Trade Federation blockades the peaceful planet called Naboo. The leader of the Republic, the Supreme Chancellor, sends two Jedi Knights it investigate the matter.  Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi.    Queen Amidala, recently elected to the thrown, is convinced to leave her people to inform the senate.  The badly damaged freighter stops on Tatooine for much needed repairs.  Qui-Gon Jinn and Padm Naberrie, the Queen's handmaiden, encounters a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker.  This boy, although too old for Yoda's class of young lings, is strong with the force.  It is believed that he's the chosen one that'll bring balance to the force.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane has definitely made a five star album. The piano- driven songs are amazing and I cannot get enough of them. I love the piano on here but also I love the vocals and the beat in the background. It all seems to blend together in every song and I find myself just being swept away. At first I thought this was a four- star album, but today I just kept repeating songs over and over and I love all of the songs, not one do I hate or think is just all right. Their music is as I say, beautiful and addictive. Some of the songs are more powerful than the others though, but all are great to listen to. I bought this album on mere whim, which is a habit I have once and awhile, and I never truly am wrong and my hunch on Keane wasn't wrong either. I could not get enough of Somewhere when it came out, and now Everybody's Changing was haunting me terribly, especially with the gorgeous piano in it. I love this album, it's one of my favs of this year and I highly recommend it!  <br />The best songs on here are Somwhere, Bend and Break, We Might As Well,  Everbody's Changing (I consider this the best song on here), Your Eyes Open, She Has No Time, Sunshine (beautiful!), Untitled will take you away, and Bedshaped is amazing. All the songs are great though, check this band out. They'll leave you breathless trust me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Suprisingly I just got into Coldplay last year and became immediately in love with both of their first cds. After catching up I heard about their new cd coming out and only hoped that it would be as good as their first ones. Well they did it again- they've come out with and amazing cd--going 2 c them in concert in august!!
B000002UB3|5.0|It's difficult to circumscribe the brilliance of this album. Though I wasn't born until almost 20 years after it was released, when I picked up my parents' record for the first time all the songs were very familiar to me, and my parents DIDNT ever play records. So that gives you some idea as to how memorable all these songs are, and how widely recognised. <br /> <br />Aside from the cover, which is probably (besides Sgt Peppers') the most famous album cover ever, it is not worth attempting an in depth review of all the songs, since many others have already done that. It is worth noting how much I love the more 'silly' songs like Maxwell's Silver Hammer. It's amazing how many people I speak to who don't care for this song. There's something in its lightheartedness that can cheer anybody up in any situation, sure it's 'silly', but that doesn't stop it from having a wonderful melody. And what's wrong with a song being 'fun' anyway? <br /> <br />The rest of the songs on the first side (come together, etc) need no real explaining; all are exceptional. The second side also needs no detailed review; but the TONE of the guitars is perhaps the most attractive thing about this side. They all sound very....well 'warm' is the best way to put it. It reminds me of watching a sunrise/sunset. Sounds corny but there it is. <br /> <br />I can't say if it's the 'best' beatles album by any means. You can't define 'best' where this band is concerned; once you attempt to classify one album as the 'best' you instantly think 'but then again, Sgt Peppers.....or the White Album... or Revolver' etc ad infinitum. It is better simply to say that Abbey Road is an incredible album, as we'd expect from the greatest band ever.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The butterfly effect was a intense movie that shows how every action has a reaction. Ashton Kutchers chacater has an inherrited disease from his father that he blacks out trauma. He keeps journals to keep track of his black outs. He realizes when he is in college that he might be able to go back and change the way things are. Moment by moment this movie was fast paced and intense. Great acting on and great soundtrack. Butterfly not only is entertaining but it makes you think. I recommend this movie highly.
B000002U82|5.0|This will be a short review; many of my esteemed colleagues have looked at the specific songs on this album in more detail, so its unnecessary to repeat them <br /> <br />I will say however, that nobody should be without this album. Dark Side of the Moon is an epic piece of symphonic history; as another reviewer put it, you don't listen to this album, you experience it. It has a surreal, almost magical effect on people; from the spacey, underwatery Speak to me/Breathe, to the incredible deep and symphonic Eclipse, this album takes you places no other album can. <br /> <br />It should be listened to as an album, rather than a collection of songs. Like the Wall, it is based around a concept (i.e. the 'human experience', birth to death and all things in between). To that end most of the tracks are only good to great in isolation. BUT together they equal an incredible, breathtaking and unsurpassed musical experience. You don't need to be on drugs to enjoy the music of Pink Floyd; Dark Side of the Moon is a drug in itself (as lame as that sounds), and as far as I know you can't get done for being under the influence of Dark Side of the Moon.... <br /> <br />Pay no mind to the reviewers who give this album less than 5 stars; most of them are kids, too immature and brainwashed by all the modern, processed, pop/hip hop S&^%, like 'Justin Timberlake', and 'Usher', to know what real music and composing is like. If you don't like Pink Floyd, that's fine, not that you need to in order to enjoy this album; so many people have it, many of them must be just casual listeners who can still appreciate its brilliance. BUT if you don't like the album (god forbid), then it's tempting to say that you're just 'wrong'. <br /> <br />It may be a matter of opinion overall, but an album like this cannot be surpassed, or circumscribed in words. You have to listen to it, fully, preferably in an intimate environment and let the music flow through you. If you do this, and you still don't like it,then I'm sorry, but you're just WRONG.
0440238609|1.0|I did NOT like this book at all!! There was nothing lower than a \\"1\\", so that's what I gave it. If I wanted to be preached at for most of the series, I would have read the Bible.  Although it did have some SciFi elements, it was overall a religious book. It was also confusing. I STILL don't know what the heck is Dust. Seriously, this book is B.O.R.I.N.G.!! Well, that's my opion anyway.... >_>
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I got into Iron Maiden when I was about 15, that was five years ago, so I was fortunate enough to be getting into a band that was just about to release a masterpiece like Brave New World. As a fan from Australia, I wasn't able to see the band on tour, but I loved the entire Brave New World album and I hoped for great things from the follow up, Dance of Death, though I didn't expect it to be AS good. <br /> <br />My expectations were met; Dance of Death is a great album, but it isn't excellent like Brave New World. It took a little more getting into than Brave New World did, which was an instant classic which you didn't need to 'try' to love. BUT, that said, there is a lot to commend Dance of Death to hardcore Maiden fans, and even non-hardcore ones <br /> <br />For starters there are no 'big' surprises on this album. It's a common citation that Iron Maiden don't very their style a great deal, though the band themself say that this is precisely the point - you always know what you're gonna get with Iron Maiden; quality, epic songs, and this is what Dance of Death provides. <br /> <br />The starting track, Wildest Dreams, is a good opener. IT's a faster rocker, with a good, if not great, chorus. It isn't up to the standard of the 'Wicker Man', but its not hard to enjoy <br /> <br />Rainmaker is an instant classic; you can tell Dave Murray had a hand in the song for the great guitar harmonies (think Deja Vu from Somewhere in Time). And the vocal melody is excellent; Bruce sounds just as good as he did on Brave New World (which is very good) <br /> <br />No More Lies is a song I'm not hugely keen on; it is not a bad song by any means, though it sounds a little like the Clansman (which may or may not be bad...). The verses are fine, and the lyrics are good. The chorus however just doesn't do it for me; I think its too repetitive and monotone; screaming 'no more lies' multiple times doesn't appeal to me. But it isn't a bad song, just one I would tend to skip in favour ofwhat comes next <br /> <br />Montsegur is an incredible track, one of the best from maiden in years. It seems to have been written (i've done some research) about a catholic massacre of some people called the Cathars, who lived in a monastery or something atop a mountain in the Pyrenees I think, called 'Mont segur (safe mountain)'. It's a song full of feeling and energy; the chorus is particularly interesting, Bruce sounds so cynical as he sings 'we kill them all so god will know his own, the innocents died for the pope on his throne'. The guitar melodies in the second half of the song, and the solos, are also great. It's perhaps the best song Janick Gers has had a hand in <br /> <br />The title track is also good; it took a little getting into for me, but now I love it, particularly the harmonised guitars. Bruce's singing is again excellent <br /> <br />Gates of Tomorrow is a song I don't really care for. IT's by no means a bad song, but it just never reached out to me in the way songs like 'Montsegur' or 'Rainmaker' did, the intro is good (reminds me of Lord of the Flies), but the songs never goes anywhere. The chorus is nothing special or memorable <br /> <br />New Frontier is a great track, Nicko's first composition and it only took him 23 years with the band! It's a faster rock song <br /> <br />Paschendale comes next; it's a wonderful song. I heard lots of hype before the album was released about the quality of this song, and I must confess it wasn't as monumental as I was led to believe. Yet it is still fantastic; I was just expecting another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. There is a lot of feeling in this song, singing about the horrors of war, and the guitar (presumably Adrian Smith) plays a very interesting riff at the beginning which reminds one of wasted years. Iron Maiden have written a number of anti-war songs in their career, but Pascendale is easily superior to others like the Aftermath or Fortunes of War <br /> <br />Face in the Sand starts a little like Blood Brothers, not necessarily a bad thing. It is a pity the clean intro doesn't last longer, since it is pleasing to the ear. THe rest of the song is also good, Bruce sounds very good, though I hear him straining a little in the verses. <br /> <br />Age of Innocence is often dubbed 'filler' in these reviews, and maybe it is, but it isn't a bad song; I prefer it to Gates of Tomorrow any day. The chorus is the high point of the song, the melody is easy to like. The verses aren't as good however. <br /> <br />Journeyman is the final track; I believe its the first and only totally acoustic song that Iron Maiden have ever done? (maybe Prodigal son or Strange World could be argued, though the latter at least has some distorted guitar solos). It's a great track, with nice orchestral harmonies and heartfelt singing. If you know bruce's solo work, it reminds me a little of Arc of Space, but it isn't quite as good. <br /> <br />OVERALL then, this is a strong album well worth a listen and certainly not deserving of any less than four stars. There is a lot to like about it; sure it isn't as good as Brave New World, but you can't expect a band to achieve that quality consistently. Be realistic and expect a good, solid album with some excellent and some decent songs, and you won't be disappointed.  My expectation is that the next album will be even better.
B00005JMAH|5.0|First, this is a very, very beautiful film. Had it got no relation with the book, it would still remain a very beautiful film at least on visual level (and not only).  <br />The film might seem to many not strongly enough related to the book. For this I have found a very useful solution: I simply view the book and the film as two separate pieces of art. Because if you view(ed) the film as \\"the definite realisation\\" of the book this would mean that there's no more room for your imagination. That the book is actually that film and nothing more. So, read the book and imagine and don't expect to see the exact materialisation of what you imagined here. <br />If you've read it, you might be disappointed. <br />If you haven't read it, despite some unclear plot strands, you should be satisfied. ( May be they will clear the strands for you in the next movie, I don't know.)  <br />The film's principal merit is that it creates a wonderful atmosphere. Rainy, murky, mediaeval in modern time. <br /> Well, enough have I burdened you with theory. The only thing that slightly annoyed me was the dementors were too tattered. But I got used to it. They have tried to show us a new side of Daniel Radcliffe ( he took me the most time to get used to). They've made him sit on a rock in the snow and cry after he discovers Sirius is actually his Godfather. He really didn't handle the scene. But probably I should follow more strictly my own advice and not view him as \\"what definitely is not the Harry Potter I imagine(d)\\". But as I already said, I'm used to him by now. Hogwarts Castle has undergone some development, the Whomping Willow has been moved to a new place, as has Hagrid's Cabin. The Ron - Hermione attraction, of course not as subtly as in the book, is emphasized on. Buckbeak is magnificent. <br />     All in all, this is the best of the Harry Potter movies to date (although I wouldn't discard the other two), looks very believable, leaves you dreamy and in a good mood after watching it, and can be watched again and again and again.  <br />     -Oh, and John Williams has composed an inseparable part of the film with some wonderful new themes. <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|What can be said about the Wall that can do this masterpiece justice? It is arguably the last classic Pink Floyd album that we were blessed with (The Final Cut is fairly average) and the boys certainly saved the best till last <br /> <br />There is no need for me to detail the progression of the album and the story it tells through the songs; many reviewers before me have done wonderful synopses of the 'concept' behind this album. Instead I will simply say what makes it so wonderful <br /> <br />The Wall should be approached as it pertains to be; a conceptual work that tells a story. I think what touches people so much about the Wall is its application to all our lives. Sure, we aren't all rockstars whose fathers died in the war and whose mothers were overprotective etc, BUT the Wall means so much more than that <br /> <br />The inner struggle and despair that this album chronicles can apply to all of us; the dichotomy between the outward manifestation of a person, and his inner thoughts and feelings. How many of us have felt the need to be strong and outwardly stable, when everything on a personal level was weak and flimsy? How many of us have got to a point in our lives when we can look at ourselves and say 'do I really like what I have become?', and then despair of the things we cannot change? <br /> <br />The Wall can apply to all of those things; it's really a question of what each person can read into it in their own way. THIS is part of the masterpiece that is The Wall <br /> <br />Common criticisms of this album focus on the sometimes weak nature of many of the individual tracks. This is difficult to counter itself, since many of the tracks are short, connecting pieces, designed to facilitate the transition from one subject to another. Examples are songs such as 'The Happiest days of our lives', and 'empty spaces', but many of these are not 'bad' songs. They aren't designed to be exceptional, complex or with great hook lines. They're really transitional pieces, weak on their own, but necessary to enable the story to progress <br /> <br />The Wall isn't really an album of songs, like most albums are. They aren't designed to be taken purely on their own, or at face value. Some songs may seem musically limited, or even weak on their own ('stop' comes to mind), but the purpose of The Wall was not to give an album of stand alone songs, but to convey a story of isolation and alienation. To that end, it is a VERY successful album, and a monumental achievement in rock history. PRobably the greatest concept album ever. <br /> <br />That being said, there is the odd song that is musically unattractive. 'Don't leave me now' springs to mind; it is perhaps painful to listen to at times; Roger Waters' wails, though heartfelt, can be excruciating to the unprepared. I remember listening to The Wall in a friend's car, and when that song came on his brother, who had not minded the other songs, yelled numerous expletives and changed the track. This may be indicative of Roger Waters' singing at times; painful. BUT this is not necessarily a bad thing; while he does not have a pretty voice, unlike David Gilmour whose voice is very sweet and melodic, Roger has an emotion and feeling that is hard to emulate. Such songs are designed to convey the despair etc felt by the main character in the story of the Wall. To that end, songs like 'Dont leave me now' do achieve their objective; just don't show them to anybody you're trying to get to buy the album in isolation. <br /> <br />While the album should definitely be taken as a whole, there is the odd song that works well in isolation. Comfortably numb, Hey You, ANother Brick in the WAll pt 2, Run Like Hell and Mother are perhaps the most obvious. These are great tracks that showcase musical genius. Alongside other, perhaps musically weaker tracks that perform an important role in filling out the story and conveying the emotion of it, they make the Wall an excellent album that is worthy of its position as (I think third) best selling album ever <br /> <br />BUY IT
B0006L16N8|1.0|I would like to take the opportunity to apologize to all of humanity for allowing this album to come to fruition.  I have hitherto maintained a policy of non-intervention in the sphere of popular music, while tending to more pressing concerns (AIDS, famine, nuclear war, Lindsay Lohan), but this time Coldplay has gone too far.  I hereby sentence Chris Martin's first born child to have a stupid, stupid name.  It is decreed! <br /> <br />That said, I have a well-deserved reputation for helping those who help themselves.  A few points to remember, my children: <br /> <br />1)  You shouldn't even need to listen to this to know it sucks.  Haven't you heard any of their previous music in those Nissan commercials?  Haven't your eyes caught a passing glimpse of these paunchy dorks on an NME cover at the supermarket?  Eons of work on the central nervous system and this is the thanks I get. <br /> <br />2) Stop arguing over whether this band is as \\"good\\" as U2 or not.  U2's powder-puff, cliched, sappy drivel is the model for this crap in the first place.  We learned it by watching you, Dad. <br /> <br />3) Don't you have anything better to do than read album reviews on the internet, for Christ's sake?

0312323859|5.0|Emily Giffin has done it again.  In Something Blue, the sequel to her first book, Something Borrowed, Emily manages to humanize a seemingly unlikeable character- Darcy- and create a resolution for the characters that is actually realistic as opposed to being too perfect as if often the case with chick lit.  As with Something Borrowed, I read the book in one sitting as I could not stand to put it down.  I anxiously await Ms. Giffin's third novel (and many more thereafter).
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I can't believe this band is not taking over the world. They are better than ANYTHING that Radiohead ever did, so stop with the comparisons. This three-piece band writes haunting, beautiful, rocking and catchy songs. Buy this CD!
B0000025P9|5.0|Toto IV is one of the best albums ever made!!! This one and Toto's first album are the best ones they made!  Every song on here is catchy except for It's a feeling.  That song isn't quite as good as the rest.  Rosanna is wonderful in every way.  The instruments go well with the fabulous vocals of the guys in toto.  \\"We Made it\\" shows just how wonderful Bobby Kimball's voice is! He definately has one of the greatest voices of all time!  You will feel like you have gone to heaven when you listen to his voice!  Buy this album if you like 80s pop/rock! This is a chance of a lifetime that you can't pass up!!
B00080ZG10|2.0|I can't understand this constant need on the part of Hollywood to obsess over its own past.  It seems Leonardo Di Caprio has allocated a role for himself in this. This film is excessive and boring. The drama is predicatable and really undermines the process of depicting the mental illness of the man.  But most importantly De Caprio, who seems along with Martin Scorsese to be replaying the iconic Americana number these days, is just a pretty face.  The lad is a moron and cannot act.  There is no reason for him to have a career except for his popular appeal. Didn't he say in an interview with Charlie Rose recently that Cinema was the great art form of this age?(which is just a stupid thing to say)  I guess playing Hughes is a testimony to his advocation of this. Both the acting and the interview statements are a kind of consumer confidence ploy (perhaps for each other). Movies like this are the reason intelligent Americans emigrate abroad. This film is pure American onanistic navel gazing. I guess we're left now only with monumentalizing our lunatics, and then by young actors of average intelligence and ability who look good on camera. Actually I guess this is a really good review!! Go and see this film!  Even though I give it only a 2 star, in fact read up on Catherine Hepburn et al. and then go and see this movie... its heroically mediocre.

0975991477|5.0|This book will sit alongside my most valued resources in my collection.  The reasoning is straightforward - conventional medicine is predicated on the Primacy of Matter - that molecules are the basic building blocks of life and the most important.  But conventional health solutions are becoming less effective in the provision of long term health, and more expensive.  Dr. Lipton's work is admirable by focusing on the wider interconnections between the energy of our beliefs, and the amazing behaviour of cells and now epigenetics.    From changing the central biological dogma of the Primacy of DNA, to outlining the quantum nature of information flows and the astounding benefits of conscious parenting, and the failure of the genome project to find enough proteins, this book is packed full of gems sure to benefit everybody.  Lipton addresses energy as purportedly 100 times more powerful than molecules.  It simply makes sense we invest our 'energy' in modelling a health system geared towards both chemical AND energy based solutions - vibrations meeting vibrations.  Dr. Lipton's work asks us to consider the possibility our primary source of energy comes from our internal and external environments, and our unconscious perceptions have a major influence on the health of this exchange.    Obviously contentious, this book is worth 5 stars simply for the pioneering and unique message it brings.    With modern technology we can repeatedly 'perceive' energy in ways we couldn't before.  Science is about improving our technology, and as we are now well and truly in the ascending Dwapara Yuga (Age of Energy) we are being asked to embrace the beginnings of the wisdom and knowledge technology wave.    I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in furthering their study and knowledge of biology beyond what is conventionally proselytised and thought energy or consciousness based healing practices such as energy medicine, homeopathy, reiki, energy psychology or huna had a \\"flaky\\"foundation.  As an adult child of an alcoholic and abuse I know how ineffective drugs are to heal without treatment of beliefs and emotions.  Perceptions very easily select actions from which we make assumptions about people and lifestyle decisions that block energy and create pathology.    In regards to the critical nature of some commentators - Perhaps there is truth to the saying, \\"A prophet is never known in their home town.\\"  I was fortunate to meet Dr Lipton at one of his seminars in Australia and I was blown away by his grasp of biology and the inspirational hope he brings to this knowledge.  Thank you.     This work stands on its own, you don't have to know anything about Psych-K to get real value from it.    Regards,  Daniel John Hancock,  Centre for Wisdom & Knowledge Technology
B000001FMX|5.0|The New York Dolls first disc is a classic.  With a two guitar attack from Johnny Thunders and Sylvain Sylvain, the growling vocals of David Johansen, the bass work of Arthur Kane and the frenatic drumming of Jerry Nolan.  Buddy Bowser provided saxophone and producer Todd Rundgren provided extra piano work.  The songs are great as well Trash, Jet Boy. Vietnamese Baby and Pills to name a few.<br /><br />Their loud guitar crunching sound was somewhat softened by Todd Rundgren's straight forward production.<br /><br />Mercury Records took a chance on the Dolls.  But they gave in after another album due to \\"poor record sales\\".  More likely the band was on a road to self-destruction and they didn't want anything more to due with them.  Forget all that.  Just sit back and relax and listen to the music.  Hey if there were no New York Dolls their would be no Kiss and definetly<br /><br />no Aerosmith (they stole their look and music) and Slash would have to copy off someone else (check out Sylvain Sylvain's outfits from that era).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0393324818|5.0|Since I've work for a pro baseball team in my country i've been involved in the bussines, this book was made with two points of view, one could be baseball fans or anyone else who could reach good reading about sports, they could find a biography which could work as a hollywood script film like Jerry Maguire. Other point of view is that you could find as a complentary reading for a sport bussines course. Anyway whatever be the case this is an excellent book to learn more about this.  <br />Daniel Figueroa  <br />
B000001FS3|5.0|This album is arguably one of the greatest records of all time. I would easily rank it in my top 10 favorites.
B0007P3582|3.0|ok cd, suck a*s lyrics, best songs r candy shop,in my hood, disco inferno, just a lil bit and hate it or love it remix
B0002NRRAG|5.0|B&N was playing this CD ad naseum when it was first released so in between looking through the Bargain books or sipping my coffee, I started to take notice and realized, that no this is not Billie Holliday because it , well, it just isn't, so I went up to the music section and ask \\"who is that playing?\\"  the nice guy behind the counter pulled out a CD with a picture of a gangly looking white girl on the cover, \\" is this the cover or is this the singer?\\" \\"Both, I'm pretty sure, she's the singer.\\"  Thus the beginnig of a deep  appreciation for Ms Peyroux.  And the CD is beautiful to listen to, but what's even better is to see Madeleine live in concert.  I don't  know if it's the acoustics of the Greek Theater, the cool balmy night or simply because she is a beguiling performer.  So understated, so brilliant in her phrasing and marvelous in her interpretation.  She also has a relax attitude towards herself and her audience, she didn't talk much, just sang a lot and once in a while she would make a few sardonic comments that would take her audience by  surprise followed by giggles.  She did put her acoustic guitar a few times, but she looks like she can't do without it.  If by any means or cost, I would encourage you to go and see her in concert, it would be an experience you will treasure and reflect upon.  Not only was she magnificent, her four man band were also exquisite.  And yes, this CD is also fantastic.  You can't help but fall in love with Madeleine Peyroux.  It is the only sensible thing to do.
B00004Z459|4.0|good cd, better than meteora  top 5 in no order  1.papercut  2.one step closer  3.points of authority  4.crawling  5.in the end
B000009ED0|5.0|Ok, if you are looking at this review wondering if you should buy the cd, dont be fooled by all these haters. If this CD was so bad then how did it sell over 10 million copies. But just like all types of music you have to appreciate it to like it. I really enjoyed it and I know lots of other people that have enjoyed it to. If you listened to the sampler and you liked what you heard pick yourself up one of these. Dont be fooled by the people that dont like it, it's just there opinion.
B00008H2LB|4.0|pretty good cd. i mostly listen to rap but i like some rock like limp bizkit and linkin park. my favorite songs are numb and somewhere i belong
B0009PVZWI|5.0|Simply put, another great effort. Disc 1 rocks out and disc 2 is quite mellow, and the contrast between the two are quite unique. You can listen to the samples on here, but if you're a true fan, then you should've already picked up a copy, right? <br /> <br />This album is yet another example of how versatile Grohl really is. Some people don't get it, but most of us who do can understand why. Look at what he's done in the past 3 years alone. Between this double album, QOTSA, Probot, and award winning \\"One by One\\", it's simply amazing. And to be able to tour on top of this? I was fortunate to see them on 3 different occassions (4/03, 6/03, 8/04) and each time was just as enjoyable as the last. <br /> <br />The DVD documentary wasn't anything special and neither were the 5.1 versions of the albums. And that's about all you get with the DualDisc. Thankfully I didn't pay for this, it was shipped to me by mistake (instead of the regular version, hehe) <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and to the whiners about copy protection: SunnComm will actually give you the workaround of their MediaMaxx copy protection via email request. And from what I hear, copy protection only applies to Windows users. No wonder so many people are jumping over to Mac. But, where there's a will...

B00005MAM2|5.0|If you think back long enough, there will be a time when there simply was no animation available in the United States from anywhere else in the world.  Everything that was animation was made in the U.S. (Disney, Hanna Barbara).  There had been a few strange animations that had drifted across the Pacific, one of them being the epic \\"Robotech\\" - a compilation of 3 different animes into one long American show.  Another notable exception was the grand old race car show from Asia called \\"Speed Racer.\\"<br /><br />These shows had a small, small group of fans who thought they were alright, but when it came to a major animated work one usually thought of Walt Disney (for good reason they make amazing films).  Then, in 1988, something new came across the waters, a new and controversial film called AKIRA.  A reworking of a popular comic book in Japan, this film featured a mind bending plot and a new kind of animation that was vastly different from anything anyone had seen before.  Needless to say its cult status exploded upon its limited run in select theaters.  It made much, much more money stateside than was expected and the response was even more unexpected : they wanted more.  Ever since, anime has been a niche category in the States, a new genre brought forth by AKIRA.<br /><br />The film itself is a totally original work, there is absolutely nothing like Akira out there.  It is a political drama, a story about racing friends, a science fiction story, it is all these things.  It is very, very unique.  More than anything, though, it was the vastly different style of the film that made it marketable.  Like any killer app, it filled a niche perfectly and then ignited the market for that product.  People were ready for something different and AKIRA delivers in spades.<br /><br />Disc One:  Akira with full options menu - all dubs / brand new English vocal track with better translation / optional subtitles / THX and Dolby<br /><br />Disc Two: Extras galore.  Interview with the creators (Otomo is a huge fan of 2001 and a Clockwork Orange) / beautiful mechanical artwork made for machines and equipment / a study of the soundtrack / Interview with the new American vocal cast and American producers /with the creators (Otomo is a huge fan of 2001 and a Clockwork Orange) / beautiful mechanical artwork made for machines and equipment / a study of the soundtrack / Interview with the new American vocal cast and American producers /

B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD is great, no reservations. Well maybe I would like to hear some more faster music, but it doesn't really bother me. It's all very cool. Oh and more Irish pennywhistle please!! <br />Who cares if some of the singing doesnt match what you see, everybody knows these things are filmed over lots of concerts and put together - just about every other DVD I have is the same. This music is really fresh and original, I kept waiting for irish dancert to appear but they didn't...hurray!!! <br />Great stuff...any chance of another DVD mine is getting worn out?
0553062182|5.0|This book and this person so thoroughly explained my symptoms over a lifetime that it has changed my life significantly.  I have been able to hand the book to my wife and just say \\"read this\\".  She is totally supportive and now can be creative in helping me think of ideas for coping.  She already bought me the best wrap-around sunglasses I ever had.
B00006AW2J|5.0|When you are forced to listen to \\"Physician Dre and Vanilla M&M\\", there is only one way out. Listen to music back then that didn't suck and didn't contain 25 fillers out 30 songs. This music is great, and is short so you don't have to worry about tracks being wasted on an idiot sighing, playing with wrapping paper, or saying \\"look how I can fill up an album today\\" (Vanila favored M&M). Instead you get songs like the classic \\"Simpathy For The Devil\\" which has a pretty grovy beat complete with maracas, piano, and some wicked guitar licks. You also get \\"Street Fighting Man\\"  , an anthem about the middle class, and \\"Salt Of The Earth\\" which contains a choir in the background and  great piano playing. \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", my personal favorite, shows how bad (and I mean sensually bad,grrrr) this band was for the 60's.  The other songs are mostly pretty relaxing bluegrass songs like \\"No Expectations\\" and \\"Parachute Women\\" that are also catchy but not as rocking.
B0000025HG|5.0|This is one of Barbra's best! You MUST own this album to have a complete collection! One of my all time favorites!
B00081U6EG|4.0|This is a good DVD with some nice surprises for me.  I bought it primarily for Paul Rodgers but of course it didn't hurt to have David Gilmour and Joe Walsh.  I was impressed by the very good guitar work of Hank & Ben Marvin and Phil Manzera each of which were unknown to me.  Gary Moore was unbelievable and most spectacular gutarist on the DVD.  Paul Rodger's versions of Alright Now (w/Brian May) and Can't Get Enough (w/Joe Walsh) were vocally comparable to the performances on Bad Company's Merchants of Cool DVD.  However, while Paul again alowed the audience to sing the entire chorus from both songs these versions were better due to the backup singers joining the audience on the chorus.  As an added bonus for me Paul Rodgers sings the lead on the All Star line-up finale, a nice jam of Stay with Me.
B00006YXWO|5.0|Mariah must have been sent from up above to sing to the world because she really does have the voice of an angel. She has the most beautiful, soaringly, powerful, 7 octave voice I've ever heard and this CD is my favorite tied with Emotions. Every song on Music Box is a total masterpiece!!! There is not one song on this CD that I don't love. My favorites are Dreamlover which I can't listen to without singing and dancing, Hero (My all time favorite from Mariah. The song has such power, it's so meaningful and it's gotten me through a lot of hard obstacles in my life, not matter how many times I hear it, it never gets boring! My favorite version of Hero is live from the 1993 performance which can be heard on the Hero CD maxi single), Anytime You Need A Friend (I love the choir that sings in the background and every time I hear it, I feel like I'm in church with the words \\"If You Just Believe In me, I Will Love You Endlessly\\" which is what Jesus says in the Gospel!), Never Forget You (another amazing slow ballad and love the way Mariah sings), Without You (one of Mariah's best covers. Harry Nielson remake and Mariah's version is so much better and more beautiful than the original), Now That I know, Just To Hold You Once Again, and a ballad that has actually made me stop breathing for a second while it was playing a couple of times-All I Ever Wanted.<br /><br />All I Ever Wanted is the most powerful and romantic ballad Mariah has ever done in her whole career!! Her voice soars above anything and everything on this song, on this whole CD!! I am not married and hopefully I will get married one day and the song that I want playing when I have my first slow dance with my husband is All I Ever Wanted. It totally takes my breath away, vocally, musically and lyrically! If you are a romantic, you'll love All I Ever Wanted. I have had this CD since it came out in 1993 and I never have stopped listening to it, along with Emotions. Honestly, Music Box and Emotions are my favorite CD's of all time. Music Box really showcases Mariah's voice and music.<br /><br />Another song that I absolutely adore is the title track, Music Box. I love it because it actually features a music box and it's another song to showcase Mariah's amazing vocals!!! I also own the import of Music Box which includes THE BEST Mariah B-Side ever!!! The best, most incredible, most breathtaking B-Side ballad Mariah has ever done is called Everything Fades Away!! Everything Fades Away is such an incredible slow ballad and I love everything about this song. The music itself, the lyrics, amd most importantly, Mariah's angelic voice!!! The other B-Side, which also is an incredible slow ballad, that I also own on a Dreamlover single, is equal in every way to Everything Fades Away was only available on Mariah's Dreamlover single called Do You Think Of Me? If you are able to get Everything Fades Away and Do You Think Of Me?, they are so worth it!!! Even Mariah's B-Sides should have made it to number 1!!  I also have heard Mariah's Heroe, the Spanish version of Hero and it's amazing as well, before I heard this, I had no idea Mariah knew Spanish.  She sounds like she's been speaking the language forever.<br /><br />Music Box Spawned 2 #1's in the U.S. for Mariah. Dreamlover became Mariah's 7th #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hero was the 8th #1 on Billboard. The song Without You made it to number 1 on th U.K. charts but I feel that it should have made number 1 in the U.S. because it's one of Mariah's best vocal perfomances ever and every time I hear it, I get goosebumps!! I couldn't imagine not listening to this CD! A Must have for Mariah fans!!!CD's of all time.

0385513755|5.0|first off this book is 4 and a half stars. There are the critics who say it is oh so far fetched and they couldnt bear to enjoy it. Well the knights templar is real. They relly did go to israeal as guards (now whether or not they actually found solomons treasure well thats just speculation). But they actually did become very rich partly because they were the first bankers on record. It is also true that they were almost as influential as the king of spain so consequently they were slaughtered on friday the 13th. All of that is true. the only fiction in it is the priory of sion which was made up by some mad frenchman in order to scam people in the 20th century and of corse the charters and story. All im saying is that i recomend this book and to keep an open mind. Also maybe you should form your own opinion by doing your own research or reading \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\"
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carey has the most beautiful, powerful, soaringly 7 octave range voice I've ever heard!!! This Christmas CD has been in my CD collection since 1994 when it came out and I listen to it every year. Mariah makes all the traditional songs like Joy To The World, O Holy Night (my all time fav from this album and Mariah's version tops every other version out there ever!!!), Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town and others so beautiful and danceable especially her own song she wrote, All I Want For Christmas Is You (a song that I always find myself dancing to!). Another favorite is one she wrote called Miss You Most At Christmas Time, Mariah's voice soars!!! I also love Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child, such a wonderful gospel song!! I actually love Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child so much that if I was to sing just one song at my church, it would be Jesus, O What A Wonderful Child!! It's an incredible Gospel song and I love the choir and makes me feel so energized and makes me feel like I'm in church!! It has become my all time favorite Gospel song because I feel and hear so much energy throughout the song and Mariah is so amazing!!!<br /><br />Mariah's version of Joy To The World is incredible, Mariah really knows how to turn this classic into a dance hit!! I totally love how Mariah made a Club Mix and Celebration Mix to Joy To The World and the music video is awesome too! I love that part in the Celebration Mix when Mariah goes \\"Gonna Have A Good Time, There's A Party Over Here\\" and then you hear the Choir singing \\"Joy To The World, Joy To The World!\\" I like how she incorporated that one part from Three Dog Night's Joy To The World in \\"Joy To The World, All The Boys And Girls\\" and I just love how she is so upbeat and everything!!!  If you don't have the CD single of All I Want For Christmas Is You with the Club Mix and Celebration Mix of Joy To The World, I highly recommend you get it because it is well worth it!!<br /><br />I once let a guy friend I have who is also a Christian like I am, hear Mariah's Joy To The World and his words exactly were \\"This is a drinking song\\" and I was like, this is NOT a drinking song!! I don't take things like that seriously because I know Mariah meant no harm to include those few lyrics which also has all three real Joy To The World verses in it, it just made the song more unique and I love it!! Besides, the part \\"Joy To The World, All The Boys And Girls\\" fits Christmas perfectly, there's nothing wrong with putting that one part in the classic Joy To The World. Now, if she included the verses from Three Dog Night's song, there would be a problem! Yes, I am a Christian and I honestly see nothing wrong with just incorporating that one little part into the song that just makes it more unique! O Holy Night is by far the best song ever and Mariah's version could never be topped!! Mariah truly has the voice of an angel!!! I also like the remix of All I Want For Christmas that has a mix of hip-hop and R&B. This CD is definitely something I will be listening to forever! The bonus track, that was included on the import of Merry Christmas, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is awesome, I love Mariah's version!<br /><br />I love this whole CD from beginning to end, all 10 or 11 tracks, depending on which CD it is, over and over again and never get bored!! I love how on O Holy Night, she uses all her octaves and hits that really high note at the very end of the song, it really makes Mariah the best of all time!!! I love Mariah and always will!!!am, hear Mariah's Joy To The World and his words exactly were \\"This is a drinking song\\" and I was like, this is NOT a drinking song!! I don't take things like that seriously because I know Mariah meant no harm to include those few lyrics which also has all three real Joy To The World verses in it, it just made the song more unique and I love it!!

B000059XUP|4.0|I think that people are a little over critical about this one. I've seen few sequels that are remotely as good as the first. If you take this one as a stand alone project, you might have a different interpretation. It is a little darker and heavier than the first. So you really have to be in to this sort of thing to watch it. Vincent Perez, who is a wonderful actor, pulls off the role rather nicely. However, I will have to agree with some of the other reviews about his character not being real sure of where he's going or what his role is. I loved the way it was shot and the color pallette that was used. It really stuck to the original in that respect. However, the big bad was pretty lame. But overall, I have to say that I enjoyed the different view and the story that was being told. So if that means that there is something wrong with me, then so be it.
B0007YH4OE|5.0|Mariah Carey never ceases to amaze me!! Charmbracelet may not have been her best album vocally but what amazed me by that album was that it didn't sound like any other of her other albums and it was like that \\"My Saving Grace\\" song was made for me because since I am a Christian, I feel exactly the same, Lord Jesus is my saving grace. After just one listen to The Emancipation Of Mimi, it amazes me how Mariah is not afraid to take chances, she doesn't have to have every single album sound exactly alike, she does what she wants and doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. NO album is exactly alike. There's always progression. I am, always have been, and always will be Mariah's true and hugest fan!! It's like Mariah writes these songs for me, I mean that I can totally relate, I'm a girl so it's not literally for me but hopefully people will know what I mean!!! I totally love The Emancipation Of Mimi which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 charts and spawned Mariah's 16th #1!  As I am writing this review I have now listened to it over 200 times since it came out!!!<br /><br />The song It's Like That is so awesome to dance and sing along to. I love the music, the lyrics, and especially Mariah's powerful vocals! My all time favorite song is really hard to pick because there are two songs that I love and really can't decide between the two. We Belong Together is such a wonderful, beautiful slow ballad that reached number 1 on Billboard, Mariah's 16th #1, it's so powerful musically, vocally and lyrically and Mariah's voice is so amazing and everyone who thinks Mariah can't sing anymore, don't know what they're talking about because Mariah's voice is so incredible, especially on the end of this song!!! I totally love it!!!! The song Fly Like A Bird is such a spiritually, powerful song and it's amazing that Mariah wrote these words that I've been wanting to say, well I've been searching for the right words and it's Mariah who knew exactly what I was feeling toward the Lord. Mariah's church Minister or Pastor speaks throughout the song and \\"His Love Will Never Forsake You Or Leave You Alone, Trust Him\\" is forever in my soul. Words like \\"Carry Me Home, Higher Jesus, Carry Me Higher Lord\\" and \\"I Need You Now Lord, Carry Me High, I Need The Strength Of You By My Side\\" and \\"Keep Your Head To The Sky, With God's Love You'll Survive.\\" There is also a Choir singing. This song tells exactly how I feel toward the Lord Jesus and what I want to say to him. There's nothing better than my favorite singer of all time singing about my saviour, Lord Jesus!!! Another favorite of mine is Joy Ride. Not because my name is in the title, because it's such a cool pop song that you can sing along to and Mariah's vocals are over the top, especially at the very end of the song with Mariah doing that really high note and that long note she holds at the end, it's incredible!!!!! I love the music during the chorus of Joy Ride with drum and bass beats, it's awesome!!! Shake It Off is a really cool R&B upbeat song. Mine Again is another slow ballad that Mariah belts on. Mariah just about belts on every single song, especially on We Belong Together, Mine Again, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird. Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg is a really cool dance R&B song with a really cool beat to dance to and I find myself singing along to this song too. Stay The Night is a very soulful and unique song, the music reminds me of something from the 50's or 60's and I love the way Mariah sings and belts. I love It!! Get Your Number with Jermaine Dupri is a cool upbeat R&B song that I also like. One And Only with Twista is a cool mid-tempo song that I like a lot. Circles is another slow ballad that I love and love the way Mariah sings!! Your Girl is a really cool upbeat song and I love the way Mariah sings in the chorus, it's a really cool song to sing along to!!! In I Wish You Knew, Mariah speaks a few times during the song and you hear an audience, a very beautiful slow ballad, I especially love the end when Mariah hits that high note!!! To The Floor with Nelly could be the next club song, it's a really cool upbeat R&B/Hip-Hop song.<br /><br />When I hear the song Fly Like A Bird, I picture just soaring way up high in the clouds because the song just makes me think of being up there in the clouds, being free, and on Joy Ride, I picture being up in the stars because the whole song makes me picture being up there high and flying through the stars. If Mariah was to make a music video for Fly Like A Bird, I picture her just soaring through the clouds on an Eagles' wing or something and for Joy Ride, I picture Mariah soaring through the stars. Mariah sings with so much emotion, soul, and power on these songs, all 14 of them, using all 7 of her octaves, hitting that really high note a lot!!! There is all sorts of elements, Pop, Hip-Hop, Soul, Gospel, and R&B. I have noticed that a lot of people are stating that Mariah is in her 40's or 50's and that is NOT TRUE!! Mariah was born in 1970 so she's only 35! And I also noticed people are just assuming that every other track has a hip-hop collaboration. NOT TRUE!! Out of 14 tracks, only 4 of them have some kind of collaboration which means 10 of them are JUST MARIAH!!! And if you get the U.K. version, 11 are JUST MARIAH with Sprung. Mariah's new CD, The Emancipation Of Mimi is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes any of those elements I listed above and especially Mariah fans!!

B000066NW0|1.0|I bought Avril Lavigne's first album, &quot;Let Go,&quot; but it was a stupid mistake.  I even bought it for a stupid reason - because I had heard three songs from this girl, which were not too bad, but not great.  But when I listened to the whole CD, that's when I discovered the truth.  This stuff is so bad that I had to give this CD away.  I managed to sell it at a garage sale - thank God.  Here is a song-by-song review.  <br />Losing Grip - Most boring song on the album.  <br />Complicated - Her first single off the album.  Actually quite good for a modern-day song.  <br />Sk8er Boi - The second single that I heard.  Also pretty catchy. <br />I'm with You - The second worst of all her released singles (after Losing Grip). <br />Mobile - Pretty strange the way the instruments get louder during the chorus. <br />Unwanted - Worst one of all! Much too loud!  <br />Tomorrow - A lot quieter than the one before.  But still not my idea of a good song. <br />Anything But Ordinary - Quite a catchy tune, but if I compared it to classical music or the music my mom listens to from the '50s and '60s (which I listen to the most), I'm sure I wouldn't like it.  <br />Things I'll Never Say - Pretty stupid lyrics as well as an ugly sound.  <br />My World - Not much to say about this one.  But a bad song like the rest.  <br />Nobody's Fool - It sounds like she's rapping here rather than singing.  This song doesn't even fit in with the rest.    <br />Too Much to Ask - Very noisy song, like the others.  An ugly melody too!  <br />Naked - Stupid lyrics that don't even make sense.
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah must have been sent from up above to sing to the world because she really does have the voice of an angel. She has the most beautiful, soaringly, powerful, 7 octave voice I've ever heard and this CD is my favorite tied with Emotions. Every song on Music Box is a total masterpiece!!! There is not one song on this CD that I don't love. My favorites are Dreamlover which I can't listen to without singing and dancing, Hero (My all time favorite from Mariah. The song has such power, it's so meaningful and it's gotten me through a lot of hard obstacles in my life, not matter how many times I hear it, it never gets boring! My favorite version of Hero is live from the 1993 performance which can be heard on the Hero CD maxi single), Anytime You Need A Friend (I love the choir that sings in the background and every time I hear it, I feel like I'm in church with the words \\"If You Just Believe In me, I Will Love You Endlessly\\" which is what Jesus says in the Gospel!), Never Forget You (another amazing slow ballad and love the way Mariah sings), Without You (one of Mariah's best covers. Harry Nielson remake and Mariah's version is so much better and more beautiful than the original), Now That I know, Just To Hold You Once Again, and a ballad that has actually made me stop breathing for a second while it was playing a couple of times-All I Ever Wanted.<br /><br />All I Ever Wanted is the most powerful and romantic ballad Mariah has ever done in her whole career!! Her voice soars above anything and everything on this song, on this whole CD!! I am not married and hopefully I will get married one day and the song that I want playing when I have my first slow dance with my husband is All I Ever Wanted. It totally takes my breath away, vocally, musically and lyrically! If you are a romantic, you'll love All I Ever Wanted. I have had this CD since it came out in 1993 and I never have stopped listening to it, along with Emotions. Honestly, Music Box and Emotions are my favorite CD's of all time. Music Box really showcases Mariah's voice and music.<br /><br />Another song that I absolutely adore is the title track, Music Box. I love it because it actually features a music box and it's another song to showcase Mariah's amazing vocals!!! I also own the import of Music Box which includes THE BEST Mariah B-Side ever!!! The best, most incredible, most breathtaking B-Side ballad Mariah has ever done is called Everything Fades Away!! Everything Fades Away is such an incredible slow ballad and I love everything about this song. The music itself, the lyrics, amd most importantly, Mariah's angelic voice!!! The other B-Side, which also is an incredible slow ballad, that I also own on a Dreamlover single, is equal in every way to Everything Fades Away was only available on Mariah's Dreamlover single called Do You Think Of Me? If you are able to get Everything Fades Away and Do You Think Of Me?, they are so worth it!!! Even Mariah's B-Sides should have made it to number 1!!<br /><br />Music Box Spawned 2 #1's in the U.S. for Mariah. Dreamlover became Mariah's 7th #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hero was the 8th #1 on Billboard. The song Without You made it to number 1 on the U.K. charts but I feel that it should have made number 1 in the U.S. because it's one of Mariah's best vocal perfomances ever and every time I hear it, I get goosebumps!! I couldn't imagine not listening to this CD! A Must have for Mariah fans!!!ll time. Music Box really showcases Mariah's voice and music.

B0007PAMEM|5.0|THERE IS PROBABLY NO GREATER PERFORMER ANYWHERE. THIS COLLECTION OF LIVE PERFORMANCES IS FUN TO WATCH. SHE'S ENERGETIC, AS USUAL, ALWAYS A 110%, THE BAND IS GREAT, AND LOTS OF COOL STAGE EFFECTS. SPECIAL GUESTS INCLUDE DAVID BOWIE AND BRYAN ADAMS. A HIGHLIGHT FOR ME WAS THE LIVE VERSION OF THE THEME FROM 'GOLDENEYE'.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This may possibly be the best album ever recorded. It absolutely blows away the dying U2 and self-absorbed Radiohead schlock that we've had to endure the past few years.

B00006CXXU|2.0|Christina... were do I start. First of all I remember loving the genie in a bottle, I mean the sexy genie in da bottle back in 1999. The blonde hair, the great smile and her angelic style in white, but all the sudden BLACK HAIR, MEDIUM SKIN COLOR, BLACK DRESSES and BLACK NAILS. I hate the dirty songs of this album the only song that i really like is the voice within and it is for girls, and what the heck about her million boy fans that she has, Christina has forgoten about us and saying stupid things about guys like in cant hold us down. Leave all the rock and evil style to Amy Lee she looks better in it. Its the only one that it fits to her but, Christina needs to go back to her style or else she will turn into everybodys clown and I will buy the tickets to the circus to see what style Christina has today !!
B000002U82|4.0|No, that title belongs to either the tribute Wish You Were Here or the darker Animals. Almost every track is amazing, with the exception of On The Run-a mediocre track at best, especcially by Floyd. Standouts are Time, Us and Them, and Brain Damage/Eclipse. By anybody else? A perfect 5.  But this is Floyd.
B00006ADGP|4.0|I loved the movie but the dvd quality is one of the worst ever seen. It looks like a pirated copy; even the frames run every now and then.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Alright, so seeing as how I'm comment #312, I don't imagine that anyone is going to read my review, or that anyone will be encouraged to watch or buy the Special Edition DVD of Hellboy because of anything that I'll say. There are others who have written short novels on Amazon  about what a great movie this is, so there's no point in me doing more of the same.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that this movie is beautifully shot, well acted (with the exception of the kid who plays the FBI agent) and directed by masterful Guillermo Del Toro with style and grace. It's not for everyone, and those who are fans of the comic will probably enjoy it more than your average moviegoer. But if you like movies like The Crow or Darkman, this one is right down your dark little alley.
B000002MY3|5.0|From the moment I popped this CD into my iMac, I knew I would fall in love with Alanis' songs. <br /> <br />I was right. <br /> <br />Although \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" wasn't my first Alanis CD, that didn't mean that it wouldn't be my favorite. I automatically fell in love with the first song, \\"All I Really Want.\\" Alanis is probably one of the most deep artists in the entire world (excluding Bjrk.) Unlike other particular songs, Alanis' work appeals to me because her songs have a multitude of reality in them; like most people, I perceived Alanis as this angry, depressed woman. I hope Alanis will churn out even more CDs, as \\"So-Called Chaos\\" wasn't bad at all. Buy this CD; you won't regret it at all. <br /> <br />**HIGHLY recommended**
0975991477|5.0|FINALLY!, A book that backs my intuition of knowing since I <br />was a child that humans have the potential to be able to reach unlimitations and all knowing, therefore having the ability to heal and create wholeness within the mind, body and spirit. Up until now, I could not scientifically prove it, thank you Bruce Lipton for proving it!!! It is only the fear and limitations that one may have within, that objects to the TRUTH! It is time <br />humanity wakes-up. Keep up the excellent work Bruce. <br /> <br />Genevieve West, Costa Mesa, CA <br />
B0009A1AS2|3.0|The first time I heard this album I wasn't sure exactly what Dream Theater were trying to accomplish, lyrically and musically.  The highlights of this album, in my estimation, are the songs \\"These Walls\\" and \\"Panic Attack\\".  Both of these tracks most resemble the Dream Theater sound and have the lyrical melody and musicianship I expect from the band.  The other tracks are average when I compare them to some of the bands past efforts.  As for the overall sound of the album, it is definitely lighter than Train of Thought (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  It is a nice break from a lot of the so-called \\"nu-metal\\" garbage that exists today.  However, I'm hoping the band can achieve a sound somewhere between \\"Awake\\" and \\"Train of Thought\\" for the next album.
B0007P3582|1.0|Gah!!! This overplayed idiot is back!! Don't get me wrong.. I actually like Get Rich or Die Tryin', but I think its time 50 stopped. Candy Shop is overplayed garbage, I cannot see why everyone likes it. All he sings about is getting shot, 2pac, and how many girls he can screw in a night. This is crap at its worst.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Guess God thinks I'm Abel is my favorite track. This album has regenerated the Oasis spirit, although, What's the Story Morning Glory is one of the best albums ever.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.    In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.   I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.   Whether it's physical comedy, dry humor or even witty humor, Grant always seems to come through.  Once again, Grant comes through big time in the Romantic Comedy \\"Two Weeks Notice\\".   In this film, Hugh Grant is teamed up with Sandra Bullock.   Grant once again delivers a terrific performance, but the surprise of the movie comes from supporting actress Alicia Witt.  Witt shows why she is a rising talent in Hollywood.    The film takes place in New York City with an emphasis on Coney Island in Brooklyn.  The story of the film involves Bullock's character Lucy Kelson.   Lucy is a crusading attorney seeking to save a Community Center in Coney Island from Demolition.  The company that is trying to demolish the center is the Wade Corporation - which is led by Hugh Grant's George Wade character.    George is a young handsome and popular New York Real Estate Developer.  When Lucy confronts George on the issue, George offers her a job as his Chief Legal Counsel.  Lucy decides to take the job as it will give her the resources to fight for many of her causes.   Lucy moves into her new job, but instead of providing legal counsel to George on business matters - she soon finds herself giving advice and counsel to many personal issues involving George's life.    Lucy soon finds herself at George's beckon-call on almost everything.  Getting frustrated with George's dependence on her - Lucy offers her resignation and gives George's 'two weeks notice'.  George accepts Lucy's resignation and Lucy agrees to help find a replacement.  The replacement turns out to be Alicia Witt's June Carter character.   When George begins to hit things off very well both professionally and personally with June, feelings of jealousy begin to surface.  At first, neither George or Lucy can admit feelings for each other - but things end up very predictably in the end.    As mentioned, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.   While in movies such as \\"Nine Months\\", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, we see Grant focus on his witty sense of humor. Throughout the movie, Grant comes back with several one-liners and these are delivered flawlessly.  An example of this is when Lucy tries to find another job and George calls all prospective employers trying to stop them from hiring her.   Lucy gets wind of this and confronts George.   Lucy tells George \\"You called everyone but Slurpee Heaven\\".  George responds \\"That is not true.  I did call Slurpee Heaven.  They didn't want you.  Said you had attitude.  Said you weren't Slurpee material\\".   This is just one example on how Grant is able to pull off the character of George Wade perfectly.  There are numerous examples of this.   While on the surface, it may seem that anyone could pull of this witty humor - I find with Hugh Grant this is genuine and it works.    I've always found Sandra Bullock an overrated actress.   While Bullock has a good fit at playing the \\"high maintenance\\"  Lucy Kelson character,  While even after seeing Bullock's Lucy Kelson character, I still think she is overrated - I do think there was good chemistry between Bullock and Grant.   \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" does employ a common Romantic Comedy formula of two people not getting along - but being drawn close together.   Bullock and Grant's chemistry seems to fit this formula well, thus makes the movie enjoyable.  As mentioned above, I felt Alicia Witt became an emerging star in this movie.   Witt does a great job at playing June Carter.  At first June is the timid new-hire out of college.  But Witt does a great job at transforming June into the young opportunist that becomes the perfect rival for Lucy Kelson.   While I wouldn't tag June as the \\"villain\\" of the movie, she clearly is pitted against Lucy in the movie - especially when it becomes clear that June's real motives are more for George himself as opposed to the job.    One thing I really enjoyed was the New York City setting for this movie.  While I've always preferred Hugh Grant when the setting is in England (\\"Nine Months\\" and \\"About a Boy\\"), I like that how Grant fits into New York City and Coney Island.    Parts of the film were shot on-location in Coney Island.   While I think it's a fair criticism that the film doesn't show the real Coney Island (an area of Brooklyn that still is in need of being cleaned-up), I do think the film does a terrific job at showing that there still are some positives about the Coney Island area.   The film also features a Helicopter ride that George and Lucy take - that gives a great view and insight of New York.   There also is a terrific scene filmed on the Queensboro Bridge when Lucy is in desperate  need of using a bathroom, but unfortunately is in a major traffic jam.    There are some interesting cameos in the movie.  New York Mets Catcher Mike Piazza has a cameo when George and Lucy are at a Mets game at Shea Stadium.  Donald Trump (whom is portrayed as George's Real Estate Developer rival for obvious reasons) has an encounter with George as a fundraising party.   Finally, Norah Jones has a cameo as a Piano Singer.     Overall, this is a great movie to check out.   Romantic Comedy and Hugh Grant fans will not be disappointed.   But even if you aren't a fan of these two - there is a great charm to this movie.  Highly recommended.
0670033693|4.0|This is a well crafted mystery involving, on several levels, sadness, retribution, redemption and coming of age. Portions of it reminded me of the works of Donald Harstad, also a Sheriff, and James Lee Burke's Billy Bob Holland character. All these men come from an geography many of us are unfamiliar with and also to a great extent, with relationships that are new to us. Here Sheriff Walt Longmire's friendship with Henry Standing Bear would be the first popular National novel of a \\"Buddy\\" novel with a Native American person, except for my own geographic compatriot Steve Hamilton who writes the Alex McKnight series. McKnight's best friend, you might remember, is Vinnie LeBlanc, an Ojibwa indian.<br /><br />But as Holmes says, 'I digress.' Good story in the far reaches of the west, close to the Little Big Horn massacre and remnants of the Cheyenne Indian Nation. Mellisa, a teenage Native American girl with fetal alcohol syndrome is gang raped by four caucasion High School scoundrels. Light, near 'probationary' sentences for the horrific crime smolder an already tense relationship between the reservation and for lack of a better word, the \\"townies.\\"<br /><br />Great characters in Sheriff Longmire, widowed 4 years earlier, Lucian, the crotchety one-legged former Sheriff who trained Walt, Vic Moretti, the tough as nails Philadelphia woman police officer Walt wants to make Sheriff when he retires, and a lot more. When the first of the 4 young adults is shot and killed from long range by a high powered rifle, all these forces and people come into play.<br /><br />The strength of Craig Johnson's book is the beauty of his writing. He definitely is a gifted author, somewhat like the aforementioned Burke who can write poetically sentences that you just have to stop and read over and over.<br /><br />The second strong point is the character of the characters. They're all different, from Ruby, the grandmother dispatcher trying to master police \\"lingo\\" to Moretti who is highly technically skilled but unable to finish a sentence without an explitive deleted in it.<br /><br />The weak point I think was that some of the dialogue became immature. I just don't see the constant quipping between the two powerful men with gunshot wounds, joking about lunch or suspects in the case. It reminded me, again in parts, of Starsky and Hutch TV movies or Han Solo talking to Chewbaca. It's a small point but I think it detracted from the rawness and the beauty of the effort.<br /><br />An excellent book and worth the time. I hope Mr. Johnson favors us with more. You might want to catch William Landay's debut novel \\"Mission Flats\\" which takes palce in Boston. But \\"Cold Dish\\" is likewise a great first book. 4 stars.

B00005IC2H|5.0|One of my favorite albums ever, from one of my favorite bands. No one has, or ever will, make music this beautiful. It is better that i don't understand the words, because no words could match the sound that they achieve. Get it now if you truly appreciate music.
0064440346|5.0|I am 33 and have only saved a handfull of books from my childhood.  \\"Owl at Home\\" is one of them and by far my favorite, then and now.  I love reading it to my three year old and I hope that she will save it for her children.  The whimsical antics of Owl match the silly atmosphere in our home and encourage original thinking.
B000000OQF|5.0|Man. What can I say about this album besides the fact its freakin' good. Not a single bad song on here; in my opinion the greatest debut album of all time. Period. Hands down. No questions asked. <br /> <br />The first time I heard 'Welcome to the Jungle' I was in awe. It had the catchiest guitar riffs and Axl's blazing vocals made it even better. I immediately demanded a trip to the local CD Store to purchase Appetite for Destruction. <br /> <br />If you like hard rock or classic rock, buy this! You won't regret it!
B00000J2PH|5.0|this album really belongs in every record collection.   <br /> <br />I know this because this album was handed to me as a tattered vinyl record, played far beyond its physical constraints.  In spite of the fact that it was sonically deficient from repeated playings, this album was driven into the ground by its own merrits. <br /> <br />If you pride yourself on musical knowledge, this album belongs at the forefront of your collection.  There's really no other way to stress its importance.

0446310786|5.0|Like most teenagers, I read this novel in Grade 10 as part of an English class.  I noted then it wasn't a bad book for a 'classic'.  I have since read this book twice more, most recently in June 2005.  Each time I read this book, I learn more from it and pick up things I missed previous times or perhaps I didn't miss them I'm just older and have learned to understand so many more things. <br /> <br />This novel is narrated by Scout and takes place over three summers in Maycomb county.  Scout, her older brother Jem and their summer time friend Dill have typical summer vacation for children of the south during the Depression.  They make up plays, they have a treehouse, there is a scarey neighbourhood house.  Scout starts the first line of the novel saying she remembers the summer that her brother Jem broke his arm.  From that line forward we learn about the events that lead to this and most importantly the summer that their father, Atticus represented a black man, Tom Robinson against the state and a white but trashy family, the Ewells. <br /> <br />If you have't picked up this book since highschool - I recommend you give it an adult read.
076790592X|1.0|It feels like you're being force-fed Mitch's thoughts on Morrie's death. And Morrie didn't even feel genuine. His words were moving, granted, but he said the kinds of things you should have realized for yourself anyway.  And he also seemed more like a character in a novel than a real person as Mitch turned him into a caraciture through the hefty use of simplistic literary devices.  Morrie became Mitch's vehicle. Which is strange to me. Throughout the book you get the impression that Mitch is some sort of blockhead not to realize Morrie's advice, but at the same time you have to consider he must be pretty smart to have manipulated the contents of the book so well, to make so many people love Morrie and think that Mitch had absorbed something substantial.
630349255X|5.0|I was originally shown this movie by one of the best teachers I've ever had in high school.  The movie is truly beautiful, showing us the connection between people, animals, and our own environment.  We all need to heed the hidden messages in this wonderful movie.  As for the negative comments about the \\"violent\\" elements, I think that these also had a hidden message if you were watching closely enough-perhaps we need to see both the good and the bad of our world to understand it properly.  If you found it boring, perhaps you aren't enough in touch with the world to see how important these scenes are.

B00003CX5P|4.0|After six years, I finally bought this movie on DVD. Only had it on VHS. As a practitioner of the Star Wars fan boy alliance (not really), I finally want to share my thoughts about the prequel trilogy starting with my second favorite of the three: Episode I. <br /> <br />Even though this film starts the saga, I recommend, even for first timers, to watch the original trilogy first, Because without them, this one just doesn't give a proper introduction to the galaxy far far away. Except the first time Jedi take out lightsabers on the Federation ship. When I saw this movie in 1999, I was amazed how much of the pace was very similar to Episode IV, the original Star Wars, since it was the only one of the original trilogy to had been directed by George Lucas. Now he returns in the director's seat with this trilogy, and it is great. Now, don't mind all the \\"wooden dialogue\\" accusations, although they are true. But, if you don't understand the plot, with all due respect, you have no business whatsoever watching this film and you must have ADD. Like in the original trilogy, i believe, contrasting what many people might think, this is a movie that requires your full attention to really grasp and feel for the characters. The story is only confusing if you don't know anything about this little planet we live in, because the political conflict in the movie is pretty clear, despite what some dumb dumbs might think.  <br /> <br />Also, this takes me back to the original trilogy. Without watching that first, you really don't know where this political thing is leading to. Unless, you are watching the whole saga as a big movie, it can leave a lot of open spots. Visually, I think it is the best of the trilogy. The lightsabers look the best in this movie. In the last 2 the color on the sabers is too strong, and the sound isn't as thunderous as that last battle with Darth maul at the end of this one. <br /> <br />Like the original Star Wars, what's so great about this movie is that it can be a stand alone film (sorta, if you don't really count the destiny that will befall on the characters on account of everything that happens here). It's a nice sci fi adventure, with fun action and deep Star Wars philosophy and myth, although, once again many people didn't seem to appreciate it. Of course, the movie is just one piece of the puzzle, the problem is that each piece left a big whole Lucas filled every 3 years, which is why this films I think were received the way they were. They left too many questions and doubts.  <br /> <br />The acting was FINE. Star Wars is no place for over actors, specially when you are portraying a centered and peaceful Jedi. It was FINE. In the context of all the films this one definitely stands out and I hope more people see that. <br /> <br />If you wanna get into Star Wars, forget about a rental, because if you are serious about it, you'll definitely buy it. you will not regret it, unless you are one of this close minded people who don't understand how fantasy can look at the human spirit right at its core.
B0006A9FKA|3.0|So what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker?  Well if you are British, you get Shaun of the Dead.  The movie starts out following Shaun around his mundane life.  He's still working at a computer store.  He still sits in front of the TV flipping channels with his buddy Ed, who is a bigger loser than Shaun is.  But his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him.  Oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies, not that Shaun or Ed even notice.  That's until Ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden.  This gives Shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back, sweep her off her feet and take her to safety.  But Shaun and Ed are no Will Smith and Bruce Willis so hilarity ensues. <br /> <br />The major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary.  With a movie that mixes humor with gore, there should be a least one going on at all time.  Another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a British film.  While I was watching it, I wondered out load, \\"Why would Shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that?\\"  Someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat.  And there were a few places where the British slang just went over of my head. <br /> <br />The DVD extras include the usual trailer, documentaries (extremely boring), deleted and extended scenes (good choice taking these out), and blooper reel.  One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story.  No if only every movie did this.  Also, during the film, Shaun and Ed flip through the TV pretty quickly, so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with Coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the British version of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br />With everything that had be popular oversees, I predicted we will get an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead (spelled Shawn instead) within five years with Stifler as Shawn, Jack Black as Ed, Kate Bosworth as Liz, the nerdy dude from The O.C. as David, some token hot chick as Dianne, and Burt Reynolds as Phillip.  And in hopes to rejuvenate his career, Michael Jackson will don the Thriller makeup one more time to be the head zombie that leads the other zombie in a zombie dance.  Just make sure Shawn grabs a baseball bat out of the shed.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Twister is possibly one of the best movies ever to grace a screen. I remember that I used to watch every day when it first came out, and I still do as much as possible. As soon as the movie starts, the action is on. The opening scene tells the story of how the lead character, Joanne loses her Dad to an F5 tornado, that are so powerful they are refered to as the \\"finger of God.\\" <br /> <br />Years later, now an adult, she and a team scientists chase after tornados in order to learn more about them. And with the new invention \\"Dorothy\\" a machine that can study the inside of a twister, they can learn more than ever before. But in order to use the device, it must be placed directly in the damage path of a twister.  <br /> <br />The acting is superb, all the characters are very likable, accept of course the ones you aren't supposed to like (Jonas), and there is plenty of destruction. Buy this movie and buckle up, because it's going to be a wild ride.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Bought the pan-and-scan laserdisc. Bought the deluxe 20th anniversary laserdisc. Bought the 25th anniversary DVD. Now I've got the 30th anniversary DVD. And I don't feel cheated one bit.  <br /> <br />Why? Because the original mono tracks are back. For someone who knows the film frame by frame, it's well worth the 15-20 bucks to be rid of that awful surround mix. It seemed so anemic, with sound effects that used to roar reduced to a whimper. (Unfortunately, Jaws has plenty of company in the crummy stereo remix department.) <br /> <br />The full documentary is nice to have, the booklet's cool, and on and on. But for those of us who've seen this thing 50-plus times, seeing it and HEARING it the way it's supposed to be is the most \\"deluxe\\" feature of all.
B0001HAISG|3.0|I love the story of Peter Pan and was excited to see this thing in theaters. I was disappointed, but not overly so. I loved the actor that played Peter Pan, but I found his yelling when he was flying or fighting a bit much and annoying. I loved the young beautiful girl who played Wendy, but her teeth were...interesting to say the least. It was so obvious they were fake. What was wrong with her natural ones?     All in all, the movie *is* fun to watch. I'm sure the young kids may like it. :)
B00081U6EG|2.0|Let's cut to the chase, shall we?  The reason I obtained this dvd was because I love guitar and want to obtain the best guitar dvds out there.  This DVD is pretty darn lame for a show that's supposed to be celebrating the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar on the occasion of it's 50th Anniversary, a huge milestone for a pop culture icon.  There are basically two reasons to buy it: Gary Moore's incendiary tribute to Jimi Hendrix on \\"Red House,\\" so hot it will melt your dvd player, and David Gilmour's three songs. <br /> <br />The rest is pretty tepid and the roster features some no-name talent that have NO Business being on that stage: Theresa Andersson!?  Who?  Yeah, she plays guitar, but she's a rhythm player.  Jamie Cullum?!  Who?!  Nobody in his band even PLAYS guitar!  What were these producers even thinking putting a keyboard band like this on the bill, LET ALONE the video?  Amy Winehouse?!  Who?  She's a weak singer that can barely hold her own on Karoake Night at Billy Bob's BBQ-O-Rama and would got stomped by \\"American Idol's\\" Simon. <br /> <br />A few other fret-grinders play well: Hank Marvin (great version of \\"Sleepwalk\\"), Albert Lee, and Brian May.  Paul Rodgers is in excellent voice.  Joe Walsh slogs through four tunes, but his playing here cannot hold a candle to his monumental performance on Clapton's \\"Crossroad\\" Guitar concert DVD.  He looks very tired and shagged out. <br /> <br />The All-Star jam at the end is awful, mostly because they chose a poor vehicle for guitar soloing, Rod Stewart's \\"Stay With Me.\\"   <br /> <br />Where were the rest of the Stratocaster greats?  Ever hear of a guy named Eric Clapton?  Fender even sells a Clapton Strat model.  If I am organizing this show, I organize it around Clapton's schedule and I don't do it without him!  How about Richie Blackmore, Yngvie Malmsteen, Jeff Beck (another guy you cannot do a Strat tribute show without), Mark Knopfler, and a slew of others I am no doubt forgetting. <br /> <br />The packaging for the DVD is so poor it bears commenting.  The DVD's graphic design is incredibly weak...it drags the entire product into B-grade level.  Staid and trite font choices along with cookie-cutter presentation of photos is at a quality level high school seniors can produce in a few days in Photoshop.  The producers, Eagel Rock Productions, either were too cheap to hire real graphic designers and artists or their staffers need to go back to design school for a few more years. <br /> <br />The show has a very UK-bent to it (shot in the UK at London's Wembley Arena), which is odd since Fender is an American company.  How you stage a production like this for such an important occasion in rock and pop culture without the requisite talent is beyond me. A much better value for your money is Clapton's \\"Crossroads\\" Concert DVD.  All this being said, it bears repeating that Gary Moore's \\"Red House\\" really captures the spirit of the celebrated electric guitar and the event.  The producers of this show at least go that right, and it's one of the greatest versions of \\"Red House\\" I've ever heard. <br /> <br />One can only hope when the 75th Anniversary of The Strat comes around, they look back on this terrible flop for the 50th and produce a show worthy of this great electric instrument.
B000957O7S|5.0|I rented this DVD, watched it twice and have come online to order it.  This is a collectable!  I have tried to identify a weak point in this show and cannot find it.  Absolutely loved it!  Thought all the characters were great, and the production had the perfect balance of humor and tender romance.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you dig jazz, especially the really far-out stuff, then you will really be able to get into this. However, many rock fans may not be able to fully grasp this. Lateralus, and I suppose Tool in general, is by no means heavy metal. It is avant-garde music that will send shivers down your spine and electrical charges to your mind. Open up and challenge yourself. <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album is excellent guys.  I walked into a music store and the cover caught my eye, not that it was anything in particular that is appealing about it but I chose to listen to it.  I began to get sucked in by there style of how old metal was.  I bought the album and have been quite satisfied with it.  Once i got home and looked them up online I was surprised at their other albums because they cannot compare to this one.  I am not a fan of bands screaming every single lyric into the mic so their transition through my eyes have been quite successful and i think all those who dissapprove should look at their lyrics listen to the music until they realize, they changed for the better.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Holy sh*!@balls!  This album is so hot.  It will take you to another place.  I have always been a SOTD fan, but this one symbolizes everything the band is striving for.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B000002U82|5.0|The Dark Side of The Moon(TDSOTM) is one of the best works of music to bless this universe.  The entire album flows like no other album created.  It is best if you listen to it all at once so you can get a feel for how good the album is.  While the album has many recurring themes, each song is unique in its own way.  The bottom line is, buy this album, and you won't be dissappointed.
B0000029DD|5.0|I like Coldplay a lot, but the first time I heard them, I thought, \\"man, they're just ripping off the dead Jeff Buckley's vocal style and pawning it off as their own.\\"  But I saw an interview with Chris Martin who fronts Coldplay and said straight up that Jeff Buckley was his biggest influence.  Since I heard that concession, Coldplay was then alright in my book.    Jeff Buckley was a phenom.  Extraordinary.  Talented. Gifted.  Inspiring.  And uncompromising in his effort to produce the best he could while he was alive.  Not only did the guy have four-octave range vocally (bigger than Mariah Carey's range), but his grasp on music theory was definite.  He could play alternate tunings, jam with any musician on the fly, pick the right scale for the right feeling, and so forth.  But his heart is the base and source for all his music.  You can tell besides all the talent and training and knowledge that Jeff played for the human heart, others as well as himself.  After hearing the authenticity in his voice, one can tell that he's not trying to sell millions of records and be some stuck-up millionare but rather trying to connect into chambers of the mind and heart and let people know and feel they're not alone in this sometimes hard life.  Jeff to me seems like the kind of humble guy you can have a beer with and just talk about anything and everything and you would have no idea just how out-of-this-world his music is.    Again, if you like Coldplay, listening to Jeff Buckley will show you how much he influenced Chris Martin.  Not saying Coldplay is some copyband because they do have their own sound but you hear Jeff in their music just as you can \\"hear\\" Robert Johnson in the Rolling Stones or Eric Clapton.
0975991477|5.0|It's about time someone in science and research published a book the average lay person can understand with this incredible information. Dr. Lipton's research and findings are leading MANY people in a direction previously not even known to be an option.  With his research we can finally remove ourselves from the victimized roles we've played for so long and reclaim control of our life!  Hearing the information Dr. Lipton has to share for the first time can be QUITE shocking, as was for me! Since learning about his research (initially via the video 'The Biology of Belief/The Psychology of Change') my entire life has been altered. This information gives us the power AND responsiblity for our own lives (attitudes, symptoms and otherwise).  If only this information could be delivered to our children as part of THEIR BIOLOGY curriculum!  What a difference we'd create, see and experience in our world!  THANK YOU Dr. Lipton!!  There is a shift in awareness and consciousness upon us!
038572179X|4.0|I did not like the book after reading the first few chapters. The writing was beautiful but not focused enough. But I kept reading because of all the good reviews about the book, and I was rewarded with one of the best stories in a long time. I just couldn't stop reading until I finished the book. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the slow start.
B000002H6C|5.0|Wow, this is probably the choice word for describing the whole package that Metallica's forth album presents. From long, complex passages contained in the near 10 minute title track, trash breakdowns in One, and crushing, heavy riffs in Eye of the Beholder, \\"...And Justice For All\\" makes a strong argument as the pinnacle of Metallica's career. From a musical point of view, this album is unbeatable, as amongst the progressive complexity of this album, there are countless flashes of pure brilliance, showing how far Metallica has evolved musically since their 1986 masterpiece, \\"Master of Puppets\\". <br /> <br />Despite the lack of bass in the mix, the production is not as bad as some say, just be sure to use a decent sound system, as the low end can sound a bit hollow at times, especially during the slower, heavier parts (ie: To Live is to Die). As for the actual tracks on the record, each one is a definite keeper, but One, Dyers Eve and the title track stand above as the cream of the crop. <br /> <br />While this may not be my favourite Metallica album, from a musical standpoint, it is their best, and an excellent starting point for any new Metallica fan.
6301763041|5.0|If you are a die hard Johnny Depp fan, or John Waters fan, or you just want to get up on your table and have a fun time dancing, then Crybaby should definitely be on your wish list. Not only is this 1990 John Water's comedy funny and clever, but it features a young Johnny Depp doing his take on an elvis-look alike teen in the 1950's.    This heartwarming story is about the battle between the squares (rich preps) and the drapes (the motorcycle riding types), and the two that got caught in the middle. These two happen to be a boy named Wade \\"Crybaby\\" Walker, nicknamed for his ability to cry on command, and Alison Vernon-Williams, a rebel who just happens to be the daughter of one of the richest families in town.     Despite its drama-like plot, John Waters does a fantastic job of creating a friendly, happy-go-lucky atmosphere that sucks you in and doesn't let you out. It's a cheesy film with acting that is a little less than professional, however, but the fantastic soundtrack makes up for it.    I recommed this movie to anybody! 5 stars
B000002UJQ|5.0|After Radiohead literally re-invented anthemic rock with their second album \\"The Bends\\" they somehow and someway spit out a third record that was even better than their groundbreaking second album. And while \\"the Bends\\" dabbled with the typical straightforward rock ballads, OK computer dives headfirst into lyrically and sonically complex music. Not as if the Bends was not complex, but it was not as dense as OK computer was. For OK computer is truly a dense album; a sprawling yet compact album that is as focused as it is intense and creative. It requires thorough listening to appreciate its complete and total brilliance. As it has become a cliche to deem an album one that is well rewarded after repeated listens, it is fair to say that OK Computer was the album that literally created the saying. It is rewarding after each listen in so many ways, from song structure to lyrical structure to the actual structure of the album. New sounds are revealed each listen; abstract bleeps subtly complement soft acoustic guitars; strings slip in amidst Yorke's painful, howling cries. The musical layering here on OK Computer is so complex that it requires seperate listens to appreciate each track and its components. Lyrically, Yorke has never been any better than he was on OK Computer. From the heartbreaking \\"Let Down,\\" where Yorke sings about the emptiness of society and the feeling of being trapped, to \\"Paranoid Android,\\" where he savagely rips apart corporate phonies who climb the ladder in their capitalistic greed, Yorke does it beautifully, tenderly and angrily. His voice remains the finest of the decade(yes, better than Chris Martins). There are no weak tracks here on OK, yet after numerous listens, tracks that seemingly took a backseat in earlier listens begin to shine even brighter. \\"The Tourist\\" is a wonderful ballad about an idiotic, unnapreciative and clueless tourist(most likely an American) that is overlooked in the initial awe of listening to the rest of the album first. Very much the same with \\"Lucky,\\" and \\"Airbag\\" these two songs might be known as the \\"track before Paranoid Android, and the track after No Suprises, yet they remain some of Radioheads finest. The album never lets up; it's \\"weaker tracks\\" remain ballads many bands would die to call their own. All in all, OK Computer is a complex, enthralling, sprawling, ambitious, and dangerous album. It takes risks but is never over-ambitious. Radiohead have always been able to work within their limits; though it is easy for them because their talents don't allow for many limits. Perhaps overlooked as everybody's favorite rock band when skittronica KidA came out, and Chris Martin and Co. came in, Radiohead was and still is one of the finest and talented rock bands. If you were to pick any album to show this, OK Computer would be it.
B00000K3D4|3.0|I just recently watched this film again after not seeing it for many many years.  I think it is a good film, but not great (atleast not for adults.)  The music is sort of catchy, but terribly outdated.  David Bowe and Jennifer Conneley are terrific actors.  I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts of Jerad the goblin king and Sarah the lonely teen.  I think the humor is pretty poor, but the plot does have some suspense and very good lessons about the dangers of selfishness and narrow mindedness, qualities most common in teens.  Jen's character \\"Sarah\\" changes from being a self centered, know- it- all brat into a compassionate young lady.  The goblin puppets are of excellent quality and I think would probably scare a child under 8.  I think this film appeals most to the junior high crowd. The making of the labyrinth documentary is fascinating. I loved finding out how the puppets worked.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has had hit after hit over the years, but when she finally broke free of Sony's restrictive hold on her, the first album \\"Charmbracelet\\" felt like it was lacking some of the power behind the still great lyrics.  It left some wondering if maybe she needed the powerhouses behind her.  But with \\"Emancipation of Mimi,\\" Mariah proves she doesn't need anyone but herself to soar up the charts to number one and stay there.   <br /> <br />Sure there are some great collaborations (with Snoop, JD, Twista, Nelly) on \\"Emancipation,\\" but the most important thing is that Mariah's voice is back.  On \\"Charmbracelet\\" she tried this sultry whisper thing, to be softer and a bit more subtle.  She always has had the incomparable vocal range, and that should be exploited.  Here she sings back at the top of her range, allowing listeners once again to be amazed.  In a world where technologically enhanced music and lipsynching has become the norm (ahem Britney and Hillary), it is more than refreshing to see Mariah still able to compete...and knock everyone else out of the game. <br /> <br />The best songs off this album are: \\"We Belong Together\\" (the second single) for its harmony, \\"Say Somethin\\" (the third single, for the flow with Snoop), and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (for its power and message), but in the end they are all excellently done and will have you listening to the CD on repeat.  It's been in my car ever since it dropped, and that's more than two months ago. I didn't want to like \\"To The Floor,\\" simply because I don't like Nelly, but even that one won me over-- The Neptunes produced a great beat that really complements her.  Twista's part in \\"One and Only\\" is a bit tedious because he manages to referece \\"rims\\" four times, but hey-- not everyone can be the lyricist Mariah is. <br /> <br />This album really does feel like it sets Mariah free. She says things on it she never has (and never would have) before, and she tackles it all: power ballads, gospel, dance/party tracks, and hiphop collaborations.
B00005JNTX|1.0|WAIT for the SE!  If you are not a DVD collector, and don't care about double-disc sets and extras, then go right ahead.  Otherwise, this is a bare-bones ploy to get your $$$.  (BTW - movie is 5 stars.)
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Pure and simple. This is one of DT BEST releases ever! I can't think of any one DT release that's better than this one. Some people seem upset that this may be a bit softer overall compared to their last cd Train of Thought. And it is softer than that one but this cd still kicks butt and has more than enough heavy moments to satisfy any open minded Dream Theater fan. <br /> <br />Look. DT already did a balls to the wall cd with train of thought. Do we really need a carbon copy of that again? I say no. This new cd was a well needed one to bring balance to the DT catalog of releases. <br /> <br />For the people who wrote negative or unsure reviews of this cd, I say to them: \\"Just open your minds a tiny bit and you'll have to agree that this is one of DT best cd's ever!\\".  <br /> <br />In fact, this might be my favorite DT cd ever!!
B0009353IW|5.0|I would like to point out the sudden political relevance of \\"Chvez Ravine\\".    <br /> <br />On June 23, 2005, a narrow majority of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of \\"Kelo v. City of New London, Conn.\\" local government can condemn private residential property for the purpose of forcing its sale to another private interest.  The Court majority declined to \\"second-guess\\" local governments in their use of eminent domain to promote \\"economic development.\\"   Local governments no longer will have to demonstrate that a neighborhood is \\"blighted\\" as LA did to the barrios.  Now every homeowner in America faces the potential prospect of going the way of Chvez Ravine, should some developer convince your city council he can bring in more revenue.  Ry Cooder himself has been following the case, noting that \\"poor people are the ones who get moved around\\" (see the June 23 Christian Science Monitor).     <br /> <br />For another journey to a community lost to the schemes of out-of-control government, look for David Kramer's musical tributes to District Six, the racially-mixed Cape Town neighborhood knocked down by the apartheid regime in 1966 under the Group Areas Act.

1573223026|1.0|Since the excellent \\"High Fidelity\\", Hornby's books have become less and less coherent, a progression that now give us \\"A Long Way Down\\", a book that is a total mess.  <br />The four central characters take it turns to narrate, which quickly becomes a tiresome device. The impression is that he struggled to come up with one well-crafted character, so gave us 4 mediocre unconvincing ones instead.  <br />The book's second big problem is that the plot goes absolutely nowhere, which makes the reading experience ultimately unsatisfying.
B0008GNJZY|4.0|Samuel L. Jackson plays this want to be god Coach Carter. I mean who do he think he is canceling basket ball games just because his students grades are not doing to well. Basket ball is what will give them a future in the NBA. What is sad about it is this movie is base on a true story.
B000957O7S|3.0|Hitch is about a love doctor (Will Smith) who helps geeks get the girl. He's smooth and cool and Smith plays him well. However him working as a love doctor only gets interesting when Kevin James' (The King of Queens) character is introduced. That's when you get all the laughs and when the movie comes to life. He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women. So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool. Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most. The Smith story just isn't as good alone  without James so thank god for him. Don't get me wrong the Smith scenes where he's trying to get a girl but keeps messing up are pretty funny. James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen. He's great in the King of Queens but also shows here that he could have a bright movie career. Him teaming up with the Rock could make a pretty entertaining movie.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I'm a special child because I like movies that others don't. Well, I watched this one at an advanced screening a while back but unfortunately missed the first 15 minutes. So, I missed the exorcism scene which is a shame. Well, you know what this means, I'm going to have to get this one once it's out on DVD. But that's not all, it's actually a good movie. It was confusing at times but I think that this movie is deeper than most say. The movie is about John Constantine, a man that can see dead people that walk on earth. He thus has to take them back to hell where they belong. The beautiful Rachel Weisz co stars also as someone who believes that the \\"suicide\\" of her sister isn't a suicide. The way that Constantine travels to Hell is really neat and original and the fight scenes are really neat, as he has some really cool weapons. The bible is also referenced in the movie but this isn't the same bible. This one has a \\"deleted\\" section where it speaks about the son of the devil. The movie is very original and neat and if you ignore some very confusing moments, you'll like it. But, no one else did, so I guess I'm a SPECIAL CHILD! I'm the same guy though that dissliked Scarface and Taxi Driver, so you kmow.. <br /> <br />I also found something very neat about this movie. At the death of the devil's son, I noticed that he posed no resistance and just died. So, I saw in a weird way a parallel between Jesus and him as they both went down without resistance to accomplish a mission. Anyway, if you are religious, you might notice this like I did, and there are some other religious moments. That's what I think about a movie that very few people like.
B000777J2S|5.0|the only negative criticism of this album that I've heard is that it's slow and by proxy dull. well, that's not quite true but it's not quite wrong either. A beautiful album true, but one that you have to cozy up to. Those out there who would like to believe (or have you believe) that they heard this and immediately found themselves entranced lie, otherwise Lou Reed's The Raven double disc would have sold millions upon millions.<br /><br />don't be afraid to love this record. i listen to it in the morning with my cat still asleep on my chest. this works for me, but to feel the power of Anthony's voice you need some quality time with it. The album opener \\"Hope there's someone\\" should be sung in cathedrals. \\"For today I am a boy\\" is more than inner voice anthem it's sombre tone transforms it into a song of pure joyfulness. \\"You are my sister\\" should find itself into every indie movie soundtrack wherein a female no-love-interest character dies.<br /><br />Regardless, nothing is more full of grace than this record. Grace of voice, so well trained and certain you cannot help but listen and not just hear.
0780021150|5.0|M is the movie from which crime movies flow. <br /> <br />In watching it you will notice the many motifs that, like Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" long ago became the scenes which were stolen, the ideas \\"borrowed\\", the concepts that inspired many of the films since the time of its release. What a show!
B00003CXFV|5.0|Loved it - features the best performance from an actress to date this decade. Julia Roberts was pitch perfect. Albert Finney deserved his accolades as well. I would have given it the best picture Oscar in 2000. Julia Roberts is always a joy to watch.
B0009I7NOO|5.0|I must admit that I am going through a phase of Oasis-mania right now brought on by my recent attendance of their gig in Detroit last weekend. But I dug this CD the day I bought it (one day after its release) and it has only grown more dear and essential to me as I've given it multiple and closer listens ever since.  <br /> <br />Is this the disc that's going to restore Oasis to the world-dominating (morning) glory they enjoyed in the mid-90's? No, times have changed and more importantly, many of today's music listeners don't have much appreciation for the rock style that Oasis specializes in. But I would dare say that this is a must-buy album for anyone who still cares for the sound of majestic guitars, anthemic choruses and the bigger-than-life persona that epitomized rock and roll in its heyday. This ought to be a more popular (sales-wise) album than it will probably turn out to be, because Oasis won't get the record company hype to push it to million-seller status and a lot of the youngsters who might normally dig this band are getting bland corporate rock like Three Doors Down and Nickelback shoved in their face instead. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are \\"Turn Up the Sun,\\" \\"Lyla,\\" \\"Keep The Dream Alive,\\" and \\"Let There Be Love.\\" But \\"A Bell Will Ring,\\" \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" and \\"Love Like a Bomb\\" also stick with me. And the other songs are worthwhile too - they're all strong cuts, actually, worthy of inclusion. This sounds like a band that had a lot of solid material to choose from and I would say they chose wisely.  <br /> <br />Basically, if you are an fan of large-scale, audience pleasing and accessible rock music created with intelligence, performed with skill and created with careful but gritty professionalism, there's no excuse for you not buying this CD! I recommend the dual disc over the regular CD because it's compatible with all the devices I've tried it with, and the videos are better to watch on your TV than on your computer.
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton does what many have failed - he explains his science in understandable, human terms. As a person who has worked with both empirical science, and intuitive understanding for many years, with great results, this explanation finally allows me to point to a book and say &quot;Yes, that's what I meant.&quot; Thanks, Bruce, and keep up the great work.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP from Eminem certainly took America by storm and has lasting power as most rap fans have this CD in their collection, and if they don't, theyve no idea what they're missing. Eminem has very dark but on point lyrics that pack a wallop with every listen, and shows how he just doesn't hold back from whatever's on his mind. Lyrically Eminem is very gifted and has a nack for writing catchy and memorable songs that stick with you which is the mark of a great artist. Despite the skeptisism Eminem showed that it doesn't really matter if you are white OR black as long as you can control the mic. <br /> <br />1. PSA 2000 - N/A <br />2. Kill You - 10/10 - This songs shows the anger and hatred Eminem has for everyone ranging from his parents to homosexuals to women and to radio stations. This is what I mean by 'Dark'. <br />3. Stan - 10/10 - This is a classic track that shows Eminems true ability for penning classics. He displays the thoughts and feelings of a very 'on edge' fan of him in a very clever fashion, which makes this a standout track. <br />4. Paul - N/A <br />5. Who Knew - 10/10 - This song has a very ominous message to parents who blame the actions of their children on entertainers in the music industry and who dont take responsibility for they're parenting. Another standout. <br />6. Steve Berman - N/A <br />7. The Way I Am - 10/10 - This song really shows Eminems built up anger about his fame and personality. This is definately a classic song and shouldn't be slept on. <br />8. The Real Slim Shady - 8/10 - Most of you would probably agree with me saying that this song doesn't really fit the albums theme. Although saying that some of the lyrics are the catchiest on the CD, but it bores me because it was so overplayed. <br />9. Remember Me? - 9/10 - I was close to giving this song 10 out of 10 but the guest appearences really let down the song. If only Em handled the whole track to himself I would have gave it 10, because his verse was a realstandout. Godd nevertheless. <br />10. I'm Back - 10/10 - Another classic song that shows Em's sense of humour towards critics, and also indulges in drugs and violence. This is one of Ems best songs. Period. <br />11. Marshall Mathers - 10/10 - This shows his hatred once more where he raps about the deaths of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G., The music industry, His mother and homosexuals... again. This is ANOTHER classic track which shouldn't go un-noticed. <br />12. Ken Kaniff - This is a waste of time and completely disgusting. SKIP!! <br />13. Drug Ballad - 9/10 - This shows Em speed rapping about erm... drugs, as the name of the song implies. This isn't exactly a standout track but really good overall. <br />14. Amityville - 10/10 - This shows the 'Darkness' of the album once again, where him and Bizarre of D-12 talk about the harsh realities of Detroit and how they are 'mentally ill from Amityville!'. This is quite a standout track, not a classic by any means but still very good. <br />15. Bitch Please II - 10/10 - Classic track with Dre, Snoop, Xzibit and Nate Dogg. This has one of the best beats on the album and very good lyrics especially from Em and Xzibit. This is another standout track and should NEVER be slept on. <br />16. Kim - 10/10 - This is probably the darkest song Em has ever written where he comentates the murder of his wife Kim. Very Dark but creative, lol. Chorus is very catchy and the beat is very effective with the style of Ems rhymes. Definately a standout track that shouldnt be played if your under 16 and your parents are around. <br />17. Under The Influence - 10/10 - Classic track with Em and all of D-12 rappin about drugs and alcohol. The lyrics are very witty and clever which make you want to hear it again and again. Another standout with a very catchy beat. <br />18. Criminal - 10/10 - ANOTHER classic song where Eminem tries to address freedom of speech and that its only music that he is performing, not multiple crimes. He's basically saying that no one should be affected by what he is saying as its only music. Definately a standout track. <br /> <br />This album really showed Eminem in his prime where he shows his anger, hate, frustration and sense of humour. I don't think Em couldve done a better job with this record, and its a shame he'll never top this. But this is a modern day classic and shouldn't be slept on as it is one of the most creative albums in years and shows Eminems true talents. <br /> <br />

B000002O5L|5.0|FULL MOON FEVER is Tom Petty's first solo album- and it's great! Granted, \\"Free Fallin'\\" is a bit overplayed, but there are many other wonderful songs here. \\"I Won't Back Down\\" is a statement of determination to stand up for one's beliefs and not take any crap from anyone; \\"Love Is A Long Road\\" is about what romance means for adults, which is that nothing is perfect all the time; \\"A Face In The Crowd\\" describes the feeling of not quite fitting in; and \\"I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\\" is a great Byrds cover. The fact that Petty advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist proves that he's a great human being as well as a great artist, yet another reason to own FULL MOON FEVER in any format.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This show is not only the best new show on television but I would rank it in the top 5 shows on television period. All the check boxes are ticked. Great Cast. Check. Great Writing. Check. Great Direction. Check. Even a great soundtrack. This show has no faults except for being on the wrong network (UPN). Veronica Mars (played brilliantly by Kristen Bell) is a teenage girl who has had to grow up overnight following the death of her best friend, her father (played by Enrico Colantoni) being fired and publicly falling from grace, her mother seemingly abandoning them and her ex-communication from the in-crowd. While trying to solve the mysteries of her best friend's death and her mother's disappearance, Veronica maintains a heavy class load while being a sleuth-in-training in her Dad's private investigation firm. In each episode of the first season we follow Veronica as she unearths clues for the major mysteries in her life as well as the Mysteries of the Week. In several episodes Veronica is seen juggling several cases at once and the audience is left breathless on the edge of their seats. It's a great show and should not be missed.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Often dismissed as lightweight, Pet Shop Boys' music remains entrancing.  Their brand of synth sounds combined pulsing beats and witty edgy lyrics to produce an enduring mix.  They subsequently worked with other artists such as Liza Minnelli on her \\"Results\\" CD.  Paul Anka's jazz swing reading of \\"It's A Sin\\" on his new \\"Rock Swings\\" CD encouraged me to delve back in for the originals.  \\"Everything I've ever done, Everything I ever do, Everyplace I've ever been, Everywhere I'm going to, it's a sin,\\" they sing on the throbbing classic with its relentless beat.  \\"West End Girls\\" has an amazing build from the throbbing bass and the airy chorus and still sounds fresh.  \\"Rent\\" has that happy light beat with a darker lyrical edge, \\"You dress me up, I'm your puppet; You buy me things, I love it; You bring me food, I need it; You give me love, I feed it.\\"  \\"Heart\\" is a romantic gem with its pulsing rhythm, \\"I'm in love with you, I mean what I say.\\"  On U2's \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" the boys create a sonic synth wall with their airy vocals mixed low.  It's an original treatment of this excellent song, weaving in snatches of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" that was done by the Four Seasons.  \\"Discography\\" is an excellent collection.  Enjoy!
6304698526|4.0|I would be tempted to give a five star rating to this fast moving 60s offering but not for the acting alone. The location is probably what sets this film apart from the ordinary coupled with Mcqueen at his coolest and at the top of his all to short career. There are not many films set in this city that have ended up lemons. It would be a pity if all this movie was remembered for was the sight of Mcqueen propelling a 67 GT Mustang around the streets of San Fransisco as there is much to like both in the story line generally and the adequate and sometimes brilliant casting.Don Gordon gives a standout performance as does Robert Vaughn who seldom failed to give of his undoubted best certainly during the 60s. A very watchable film for many reasons.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The musicians in this performance are absolutely at their best on this night. So much love is shared-George would be so proud. I tear up almost every time this show gets close to finishing. The build up of emotion is so amazing, by the end you realize how great this show really was, and that it will never happen again. Thanks to DVD it can happen as often as you like. About as perfectly done a show as I've ever seen. The sound quality is unsurpassed. The editing makes you feel you are there. Will be the jewel in your concert DVD collection.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman Begins was for me quite an enjoyment to behold. It was well made and actually had some depth. However ever since the previews I felt something lacking. I wasn't all too excited by the preview as I had expected to be. This feeling somehow extended to the film. I recall as a kid being overwhelmed when I saw the preview for the original and I was not let down in the least. For me a comparison between Burton's vision and Nolan's is unavoidable. I know they are two completely different realms but I can't help but be saddened by the disappearance of the franchise Tim Burton was creating. And I can't help but reflect on how much more I connected with the original version than this one. I don't completely blame Nolan for not being able to rival something so rare and phenomenal but I still feel he could have done something towards that old feeling at least a bit more without it necessarily feeling recycled. I prefer almost everything about the original: the city, the villain, the hero, the girlfriend, the visionary artistry, the extravagant shots, the 40's era and gothic style, the perfect climax, the mystery and the ridiculously abstract and flamboyant quality it exuded. I truly feel that soo many people are just jumping the gun and calling this the best Batman and placing it over the original which to me is utterly insane. I don't feel that many of these people are really thinking. I know that Burton took artistic liscence with his version but in doing so I feel that he only created a legacy, a phenomena of dark beauty never before seen and that will sadly never likely be seen again. I suppose strictly following the comics is not as important to me as presenting it in a creative, appealing fashion. If  Nolan were to present something actually as revolutionary as Burton's Batman than my hat would be off to him. These heights I did not feel were reached and I accept that because to me such an achievement would be close to impossible. I have tremendous respect for Baleas an actor. He proved himself to me even more so to be a serious and devoted actor with what he did with the Machinist and then half a year later playing Batman. And I knew all along he would be a good Bruce Wayne and Batman. I still however prefer Keaton's dark grittiness and quick movements while in the suit. His face fit so perfectly behind that mask that he seemed born for it. I also like how Keaton's Bruce Wayne seemed like an ineffectual panzi whose alter ego is a seemingly superhuman hero. But I must say there were times when Bale really did shine in the new suit. And yes he fits this Bruce Wayne very well. I always found him to be an admirable actor and especially after witnessing his version of Patrick Bateman I knew this guy was heading places. I was also not surprised by the charm Cillian Murphy threw into the mix as the Scarecrow. His performance somehow gave me a slight nostalgic feel that I might be able to connect to the original yet remains rather mild when Nicholson comes to mind, though I question whether something so extreme and over the top could even begin to fit in a film like this anyways. It seems that the one thing I really can give Nolan credit for is breathing some new life back into the series after being destroyed by you know who. Batman Begins did have its powerful somewhat magical moments. But at no time does it come anywhere close to expressing the indescribable magic of the original and in this regard is just kind of empty in comparison. But when I look at it on a different level perhaps comparison is not the best thing to dwell on. Batman Begins has done somthing completely orginal by giving Batman more meaning, seriousness, drive and depth than before. So in this regard I cannot look down on it too much at all for not delving into Burton's realm which is more placed in the realm of fantasy. And to me it makes sense why many hold this one higher than Burton's, mainly because a lot of people look down on fantasy. I on the other hand have quite an interest in the subject of fairytale and fantasy and have researched many of its facets and origins and have never failed to be amazed by any of it. Surprisingly the mythical aspect of the hero works out in both Nolan's realism and Burton's fantasy which is quite interesting. Which brings me to point out that a new quality that impressed me with Batman Begins is how the main character's journey actually reaches a somewhat spiritual level. I am not too disappointed with the new take on Batman and the direction it is now going in but it will not diminish the sadness I feel for what could have been after Batman Returns. They spent soo much time building up Catwoman's character to obviously bring her back and who knows what kind of magic was yet to come. One thing I can't fathom is how Nolan thinks he can pull off bringing the Joker back. To imagine anyone who isn't going to pale in comparison to Nicholson is pretty far fetched. I am never the less very curoius to see where Nolan is going to take the series from here.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Every 5-10 years an incredible new band will emerge on the scene and redefine music.   <br /> <br />System of a down combines two elements of music that I love. Hard fast and crazy and a fistfull of melody.  In my cd collection, I have everything from the beatles to slayer.  System of a Down is one of the few bands that can combine the speed of slayer, with the melodies of the beatles. <br /> <br />There is not a single song on this album that I don't like.  In my opinion, all of them are potential singles for the radio.   <br /> <br />I really doubted that I would like the new album better than toxicity.  I did not believe that they could actually make a better album.   <br /> <br />The rumor I've heard is that Hypnotize is even better than mezmerize.   <br /> <br />If you like melody and metal than this album is for you.  Can't wait to see them play in Baltimore in August.
0553573403|5.0|This is the first five star rating I have given since coming to Amazon.  It is once in a very long while that you will come across a novel where an author is able to meld a story so broad of scope and interesting to read that hour after hour will slip by unnoticed as you turn the pages.  A Game of Thrones is one of these books.  If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and believe yourself able to handle realistic depictions of life in a medieval world (blood, gore, profanity and sexual situations included) then I strongly believe you would enjoy reading this series.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This CD is a good, and different CD. <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is a NIN masterpiece that every fan should buy. There is more guitar, and singing in this CD unlike previous NIN CD's. <br />It is still very like the old NIN stuff, however, NIN have leaned a little away from industrial rock. <br />This CD will satisfy new comers to NIN, as well as oldschool fans. <br />Since the release of this album i have purchased all the previous nin CD's, and i love this band. <br />\\"With teeth\\" got me started on nine inch nails. <br />It is very catchy, and you will listen to it over and over again.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold have once again topped the standards they had once established. Like most fans, I didn't think they could make an album better than Waking The Fallen which was in my opinion phenomenal. A7X are back with a very metal sounding album with punk, hardcore, and even latino influences. Could this get any better? I do miss Shadows' screams, but this album truly shows his talent as a singer. <br />1. The Beast and the Harlot:  Great opener. The drumming couldn't get any better and the main guitar riff is awesome. Very catchy chorus, great drum and guitar solo.  10/10<br />2. Burn it Down:  Great vocals on this one. I love the way the drum beats are always different but somehow all fit together. The intro melody is great too. 10/10<br />3. Blinded in Chains:  Another awesome song. Reminds me of Waking the Fallen. Great chorus. Amazing mini drum solo at 2:50. 9/10<br />4. Bat Country:  Surely the easiest song from the album to put on air. Very catchy chorus, great harmonies in the middle of the song. It is a bit pop-sounding but will make a great first single.   8/10<br />5. Trashed and Scattered:  Very punk-influenced. Great vocal harmonies in the end. 9/10<br />6. Seize the Day:  I was hoping for another ballad from A7X. And this is it. We feel the passion in Shadows voice again in this song. The guitar solo says it all...10/10<br />7. Sidewinder:  I never thought we could turn from metal to latino in just one song. But A7X did it and it couldn't sound any better. The outro is simply amazing. 10/10<br />8. The Wicked End:  This is about the only time on the album where we can actually hear and feel the bass guitar. Another awesomely built song. The bridge with the choir is unbelievable. The imagery of the lyrics; awesome. Such passion. This is the wicked end, for sure. 10/10<br />9. Strength of the World:  Amazing intro. Reminds me of Wherever I May Roam by Metallica. Such a great build-up. The rest of the song is a bit disappoingting though. But then again...the outro is so powerful...7/10<br />10. Betrayed: Great all-around song. Amazing intro riff. 10/10<br />11. M.I.A.: This is probably the song that was the hardest to get used to. It has become one of my favorite song now. There are many ways to interpret this song but the most obvious theme is war. &quot;To challenge me you must be strong&quot; Shadows shouts. Great guitar solos and lyrics. The outro is powerful. Such a shattered but proud voice. 10/10<br />As I said many times, incredible album. Avenged Sevenfold have once again surpassed the capabilities. Their musicianship has incredibly improved. Sadly the bass guitar seems to be left out on this album. But even then, a very worthy buy.
B000957O82|3.0|What you are about to see in no way resembles real life.  There is no date doctor that will cut down the boundaries between two people to get them to meet up.  There is no way a beautiful and famous movie star would hook up with an unemployed accountant the way they did in the movie.  And when it comes to dialogue, people just don't talk the way they did in this movie.  So, if you are going to see this movie, please understand that reality is not reflected at all in this movie. <br /> <br />But if you would like a silly and cute romantic comedy, then you might want to check this out.... at a video store.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because I think watching it once will be enough. <br /> <br />But I do have a bone to pick with the humor of this movie.  Every single funny part of this movie was shown in the previews.  There was nothing really funny that I hadn't seen before watching the movie.  All that was left was the kind of funny parts. <br /> <br />And, let's be honest, if this movie did not have Will Smith and Kevin James then it would have been a complete dud.  Why?  Because they are fantastic. <br /> <br />First, Will Smith.  I've always loved Will Smith.  He has a charisma that carries naturally on the screen and I look forward to every movie he is in (okay, I haven't caught \\"Ali\\" yet).  Though he plays the same character in every movie (goofy, funny, full of energy, and loveable) he is still a character that I can't get enough of.  And he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  For a first venture into a romantic comedy I think he did well with the script provided him. <br /> <br />And then Kevin James.  I haven't watched his show \\"King of Queens\\" and I don't know of any movie he has done, but I really hope to see more of Kevin James.  He did his role well and I couldn't think of anybody else that could have played that part better.  Kevin James nailed his character perfectly.  I see a great star rising. <br /> <br />So, who should see this?  Well, anybody who likes a decent romantic comedy or even a regular comedy should watch it once.  Rent it, don't buy.  Only people who rushed to the theaters and still love it would want this in their collection.
B000002ADT|3.0|Ok Ok I can already see the angry looks on people's faces with the ululations of \\"How can he have the gall and audacity to not say that this is a perfect record?\\"  <br /> <br />Well, quite easily actually.  <br /> <br />You see the thing is, I will say that the hooks here are absolutely awesome. I will say that every musician EXCEPT for Miles is mind blowing.  <br /> <br />However, if the musicianship of the performer who \\"made\\" the album is not that great after the hooks, well then the whole album is not that great. <br /> <br />I know the blasphemy of me even suggesting that Miles' musicianship was not awesome is frightening but it is true!!!!!! <br /> <br />The whole album is predictable and repetitive in his style with each solo starting out very deliberately and then a few notes in goes to a squeeling high pitched wail that sounds less pleasant than a herd of cattle being slaughtered at once. Or, he has a mute and plays a 4/4 solo the whole time with each one using the same arpeggios. Mpreover, each solo highlights his lack of technical proficiency.  <br /> <br />Now, if you can disregard this and listen to the other musicians, which is well worth it, you will enjoy this album like nothing else. But, it is a Miles Davis album, so the fact that Miles contributes almost no positive qualities to the album drags its quality down quite a bit.
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|This movie is someplace in my top 5 all time.  That said, this DVD is certainly not worth buying to replace the one probably sitting in your collection already.   I've given it 3 stars because it gets the one by default for the great movie it is, another for the digital remastering efforts, and an extra one for the lone good feature it has salvaged (keep reading).    The Bad:  There is no director or DeNiro real-time commentary track -- which alone would have been worth any price; in its place, there are what the marketing department has coined \\"moments with Martin Scoresese [et al]...\\" where he, some cast, and some crew are heard briefly discussing scenes and trivia of interest. If you play the DVD with these audio \\"moments\\" on, then it appears that Marty, Sharon, Nicholas, the editor and the costume designer (yeah, that's right, costume designer!) are offering commentary while they too watch the film.  Actually, it's a track that's essentially a bunch of interviews spliced together in an attempt to match the film's progression.  This is made evident once you watch the other features because as it were, the features are themselves just the video representation from the audio portion of the \\"moments\\".      What's even more frustrating (once you figure out that you don't care about finding 1970esque shirt collars) is the neutral voice that introduces who's about to talk EVERY TIME they switch audio narrative.  And let me tell you, it's usually Sharon Stone -- who doesn't exactly come across as the bolt of lightening she managed originally to trap as an actress this one time in her career.  She goes on and on and on, not really saying anything, fawning over DeNiro and Scorsese and Woods, and never telling you anything you didn't know -- other than confirm just how insecure an actress she was at the time, and likely continues to be.      The Good:  The History Channel documentary featuring Nicholas Pilleggi offers the most insight -- including real interviews with Ace,and great footage of the other characters (including Tony Spilotro -- Joe Pesci's character).  Even if the re-enactments are cheesy, the information is valuable.  Problem I see with this is that this material was already out there, and was available for purchase from the H-channel website well before this DVD came out.      All in all, save your money unless 1) your DVD player can make the most of the digitally remastered picture and 2) you have a good enough eye to notice.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This was an easy 5 star rank for me.  I love WWII movies, but for every great one made, there are two that are tasteless or cheesy.  This is by far the best depiction of what it must have been like on the frontlines in WWII.  The interviews at the beginning of each episode with the actual men that the series follows was a beautiful touch.  Don't be surprised if you catch yourself with tears welling up in your eyes.    Aside from being historically accurate, the 10 episodes have amazing cinematography.  The script lacks that overused American bravado that seems universal in any war movie with American forces in it.  Just ordinary guys who did extraordinary feats.    If you are into movies like Saving Private Ryan (which I thought was poor), or god forbid...Rambo...you will probably not enjoy this collection.  However, if you want a realistic and powerful depiction of those unsung heroes of WWII that will leave you with a lump in your throat after each episode...this is it.    I'll be watching this collection twice per year for the rest of my life.  Definitely worth the original retail price...and now with such a discount...what an easy buy.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|In Return to Oz (a version that may be a bit too scary for young children) Auntie Em sends Dorothy to a sanitarium where hopefully she will clear her head from all of the \\"Oz nonsense.\\" This doesn't work, for soon Dorothy manages to return to Oz, but things have definitely changed. She finds her old friends turned to stone and discovers that an awful Nome king has taken over Oz. <br />A dark fantasy-adventure, Return to Oz follows in the tone of the original L. Frank Baum books, Ozma of Oz and Land of Oz, rather than posing as a sequel to the classic of all family films, The Wizard of Oz. While seeming pretty creepy for younger viewers, older audiences may just be disturbed at the faded post-apocalyptic settings and bleak story when compared to the cheery and bright Technicolor of the 1939 Judy Garland Hollywood version. Opting for depressing and evil characters in lieu of the beloved simple types of the first is only one example of how a comparison puts this new version at a disadvantage. However, Return to Oz is stylistically compelling, doing its best to cinematically render Baum's original character drawings of the Tin Man and the Scarecrow. Will Vinton (creator of the stop-motion California Raisins) did some award-winning work on some of the creatures and special effects. By avoiding the musical genre trappings and casting a Dorothy (Fairuza Balk, in her first screen role) of actual kid age, it doesn't seem to patronize the youth audience with sugar-coated moralizing. Not known for his work in family entertainment anyway, writer/director Walter Murch previously worked as an editor and sound designer for Apocalypse Now and The Godfather. By offering a family-friendly way into a nightmare fantasy.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0316172324|4.0|This is a book about snap judgments, decisions we make in the blink of an eye.  It starts with wonderful examples, but it ends with the far more numerous disasters.  If anything, Gladwell is too generous. Snap judgments are familiar to all of us. They are often at the beginning of some sequence of events we have regretted for years.  Gladwell suggests we take new interest in this dangerous decision making strategy.  Therefore, be warned.  This book can be dangerous to your health!<br /><br />The book is an extended collection of magazine articles and seems to skip from topic to topic.  The journey can be engaging, but the 'grand' theme gets obscured.  Fortunately, the book is a quick read.  Unfortunately, it doesn't cover anything in much depth.  The most glaring omission is any differentiation of neural activity in the enteric (gut), limbic (lizard brain) and neocortex (mammal brain).  But, it isn't necessary to know these neural mechanics to get something from the book and that is why many intellectuals will hate it.<br /><br />Gladwell suggest the odd notion that thinking in words can be counter productive to good decision making.  The argument has obvious merit to the pragmatist, but telling someone 'in words' to 'avoid words' is somewhat paradoxical and will cause the word academic intellectual much distress.  To make sense of this, Gladwell is advising a balance of word and action (rehearse, rehearse, rehearse).  But, how do you get the reality of this across in words.  Gladwell doesn't investigate this conundrum.<br /><br />Additionally, several arguments will upset the intellectual reader's sense of propriety.  First, Gladwell has the temerity to link genetics and intelligence.  Actually, Gladwell is smart enough to avoid the direct argument, but he does present an alias: genetics provide us with snap decision making skills, some people have better starter set than others.  For many academics, this is proof Gladwell should be sent to the gulag.<br /><br />It is tempting to dismiss the importance of snap decisions since the 'really important' decision must be reviewed and people have been arguing over how to decide things since time immemorial.  Don't take that escape route.  Consider the autistic individual, someone who has no social timing and cannot successfully decide what to focus upon.  This person will often never learn to speak.  The ability to make snap decisions is critical for simply existing as part of society. Understanding the process is central to assisting those who have difficulty joining us.<br /><br />Here is an outline of Gladwell's argument:<br /><br />1. The best decisions are snap decisions:  Gladwell has lots of examples demonstrating the idea that 2 seconds is about one we need:<br /><br />a) Reading faces in such a way it seem you can read minds (hint: Look for defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt)<br /><br />b) Saving museums from fraudsters.<br /><br />c) Winning wars<br /><br />d) Gambling to win<br /><br />2. Words are the enemy of good snap decision makers:<br /><br />a) gamblers in tests figured out stats for winning before they could 'tell' someone the rules<br /><br />b) sports greats don't know what they do that makes them win<br /><br />c) It is easy to unconsciously prime someone to act as you wish them to act<br /><br />d) The ventromedial prefontal cortex makes the decision and you can't control it<br /><br />e) We seem to have (at least)  two minds, conscious and unconscious. both are always working to find  answers, sometimes the conscious listens to the unconscious, sometimes it doesn't. Use of the 'conscious' mind can overshadow and supress the 'unconscious'<br /><br />3. Your starter set of 'snap decisions' will remind you of a 5 year old<br /><br />a) We cannot help but be attracted to tall dark handsome archetypes, so we elect empty suits<br /><br />b) Clinical tests prove almost everyone's snap decisions tend toward race and gender bigotry.<br /><br />4. But,don't give up.  Some have snap decision skills that can be developed:<br /><br />a) Learn the rules<br /><br />b) Practice the skills,<br /><br />c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy)<br /><br />5. Roadblocks to training (1): verbal overshadowing:<br /><br />The left hemisphere thinks in words and the right hemisphere thinks in pictures. If you happen to watch a bank robbery, then describe the event in words, something happens. The words displace your visual memory and you can't identify the robber in a lineup. In another study, people who were asked to write about their thoughts solved 30% fewer puzzles than the control group who were allowed to simply cogitate.  Avoid thinking in words, they will hide anything your gut might have to say on the matter. Intellectuals are not going to like this advice!<br /><br />Gladwell's solution: put the words in a decision tree so you preprogram the information search to allow your gut a chance to get involved. (see cardiac arrest decision tree)<br /><br />6. Key roadblocks to training (2): misguided simulations<br /><br />a) Bad market surveys<br /><br />b) Bad military simulations<br /><br />Solution: Knowing how people make decisions is more important than any single fact or opinion.  (Gladwell is very brief here)<br /><br />7. Key roadblocks to training (3): stay in the zone (manage your body to insure you can think)<br /><br />The archetypal 'blink' disaster is a police shooting some innocent man.  Gladwell connects the high speed chase and group dynamics of the cop-car with the disaster.  The high speed chase put the body with adrenaline, thus predisposing the policeman to use the reactions of a 5 year old. In particular, a cop with elevated heart rate and lots of adrenaline cannot read faces as well as the calm cop might do.  Much of face reading is timing (something autistics lack) and in their 'rush' of the chase, cops will operate like autistics.  The group dynamics provide a false sense of 'order' since everyone in a chase is basically 'out of the minds'.  The solution is self-management.  Keep the heart rate low, don't rely on others, fall back on rehearsed responses.sion skills that can be developed: <br />a) Learn the rules <br />b) Practice the skills,  <br />c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy) <br /> <br />5.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Truly Norah Jones is one of the best things to happen in music and album deserves every bit of the credit it has gotten yet. Every song is absolutely exceptional and original (even classics such as the Nearness of You) and makes you feel really good. This is great music no matter where you are.
B000007MVD|5.0|These two discs feature live-in-the-studio recordings made by The Beatles for BBC Radio between 1962 and 1965.   Over half of these 56 songs are covers, many of which were never officially released, and it's a real treat to have this often-bootlegged material available and generally sounding very good. And the lavish 46-page booklet features complete recording information, pictures, and essays by Derek Taylor and producer Kevin Howlett.    The Beatles do their best to live up to their happy-go-lucky images on a number of non-musical \\"soundbytes\\", and Paul McCartney gets to sing a couple of too-cute pop songs, but the majority of this material is simply magnificent. John Lennon sings a tough rock n' roll-rendition of Ray Charles' \\"I Got A Woman\\", McCartney rips loose on electrifying versions of \\"Lucille\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and George Harrison does a credible Chuck Berry on \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\".  A couple of Arthur Alexander-covers are equally great, and Lennon performs a wonderfully tough, confident reading of \\"A Shot Of Rhythm & Blues\\" and tears through a great, punchy \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\".    Their own songs sound magnificent as well. A driving \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", the clanging, circular guitar riff of \\"Ticket To Ride\\" ringing out...Well, you can check out the track list for youself.   This is a delightful 2hrs+ of music. The Beatles give it their all, and you can hear what a terrific little rock n' roll combo they were when they could actually hear each other playing!  Very highly recommended.
B0000069VC|5.0|I read a review a few beneath this one complaining about this dvd's aspect ratio.  Let's clear the record here.  This movie was actually SHOT as a Fullscreen picture. Am I talking crazy talk here?  Nope, I wish I was. <br />      When it was released in theaters they just croped it shot by shot to look as thought it was  formated for the theater screen.  Yes, it sucks. But hey, that's the way it is.  This is just one of those weird exceptions to the rule.  The ORIGINAL format IS Fullscreen.  The ALTERED format is Widescreen.  In other words, your better off getting the older version in Fullscreen than the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" in Bogus-Widescreen.  You will actually see the whole image in the Fullframe version!
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton has done a phenomenal job of putting into words what I have instinctively known about the power of thoughts and beliefs on my physical body all my life, - but haven't been able to find the words to explain.  He writes with a joy and passion, that makes turning the pages effortless. And the lighthearted way that he uses diagrams and tells his personal stories makes the difficult world of quantum physics palatable and easy to understand - I really enjoyed this book - highly recommended to anyone who wants to reclaim the power over their lives! <br />
B00008DDXC|3.0|Compared to the other two movies that have been released, this has to be the worst of them. It seems to just drag on for hours on end, and even though I enjoyed the book greatly, it was not my favorite movie. I cannot insult it too greatly as it is Harry Potter, a favorite of mine, but I will say, defintley not a purchase movie. This one's a rental.
1932100385|1.0|Just more vegan propaganda wrapped up to look like a legitimate study. Have you noticed how many of the usual culprits that are highly recommending this book have an vegetarian agenda? i.e. McDougall, Barnard, Ornish et al. What this book *can* teach you is that statistics can be presented in such a way as to prove most anything you want.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|This is not a music DVD.  It is a movie about stoned out rock stars.  I was very disappointed.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is what I've been waiting to hear from Dream Theater since they restated to their prog-metal mission in 1999: a collection of excellent songs. Where 2003's Train of Thought was straight-ahead metal, this one is far more varied. Don't get me wrong, I love to hear DT rock hard, fast and heavy, but not on every track. That's why Awake was always my favorite CD of theirs - it had both wonderfully heavy (\\"The Mirror\\") and ethereal (\\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\") moments. This CD follows a tried and true hard-soft-hard-soft array that keeps the album interesting listen after listen.  Highlights for me include \\"These Walls\\", \\"I Walk Beside You\\", and \\"Never Enough\\". There are plenty who will say \\"I Walk...\\" is too simplistic, catchy and radio-friendly, but after three unabashedly prog CDs it's nice to hear something commercially viable from these guys. And unlike the Desmond Child/\\"You Not Me\\" debacle, this time they did it on their own terms. They've spent eight years making up for 1997's mediocre Falling Into Infinity, and it's great to hear them settle down and just write good songs. The album has a cohesive flow (and a literal flow, with Jordan Rudess soundscapes connecting the tracks) and never tries too hard.<br /><br />The mark of a mature virtuoso is that he no longer needs to show off. This CD represents the culmination of Dream Theater's musical development.
B000002MZ9|4.0|Pearl Jam backing Neil Young, now there's an idea. Some people don't think this came off as good as it should have, but I don't think it could have been much better. I mean it sounds just like what it is, maybe it's not Neil singing \\"Even Flow\\", but it's still damn good. The whole thing is pretty consistent, but I really like \\"I'm The Ocean\\", \\"Truth Be Known\\", and the epic-ish \\"Scenery\\". Also extra good is \\"Downtown\\", the only hit from this, and \\"Peace And Love\\", the only track Vedder sings on. At the very least it's one of his better 90's albums. Now if we can just get Chris Cornell to front Crazy Horse.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|John Mellencamp is often called a poor man's Bruce Springsteen. In many ways he is, and that is not such a bad thing to be. Like the Boss, Mr. Mellencamp sings about personal experiences and tells tales of people struggling to get ahead in the world. Where Mr. Springsteen sings about Jersey & the East Coast, Mr. Mellencamp sings about his region of the country, Indiana & the Midwest. The Lonesome Jubilee is my favorite Mellencamp album and he expands on the musical stylings of his previous release, Scarecrow. He employs fiddles, accordians and mandolins to give the album a rustic, midwestern feel. \\"Paper In Fire\\" opens the album with a bang and then slides into \\"Down & Out In Paradise\\" which is a critical rocker about the state of the nation. \\"Cherry Bomb\\" is a great song about days gone by and is his \\"Glory Days\\". Like \\"Down & Out\\", the album makes many political statements with songs like \\"We Are The People\\", \\"Empty Hands\\", \\"Hard Times For An Honest Man\\" and \\"Hotdogs & Hamburgers\\". After the political heaviness, he closes the album out with the silly and fun \\"Rooty Toot Toot\\". John Mellencamp always has alot to say and on this album, he speaks from the heart and it makes for great music.  The bonus track is a strong number, \\"Blues From A Front Porch\\", but it would have een nice if they include the b-sides from the album's singles, the live version of \\"Check It Out\\", \\"Never To Old\\" (b-side of \\"Paper In Fire\\") and \\"Shama Lama Ding Dong\\" (b-side of \\"Cherry Bomb\\").
B00005B534|3.0|Stephen Forte's Adagio project begins with this album. The liner notes for this album state that Forte relentlessly studied and practiced the style of Ynjwie Malmsteen, and the similarity is evident. The band bears some resemblence to the more well-known Symphony X, but there are some differences. Adagio incorporates far more classical/baroque passages in their songs. Often these will even be played with a piano or harpsichord (or a keyboard that is emulating the sound). <br /> <br />There is something missing from this band, and I have a bit of difficulty placing it. Perhaps it needs a stronger emotional connection. Or perhaps it is that the emotional feel throughout the album is fairly constant, and there isn't enough variety. <br /> <br />There are some great songs here and some great parts of songs. The Stringless Violin is probably the best song on the album, featuring some beautiful piano work, remarkable chorus melody, and Forte also plays with some soul (I hate when guitar players only shred). <br /> <br />The talent here is undeniable. Just in his mid-twenties, Forte demonstrates a level of technical skill on the guitar, combined with some knowledge of when to show restraint (which I am sure he will learn more about as he grows older), that places him in the same calibre of much more famous guitarists like Yngwie. The other musicians also show their stuff fairly well. The drumming stands out, as do the powerful, rich vocals. <br /> <br />I would give this album a rating of 7.2/10. I translate this to a 3-star rating here (Worth having in your collection, but it won't be something you listen to all that often).
B0009IW9CK|5.0|Big Daddy finds John Cougar Mellencamp in a quiet, self-reflective mood. The album has a folk sound to it and although a few songs have electric guitars, it is mostly acoustic based. Songs like \\"Big Daddy Of Them all\\", \\"Void In My My Heart\\", \\"Mansions In Heaven\\", \\"Sometimes A Great Notion\\" and \\"JM's Questions\\" all deal with his family and his crumbling marriage. \\"Martha Say\\" is one of his most powerful songs and Lisa Gerimano's violin cuts through the songs. \\"Theo & Weird Harold\\" & \\"Jackie Brown\\" are like old Woody Guthrie Dust Bowl songs with their narrative tales. \\"Pop Singer\\" finds him railing against his early John Cougar image. The album closes out on an upbeat note with his raucous cover a 60's chestnut by The Hombres, Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out). Big Daddy is often overlooked, but it ranks right up there with any of his albums.  The bonus track is an acoustic version of \\"Jackie Brown\\" which was originally released as the b-side to the album version of the song.

B00002ZMNV|4.0|It didn't work for deep purple and for most, it was a huge surprise that it was a success for Metallica.  <br />---------------------------------------------------------------- <br />PROS <br /> <br />*The spectacle that it was to see 4 Metal gods backed up by a over 100 classical musicians was just incredible in itself. <br /> <br />*Some songs were made to be backed up by an orchestra. \\"Outlaw Torn\\", \\"Ktulu\\", \\"Bleeding Me\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"  were all amazing.  <br /> <br />*Metallica themselves were on top form and there wasn't one fault in their playing throughout the gig. <br /> <br />*2 new songs, \\"Minus Human\\" and \\"No Leaf Clover\\", were entered into the setlist. The never before heard material were nothing short of brilliant.  <br /> <br />*The Documentary in the Extras is quite enjoyable and interesting. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------- <br />CONS <br /> <br />*The choice of songs could've been better. No Fade To Black? Sanitarium? And yet they put in some songs with which the orchestra didn't adapt very well. Enter Sandman for example, was quite average. as was Sad But True and yet again, Not enough old stuff. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------- <br />All in all, A Successful outing by the 'Tallica boys and the mixing of genres did work overall. An interesting and enjoyable DVD that both classical and Mtal fans will enjoy.
B000002HEP|5.0|One of the primary stoner rock outfits of the '90s (along with Monster Magnet, Fu Manchu, and Electric Wizard) Kyuss just plain rule. While the airwaves were awash in grunge, flannel, and Gen-X angst, the team of John Garcia, Josh Homme, Brant Bjork, and Scott Reeder were taking a select few listeners on amps-cranked, weed-fueled metal sagas that would do Black Sabbath, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer proud while still crafting their own signature sound.<br /><br />Welcome To Sky Valley, the band's third release and positioned right after the unbelievably awesome Blues For The Red Sun, deserves to be regarded as a genre classic. While there's still plenty of woofer-crushing amplitude on this outing, the band were cranking down the heaviness a notch in favor of some rad psychedelic vibes (break out the wah-wah!). The whole album is basically a huge jam, divided arbitrarily into 3 tracks each about 14-18 minutes in length (each track has three or four subdivisions, as listed above). Garcia's gravelly vox, huge headbanging grooves, and a general loose, swingin' atmosphere prevail here. Imagine the band jamming out in the middle of the Mojave, amps plugged in, bowls loaded, a cooler full of six-packs...<br /><br />Most important of all, Welcome To Sky Valley probably best showcases the budding guitar genius of Josh Homme. From funky leads to crushing downtuned riffs to some surprisingly delicate and nuanced clean picking, Homme is a master. You can see mere glimmers of his massive talent in the later Queens Of The Stone Age, but in Kyuss he truly dominates.<br /><br />Welcome To Sky Valley, along with Blues For The Red Sun and ..And The Circus Leaves Town, are essential pillars of stoner rock. Tune in and drop out, my friends.<br /><br />P.S. And if you ever wanted to hear Kyuss take a stab at doo-wop, here's your chance! Keep listening after the third track.
B0002S94BG|5.0|Most artists out there work for years and years to create a special album. Jeff Buckley did it in his first studio release. This Legacy Edition does add to the overall value of the album.     It's such a shame that Forget Her was not included on the original release for personal reasons. Its a beautiful, heartbreaking piece of great music. Other tracks on CD2 are great, the covers are beautiful, some more experimental than others.    The DVD is OK, with Forget Her video interesting with some rare footage from Europe. The early videos are great to look at again. I would have wanted more interviews and info.     BUY IT!!
B000003493|5.0|If you believe rock and roll should be fun to listen to, rather than an obligation or a chore, you owe it to yourself to listen to this CD. <br /> <br />Rhino Records has a lot of different single CDs and boxed sets that carry the \\"Nuggets\\" title. Way back in the early 1970s, the \\"Nuggets\\" anthology was intended to collect songs recorded by the great mid-1960s American garage bands. This collection casts the net a bit wider, including songs by British Invasion protopunks like the Troggs, the underrated Aussie band the Easybeats, and the Monkees. All these songs were recorded by bands that simply didn't have very long recording lives, and the lion's share are one-hit wonders. <br /> <br />This is also one of the greatest rock and roll CDs of all time. <br /> <br />Bands like the Standells, the Count Five and the Chocolate Watchband may have tried their best to imitate the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, but ended up with a uniquely teenaged American identity of their own. Listening to this CD will take you back to a time before magazines like Rolling Stone existed, when no one in his right mind expected a rock star to have a serious opinion about politics, and when music was FUN rather than pretentious. All the songs here are short and performed passionately, no matter how primitive the musicians' abilities by today's standards. \\"Lies,\\" for example, is probably the best Beatles knockoff ever recorded because the Knickerbockers were clearly having the times of their lives pretending to be the Fab Four (even if they couldn't follow up with anything even remotely as good). In a sense, this is punk rock before its time, but these are punks that didn't want to change the world. They only wanted to play rock and roll music. And, luckily, there were enough small, local labels out there that this music could not only be recorded but be local hits.  <br /> <br />If you're tired of the bloated, formulaic, plodding music that passes for mainstream rock today, \\"Nuggets\\" provides the perfect antidote. There are several other volumes available, including boxed sets, but most of the cream of the crop are collected right here.

B0009Q0F5U|4.0|After enjoying the score for the Battlestar Galactica 2003 mini-series by Richard Gibbs (with Bear McCreary) I was keen to hear how they would continue with their brooding, minimalistic style in the series. Well, they stayed true to the same musical textures but built upon them with greater ethnic diversety and emotionally powerful score writing. <br />Most of this album from Series 1 is composed by Bear McCreary and he proves himself to be a truly gifted composer who is not limited to certain styles or genres but can draw upon cultral styles  <br />from accross the globe. From Taiko drums to middle-eastern woodwinds and even Irish pipes mixed with strings, electronica and even opera we are treated to a musical canvas that is multi-textured and often wonderfully entertaining and interesting. From quiet, introspective cues with minimal orchestration to grand string orchestras soaring with true classical grandios! Bear McCreary has created a truly wonderful soundscape for one of the best sci-fi series to come out in many years! I look forward to hearing his music for series 2 with great anticipation!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|First off I want to say that I find it rather funny to read through all of the reviews only to find that none of you people are even from OC!!!! How can you people even begin to talk about life in OC if you don't even live there??? Seriously people get over yourselves.... Life in the OC is pretty close to the show... if not the exact same as the show...  Of course the show mainly takes place in South OC where the \\"Rich Kids\\" live I am from North OC and it's pretty much the same just without a million rich kids... Either way life in the OC is awesome... This show is awesome and you people who sit there ranting and raving about how this person is fake or this part of the show doesn't seem like it deals with a relevant issue need to shut your mouths and wake up to the fact that IT'S A FREAKING TV SHOW!!!!!!! It's not like some MTV Real World show  so get a life and talk trash about your own stupid little cities problems and get off of mine!

I even ended up rebuying it 2 more times when mine disappeared or got scratched up too much from being listened to ALL the time on my portable CD player.  <br /> <br />Fallen is a GREAT CD. Many claim the songs sound similar to one another, which is true, but Amy's haunting voice and incredible lyrics keep the CD on the right track and make it a great listen over and over again. Amy Lee has to be one of my favorite female vocalists today despite the fact that she sounds like she moo's live. Her voice is haunting and has a hint of choral training-reminding me of Josh Groban. And her range is amazing, as seen on Whisper, Hello, and Imaginary. <br /> <br />1.) Going Under-5/5 I never get this sick of this song. The chorus is infectious and when she hits 'I'm dying again' it sounds amazing. <br />2.) Bring Me To Life-6/5 One of the best songs I have ever heard in my life. The beginning is amazing and draws me in every time. The lyrics are also amazing for this track. <br />3.) Everybody's Fool-4/5 I used to love this song, as did my mom, but it got played a lot and unlike the first two singles I had little patience after hearing it everytime I sat down in the car. <br />4.) My Immortal-3/5 This song is great, but I like the band version a LOT better and this song was WAY overplayed on our local radio station. <br />5.) Haunted-4/5 Creepy lyrics but none the less it sounds awesome all together. Her harmonies are beautiful. <br />6.) Tourniquet-6/5 This song has crazy lyrics-I love it. The very beginning sounds really cool when they edit her voice for \\"I tried to kill the pain but only brought more\\". <br />7.) Imaginary-5/5 Never thought a song about paper flowers would fly with me but after a while it soon became my favorite. And is it just me or is the middle violin section from M. Night Shamylan's 'The Village'? IDK I never saw that movie, only the trailers. XD <br />8.) Taking Over Me-6/5 I love the harmonies the best in this song.  <br />9.) Hello-3/5 Not my favorite but it's certainly grown on me. This one is a capella and a few high notes sound weird and out of place on this CD. <br />10.) My Last Breath-4/5 Probably one of the more mature songs on this CD. Good lyrics but not as catchy as the rest. <br />11.) Whisper-5/5 One of my favorites. The chorus is great but the very end creeps me out with the french chanting (I think it's french) <br />*12.) My Immortal (Band Version)-4/5 Added onto a later batch of CDs. This version is a LOT better in my opinion but because of the radio play it gets, I don't listen to it much. <br /> <br />You may notice that I didn't rate any under a 3 because I love this CD. It played non-stop in my CD player for around 8 months straight, the record for any of my CDs to date except for Kelly Clarkson. I'd recommend and do recommend this to anyone, it's worth the money. Everything from the vocals to the band fits together perfectly. This isn't something for self proclaimed 'hard rockers' but if you enjoy pop or alternative I'd definately suggest this. I can't wait to hear their second one.
B0002858YS|5.0|The best (punk)rock album to hit the shelves in '04!  This is superb!  They bring a new distorted yet extremely enjoyable sound to today's rock...   The beats are really catchy.   My favourite tracks were 'Change Your Mind'.. 'Somebody Told Me'(I had it on repeat and heard it like 25 times!!!) 'Mr. Brightside' (the video that introduced me to their music) and my personal favourite: 'Andy You're A Star'..   Takes a listen to get used to the style but great! Like bjrk and rock music.  A must buy for any alternative, punk, or rock fan...  \\"'Cause.. I'm mr. Brightside...!\\"
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|This album, quite simply, is crap.  It's boring and, at best, mediocre.  I tried and tried to get into this, not wanting to miss out on what was hailed as such a great disc.  But I just don't get it.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|<br />Every once in a bit, Britain produces a music god. Here's one! <br />EVERY song except 'Cheating on you' are way way way out! <br />Alternative indie rock at it's best!!! <br />Starts with Jacqueline... an amazing track that starts off slow and then gets beaty and catchy! <br />Now really, thank you England for some of the best music I've ever heard! If you like punkish indie rock you''re gonna love this album. Really every song is catchy and nice. <br />I cannot believe Franz Ferdinand opened for Interpol. Honestly I prefer Ferdinand.... and that's saying something since Interpol are so darned good. <br />
B0007VZ91C|5.0|Another beautiful offering from Deva Premal.  The songs flow together and build upon each other for an uplifting yoga and meditation session.  I had the pleasure of seeing her and Mitten at the Midwest Yoga Conference.  Her music is her meditation and is always an inspiration. My favorite is still the Essence so check that out as well!
B00005JNTX|5.0|I've surprised several people by telling them that I believe \\"Sin City\\" is one of the best movies of the year. Such a claim is surprising both because \\"Sin City\\" is not generally the kind of movie I like (or so it would appear) and because it doesn't seem to be the type of movie that could be thought of as great. Entertaining, yes. Great, no. <br /> <br />But this movie is indeed great. It is obviously visually innovative and pleasing, taking film noir to the next level. But the subjects the movie delves into--and the way it deals with them--make \\"Sin City\\" stand out. Because, underneath all the flash, \\"Sin City\\" is actually (and don't laugh!) a sophisticated examination of the nature of morality. <br /> <br />The world of \\"Sin City\\" is a world where those institutions and people who are generally seen as bastions of morality turn out to be highly immoral--most notably the church and the police. This could easily lead to the conclusion that Sin City is a place devoid of moral values, and with the amount of deviant behavior in this film, that's an easy judgment to reach.  <br />\\"Sin City\\" is a three-part story, with each part revolving around one of three men: Marv (Mickey Rourke), Dwight (Clive Owen), and John Hartigan (Bruce Willis). Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan each devote themselves fully to protecting a woman, to the point that killing--and possibly dying--for her sake become necessary actions. <br /> <br />What makes \\"Sin City\\" compelling is that although Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan would certainly fail to live up to most moral standards--not only do they kill for their women, they do so without remorse or hesitation--you end up seeing these men as heroes. You want them to succeed; you begin to understand their choices, and you start to believe that not to kill in defense of these women actually might be offensive. <br /> <br />In other words, Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan are most certainly \\"good\\" characters in the eyes of the audience. Does this mean that they aresimply the least immoral in a world filled only with immoral people? Perhaps. But \\"Sin City\\" is world of extraordinary situations, and these men are able to fight against those situations in the defense of an ideal--namely, the safety and redemption of a worthy woman. In this light, \\"Sin City\\" caused me to reflect on my own potential actions in certain situations. There are things every person would be willing to kill or die for, whether it be one's child or one's country. How do you determine what is worth killing for? Is such a killing moral, immoral, or outside of morality? Does your attitude towards such killing make it moral: in other words, must you be regretful and remorseful for it to be moral? I think that it is clear that when we are pushed to our limits, the laws of conventional morality bend. \\"Sin City\\" does a remarkably good job of presenting three men who are each pushed far beyond their limits, and the filmmakers leave it for the audience to decide whether these men are moral defenders or just as immoral as the people they come up against.  <br /> <br />In light of this, I highly recommend this film, both to those who are looking for an entertaining movie and to those who are in search of a thought-provoking one. That \\"Sin City\\" can appeal to both types of people demonstrates just how great this film is.
B00005QB42|5.0|I have all of Deva's CD's and this is still by far, my favorite.  After seeing her in concert at the Midwest Yoga Conference, I appreciate her music even more.  The essence of her music is an inspiration and she eminates this by her presence and spirit.
6303471714|5.0|I do not know why there are such bad reviews about this video.  I love it.  My sister and I both workout with this video and we both love it.  Neither of us have ever had any injuries from it.  It helped us both tone our bodies after having babies.  You can't even tell that I had one baby and I've had three!  I HIGHLY recommend this tape to anyone that is trying to lose weight and tone thier body!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I bought this cd and all i can is wow this is the best foo fighters cd yet. The album comes with 2 discs one harder rock and the other softer rock. Great buy would recommend to any ages and anyone who likes rock.
0316381357|3.0|On the one hand, this book is extremely well written.  Hulme gives an in depth profile of Sister Luke and fantastic descriptions of her surroundings.  We watch Sister Luke struggle to follow all the minute details of the 'Holy Rule'- as an earlier reviewer said, the Holy Rule may as well have come from the military, it is that demanding to follow.  We sympathize with her as she struggles, and in some cases succeeds, other cases fails, to contain her ego and her desires.  We are shocked along with her as she discovers a murdered nun.  We cheer as she helps the Belgian Resistance.  We reflect and empathize with her towards the end as she struggles and finally decides the course of her life.<br /><br />Yet, there is also an incredibly dark side to this book.  Hulme, who writes about convent life so eloquently and with such great understanding, fails miserably in her portrayal of the Congo.  Her Congo is a mysterious wonderland, a jungle with strange natives playing strange drums.  It also happens to be very hot and have deadly diseases.  There is no in depth reflection on the Congolese or their culture; rather, there are lots of harmful stereotypes: the 'good' Congolese are presented as childlike servants who are grateful to the Sisters for their 'civilizing efforts' and who convert to Christianity.  The 'bad' Congolese are the 'savages' and 'monkeys' (yes, the sisters freely refer to Congolese in these demeaning terms) who rebel against the authority of the sisters, and prefer their traditional 'barbaric' ways.  Certainly, there is no mention of the horrors inflicted upon the Congo by the Belgians- people denigrated, maimed, killed, their lands and natural resources stolen, often at gun point.<br /><br />In reality, Belgian Nuns like Sister Luke were at best unknowing cogs or at worst willing participants of a colonialist endeavor in which Belgium exploited the Congo for its natural resources.  (To see the role that the Belgians, including Catholic Nuns from Belgium, REALLY played in the Congo, read KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST.  For a fiction novel with a much better appreciation of Congolese Culture, read THE POISONWOOD BIBLE by Barbara Kingsolver).<br /><br />One cannot excuse Hulme by stating that 'that was the way things were' or 'everyone at that time thought and behaved that way'- this is simply not true.  There was plenty of contemporary criticism of the atrocities of the Belgian Congo.  One is a considered a masterpiece today:  Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS.played in the Congo, read KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST.

B000002MTR|4.0|When I first bought this album I would have been on board with those RHCP fans who were disappointed with it. It certainly is a very different album for them, and as discussed in previous reviews, this is because of Dave Navarro's apperence as lead guitarist. This may have been a sort of culture shock to die hards who wanted the standard RHCP sound. However upon repeated listens ( which I'm sure some fans haven't done ) this album is actually VERY GOOD. If you are considering buying it and you own BSSM or Mother's Milk and expect more of the same you too will be disappointed. It still sounds like the Peppers with Anthony K. & Flea, but the funk is less visible and replaced with more rock. This however does not make it a bad album. Unless you feel the bands you like should never expierment and therefore NEVER GROW.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|In Your Honor is the biggest album the Foo Fighters have released to date.  I contains 20 songs, 10 being some of the hardest rock songs the group has produced and the other 10 being a collection of 5 minute acoustic masterpieces.   <br /> <br />The rock disc has lead singer Dave Grohl straining his voice on nearly every song, delivering a hard rocking power the Foo Fighters occassionaly display on previous records.  Songs like \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"No Way Back\\", and \\"DOA\\" showcase this hard rock style, complete with plenty of distortion and tasteful screaming.  Songs like \\"Best of You\\", \\"Resolve\\" and \\"End over End\\" present a more toned down rock sound similar to previous Foo Fighters songs.  Very simply, the rock disc has so many solid songs, one might find it hard to pick out the next single or judge how many singles to release, its just that good. <br /> <br />The acoustic disc is a ground-breaking work for the Foo Fighters, branching off from the success of the acoustic remakes of favorite Foo Fighter's songs like \\"Times Like These\\" and the ever so popular \\"Everlong.\\"  With the commercial popularity of these works, it is no wonder the Foo Fighters produced a 10 song, purely acoustic disc.  The result is simply remarkable.  The notable tracks include \\"Miracle\\" with John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin playing piano.  The song is simply breath-taking and a soon to be an unforgetable Foo Fighter's hit.  Other songs like \\"Over and Out\\" and \\"Razor\\" provide a great example of Dave Grohl's acoustic guitar abilities.  A true Foo fan's favorite on the record is the summer reminiscent hit \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" with drummer Taylor Hawkins displaying his surprisingly solid singing abilities.   <br /> <br />Quite simply, this is an album that will take the music industry by storm.  People are witnessing the extremes of the Foo Fighter's musical abilities in this album, and the produced songs are simply remarkable.   <br /> <br />Best tracks from each disc: End over End and Miracle will not disappoint.
B0009OPO0S|1.0|Los discos de shakira en el pasado han brillado por sus letras, directas, inteligentes, similes y metaforas coloridas y hasta tropicales, profundas para quien,  empezo cantando y haciendo buenos discos siendo muy joven. Al pasar los a&ntilde;os y encontrar mas posibilidades  creadas por la fama y  un mercado que no es el  propio, ( el norteamericano)  escuchamos Fijacion Oral, que plantea nuevos retos, sin  solventar  nada de lo planteado, si se pretendia hacer temas con cortes de los sesentas, el disco  falla por exceso de tecnologia, y ausencia de voz,  si se quizo dar un toque ochentero,  falla de nuevo al  retomar formulas sencillas  y relegar la voz de la cantante, se escucha en el tipo de temas a lo B52, sin una base ritmica fuerte, las letras cargadas de  poesia son relegadas a destellos muy separados de genialidad, la presencia de Cerati, solo muestra lo que el ya hace y sostuvo en Colombia, mera experimentacion, y la participacion de Saenz es solo digna sin la entrevista. (rodeate mejor la proxima vez...Sabina, LODVG, Serrat, ...ejemmmm)<br /><br />No se encuentra en este disco, participacion de la multinstrumental, porque la tenologia  hace lo que talento realizo en los discos precesores, y los destellos de poesia presentes en la  barranquillera no alcanzan a cubrir los  huecos dejados por ausencia de musica.<br /><br />Si la introspeccion es el punto de Sahkira en 2005, espero que pronto su animo tropical  sobreponga la malentendida frialdad norteamericana a la hora de hacer musica!<br /><br />Han sido mas de 10 a&ntilde;os escuchandola, para luego de haber escuchado por 20 veces Fijacion Oral, saber que a veces no se hace lo que se puede, y a veces se hace mas de lo que se debe.<br /><br />pero Shakira sigue en deuda, y todos sabemos que ella puede...<br /><br />Eso espero aun!
B00092QUQC|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic album. The band comes from Switzerland and they rock. They went back to there original style of melodic hard rock on this one like there first three albums. If you like there early stuff you will like this a lot. I recommend it very much and give it 5 stars.
0060930349|5.0|In the preface to this book, Mr. Johnson relates the comments of one of his Oxford teachers: 'You can study American history when you have graduated, if you can bear it.' There is, apparently, a bit of lingering resentment in the British character.  <br /> <br />Fortunately for us, Mr. Johnson was able to bear American history and has set down a wonderful single volume history of my country that has taught me more about my nation than all the wishy-washy histories I was fed in my schools.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Johnson points out many of the fundamental differences between the United States and the rest of the world, including this one: The entire history of the United States is known and was recorded by first hand witnesses. While Germans can know the history of their current republic, they don't have more than a mythic inkling of when they became a people and later a nation. The Brits can learn about their Celtic ancestors, but at some point, the past grows foggy and recedes into the unknown. But the founders of the United States were first rate writers as well as statesmen and they have recorded it all for us to read and know, and for Mr. Johnson to faithfully report.  <br /> <br />Johnson spends relatively little of his 976 pages on the recent history of the country. His story begins with Colonial America and covers the founding years in detail. He plainly states that our founding fathers, Washington, Jefferson and the rest, were superior to their British counterparts that they outfaced. His detailed description of the run up to our Civil War, including his history of slaves in this country, is not to be matched.  <br /> <br />With hatred of the United States so common in the world, it is encouraging to find a European who sees this country for what it is: a nation of flawed people who have built on the good ideas of the past and extended our bounty to so many others by promoting and defending freedom around the world. Where the United States failed, Mr. Johnson pulls no punches. But where we Americans have succeeded, which has been often, he relates the story in enthralling detail.  <br /> <br />May God bless this gifted writer and researcher and may he live to write many, many more books.  <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Green Day did something alot of bands out today wouldn't be able to. They came back.

0451527046|2.0|It is no surprise that \\"Treasure Island\\" was written by Stevenson just in a few days as its carelessness and pretty bad style attest. On the contrary, it's really surprising that this poor novel could have been intended to be read in \\"one sitting\\" as it took me no less than five days to finish this bore.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I disliked the book was that I usually prefer \\"clean English\\" to \\"slang\\"; if I read English books is precisely to improve my grasp of the language and this novel doesn't contribute to that at all. There are many dialogues in the story written in a confusing and illiterate \\"pirate jargon\\" which make the novel very annoying to read. I should have bought a translation.<br /><br />But, personal preferences aside, this is not the only drawback because, as I kept reading, between one snore and another, I wondered how repetitive and pedestrian the language was and how unfriendly, conventional and dry the characters were. Even the character of John Silver is scarcely charismatic and flat. The book also struck me as so devoid of substantial and perennial meanings that it is beyond my knowledge why it is considered a \\"classic\\" to this day. For me, the only portion of the story I enjoyed were the first six chapters, where you can perceive that something is brewing up; after that, the novel sinks into tediousness until the end.<br /><br />My final piece of advice would be: don't bother to read this poor example of an adventure novel. There are some other books in the genre which I think excel \\"Treasure Island\\". Try for instance \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, \\"The Boats of the Glen Carrig\\" by William Hope Hodgson, or even the sometimes pedantic but ultimately rewarding \\"Moby Dick\\" by Melville. Although any of these books I've mentioned are exempt from minor flaws, they all leave Stevenson's forgettable romance in the gutter. \\"Treasure Island\\" is just a book more popular than others but nothing else.<br /><br />Uninteresting, and you may lay to that.../>Uninteresting, and you may lay to that...
B00062RCBW|5.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation lived longer than the '60s series.  It was because the orginal series reached 79 episodes and went into re-runs that the show became quite popular.  In the late '80s, we are again onboard the Enterprise...but not the same Enterprise; a Klingon on the bridge is a major change, and an android replaces Spock.  That is NOT to say that 'The Next Generation'  ripped off the orginal series.  Okay, so the first season borrowed a few stories ( \\"The Naked Now\\" ), but it does have orginal stories ( \\"The Big Goodbye\\" , \\"110101001\\" )  By the end of the 1st season, the crew had lost Tasha Yar ( \\"Skin Of Evil\\" ).<br /><br />  The second season begins when Troi gets pregnant ( \\"The Child\\" ), Data plays Sherlock Holmes ( \\"Elemarty, Dear Data\\" ), and a lovable rogue teaches Data what is funny ( \\"The Outrageous Okana\\" ).  The second season was still stumbling along.  It wasn't until the 3rd season, the show began to hit its stride.<br /><br />  Any Trek fan will love this 7 year run of 'The Next Generation\\"
0784011710|5.0|Streep's performance here is awe-inspiring.  Even Kevin Kline said so.  He said that sometimes he forgot his lines, he was so transfixed by Streep's.  No one else even comes close, especially not Katherine Hepburn (even less Audrey Hepburn).  Only some of Streep's other roles rival this one.  Beyond that, this film should have won not only cinematography that year, as it says above, but best picture.  Gandhi was good, this is better.  Kline holds his own with what is still his best performance, and even MacNichol is not completely swamped.  I think he is miscast, but at a second viewing (and forgetting the book) he begins to grow on you.  Speaking of the book, this is one film that is better than the book--for an other example, see Blade Runner.  Styron's book has some nice passages, and is full of good ideas, but artistically it is a mess.  It cries out for a super-edit, and this film does that pretty well.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|The film \\"Constantine\\" should not be considered a horror movie. I would call it a \\"Thriller\\"; that seems more befitting. It is a very Theologically-based movie. <br /> <br />\\"Constantine\\" is about John Constantine - a man trying to buy his way into Heaven with the extraordinary gifts of being able to see and talk to supernatural beings and being able to perform exorcisms. He meets a young detective who is investigating the death of her twin sister. As the plot progresses you are able to see that things are on a much grander scale than originally thought. <br /> <br />This movie brings many things into play other than good acting and special effects. Despite the other reviews, Keanu Reeves does a very good job in this film and it is by no means a \\"Matrix\\" rip-off. In truth, Keanu Reeves is a very good actor who has made the mistake of taking some very bad roles. His performance in \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" was stunning.
B00004KD11|5.0|Ever since SHADES OF... appeared, Deep Purple set a pattern of being years ahead of their time.<br /><br />When you first hear the opening track \\"And The Address,\\" you are calmed by Jon Lord's Hammond organ, then he cranks it up for a sonic blast, he is joined by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, drummer Ian Paice and bassist Nick Simper for the full on assault! Classic Deep Purple! \\"Hush\\" follows and is so psychedelic and ahead of its time....no wonder it's timeless! Then comes my favorite, the beautiful \\"One More Rainy Day\\" with it's nifty drum work to showcase Paice's talents. Then you slide right into \\"I'm So Glad\\" which really brings out the vocals of Rod Evans. And then there's \\"Hey Joe.\\" Total excellence. I am convinced that this is a better cover version than Hendrix's. The jamming \\"Mandrake Root\\" is a great filler, something most bands never obtain. The Beatles song \\"Help\\" is also covered. It works! John Lennon once said, \\"That's the way the Beatles should have done it\\". Enough said. The rest of the songs (including bonus tracks) are great, too. The playing and the singing is fantastic. The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />This is vintage, progressive rock ahead of it's time for 1968. Sit back, crank this up, turn down the lights, and the sounds will take you away. Folks, this is a classic and a stellar way for Deep Purple to launch their historic career. Quit comparing and just enjoy this unique and cool first album. Totally underrated.
0060007737|4.0|Interesting read but here's my question. As this book points out, there can only be one brand for the internet. Dell is the king of the 'PC ordering system', and then they say Yahoo is king of search engines. I understand that this book was brought out before Google was such a player, but that goes to show you that their laws of internet branding does not work. Yahoo and Google are the Pepsi and Coke of online search engines. There is healthy competition and so while the 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is dead on target and a great read, I feel the add on '11 laws of internet branding' is not 100% correct.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Edgar Wright's \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a hilarious romp through the cliches of zombie movies, slackerdom, and romantic comedies.  Tossing the genres of horror and comedy into a blender and getting the mix just right, \\"Shaun\\" is one of those movies that earns the compliment, \\"destined to be a cult classic.\\"    The titular Shaun (Simon Pegg) has an intriguing ambition -- for nothing to change whatsoever.  The outset of the movie sees Shaun's ambition being challenged, as reality checks in to tell him that he's not doing all that well.  29 years old and in a job he can't muster up the passion for to hate (mid-management at an electronics store), Shaun also learns that his wonderful girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) wants him to grow up, or else.  And his responsible flatmate wants him to kick out his slacker roomie, Ed (Nick Frost, in a hilarious performance) due to his flatulence and his inability to even make money dealing drugs.    Single, rejected and dejected, Shaun retreats to the only place in the world that makes sense -- his home away from home, the pub entitled \\"the Winchester.\\"  On the way home, Shaun and Ed nearly bump into several staggering drunks . . . or are they drunks?  One of the most hilarious running gags in the movie is the amazing ability of our hero to fail to realize that London is beset by zombies!  A long, uncut scene of Shaun walking to the corner market for a morning beverage, nearly running into the arms of about fifteen zombies, is a masterpiece.    But soon, even our dense hero realizes that strange things are afoot.  Ed and Shaun come face to face with a few zombies, and quickly learn the basic rules of fighting the undead.  First, the undead are rather slow (\\"Shaun\\" has several hilarious lines of dialogue as humans bicker over trivial matters while the undead shamble ever-so-slowly towards them -- well, maybe not trivia -- if you're going to use your record collection as zombie-decapitating missiles, wouldn't you start with Sade and save the New Order?).  Second, the head is the only really vulnerable spot.  Third, don't let them bite you, under any circumstances.     Ed and Shaun are assembling the stereotypical rag-tag bunch of supporting characters, including Liz, a couple of friends with hidden agendas, and Shaun's beloved mom and hated step-dad.  As you can expect, some of these characters are more or less expendable.  \\"Shaun\\" has some yucks with these cliches as well -- watch for a hilarious scene as one rag-tag bunch of survivors runs into another mirror-image rag-tag bunch of survivors heading in the opposite direction.    Shaun leads his troupe to the only bastion of common sense and reality left in his world - the beloved Winchester.  The flight to the pub and the defense of the pub give the filmmakers several great opportunities for humor and scares, and they get high marks for both.  A brief epilogue is both hilarious and somewhat poignant, as one is shown the true value of a friendship that can survive even the biggest obstacles.      We are going through a strange revival of the zombie movie these days.  From George Romero's new \\"Land of the Dead\\" to the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" to \\"28 Days Later\\" on the more traditional front to \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\" on the humorous side, we've never seen more pure \\"zombie flicks\\" at one time on the big screen, as far as I can tell.  \\"Shaun\\" both sends up and honors the cliches of the zombie sub-genre of horror film, and it does so in wonderful style.  Both scary and hilarious -- listen for the perfect example of a witty soundtrack -- \\"Shaun\\" is a must-see for horror fans and for fans of British comedy.      While the DVD extras on \\"Shaun\\" are good, the movie is the reason to get this DVD.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a big disappoint for me. I found the story boring and slow.  But, this isn't about the first Star Trek movie.  This is about the improved sequel, The Wrath of Khan.  And so begins the curse of the Star Trek movies.  The Curse--as everybody knows--is that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are good ones.<br /><br />  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan shows no signs of the previous movie.  It has colorful uniforms and a good villain.  And it has William Shantner's \\"KHAAAANN!\\" yell.<br /><br />  It's the 23rd century, and Kirk is now an Admiral.  An old enemy of his comes back for revenge.  Khan, a superhuman from the 1990's, is angry with Kirk for leaving him on a planet.  Of course, Kirk defeats Khan, but Spock dies at the end...or does he?
B0009HLDFU|3.0|The second CD (the acoustic one) is pretty bad.  Its way to slow.     That being said, the first CD is good and makes this worth buying; the second CD only raises the cost by a couple of dollars which is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4. <br /> <br />The first CD is the typical Foo Fighters music.  I don't like it as much as their self-titled album or \\"The Shape & Colour\\" but it is still good.  I would say that I like it as much as \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\" and \\"One by One.\\"  If you didn't like either of those, you're not likely to like this.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Travis is my favorite band. I love them even more than the shins and keane and weezer. I know all the words to all the songs and have all the albums, so I think i can call myself a travis expert. When I was looking at the reviews for this album, I was shocked to see the numerous four star reviews. Four stars?!?!? that's it? With all due respect, I believe this album deserve more than five stars!  <br />The Invisible Band should probably be just called THE MAN WHO, PART TWO, because it really does pick up right where that album left off. For people who like to see bands evolve, they will of course be disappointed. But for those of us who craved more MAN WHO like material, this CD is brilliant. But I would like to take the time to clean a few things up, which have been overlooked. <br />I think some of the more obvious singles have eclisped the other songs, which are all polished works of art. SING is a great song, and the banjo is a great touch. But everyone knows about that song, so what about DEAR DIARY? DEAR DIARY is personally, my favorite song on the album. I'm usually not much of a slow song kind of person, but this song is simply amazing. The lyrics are very Travis-like, and sad, and fit right in on the album, and I love how the chorus is so melodious. They didn't even need to say the words and you could understand them, thats the kind of emotion on this piece. SIDE is of course a classic, portraying the frustration of 'the grass is always greener on the other side' kind of attitude. But the clever lyrics fit along the music so well, this song is a masterpiece. PIPE DREAMS: many people mentioned this song as one of their favorites. Personally, I think it is the weakest song on the album. At the beginning, it sounds really awesome and you are drawn in by the catchy melody. But i think after a while, it gets kind of repetitve. FLOWERS IN THE WINDOW is another general favorite. Everyone likes this song, but I don't think it compares to songs like DEAR DIARY. It does show the happier side of Travis, which makes it more interesting. THE CAGE is a song that most people don't like. I confess I didn't like it either, until one day I found myself humming the songs catchy tune. On first listen, it seems like it kind of sucks. But once you get to the chorus, you'll love it. SAFE is one of the strongest songs on the album. The song itself is great, but I challenge people to listen for the harmonic guitar in the background during the chorus. This song is really good. FOLLOW THE LIGHT is definantly the most solid song on the album. It's easy to listen too, and the lyrics are great, because everyone can get something out of them, and the song is really assuring...it makes you relax and it's the kind of song that makes you happy just listening to it, and if an artist can create a song like that, then they are brilliant. LAST TRAIN is a good song, I didn't love it at first because I thought it boring, but then I soon came back to it. The lyrics have the kind of hopeless sadness in them that make you feel so sad but keep coming back. AFTERGLOW is a good song, with a cool riff too. The chorus is safe and easy to listen too, this song doesn't challenge listeners, but it's still an excellent song. INDEFINITELY is one of the best songs on the album, one of the best travis songs ever, and the lyrics are sad but simply amazing. The pleading voice is so pleasing to the ear that this song will always be a favorite of mine. Lastly is the HUMPTY DUMPTY LOVE SONG. Many people raise questions about the strange title, but humpty dumpty is actually a simile for the guy's broken heart. This song gets especially great at the end and is a great song to listen to and fall asleep too. The extra hidden tracks in it are quite good as well.  <br />Overall, every song on this CD is worth a listen and I want everyone to know that is CD is a five star CD, not a four!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!!! I'm not really into opera music but I found that I liked the musical part. The movie was very well done. Emma Rossum has an amazing voice!! The movie has alittle bit of everything in it, from action, to romance, to suspence, and even comical!!! At first it was hard to understand. You really have to listen to the songs. There really isn't that much talking. I found that I now would much like to have to soundtrack. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!!! If you don't like musicals you should still see it. Trust me it's worth the $4.50 you'll pay to rent it!!! It's even worth the amount of money you pay to buy it!! I have turned a new leaf in my movie watching for the rest of my life. <br /> <br />DON'T LET THIS MOVIE SLIP PAST YOU!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|SOAD definetly sounds like no other band out there, that's why I bought this cd... It's good on a whole, but I would like to point out for those who are looking for extremly philosophical and deep lyrics: you won't get them here, (with the partial exception of sad statue and lost in hollywood) SOAD should not be known for excellent lyrics because they are much too repetitive and obvious. THIS DOES NOT MEEN THAT THIS IS A BAD RECORD!!! The guitars and melodies in this are very clever. One of SOAD's amazing abilities is being able to change from soft lulling and wonderfull melodies to sharp shocking and hard crashing guitar riffs.<br /><br />  When I listen to this cd I usually skip over Violent Pornagraphy because it is extremly repetitive and anoying, but I like all the other songs. Some of the best songs are Sad Statue, Lost in Hollywood, and Cigaro. Before getting this you may want to pick up Toxicity if you havn't allready because it is definetly their best.
B00005JNJT|5.0|The ultimate argument of \\"Batman Begins\\" is that Batman is really more like Superman than we have suspected. The two DC comic book superheroes have always been like night and day, with Batman prowling Gotham City at night relying on only his finely honed human abilities while Superman uses his superpowers for truth, justice, and the American way. But one of the things that made Superman unique was that he really is Superman, the strange visitor from another planet: he pretends to be Clark Kent. \\"Batman Begins\\" argues that the same thing applies to Batman. His name might be Bruce Wayne, but the billionaire the world sees is just a construct. Batman is his true face.<br /><br />Batman is a psychotic and in this 2005 film we find out why. Before his parents were murdered young Master Wayne had a fateful encounter with a whole bunch of bats, and the two events actually end up being related, which makes the death of his parents even more tragic. Despite the protestations of the loyal Alfred, Bruce Wayne knows it is his fault. But while becoming a crime fighter is inevitable there is still a choice as to how that war will be waged, which means traveling halfway around the world to be mentored and trained.. Then he must return to Gotham City and transform himself into a creature of the night whose very appearance will terrorize the criminals and supply himself with the gadgets that will give him a fighting chance on the streets. However, Gotham is being threatened by more than its ruling crime lord and the stakes are higher than our hero knows.<br /><br />The problem is that I hate the frantic pace of film editing in action films like \\"Batman Begins.\\" I am not overly enamored of hand held camera work either, but it is constant cutting in contemporary montage that is driving me crazy. When I go to a theater to see a movie I would like to actually see what is going on and not have to wait until the DVD comes out to slow things down to really see what is going on. This approach to editing did not start with \\"Batman Begins,\\" but since I was looking forward to this cinematic retelling of the origin of the Dark Knight it was particularly bothersome. Every time Batman starts fighting the images are on the screen long enough that I can tell it is a new shot but then we are on to the next one while I try to make sense of the jumbled images of these fight scenes.<br /><br />Maybe the key reason why \\"Spider-Man 2\\" remains the best comic book movie to date is because since the tentacles of Doctor Octopus had to be computer generated Spider-Man was be as well in their big fight scenes. There is not a sequences as good in \\"Batman Returns\\" as the one where Spidey and Doc Ock battle on the side of the building in \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" mainly because there is not a single shot in the action sequences of this new film even half as long as that one. Meanwhile there are lots of martial arts films in which we managed to see what is happening during their big fight sequences, so how come we cannot do the same thing in this Batman movie? When Batman fights I want to see what he is doing flip through shots like I was flipping through the pages of an issue of a \\"Batman\\" comic book. It is maddening.<br /><br />The big irony is that usually movies about comic book superheroes sacrifice story to action, but that is not the case with this screenplay, co-written by director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer (based on characters created by Bob Kane, but with obvious nods to Frank Miller's work, especially \\"Batman: Year One\\"). Originally the story was quite simple: young Bruce Wayne sees his parents gunned down by a robber. He builds up his body, studies science and decides to become a masked vigilante, taking as his inspiration a bat that flies against a window of Wayne Manor. Noland and Goyer provide more depth to the origin, which adds to the depth of the character as well, which is why I rounded up on this one in the end. The only real flaw in their scriptis an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time). That is why when people talk about their favorite bits in this film they will probably be talking about one-liners (virtually every scene has one) and not any particular action sequence or specific gag.<br /><br />Few will be surprised that Christian Bale has no problems playing the Dark Knight, and a supporting cast that offers by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman is pretty impressive for a comic book movie. It is too bad that Katie Holmes is not only 16 years younger than the youngest in that bunch because she seems like a kid and not an Assistant D.A. with a death wish, and there is no reason for her to be around for the next one given her benedictory speech. Besides, if Batman works even more closely with Lieutenant Gordon to catch the Joker in the next movie, that would be fine with me. The bottom line here is that while I have no problem with the idea this is the best Batman movie to date, the action sequences were not as good as the other parts of the movie and they should have been in order to move \\"Batman Begins\\" from being very good to being truly great.heir script is an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time).

0812550706|4.0|I generally do not read science fiction. As a woman, they tend to be a little too virile for me. I actually barrowed this book on CD from a friend and listened to it on a drive from Sacramento, California to Colorado. It certainly served its purpose of entertaining me on my long road-trip. I found myself eager to get back in my car while pumping gas to hear what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The story takes place in the future and earth has been invaded twice by an alien race. Leaders of the world have created a military school to essentially mold young children into perfect soldiers. Ender is chosen to enter into the school at the age of six and surpasses virtually all his peers in rank at an astonishing rate. He demonstrates exceptional intelligence, resolve, and physical ability. I don't want to go into the plot too much because I don't want to spoil anything, but that is the basic premise of the book.<br /><br />The book is very entertaining and very much a `page turner'. I love the overall message that the book gives and the ending (for me) was unexpected. I do, however, feel character developments and overall descriptions could have been a bit better. Unlike most books I read (or in this case, hear) I am usually taken away from reality and enter into the world of the characters I am reading about. That didn't happen with this story. I felt as if I was just being told the story rather than being pulled into it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the story; it was engrossing and on-the-edge-of-your-seat at times. I just feel as if Card could have done a better job getting me inside the heads of the characters and getting me into this world he created.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very good book, even for non-sci-fi fans.
B00081MUY0|5.0|If Donovan had died young like Nick Drake or lost his mind like Syd Barrett, everyone would recognize his greatness now.  Rather, like Paul McCartney, Donovan is a well-adjusted guy who's lived a full life, who made some absolutely brilliant music in the 60's and some less-than-brilliant music after the 60's.  Good for him, but lousy for his legend.    In my opinion, Sunshine Superman is his best album, although Mellow Yellow, A Gift From a Flower to a Garden, and Hurdy Gurdy Man are also excellent.  Sunshine Superman includes three of Donovan's greatest hits -- the title track, Season of the Witch, and the Trip -- all great rock songs, but, for me, what makes this record shine is the other album tracks.  Songs like Legend of a Girl Child Linda, Three Kingfishers, the Fat Angel and bonus track Breezes of Patchulie are simply some of the best psychedelic-chamber-folk-pop songs ever recorded.  John Cameron's arrangements are gorgeous throughout.  If you like languid mood music with beautiful melodies, and the sounds of sitars and harpsichords, these tunes are bliss (and honestly, if you don't like such things, you shouldn't be listening to Donovan anyway).      One more thing: this record sounds AMAZING.  Partly this is due to whoever engineered it forty years ago, but whoever remastered it this year is a genius.  EMI, PLEASE hire the responsible party to remaster the Beatles' catalog IMMEDIATELY.    One complaint though: the liner notes are very poorly written.
1591396190|5.0|I am a software engineer starting an automotive advertising business. I have been edifying myself on business over the last year, absorbing all the business info I can from reading books and talking to people. I have to say that this book has been the most helpful, with its out-of-the-box thinking backed with solid real world examples and powerful, simple, and implementable strategies. Most books that address the issues of competing in a crowded market concentrate on how to develop a niche and focus a those customers that demand it. This book addresses this issue from a whole different angle, and very elegantly I might add.<br /><br />The authors tell you to identify all the factors that your competitors (and you) currently compete on. Decide which factors you will eliminate and reduce, factors that reduce margins, etc. Then, focus your efforts on innovating new business factors; factors where you will not go head to head with your competition, yet offer the customer added benefits. There are so many real examples in the book along with their six strategy process that I immediately thought of a few new business factors for my upcoming business. Diverging from the status quo, in effect, moves you from the violent red ocean into the calm blue ocean. Then you need to create a barrier to your newly created ocean. If the new business factors are patentable, required large/existing/non-attainable assets, or created some other natural barrier to the market, then your safe for awhile. Otherwise you will need to use strategic pricing as your barrier, like South West Airlines did. Strategic pricing (process detailed in the book) and creating new business factors (customer benefits) IS value-innovation! This is giving the customer more for less and can only happen in the blue ocean. Companies would go broke doing this in the red ocean!<br /><br />Strategic pricing will help you set your price low enough that you will attract customers from the red ocean and your newly created business factors may even attract customers that were previously non-existent. The execution of your strategy must be very swift and focused, trying to gain as much market share as quickly as possible and making it tough for competitors to enter your blue ocean, much like Microsoft and Wal-Mart have done. This strategy totally goes against the traditional \\"find a niche, concentrate on select customers\\", in-the-box kind of thinking that I have been accustomed to reading for the last year.<br /><br />I really love this book and could go on and on. I would easily have paid many times more for this book, as it has become an asset to my new business. As a software guy, all problems look like software problems (if the customers don't like it, add more bells and whistles, etc.). Well, I think this book has finally got me thinking like a business savvy exec.ated business factors may even attract customers that were previously non-existent.

B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This is the first story. Then... lot of stories followed it. At least, they get ideas from it. (don't you see even some 'matrix' similarities with lot of things?)...<br /><br />It's an awesome movie.
0689835604|5.0|I started reading to our daughter when she was about 6 weeks.  This is is by far her \\"favorite\\" book.  When she was 8 weeks she really started noticing the large illustrations of baby faces.  They bring a huge smile to her face every time we turn each page.  We read this book every day.  Seeing her face light up brings a smile to my face too.  I just ordered 2 other Karen Katz books because she responded so well to this one.  I highly recommend this for reading time with your infant.
6304711905|5.0|Val Kilmir. Enough said. He plays doc holiday, and he makes the movie worth watching, and kurt russell is also worthy. I also enjoyed Dana Delany becvause she is beautiful and a great actress. The main reason why this movie was so good was the great lines. I GOT TWO GUNS, ONE FOR EACH OF YA! Just alot of western bad ass talk that we all love and reminds us of DO YOU FEEL LUCKY WELL DO YA PUNKS clint eastwood movies. It's all good and fun. It's basically about the ok corall, and mostly a true story but as with all movies, some of it exaggerated and obviously for enteratinment, not boring documentaries and they couldnt have chosen better actors than russell and kilmir.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|I can take the fact that it's not faithful to the comic, no comic book movie really is  (With the exception of Sin City) but when the movie is done this badly, you have to stand up and call it like it is. Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.  I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original. <br /> <br />If you like to watch bad movies, then have yourself a good time, because the movie is that bad but if you looking for a good film that respects the comic book, this is not it.  <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This cd Will Go Down As The Biggest Dissapointment of 2005.. This cd just flat out suxks.. there are 3 good songs BYOB, CIGARO AND Violent PORNOGRAPHY thats it.. i will surely not be buying Hypotize in the fall..
B00005JKCH|5.0|in this movie, ordinary Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider(in the comics and cartoons, the spider was radioactive)and gets his name \\"Spider-Man\\" from a wrestling match with BoneSaw McGraw(played by Macho Man Randy Savage)and soon faces the Green Goblin (Harry Osborn, who was enhanced by a chemical). he later wins against the Green Goblin by accidently killing him with his own glider. this movie is the bomb!
B000002WYT|5.0|This is my third Dave Matthews album, and its just as good as the others. Busted Stuff was good, and so was his solo album, Some Devil. This album easily competes with both.<br /><br />Two Step is my favorite DMB song ever, and I've always loved Crash Into Me. Trippin Billies is good too, as are the rest of the songs really. Dave's guitar work is as awesome as ever, and the drumming is always sweet.<br /><br />Check out his other stuff if you end up liking this one.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is visually stunning. From one frame to the next you are washed with the most beautiful pictures that take your breathe away. Then, you hear the most beautiful music...<br /><br />Emmy Rossum, as Christine, the young girl that belongs to the ballet chorus, and has a stunning voice, discovered and taught by her Angel of Music, that she has never seen.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson, her childhood sweetheart who discovers her once again, and wants to save and protect her.<br /><br />Gerard Butler, as the phantom...Christine's Angel, who lives below the opera house, dresses in black, wears a white mask that covers half his face and terrorizes the Opera Company and it's owners.He falls in love with his student, and when Roaul enters the picture, he becomes jealous and obsessive.What follows is passion, violence, and an ending that twists the heart.It will move you to tears...it is true gothic romance with an exciting and frightening twist.Gerard Butler will blow you away with his wonderful acting, and the bonus is he is sexiness personified.Buy it, you won't be sorry!
B000002UVX|5.0|I too have to agree that while I really love this CD, I am not overly fond of Buddy Miles' singing. But then apparently neither was Hendrix. Several biographies imply that Jimi was not pleased with Buddy's singing and Eddie Kramer stated that while he and Jimi were editing the concert tapes, Jimi sat with his head in his hands saying over and over, \\"Please shut up Buddy\\". However these excesses are not as prevalent in the CD due to editing as they are on the DVD of the concert. <br /> <br />Also, some make more out of the fact that three \\"brothers\\" made this music than should be. I don't believe Hendrix was ever concerned with the color of a person's or musician's skin, at least not as concered as everyone who analyzes his music seems to be.  <br /> <br />In the end, none of that matters. What matters is that Jimi made music that was out of this world. Because in the end, the music is all that matters. Jimi knew that.
0385510438|3.0|I have trouble forming words for this review because the book just didn't leave me with much.  It was mediocre at best.  The main character, Willie Traynor, moves to Ford County, Mississippi to work for a small weekly newspaper.  When the owner goes bankrupt he buys the paper and thus begins his future in Clanton.  The main focus on the legal thriller side of the book is a murder and rape of a widow that is witnessed by her two small children.  The perpetrator is a member of a powerful family that is into nothing legal.  The flip side of the book is the wide range of characters that Willie encounters in Clanton.  This, by far, is the more interesting portion of the novel.  However it is not until the reader is completely bored and disappointed with the murder trial that we realize that the book has something to offer.  The characters turn out to be highly sympathetic and entertaining, but too late in the book.  I do not know why I continue to buy Grisham's books because they have been so disappointing for so long.  At least this one had some redeeming qualities, but not many.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|oka, I just want to comment on the dvd before the review.  They left some things out: <br />DVD <br />* The Swagga - -Exclusive Audio Track <br />* Feel Good Inc - Video <br />* Feel Good Inc - The Making Of Animatic <br />* Feel Good Inc - Audio commentary from the band <br />* Gorillaz Talent Quest - G Bite Animation <br />* Gorillaz On Set - G Bite Animation <br />* Special online access to exclusive Wallpapers & Screensaver. Access to special 'Key' to unlock secret parts of the Gorillaz Website including free download of bonus track \\"Happy Landfill\\" <br /> <br />Includes 32 Page extended booklet <br /> <br /> <br />Now, I just want to say, this is not my style of music.  I don't like rap or much hop hop or techno stuff. much.  Whatever the gorillaz are, I love them.  Thr first time I heard this cd on the soun clips here, it sucked.  The first time I heard it on cd, it sucked.  The first time I listened to the whole thing with headphones I loved it.  I don't know what else to say except give it some time, and at least a chance <br />
B0007MAO0M|3.0|I loved Silverado when it first came out and still do, but this crud that they packaged and pushed as the greatest gunfights is a 'bait and switch' tactic at best.....  I wish I had read the review of that trailer before I had bought the DVD.  There was no history of the cinematic western gunfight given at all......  Did they mention Shane?  High Noon?  Any John Wayne or Clint Eastwood movie?  This clip was nothing more that self-promotion of recently or soon to be released DVD's by this same group.  What I might have rated a 4 or 5, is only a 3 at best........
B00005J9U1|1.0|Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible.
B000002H5I|5.0|This woman is amazing! One of the greatest Singer/Songwriters of ALL time. Her voice sends chills down your spine, yet makes you really HEAR what she's saying. Her songs are so moving. She's unlike anyone else out there. It's always so refreshing to hear someone come out with such albums when everyone else is focused on something completely different.  <br /> <br />I have always loved Tracy. She's always struck a certain chord for me. I just love her. Her lyrics are SO passionate and filled with SO much pain, emotion, and speaking about the issues. You just can't help but FEEL what she's saying. And sometimes even cry.  <br /> <br />All of her cds are great, and she's evolved her sound through out the years, but this cd speaks to me the most. Talking about poor people, being a runaway, having a hard life, spousal abuse, racial issues, starving children and so much more has really made this cd speak to me! It made me want to change, be a better person and respect all life. Treat people well. And do what I can when someone needs help. This cd is just incredible!!! It's one of my favorite albums of all time. <br /> <br />Tracy Chapman is legendary.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is what rock and roll is all about. Loud,nasty and catchy the guns would have gone on to be greater than the rolling stones axl rose was well on his way to greatest front man and slah was the best gitarist of the 90's its shame what has happened since,but there is no denying Guns N F'N ROSES!!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Well, I just bought TOT after watch one of the most amazing rock concerts, DT - Live at Budokan.  Since I can't get the live cd yet, I decided to go to the store and buy TOT considering there are 5 of the 7 songs of TOT played at the Budokan.  As I read in previous reviews, I think that this album are made for grown up progressive rock listeners; is so heavy, so melodically perfect, so perfectly performed by these rock masters, you will fall in love with the music of the album just after few plays.  Honestly, it sound more powerful and raw in the live cd of Budokan.  The best song of the album? I think it would be \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" just amazing, Petrucci and Rudess at their best. Anyway you would enjoy the songs if you hear it in the Budokan cd, by the way DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, BUY LIVE AT BUDOKAN IN DVD!!!! (simply one of the best rock concerts I've ever seen).  Those who give less than 4 stars to this cd are simply poppers or rappers (nothing against them), but they should not be spamming while they review the album.    IN SUMMARY:  Dream Theater's heaviest album.  Long and technically perfect songs, mindblowing riffs. A progressive rock masterpiece.
B00082IJ08|5.0|When I heard about the gorillaz new album, I was very happy, cause I had just become a new fan, actually, they are my favourite band, and I loved their last cd, So I quickly got the cd, and just got it today, and listening to it for the first time now. They're music has taken a much more up beat take(probably cause its written by a different band memeber) but at the same time, keepet the different style that they had before. The bass is heavy, they have alot of guest artists, and good beats, the only song that I find to be even slightly bad is the first song \\"intro\\" which even then(for some reason) I like. All the songs play at a reasonable length, catchy rythem, and still keep its original flare that the other album had <br /> <br />All gorillaz fans should like this cd. And those looking for something new in music should go for this as well, and like its original take on music.
B00097DX3U|3.0|I'm a huge Soundgarden fan, and really liked the first Audioslave effort.  But, after listening to Out of Exile several times, I'm left feeling indifferent. It's a decent cd. That's it.  <br /> <br />To me, there are really no standout tracks here.  They all kind of blend together into a cohesive, yet boring album.  There's nothing that draws me in to listen again. <br /> <br />I think Audioslave were just going through the motions here. I don't feel any passion or inspiration when listening to these songs. <br /> <br />I'm glad to see that some people are liking this album. I'd love for these guys to put out another, because I just really don't like this one. Very boring and ho-hum.
B000069AUI|5.0|Again, from beginning to end, this album is a complete gem! My girlfriend at the time told me about this new song Coldplay had just released in Europe; the song was \\"The Scientist.\\" As soon as i heard that song i fell in love with it. Little did i know those lyrics, as well as the lyrics for \\"Warning Sign\\" would come back to haunt me and torture me endlessly. Anyway, songs like Clocks, In My Place, The Scientist, Warning Signs, Green Eyes and Amsterdam are amazing. Not since U2 has a band so consistantly made great music!!  Overall, Coldplay is the best band in the world! Sorry 2U..i love you too guys..but Coldplay gets my money!!!
B0009NSE1K|1.0|If you're looking for an album that you can get on the first listen, forget Robot Hive.  From the standpoint of listenability, this album is lacking.  Where Blast Tyrant grabs you and takes you for a ride, this album bores you and makes you want to get off at the next stop.  If this is your first Clutch purchase, you best choose \\"Clutch\\", \\"Blast Tyrant\\" or even the \\"Impetus EP\\".  Hard rock and metal are supposed to make you proud to crank it up in the car.  Not make you sink low in the seat and hide.
B0000508U6|5.0|From beginning to end, this album is a complete relic! I remember seeing the video for \\"Yellow\\" on MTV and thinking \\"Wow, this is different and it sounds great.\\" That was the day i knew the world was in for a much needed musical treat! \\"Trouble\\" is my third  favorite song out of all of Coldplay's songs. Their follow-up album A Rush of Blood To The Head is another modern classic. Songs like \\"Clock, In My Place, A Warning Sign, The Scientist and  Green Eyes\\" make this album a must have! I just recently purchased X&Y and i must say is shaping up to be just as good as their previous work.  I also ran into their barely known \\"Blue Room\\" album. This album is great!!! \\"See you soon\\" was a glimpse of what was to come from Coldplay! Overall, Coldplay is the best band in the world! Sorry 2U..i love you too guys..but Coldplay gets my money!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|I love this cd. I first heard about Kylie from \\"Can't Get You Out Of Your Head\\". The same time I was listening to techno music alot on the radio. Soon, I started liking her other singles \\"Love At First Sight\\", \\"Come Into My World\\", and \\"Into Your eyes\\". Her music in this is really really good....next to Madonna. She make dance music sound sooooooo good!
B00003CX95|5.0|I recently saw this movie on DVD and, it took a second look to truly appreciate the wonder and scope of this awesome film. If you have seen it already like most of us and you don't own it yet, buy the DVD and see it again in WIDESCREEN! Even if you dislike black bars, a film with excellent cinematography such as this must be watched in widescreen (besides, fullscreen cuts off %50 of the movie, believe it or not. Bleh!!) If you have not seen it, get it now! It is a celebration of the human spirit, and a classic film. As William Wallace said, \\"It's not how you die that's important, but how you live!\\" So true, and you have not lived until you have seen and fully appreciated Mel Gibson's best film!
B000957O82|4.0|This movie was an instant classic. There was lots of funny scenes in the movie and there was also some good scenes in the movie. First off, the part of Will Smith as Alex Hitchens was a great acting part and a great casting pick. This is a Will Smith movie that I like with no aliens. Another great actor that was in the movie was Kevin James (King of Queens). He played an amazing part as Albert Brennaman. He was funny and showed a lot of spirit into this acting part. I never watch his TV Show, but I liked his acting part and thought he was funny. These two make the storyline of the movie interesting as the storyline is when Albert Brennaman has problems with the ladies and needs Alex Hitch to help him get the girl of his dreams. Another great actress in the movie was Eva Mendes as Sara Melas. She played a great part again in a comedy. That is all I have to say about this movie. I hope that this movie does good in DVD's as it did on the Box Office.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is about these five teenagers from various backgrounds and social statures held in detention on a saturday morning. The theme of this movie is really great because it emphasizes that no matter who you are; we are all the same. Not too much happens in the movie because most of the movie has the characters talking to each other throughout the film.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a very witty and original movie to own.<br /><br />The High School Reunion Edition DVD comes in a anamorphic widescreen presentation with the choice of Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 audio. It also includes a theatrical trailer, and a interactive menu. In other words, it's a barebones disc, but it's worth the purchase for the remastered picture.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I am an avid fan of Nine Inch Nails.  And simply put this is the most worthless album next to an avril lavigne album.  I am no music connoiseur.  Not even sure if i spelled that right.  But comparatively, Trent Reznor has gone into a downward spiral musically.  PHM was the best album ever.  Broken followed it up with its brashness.  The Downward Spiral expanded into concept territory as none before.  The Fragile awed me with its melodies.  With Teeth is an album unworthy of NiN.  It sounds like Reznor got up one day and said, \\"Hey guys.  You know what.  I got an idea.  Lets give up our roots and copy what everyone else is doing now.  Only lets throw in some weird melodies half these other idiots never thought of.\\"  That's all this album is.  And I like Trent Reznor, the old Reznor, so that's really hard for me to say, but it is true.
B00006FDCD|5.0|A made-for-tv movie, Stephen King's \\"It\\" is about 7 children (They call theirselves the \\"Lucky Seven\\") who, along with other kids, are terrorized by a clown named Pennywise, who uses their worst fears against them. After they ALMOST defeat the clown as kids, Pennywise gets away. However, he comes back 30 years later to kill more children and to haunt them again! It's up to the remaining six (one character commits suicide) to take Pennywise down once and for all. The cast consists of John Ritter, Seth Green, and Jonathan Brandis, among others. It's 3 hours and 12 minutes long, but it kept me entertained. However, the DVD is 3 hours and 7 minutes long due to edits:<br /><br />At the end of part 1, the final showing of \\"IT\\" written in the blood on the bathroom wall after Stan's wife finds that he has slit his wrist in the bathtub, accompanied by Pennywise laughing and \\"to be continued\\" has been cut.<br /><br />Part 2 starts with Bill arriving at the Derry cemetery. This completely cuts out his conversation with the woman at the hotel desk, along with the opening credits.<br /><br />Also, The DVD release is presented in a \\"matted\\" 1.85:1 anamorphic wide screen transfer which adds black bars to the top and bottom of the movie's original full-frame (1.33:1) aspect ratio.<br /><br />I still bought the DVD, even though the edits take away 5 minutes of the movie. \\"It\\" on DVD is worth the purchase, if you ask me.
B000006ZDQ|5.0|Ronnie James Dio gave sabbath a much needed shot in the arm with this album!!!!! They had been sucking pretty bad, the few albums before Dio arrived, but they had just the right chemistry with the writing skill's and great voice of Ronnie. I just wish Ronnie would have stayed for more than two albums, but I heard that they had a blowup over the mixing problem they had with their &#34;Live Evil&#34; album.<br />Some say that side two was subpar to side one, but I respectfully disagree. I mean how can you go wrong with the like's of &#34;Walk away&#34;, &#34;Lonely is the word&#34;, &#34;Die young&#34;, and last but not least &#34;Wishing Well&#34;. Side two weak, that's crazy talk!!!!! On side one, I'm getting sick of &#34;Children of the Sea&#34;, and have never totally liked &#34;Lady evil&#34;, even though it's a decent song. But &#34;Heaven & Hell&#34;, and &#34;Neon Knights&#34;, are simply two of the greatest metal songs ever written!!! They just send chill's down my spine, every time I hear them!!!! I would recommend this as one of your first Sabbath purchases. ENJOY!!!
B000000W5B|4.0|Hey man,this album got me through alot of hangovers and rocked me through alot of party's so i have a warm place for it in my heart.  But despite my former drunken bias it still has a lot of merit to make it an essential purchase.  This tasty bowl of goat's head soup has some of the stones best rockers and a couple of ballads that aren't too shabby either.  \\"Star Star\\" is the stones at their raunchiest with a chuck berry riff that just grooves your soul and a chorus that would still shock the crap out of today's top 40 listening public.  You couldn't put this platter on radio without that station getting a hefty fee from the fcc.  You'll also find the funky whip crack rock menace of \\"Heartbreaker\\" with Jagger's vocals at their most biting and the soulful boogie romp of \\"100 years\\".  Now for the ballads you get the sexy sultry yearnings of \\"Angie\\" and the grand epic melodramatic sweep of \\"Winter\\".  As for the ballad that touches my soul the deepest you would have to crank up Keith's \\"Coming down again\\" because we've all been there and it ain't a fun place to be but Keith just makes it more bearable with his pure stripped to the bone naked emotion and his SOUL.  He is ROCK N\\" ROLL.  Anyway,enjoy this tasty bowl because it may not be on the leval of their greatest works but it's still a darn good album and that makes it better than most anything going down these days.  Well i'm off to the corner bar to make it another night and then to come home to come down again with good ol' Keith.  Keep the faith rock n' rollers.  Rock n' roll still lives.    O.F.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This time around after using the charmbraclet to get the formula back....Mariah emancipates herself as mimi to really give it to you this time around. She never really lost anything, but like many artists there is always a high and low point to your career. I think mariah had to change her singing style in order to not only keep it fresh but also not put wear and tear on a familar sound. In her early days Big ballads were more popular, and then after her \\"butterfly\\" album it went to midtempo, hip hop jams with only a few ballads here and there. <br />On this one she combines the two to not only create a fresh familar sound again.....but also show you why they say \\"Return of the Voice\\". Whats good? <br /> <br />*Its like that -- Hot club song...probably her best in a while  <br />*We belong together -- Ballad that sounds better with every live performance of it. <br /> <br />*Shake it off -- Hot beat with catchy message. <br />*Stay the night  -- Shes sings like crazy on this one. Really reminds you of the early days. <br /> <br />*Say something  - Hot new sound with the neptunes on this track. <br />*One and only - good collabo with twista. Reminds me a lil bit of the bone thugs song \\"break it down\\". <br />*Circles <br />*To the floor <br />*Joy Ride <br />*Fly like a bird <br />  <br /> <br />Overall these songs right here are the best of the bunch. Mariah returned to true form on this cd this time around by not only having the beats but also the tunes and \\"Voice\\" to match. I think whatever faith some had lost in her due to a few career moves and change in sound has been recaptured. With the first 2 singles still hot and a 3rd to drop soon I think its fair to say she made her stamp with this one. Fans and non - fans alike of good music need to get this ......and hear the \\"Emancipation fo Mimi\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Get it!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|This album is a fantastic work.  I give it 4 stars due to some of the lyrics.  Although the lyrics are sincere, they dance a little too close to \\"just plain stupid.\\"  The music, however, surpasses the previous albums by a huge margin.  I feel that the debut was a great album but Rush of Blood was filler (I can only find 2 good songs on Rush, 5 or 6 being complete throwaways).  By comparison, X&Y is quite consistent throughout.  It is difficult to decipher which songs will be chosen as singles because the whole record is uniformly excellent.  If they continue like this, they may have an impact equivalent to a fraction of U2.  However, if Coldplay want to become U2, Chris Martin better pick up a thesaurus.
0743490304|3.0|I have read Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons before I read Deception Point. Eventhough I still question the presence of the main characters in these books and eventhough the plots were very predictable, I enjoyed reading these books.<br />About Deception Point I can say that this is more or less the same thing.The reason that the main characters are where they are is simply implausible. The plot is very predictable and you can even see the \\"surprise\\" plot twist coming from a mile away.<br />The action that at first was exciting became very overdone after the characters became the prey of these special forces with their snowball-guns. In how much trouble can you get, even in a book? What became very tiring was that every time they were safe, the next ordeal happened. And every time you think that it is impossible that things get worse, you're wrong, it can always get worse. Even until things are beyond credibility and become ludicrous, they still can get worse.<br />And something else, I can really do without the humorless comic sidekicks. If the story would have had any credibility, then this one-dimensional character Corky would have ruined it!<br />I was pleased that the first one-dimensional sidekick (Norah Mangor) died on the ice and I hoped that the exact same thing would happen to the second one (Corky Marlinson) too. Later I hoped that pissing on his wounded leg didn't help in any way but would attract the sharks even more. But no, he survived and stayed the village idiot until the end, even in the White House.<br />But after having said all this, and knowing all the flaws and unbelievable things in the book. I still enjoyed it. Even after shouting \\"No Way!\\" a couple of times while reading, I kept reading the book. I enjoyed the way Dan Brown described the press conference with the switched envelopes.<br />And what I enjoyed was the fact that after the main characters Rachel and Michael seemed so perfect the whole time, they are not so perfect after all. He has a very infantile sense of humour (Whoohoo, I'm the ghost of Abe Lincoln!) and she is just a trashy slut, wanting to f**k the first time she spends a night in the White House with somebody she knows for less than 24 hours.<br /><br />Conclusion: I know that Deception Point isn't a good book, but still I enjoyed it. I sometimes enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons like hoping an annoying character gets killed. And sometimes I enjoyed it like I enjoy a whopper or a John McTiernan movie, you know it isn't very good, but you still want to eat, see or read it.ense of humour (Whoohoo, I'm the ghost of Abe Lincoln!) and she is just a trashy slut, wanting to f**k the first time she spends a night in the White House with somebody she knows for less than 24 hours.

B00005JNJT|5.0|This version of the Batman chronicles is by far the absolute best performance! The messages alone in the storyline are enough to earn this film five plus stars.<br />Christian Bale defines Batman with his amazing acting ability. He is an excellent actor with obvious skill.<br />The kids will be dazzled by the action in this movie and the adults will love it for its all-encompassing portrayal of Batman's life and passion for justice!<br />Go and see it on the big screen, you will not be sorry!!
B00005QIPH|5.0|this is a really good cd, one of my favorites.  most people won't give their music a second chance.  it is something special, different and unique.  just because a bands decides to stray from the same pop radio you hear every day, doesn't mean its bad.
0064471837|5.0|This book is the kind of book that only comes along every so often. This is the sort of book to keep you up all night reading when you have school the next day and several tests to take. You won't even care because it is definatley worth staying up all night to finish it.<br /><br />Sabreil creates a totally unique and new world unlike any other book I've read. The idea behind it is that there are nine gates and stages of Death and untill you have reached the ninth gate you are not truly dead and a necromancer can bring you back as an evil spirit and enslave your soul. A person called the Abhorsen is like a necromancer but puts spirits to rest and dispells evil spirits.<br /><br />Sabriel's father is the Abhorsen but when he goes missing she must become the new Abhorsen and she sets out to find him. She joins her companions Mogget and Touchstone and they set out to find Sabriel's father.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book and although I was dubious while reading it in the beginning I was soon hooked and it is one of my favorite books now. You may think that you son't like fantasy and will not like this book but it has something to offer to everybody and I encourage you to read it.
B00007GZQI|4.0|Few films come along that I watch and say \\"Yeah, that's exactly right.  That's exactly how I feel.\\"  The Magic Christian is one of them.  Its a perfect satire of our culture and perfectly relevant today as it was then.  Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr are well-suited to each other in this off-kilter satire of a billionaire looking for everyone's \\"price\\".  Why?  To prove a point.  To punish as well as teach.<br /><br />Some may disagree with me, but I think the movie outdoes the book by some miles.  (...)  In fact, we have TV shows dedicated to just this fact.  Don't people eat bugs on Fear Factor or Survivor?  Do horrendously awful things for that all-mighty dollar?  Yes.<br /><br />Sir Guy Grand, a grand guy (Sellers), and his adopted son Youngman Grand (Starr) commit the ultimate heresy by faking a gigantic luxury liner for the cream of society only to mess with their heads with gorillas, Christopher Lee in full Dracula gear, and Yul Brenner in drag singing \\"Mad about the Boy\\" to Roman Polanski.  In short, this film is dangerous and brilliant.<br /><br />(PS to the reviewer who mentions the Beatles.  John isn't in it, its a double ... and Paul isn't singing, he just wrote the song for Badfinger.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't give it a five for two reasons.  1.  Much of the dialogue is ADR'd and Sellers can't give quite the subtle performance he might have done ala Strangelove (another Southern writing project.)  2.  The DVD is pretty much a slap-dash full screen copy of the crappy version that was out on VHS for years.  I hope one day they put out a good version.
1573223026|2.0|I will start out with the positive. I liked the idea of the book. That 4 strangers will meet at a crossroads, all there for the same reason, and decide not to kill themselves. It was a creative idea and that pulled me into the story.<br /><br />Martin has screwed up his life. He had a TV show, a wife, and kids. One false move and he lands in prison.<br /><br />Maureen has never had a life of her own since Matty was born. He basically has to be looked after 24/7 and Maureen can't handle it anymore.<br /><br />Jess is young, lonely, and has recently been rejected by her newest guy. Her family life isn't the best either.<br /><br />JJ's band has never worked out, and he and his girlfriend aren't together anymore. That was the whole reason he came to London.<br /><br />All of these characters end up at Topper's House, the place where people go to jump off the roof and kill themselves. They become each other's guardian angels, so to speak. They will be there for each other and start their therapy sessions then and there.<br /><br />They make a point not to do it till a month later on Valentine's Day. Will it happen? Or will they grow as people, find their happiness elsewhere, and learn to live with the cards life dealt them?<br /><br />Though it seems that there were a lot of positive reviews for this book, I never really got into it. I was about halfway through when I realized it, and I didn't want to give up on it, because it's happened before that the ending completely changes a book for me. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here. I love Nick Hornby's books, and I will continue to buy/check out/read everything he puts out, but I wish I had enjoyed this one more.
B000002U82|2.0|This is rather boring shyza I must say and may I also add in that it is overrated. If you want truly good old music look somewhere else. Rush and the Beatles smoke the pants of these tards.
0743424425|5.0|Seriously, this is Stephen King at his peak. You all know the story, so there is no need for a summary as so many good reviews supply. But, as I am running short, I'll give you this: <br />Don't read this alone.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|All I heard for months before I saw this movie was how great and funny it is.  For the longest time I didn't see it because I saw the commercials and it didn't look interesting in the least bit...add on to that every stupid quote from this movie everyone and their brother kept spewing and it didn't really fuel my desire to watch it.  Finally my brother went out and bought the DVD.    What a complete and utter waste of my time.    I wanted to shut it off less than twenty minutes into it, but I kept watching it hoping that something...ANYTHING...would be in the least bit funny.  Never happened.  However, there were several times when someone started to say something that sounded like it was about to be kind of funny...but then the movie would cut to something else.    The movie isn't even slightly entertaining, either...it's dull and pointless.  There's no plot at all, horrible acting, and all the main characters act EXACTLY the same...dull and emotionless, with absolutely no distinction between them.    I don't know...maybe I just don't get the humor, but to me, watching some clod with a squint breathe heavily into the camera after saying some stupid thing that everyone's going to repeat while his effeminate brother and sleazy uncle sell Tupperware doesn't really tickle my funnybone much.    This movie is called a \\"deadpan\\" comedy?  No.  Monty Python is deadpan humor.  Leslie Nielson is deapan humor.  This movie is devoid of anything even remotely resembling humor of any kind.  Basically, this movie is what you get when a lot of really untalented people get together and make a comedy without really trying.    I think this movie was trying to pioneer a new style of comedy...and I really hope it doesn't catch on.  I don't think I could handle another movie like this without assaulting anyone and everyone who had anything to do with it.    I heard people say that they didn't even know what was happening most of the movie because they were laughing so hard.  I, however,spent most of the movie trying to suppress the burning rage that it caused me for being so damn unsatisfying.    This movie sucks.
B000000JO3|5.0|You've got it all on this record; the fantastic Complete Discograph by Minor Threat (well, your missing the demo tapes, but you don't really need them) <br />The CD opens with the blazing 'Filler' followed closely by the aggressive 'I Don't Wanna Hear It.' Most of the songs up to 'Steppin' Stone' are in this same style of angry, fast punk. The highlights of this section of the album are: <br /> <br />'Straight Edge' <br />'Minor Threat' <br />'Out of Step (With the World)' <br /> <br />However all the tracks from this section are unbelievably good. <br />After this the album \\"slows\\" down somewhat; still fast, but a bit slower and less agressive. To the end of the album the highlights are: <br /> <br />'No Reason' <br />'Cashing In'  <br />'Betray' <br />'Salad Days' <br /> <br />Really this album is among the greatest hardcore albums ever recorded. I don't know why your interested in hardcore and don't own this album; you must be insane or something. <br /> <br />This album along with 'Bad Brains - Bad Brains' and 'Black Flag - Damaged' are the definitive hardcord records. So hurry up and buy them!
B0002I831S|3.0|As a Star Trek fan, I enjoyed this boxset for the sole reason that it contained all the episodes from the first season of the original Star Trek.  The package is good and the booklet inside gives not only the summary of the episodes, but some interesting information regarding technology and aliens in Star Trek.   <br /> <br />However, the price is ungodly high. This set is listed at $129.99 for eight discs, where the list price for the first season of CSI is $84.98 for six. <br /> <br />Because of the price, the Star Trek boxsets are really only for people who absolutely love Star Trek.  Not many people outside of hardcore fans of the franchise will be willing to pay what is asked for these things.  I'm a big Star Trek fan and I had a problem paying what I did for the two boxsets I bought.  If Paramount would drop the list price down to maybe $60 or $70 they'd probably pull a much larger profit...and leave consumers happier. <br /> <br />(This review goes for all other Star Trek boxsets as they are all listed at at least $129.99 - and most containing seven discs)
B0009AM5JA|3.0|The mix of this record is so forward it is obviously designed for radio play, the bright, forward and overly sibilant vocals just overwhelming.  In conjunction with the anthemic nature of the songs it makes one wonder if commercial considerations took precedence over the artistic.<br />Somewhat disappointing, this band can do better.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space...I knew before I even watched it that it was just a spoof and not to be taken seriously...but wow...just wow.  I liked this movie, but...it's retarded.  I mean it's ninety minutes of pure stupidity...which should be downright obvious to anyone with a nervous system.  I thought it was a fun movie...but definitely dumb fun.  Take an hour and a half out of your life to lose some IQ points with this movie.  You might not regret it.

End of discussion.\\" <br /> <br />Thrash has never been mainstream, so yeah, they are where they belong while METALLICA belongs on MTV along with the other NU-METAL and mainstream crap.

0060507772|4.0|All the Discworld novels I have read have been good and well worth my time.  The Last Hero is no exception.  People who are just starting to read Discworld shouldn't start off with this particular book, though.  You need to be well aquainted with the series to understand some things.<br /><br />The book, although short, had a great story and a lot of humor in it...seeing as how this is a Discworld book, neither one of those things is any big surprise.<br /><br />What sets this Discworld book apart from all the rest is the illustrations.  They are very well done and really help to add to the story.<br /><br />Another great book in the Discworld series.
B00007AJGH|5.0|There have been many movies and television shows that have tried to replicate the premise of 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, yet even the most recent attempts have, for the most part, failed (although Greg the Bunny came pretty close).  In the world of WFRR, cartoons, or just toons for short, are real.  They live among us, and act in their own movies and cartoons.  They just happen to be animated.  For the most part, the whole point of being a toon is to make people laugh, and many of them excel at it. <br />Dateline: Hollywood, 1947.  Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a down-and-out private investigator who has become a drunk grouch ever since the death of his brother and partner, Teddy.  The pair specialized in toon cases (they cleared Goofy of espionnage charges), and frequented Toontown, an animated city that was home to the toons.  That is until a deranged toon killed Teddy and left Eddie for dead.  Now, Eddie can barely find work, and spends most of his time drinking.  Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleisher) is an up-and-coming toon, the new star of Maroon Cartoons shorts.  Although lately, he has been having trouble with his lines.  Studio boss R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) believes that it is the fault of Roger's wife Jessica (Kathleen Turner/Amy Irving), a stunning redhead whom Maroon believes is cheating on her husband.  Maroon hires Eddie to trail Jessica and take pictures incriminating her.  It turns out that Jessica is doing something outside of her marriage (though not what you'd think) with Maroon's buddy Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), the CEO of the company that makes all of those gadgets that Wile E. Coyote tries to use against the Road Runner.  When Roger finds out, he is heartbroken, and the next day, Acme is found murdered.  Immediately, Roger is blamed, and the man with jurisdiction over Toontown, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is set to execute Roger without even a trial.  His new invention, dip (comprised of turpentine, acetone, and benzene), is the only provenway to actually kill a toon, and he has no qualms about using it on Roger. <br />Roger claims that he is innocent, and begs Eddie to help him out.  He originally declines, but he is eventually drawn into the case.  And what seems like a simple frame job continues to unfold as more and more clues point in new directions. <br />For what may be seen as a kids' movie (which it definitely isn't), there is a complex story, interesting character development, and good dialogue.  Also, the special effects are superb, espcecially considering that this movie was made in 1988.  The toons are integrated nearly seamlessly into the real world and vice versa.  Also, this is probably the ONLY time anyone will ever see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny interacting with each other.  There were probably loads of conditions that had to be met by both Disney and Warner Bros. to make that happen, and due to studio politics, will probably never happen again. <br />Overall, this is a great movie that is a testament to the talents of director Robert Zemeckis (who also directed Back to the Future and Castaway) as well as the effects team.  We will probably never get another movie like this.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|The movie is too twisted here and there, the peoples are pretty only on the surface, the insides are complex and rotten. <br />But the thing that you will not see in any other movie is Clive Owen shouting : \\" I am a caveman \\", he is sooo sexy, a dark and handsome caveman and doctor (no less) all wrapped in one, the women's dream out there. For Clive Owen women fans, that scene was worthy the whole movie.
080013558X|1.0|Doesn't matter whether I am able to sing or not. I sang in the Chicago Children's Choir at the age of the actress and I am well familiar with tone, pitch, and delivery. The original 1977 Tony Award Winning musical Starring Andrea McArdle was simply magnificant!! McArdle is a child genius with an above average voice. She could carry the demands of an Alto and Aileen Quinn basically could not whatsoever!! What I cannot stomach is that so damned many people creamed over this film. It was over-budgeted and awful and as a former star myself; it was made for the pure driven desire of the almighty dollar. The Only reason an Oscar was nominated is because this was one of Houston's last musicals before his death and many of you really are not aware of how Hollywood is so very political in the decision making that goes into nominations and clout. I so very agree with the other (very few) appreciative viewers who have compared the stage version to the film version in that the spirit of Art and Talent just was not there. Finney tried the hardest to make this work and why in the heck would Houston remove the best scores from the original Broadway smash. Talent is very hard to come by and for anything to work; one musn't be so inspired about the money alone. The best films were made by the conviction of the artist. I mean CHICAGO was THE BEST adaptation and can you see the difference? I am glad that it was made for children but to take it seriously as a Oscar Winner is just plain ridiculous. Why do you think that you can purchase the movie for .98!! Great for those who have NO musical background and derive the simplicity of ...well..whatever. But many of you who disagree..OH Well, I disagree with you too and I am not writing this to please you at all. For those who TRULY understand what I mean; Hats off to YOU!!
B000002AH7|5.0|The end of a six year span of seemingly endless productivity, innovation, and brilliance on the part of Miles Davis, \\"Sketches of Spain\\" may well be the single best recording to bear his name.  After he completed it, he claimed to have had nothing left, and indeed, this may have been the case, for the next several years, Davis existed in a creative vacuum, sticking largely to the same songbook and not moving into anything new until a new quintet struck inspiration (but that's a story for another day). <br /> <br />The third in a series of collaborations with arranger Gil Evans featuring Miles soloing over a big band-- 20 pieces this time-- mostly brass (10) and reeds (5), but also harp, bass, drum kit, and two percussionists-- \\"Sketches of Spain\\" is an exploration of the \\"Spanish tinge\\" in jazz.  The backing consists of delicate dynamic twists and turns, castinets offsetting reeds, a harp for color, and brass fanfares.  It is probably the most complex of Evans' arrangements for Miles, and the parts he wrote for the soloist were brutal.  Miles rose to the challenge, influsing the music with a passion and pained sound that is unmistakably him. <br /> <br />Highlights are too numerous to tell, although certainly the lengthy \\"Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)\\" is the most noticable.  And even though composer Joacquin Rodrigo disliked it, it is a piece filled with such a lively energy and unnerving power that I find it utterly compelling (oddly enough, when I heard Rodrigo's original score, I found it somewhat lifeless).  The other piece worthy of special mention is \\"Saeta\\", with a march opening and closing and a several minute unaccompanied solo by Davis of such enormity and power that the human cries he sought to evoke (\\"the heroine mourning over the fallen bullfighter\\" as Evans termed it) are completely clear. <br /> <br />This remaster features pristine sound that is crisp, clean, and most importantly not too bright for the music, and augments the precedings with another piece from the same session (\\"Song of Our Country\\") and a couple alternates.  All in all, its is a masterpiece start to finish.  Essential listening for any jazz fan, casual or otherwise.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" transformed the film experience for all of us. Before \\"Jaws\\" there was no summer blockbusters to entice viewers into a dark movie theater during the care free days of hot, cloudless days. That changed when Steven Spielberg made it scary to go into the water. Basically combining \\"Moby Dick\\" with a monster movie, \\"Jaws\\" continues to be one of the best films Spielberg directed and one of his most suspenseful. I'm giving 5 stars to the original film. So many people downgrade these releases because of issues they have with the manufacturing or marketing and that's unfair to readers who need to know if the movie is worthwhile.<br /><br />The plot (if you don't need a recap skip this paragraph):--A Great White Shark patrols the waters off the coast of the summer beach town of Amity feeding on people at random. Police chief Broady (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and city council refuse to do so only allowing him to put up a beach patrol and then putting out a bounty on the shark's head. Feeding season is open and Brody along with Shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and fisherman and shark hunter Quint (the terrific Robert Shaw)must face the creature far from land out in the open ocean in an effort to kill this rogue shark.<br /><br />First the bad news--this doesn't look like it's been remastered to me although the picture is a tiny bit sharper with slighly better resolution it isn't the huge difference I expected. Universal did it right the first time. The original theatrical trailers that were on the first DVD issue are missing as well. Since they were an important part of the success of the film and they were GREAT trailers, I would love to have them here as well.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for Jaws looks positively stunning which helps intensify the experience. Painstakingly restored from the original negative and audio multitracks, the film has never looked quite as good on home video. Heck, I doubt it looked this good in theaters at the time. Colors pop and the film has considerably more depth and detail than previously. Textures are quite good as well.<br /><br />The audio sounds stunning as well with an immersive lossless mix that puts you in the action. It also isn't in your face like many contemporary audio mixes for films.<br /><br />The special features as with the previous edition on DVD includes deleted scenes. We also get the full length documentary \\"The Shark Isn't Working\\" which gives us first hand stories from the late Scheider (who narrated), Richard Dreyfus, the late producers and Spielberg discussing the challenges of making the movie including the fact that it was one of the first films actually shot on the ocean and not on a backlot. The title of the documentary refers to the delicate nature of \\"Bruce\\" the mechnical shark--the designer didn't have time to test the shark because of the shooting schedule and due to the erosion that occurred in the salt water it would often break down. As co-producer Richard Zanack points out almost all the footage that was shot where the shark was working was used simply because they didn't have that much to work with in the first place. The documentary also includes an interview with the late Peter Benchley who discussed his expectations of his first novel including the fact that it wouldn't sell (because back then first novels rarely did), wouldn't be made into a movie (because he felt the technology didn't exist to show what he had imagined at the time)and it would quickly be forgotten. He was happy to be wrong on all accounts.<br /><br />We also get \\"The Making of 'Jaws'\\" the two hour documentary from the previous DVD set imported over as well as all the material (as far as I can tell) from the previous deluxe two DVD edition.<br /><br />We also get a DVD copy of the movie as well as the option to stream via Ultraviolet or watch via iTunes via download.<br /><br />One of Spielberg's finest films receives a nice, deluxe edition onBlu-ray and is well worth picking up. \\"Jaws\\" may have a slight wrinkle or two but this is probably one of the best digital facelifts that a film has received in recent memory.<br /><br />Highly recommended.Blu-ray and is well worth picking up. \\"Jaws\\" may have a slight wrinkle or two but this is probably one of the best digital facelifts that a film has received in recent memory.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000002AGM|5.0|In the mid-50s, Miles Davis switched record lables, beginning a long association with Columbia Records (thirty years to be exact).  In addition to his recordings with his working band, Columbia had loftier goals for him, encouraging him to record in a big band setting, kind of a \\"Birth of the Cool plus\\" sort of thing, with Gil Evans arranging backdrops for Miles to solo over.  This resulted in one of the most powerful collaborations in the history of jazz, with \\"Miles Ahead\\" being the first. <br /> <br />Featuring ten tracks, mostly covers with a couple originals thrown in, Evans constructs a dark, deep, romantic, and melancholy sound for Miles to solo over-- the eighteen piece orchestra (twelve brass, four reeds, bass and drums) manages a stunning array of textures and colors and highlights.  For his part, Miles seems particularly inspired, soloing exclusively on the flugelhorn, a somewhat larger variant of the trumpet that exists in the same frequency range but produces a somewhat dark sound. <br /> <br />The thing that really stands out about \\"Miles Ahead\\" (and indeed all the Miles/Gil collaborations) is that everything is quite good.  There are standouts, but I suspect this is largley subjective.  Miles seems particularly inspired by the brilliant arrangement of \\"The Maids of Cadiz\\" and the piece turns into a melancholy lament of seemingly endless beauty. \\"My Ship\\" is filled with a beautiful sense of sentimentality and longing that really transcends being written.  There's so much, but for me, the highlight really is \\"I Don't Wanna Be Kissed (By Anyone But You\\").  The melody line played by Davis is a skittering, almost nervous and tense, almost like being afraid to ask a girl out-- its really the only way I can describe it (speaking as a horn player, its also frighteningly difficult, but that's besides the point).  Miles solos after this with brilliance and power as the piece builds in mood to a heightened sense of ecstacy, punctuated by an absolutely stunning lead trumpet voice from the orchestra wailing above.  Absolutely stunning. <br /> <br />But ask someone else, they'll name three other tracks.  It's all quite good.  Add to this a crisp, clean sound courtesy of remastering and a handful of alternate takes, and you've got an essential recording.  What's frightening is that as good as this is, \\"Sketches of Spain\\" (the third Miles/Gil collaboration) is probably better, but this is something that should be in everyone's collection.  Highly recommended.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|If you're looking for speed metal or death metal (similar to what it sounds like the reviewer C. Sanchez \\"VicRattlehead02\\" (North Bergen, NJ USA) is into), then this is NOT an ablum for you.  I'd guess by his name that he's into Megadeth...like I USED to be...but then again, when did Dave & crew put out a listenable album??  If you appreciate GOOD music, then this album will have you listening over and over and BLOWING out your speakers with volume.  One reviewer likened Clutch's performance on RH:E to \\"The Allman Brothers meets Galactic meets Corrosion of Conformity\\" and they couldn't have been more dead on.<br /><br />There's enough funk (with the addition of a new full time Hammond keyboardist), enough blues (lot's of slide on here as usual), and enough POWER to satisfy anyone's summertime beer guzzling out door festivities.  Clutch's trademark tempo changes are there...the growling vocals...thundering rhythm section...it's bad ass.<br /><br />I purchased the album Sat. night and believe that my girlfriend and I have listened to it close to 10 times already.  Yesterday we had it on repeat as we grilled out and worked on things around the house (her doing some canvas work, me doing other things).  There were at least a dozen times when we both dropped what we were doing and went and found each other with looks of amazement and just HOW good this album is.<br /><br />Will Clutch break throug to the mainstream and general radio play with this album?  Hell no - the general population of America doesn't have that good of taste.....and that's just fine with me.  General America can have their crap - I'll keep my Clutch.<br /><br />One thing I do guarantee is coming Clutch's way with this album is some LONG overdue critical acclaim from music critics though.  It's just THAT good.

B000001DQI|5.0|My rock and roll musical friends and I spent many hours debating the relative merits of bands that relied more heavily on guitar (Skynyrd, Allman Bros, Zeppellin, etc) vice those that featured piano (Winwood, Billy Joel, etc.) As a pianist it wasn't difficult to categorize Elton John by those simple criteria, but \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" always stood above the rest of his albums - both for the songs written by Bernie Taupin and for the performances, which featured strong guitar riffs along with Elton's pounding piano.<br /><br />Some of these songs now seem perhaps overexposed (Candle in the Wind comes to mind following Princess Diana's funeral), but this album begins rocking with the segue between \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" and the guitar-driven \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\", and there's hardly a let-up in sight.  The title song is an absolute classic, and it joins \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" and \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" among the top of the Rock and Roll canon.<br /><br />If someone who hadn't heard a note of rock and roll wanted to find out about Elton John - I'd sit them down and put on \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".  The Amazon review says that GYBR is \\"Rarely mentioned as one of the great double albums\\", but I would disagree.  Among musicians I know it is OFTEN mentioned as one of the great albums - period.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|I know a lot of people out there these days buy television shows on DVD in order to watch them at their leisure - and commercial-free, so for those of you planning to pick up season 2 of the OC here is a quick recap of what to expect.    The season opener commences a few months after the finale from season 1 - with Ryan living in Chino with pregnant Teresa and Seth living 'abroad' after his impromptu sailing expedition.  Back home things are on the messy side...Kirsten is depressed, Sandy is frustrated, and Summer and Marissa still aren't over their missing boys, at least not entirely.    As you might have guessed, the OC wouldn't exist without Seth & Ryan and yes they do return...but that doesn't mean everything is rosy.  A crop of new characters enter and exit the OC social scene throughout the season, which is no longer marked by extravagant parties and constant fist fights.    Most of the turmoil from this season comes from ever-changing relationships between ALL of the characters, including the adult leads.  Trysts, affairs, triangles, experimenting, questionable behaviour, fights, frustrations and secret (and not-so secret) crushes dominate this much more intricate season - and yet there are still many more questions to be answered in the coming season.    Some of the new characters include teenagers Zach, Lindsay, and Alex, as well as adults Rebecca, Carter, Lance, and Reed, and the return of Ryan's older brother, Trey.  A few highlights of the season include the \\"The SnO.C.\\", \\"The Chrismakkah That Almost Wasn't\\", \\"The Power of Love\\", \\"The Rainy Day Women\\", and the last three or four episodes.    Altogether this is a strong season of the OC when looked back on, but it's missing a lot of one element that really propelled the show forward in it's first season - fun.  The stand-alone \\"fun\\" episodes seem out of place and unrealistic, and many of the storylines are much heavier and more depressing then what occured in the first season.  Still if you've watched thefirst season of the oc there is no doubt you will be clamoring to watch the second - so don't pass it up, it's still a great show overall.  Amusingly even Seth comments on how \\"last year was so much better\\" in the episode \\"The Blaze of Glory\\".  True that - but the OC still thrills viewers and produces laughs, and I personally am looking forward to a new season.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is one of the most original and well done movies I've ever seen.

Go on over to Amazon.co.uk and by the 2 disc version.  It's a little more but well worth it.  Oh, and please don't by this movie just because it says it has Tarantino's approval, Tarantino hasn't done a good film since...hmmm...has he ever done a good film?

The people of Nanking were beaten to death, raped to death, stabbed, bayoneted, shot and burned alive in an atrocity sanctioned by and carried out under the orders of the Japanese Army and the Militarist government of Japan. The Japanese government has refused to accept responsibilty for this horror to this very day.

B0000E5NPZ|5.0|Panned at the time of its release, \\"Bonjour Tristesse\\" stands up today as one of the more stylish and less hokey 1950's treatments of teenage angst & sexuality in changing times (it's more commercial counterpart would be the saccharine \\"A Summer Place\\" with Sandra Dee). Shot almost entirely on location at a villa on the French Riviera, director Otto Preminger's camera often encircles it subjects, follows them straight through rooms, up stairs and around porches, until you get a panoramic sense of really being there with the characters amidst the beautiful scenery. There's a sense of perpetual movement in the camerawork that makes \\"Bonjour\\" worth studying for its innovative cinematography alone.<br /><br />Adding to the eye-candy factor is star Jean Seberg in her second film and second collaboration with Preminger (their first being the disastrous \\"Saint Joan\\" of the year before). Jean caught a lot of flack from skeptics who criticized her performance as \\"wooden\\" and \\"stilted\\", bedgrudging her rapid ascent to leading-lady status after having been picked from obscurity to play Joan of Arc.  Preminger's \\"search for Joan\\" contest was not unlike today's \\"American Idol\\", with the instant success (and resentment) that its \\"winners\\" experience. On his TV show, Mike Wallace grilled her mercilessly about whether or not she thought she deserved to star in anything, firing accusatory statements at her like \\"you are a synthetic star\\", \\"your debut was a failure...what are you going to do if you fail again? What will it take for you to pack up your bags and go home?\\"  As it happened, Jean met both Wallace's hostility and the challenges of \\"Bonjour Tristesse\\" with her customary good grace.<br /><br />As Cecile, Jean adeptly essays a teenage girl, sweet of temperament but disporportionately enamored of her widowed father, played by David Niven. Cecile plots and schemes--with disastrous results--to eliminate Anne (Deborah Kerr) as  the competition for his affections.<br /><br />Compelling by her looks alone--dimpled and aglow with youth (and a decidedly  lucky bone structure), Seberg nonetheless does more than just trade on her beauty--she carves something interesting from a character that could easily have been bland.

B000929AJQ|2.0|So I heard the track \\"bite the hand that feeds\\" a few weeks before I actually bought this album. I was apprehensive since it didn't really stike me as very good, but after several friends telling me this was very much like Pretty Hate Machine (my favourite NIN album) I broke down and bought it. It would be an understatement to say I was dissapointed. First of all this is nothing like PHM. PHM in it's day (and to still today) was unique, and in it's way innovative (though there were many other industrial acts that we much more innovative even at the time...ahem Skinny Puppy). This album is not innovative. At all. Well you may say that with PHM Trent was exposing his soul on the album. I would agree, and say that even up to The Fragile he was.  But this album just doesn't feel that way (save a few tracks which I'll get to in a minute). It feels like he's playing to angry 14-year-olds, and that's it. Now before everyone gets their panties in a twist I don't expect the person someone is today to be the same person they were 16 years ago, nor do I expect artists to keep doing the same thing over and over again. But with the first 3 albums you could really feel his evolution both as a person and as an artist. And even though The Fragile was not my favourite NIN album I loved it because it was innovative; it was pushing the boundaries; and it had moments of intense beauty, and intense ugliness. I respected that he was (for better or worse) pushing himself as an artist. But I digress...Most of the album sucks. I hate to say it, but it does. There is only one song that is the caliber of what NIN used to produce (\\"everyday\\"); relatively speaking \\"bite the hand that feeds\\" & 'only' (despite its horrible elcrto-clash beat) are standouts on the album. The rest of it is worthy of the trash can and that's it.

I am glad my father told me the wonders of this flick, because I watch my DVD copy about twice a year and love it more each time I enter the world this magical film conveys.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I have been a HUGE fan of Clutch from my first listen of TSL back in 1993 and with each release since.  There have been albums I loved such as S/T and Elephant Riders and albums I liked such as PRF or Jam Room.  I can't find one thing wrong with this album.  Each time I listen to it I find a new favorite song and keep hitting repeat while I'm out doing errands.  The additon of the Hammond Organ is pure genius and makes for a richer, fuller sound.  There are people who say all Clutch songs sound the same...but the same could be said for Tom Petty or Aerosmith or The Rolling Stones or countless hundreds of other bands.  The thing that sets Clutch apart isn't that all their songs sound the same its that none of their songs sound like anyone else.  You can keep your Good Charlotte, Maroon 5 or whatever else is popular this week....gimme Clutch and lots of it.

B0007Z4S4C|1.0|I am always leary about old rockers putting out new material. I have been a Robert Plant fan for years but this album really shows Plant's age. I really don't like the fact that he changes band members every couple of albums either. The 80's and 90's were Plant's best years.  I really don't care for Plant's new style of music.  I prefer the \\"Principle of Moments\\" and \\"Now and Zen\\" type of music.  This music would be great if I was traveling through a jungle or visiting Africa. Not good, save your money. Purchase some of Plant's earlier projects if you want to hear some good music.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|This is a great compilation of 23 of some of the Pixies greatest songs.   This is well worth it and I think the Pixies are one of the greatest indie influences of the past 18 years or so. What I love about the Pixies is that they are different, eclectic, and awesome to watch live.  They shorten their songs somewhat when they are live.    Every song on this CD is a great example of what makes the Pixies so great and so different from what else is out there right now. Their songs are eccentric, witty, and melodic. They are not full of fluff that gets featured on Top 40 radio. Kim Deal and Frank Black are awesome and have influenced many, many bands. Check them out live if you ever get the chance. They will not disappoint. This CD is a great place to start if you are unfamiliar to the Pixies. It really has some great songs like \\"Monkey's Gone to Heaven\\", \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Nimrods Son\\", \\"The Holiday Song\\", \\"U-Mass\\", and \\"Dig For Fire.\\"  Good thing about the Pixies is that they are still kinda obscure to most people and you can pick up their CD's really cheap. I don't think some people really get them, but they are a brilliant band.

Powerslave was one of the first Maiden CDs I bought (Yes, CD, I wasn't born when this album was released) and its a great way to get into the band. <br /> <br />I think it was because of the many rave reviews of this album that I chose to start with it. I would advise budding Iron Maiden fans to do the same; Powerslave is a chronicle of a band at its creative peak, while Iron Maiden produced many more excellent albums before and after Powerslave, IMHO, Powerslave was perhaps the most excellent (all Iron Maiden albums are of a very high standard, it really comes down to personal preference whether you prefer Powerslave, Piece of Mind, Number of the BEast, Somewhere in Time etc overall) <br /> <br />There's something in this CD to show off the many sides of maiden. Aces High is a fast, very catchy rocker that was the first Iron Maiden song (along with Hallowed be Thy Name) that I ever heard (on a friend's 'Best of the Beast' CD). Its a good intro to the band. Not as good live though, I think Bruce finds it hard to repeat the dazzling vocal performance on the album itself; listen to it and you won't be surprised... <br /> <br />2 Minutes to Midnight is another awesome song; great at parties, particularly when you inform your mates that it really is 23:58, and they'll either think you're a weirdo, or start singing the song. Perhaps the best Smith/Dickinson collaboration <br /> <br />Losfer Words (Big Orra), despite its weird title, is a good instrumental. Some fans view this song negatively; perhaps its more appealing if you're a musician and can appreciate the musical intricacies. But its a great tune. <br /> <br />Flash of the Blade is a song loosely based on Bruce's fencing experiences (but don't be deterred, its a great track), it features a cool guitar riff and some awesome vocal work <br /> <br />The Duellists is another 'fencing-style' song, which some believe to be the weakest song on the album. I can't understand that view, I personally love this song, particularly the clarity with which Bruce sings the chorus and verses. His voice is bloody good in this song. I don't think he could repeat it if he tried....great harmonised guitar in the middle too! <br /> <br />Next we come to 'Back in the Village', which I would call the weakest track. The chorus is fairly average, but the song is still a decent track. It certainly isn't 'bad' <br /> <br />Powerslave is an excelletn track, another Bruce original. It has an Egyptian sounding guitar riff, but the real highlight for me is the middle of the song, with an awesome harmonised guitar part and a great solo by (I think) Dave Murray. <br /> <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the real star of this album. some 15 minutes of pure quality; Maiden's longest song I believe.... Its based on the Coleridge poem, (not a short poem by any means) and the track is possibly the greatest iron maiden song. If I had to pick a favourite from their entire catalogue, I would pick this song. The moral of the poem is conveyed in such an honest way, with PERFECT guitar, drums and bass thrown in as well. It will make you want to do any poetry/English related school/University work on this poem, just so you can brag about the song. <br /> <br />Overall, Powerslave is the pinnacle of Iron Maiden's exceptional career. While you should buy EVERY album (possibly except No Prayer for the Dying), Powerslave is where you should start. <br /> <br />
0156027321|4.0|It is a memorable book, a combination of Robinson Crusoe, David Copperfield, Moby Dick, Old Man and the Sea, Mutiny on the Bounty all rolled into one with one big exception. It is uproariously funny, witty, chock full of bon mots, a delight to read. How can you not like a book where the protagonist is a 16 year old boy who is named Piscine by his swimmer uncle, who in turn calls himself pi to escape ridicule from his class mates? If I were his classmate I would have teased him by calling \\"Hey you, circumference over diameter, yes you.\\"<br /><br />It is really a incredible story of survival on the open Pacific Ocean in a life boat with as unimaginable companions as you can get, a 450 pound Bengal tiger, a hyena, a wounded giraffe and a female orangutan. It has to be a true story as no writer can dream of such \\"stranger than life\\" fiction. What does one do under these circumstances, leave the boat and jump in the Pacific or be ready to be petit dejeuner for the hungry tiger. But as luck would have it Pi grew up with animals as his father ran a Zoo in Pondicherry, India and it would take all his skill, his common sense and some luck thrown in for good measure to outwit the beast, the elements, not to mention his fears. Tiger may be the king of the jungle, but man is king of the world. A 450 pound tiger is no match for a puny 100 pound boy who can think and plan.
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden were really on the money in the 1980's; there isn't a single album that was released between 1980-1990 (and they released about 7 studio albums, not counting No Prayer) that is not worth five stars for its originality and orchestration. Many people consider Seventh Son to be Maiden's best ever; released in 1988. <br /> <br />I don't know if it's their best or not; to be honest I really can't pick a 'best', though Powerslave is my personal favourite. The instant you pick a 'best' album you find yourself saying 'but Powerslave.....but Piece of Mind.....but Somewhere in Time...' etc. You can't do it. BUT you can acknowledge that Seventh Son continues the string of masterpieces that this band managed to produce <br /> <br />I bought this album a few years ago, after already having heard Can I Play With Madness, and The Evil that Men Do, and the Clairvoyant on various live/best of albums. I can tell you, these songs almost sound better in the context of this 'concept' album. Even if you're familiar with those songs, there's no way you should bypass this album, for there are 8 tracks of pure quality on this CD with NOTHING resembling filler. <br /> <br />The album is very neatly tied together; Moonchild and Only the Good Die Young begin/end with the same 'seven deadly sins' poem. I'm not going to review every song other than to say that each song is unique and excellent to hear. On this album, Iron Maiden have continued the use of Synthesisers for sound enhancement, as began on Somewhere in Time. Don't think for a minute that this undermines the music itself though; it adds to the production and feel of the album. You'll still hear great musicianship from all the boys <br /> <br />This was Adrian Smith's last album with the boys for about 12 years; enjoy it, ironically I would agree that Iron Maiden don't make an album comparatively as good as this until Brave New World in 2000 (though I personally like the X Factor very much). This is also the last album until BNW in which Bruce sounds on the money; the following two see his voice more ragged and worn out; probably from vigorous touring and solo work in the early 90s. <br /> <br />Anyway, all songs on this album are excellent. My favourites are Infinite Dreams (I love the progression on this song; the lyrics are especially good, good old Steve doesn't let you down!) and the title track; (awesome lead guitar in the last few minutes of this epic song) <br /> <br />If you own any Iron Maiden albums you owe it to yourself to at least buy this one. If you don't own any and are just curious; perhaps start with Powerslave or Piece of Mind, but you can't really go wrong with Seventh Son. Just don't take it as indicative of their sound overall.
0375703764|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  Imagine the gene-spliced child of Umberto Eco, Jack Kerouac, the Amityville Horror, and the Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br />While the lowest layer of story is creepy enough, the multiple layers above it and the layout of the book itself add to the eerieness of the experience. <br /> <br />Caution: it takes some effort to read -- not for the casual King/Koontz set.
B000024D4R|5.0|Most people overlook this album, though I have no idea why; it certainly can't be due to any deficiencies in the album itself. Perhaps because it just wasn't 'as brilliant' as the albums that preceded and followed it (i.e. Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and the Wall). <br /> <br />Any fan of Pink Floyd should buy this album, it's delightfully cynical and Waters' social conscience is well represented in the lyrics. As you might expect from the album before the wall (well known as roger waters' baby), animals was recorded when rifts were starting to appear in the band. While this didn't effect the quality of the music, the credits reveal all songs are by waters, except Dogs, which is Waters and Gilmour. <br /> <br />The quality of music is really outstanding; I personally think Dogs is the best single song Pink Floyd ever did (perhaps Shine on or Echoes could be better...) it's about 20 minutes of epic music, with both Gilmour and Waters doing vocals. There's lots of wonderful guitar work (it's in D tuning for any guitarists out there) <br /> <br />But the album as a whole is breathtaking; Pigs (three different ones) is perhaps the most cynical; Waters' criticism of various public figures from late 70's England is very funny (Mary Whitehouse, Margaret Thatcher etc) <br /> <br />All in all, if you like Pink Floyd and appreciate their music as symphonic, you can't look past this album. BUY IT
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I thought Hell Freezes Over was one of the best concerts on DVD; this one tops it.  This concert includes solo hits by Don Henley (The Boys of Summer, All She Wants to Do is Dance, Dirty Laundry, Sunset Grill), Glenn Frey (You Belong to the City), and Joe Walsh (Funk #49, Life's Been Good,  Rocky Mountain Way), and some newer songs by the Eagles (Hole in the World, One Day at A Time). The one band member that was missing (and sorely missed) was Don Felder.  He has been replaced by a session guitarist Steart Smith.  Even though Smith plays the guitar solos very precisely and close to the versions on disc, I missed the nice guitar interplay and chemistry between Felder and Walsh that was in \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\"  There is a lot less chemistry between Stewart and Walsh.  <br /> <br />The highlight of this concert disc is Joe Walsh.  He is such an incredible guitarist and his guitar solos are impeccable.  On the solo on Hotel California at the end, he totally blows away the session guitarist.  Joe Walsh's solo songs and hits from James Gang days are a very welcome addition to this concert.   <br /> <br />What is also great in this disc are the inclusion of hits such as \\"The Long Run,\\" \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" \\"New Kid in Town,\\" \\"One of These Nights,\\" and \\"In the City.\\"  Hotel California is played very close to the album version, unlike the unplugged version on \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\"   <br /> <br />The DTS sound quality and the concert footage are just wonderful.  If you are an Eagles fan, this is a must-have, and it goes well on the shelf alongside \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\"  Highly recommended!!    <br /> <br />
B000063DI8|3.0|This is perhaps the weakest album that Iron Maiden has released; the album was released in 1990 after the hugely successful and very ambitious Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. <br /> <br />I'm not hard to please; but it isn't easy to give this album more than a 3. I'd give it a 3.5 if you could vote in halves, but I can't (or at least, don't know how) so it gets a 3 <br /> <br />IT isn't so much that this is a bad album; don't be led to think that it is. There are definitely some things to like on this album; I would rate the following songs as good: (a) holy smoke, (b) bring your daughter...., (c) tailgunner, (d) hooks in you, (e) run silent...run deep.  <br /> <br />The 'average' songs would be: (a) public enema number one, (f) mother russia, and (g) fates' warning.  <br /> <br />It pains me to classify any iron maiden song as worse than 'average' but I really have to; the track 'the assassin' is absolute tosh. I don't know what they were thinking with this track but it's absolute drivel. Thankfully they have never emulated this crapness, and they've given us many, many excellent songs, so they're easily forgiven. But don't do it again, guys! <br /> <br />But I digress, the album itself is not a bad album; its worth buying it, if only for completeness and to have a cd version of Holy Smoke, Bring your daughter...., and Hooks in You. These are ironically the most lighthearted songs on the CD; if you have a sense of humour you should like these songs. They aren't as serious or complicated as other Iron Maiden songs, but they're good fun. Incidentally if you get a chance, watch the Holy Smoke video. ITs the funniest thing I've ever seen (it features Dave Murray playing the solo up to his knees in water in a creek; Janick Gers is in a pool playing an inflatable guitar. Steve Harris plays on the back of a moving tractor...) <br /> <br />This is a much more watered down effort after Seventh Son and its synth-driven production. Adrian Smith has left the band and Janick Gersreplaced him. Think what you will of Janick, he had some big shoes to fill. Personally I think he's a good bloke; his songwriting took a while to get going, but his stuff on X Factor, and especially Brave New World/Dance of Death IMHO dispel any doubt about his contribution. <br /> <br />Bruce's voice is the most obvious difference on this CD. He does sound much less pure and awe-inspiring; he cackles more and strains in the higher register. I believe the Seventh Son tour, followed by Bruce's recent solo effort 'Tattooed Millionaire' wore him out physically and mentally. Consequently his voice was shot to pieces for this album, and it shows. BUT he is still an excellent singer, just don't expect the power you felt on 'Caught Somewhere in Time' or 'Aces High' <br /> <br />
B000001ELP|4.0|Music From the Elder was Kiss' first attempt to try and do something different.  The end results was \\"Music From the Elder\\".  Kiss needed some fresh musical blood and tried to go the Who route.  Stanley and Simmons envisioned a Tommy like sucess such as a possible movie and tour deal with Music From the Elder.  But the Kiss Army wasn't buying it and the critics slagged it.  After the failure of the album, Ace Frehley left and Simmons and Stanley were back to square one.<br /><br />The album itself is pretty good.  Producer Bob Ezrin sought help from former collaborator Lou Reed.  Reed provided input on a few songs.  Ace Frehley's work on the disc was limited to Dark Light.  A snappy song that could have become a huge hit.  The story is about a young warrior who must face many challenges before he becomes of age and<br /><br />lead his people to a new age of prosperity and defeat the forces of darkness.<br /><br />The music project was too ambitious for the average Kiss fan to take.  Many of them didn't understand the album's concept.  It's a shame because the music's really good.  Take a chance, sometimes you score, other times you might just crap out.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of concept music.
B000063DIH|4.0|Fear of the Dark is definitely a step forward (or is it backwards) to better things after the fairly mediocre NO Prayer for the Dying. Fear of the Dark was done in 1992, Bruce's last album with IRon Maiden until 2000, and its a decent, if not a great, album <br /> <br />The album contains a fair few good songs; be quick or be dead, from here to eternity, and judas be my guide are great rock songs. The former being one of the fastest songs Maiden have done. There are also some pretty good 'ballads' like Wasting Love (not wonderful but still good). Childhood's end is also good. <br /> <br />There is also a reasonable amount of average material. Weekend Warrior, Fear is the Key, the Fugitive, the Apparition, Chains of Misery, are all fairly average songs. They aren't harsh on the ear, and offensive like the craptacular 'Assassin' on NO Prayer for the Dying, but they don't jump out at you like Maiden tracks should and usually do <br /> <br />But what makes the album a good addition to your collection are two songs; fear of the dark and afraid to shoot strangers. Despite the weird title on the latter, it's a very original maiden track, with some nice sombre singing from Bruce and some timeless harmonised guitar riffs. <br /> <br />The title track is what No Prayer sorely missed; an epic song in the vein of 'Seventh Son' or 'To Tame a Land'. It is an instant fan favourite and an easy song to fall in love with. It's perhaps the best song Maiden have done in many years; to a lot of people it's the best song they ever did. Its especially awesome live; on Rock in Rio and REal Live Dead one, you can hear the crown singing along with every bit of it, even the guitar. This album is worth getting for this song alone; I used to play it live in our band and it was really cool to do Bruce's 'fear of the dark - YOU (crowd sings 'fear of the dark'). (thats the live version by the way) <br /> <br />Of course the Crowd never sang back but that wasn't the point... <br /> <br />
B000001FOL|5.0|Chelsea Girl was Nico's solo debut.  The teutonic songtress<br /><br />sings the songs with an eerie dead pan voice.  The songs were written by Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed/ John Cale.  Accompanying Nico on the album is John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Lou Reed.  Reed and Cale wanted to make the album musically sparse, only the sound of viola and guitars.  But the producer Tom Wilson overproduced the album by adding extra strings, piano and woodwind instruments.  Only a couple of these tracks have the sound<br /><br />Reed and Cale were looking for (Chelsea Girl and It was a Pleasure Then).<br /><br />People talk about Janis Joplin being the queen of blues and rock.  Nico is the Empress of the Avant-Garde, from her debut with the Velvet Underground until her death due to complications from years of drug abuse, Nico lived her life like the way she wanted to.  No clean living for her, it was party all the time.  The queen of cool, Nico will be forgotten.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is an album that makes you wish you had been a teenager, or at least of appreciable age in the early 80's, so that you could have embraced this band in a more nurturing environment, where new albums were only about a year apart and Iron Maiden toured mercilessly. <br /> <br />Piece of Mind is another excellent record, Maiden's 4th and the follow up to the monstrously good Number of the Beast. It does not disappoint; recorded in Nassau, Bahamas, Maiden perhaps even surpassed Number of the Beast; I prefer Piece of Mind slightly over it at least. <br /> <br />It's hard to find fault with this album; all the songs are good, with most of them being great. The strongest points are undoubtedly Revelations, TO Tame a Land, and probably the Trooper (i've heard it so much that I often neglect how good it is as a song). It opens with a great drum fill by Nicko (this was his first album with the band after Clive Burr left) on 'Where Eagles Dare' and doesn't stop rocking until the end of 'To Tame a Land', a classic progressive song, which foreshadowed the Rime of the Ancient Mariner on the follow-up, Powerslave <br /> <br />In addition to classic maiden songs like the Trooper and Flight of Icarus, we also find overlooked masterpieces; Still Life is a very underrated song that is just awesome. Revelations is a very touching song (I think, Bruce's first song on his own...? correct me if I'm wrong), and Where Eagles Dare and Die With your boots on are great rocking tracks <br /> <br />IF there is a weak point it is often said to be 'quest for fire' or 'sun and steel'. Personally I see nothing wrong with 'Sun and Steel', it has a great chorus; sure it's about fencing but its still good. I wouldn't style it 'filler', at least quality wise. It's nonetheless a good track <br /> <br />Quest for fire is probably the weakest song; not necessarily because of the music; it's got some good guitar in there. BUT its hard not to laugh at the subject-matter of the song; i.e. cavemen battling dinosaurs. THe opening lyric is quite silly 'In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth', and most hardcore fans consider Quest for Fire to be their WORST song, purely because of the silliness. I must agree that the song isn't great, but it really isn't bad and 8 out of 9 is a pretty good ratio of great songs as far as I'm concerned <br /> <br />If you like Iron Maiden, buy this album. It's a great precursor to Powerslave, which IMHO is the BEST album they made.
B0000256KE|5.0|For Your Pleasure was Roxy Music's second album and last one with founding member Brian Eno. The musical friction between Ferry and Eno made one hell of an album.  This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time.  All the songs are great, there are no stinkers or disc padders.  From the first track until the last note, For Your Pleasure is a delight to listen to.  The suave and smoothness of Brian Ferry, the thrashing guitar riffs of Phil Manzara and the experimental sound from Brian Eno take an ordinary pop album to a whole new level.  One of my all time favorites.  Take a chance and grab a copy, you wont regret it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This movie did not stereotype Asian men, as one reviewer suggested. The fathers of several characters were portrayed as caring, loving, and supportive individuals. This story was about overcoming grief, poverty, and the emotional and physical struggles that many foreigners who come to this country often encounter. Grab out the tissue box, sit back, relax and enjoy this wonderful film about the importance of relationships, and the strength and power that one can gain from a tough life.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|American Recordings IV was the last studio album from the \\"Man in Black\\".  It's an appropiate way to end a great career.<br /><br />I don't know how he managed to record this disc because he was in very bad shape, but Cash has managed to summon up enough strength to record one of his best albums.  Hurt (a Nine Inch Nails cover) is a fitting epitath to one of the last legends of country music.  Abandonded and forgetton by the same industry he help create, Johnny Cash found a second home with the alternative crowd.  People who appreciate real country music.  Too bad they'll never be another like him, a true musical pioneer from his first recordings for Sun Records until his last album for American Records, a legend will sadly be missed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000060P79|1.0|Okay, I'll make this quick and to the point; this is awful. And for every poser Simple Plan fan who gives me a negative, I'll just write another 1-star review. You know why? <br /> <br />Cause I'm a idiot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY
B00004XONN|5.0|For years and years as a youth, I had hated Radiohead. I figured why waste my time with a band whos lead singer sounds like a whiney cat that cant pronounce when he sings. But I started to get tired of the repetition that is Nickelback and modern rock radio, and I wanted something completely different. So on a total whim, without hearing anything whatsoever, i went out and bought Kid A.<br />And now it's my favorite album ever. EVER. <br />The album explores sonic landscapes layered with unique and pulsating textures. It almost sounds like each song had to just exist, like putting it together would have been too complex, instrument by instrument. The 10/4 beat of &quot;everything in its right place&quot;, the seemingly random xylophone notes on &quot;Kid A&quot;, and tracks like &quot;idioteque&quot;, which completely blows you away near the end of the album (&quot;now they're doing techno? Or pop?&quot;)<br />Sheer perfection.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Welcome to Part 1 of my 10-part \\"Signs of the Apocalypse\\" saga. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />PART 1 <br /> <br />   The first sign that the world is ending is that Shrek gets hit sales in theaters and then goes on to have a sequel. It's sad. <br /> <br /> <br />   The second sign is that Shrek would be on a version of Operation. And it is. That's even sadder. <br /> <br />   The third sign that the world is ending is that the Shrek 2 disc special edition has an average of 4 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That is all. I applaud the not helpfuls. I will swim in them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY
B0000C9V3T|3.0|I have to say that when I was watching this movie, I felt every last piece of music and its timing in the film was perfect. Every note aligned with every frame. I went to buy this soundtrack right away after I first watched this film, expecting so much, yet became very dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, this has all the very important songs. The opening, of course. Bacalov's Grand Duel, the music during the anime scenes where O-Ren witnesses her parent's murders, Green Hornet, Meiko Kaji, Isaac Hayes, all here. My big let down though is that Santa Esmerelda's version of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood occupies half of the second side of the LP. In addition, one of the songs by the 5.6.7.8's is not here at all, and neither are some of the melodies from the fight scene with the Crazy 88's, mainly being Nobody But Me, as well as that nifty old timey, western music when the bride is fighting Johhny Mo. NOT TO MENTION that bad battle theme when the Bride severs Sofie's arm before the fight at the House of Blue Leaves begins. That classic was in one of the trailers, yet not on the soundtrack. Esmeralda is the biggest dissappointment though. All that wasted space, about 9 minutes worth when only one minute of it, instrumental only, is even in the film. Plus, the RZA's Ode to Oren Ishii is not in the film, and is not that good of a song either. The album arranger must have been treating this soundtrack like a toy car for Godzilla to stomp upon. Still, I am glad I have this, because like I said, all the main themes are in this.
B0002BO0AS|2.0|It's nice to know that some bands in the metalcore genre are in touch with their \\"roots\\", and that they'd like to pick up where Swedish death metal left off, but not to this point of monotony and whoredom. I will admit, they are talented at playing guitar, but that's easily surmounted with the fact that most of their material is ripped off. If an American band isn't ripping off At the Gates, they're stealing from In Flames. And the HORRIBLE, disgustingly sad part is that In Flames does not have nearly as much popularity in the United States as Unearth. They don't get any credit. To exemplify the unoriginality and trendiness that surrounds the scene we're looking at right now, I walked into my brother's high school for his graduation, and there, right in the foyer, was an acrylic painting of Unearth's \\"Oncoming Storm\\" album cover. I kid you not. I recognized it as so immediately. It's a great great album cover, everything aside, but these are the kinds of kids who are feeding on this whoredom. I say GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE. As I Lay Dying and Unearth are flukes. As I Lay Dying used to be a Zao ripoff before switching to copy someone else. If you want creative Gothenburg metal, go pick up Arsis' \\"A Celebration of Guilt\\". If you want an unbiased, honest Swedish death metal sound, pick up At the Gates' \\"Terminal Spirit Disease\\", In Flames' \\"The Jester Race\\", or Dark Tranquillity's \\"Damage Done\\". There are a lot of original American bands out there, but Unearth is not one of them.
B00005A46T|5.0|Ok, first of all Slipknot is my favorite band.  I am a 27 year old female.  I'm a chemist.  I just wanted to write this review because I read some comments about Slipknot fans being stupid and that really irritated me.  If you don't like Slipknot, that's fine.  Why do you even need to look at their album on Amazon then?  Ok, about the album...Personally, I think this is Slipknot's best album.  I like their self-titled one just as much but I was really impressed when Iowa came out.  I was afraid that they were going to commercialize their music after the success of their first album and I figured it wouldn't be very heavy.  Boy was I wrong.  This album is harder than the first.  Their new album, Vol 3, is technically better than the first two but I just don't feel it in the same way.  If you read the lyrics, it's pretty obvious that Corey Taylor is an intelligent guy.  I'm going to bet that the people talking crap in their reviews wouldn't be able to define some of the words he uses.  But I guess that all of us Slipknot fans really shouldn't care what anyone else thinks.  Isn't that part of the point of what they are saying??
B0000931OG|4.0|At the time of this release, it was evident to me that Albarn had lost some of his confidence with blur after the departure of partner Graham Coxon. He wasnt nervous with gorillaz since it was just a side project, but with blur as his main act(atleast at this time it was) he knew it was going to be a different album.  At the time i didnt like the change, the lack of the loud guitars, a crappy single Crazy Beat, but now looking back on it, i think it should remembered just as higly as all other blur albums. Apart from two weak songs (crazy beat and jet both seem to be not even worthy as b sides to me), this is a great album. But the fabulous opening \\"Ambulance\\" and \\"out of time\\" was enough to let me forgive them for crazy beat.  The album takes a soft turn with \\"Good song\\", which is very very good. \\"on my way to the club\\" is a lazy, semi dance low down with some interesting guitar from Rowntree, at the time i didn't like it, but now i think of it as a classic. \\"brothers and sisters\\" takes the same style as the previous.  \\"caravan\\" is a personal favorite of mine from the album, while \\"we've got a file on you\\" is a song i love but wish it could of been made a little longer.the next two tracks are not stand outs but they are good, and show some contiuation from previous blur albums. \\"jets\\" is a pretty awful turn but recovers with \\"Gene by Gene\\" another fantasic tune that should of been a single. The sad farewell to Coxon is \\"Battery in your leg\\" which has great guitars and a sad meloncholy vocal from Damon. Another classic. This album should be more appreciated. now a couple years after its release it is a definite classic and many of the previous fans that did not pick this up(sales were low with this album, though downloading could of been a slight cause)should try giving it a listen.
B000022TSY|5.0|Driven with an excellent sound track this is a film about two guys how throw their legs across their choppers and head out on the highway for adventure.  What could be any more \\"biker\\" than that?  As they wander with little direction they come across and leave, without recognizing it, the one thing they are searching for.  Near the end of the film one braggs about reaching the American dream while the other finally realizes they were fools and missed their dreams.  The film ends with audience pathos at the sadness of two high ideal losers who could have had it all.  Perhaps this is a commentary on the counter culture of the period.  We had high ideals and recognized the failures of the previous generation, but had trouble pulling it all together ourselves.<br /><br />Now, everytime I throw my leg across my Harley and head out for a road trip I stick my Steppenwolf CD in and relive the adventure, in 21st century fashion of course.<br /><br />TRIVIA:<br /><br />My favorite song from the dvd, \\"Born To Be Wild\\" describes motorcycle engines as \\"Heavy Metal Thunder\\".  This reference gave birth to a new name for hard, driving, rock music.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />The movie is disturbing, hard to follow, and born of the counter culture, circa 1970.
1400031362|5.0|The ladies of The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Mma Precious Ramotswe and Mma Grace Makutsi, continue to help people solve the problems in their lives. In this installment, Mma Ramotswe finds out what's behind the poisoning of family members of The Government Man who comes to her office convinced his sister-in-law is the culprit. Before the mystery is solved, however, Mma Ramotswe becomes ill herself while visiting the family in question. While Mma Ramotswe is away, Mma Makutsi is hired by the head of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest to see which of the four finalists is deserving of the title. Since both women are perceptive, as well as clever, each uncovers the truth in due time. Meanwhile, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni continues to be vexed by his two apprentices who seem far more interested in sloughing off and going on about girls than they are about fixing cars. He has also begun to exhibit strange behavior. Is he having second thoughts about marrying Mma Ramotswe?<br /><br />The ease with which Alexander McCall Smith tells his stories continues to attract my devoted attention. His descriptions of Mma Precious Ramotswe's Africa and his portrayal of her personality, and that of his other characters, are delightful, often amusing, and full of wise, philosophical musings. One observation made by Mma Ramotswe about a maid in the house of the poisoning goes thus: \\"Here was another with a motive, she reflected, but the thought was absurd. This was an honest woman. Her face was open and she smiled as she spoke. Secrets left shadows on the face, and there were none there.\\" I re-read the words \\"secrets left shadows on the face\\" several times, pondering the depth of wisdom in their simplicity.<br /><br />This is the third in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, and each one is as good as the last. It's also clear that Mr. Smith has a love of Africa (Botswana in particular) that clearly shines through in his descriptions of the land and the customs of its people. I don't want the series to end!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe HillI don't want the series to end! <br />     <br />Carolyn Rowe Hill <br />
B00005JNJT|4.0|It's a shame this movie had to arrive in 2005, because it makes previous Batman movies completely obsolete.      Taking cues from the original - strong storytelling, character development, good visuals - Batman Begins feels like a completely new Batman, because in many ways it is; it's a return to strong storytelling.     Whereas previous Batman movies (Returns, Forever, Batman and Robin) felt hollow in spots, this one under new direction from Christopher Nolan (Memento), feels more complete. Given that it is long (140 minutes), dark, and the first hour of the film is all exposition, that's a huge achievement.  The striking difference with \\"Begins\\" is the details: believable city, sharp humor, developed characters - all items that previous Batman films - with the exception of the original - lacked to some degree.        Given the constraints of a prequel, and being confined to telling the origin of everything now familiar to the audience, the results are very solid.  It is immensely satisfying to watch the now famous Batman staples (Batcave, Batsuit, Batmobile, Batblades) come to fruition. We have now been given reasons why the Bat was chosen as his symbol, what Bruce Wayne did before becoming Batman, and even been introduced to the supplier of his gadgets (Lucius Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, solid as always).  These details add new weight to what was originally a strong storytelling foundation.      Gotham City is improved as well. Whereas previous Gothams (such as the one found in Batman Forever) felt too futuristic and neon (color), this Gotham actually resembles a city people could live in, one that bears close resemblance to Chicago. Another bonus is the humor. In one great scene, a slightly intoxicated Bruce Wayne dismisses all his freeloading, brown-nosing guests, telling them the \\"the party's over; it's not a joke. Get-out.\\" and watches with delight as they leave.  Additionally, there is subtle humor employed during a chase scene (\\"At least tell me what itlooks like...Nevermind)\\" and even Alfred knocks Bruce's reasoning for doing all his pushups (\\"What's the point of of all those pushups if you can't lift a bloody log?)\\" Each adds lightness to an otherwise dark, intense, fast-paced film.      That, to its entirety, emphasizes the strengths of the film: it feels genuine.  The actors are well-cast, and the acting is very good.  Christian Bale plays a very likeable, layered Batman, Michael Caine accels as Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (Batman's gadget man). Liam Neeson (Jean Luc Ducard) and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon) give strong performances, as expected.     There are a few creative flaws, however.      As one watches the film, the sheer abundance of villains is staggering.  Unlike other super hero movies, Bruce Wayne/Batman doesn't have one concentrated enemy.  He seems to fight everyone (in shifts). Bruce/Batman battles martial arts vigilantes the League of Shadows, an organized crime boss, a psychologically twisted Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, and his business boss, Mr. Earle.  By the end, all enemies are part of the League of Shadows led by Ducard.  Batman's only allies are his caretaker Alfred (Michael Caine), District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman). Only Gordon assists him in battle. Amidst all the internal and external conflicts, it's a wonder Bruce can soar at all.  Perhaps this adds to the heroic charisma of our Caped Crusader? Additonally, the final climactic disaster, the contamination of Gotham City's water supply, is a scary coda in this age of terrorism - one that may hit too close for some viewers.      Small criticism aside, \\"Begins\\" is a soaring success. The story flows well from start to finish, with no loose ends. Notably, the final frame featuring the Bat signal and foreshadowing of the Joker's wrath on Gotham brings the movie to an effective end, and the Batman saga to its appropriate original beginning.  Given Nolan's strong direction, itviews like a prequel and a new saga all in one.  If the next story involving the Joker were told again by Nolan, the audience would surely come back to see it.        Summer movies are typically ones filled with big action/cheap laughs but short on smarts.  Batman Begins is a movie that is a summer movie anomaly - it is entertaining AND sharply written.  Though it is a prequel, Batman Begins gives new wings to a fluttering franchise.
1573223026|5.0|A Long Way Day is a first-person narrative with four narrators.  This could have been confusing or repetitive -- but it's neither.  Once the reader is well-into the book, he wouldn't even need the label above each chapter (chapter is not the proper word, but oh well) to know who is narrating.  Each character has her or own unique voice, and it's not through catch phrases or some similarly-lazy technique.  Each is developed well throughout the book.  It is emotional and a little thought-provoking without being overly sappy or morose.  I was looking forward to this book, and was not disappointed.  As with all Hornby's fiction, I laughed out loud several times, and am only sad that I now have a long wait till his next.
B00005OAIE|5.0|For those of you who are interested in John Mayer, or who like the little that you've heard of him, please pay no attention to those who have dubbed John Mayer as \\"untalented\\"!!! If anything, John Mayer is one of the MOST talented artists out there in today's music world! When I see a legendary guitarist like Buddy Guy play with John Mayer and while playing, forget his solo, and John Mayer picks up where Buddy left off, that's pretty amazing! His lyrics are far from boring! I am one who pays particular attention to lyrics, and I love his! They are funny and creative and just different from so many others. I myself am a guitar player, and I only DREAM of being half as good as John Mayer! So to all those who wanna rip on John Mayer (especially those who are fans of The Cars), I suggest you really find out just how talented he, or any other artist, is, before you judge him, just because you don't care for his style of music. Thank you.
B0007PALZ2|3.0|12 MONKEYS is certainly one of the most innovative scifi films of the nineties, with a complex performance from Bruce Willis and a showy Oscar nominated turn from Brad Pitt.  Terry Gilliam directs with a fierce impending sense of doom, and the supporting cast features a particularly effective Madeleine Stowe.  Time travel movies are often hard to construct, and Gilliam tries novel approaches to the theme.  I found myself getting confused at various times, not sure of what Willis' role was in stopping the virus, and just who the people were that were manipulating him.  Willis gives a fierce performance and Stowe is very good as the psychiatrist who finds herself Willis' soulmate.  The movie's cryptic ending left me wondering what had happened and what would happen in the future.  Technically a good film, but somehow it left me wanting more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|As if Coldplay couldn't get any better!! Wow!!  Can I just say that I am totally thrilled about Coldplay's new album, \\"X&Y\\"?  While I'll admit that I was expecting this to be more like \\"Parachutes\\" or \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", they still sound like \\"Coldplay\\", however, this one has little more edge to it.  This one may even sound a little more \\"commerical\\" or \\"pop-ish\\", but every song is original, which just proves how talented this quartet from Britain really is.  As a big fan of Coldplay, I find this album to be an excellent work of art from a band who delivers a refreshing sound to the alternative genre.  Do I think they sound like U2 or Radiohead?  No, I don't--Coldplay has their own sound and they are still developing their style and talent. And if you happen to see them in concert, I think you'd be amazed at how some of these songs sound when performed live.
037542217X|5.0|This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series and Mma Makutsi comes into her own in this installment. We have learned in previous books that this lady is very smart, very capable, and willing to work hard. While Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni is recovering from depression, Mma Makutsi takes over the running of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Suddenly, the two apprentices shape up big time, and Mma can even fix cars!<br /><br />What a remarkable lady is Mma Makutsi. Remarkable and lonely. Then she meets Mr. Bernard Selelipeng and...but, I'm getting ahead of myself. While Mma Makutsi is busy with two businesses, Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (manager of one, assistant detective with the other) she realizes she needs to open her own business if she truly wants a secure future. She hits upon the idea of a typing school for men. Classes could be held in the evening, which wouldn't interfere with her other two jobs. Mr. Bernard Selelipeng is one of her students, and therein lies that story. Two other men play a prominent role in this book: one who wants to atone for past sins; the other, a pompous windbag who thinks he is a better detective than any woman could possibly be. We also learn more about how the two orphans, Motholeli and Puso, taken in by Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni in Tears of the Giraffe, are adjusting to their new life.<br /><br />My only fear as I read these wonderful books is whether or not I'm reading/pronouncing the proper names of people and places correctly. But then, in our ever-increasing global society, we're all going to have to learn how to properly pronounce one another's names, somehow.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill
B00097DX3U|4.0|The title says it all: Audioslave sounds like a tight rock band, not a disjointed supergroup.   <br /> <br /> On their debut album, moments of flourish were clearly there, but the band sounded as if they lacked chemisty - they had afterall only been together a few months.  Now years later, Audioslave emerges with \\"Out of Exile\\", a record more inspired by the bluesy hard rock of Led Zeppelin and Soundgarden than the hard-hitting funk rock of Rage Against the Machine.   <br /> <br /> Whereas their last album sometimes felt too entrenched in slow, sludgy Black Sabbath riffs, the songs this time around flow so much better, as the emphasis seems to be on the songs (and melodies), not merely rocking out. Audioslave, interesting enough, is most successful in its understated moments, such as on first single, \\"Be Yourself\\" (featuring a great solo from Tom Morello), \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\" and \\"Dandelion\\", which borrows its riffs a bit from Zep's classic, \\"Over the Hills and Far Away.\\"   <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, this doesn't mean that Audioslave has gone soft, because they haven't. What they've done is melded bits from both of their respective bands, and made subtle changes, making both sounds new and exciting.  Opening tracks, \\"Your Time Has Come\\" and \\"Out of Exile\\" rock hard and melodically, making for an excellent 1-2 punch to start out the album.  The Rage funkiness is revisited on \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" (featuring a turn-table scratch for a solo) and \\"Man or Animal\\" which melds both RATM and Soundgarden - RATM in song structure and rousing drum fills, Soundgarden in its \\"Outshined\\"-esque chorus.   <br /> <br />The only real missteps are the slow, bluesy, and somewhat aimless \\"Heaven's Dead\\" and \\"The Curse\\" which feels like a studio outtake, not a complete song. Moreover, it is Morello's guitar wizardry that sometimes borders on excess. At times, a simple guitar solo (like that found on \\"Dandelion\\" or \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\") seems to fit the song better than his \\"let's see what unusual sounds we can rip this time\\" approach. Still, given the previous record, ten solid songs out of twelve makes for quite an album, especially in 2005, with the musical fodder as thick as ever.   <br /> <br />The album title, \\"Out of Exile\\" is appropriate. No longer a mixture of two huge bands, Audioslave sounds quite comfortable in its new incarnation - the band is on the same page, playing some of the strongest blues-based Zeppelin-inspired hard rock heard in years. It's not Rage, and it's not Soundgarden. It's Audioslave, and it's among the most promising mainstream rock and roll being played by anyone right now.
B00004S35Z|5.0|How much does one really have to say about Stevie Wonder? If you don't already know that he's a genius you've been living under a rock for the last 40 years. \\"Fulfillingness' First Finale\\" falls right in the middle of Wonder's most fruitful period or pretty much the entire 1970's! When he says \\"Sing it loud for your people\\" in \\"You Haven't Done Nuthin\\" you'll surely join in the pure confection. If you don't you must not have a soul because this music is so powerful, moving, romantic and soulful that it would make anyone stand up and testify to the power of Wonder. The songs flow seamlessly from one into the next switching grooves without missing a beat. There's also spectacular guest appearances by The Jackson 5 and backing vocals by the late great Minnie Ripperton. If you don't own this album you should buy it now because you won't buy anything better! It's not the sprawling masterwork that \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\" is (though what is?) but it's just as good an album . It's amazing to think that this music was recorded 31 years ago. It sounds as fresh today as any R&B music you'll hear and like most of Wonder's music it holds up well. Buy it now!
B0007XT7V8|3.0|Not a bad release. No Surprise is definitely the best track on this release by far. Some other good songs include...Santa Monica, Say Goodbye, Hello Lonely, and Better Off.  <br /> <br />The quality of the songs drastically drop off after No Surprise though, as others have stated.  <br /> <br />One thing I will say is that the first CD is a hell of a lot better than this effort, and for the ones turned off by this one, should purchase or Download some songs from the debut CD.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Have you seen \\"The Blair Witch Project?\\" If you have then you are aware that it was not up to movie standards, and the same holds true for this movie.  It has elementary humor at best and has no plot throughout he movie.  The only thing the movie supports is a school election for his friend Pedro.  The characters in the movie are weak and less than humorous for the buzz that the movie recieved.  I am a big movie go-er and have seen several titles, but when they said that this was must see humor then what the heck has happened to our movies today?
B000005IS1|5.0|This album is the finest live album I have ever heard. It also happens to be one of the greatest punk albums recorded. That being said, here's why. It has good sound quality, for the band is clear, yet the crowd's presence is known. The music itself is excellent, with the distortion on the Mosrite and Fender guitars ideal. While vocals are not ideally strong, they compliment the rest of the band well. All in all, this album is a must have for any serious rock fan, and would do well in the collection of anyone.
B00003CXA3|5.0|This review is for the single DVD widescreen version released by 20th Century Fox in 2004.      Based on a true story, Gene Hackman stars as New York narcotics detective \\"Popeye\\" Doyle who stumbles into a major heroin smuggling operation.  Hackman does a great job portraying a less than perfect policeman in a less than glamorous part of New York.      The movie has an authentic look to it and the story holds your interest from start to finish.  The car chase is a classic and the ending takes a disturbing turn.  The film won five Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1971.  The DVD transfer is flawless and razor sharp.  The commentaries by Hackman and Scheider and a separate one by director William Friedkin are nice DVD bonuses.  An absolutely essential DVD for any crime drama fan's collection!      Movie: A    DVD Quality: A+
B00005JNJT|5.0|Tim Burton's Batman movies sucked (Ok, Jack Nicholson looked cool as the Joker). The plots were geared for folks with ADD and the art direction was more \\"Burton\\" than it was Batman.  Then Joel Schumacher had a vision to mix Batman with musical theatre stage production (bad acting, colored lights, claustrophobic sets and homoeroticism) literally killing Batman.  Given this history, I was barely interested in seeing Batman Begins, but I can honestly say that this is the first movie based off of a super hero that I liked at all (sorry I just don't like Spiderman).  Bale is perfect for the duality of this role, and get this, he actually looks like he could kick the crap out of you.  Noland & Goyer bring Miller's vision of Gotham to life wonderfully  (no greasy perms or latex nipples).  The Batmobile finally looks real instead of like Michael Jackson's Liberachi-esqe dream toy.  Add it all up and suddenly Batman is cool again.  Katie Holms doesn't really work in this film.  She is too young and too trendy to make me believe she is the district attorney. Also, just hire a Chinese choreographer for the action sequences instead of choppy, close up action scenes.  The sequel needs to be more of the same (Bale, Nolan & Goyer).  I also think Crispin Glover would make an awesome joker.
B0000027F8|5.0|If you're a big George Michael fan like I am you should already own this album. I'm writing this review for the casual fan who doesn't own this album already. If you're that person purchase \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" immediately. It's that good and I promise you won't be disappointed. Unfortunately I made the mistake of waiting way too long to purchase it. I only regret now that I didn't buy it sooner. Yes, the album is a bit less funky and up-tempo than it's predecessor \\"Faith\\" but it's no lesser a piece of work I assure you. It's a more mature album than \\"Faith\\" and I would say holds up fifteen years later as well or better. \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\" is an excellent cover of the Stevie Wonder song which incredibly is sung live according to the liner notes. \\"Soul Free\\" is as funky as any George Michael song so you can't say the album doesn't has it's more upbeat moments, of course along with \\"Freedom\\" as well. Seriously there's not a weak moment on the album. I only wish that George wouldn't have pulled his disapearing act at the time because it deprived a lot more people from purchasing this album and making it as succesfull as it should have been. Just remember you're not going to hear \\"Faith II\\" and you'll surely love this album as much as I do.
B0002KVUMK|5.0|Warning some spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Like most of the other movies I gave 5 stars I waited ever since the first commercail of it aired and when I watched it I was amazed.I just loved this movie and it was one of my top 5 favorites for a while but I didn't review it the first time,you know why?because if your like me and you watched it the first week it came out and you loved it WATCH IT AGAIN IT just gets better and better,when I watched it the first time I was amazed ,it exceeded all my expectations and when I watched it the second time,I WAS BLOWN AWAY,since it was a few months or so since I had seen it the first time I had forgotten some of the best parts,like when he turns into a werewolf and kills Dracula,or when the screen's black and white and all those other good parts.So if you haven't seen it or you haven't seen it in awhile GO WATCH IT  NOW!well that's all I have to say about this movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|After seeing some of these reviews I had to plug this CD.  It is by far one of the best rock CD's of the past year!  American Idiot blows away anything Green Day has done in the past.  In the great tradition of bands like The Who, Green Day puts together a great concept album, but forget all that.  This album JUST PLAIN ROCKS!  Song #2, Jesus of Suburbia, has the most awesome song opening chords, and it has to be one of the best 8-minute-+ tunes out there.  Holiday is another great thumping tune-- in fact, this whole album is awesome to work out to.  Green Day's music has reached a level of sophistication where they have transcended their \\"pop-punk\\" label-- this is a majestic work-- I don't know how they could set the bar any higher for all those crappy clones out there.  And I was even more impressed when I saw them play these songs live on TV and also sounded great!  I've listened to Green Day since Dookie and they have never sounded better.  Highly recommended!!!!
B0009IW88A|5.0|The score for Batman Begins is not the usual super-hero score.   There is not a brassy bold fanfare like the original Batman movie or a main theme filled with wonder like Superman or Spider-Man.  It is in many ways an atypical score.  First, there are two composers and they are two of the best in Hollywood, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  One would think that putting these two together would reveal a score that is a mishmash, but the composers do a fine job complimenting one another.  The score that they produce is dark, action packed and quietly poignant.  I totally enjoyed it.  I would certainly have to rate it among my favorite super-hero scores and among the best of the recent scores in the last couple of years.  Since I got it about less than a week ago, I have listened to it 10 times, and each time I have enjoyed more of it.  Batman has been reborn both visually and musically.  I hope the next movie keeps the two together.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have to admit that I was a little bit worried when Coldplay's album was delayed a whole year, especially because it was for a lack of passion. Thankfully the end result is fine and even worth the long three-year wait. <br /> <br />This album is full of strong tracks and contains five of my all-time favorite songs: Speed of Sound (single one), Fix You (single two), Square One, Talk, and White Shadows. ABSOLUTELY worth your money. <br /> <br />I would recommend buying the single version of Speed of Sound if you get the chance for the last-minute-cut songs Things I Don't Understand and Proof.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The Machinist is a good film. Not great, but good. But the things that make this film memorable, isn't the plot or the general synopsis of the film. Remarkably , it's the dedicated acting and the excellent directing. Jennifer Jason Leigh ,Aitana Sanchez Gijon, Michael Ironside ,and John Sherian provide  the perfect supporting cast. However the dedication of Christian Bale , to his character (Trevor Reznik) , transports this simple film , to cult classic status. As with the other reviews , I'll reintereate that Bale's performance was outstanding , by simply underplaying his character. His brilliant performance is also highlighted by his appearance. I've seen alot of movies. However , I've never seen any actor go through such a physical transformation. It took atleast 30 min. to get over the fact that Bale lost so much weight for this film. After that initial distraction , the film took on unexpected hieghts and emotional depths , that I'm sure I'll remember for years. This is a definate film , for Bale fans , to watch. And compounded by the casting of Christian Bale , as the new Batman........this makes The Machinist, even more credible and amazing.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Anyone who considers DT at their best on Images and Words, Awake and Train of Thought will not like this album. Sorry, but the inclusion of \\"electronica\\" is a deal breaker with me. And where the hell are the odd time signatures? Portnoy was definitely taking a breather on this one; he could've played it in his sleep. In fact, maybe that's what he did. (It would explain a lot.) Granted, DT albums take a minimum listen of a couple dozen times to \\"get them,\\" but this is virtual elevator music in relation to past albums. I'll listen to it but I won't like it (much).
B000002KIE|5.0|I bought this when this came out in 1977 at an import shop and it was the most liberating album I'd heard in my then 16 years of existence.  Quite simply the snottiest, most revolutionary and most importanly ROCKING album at a time when rock wasn't played on the radio at all.  Those were the days of boring twaddle like Boston, Foreigner and the musical excrement known as disco.  The Pistols brought danger back into the rock and roll equation, and inspired countless thousands of kids to pick up some instruments and play their own music.  Along with the Ramones and the Clash, the Sex Pistols are one of the most influential and historically important bands of the seventies.  Rock was reborn: punk, new wave, metal, post punk, pop music all either sprang from or were renewed by the big bang that was the Sex Pistols and punk rock.  As for the tremendously ignorant reviewer who said something to the effect that the British didn't care about slagging the queen because she's a figurehead.  Oh my, God Save The Queen was HUGELY revolutionary and offensive to the British.  The Pistols were banned from the BBC and from playing live in England precisely because of the love the British have for the monarchy and tradition.  Slagging the Queen is tantamount to an American covering the flag in sh*t and lighting it on fire and then dousing the flames with urine.  Yes the Pistols were manufactured by ambitious and then unknown fashion designer Malcolm McLaren, well he agreed to manage them and most importantly found Johnny Rotton. No they weren't the first punk band nor were they the first punk band I'd ever heard.  I heard the Ramones first album and the Dammed's first album before the Sex Pistols.  But those bands, while very good, didn't have the visceral punch, and f*ck you and everything you stand for attitude.  Never Mind The Bollocks was much rawer, much ruder.  It was a nihilistic sound born out of the desperate state of English political and economic reality.  It was a time of no future, to quote God Save the Queen:  \\"your future gleam is a shopping scheme.\\"  The music was born of the hopelessness of the first British generation to have it (much) worse off than their parents.  The empire had died.  Society and politics were not to be trusted.  So why should the Sex Pistols, as young Brits, attempt to belong to a society that provides no hope?  As a political stance the Sex Pistols were nihilists rather than anarchists.  Anarchy is a ridiculous political ideology if there ever was one, Crass' magnificence notwithstanding.  Hmmm, yeah people will cooperate with one another to everyone's mutual advantage, ha!  Grow up.  The Pistols were not about making a statement so much as in creating chaos and holding British society up to itself in a mirror.  From the beginning manager Malcolm McLaren declared the Pistols were an art project or perhaps a marketing project for his boutique rather than a band and either because of or perhaps in spite of McLaren's vision, ambition and hype, the Sex Pistols music is much more powerful than any of their contemporaries.  Malcolm didn't write any of the songs.  He brought the band together, but their music was their own.<br /><br />BTW, for a fantastic history of this band, it's impact and times check out the documentary The Filth And Fury featuring interviews with everyone connected with band including Glen Matlock and Sid Vicious and a lot of live footage.no future, to quote God Save the Queen:  \\"your future gleam is a shopping scheme.\\"  The music was born of the hopelessness of the first British generation to have it (much) worse off than their parents.

0975991477|5.0|I have always wondered whether most of the things we know in life are FACTS or BELIEF.  My current conclusion is that most of what we understand about reality is really based on our perceptions. I have met Bruce Lipton personally and also during his lecture in Singapore, and for the first time I felt that his message was a true synthesis of science and spirituality.  When you read his book, his findings are actually clarifying all the \\"traditional\\" healing methods as well as the \\"new\\" theraupeutic approaches that are now based on a more quantum or energetic orientations.   <br /> <br />I have also read some of the other reviews, and I think even if we don't know what the actual FINAL FACT is about cells and the keys of life, I still feel that his PERCEPTION about life are much more empowering for most people who used to fall victim to their own limiting belief.  My heart tells me that he is speaking the truth, but I will not force anyone to take it as facts, because I believe everyone has the right to find their own truth. <br /> <br />Thank you Bruce Lipton, you are truly one of my heroes.. <br /> <br />Reza Gunawan <br />info@truenaturehealing.net
B000002O96|4.0|Despite what some of the reviewers state, this album is a real treat for fans of Muddy, Wolf and Bo. It's just alot of fun to listen to . I am a huge fan of Muddy and Wolf and to hear them interact and have fun with Bo Diddley is worth the price of admission. Any Blues fan should buy this album.
0803723865|5.0|My cousin, a preschool teacher, bought this book for my 19 month old son. I thought it was probaby too old for him, and too scary for my 3 year old. How wrong I was! My son loves this book so much that he makes us read it to him at least half a dozen times daily! He walks around the house saying \\"Oh no! Guwwawoh!\\" My 3 year old loves it just as much, and the 2 of them jump out on one another screaming \\"I'm a Gruffalo\\" (Guwwawoh in the younger one's case).  <br />We've had this book only 3 weeks and it's the biggest hit ever!
0312323859|5.0|I only purchased this book because I had read the first book (\\"Something Borrowed\\") and felt that because of my time already spent with these characters, I was obliged to read the second book (\\"Something Blue\\"), regardless of how much I loathed the main character in this new book.  I simply couldn't imagine how Ms. Giffin could make Darcy tolerable enough to be a heroine you want to root for in this new book, but alas, she did.  I can't believe it, but she did!  For good measure I reread the first book before I read this new book so my loathing of Darcy was at its peak.  Yet, this new book chronicles Darcy's journey into a character that has redeeming qualities and that you want to pull through.  It's a story of a woman coming of age a little late and finding happiness with herself, for herself, and for her friends.  In that process, she manages to finally learn what true friendship is.   <br /> <br />This book is definitely a quick read.  Its flow is continuous and its characters are vivid.  I likely would have finished it in one sitting, rather than the two it took me, if not for basic human needs like food and sleep.  I highly recommend that you give this \\"Something\\" series a try.  Ms. Giffin has managed to take situations and characters that seem to have no possible chance for a happy ending and makes them work.  Like me, you'll be happily surprised at what an enjoyable read these two books are.  However, I would not recommend reading \\"Something Blue\\" until after you have read \\"Something Borrowed.\\"   <br /> <br />Enjoy and happy reading!  I loved it, even when I was predisposed to think I wouldn't!  Perhaps, like Darcy, I have learned not to judge a book by its cover.  :)
B000002JK4|4.0|I picked up a copy of Robert Plant's album The Principle of Moments recently, at a used record store in Amherst MA, when my fiancee and I were visiting her old stomping grounds. Released in the early 1980s, this album represents a clear departure from Plant's Led Zeppelin days, sounding quiet and mellow and thoughtful.<br /><br />When this album first came out, I had only recently begun listening to popular music seriously, and the track \\"Big Log\\" made a big impression upon me, which has stuck with me through the years. Its mysterious lyrics and title are part of the draw.<br /><br />\\"In the Mood\\", however, is much less played. I think I missed it when it first came out as a single, all those years ago, and I usually hear nothing more than snippets on the radio. It's definitely underplayed; I have realy enjoyed hearing it on my car stereo this past week, as I drive to and from work. The lyrics are simple; it's the musical arrangement that draws me in.<br /><br />The other tracks on the disc are OK, in comparison; they act as the acoustic meat between these two gems, at either end of the disc. A worthwhile purchase, used.
B0001CNRS4|3.0|But that's about it. The story is typical and we've seen this a million times. The movie tries to make you feel good in the end, but it was presented in such a clich&eacute; matter, I saw right through it. I tried to shut off my critical eye and have fun but failed.
B0000683DH|5.0|Why is this the best Star Trek movie? There are many reasons and I'll cover them, but the number one reason is Lt. Saavik. Kirstie Alley is the greatest Star Trek character of all time. It is unfortunate that she did not continue with the series, but then again maybe she could not have had the time to be Rebecca Howe on Cheers, and that would have been a real tragedy.<br /><br />So aside from the sexy Vulcan played by Kirstie, this movie also boasts the acting talants of William Shatner at his best. You can tell in this movie he's going all out and wants to prove himself once and for all. His Oscar worthy performance is topped off when he screams \\"Kahn!!!!\\" into the comm-link. Pure acting genious.<br /><br />Not to be outdone by Shatner, Ricardo Montalban matches him line for line as Kahn. From hell's heart he stabs at Kirk, because revenge is best served cold. Playing Kahn is one of the highlights of Ricardo's career.<br /><br />Also there's some nonsense about a Genisis project. It's not that important. The important parts of this film are the characters. The old Spock and Bones ribbing is here, Scotty is still kicking butt in the engine room, and Uhura is still the sexiest communications officer.<br /><br />If I had any complaint about this movie, it's that the original short-skirt uniforms were gone. Uhura and Saavik's thighs would have made this movie that much better.<br /><br />Live well and prosper....
B000002WU9|5.0|I bought this album on tape years ago. For those that remember it was refered to as \\"The Purple Tape\\". This is a street album made up of precise lyrics and unique production. This was the RZA at his best. This was Raekwon at his best. And this was the birth of Ghostface as a force in hip hop. This album will never be duplicated.  Nas laced the album with an incredible verse. Capadonna submitted the best work of his career on this album. Everyone who participated on these records made history. Few albums have touched on the street life while demonstrating the pain and misery that comes along with the fast life. Rae and Ghost set up camp on the middle ground. Rza's tracks displayed feeling of rage and tranquility. The bottom line is simple. This is one of the greatest HIP HOP albums of all time. Perfection. I recommend it to anyone who expects their music on a higher plain. It is never too late. This album sounds as good today as it did in my youth. There will be no need to push the skip button on your cd player. Every track is a chapter in the story of why it was only built for cuban linx.
B0007LCNKM|4.0|How best to describe Brooklyn quintet The National's music? Alt Country? Americana? Alternative Rock? or just good old straight-up guitar driven rock 'n' roll. Is that shades of Wilco, Tindersticks, The Doors, Willard Grant Conspiracy and Luna I hear?<br /><br />To be honest I'm not entirely sure how to classify the sound coming forth from my speakers other than to say that their new album Alligator is categorically, uniformly superb.<br /><br />This is music better experienced than defined, so I won't wax lyrical about it's many virtues other than to say if you consider yourself an adventurous music listener, Alligator will repay your curiosity in spades.
B00008DDSC|5.0|A serious movie that is very well acted. It will compel you.  Mature audiences only--not necessarily just by age.  This is a movie you cannot quickly forget. Daring--like nothing I had seen before. A secretary into hurting herself physically develops a connection and a powerful DESIRE for her boss that has to be seen to be believed.  The movie ends with the most beautiful and poetic imagery that has been burnt into my mind.  ...and that song by Lizzie West, I had to look her up and buy the CD.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|this would be a great drive-in movie.  The plot is so simplistic that you could watch the first few minutes and know pretty much everything that will happen.      The story (such as it is) centers on paleoclimatologist (Dennis Quaid).  He has found evidence that there will be a massive climatic change soon, sometime between the next 100 to 1000 years.  He tries to explain to the incredibly dense government officals just how global warming could trigger an ice age and why action needed to be taken now.  Of course he is ignored and returns to his neglected family, his dedicated physician wife and his brilliant teenage son.  Naturally the catastrophe developes much sooner than he had predicted, like just after he had sent his son on a trip to New York which is naturally right in harm's way.  The remainder of the film is how humanity in general and this family in particular cope with the disaster.    This is as inane as most disaster films but the special effects are excellent.    The extra features are some deleted scenes, commentaries and a choice of Spanish or French dubbing (which could make this an interesting way to practice a foreign language), but nothing out of the ordinary.    Since drive-ins are in short supply these days I suggest just kicking back with the refreshments of your choice and enjoy this guilty pleasure.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this is revolution in your earphones. listen like it's cinema. don't attempt an analysis... it's only rock and roll.
B000003TA4|5.0|I still remember back in the day when this CD first came out.  Sure, there's already been punk music, and it wasn't exactly the newest thing in the world, but it took music in a new direction because of it's wide appeal.  Sure, there's people that won't like this CD, but it comes down to taste.  I find it really funny that the person who wrote under the \\"kids review\\" like 3 times for this CD bashes it because it's just \\"fad\\" music as they put it.  I'm sorry man, but if you listen to music and are worried about whether it's a fad, or underground, then you are just a poseur who probably goes around acting like you are better than everyone because you listen to what you deem as \\"unique\\" and filled with so much more talen.  Bottom line, no one probably likes you because you sound fake.  I listen to all kinds of bands from Yes, to Phish, to the Grateful Dead, to Ween, to Shpongle, Brian eno, even some pantera or metallica on occasions and many others bands inbetween and of different styles, and I would have to say that I still like nirvana thrown in there too.  I like Kurt Cobains voice and the way the songs are put together.  Like they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Oh my God, nirvana was played on MTV and considered a part of some grunge scene?  Oh no, I better throw out the records and stop liking them.  Hahahahaha, some people need to get a life.  You don't like Nirvana's music, well that's your thing.  You don't like Nirvana because you think your music is so much better and that people who like Nirvana are just concerned with fads and don't like music the same way as you.....please take your head out of your butt.
B000002OG5|4.0|Many people have complained that this CD is short, and it is --- 31.5 minutes. On top of that, as is true with most film scores, there are really only three or four themes, with variations in instrumentation, tempo, etc. (you'll hear \\"The Godfather Waltz\\" a LOT), and most of the cuts are fairly short.  <br /> <br />Yet this is a terrific score, and it's very well performed, as well as any album of the material. There's a lightness to the instrumentation, unlike, say, the syrupy strings of Carmine Coppola's arrangements. There's a charming use of folk instrumentation: mandolin, accordion, trumpet. It's a real winner. <br /> <br />My advice is to buy it used. I got a like new copy for $5.99 (shipping included) from Amazon Marketplace, and at that price, it's worth every penny.  <br /> <br />You might also want to start a campaign --- see if a little consumer pressure could be put on Paramount or MCA to search the vaults and release a new GODFATHER soundtrack CD with 15 extra minutes of music. Be forewarned, though: 10 of those minutes will be more of \\"The Godfather Waltz.\\" <br /> <br />
0517123207|5.0|Darwin's Origin of Species is the first book I've read on evolution and being someone that appreciates the scientific manner of explaining observed phenomena with consistent theories, I tried to pay attention to the merits of Darwin's argument. I believed Darwin's theory was generally right(or at least on the right track) before reading this book and after reading it, I'm only more convinced.  <br /> <br />     Although I knew the general ideas put forth by Darwin, I'm now more educated as to the manner in which Darwin came to his conclusions. It was interesting the way in which he considered, for example, how two similar species of mammals or plants could be found on two different continents very far from each other. I particularly liked his consideration of our knowledge of geological history and its relationship to his theory. I also enjoyed learning about the difficulties in distinguishing varieties and species and why it is this distinction may be somewhat arbitrary.  <br /> <br />     One of the things I like about this book was the fact that Darwin addressed the various counterarguments against his theory and usually provided compelling discussions as to why his theory provided better explanation as to the observed nature of things than the idea of Creationism, which he mentions a few times throughout the book. He was meticulous enough to give much thought to potential weaknesses in his theory and yet offer explanation to how these supposed weaknesses may not be as formidable as they initally appear.  <br /> <br />     I found that Darwin's work was rather thought-provoking as I found myself thinking more of mankind's development and the potential uses and development of our own organs and how they may have given us an advantage over other species.  <br /> <br />     Darwin was sometimes a little long-winded in his discussion, but considering the importance of the subject matter, I appreciated his thoughtful and thorough exposition.  <br /> <br />     I'm no expert in evolutionary theories or how Darwin's theory is regarded by experts today. And I don't necessarily think he got everything completely right, but I found his argument generally pretty convincing and think he was closer to being right than wrong. The origin of species, particularly ourselves, is a very important subject and I believe someone would be doing themselves a service to read such an important work.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|From what I have seen on A & E, this band misses Don Felder, I have never seen the Eagles perform this poorly, in my life, I love the eagles & never knew how much Felder inspired for this band!!!  I suggest the band just retire, or go their separate ways, this performance is no way near Hell freezes over!!!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Finally! A Batman movie that the real fans have been waiting for! I always thought the Warner Bros. animated series would always be the best telling of the Batman story, but this movie even gives that a run for it's money. Christian Bale gives a moving performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the best I've seen on the big screen anyway.  <br />My only compliant was the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Why not get someone with a little more depth. Maybe it's because I can only think if her as Joey on Dawson's Creek. I kept expecting her to say something like,\\"Wait! I still love Dawson!\\".  <br />Overall the movie is great. Finally, a realistic Batman who isnt made to look like a dork!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is a very faithful adaption, not to the book, but to the original musical on stage. The actors, despite the critcs' iffy reviews, were amazing in all aspects, as well as the sets, costumes, and cinematography. Joel Schumacer didnt do a very good directing job, but who cares about him anyways. The only thing i'd like to warn buyers is that if they want some AWESOME bonus material, go to amazon.co.uk and buy their DVD. The UK version has everything the US one has, and more...MUCH more. Endless featurettes on the sound, jewelry, prodution, 4 promotional music videos, and more. So anyways, this is still a great movie, and makes me cry everytime I see it because the story alone is just so beautiful and heart-rending.
B00005JKG5|3.0|After all these years I have never seen \\"Flashdance\\" until now. I'm very familiar with the music that I just adore, but as for the movie? Eh. I guess over the years I've been hearing about all of this hype and how great the movie is. That was what the problem was, I was expecting more. I love dance movies that I find entertaining. This is one of them, but not my favorite.  <br /> <br />I liked it for the purpose and I'll end it with that. :)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is an excellent collection to use to introduce non-Beatles fans the the greatest pop group ever. A good price, great songs, fantastic!
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is an album that you actually have to listen to in order to appreciate. With all of the subjectivity I've been reading, it can only mean one thing...Coldplay are no longer musicians, they're artists. Some will be able to appreciate this album and others just won't. Great art always inspires infinite conversation and dialogue. It has to be studied and observed. That takes time and patience. For some, Colplay will be immediately gratifying. Others will reject, scorn, lecture and move on. I think those that really stick with Coldplay and give them a chance will be rewarded musically.  <br /> <br />
B00005LQ04|5.0|I saw this movie last night when I bought this 3 disc set in a Media Play store. It scarred the crap out of me, and the music alone is truly menacing. Everybody did great acting jobs, and just to let you know, the barbed wire scene (chasing Sarah)is probably the scariest, besides the EXTREMELY brutal murder in the very begininng. But, Dario Argento did it tastefully so its not just trashy gore, its actually very good gore with a decent plot as well. I really want to see the third installment of the series, so I hope dear old Dario makes it soon! Inferno, I believe, is the sequal to this one. Anyways, this movie alone is great, the suplemntal features are OK, even for a 3 disc set. I love the DVD cover art...its definitley better than the one on the other Susperis DVD...by the way, I stil have yet to figure out what Susperia actually is... the curse? I guess... Anyways, best scary movie I've seen in a long time.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|I grew up with this movie and I find it one of my personal favorites. If you love dancing. You'll love this. :) <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I got a few laughs out of it, but I don't know what all the fuss was about. It was a little slow too me but overall better than most big budget flicks.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I had been salivating over this boxed set since it came out until recently.  I just broke down and paid the monstrous price tag and I am so glad that I did.  The content in this collection is more than any Alien fan could ask for.  EXTRAS, EXTRAS, EXTRAS!  Boy, are there extras!  One of the big reasons for me (but not the only reason) to get this set (aside from the extras) is the inclusion of an alternate version of Alien 3.  The Special Edition version is the definitive version and is far superior to the original theatrical release.  The opening sequences are more fleshed out and that silly chest bursting scene at the end has been removed.  Much of the footage added to this release makes the movie feel...well...more like a movie that deserves to stand up next to the first two Alien installments.  God bless David Fincher because I know it was hell making this movie.  Even though he wanted no part in this \\"beefed up\\" version, it's far better than the original cut.  Ok, there's only one, and I mean only one drawback to this set and that is the packaging (I refuse to take points off for this because the collection itself is so wonderful).  The outside slipcase/box is just beautiful.  But, when I pulled out the inside fold-out box I was mortified.  It seems like you unfold and flip for days before you finally have the darn thing open (and it's a mile long when you finally do).  I think 2-disc slim cases for each film would have made for a better packing choice.  They would have slipped into the lovely outside box just nicely.  What's so silly about the whole thing is you have to undo the entire fold-out box just to get to the movie you want to watch.  Oh well, this set is immaculate in every other way and should be sitting proudly on every Alien fan's shelf.  Go ahead and pay the hefty price tag and just shake it off.  You'll get over it and you won't be disappointed.
0465011020|4.0|This book is a first-person account of Kang Chol-Hwan's experience of life in DPRK, 10 yearsof horrific existence in a prison camp, his subsequent adjustment to post-release, and lastly his escape from DPRK. The book is a simple, easy to read narrative (I read it on a lazy Sunday afternoon).<br /><br />I had high expectations of this book because of a number of Discovery Channel-related documentaries on the subject of the \\"Hermit Kingdom\\" with detailed interviews, images, accounts, drawings, and secret cameras, focused mostly on the every-day (yet repressive) life. I suppose that I was expecting the same but this time from the POV of the gulag experience.<br /><br />I said initially that this is a good, quick, easy read... a large part of that is because of how it was written. It felt like a very abridged (possibly rushed) narrative that would provide very interesting facts and experiences at one moment, and then jump to a different topic.  I felt that there were certain sections that left me wanting more, such as detailed experiences on the process of indoctrination into the Kim Il-Sung cult of personality, through education, social activities, etc, but perhaps that was not the purpose of this particular book. In addition, I could understand how some emotion or feeling may be \\"lost in translation\\" (this book was originally transcribed from Kang's Korean interviews to French, and now the English version which I read).<br /><br />A pet peeve of mine that I found throughout the book is the difficulty in establishing a sense of timeframes/timelines. The author uses time references inconsistently (lots of reminiscing and jumping back and forth with vague time references), but even in retrospect, I couldn't tell you the date that he and his family were actually imprisoned! Some of this information is inferred by doing your own math and noting dates used here and there throughout the book. Though, to his credit, I could imagine that keeping track of time may be difficult to do in a North Korean Gulag.<br /><br />All that being said, the book is an excellent easy primer for life in a North Korean gulag and insight into life under the Kim Il-Sung regime. I think that Kang conveys as much as he can, but may leave the reader wanting more detail. For further insight, I highly recommend keeping an eye on any Discovery documentaries re. the Hermit Kingdowm. One new revelation that I did walk away with was tht not all North Koreans are brainwashed stooges (contrary to popular thought).icult to do in a North Korean Gulag. <br /> <br />All that being said, the book is an excellent easy primer for life in a North Korean gulag and insight into life under the Kim Il-Sung regime.

B0002OERI0|3.0|This is a big dissapointment. after seeing reviews that claimed this album was a masterpiece, i listened to it and it let me down. some songs are great (holiday) while others are horrendous (boulevard of broken dreams). overall the songs to me sound too alike and though this gives it a coherence tying along to the \\"story\\" it's just not very good. Ambitious but just not that good.
0833567357|5.0|I just bought this book for my grand-nephew, who is starting first grade this year.  I have every hope that he will find it <br />as enjoyable and useful as my son did.  My son did not have any real artistic ability in grade school.  However, he was able to draw scenes and items for school projects that were very acceptable and actually quite good.  My son enjoyed the simple guidance and instruction for drawing some of his favorites, like fire trucks, airplanes, bulldozers... etc.  He still has his first edition 32 years later.  It is a treasure!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Yes there are only two of them. Yes there is no bassist. Anyone who doesn't agree that with the white stripes this is a good choice get out and stop reading. This is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Better than White Blood Cells ( Gasp!), this is the first time the stripes felt and sounded like a full band and that's just by adding fake bass lines and electric piano. Do not miss this. They destroyed the burt bacharach song \\" I just don't know what to do with myself\\" built it up from scratch without using computers and out came out the best song on the album. Highly recommended.
0812550706|5.0|The year is 2070, the alien race we call \\"Buggers\\" has already  attacked Earth twice, and because of their superior technology we feel a third attack would wipe us out for good.  This is the backdrop setting for Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game.  In the book, the Buggers already launched two invasions to Earth and they were both repelled.  Not because of militarilistic might, but because of great and brilliant leaders.  That was 50 years ago.  All of Earth's leaders from the first and second invasion are dead now, and there is no one to lead Earth's forces against the Buggers.  To solve this problem, a school called Battle School is started and its sole purpose is to train leaders for Earth.  Ender is one of the students at Battle School and he is by far the best.  But can he live up to the daunting challange of saving Earth from the Buggers?  You'll have to read to find out!
B00005QXDD|5.0|This CD is one for the ages. If you watched \\"high fidelity\\" you know that JB can sing but did you know that he can throw out the most absurd lyrical musings and turn them into gold along with his partner in crime KG. This album is not for children but you'll realize that very shortly. It's true, most of the songs are about drugs, food, sex, karate and the mythic qualities of the D but when it's so pretty and catchy who cares. My favorite band on earth ( for there are quite a few who live on mars, I'm talking to you Jack White) delivers one of the greatest debuts in history. One can only hope that the pick of destiny will live up to this. Highly recommended.
B0002ZYE1Y|3.0|I purchased this at the weekend and my main gripe about this band is that I do not understand what their songs are getting at.  For example the Wish I had an Angel song has a catchy melody but the lyrics just baffle me, maybe somebody could explain?  Maybe this is because the band come from Finland and cannot put together English lyrics that make any real sense.  They are not the only band that has confused their listeners over the decades.  My other gripe is that the Guitar is a mimic of ZaK Wlyde who was playing these kinds of riffs over a decade ago.  The Europeon rock market just never seems to be as technical as US/UK Metal, as there isn't even any guitar solos on this record.  These European Bands also seem to be about a decade behind the insurgence of rock that the US/UK Mainstream metal market has on offer, hence the copying on this record.  I must admit though that the experimental edge of Rock and Opera does work, but it is a sort of a continuation from the Neo Classical Metal genre of the 80s, which in reality is outdated now.  On the plus side though this isn't a bad album, because the melodies are catchy, which is probably the reason Nightwish's singles have faired quite well in the European Charts.  I also think this vocalist's voice is quite good and moves very well with the music.  But because I cannot get my head around the meaning of their songs and I don't find the guitarist to have any original quality, I can only give this a tentative 3, but perhaps I have listened to more rock over the years then many of these 5 Star reviewers.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold really knows how to get a readers attention.  The introduction of her novel really gripped me and I could not put it down.  The story she tells of this young girl and her family and friends was both heartbreaking, funny at times and very insightful. She really put you in the mind of the young girl and makes you care about her.  With that said, it was like Sebold ran out of ideas or time and just ended the book without tying up a lot of loose ends.  I ended the book angry that the first 9/10's of the book were so brilliant, yet a lot of the characters stories were left unresolved at the end.  I would recommend this book, but be forewarned that you might be left feeling cold too.
0515125024|2.0|I picked this up after reading a rave review of Child's most recent book in the NY Times (Maslin). I enjoy tense, well written thrillers, particularly with noble, loner heroes- like Travis McGee, Matt Scudder, Lew Archer,etc.  I was hoping that Reacher fit the bill. <br /> <br />Not quite. <br /> <br />The good news: The story moves quickly, and if you are looking for lots of action you will be happy. At times, I felt like I was reading a pitch for next seasons plot of \\"24\\". While that may sound like a recomendation, let me tell you that after 400 pages it is not. It is wearisome. <br /> <br />There are many problems with the book- much of it makes no sense, even for a beach read. A prior review mentioned the shrugging fetish- I swear, for 50 pages, the characters shrugged nearly every interaction. I thought it was a joke. <br /> <br />That's not the worst, however. No, there is one thing that kills any book (or movie), and it appears here twice. <br /> <br />I'll set the scene. Reacher and Holly are locked in the trunk or the back of a van for a trip from Chicago to Montana. Little sleep or food and no bath. Sadistic killers driving them to god knows where. But they are handcuffed together, and presumably they have talked through all the escape options, so there is only one thing to do: make out. That's right, they kiss, and they keep kissing until the truck they are held hostage in takes a sharp turn. Damn. <br /> <br />Later on, an ally is discovered by the bad guys. Not to ruin the suspense, but Reacher and Holly find the poor soul cruicified and gutted in the woods, flies buzzing all around. So after burying him, what do you think our heroes do? I swear, on page 268, they actually make love. I'm not kidding. And if that isn't the most unintentionally disturbing love scene in history, I don't want to know what is. <br /> <br />All in all, I will not be seeking out any more Reacher books.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A lot of people don't \\"get\\" this movie. I guess it is too deep & intricate for these shallow thinkers. Don't worry, Fast & the Furious is waiting on ya pal. This is simply my favorite movie of all time. No movie has EVER captured a mood like this movie has. Sofia Coppola's recipe of vivid imagery and wonderfully ambient music makes you feel as if you are there in Tokyo. Coppola has impeccable taste in music, as evidenced by the Soundtrack (one of my favorite CDs ever). Watch this movie - It will take you away to another place. You won't be disappointed. ~ <br />
B00068NVI4|5.0|...the night before was one of the most amazing Concerts I ever saw. And the end of And You and I. I have never witnessed such crowd appreciation. The Jaded New Yorkers that went to Bowie, U2 and Eagles this past year did not show up! Thank God! No Ultra down-town attitude. What we got Was The Most Genuine Rock show with both the players and audience in synch. thanks guys keep up the good work! Tsongas was the concert after the Garden. and I cannot wait to watch it!
B00030590I|4.0|The first time I saw this film I didn't understand it or get the point. I thought it was the same thing over again throughout the movie. I still agree that there is a lot of the same thing over in the movie, but that is part of the theme. It is pretty much about a warrior who talks to the king about stories of three other assasins. EVERY actor in this movie delivers a mighty fine job. There is no doubt that this is a beautiful movie. Even though there are a lot of battle scenes, there is still a beauty and art to it without it being gory. The picture is alive with life and color. The color usage/theme is very well done. (I wish I saw it in the theatre). You'll see scenes and themes of red, jade, blue, white, yellow, etc. The outfits worn also contribute in those themes...they are also beautiful as well. The sound and music are nicely set, most of it is poignant. There is a lot of emotion in the movie, but it is certainly not sappy or anything like that. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into the film, but it sure payed off. This movie is a piece of moving art. And for those that like a lot of sword play action, you'll really appreciate this because there is plenty of it in this movie. I'd recommend. I also have to recommend you pay close attention because it could be a little confusing. If you don't like subtitles, then watch the dubbed edition (very well dubbed). I also saw the one in Chinese with subtitles and I noticed there were some shots that were not in the dubbed edition. If you ONLY like teen movies, gore, horror, romantic comedies and such, then I would not recommend. Otherwise, you should really see it.
0312323859|5.0|Even though everyone gave this book glowing reviews and said it was the perfect follow-up, I was still slightly skeptical...I couldn't wait to read it however, and I read it in a day!  I just couldn't wait to find out more about what happened and how this ending could be perfect.  When I first read that Darcy was going to England to stay with Ethan, it really made me skeptical, because in Something Borrowed, Darcy and Ethan weren't really that good of friends.  But Giffin did an amazing job at keeping Darcy and everyone true to form.  I almost think she wrote them back to back and just waited to release this one :)  If you haven't read Something Borrowed, rush out and get both of these wonderful books.  They will make you laugh and cry.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites and one of the best I've seen. I will say that when I saw the commercial for this movie, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. I only saw it because my boyfriend wanted to see it at the theatres, so we went. After I saw it at the theatre, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not...but then it stated to grow on me for a bit. It wasn't until my boyfriend got the DVD and we watched it again I realized I had to buy it myself. I don't know how many times I've seen it. The movie is basically about a woman who aims to get revenge at a group of assasins who betrayed her. I can use some desciptions out of many for this movie: sassy, quick, colorful, different, emotional (and not in a sappy type of way). The picture, the color, the characters, the different types of genres incorporated all worked well. I thought the color usage was excellent(blue backdrops, black and white scene, character outfits contrasting the backround, scenes as a whole, etc)...the picture was excellent. The characters all worked well in their own different ways and it was interesting how they each contributed to the film. You'll have a few quirky scenes or people (the 5,6,7,8's for example). The outfits were certainly interesting (O-Ren's white kimono (and black one too), The Bride's yellow jumpsuit, Gogo's schoolgirl outfit, Elle's nurse attire, etc). I personally loved the music. All of the music fit WELL with the scenes...some matched the emotion of the scene and some contrasted it but it still blended in well. Favorite was \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\"...a mix of dance, disco, rock and Spanish style incorporated into it. Oh and for those who were confused by the beeps in the beginning and the other one later on, it was just a BEEP TO COVER UP THE BRIDE'S NAME. I was a little suprised to see another DVD film with someone else wearing the same yellow jumpsuit with the black stripe on it (I don't remember what the movie was called. I guess Tarantino borrowed that costume idea from another movie, but I guess other than that, I would recommend for people who like movies with some sword/katana play, \\"kung-fu\\" type action, anime (anime scene for about 10 min or so). I've heard many reviews saying that this movie was supposed to be funny as well, so you might find some comedy in it? I didn't think it was a comedy...it did have a bit of funny moments but it wasn't hilarious or anything like that, in my opinion. Also, a lot of people tend to think this movie has some violent scenes, so if you don't have much patience for violent events on screen, then I caution you. Otherwise, I'd recommend you probably rent it before you buy because it is more of the type of movie that not everyone would like (more of a love it or hate it type).
B00006690G|4.0|this is the third album of the increadible slim shady but as good as it was it did not compare to the marshal mathers lp. however it did have sevral stand out tracks  <br />3.buisness  <br />5.square dance  <br />10.without me <br />15.when the music stops <br />19.my dad's gone crazy
B00005JNTX|4.0|They had genious advertising for this movie (which is what got me highly intrigued in the first place). The trailer song was hot, and the actual visuals on the trailer were good as well. I'm actually surprised because comic books and these types of movies do not really interest me but there was something that really made me want to see the movie. I'm glad I went to see it. At first when I walked out of the theatre I didn't know what to think, but I realized I really liked the movie. The picture and visuals worked really well. The movie was in black and white, but there were occasional clever uses of color (blue eyes, red lips, yellow face, etc). It was really much like a comic book made to life. I can't imagine how much work this must have taken. Some of the dialogue might have been a little cornballish, but I can imagine this is the case because it seems like this movie was supposed to be set in a different time, so the talking was a bit different. Some people may find it really violent but I didn't. So if you are really put off by violent scenes and such, be cautioned. There are three different stories in this movie... I thought the acting was really well done and I happened to like most of the characters. I think the character that surprised me the most was Elijah Wood's. Elijah Wood plays an unusual character...very much unlike Frodo. Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke also contribute some good acting. Other actors in this movie include Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki and Bruce Willis among many others. A highly attractive cast in this movie which also adds to the glamorous visuals. Most likely you will end up having a favorite character. I'd certainly recommend seeing the film. If you liked the movies Kill Bill, or most movies of that kind, or you are also a comic book fan, then I think you would appreciate it. It's not built like your average Hollywood movie.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I wanted to leave the theater thinking to myself, \\"fan-freaking-tastic\\", but \\"pretty damn awesome\\" will have to do.  The critics who say the movie never quite ignites as a barn burner have a point--there's the usual car chase, the obligatory climactic fistfight--but these genre-staple scenes are well-done, and the movie remains engrossing thanks to psychological drama.  The violent scenes are indeed cut in a punch-pulling way that blunts their visceral impact.  Keep in mind that this was likely done to keep the PG-13 rating, not because the director has no sense of action.  Fittingly enough, Batman Begin's most thrilling moment has the Dark Knight dangling a criminal upside down like a yo-yo, interrogating him fiercly. In this moment the transformation to Batman is fully realized in a powerful, entertaining way.  The writing is excellent overall and there are precious few eye-rolling moments (I counted maybe two.)  The comic relief one-liners serve their purpose-they're actually funny!  And sure, Katie Holm's voice has that slightly annoying helium to it, but she plays the part just fine (and is fun to look at.)  So, the movie is not quite the jaw-dropping genre transcender I was looking for.  But it's smart, psychological and full of memorable moments.  At least the bar isn't set impossibly high.  If they keep the same director and tighten things up a bit, the series will be one to treasure.  They need only remember what made this movie work-it bothers to create characters the audience cares about, and it gives those characters good lines to deliver.  \\"I'm not going to kill you.  But I don't have to save you.\\"
B00005JMUA|2.0|I was not thrilled after seeing this in the theatre, therefore not adding Kill Bill 2 to my DVD collection. I think it is alright that I just have one Kill Bill in my DVD collection. In my opinion, Kill Bill 1 was so much better and it is seriously one of my favorite movies. I don't even remember how many times I've watched that movie. I cannot say the same about Kill Bill 2. This movie has its good moments, but I can't sit through it and wait for my favorite scenes (which happen to be very few). Obviously, KB2 is the continuation of the first movie. I'm not going to give out any spoilers here. The styles of the two movies are rather different. I will say that there is less action than KB1, more talking, more of a Western film type feel, less sassiness and quickness to it, less uses of color than KB2, more gritty than KB1. KB2 reminded me of Pulp Fiction and other movies like that. However, KB2 provided a bit more answers to the audience in terms of The Bride and Bill. The acting is fairly good, but some of the dialogue lines seem to be rather \\"cornballish\\" (more on the Bride's and Bill's part). As for the music...there are some decent songs and backround music that work well. I'd say that even KB1's music was better, KB2 music was still good. I don't know if Tarantino made such a contrast to attract more viewers or made a contrast for the sake of making a contrast so you have one type of genre for the first movie and another type of genre for the second, and as a whole it works well together? There are a lot of people who liked this movie and there are some who didn't. I wouldn't say NOT to see it, but watch it and see if you are a fan or not. So even though I didn't like this movie, I won't dismiss the fact that the directors and the actors put effort into it. Yes, I can appreciate that a lot of work went into making KB2, but I just could not get into it.
B000654Z2I|5.0|If you're a fan of Can and own this on another CD version, well, cash it in and buy this remastering because it sounds simply WONDERFUL!  Although you better save some money for a visit to the chiropractor afterward, because the version of \\"Halleluwah\\" here will WRING YOUR NECK and leave you mumbling \\"...the drums...the drums...the drums....\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Oh Yeah\\" is a thing of rare psychedelic beauty, with details I never even imagined before.  The rest of the CD is of similar amazing quality.  <br /> <br />Simply KILLER remastering job!
B000001H03|4.0|The G Major Flute Concerto on this CD is truly wonderful; I have heard over 10 G Majors and the soloist here is not the greatest I've ever heard (if you're looking for those, see Rampal, Bennett, and Nicolet), but he and the VPO know each other well (as they should - he was a regular in the orchestra), and they produce a warm, easy, delightful performance of the G Major. I can say even more for the clarinet concerto: it is the best I've heard. Though I have heard only two other versions of it, those versions tend to be highly regarded, and neither can match this one which has Bohm bringing his full store of magic to the great Adagio.  <br /> <br />Then we get to the bassoon concerto. Compared to the Decca version with the Cleveland Orchestra and Dohnanyi, this performance is downright terrible. The soloist seems insecure on some of the faster technical passages, he has a bad sound, and his interpretation is timid and uniformly uninteresting. Bohm of course does well as usual, but he is only able to fill the cup halfway. Listen to eight bars of the Decca and you can't but notice the difference: Dohnanyi's soloist has a fat warm sound with no technical trouble and a lively spirit about the whole thing - almost the opposite of what is presented here. I can't believe they would let such a musician into the Vienna Philharmonic, or even if I could believe that, I couldn't believe they should ever let him stand out front. <br /> <br />5 stars for the clarinet and flute concerti, 2.5 for Bohm's half of the bassoon concerto.
B000850IHW|5.0|This has never been one of my favorite GG albums--that would be \\"In a Glass House\\" or \\"Octopus\\", depending on my mood--but after hearing this remaster I may have to reconsider.  The new remastering is so good I feel like I've never heard it before, with a wonderfully warm low end, plenty of high end sparkle, and all the details in between.   <br /> <br />If you're a GG fan and you're wondering if you need to buy it, because you already have it on CD or vinyl, well, YOU DO,  believe me.  Me?  I'm buying ALL the reissues in this series myself! <br /> <br />Gentle Giant Lives!!!
B00006BTCA|4.0|There are few reviews of Interpol's Turn On The Bright Lights  that do not end up comparing Interpol to Joy Division/Echo and the Bunymen (specifically Joy Division). Yet many are too quick to deem Interpol's record poser post punk that is derivative and unnappreciative of its predecessors. These reviews do have a valid basis in a way; Interpol does serve up memories of old Unknown Pleasures and Closer. Yet for the most part, the album remains fresh and vivid, transcending poser post punk and whatver else deriding critics say about it. The album is far too fresh and compelling to be overlooked. Most of the songs here are superbly constructed, both tight and intense, with the dark edge of yesteryear post punk. Suprisingly, the album has very few low points. Nearly all the songs are alt rock gems that are moody and sophisticated. It is quite accesible while at the same being different and creative on its own. It is suprisingly natural, unlike present day bands such as The Killers (whose similar music is so polished and stressed it sounds painful). It's hits, Obstacle 1, and NYC do remain powerful singles, yet what TOTBT has, and what most bands nowadays lack, is a powerful group of songs to surround its core. Untitled and Hands Away are both similar quiet guitar driven ballads that display a keen eye for hooks, yet remain relative worlds apart from commercial radio rock. PDA may well be the albums brightest spot, capturing all the energy that makes Interpol so vital and fresh, both lyrically and sonically. All in all, Interpol has created a rather moody and sophisticated album that is a few pieces short of an actual masterpiece. There are too many compelling songs here to dismiss the album as a poser post punk debacle. Yet in that very same aspect, it fails to reach monumental status in that it isn't groundbreaking. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean it isn't good. THe album remains literate, stirring and complex, and while it isnt Joy Division, it is strong enough on its own to be worthy of 4 stars.
1573223026|4.0|Let me start by saying that Hornby is outstanding at what he does.  His wit is razor sharp.  His ear for dialogue and his empathy for his wide-ranging characters are among the best in the business.  And his capacity to gather extreme emotions and emotional events, put them in fitting boxes, squeeze the best juice out of them and then push all that through his fingers and into the keys of his word processor is quite amazing.      That said, I thought in this book he was doing a little too much of all of that primarily for the purpose of showing off.  Frankly, if I had half his talent, I'd be tempted to do the same.  But this made, for me at least, a very nice series of extremely well done moments and turns of phrase that did not hang together entirely as a single cohesive work.    Not that he can't be excused of this -- he was taking on an awful lot.  The attempt to write a single coherent novel from four different perspectives and to keep the pages turning is not a task that I expect would be easy.  And he largely pulls it off.  But, at the end, this book felt to me less than the sum of its parts.    As for whether or not it is a downer, I'm having a little trouble seeing the \\"not a downer\\" side of the coin.  It's a downer alright.  The utter despair of screw ups when they reach the epiphany that they can't even screw up properly is, in a word, heartbreaking.  Yes, there is a life affirming (of sorts) end message, and some modest redemption, but there is a bleakness to this novel that one should be prepared for if at all sensitive to that sort of thing.    One final word and the real reason I can't give this book more than 4 stars.  Hornby's self consciousness about writing a book with no easy resolutions or Hollywood style happy endings comes off as too over-the-top.  His characters remind us nearly a half dozen times that this is not that kind of book, and of course, what that really is is Hornby himself bragging about how it's not that kind of book.  That's fine,but a little more understatement about his anti-conventional streak -- which most of us who've been with Hornby for many years already understand -- seemed to be in order.
B000001ELL|5.0|Kiss has gone from classic rock, hard rock, heavy metal, pop, possibly almost every genre of music. Here, they flirted with elements of the disco craze of the late 1970s, and they fared very well. Not a favorite of every Kiss fan, DYNASTY is one album that shouldn't be overlooked. Every track is diverse in its own right, and all are written and performed very well. <br /> <br />I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU - The definitive Kiss disco song that sounds somewhat dated today but still remains an enjoyable, well-known classic. <br /> <br />2000 MAN - Ace took a crack at remaking a Stones song, and with his creative touch, made it sound like his own. <br /> <br />SURE KNOW SOMETHING - Another disco/rock track that pops up here and there on a Kiss hits compilation. Not as fast-paced as I WAS MADE, but it is still an enjoyable, nearly forgotten track from the band. <br /> <br />DIRTY LIVIN' - Peter Criss' only vocals on the album with a bluesy-like guitar and his rough vocals making it an enjoyable listen. <br /> <br />CHARISMA - Catchy, sing-along chorus and a seductive guitar make this \\"filler\\" track very enjoyable. <br /> <br />MAGIC TOUCH - Medium-paced rocker with a thunderous vocal from Paul Stanley. <br /> <br />HARD TIMES - Ace rocks away on this track and sings in his usual humorous way. <br /> <br />SAVE YOUR LOVE - Repetitive chorus, but the track is still catchy. <br /> <br />XRAY EYES - Gene takes over in this track, and most of the rhythms here sound similar to those in UNMASKED. <br /> <br />DYNASTY is a worthy purchase. Every Kiss fan should own this, but even the casual listener should find this to be an enjoyable collection with barely, if any, filler tracks.
0671027387|4.0|I picked up \\"Deception Point\\" after reading Brown's other works to see if this was just as good.  The plot sounded promising, and I was hoping that Brown could weave in some conspiracy-theory backstory to it to make it even more interesting.  While \\"Deception Point\\" is a decent thriller, it never goes the extra distance to become anything more than that.  The book starts off very strong and I read through the first couple hundred pages in one sitting, but after that some of the intrigue that was built up early on is lost when Brown reveals what's actually going on and we learn the secret behind the object found in the Arctic.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Deception Point\\" would make for an above-average made-for-TV movie, and is a decent suspense novel, but doesn't come off as exciting as his other works.
0739316443|2.0|If you like Grisham, read \\"The Last Juror\\".  It is a much better read.  If you want an Italian lesson, read \\"The Broker\\".  This book didn't have a plot until three-quarters through.  If you thought \\"The Street Lawyer\\" was weak, this fare is even worse.
B000069AUI|4.0|In my opinion, this cd is better than the band's last effort, Parachutes.  It contains some wonderful songs: Clocks, In My Place, and God Put A Smile Upon Your Face.  These were all released as singles (I think) but other songs on the cd shine just as brightly.  Among my favorites: A Rush Of Blood To The Head, Amsterdam, and Green Eyes.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I ABSOLUTELY loved this movie and wanted to give it 5 stars. However, it's Mr Nolan's first summer blockbuster and unfortunately this movie is not without its faults. <br />1st, as many others would agree, the fight sequences are a bit too shaky and closed up, I wished Mr Nolan would pull the camera back a little to reveal more what was going on. Batman is a martial artist after all, especially this batman with such brutal and lethal and wraith like fighting styles. I understand what he intended but it didn't work out that nicely <br />2nd, as I have stated in many comic book movies, I wanted to see the superhero instead of his alter ego. This movie is about 50/50, and I can stand with that, not to mention it's an origin tale. So I hope they would show more batman with batman problems. <br /> <br />Ok, it almost sounded like I hate this movie, but as I stated in my first sentence, this movie is a must see both comic book fan and non comic book fan. Put it simple, this movie upgrades a summer blockbuster to a mixture of summer action thriller and dramma with a psycological level in such a way that it almost include all the movie genre one can possibly think of. If you are looking for horror, it's there, if you are looking for action, it's there, if you are looking for science fiction, it's there, and many others. and you might think such a mix would ruin the movie but not here. make no mistake, the mixture is simply perfect. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is of some arguments and I am positive with it. It may not have a clear main theme and may not have danny's mystic heroic gritty feel, but it stands out in the movie. I wouldn't recommand the soundtrack on it's own, but you will definitely be absorbed into the movie as the soundtrack gives you the exact feel of the scene. <br /> <br />The cast is simply amazing to look at. some may dislike katie but i wouldn't think it's her fault, she is a fine actress who just couldn't stank out with such a huge cast. imagine yourself as an slightly above average actor and put into this situation... <br />Christian rocks as his three-part role as the main character: Private and Public Bruce and intimidating batman. Caine is more like a father figure than a butler and fits perfectly in the context. Cillian Murphy is solid as scarecrow and very scary sometimes. Liam Neeson is as wonderful as always doing mentor character and, to me, very tragic and both likable and hateful as another secret character. Gary Oldman is extremely likable in this movie and you will simply want him more. Morgan Freeman is as charm as he always is and did an awesome job. all other supporting cast did a wonderful job espeically bruce's father, and i only remember the name thomas wayne as his name because he is the one that made me feel truely emotional just the way young bruce did. <br /> <br />The gadgets of batman in this movie realy stand on their own and you may dislike them but after watching the movie your idea will change 180 degrees just like me, especially the tumbler and the suit. <br /> <br />it's my first long review and hope it's helpful. thank you for your time reading this, and hope you enjoy the film. i did.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this cd almost two weeks ago and have listened to it over and over again.  Almost every song on here is a jewel.  Each song, no matter the subject, displays Coldplay's powerful passion and intensity.  This cd sticks to the themes commonly seen in Coldplay's music: love and concern for mankind.  The lyrics and the way they are sung are heartfelt, honest and sincere.  My favorite songs on the cd are: Square One, White Shadows, Speed of Sound, and A Message.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys Coldplay's music!!!
630170648X|5.0|Benny himself said this was the only movie he ever made that became a classic. He is correct. This film was made years before the true extent of Nazi atrocities in Europe became known so some may find the portrayl of Hitler and The Waffen SS as something like the Three Stooges to be a insulting but this film is a product of it's time. Only negative was none of Benny's Radio cast was in the film. I think this film would have had more spice with Eddie Rochester Anderson, Phil Harris, Dennis Day, and Frank Nelson in it. One great thing is we all get one last look at the lovely Carole Lombard. She was the love of Clark Gable's life and like Gable a car enthusiast who in her lifetime owned Bugattis, Duesenbergs, and V-16 Fleetwood Cadillacs.
0060989157|4.0|INTRODUCTION:  For over twenty years,Motley Crue has definitely been one of the best and one of the most succesful bands of all time.They have left behind great music,and Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and Mick Mars are four men who we owe a \\"Thank You\\" to for letting us have fun in the 80's.And in the year 2002,The Crue released their interesting,detailed,entertaining,and shocking autobiography,\\"The Dirt\\". How does the book measure up? Read on for my review of this:    THOUGHTS,COMMENTS,and OPINIONS:  When this book was released in 2002,I didn't rush to the bookstore to buy it,and as a matter of fact,I didn't buy it until a couple of months ago. When I started reading it,I thought that it would be interesting and I expected that I would like it,but really,I didn't think that I would be that impressed by Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and Mick Mars-four men who encouraged me to become a musican myself and who also encouraged me to break in the music industry myself(which I'm currently closer to doing)to be great writers. Gene Simmons had chosen to bash Ace Frehley and Peter Criss so many times in his \\"KISS and Make-Up\\" autobiography,and that is probably why I wasn't expecting a whole lot here. Anyway,this is a really good rock autiobiography. Not only were Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and Mick Mars very honest with this book,I enjoyed the pictures that were in here,all of the stories,and I liked how they brought in other people they had worked with(John Corabi,the guy who took over for Vince Neil afte Vince had been fired from the group,Doc McGhee and Doug Thaler,who are two of their former managers,etc.)to add more interesting facts and stories to this book. It is really hard to summarize all of my opinions in just one paragraph,so that me do what the guy at the top did and give a rundown of every original band member of Motley Crue:    Nikki Sixx is one of those people who took something really bad that happened in his life and that it revolve around his personality.When Sixx was three years old,his father abandoned him and his mother,which lead through Sixx going through a really rough childhood.All of that resulted in Sixx doing things like slashing his wrist at age seventeen and telling the police his own mother did it just so he could have freedom(which worked),getting in trouble and looking the wrong way when he was in a bad situatuion,and wanting to be in charge-I won't give away everything,but if there is a lesson to be learned by the things that Nikki Sixx has admitted that he used to do in this book,then it is don't let one(or more)bad thing/things in your life turn you into a bad person,no matter how hard the bad thing You went thorugh was.    All of what Mick Mars had to say in this book surprised me. Mars kinds of reminds me of Ace Frehley-he may be a little bit of a trouble,and he may be a little bit messed up,but deep down inside there is a person with a good heart. Meet a guy who did a lot of stupid things,which included:hanging out with drug dealers(which his fellow bandmates did also)having a child at age twelve,and a guy who was totally flushed in by his family,his friends,and his life-and You're be in for a bigger surprise then You expected with this book(Mars' stories are part of what made this book better than I expected).Really,as the other guy at the top mentioned,it really is a surprise and maybe even a little bit of a miracle that Mars was able to stay with the band during their whole career.    Vince Neil's story just starts with the wrong place,some of the wrong decisions,and some of the wrong people,and that me support my opinions from there:Neil spent a large portion of his childhood in Compton,Califronia(which most of us know as a dangerous suberb of Los Angeles)and after hanging out with some gangs in the neighborhood who were his own age,that is where the trouble beings:in this book,Neil admits some of the things he did with that gang and the things he did when he was not with them but when he had started hanging out with them,and after becoming so \\"independent\\" to the point where his parents gave up at disciplining him,Neil's dangerous and naughty \\"adeventures\\" carry on-and half of it stopped when his dauughter Skylar died of cancer,and then it picks up again and calms down-it is really hard to say what got Neil to clean up,but You kind of admire him and the good things he did after he straightned up-Neil,like Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and Mick Mars,was tired of getting into so much trouble and eventually became a new and better person.    Tommy Lee-wow. This was a guy who was spolied by his parents as a child so much that when it came time for him to be out in the real world,he remained a spoiled brat who would just pout like a child when he didn't get what he wanted.I could have gone without Lee using the \\"F\\" word so many times in this book and saying the word \\"dude\\" so much,but some of the things in here are interesting-Lee that us read some of the letters he wrote to Pamela Anderson when he was in jail after he had beat her up and some of the rap influenced songs he wrote in there were included as a part of this book(which were so bad that they were funny)-some of the things Lee said in this book were interesting,just don't expect everything in here that is said by him to be true(Lee even claims that the reason why he beat up Pamela Anderson was because she hit him before he hit her and that is apparently why Anderson was left with rugburns on her back and why she was kicked in the butt when she was carrying one of her and Lee's children. Lee and Anderson were kind of both children.But hey,people learn from their mistakes,right?    OVERALL:  There were a few things that could have been better with this book,but overall,it is a really good rock autobiography. Most of the books I read are about rock stars-and I must say,my time and money with this book were well spent.Ladies and gentleman,this is the ultimate place to turn if You want to learn more about The Crue-they are one of my favorite bands of all time,and I was very satisfied with this book.To put the words of Metal Edge staff writer and Connecticut based music journalist Roger Lotring in my own words,Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and Mick Mars were never appropriate role models for our lives or anybody's life-but really,that is the reason why we still find ourselves jamming to \\"Wild Side\\" and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" in the car,and the reason why we still get out an air guitar at 2:00 in the morning and find ourselves playing it to \\"Looks That Kill\\" and \\"Primal Scream\\".
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale, \\"Batman Begins\\") hasn't slept in a year, disrupting his appetite, causing him to lose 70 pounds. He works at a factory, on a machine, making parts for other parts. During the night, he fills his hours with the attentions of Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a prostitute, and Marie (Aitana Sanchez Gijon), the Graveyard shift waitress at a local caf&eacute;. One day, a co-worked has an accident, which may have been caused by Trevor. Feelings of guilt join his paranoia and send him into a tailspin.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\" was made long before \\"Batman Begins\\" and the most striking thing about the film is what Bale did to his body to become Trevor. He lost 70 pounds, causing his body to become emaciated, bones showing through pallid skin. The physical transformation is amazing and painful to watch.<br /><br />Looking past the physical, Bale has once again created a believable, interesting, three dimensional character. Trevor moves through his life as if walking through a thick fog, a condition of his exhaustion. Many times, he is about to fall asleep when some sound, some disturbance jolts him awake. He also begins to imagine things, adding to his paranoia. Bale keeps the performance very low key adding elements of realism to the character. It would be completely unbelievable to watch a character who is physically exhausted start screaming and jumping around hysterically at any point. His pain and guilt, after his co-worker's accident, are also very low key, until he begins to suspect that someone may be plotting something against him. As the paranoia begins to take hold, his performance becomes a little more manic, but Bale still keeps it low key.<br /><br />Directed by Brad Anderson (\\"Session 9\\", \\"Happy Accidents\\"), the film's cinematography is almost monochromatic. Virtually all color has been drained from the screen. Some scenes have a touch of green or a touch of red, but everything is predominantly black, white and gray. Imagine if you haven't slept for a year. How screwed up would everything appear in your eyes? As we are watching the film through Trevor's POV, it is necessary for us to see his world as he views it. Anderson accomplishes this beautifully through this cinematic style.<br /><br />As the story progresses, we begin to sense that something may be underlying Trevor's paranoia. The film is a mystery of sorts, as Trevor works to uncover what this is. This element of is interesting and well-done, worked throughout to seem believable.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\" is an interesting, involving, well-made film starring one of the better actors working in film today. Definitely worth renting.u haven't slept for a year. How screwed up would everything appear in your eyes?

B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer is an amazing composer and has handled the soundtracks to many motion pictures.  In my opinion, his work on the \\"Gladiator\\" soundtrack is his best to date.  Lush voices often overlay beautiful sounding orchestra pieces.  The drums somewhat African inspired and it adds further to the powerfulness of the work.  The music has a decidedly transcendentalist feel about it; some track will have your heart racing and others will make you dream.  \\"Elysium\\" and \\"Now we are Free\\" are amazing, however they seem like they could be the same song.  I get chills when I listen to \\"Now we Are Free\\".  All of the other tracks are just as strong in this great soundtrack.
1573223026|1.0|I am very surprised by all the good reviews this book is getting. I am a huge fan of High Fidelity and About A Boy, but this book was such a disappointment. It seemed like such lazy writing~I would NEVER think this was the same author.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|There have been 4 Jesse Stone novels by Robert Parker. And though Stone is 35 years old in the first one, and in his mid 40s by now, Selleck takes and makes the role his own. He's perfect in the role, and the whole production of this made for TV movie is top notch. there need to be more smart mystery type shows like this around. <br /> <br />When it aired, there were early reports that Selleck was interested in doing more with the character. Perhaps a series of TV movies, or even a TV series. It aired on CBS, and fans of Spenser For Hire (when is that whole series coming to DVD?)would love to see a regular weekly series. Personally, I don't know how well it would hold up weekly. There are only 4 books out to base this on, compared to the more than a dozen when Spenser aired. But with the right scripts it could become a great weekly show. And a hit. But CBS would probably aim for 21 episodes a season, which might strain the concept a little. <br /> <br />But either way, this movie was excellent. Fans of Parker,Selleck or just a good mystery should check it out.
6302902010|4.0|Regardless of George's or Otto's versions of Porgy and Bess, it would be great to have access to ALL versions.  Some have said that Otto's version is the \\"Reader Digest\\" version, well this version got me interested ( as a child) in the more \\"Operaic\\" version and it is NOT harmful to spoon feed those who you are attempting to gain some interest in Opera.  You know Opera can be overwhelming to some folks.  Otto's version is not available, for whatever reason, but should be and I would love to have it in my collections.  It is important that everyone get exposed to all genre of musice and theatrical productions in the best way as possible.  I commend those actors and actresses in Otto's version for a fine performance...oh some of them when on to become great actors and actresses...hmmmm
B00006RU5B|5.0|I had my doubts about this super band because of the contrasting styles, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Right of the bat, this album rocks through and through.  \\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How to Live\\" and \\"Gasoline\\" are RATM rooted songs that absolutely blow your ears out and when Chris Cornell screams as he did in his earlier years, you realize that you will not be able to get these songs out of your head.  \\"What You Are\\" is another good one, though it got killed by the radio stations.  \\"Like A Stone\\" is a nice break from the heavy stuff with a good riff and solid lyrics.  \\"Set It Off\\" is another rocker that sets up possibly the two best songs on the album.  \\"Shadow Of The Sun\\" absolutely grips you with it's chorus.   The music and the lyrics just won't let you go.  Absolutely amazing song.  \\"I Am The Highway\\" is probably the best ballad since Pearl Jam's \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\".  Cornell's lyrics are incredible on this one.  It's probably my favorite, but it's hard to say with so many amazing songs on this album.  The next three songs are nice filler songs, but nothing notable.  \\"Light My Way\\" is another pounding RATM root in the \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" mold.  It's another one of my favs.  \\"Getaway Car\\" is an amazing slow, bluesy song.  This is the song that Chris Cornell shines on.  It's all his lyrics and definitely his influence.  A nice change of pace.  The finale, \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" is a nice way to end a superb debut album.  It an epic buildup with a fitting ending.  There is no reason for you not to own this album, unless of course you hate Chris Cornell, Soundgarden and RATM.  But, if that's the case, you SUCK anyway.  Highly recommended.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Just like Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head, this album took some getting used to, but it's well worth the multiple listens. I can't stop playing it now! X&Y is in constant rotation in my home stereo and my car. Once again, an absolutely PHENOMENAL Coldplay disc.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album definitely grows on you each time you listen to it.  The two singles (\\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Your Time Has Come\\") are good songs, but don't form your opinion of the album based on those two songs.  \\"Your Time Has Come\\" has a great chorus and is very Cochise-esque. \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", \\"Dandelion\\" and \\"The Curse\\" are some of my favs on the album.  They're very catchy and I'd say the first two will get a ton of air time.  \\"#1 Zero\\" is another awesome song (maybe the best) with a slow bluesy riff that builds up into a full blown legendary Cornell screamfest.  \\"The Worm\\", \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" and \\"Man or Animal\\" are three of the harder songs on the album.  You can definitely hear Soundgarden and RATM roots in some of the songs, but it seems they've found their new sound.  \\"Heaven's Dead\\" is a decent  ballad, but kind of cheesy and forgetable.  \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\" is another solid Cornell ballad.  The only song that sucks on the album is the title track.  Overall, it's not as good as the first album, but that's nothing to be ashamed about.  I recommend you at least give it a listen or two.
0062502182|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I am a Spanish teacher and this book was loaned to me by another Spanish teacher.  Maybe one reason this book touched me so is because I am currently living in Spain (in Andalucia) with my husband in the U.S. Military and I have traveled to the cities in Spain that are mentioned in the book and to Tangier and I experience the levanter winds regularly.  I am enthusiastic about Spanish history and the Moorish culture in Southern Spain.  So, the tid bits mentioned in the book about these things brought a smile to my face.   <br /> <br />Being a language teacher I was interested in the use of the \\"Universal Language\\" by the author and in the \\"About the Author\\" section of the book Paul Coelho is quoted as saying that \\"following your dream is like learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end.\\"  An idea I can certainly relate to in language and life. <br /> <br />The book is simplistic and a \\"fable\\" is the best word for it.  But it's simplicity is what is so refreshing about it.  It is an easy read and can be read in one or two days.  I am recommending this to my students especiallly those about to go to college - where mistakes can be made and pathways to dreams may get tangled.   <br /> <br />If you look at this book for an intricate plot you won't find it.  It's, again, simplistic but beautiful.  But don't miss out on this book by trying to disect it, simply allow it to let your own thoughts soar.
B0002ZEYYQ|3.0|When living things evolve, they do so to adapt to changes in their environment, though not necessarily to get better.  Music, as a living entity, is no different.  So to hear the new Jamrioquai is reminiscent of such an evolution: to change, though not necessarily to improve. <br />Let me first start by stating that I did not find this outing on par with the first three Jamiroquai offerings, which is not entirely fair.  \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\", \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\", and \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" were nothing short of legendary.  After two more base hits, this die-hard JK fan was looking for a homer. <br />I think I got a good triple here. <br />It's hard to argue that the hard funk and infections basslines of the first three CDs are gone.  I see flashes of infection on \\"Dynamite\\", \\"Seven Days in Sunny June\\", and \\"Time Won't Wait\\".  But no legend, which is not entirely a bad thing.  Artists don't attempt to recreate classics; rather, they just press on and forward. <br />I may get drawn and quartered for saying this, but the 'change' happened when Stuart Zender left the group.  I believe Jay and Stu cited creative difference for the parting.  We could all do better with their creative similarity.
0440241413|3.0|I have been hearing reviews of this book, saying it is absolutely brilliant. I was really looking forward to reading it, but I have to say it wasn't as &quot;great&quot; as many people think.<br />The book introduces a fun character who has a huge shopping problem. First of all, I thought it wasn't realistic. If your in such heavy debt and you keep on spending, I mean who would do that? Rebbecca does. She has a major problem that I personally couldn't really relate to. But she was certainly a loveable character who I ended up appreciating during the end of the book. Moving forward, at the beginning of the book I found it sort of dragged on. There wasn't really a plot, it was just showing what sort of a problem Becky has. Once you start to get around the middle/end of the book your very captivated.<br />The plot grabs hold of you, and you can't put the book down. But the problem with the book is, that this only happens around the end of the book. The entire thing isn't realistic, or in my case relateable. Its just a bit of light fluff that you might read to cheer yourself up, or have some fun. <br />Not a serious book, but something fun. I own this book just for kicks. It wasn't laugh out loud hilarious but something you will appreciate in your head. <br />I'm not sure if I will read the sequel, because if its similiar to this one, I don't think its worth much of my time. But I would reccomend reading the first one, form your own opinion, and just have fun.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I see today paralleled to yesteryear of the late 80's, when the alternative scene was fading into obscurity, but the grunge revolution had not yet hit.  A scary and uncertain time of teased hair and make-up wearing hair bands that needed to be destroyed, and along came Nirvana.   <br />     Today I feel the same void exist in music, with a few exceptions, commercially catering to the \\"average person\\" with Menudo-like teen bands and talentless pop queens.  We need another revolution. <br />     Arcade Fire could just be one of the bands to make that revolution happen, squelching the manufactured noise and freeing us to new creativity.  I hope I don't sound too glum, I just like to believe I have a refined pallet that's starving.  `Funeral' is probably the freshest stuff I've heard in 10 years.  To put it bluntly, I was blown away.  The magic is there, period.  I've read the obvious comparisons to which Arcade Fire is compared and I love those bands, but this band has warmth and passion I happily can't seem to place.  Their sound is a rainstorm in a drought and I was entranced hearing them for the first time.
0975991477|2.0|This book is a real disappointment. The title itself promises that the reader will gain new understanding of how one's subconsious rules behavior and how to rewrite the programing. It gives a very detailed description of how cells work and how they react to enviornment which early on holds out the bright promise of understanding how to change those reactions. However, the end of the book was a cheep sell out to refer the reader to the workshops presented by the writer and his partner, to the tune of $400 each. (it seems you really need two or three of them to rewrite your programing according to the web site to which the book refers the reader).  As far as I can tell from the web site, it is just more worthless new age hype. Sorry I spent my money on this book.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Admittedly, I have not listened to all of the songs on X&Y more than once.  The reason -  the first time I listened to it, I could not get past #11 Swallowed in the Sea.  Chris' vocals are unbelievable and the melody is great.  It's also one of those songs that gets better with each listen.  I think it will join the likes of \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" as one of the greatest songs of all time.   <br /> <br />I give the CD 5 stars on Track 11 alone.
0380715430|3.0|I borrowed this book from my mother - I picked it up off of the shelf and after reading the first 3 or 4 pages I knew that I had to finish it. So, I borrowed the book and was happy with it and its light and humorous telling of the long and ocassionally tortured history of the English language.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />the mistakes and problems started to pile up. Bryson illustrates a lot of  his points by showing the reader how other languages had similar developments. Most often he uses French and German, which is appropriate considering their close ties to English. On occassion, though, he uses Spanish, which is something that I am sensitive to since I teach Spanish. Mr. Bryson's assertions about Spanish accents and pronunciation were wrong more often than right. Too bad Mr. Bryson did not have a Spanish speaker actually pronounce a few of the words for him so he could see that his points were flawed from their inception. It called into question the rest of his pronouncements.<br /><br />To make it worse, this normally breezy, fun book gets seriously bogged down about halfway through - but it does pick up rather nicely  - only to get mired down again at the very end with a seemingly endless discussion of palindromes and crossword puzzles.<br /><br />Do I recommend the book - yes with reservations. There are lots of wonderful things to be read in it - just bring along your grain of salt, and occasionally your ability to skim!
B00005JL78|4.0|This is exactly what you can expect from Spielberg. A good science fiction movie with good thrills and a very creative plot. It's about the future, and the new police of the future. This police has a system that can predict killings before they trully physically occur. Tom Cruise is part of thi police and the movie first introduces this system. But, then, when Cruise's character is the next person to be accused of doing a murder, he knows the rest of the force will try to arrest him. He then runs off trying to elude the police and tries to find out why he would do this crime by going to the location of the crime. What's interesting is the neat jetpacks by the cops and also, when the person is arrested. They don't go to jail but get put in some location where they're like in a comma, in away. Cruise's character while trying to elude the cops and trying to find out why he would kill someone, must also deal with his personal deamons, that being dealing with the kidnapping and probable death of his son. The movie is powerful with some great thrills, action scenes, and a neat look into the future. This movie is what I call VERY ORIGiNAl. A definite must see.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Audioslave's new single should have been called \\"kill yourself\\" instead of \\"be yourself\\" because that's what this record makes me want to do.<br /><br />I looked forward to this for months only to give it a few spins and be bored out of my skull.  Everything on this album is very formulaic and lacks depth.<br /><br />Buy the new White Stripes and/or Gorillaz album instead.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Wow, this movie started out good with beautiful visuals and depictions of tornados and floods and then... So, I said that the first 30 minutes were good, and then the rest of the movie was absolutely horrid. Well, the movie's about a scientist that think that the world is going to come into a new ice age. Of course, this happens, and when there are terrible floods in New York, he decides to go with 2 co workers to save his son who's there. It's absolutely freezing out and while the other 2 die, the dad played by Dennis Quaid of course survives. I mean, what the heck was Roland Emmerich thinking? Yeah, like a human would survive in such atrocious weather conditions. Sure, Dennis Quaid isn't cold at all and he just keeps on walking for like 1000000000000000 miles and saves his son. This movie is absolutely terrible and movies stupid like this are always the huge blockbusters while the best movies ever don't win close to this one's box office results. Stay far away from this terrible movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the stunning visions of the torndos and floods. But the other 70% of the movie was terrible.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park blew onto the scene with their 2001 debut album \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  With high expectations they released what would amount to a stellar album in \\"Meteora\\" (After an ultimately forgettable intermim release entitled \\"Reanimation.\\") <br /> <br />For existing fans of Linkin Park this effort is sure to please.  Following a similar formula from \\"Hybrid Theory\\", \\"Meteora\\" exhibits the unique blend of rock and rap that propelled Linkin Park into stardom.  The album includes songs that feature the vocals of both Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington, only the vocals of Chester Bennington, and the requisite DJ track that seems to be the norm these days. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Stay\\" is an excellent beginning to the album.  Like most Linkin Park songs it is short but intense.  \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", the album's first single, is a unique and well engineered song that gradually builds up to an explosive bridge.  \\"Lying From You\\" and \\"Numb\\" are the two best tracks on the album and have thus received strong airtime. <br /> <br />For buyers who are unfamiliar with the band and their music this album is as good a start as Hybrid Theory.  It features strong power chord riffs, excellent DJ work by Joe Hahn, and explores a wide vocal range from guttural roars to crooning melodies and swift rap grooves. <br /> <br />If you are interested in rock, rap, or the combo of both I would wholeheartedly recommend this album.
0783225849|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite Hitchcock movie. It's famous for the \\"shower\\" scene, but believe, that's only halfway through the movie, it gets only better from there and ends with a highly unpredictable and classic Hitchcock ending.   The story is about a woman who is given money by her boss to place in his account. But, she decides to take it and run off with it. She does so, so that she would be able to live a wonderful life with her boyfriend. She stops at a motel out of town and is the only one there. Once there she meets Norman Bates, the owner, played with perfection by Anthony Perkins. She knows that Norman's a strange man as his mother lives in a large mansion up on a hill and the woman always hears Norman argue with his mom. And then, the woman is murdered while taking a shower. You're lead to believe that it's by the mother but you never will know the truth until the very end. And then, the woman's sister and boyfriend go and investigate her strange dissapearance. Hitchcock is at his best, believe me and this old thriller is way better and delivers much more frights than all the new horror movies. This smart movie is built around Anthony Perkins and his tremendous acting skills.   Hitchcock is probably the best director of all time. He has created in the 1950s a movie that is better and that delivers more frights that any movie now.   This is his best movie of all time. It is quite frankly a perfect movie. It has no faults whatsoever. The acting is spot on, the cinematography is great, the thrills are constant and the twist is brilliant. My only regret is that I hadn't seen it before the ending had been given away.   The score though is my favorite part of the movie. To me, the score is a crucial aspect of movies. The one here is chilling. The best of all time. Right from the opening credits, you can tell that this score is fantastic. It's plain creepy and the chords at each stab in the shower scene are spot on.   The most ingenious thing about Hitchcock is that the shower scene here shows no nudity whatsoever. That is brilliant. How he somehow films it without that is extraordianry.   It's pointless to write a longer review because everyone know the genious of this movie. Just buy it already.
B000069CWE|3.0|While I am a big fan of Linkin Park's music I felt that this album was a huge disappointment.  I say that because I felt it was more of an experimental release than a true album.  The band had one major label release (2000's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" on Warner Bros. Records) prior to \\"Reanimation.\\"  Therefore, it seemed a tad audacious for the band to simply remix their entire album to sell. <br /> <br />It was claimed by the band to be a project that they had been working on for a while and that may very well be, but that doesn't hide the fact that the album simply isn't very good.  There are a few standout tracks such as the remix to \\"Pushing Me Away\\", \\"Points of Authority\\", and \\"One Step Closer\\", but overall the album is overproduced and lacks any real flow to it. <br /> <br />The only fans that may enjoy this album are hardcore fans of rap or hardcore fans of Linkin Park.  I would recommend both \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" above Reanimation especially to a newcomer to the world of Linkin Park.
B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy is the movie based on the comic book that I hadn't even ever heard about. Well anyway, if the comic's half as good as this, it will be good! This is a very good superhero movie about Hellboy. He's big, red, has a big tail and a big gun. He's bigger, badder, and stronger than the other red superhero guy, your friendly neighborhood spiderman. Well ,anyway, in this movie, he's got to fight evil and stop world domination from a bunch of nutcases. One vilain particualrily cool has some big blades that come out from his hands. Hellboy also has to fight some crazy weird looking monsters alongside an FBI agent who's trying to steal his girl.<br /><br />What makes this movie work is the great action and the hilarious humor. Ron Perlman's great as Hellboy and has some good one liners. This one didn't even look that good to me, but for a superhero movie, this one's great.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park first appeared in the mainstream circuit in 2000.  Their history as a band dates back to as far as 1996 but the current lineup of Brad Delson (Guitar), Rob Bourdon (Drums), Phoenix (Bass), Joe Hahn (DJ), Mike Shinoda (Rapping/MC), and Chester Bennington (Vocals) is relatively new. <br /> <br />While the fusion of rock and rap is not a new concept the sound of Linkin Park is undeniably unique.  Their dynamic range is incredible and is evident in back to back tracks \\"In The End\\" and \\"A Place For My Head\\", two of the best songs on the album.  The incredible vocal performance by Chester Bennington on \\"Crawling\\" earned great accolades for the band and helped to propel them into megastardom. <br /> <br />You will enjoy this cd if you are into heavier sounding rock but not necessarily heavy metal or hardcore metal.  Their sound is almost nu-metal but the riffs are decidedly versatile.  The album will appeal to fans of a wide range of vocal styles from straight screaming (\\"By Myself\\"), to a mixture of singing and screaming (\\"One Step Closer\\"), to a crooning ballad type (\\"In The End\\" and \\"Pushing Me Away\\"). <br /> <br />If you have an open mind to a variety of musical genres then this album is definitely worth a listen.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I had not actually really heard about this movie and knew just a little about the plot, but I still decided to buy it. And, wow, that was a good choice. This is the most original movie EVER!! It has lots of dark humor (absolutely hilarious moments), drama, science-fiction, and horror. So, it basically just mixes every genre possible in a blender to make a highly orignal and awesome movie that will make you think a lot.  The movie also has great acting, notably by Jake Gylenhaal as Donnie and his dad was great also. Jena Malone also does a great job as Donnie's cute and sweet girlfriend. The movie also has stars Patrick Swayze (he was hilarious and great) and Drew Barrymore. The movie is about Donnie Darko, a troubled youngster who goes to a psychiatrist. He is visited by his imaginary rabbit reptilian, human sized friend called Frank. He talks to him, telling him to do things and about what will happen in the future. One very strange but amazing moment comes when the engine of a plane lands in Donnie's room. Donnie is bothered by some bullies at school and is very open to tell everyone what's on his mind (his teacher and a public speaker). But, Frank tells him to do bad things, which I won't give away but the greatest mystery is when Frank tells Donnie when the world is going to end. The voice of Frank is powerful and absolutely brilliant, but the actor that carries the movie is Jake Gylenhaal. His emotions, expressions, movemets, and powerful sentences are brilliant. Everything in this movie is brilliant and the ending still has me confused and shocked. That's why this is like Memento a movie that you need to rewatch. This movie is so original that you just have to be amazed and absolutely love it. This one will make you think and think over and over. And lastly, another compelling aspect of this movie is the awesome 80s pop music. It's fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Believe me, this one's awesome and a must see.
B000021Y77|2.0|It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.    Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.    The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.    I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it.
6304711891|4.0|Of course, this movie is way over the top and unrealistic but it's still a blast. Sean Connery plays the only person that ever escaped from Alcatraz, Nicolas Cage is a biochemist, and they team up to fight Ed Harris's character and his group of terrorists. They hold up Alcatraz and threathen to execute hostages and threathen to release a deadly chemical on San Fransisco. Sean Connery's great as is Cage and the movie has lots of nonstop action, good humor, and some really awesome scenes you'll love. Even though you know before watching it that Connery and Cage will save the world, it still is a blast and a good watch.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm the kind of person who is very cynical about television shows. In fact I have not watched any shows regularly for many years, which is why I had never heard of Firefly until a friend loaned it to me a few days ago. <br /> <br />So I find it a little ironic that I was introduced to this truly wonderful show only to discover that it was cancelled after a few months. <br /> <br />Looking back, my all time favorite show would have to be Star Trek:The Next Generation. Firefly is easily as good. I won't say it's better because they are completely different, but it's on the same level in terms of quality. <br /> <br />The cast and characters are perfect. The dialogue is smart and funny. The stories are fun and exciting. I just wish there was more of it. Only 14 episodes? What a cruel joke, but it's better than nothing. <br /> <br />If you are thinking about picking up this series, I recommend that you do it now before the movie comes out in Sept 2005 so that you can be sure to appreciate all the nuances. But don't make plans for a couple days because you won't be able to resist watching all the episodes one after another. I have my own copy coming in the mail, and when it gets here I'll do it all over again.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Well, after seeing the absolutely brilliant and just plain awesome Kill Bill Vol. 1, I had my hopes very high for this one. I couldn't wait for it. But, when I left the theater, I was actually dissapointed. This one isn't at all like its predecessor. While the first one had MANY absolutely awesome fighting scenes and had great humor and a great story, this didn't like that one. First off, this one was way too long, and it went too much into detail in the past and training of the Bride. That's where it kind of lost me. Sure, the scene where she fights the Nurse is great, but that's really all. I have to admit, I liked some of the story andd it was a solid movie but was just way too slow moving. Where's the awesome fight scenes? Where's the great humor? I really don't know. and then the fight against Bill just didn't deliver. It was a really average and just weird fight that wasn't like what I had expected. this was a letdown. But, it still deserves 3 and 1/2 stars for one awesome fighting, some very neat moments, and some interesting parts. Also, watch the only deleted scene. It's a really good fight where Bill kcks a**! If you liked the first one, you should rent this but probably not buy it unless you're just a plain die hard fan. This movie is above average but dissapointing and unlike the wiked # 1.
B0007TKH66|3.0|I am always careful when I see 5 stars or 1... This show was certainly better than Andromeda or Firefly, but it was no Babylon 5 or Farscape... Of all Trek series, it was the worst... In a way, it's very similar to Voyager, what's the difference between being stranded far from home (Voyager) and being the only Warp 5 ship being sent on an exploration mission (and thus being alone, again?)...<br />Was it good sci-fi? Sure. Star Trek has never looked better. But \\"Star Trek\\", this series isn't. Roddenberry would certainly hate that series... The characters are badly developed and rather dull... They are overgrown teenagers in the way they behave... Most don't even look intelligent while we know StarFleet personnel are often PH.D. in series that take place in the future... They are never truly amazed or in awe when they are seeing things no Human ever saw before... Spock was fascinated, Picard was still curious, and so was Sisko, but Archer and his crew don't seem to be excited by what they do... No passion... <br />The Vulcans do not behave as they should... In previous Trek series we learn that Vulcans are pacifistic and embraced logic thousands of years ago, while in Enterprise, Vulcan is a military power controlled by often emotional and paranoid people... Why this blatant transgression? <br />The dialogues are badly written and the storylines lack imagination. Can that be blamed on the fact that Star Trek has been on TV for 20 years without a break? Perhaps, but perhaps not... Star Trek became an industry that wanted to play it safe and adapt to the viewers' expectations... And the viewers, young males mostly, wanted fist fights, space combat and sexy curves... That's what they got... But that's not what Star Trek is about...<br />Even before the series first aired, I did not expect it would last very long or be very good. It was a mistake to create a prequel to Star Trek. I feared the creators would paint themselves into a corner, and they did... Spock was supposed to be the first Vulcan in StarFleet, but T'Pol will be... The first ship called Enterprise in StarFleet was to be NCC-1701, Kirk's ship, but now it's Archer's NX-01... The Ferengui will have their first look at Humans when facing Picard in TNG, but NX-01 will be boarded by Ferenguis... The temporal Cold War will introduce species we'll never see again, like the Suliban, and later on the Xindi... This Trek series is at odds will previous series... Some will say, \\"hey, that's just TV, relax, it's a show\\"... Bottom line: you want good sci-fi, visually impressive, this is for you, but if you feel the best Star Trek series were TNG or DS9, then know that Enterprise is even less Trek than Voyager was... No wonder the series got cancelled...
B00081912E|3.0|There was some buzz around the time of THE MASK'S release in 1994 that Jim Carrey had finally found a cinematic vehicle worthy of his talents.  Well, yes and no.  Carrey, like his predecessor in manic comedy, Robin Williams, was too big a talent for the small screen, but, in both their cases, the question always lingered: was their talent big enough for the big screen?  Actually, that's too glib a question.  The talent was obviously there.  It really was a matter of finding the right vehicle to express it. After ACE VENTURA, THE MASK couldn't help but appear to be a step up.    But, of course, Carrey's taken several steps since then and has gotten himself real screen cred with more recent critical successes like THE TRUMAN SHOW and last year's ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  More than ten years on, howver, it looks likely that the film will be better remembered as a landmark in computer generated action than as a comic vehicle for its star.    You have to give Carrey his props, however, he is one of the few comic actors who can hold his own against all that CGA.  You could almost say that the animation is, in fact, an extension of his own wiry physicality.  If not quite seamless, it comes pretty close.  Carrey was probably the kind of kid who did flawless imitations of cartoon characters.  That he should become one in this movie seems fitting.    As a live-action cartoon, THE MASK is right up there with ROGER RABBIT.  (And just who is hotter anyway? Cameron or Jessica?).  Its quotes of old Tex Avery cartoons (as well as others) should tickle pop culture aficianados everywhere.  Heck, even the dog named Milo is a cartoon quote.  It's all very clever, and you can almost forgive the movie for not using its human actors nearly as well.  (Peter Riegert, a fine actor, has virtually nothing to do here, while Amy Yasbeck is asked to do almost too much in her brief screentime.)    For what it is, THE MASK works pretty well.  It's silly fun, and something of a landmark in CGA.  Of course, there are landmarks and there are landmarks.  In terms of plot or character development, it offers little new.  The nerdy good guy tapping into the hero within is as hackneyed a plot device as you'll ever get. Maybe if the movie had stuck more to its darker graphic novel origins, something a little bolder might have come of it.  But if it's not avant-garde, it's still pretty entertaining.  Still all this advanced technology rendering service to a hoary plotline makes for something of a missed opportunity.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Now that artists Pink Floyd are touring again, maybe Coldplay could go with them.  How cool would that be!!!!!!  As for this CD, I really like the front design and the mellow tunes.  I used to not like this band, but I can see now that actress Sheena Easton has really helped Chris Martin's singing career.  It's good they got married.  I predict he will go far...probably even make a solo record soon!!  <br /> <br />Hey, if you guys know when Floyd is coming to Austin, by all means post it on my reviews message board.  And also, does anyone know when Roth is reuniting with his boys in Halen?  I can't wait for that one...could be bigger than the Beatles. <br /> <br />Get this X & Y CD record at all costs...it jams!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
0385512058|4.0|For those of us who are not natural networkers, have introvert tendencies, or are not sure to how to manage a large number of relationships, Never Eat Alone provides insight into the mind of a person who has conquered many of these challenges. Ferrazzi shows the benefits of maintaining connections with the people we interact with in life and offers some guidelines for how to maintain these relationships in a mutually beneficial manner.<br /><br />I heartily disagree with those who suggest that this is a guide in how to use people for your own ends.  In fact, Ferazzi makes a convincing case that we should not do that and is disdainful of people are pure networkers. He believes that relationships are best when both people contribute something, and that giving of yourself to others is the best way to get something back. As far as Ferazzi being a name-dropper, I found that it added some reality to his ancedotes. It is a little inspirational that he has been able to find ways to maintain useful connections with very busy people.<br /><br />It is a fairly well-written and entertaining book, readable on a  cross country flight. I don't think I would ever want to be a person that is primarily valued through my connections to others, but it does make me want to reach out to the people that I do know and ensure that we continue to benefit from each other.  The worst thing you can do is only reach out to others when you need them.  If you follow Ferazzi's advice, they will be the ones reaching out to help you.
B00063MBU8|4.0|I loved this second album from Simple Plan.  I definitely think that the band is maturing, and that just makes me like them more. <br /> <br />I hate when a band puts out a second album that is just a big disappointment, but this wasn't that. <br /> <br />My favorite song is Untitled which is about someone who drives drunk and gets into an accident and ends up killing the other driver.  I didn't know what it was about at first, but it really touched me.  If you like them, you should check out the video on their website. <br /> <br />Other songs that I liked on this cd were Jump, Shut Up!, Perfect World, Promise, Welcome to My Life, and Me Against the World. <br /> <br />Perfect World seems to have multiple meanings and that made me like it more. <br /> <br />Me Against the World and Welcome to My Life both talk about struggles and I could identify with them. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are just fun. <br /> <br />Thanks for a great album Simple Plan.
B000002UB3|5.0|If Sgt Pepper is the most influentual album ever made, then Abbey Road might as well have the title of the greatest. This album represents perfection, and it is timeless. From the catchy blues/rock of \\"Come Together\\" to the beautiful line that closes out the album on \\"The End\\", \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\\" Abbey Road is The Beatles' crowning achievement, and the shining moment of Paul and George (Lennon doesn't quite do his best here, but he's still good nonetheless, and Ringo does provide the pretty \\"Octopus' Garden\\"), which is evident from the beautiful pop suite that finishes the album, or songs like \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". This is absolutely essential, and obviously a predecessor to later, similarly great albums like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Buy it now.
B00003CXA3|5.0|This fast paced classic was the vehicle for Hackmans prodigious talent and a lot more besides.It tells the story of two Detectives who pick up the scent of a major drug bust. loosely based on an actual case the script traces the unrelenting efforts of these Detectives played by Hackman (Popeye Doyle)and scheider (Cloudy Russo)to identify the main players behind one of the biggest drug importations up to that time.This movie unlike the later sequel was reasonably true to the general facts of the actual case although it chooses to ignore the fact that the drugs were in fact stolen after they had been seized, which was most probably an inside job as they were stolen from the custody of the Police. It is a mystery why this aspect did not form the storyline of the sequel when in fact the script writers chose a completely fictional theme for the sequel, but then I guess what really went down did not lend itself to an exciting storyline especially when the case was never completely solved.The movie itself is carried by the stellar performances of Hackman and Sheider and is further enhanced by a great location and a better than average supporting cast. The part of Alain Charnier or Frog One was perfectly cast with the very fine actor Fernando Rey producing a stand out performance in both movies. It would not do the movie justice if it were merely remembered for the brilliant car chase although car chase buffs would no doubt disagree. That the movie won as many oscars that year is testimony to its greatness. Hackman showed in spades in this landmark performance that he was Hollywood top shelf and went on to excell in many more although none better than this in my opinion. This was Hackmans defining role as was Patton with respect to George C Scott. A very watchable film somewhat drawn out in parts but never boring. A true classic in many ways.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Buble makes new songs sound old and old songs brand new. On his self-titled debut, he splashed some big band swagger on Queen's \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" and Van Morrison's \\"Moondance\\" and managed to both backdate AND update the songs for a new and eager audience, selling some three million CDs in the process. With his sophomore release,  Buble strays only far enough from the formula to make it interesting. There are plenty of classics for Grandma: from \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" to \\"You Don't Know Me.\\" There are baby boomer favorites reinvented swing style like \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" And then there are the surprises: Buble's rip-roaring take on Nina Simone's \\"Feeling Good,\\" a southern rock/bluesy spin through \\"How Sweet It is\\" complete with scorching harmonica, a lush bossa nova duet with Nelly Furtado on \\"Quando Quando Quando\\" and - best of all - the tender new non-big-band ballad \\"Home\\" which adds yet another layer of commercial viability to Buble's belt. Buble certainly isn't the first to mine for gold in the standards, but unlike Rod Stewart who turned to yesteryear out of desperation after his rock career floundered, Buble appears genuinely enamored with nostalgia. And, thanks to his boy-next-door looks and gifted baritone voice, he may be the best thing to happen to the standards since Tony Bennett performed on MTV Unplugged.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|In Your Honor is the latest album from Foo Fighters, and it's one of the finest that Foo Fighters have made in their 10 years of rocking the world.  Both discs are absolutely wonderful! The first disc rocks so hard and the second is mellow and calming.  The lyrics are beautiful and inspriational, anyone could relate to these 20 songs.  This album shows how good the foo's really are.  I haven't stopped listening to it since i bought it the first day it came out.  In Your Honor is one of the best albums of the year! I love it.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|It's kind of spooky the way this woman channels Billie Holiday.  The jury is divided: some argue that if you want to hear Billie Holiday, just put on some Billie Holiday. But we hold to the belief that good music is good music, and you can never have enough.  Born in Georgia, raised in New York and Paris, Peyroux is this year's Norah Jones (she even penned a song with Norah collaborator Jesse \\"Don't Know Why\\" Harris). But this CD has a little more whiskey in it than Norah's records. It has the sweet, sweet stink of juke joints and barbecue and old `78s (without the scratches). Songs range from Holiday standards like \\"No More\\" and \\"I'll Look Around\\" to Josephine Baker's \\"Jai Deux Amours.\\" But Peyroux truly shines on contemporary covers of Leonard Cohen, Elliot Smith and especially Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\\"
B00004XQ83|5.0|The music here, like the film it provides the soundtrack for, is presumably intended to take us back to the thirties. Several songs from that era are featured along with traditional material that would have been popular then. Recorded mainly with state-of-the-art technology (except for some old recordings that are included and re-mastered), the sound quality is far superior to anything available in the thirties. Several different types of music can be found here - blues, gospel, country and folk - mainly performed by contemporary artists with a deep respect for tradition. I'll just pick out some of them although there are many excellent songs here.<br /><br />Even Alison Krauss sticks firmly with tradition here - she often brings contemporary influences into her music these days but not here. Alison can be heard here on Down to the river to pray (as a solo singer), I'll fly away (providing harmony vocals for lead singer Gillian Welch) and Didn't leave nobody but the baby (joining Gillian and Emmylou in three-part harmony).<br /><br />The inclusion of two Carter Stanley songs on a soundtrack such as this is predictable but welcome, with the Whites performing a superb version of the oft-recorded Keep on the sunny side, while the Peasall children (Hannah singing lead with Sarah and Leah providing harmony vocals) are in great form on In the highways. Children's recordings rarely impress me but this track does.<br /><br />One song here that surprised me (though perhaps it shouldn't have) is Big rock candy mountain. It can be found on plenty of albums of children's songs, when it is invariably presented as an up-tempo song that children can (if they wish) sing along to. Here we get the original 1928 recording by Harry McLintock, who sings it at a more measured, reflective pace, showing that there is more to this song than I originally thought. I still prefer it as an up-tempo song generally but I'm glad I heard this version. I wonder what the Peasall sisters would have done with this song.<br /><br />The Coen brothers clearly hoped that this soundtrack would provide a resurgence of interest in traditional music. While this soundtrack was a big commercial success, it seems that the majority of people who bought it (and continue to buy it) regard it as something of a novelty. Nashville record labels signed some traditional singers (Elizabeth Cook, though not featured here, is one that comes to mind) but they didn't get enough airplay on American country radio, so such artists were dropped and Nashville returned to its contemporary format. I'm sure that this soundtrack helped to win some new fans for traditional music, but not as many as the Coen brothers would like.ave done with this song. <br /> <br />The Coen brothers clearly hoped that this soundtrack would provide a resurgence of interest in traditional music.

B000001EAQ|5.0|POP is a gifted, beautiful album; its chilling music and sneering soundscapes are the perfect vehicles for its cryptic, elliptical lyrics. Its narrative is dense and convoluted, but the repeated listens it takes to get into the album are worth it.  <br /> <br />The music itself is equally inspired, as the band employs tricky time signatures and trademark sonic textures that range from the electronic crackle and haunting piano of Gone to the howling post-electronica of Mofo to Please's gorgeous coda. Wake Up Dead Man has an operatic despair that is terrifying to behold, and If God Will Send His Angels was the first song released in years with a melancholy melody sublime enough to push up tears behind my eyes.  <br /> <br />All this would be pretentious in the hands of a lesser band, but is simply assured beauty here. If this sounds like art rock on the scale of King Crimson or the Moody Blues, it is; however, U2's staggering talent and emotional commitment make POP less a lame intellectual exercise than a moving take on existentialism in the post-modern world. It also rocks like a son of a bitch when it needs to.  <br /> <br />Please is still their last ever great song: very dramatic, extremely beautiful, great sonority and without being the prototype of the traditional architecture of a track, it is worth the price of the album alone.  <br /> <br />U2 were (yes, sadly WERE) the one of the rare artists who not only had a unique vision, but the skill to pull it off. POP is wise enough to address the heart as well as the mind, and is their last finest work to date. Easily one of the best albums of the 90's , and likely their last important in terms of creativity.  <br /> <br />Honestly, it is probably the strangest, most diverse U2 album they've ever made, and I immediately fell in love with it.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this album to anyone who is really, really sick of mainstream corporate U2 2000 \\"rock\\"  sounds the same all  <br />the time. <br /> <br />U2 1980-1997.
B000002UB6|5.0|Let It Be was a great album to be The Beatles' last. The songs somewhat show that it is the end. My favorite song is \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". The music touches your heart and sends you a message. This is one of their best works. I, like most people, wish that The Beatles never broke up. Their music is fantastic and this album shows it.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Everybody has to admit that Audioslave really cut edge by releasing their debut album in 2002. There are several memorable songs on that album, ranging from the powerful rocker \\"Show me how to live\\" to softer pieces like \\"Like a Stone\\". But naysayers argue that the release of \\"Out of exile\\" is far from perfect and pales to comparison. I personally disagree with that. I think many reviewers who have bashed this album so far need to get into the mood of that album. <br />The four-piece group showcases their undeniable talent in songwriting and penning lyrics with strong imagery (lyrics here are credited to the singer, who departed from his earlier band Soundgarden). Tom Morello seems to be stepping on firm ground now, because he became even more innovative on the guitar. Several songs stand out here, such as the opening and the title tracks. \\"The Worm\\", for instance, can still impress the most demanding listener because of its awesome instrumental lines.  <br />\\"Out of exile\\" (the album) takes some listens, but it shortly after grows on you nicely. The last few tracks put the album into a mellower mood, but it sets a very intimate and emotional atmosphere.  <br />All in all, it's an outstanding release by this groundbreaking band, which didn't let me down at all. Audioslave has proven that they can sound different on every album, escaping from the risk of being considered formulaic.  <br />It's really worth the purchase.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The only draw back though is the fact its like the Velvet Revolver cd with that licensing thing. But other than that, it kicks butt. I like all the songs on this album and it seems to be a lot deeper lyrically than the rest, well one by one was kinda deep too. I just think its the fact that they are growing stronger and better as a band and writting better stuff that doesnt sound the same as their other songs. Most bands do that and it gets irritating after a while. This is a must have for any Foo, or Nirvana fan. I would give it 10 stars, but it only goes to five. So it is five for disc one and five for disc two. That totals ten!
B00005JNJT|1.0|There seem to be two types of reviews/reviewers:  those who take \\"Batman Begins\\" seriously and those who don't.   What \\"BB\\" is is an attempt to rejuvenate sagging summer profits by tapping into both safer and less safe, but promising talents.  Bale was an unorthodox choice;  Caine, Neeson, Oldman were safe bets.  Nolan adventurous, but gifted, just like Burton.  Nice balance all around.  The \\"franchise\\" is a venerable one;  its possibilities for cinematic renewal are endless:  \\"Batman\\" can be whatever Hollywood wants him to be at any time.  IN \\"BB,\\" he was a ninja.  He fought near-terrorists this time;  see him fight real terrorists next time.  And, so far, it's worked real well.   <br /> <br />What Hollywood needs/needed real bad - even as the carp-like publicity thrashings about of Cruise and Holmes (including Cruise's latest \\"sparring\\" with Lauer over anti-depressants show [what a shill!] - is making *you* pay attention to movies, go to them *and so pay a lot of money to see them.*  (Don't you think that the so-called \\"romance\\" of Pitt and Jolie affected sales of \\"Mr and Mrs Smith\\" tickets?  It's a dreadful movie. When have we ever seen so much of Cruise \\"acting\\" in this way all before the opening of \\"War of the Worlds.\\"  [Sure, \\"stars\\" travel to promote, but Cruise seems to be off his rocker.  What's that crazy scamp gonna do next?]   This is a carefully orchestrated, very clever publicity campaign to focus attention.  Stakes are very high.)  Look beneath the surface, children:  Hollywood, like spyware, knows you very well and wants what you have - your money.
B00080ZG10|3.0|While this movie is well produced and interesting it leaves out such crucially important information as to make it valueless in understanding Howard Hughes. Simply put, the movie completely ignores the drug/psychiatric connection to Hughes' eventual collapse. Always an eccentric Hughes became a morphine addict after his near fatal crash. This led to a string of psychiatric treatments that simply did what they do best.... drugged the poor man into dementia.  <br /> <br />Why did Scorsese leave this out? He tries to get the viewer to believe that Hughes descent into madness just \\"happened\\". Nothing could be further from the truth. How sad.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Seriously, this was the only album i was listening to last week. Driving to work, at work, on the way home from work...minimum 3 times a day. The first 8 tracks are just pleasure to my eardrums. \\"White Shadows\\" is probably my favorite of those, but it's hard to pick and choose, they're all so fantastic. And \\"Kingdom Come\\" is a happy additional, another wonderful song that was originally written for Johnny Cash. Get this record now if you don't have it already.
B00078807U|5.0|These are two of the best films that have been released in the last couple of years period.  Buy them! You can't beat the deal and you will not be disapointed.

0767827716|4.0|Oh man is this red plymouth a beautiful car, if it was not haunted from something from the beyond I would want it, so I can see why arnie wants it also.  The only thing is I can't really see why its rated R.  The only blood is in the end when cunningham through the windshield and minimal violence.  There is quite a bit of cussing but still not as much as what we see now.  The movie starts out reel good though, from the man's hand you gets the hood shut on it to the man the gets a cigar ash on the seat and dies.  Everyone should know not to mess with this car.  I really like the part where the car is on fire and still chases down the thug that destroyed her early, then the next scene where she is back in the garage with the cops there and the erie music is playing up to the seeing of the car and there is not a spot on her.  Well without talking about the whole movie, I would just say it is worth watching.  Also the blue dodge charger in the movie is awesome looking to, not as nice as christine though but not many are.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|This will be the last copy protected CD I will ever buy.  After paying for this CD I put it in the computer, went through the process of acquiring licenses, and ripped them to the PC to find that they are only in .wma format.  The Mediamax support site says that currently they won't play in iTunes or iPods, and to email Apple's support site to motivate them to fix this problem.  This is not Apple's problem - if the most popular MP3 player in the world won't play these tracks, that's MediaMax's problem.  So I found a bittorrent of the whole album and then downloaded the whole thing for free.  So, the irony is anti-piracy software drove me to piracy, which is just what I will do the next time I see a copy-protected sticker on a CD.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie.  Yes, it does not only contain the nice, polished side of life.  The darkness is represented (please remember it was made during World War II).  I have a deep passion for classical music, and I have enjoyed many passages of the Stokowsky interpretation - he was a keen conductor of his days.  I have seen this movie since I was a child, and just bought the DVD in 2005.  The movie *does* stand as a brilliant piece, despite it's been made 65 years ago.  The movie ends up in a hope for mankind in the Ave Maria - a prayer for compassion.  Where would we be in a world with no hope, no faith in the good in mankind?  The mythologic material is, at its best, a very competent and original visual interpretation of the music.  See this movie as a visual interpretation of some beautiful music interpreted in a \\"romantic\\" period of the 20th century.  Please allow yourself to be seducted into the visual part of the music (don't listen to the music as \\"music for the movie\\" - this one is the other way around - instead see the movie as \\"pictures for the music\\").  I wholehearted recommend it.
B000059MEK|5.0|After the huge excitement and then equal disappointment I went through with the release of Human After All, I find myself falling in love all over again with the duo's classic records. Discovery is easily one of my favorite cds from the last decade. The blend of house, vocoders, and spot-on production makes this on of the funnest dance records in my collection. <br /> <br />It opens up with one of the catchiest beats I've ever heard... \\"One More Time\\" is a VERY appropriate title, as it's hard to listen to it only once in a sitting. \\"Aerodynamic\\" keeps the dance floor moving, and \\"Digital Love\\" is an electro-pop masterpeice. \\"Harder, Better\\" is one of my favorites; so many memories of packed parties grooving to that tune. And the next track, \\"Crescendolls\\", is one giant house freakout. Other favorites include \\"Superheroes\\" (so cool) and \\"Face to Face\\" (tied for my favorite Daft Punk track with \\"Indo Silver Club\\" from Homework). <br /> <br />This album comes out at just about every party we throw; it's just one classic tune after another. With this record and Homework, Daft Punk have produced some of the funnest dance tracks in the world... and while their new album has a certain charm, it's got nothing on records like Discovery.

B000002J2B|4.0|Like many reviewers, I also feel that this was Genesis (post Gabriel) at their height. Still creating wonderful melodic pieces with the mythical quality they were known for. That being said, there is the hint of the commercial shift to come with Your Own Special Way. Still not as cheesy as Follow You Follow Me but not quite in the same realm as the rest of the album. Blood On The Rooftops, Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers and In That Quiet Earth are just beautifully crafted songs the likes of which slowly disappeared from the Genesis albums to follow.
B000002H6C|2.0|I am a metallica fan,but to a sertain point.To me this is a bunch of loud noise.To me it all sounds the same exept for afew tracks.I dont really no what to say exept for a bunch of loud noise that sounds the same.Anyways,i do like metallica,but not there thrash.I find i can never listen to a full album by them unless its s&m live.Heres the songs <br /> <br /> Blackend-starts off with a cool,tiny solo,then gets loud.I do like the chorus, and i can stand the verse,so this song is ok.7.5/10 <br /> <br />...And justice for all-like the intro,and the guitar is pretty cool throughout the song.It has a really cool chorus and for once i like the drums.pretty cool.The second best song on the cd.8.5/10 <br /> <br /> eye of the beholder-ive only listend to this song fully once, thats because i strapped myself down and nearly killed my self listening to this.4/10 <br /> <br /> one-yes!finally a song that i can say i really like.this is the reason i bought this cd.I love the guitar solos.I usually dont care what they say in a song,but you can really picture this poor cripled guy.Great lyrics.I dont like the part where it gets right heavy,but it soon stops then goes into a great solo.10/10 <br /> <br /> the shortest straw-hate it .way to grungy. 2/10 <br /> <br /> harvister of sorrow-dont care for the instruments in it,but the singing isnt bad, but i really like the lyrics.great chorus,but overall its just ok. 8/10 <br /> <br /> The frayed ends of sanity-sounds like a cave man song from the people singing at the begining,then gets really heavy.never lisend to it completly,never will.2/10 <br /> <br /> to live is to die- a nice instramental.Not great but good-8/10 <br /> <br /> dyers eve-usually dont make it this far into the cd, because i usually have it out way before this.So i had to pop it in to review it just like frayed end of sanity, shortest straw,eye of the beholder.I give it 0/10. <br /> <br />  <br />anyways, i dont see how anyone can sit down and not get angry and gokill someone.This cd was almost $30, big waste.anyways, if you whant metallica, get the black album and s$m live.
1563894696|5.0|\\"Batman:  The Long Halloween\\" is a must-have for any fan of the Dark Knight.  This is a graphic novel in the truest sense.   <br />It is graphic in the sense that the art uses contrast and darkness masterfully to create an atmosphere that is worthy of Gotham City.  The shadows seem to hide potent secrets.  It is a novel in that the author uses all the great tools: characterization, irony, ambiguity (when appropriate), and a conflict to serve as a backdrop for the ongoing story.  The moral dilemmas that face the characters (how far should one go to stop crime?), the eagerness of certain characters to please their father figures, are all well written aspects of this story. <br /> <br />    The story begins with an alliance of Jim Gordon, Batman, and Harvey Dent.  This story takes place before the introduction of Two-Face into the storyline.  All three agree to take down a crime boss, Falcone.  Gordon makes it clear that nothing illegal is to take place.   <br /> <br />    Along the way, however, a mysterious killer known only as \\"Holiday\\" begins to kill members of organized crime and the Batman begins to doubt the alliance and working with others in general.  The city erupts into a frenzy of fear and suspicion.  Why, though, are only members of organized crime dying? <br /> <br />    The story follows the lives of three men:  Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon, and Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Each character is written in a dynamic manner, showing both strength of character and hidden flaws. Dent slowly transitions to his role as Two-face, the most unpredictable (including the Joker) Batman foe of all, sometimes committing crime and sometimes delivering justice.  He is willing, however, to cross the line that separates crime and law to pursue justice.  One of the main themes of the novel is the transition from Harvey Dent to Two-face.  It is extremely well done.   <br /> <br />     Jim Gordon is also shown as a family man whose sense of honor is unwaivering.  I really like the way that Gordon spearheads this operation/alliance, and also believe that \\"The Long Halloween\\" develops the character of Gordon the best of any graphic novel so far.   <br /> <br />     Batman is relegated to duty as Detective.  This is a detective novel, in which the protagonist is attempting to capture a murderer.  He will follow leads to this strange Holiday killer and bring him in.  That there is a good mystery in a Batman novel is a necessity that I think some of us Detective fans take forgranted.   <br /> <br />    The book is just simply wonderful.  It is a murder mystery, a coming of age, and personal war all in one chronicle.  At the risk of sounding cliche, it has something for everyone who is a Batman fan.  It may be the best work of Batman fiction ever to grace the bookstore.
B00001OH7V|5.0|This album certainly does take a bit of getting used to; the songs here sound unusual and rather unconventional but still brilliant thanks to Bowie.  <br />Blackout has a great, pounding intro with thumping, upbeat pianos and Joe the Lion is the most raw and rough sounding track. Bowie's vocals are their best in Heroes and Sons of the Silent Age. Even the instrumentals add to the eerie ambience of the album, the best being V2 Schneider, a great combination of strange sax playing with electronic sounds. The Secret Life... adds a much needed funky ending to the album. <br />Before buying Heroes, I was quite cynical about listening to instrumentals and electronic sounds. However it has convinced me otherwise and it seems more accessible than Low.
1401200605|4.0|The basic premise of the book is that some villain is pulling strings all over Gotham City.  Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and other villains are being manipulated by an even greater threat.  Is it the man in bandages that watches the conflagration from a safe distance and a sadistic smile?  Or is it even more complex than that?          It is as though all the characters in the Batman universe are players on a giant chess board and one mastermind is manipulating them all.  Worse yet, this manipulator appears to know that Bruce Wayne is Batman.          This is the beginning of the mystery, and I would encourage you to buy both volumes of \\"Hush\\" because the second volume is thicker than the first and contains the climax and resolution that the events set forth in vol. 1 demand.  Just so you'll know, if you aren't a big Catwoman fan, let me warn you up front that she is a big player in this storyline.          The plot to these two volumes is rich and are worthy of the World's Greatest Detective. Villains seem to attack the Batman in new ways, shirking their once seemingly indomitable addiction to gimmicks.  A plot beyond the scope of even Batman threatens to consume him.  The plot is unpredictable because you are not sure which direction Batman will be led by this mysterious \\"Pied Piper.\\"  The art also is some of the best I've ever seen, with the backgrounds and characters springing to life.
B000000OQF|5.0|I HATE TO SAY THIS ABOUT ALL THE OTHER GOOD BANDS OUT THERE; GOOD LUCK ON TRYING TO MAKE A SINGLE ALBUM THAT MATCHES OR BEATS THE MUSIC ON APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION.  I WISH THAT PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE REAL BAND THAT GN'R ONCE WAS.  ALTHOUGH EGO AND TURMOIL BROKE THEM UP IN THE MID-'90'S, THE BAND'S SOUND STILL SELLS MORE ALBUMS EVERY WEEK THAN ANY OTHER ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD TODAY.  THE ILLUSIONS AND SPAGHETTI CAME OUT AFTER APPETITE AND LIES, AND THAT SOUND TOTALLY CHANGED THE \\"ROCK BAND\\" INTO \\"MUSICIANS\\".  NIRVANA, PEARL JAM, AND NEW ROCK SOUNDS LIKE SLIPKNOT, LINKIN PARK, AND PROBABLY ANY OTHER ROCKERS OUT THERE HAVE HAD THIS ALBUM AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER.  TO THIS DAY, AND FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I WILL ALWAYS OWN  THIS ALBUM AND CONSIDER IT THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME.
B000687M48|4.0|Evanescence has done it again! Great job! Although I tend to like the studio versions better than the live songs... (The sound is better quality to me)... Still awesome. The song \\"Missing\\" is not live on this album and that's fine with me but even with the live songs, it still sounds great. The bonus DVD is great as well. I watch it all the time. The music videos are perfect for the songs. So far Evanescence has failed to disappoint me! I'm still a fan.
B000002KXV|5.0|Donald Fagen's 1982 offering is a detached yet heartfelt, slick, concise, sonically clean, expertly executed, sophisticate jazz pop affair.  Possibly the most accomplished collection of this musical song style ever assembled. <br /> <br />A memorable, classy masterpiece of cool -  dripping with irony and subtlety.   Pure focused genius.  How could you not have this in your cd collection? Please...
B000267JQK|4.0|I personally am I big Seether fan. I like his sound even though I do feel that he sometimes tries a little too hard to be like Kurt Cobain. Still good though. I love the version of \\"Broken\\" featuring Amy Lee of Evanescence, since I am also a huge fan of Evanescence as well. I think their voices compliment each other in a great way. The rest of the tracks on this CD are great as well and I'll have this CD in my collection for a very long time.
5550155184|3.0|I bought The Da Vinci Code on the basis that it was a bestseller and everyone had been raving about it. Unfortunately it was like hearing about a new movie coming out that is supposed to be the best movie ever (according to reviews and friends who have seen it) but when you see it yourself you wonder what the big deal was. AND if you hadn't got caught up in the hype you actually would have enjoyed it more with a lower level of expectation. Don't get me wrong, The Da Vinci Code is a good book, but I had my expectations raised and was left a little wanting.<br /><br />Dan Brown is either a very lucky author or part genius. And it's not because of the secrets he supposedly reveals, which all in all are just plausible fiction.  More so it's because he has taken a topic which people already have a passing interest in and has thrown in some \\"twists\\" that are believable enough to be taken by some as gospel.  What we have in The Da Vinci Code is a book that makes for an interesting enough read which has sprinklings of things that you never knew and can't wait to tell your friends.  Whether it be fact or fiction... Unfortunately the subject matter and associated media attention is what has made this book a bestseller, not because it is a literary masterpiece.<br /><br />Dan Brown's writing style is fast paced with the book being written on a very short timeline. This does leave you a little lost sometimes on how is what where, but it can make for an exciting read with the constant tempo.<br /><br />He is very descriptive and he writes very well. The scenes he paints with his words are exactly like the real life locations. I guarantee you after reading The Da Vinci Code if you see a TV special of any sort based on the book you WILL recognise the locations and that is pretty cool.<br /><br />There is one thing that I didn't particularly like with Brown's writing style which is his constant flashbacks for the little anecdotes. The lead sees a painting in The Louvre and remembers years ago giving a seminar on the secret aspects behind the artwork. Unfortunately it doesn't do anything for the story and more seems like the author is trying to impress with his knowledge of the subject matter.<br /><br />Don't read The Da Vinci Code thinking you are about to learn a number of mystical and religious secrets, just read it to have fun.the secret aspects behind the artwork.

B000088E77|4.0|One of the very first songs that caught my ear as a child was \\"Down Under\\", and now it sounds even better. I also really like \\"Cargo\\", but there's no doubt this is the album to own. I guess it's really nothing more than great pop/rock, but man they did it well. \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" was the other major hit, but almost everything else is as good. I also love \\"Underground\\", \\"Helpless Automation\\", \\"Be Good Johnny\\", and the excellent \\"Down By The Sea\\". The bonus tracks are all decent, but it's the original ten that make this a must for the early 80's fan. This reissue will go great with your \\"Sports\\" and \\"She's So Unusual\\" albums.
B000667GFK|3.0|Very pleasant, and a nice change for Luis Miguel, after covering ENOUGH beautiful 40s 50s and 60s boleros, or singing newly written mediocre ballads that have gotten really old and sound the same after a while.
B000021XR5|4.0|Personally, I didn't care much for the last album, and I like this one alot more. I think with \\"Tiny Music...\\" they got the arty stuff out of their system, and decided that on \\"4\\" it was time to rock again. No grunge here either, just rock, minus the few soft spots. \\"Down\\" was the first single and opener, and sets the pace for the majority of the album. \\"Sour Girl\\" was another hit, and could have been a leftover from the third album. Two others I like are \\"I Got You\\", which is a real finger-snapper, and \\"Atlanta\\", which is the best Doors song the Doors never wrote. This doesn't really touch the first two albums, but it's a solid disc, and what else could you ask 4?
B000099T2L|3.0|As much as I don't like her persona, I have to admit that she can truly sing.  Having a gifted voice and having released this ORIGINALLY produced and talented album, she is now the leader of a bunch of \\"wanna be\\" followers that try to sound like her.  I still really dislike her - the way she looks and acts.

0684833395|5.0|What can one say about Catch-22? It's extremely well written and thought out. Full of dark comedy. The biggest thing for me was the way that it managed to literally hit me at the climax of the novel, I felt the same as if I had been physically struck. Powerful book, nothing but pleasure.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I don't consider myself a Foo Fighters fan.  I've enjoyed their songs on the radio, downloaded a couple, sure...  but I never thought of myself as a \\"fan\\".  So I was going out on a limb buying this album, but I'd heard a lot about it and expected big things. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, \\"In Your Honour\\" disapoints.  It has a couple great songs - but out of 20 tracks, three are memorable.  \\"Best of You\\", \\"In Your Honour\\" and \\"Miracle\\" and good songs that stick with me.  But that's it.  Every other song, on both discs, is little more than generic rock/accoustic rock.  There's nothing to these songs that makes them any more appealing than music by Jimmy Eat World or Linkin Park - sure, they might be good rock songs, but there is nothing memorable about the majority of them.  These are not songs than when they come on I immediatly recognize the track. <br /> <br />The Foo Fighters are, in my opinion, a better accoustic band than a rock band.  The accoustic version of \\"Times Like These\\" put me on that idea, and this album cements it.  Dave Grohl's songwriting is decent for the first disc, but the band's skills are much more in evidence with their accoustic set.  Almost as if they were trying to hard to be a \\"hard rock\\" band on disc one. <br /> <br />All in all, three stars.  Good music, for what it's worth.  But certainly nothing amazing or brilliant.
B0009NZ3BO|5.0|Although it's plainly evident from the prior reviews that there is a mastering problem with the first batch of the In'terview re-release, I am rating this 5 stars. This is a classic album from GG. In an effort to avoid scaring off new listeners, my 5 stars will hopefully offset the previous crappy ratings for a problem that will be corrected soon.
B0007YXREA|1.0|This movie is garbage. Sure, this movie is very well done, and is the best pupeteer work EVER, it is horrible other than that. This movie has swears every three seconds. It shows the puppets have sex. It even shows the puppet getting drunk and puking all over the place! It S-U-C-K-S. At the beggininning, the movie has a play called AIDS. IT SUCKS! The puppet pukes. BORIIIING... and is gross. The main guy sucks another man's penis. GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSS! And absolutely unrealistic and retarded. Horrible. The start of the movie where Team America does ten times more damage than the terrorists would have done is hilarious, though. But, it is the only redeeming part of the movie.<BR>     After I finished watching this movie, I was affended and disgusted. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd go to the under world for laughing at this stuff. It was horrible. If the creators of this movie are watching, all the material and working the puppets were awesome, but other than that it sucked. It was gross; stupid, and absolutely dumb. This movie made fun of Matt Damon. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. DON'T WASTE YOUR CASH.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|After reading a few hundred reviews (yes, I was bored), I noticed one of the big complaints is that this movie is that it is 'unimaginative' and 'predictable'. There were also quite a few complaints on the scripting of the film. Keep in mind this film was supposed to be a parody of itself. Then entire movie was shot and made to mimic one of those awful Jerry Bruckheimer (or however you spell it) movies that follow the same formula over and over again. ex. The Rock, Con Air <br /> <br />Also, in response to the idiot that was defending Hollywood actors I have a statement. Hollywood actors are actors, not politicians. The only reason people listen to them is because the media gives them that power. These people don't have the qualifications to consider themselves as experts in global issues. They are just a bunch of hippies whose ideals are unrealistic and shallow. What I find hilarious about Hollywood is that if one idea becomes even remotely popular there, everyone seems to latch onto it for dear life. Of course I'm speaking in generalities, because I'm sure there are a few actors in Hollywood that are decent human beings.  <br /> <br />Anywho, this movie was great. It made fun of all points of view, which is what I believe was intended. It's offensive only to those who are uncomfortable in their ideals, beliefs, and have sheltered themselves from other points of view all their lives. This movie get's the \\"BigD Double Fist Seal of Approval.\\"
B000001FBS|5.0|When I put this CD in for the first time, I thought it would be a worthless piece of garbage. The reputation was terrible, and the cover was weird. I had gotten it from the library, so if it was bad I could just take it back. The first song, &quot;fanfare,&quot; was just flutes and other instruments playing, and, it did sound neat, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I switched the song to The Oath, number 8, and was blown away. Awesome lyrics, heavy guitars, and an amazing Paul Stanley singing. Absolutely awesome.<BR>     The CD is a terrific musical experience, and tells the story of a boy becoming a knight to fight evil. Dark Light has the best Ace solo you can find, and, excels also on Escape From the Island. This album sprung the amazing comic, KISS: PSYCHO CIRCUS by Image, and tells the story of the Elder excellently. This disk may sound a bit weird and dumb to those who worship HOTTER THAN HELL and DESTROYER, but  is a great one for your collection. But be warned! This is not the first CD from KISS you should listen to. Wait until you're done with DESTROYER, then decide for yourself.<BR>     I was also interested with what Donna  had to say about the writing inside the pamphlet. I agree, it is very awesome, but not spine tingling. When she said that, did she mean scary, or very interesting? Either way, before you listen, read it. You're sure to get the idea of the music A LOT better.<br />     I won't hate this disk until GOD turns into a cucumber!<BR>                              * * * * * Five stars.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I agree with the many reviewers that say that is not the best Coldplay album to date BUT, as I sit here listening to X&Y for the about the 10th time, several thoughts come to mind. First, this is a relatively young band. They knocked the ball completely out of the park with their last album. Hopefully, these guys will be around for a while. Like every great band, they will evolve. My inclination is to give these guys a break. Can you imagine what your life would be like if you had the success they had after AROBTTH?  If you listen to the lyrics (which some say are simple) you might wonder what YOU would have said if you had the undivided attention of millions of people around the world. Maybe they are trying to use their enviable position to do some good. Remember, keeping things simple is often the best thing! The opening cut, Square One, is my favorite on the new CD - great beat with some awesome bass lines.  I wish the CD was more upbeat from start to finish, but again, this is their CD and this is what they decided to put forth as their third album. If you still doubt the talent and soul of this young band, go see them in concert!
0596007124|5.0|Disclaimer:  I served as a technical reviewer for several chapters of this book.<br /><br />Understanding design patterns and how they are used in developing an application is a critical skill.  It is important that developers be able to make use of the same lexicon when discussing application architecture.  Books like \\"Design Patterns\\" by Eric Gamma, et al (affectionately referred to as the Gang of Four, or GoF) do well to catalog design patterns and provide this lexicon but they are difficult to use as a guide to learning and understanding design patterns, especially for the less-experience developer.  \\"Head First Design Patterns\\" provides the skills required to learn and understand what design patterns are and how to use them and does it in a fun, easy-to-read way.<br /><br />Although this book does present many of the patterns found in the GoF book, it is not a design pattern catalog.  Its real goal is to help the reader look at their applications in new ways to discover how design patterns can simplify their development efforts.  Patterns are covered in great detail, some may say in almost too much detail, but the end result is a thorough understanding of the patterns under discussion as well as the whole reasoning behind using patterns in the first place.<br /><br />Each pattern is discussed in a similar way.  It generally starts with a programming problem that has been handed to the development team.  They look at a typical, non-design pattern solution and point out the problems with this solution, usually involving issues with making future changes.  The team then starts looking for alternate solutions and discovers a design pattern.  The application is then refactored using the design pattern.  Simplified UML diagrams and easy to follow Java programs are used throughout the book.  All of this is done in an amusing way that will keep the reader interested and not distracted.<br /><br />I can strongly recommend this book for any developer with a sense of humor who wishes to understand design patterns.  Even if you are not a Java programmer, the programs are simple enough for any developer using an object oriented language to understand.  The book does a great job of explaining object oriented design goals and showing how each pattern fits into those goals.  You won't find a discussion of every design pattern known but you will find a highly instructive discussion of some of the most common patterns.  Reading this book will provide you with the skills to understand design patterns and to understand why you should be using them.design patterns.

Hendrix is a mad man and I want more from him.<br /><br />Now I own all 3 studio albums, but there is quite a bit more Hendrix to be found like Blues, South Saturn, Band of Gypseys etc. and they are all suppose to be really darn good.<br /><br />Keep rockin' the guitar Jimi!
0783219598|4.0|Babe is an endearing tale of a talking pig--an a lot of other talking animals--on an eccentric farm run by eccentric Farmer Hoggett.  The plot is quirky and funny, and, yes, rather heartwarming, though it has sad moments, too.<br /><br />Filmed in Australia, the film has enough of the 'place' taken out' that kids from many lands will watch this and think they are seeing their homeland.  That, and the sensational computer-aided talking animal effects, will make the film a must-see for kids under ten.<br /><br />But, wait; Babe is quirky and fun enough that adults will enjoy it, too.  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was caught sneaking out of the theater according to the Washington Post, if I recall!  If he can see Babe, so can you.<br /><br />As an adult, you'll probably love two things.  First, there's an inspiring sound track revolving around variations of Camille Saint-Saen's Organ Symphony.  Next, there's James Cromwell's Oscar-nominated performance as tight-lipped Farmer Hoggett.  If you have only become familiar with this wonderful actor for more recent roles such as the demented new husband in \\"Six Feet Under\\" or the crooked Irish police captain in \\"LA Confidential,\\" this role will surprise and delight you.  The scene where he hoofs and sings the theme song to cheer up Babe the Pig is a delight, evolving from a scratchy lullaby to a sailor's hornpipe, to a full symphonic rendition!  That alone is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />And, yes, one star off for sub-optimal DVD quality, but it isn't that bad.  By all means order this if you haven't seen it!
B000784WMW|5.0|This will be a short review since others have written far better and more eloquent reviews than I would be able to do--I just wanted to add my voice to the concensus. While I was watching this mini-series I was utterly shocked by its faithfullness to the book. That hasn't been my experience at all--most wonderful books are turned into mediocre to awful movies. But with this one--if I wanted to pick the book up and read along with the movie I could do it quite easily, so faithful is this representation of the book.  <br /> <br />My only objection, and it really isn't even an objection, is that I wish it could have been just a LITTLE bit longer because some scenes near the end with Mary, Diana, and St. John seem rushed--but you can't have everything. Zelah Clarke is perfect as Jane and Timothy Dalton has said in the past that he believes that his portrayal of Mr. Rochester in this film is the finest acting he's ever done in his career and I have to say that I agree. He makes a very good Mr. Rochester.  <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on other versions of Jane Eyre the way I have--just get this one. None of the others come close to comparing with it.

It won't be long before they start taking notice as we, the consumers, start showing them where our belief in health care goes.  It's already starting as Keiser Insurance has ads on the radio that are more geared towards maintanance and not so much drugs. <br /> <br />Watch the DVDs, too.  I get something new out of it every time I see the video.  Thanks Dr. Lipton.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I give this album 3.5 stars.  This is the first Coldplay album I have purchased.  I am familiar with some of their previous work from hearing it on the radio, and I liked what I heard.  I guess I would say I am a fan of this type of British art-rock music. On first listen to X&Y I said to myself \\"This sounds just like House of Love.\\"  Anyone remember them?   I also hear elements of Echo & The Bunnymen,The Church,New Order,Ocean Blue,Jesus & Mary Chain,U2,The Stone Roses,Ride, and even Radiohead.  Like I said in my review title-nothing new here.  But that doesn't mean it's all bad.  In fact I rather like X&Y.  Just look at the names of some of the bands I have rattled off here and you can tell I like the lush musical soundscapes created by these types of bands.  I'm giving it 3.5 stars partly because I don't see any originality here, not that that's a bad thing.  An album can still be good without being original.  Maybe it's because I'm becoming a nostalgic old man, but I like the familiarity this album brings.  The other reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is that although I think this album is intense from a musical standpoint, the lyrics on some songs are juvenile and downright silly.  'Fix You' is a great song musically, but the lyrics are just dumb.
B00000K0E5|5.0|After Timothy Dalton's decision to abandon his role as James Bond after only two films, the series was left floundering. Legal issues dogged the production of a new film. Even worse, Bond's classic enemy, the U.S.S.R., collapsed under internal pressures. The promise at the end of Licence To Kill, \\"JAMES BOND WILL RETURN\\", was sounding emptier and emptier by the mid-1990s.  <br /> <br />However, it came together. A suave Irishman by the name of Pierce Brosnan (considered for The Living Daylights but prevented by his contract to a silly 80's detective show known as Remington Steele) was selected for the legendary role. A few characters pounded out a script and story. An assortment of mostly little-known actors and actresses was compiled. And what followed would be one of the most successful, acclaimed, and treasured Bond films ever made; in short, cinema magic. <br /> <br />The story follows Bond through an intriguing turn of events involving a fallen comrade (006) and a stolen Russian satellite with the power to devastate entire cities. (Apparently, the writers couldn't resist one last flick with an evil Russian.) Bond races across Europe and into Cuba to track down and foil the vicious plot to cripple the entire UK. <br /> <br />The casting was near-perfect. Brosnan took no time to step into the role, outdoing Moore, Dalton, and Lazenby breathlessly. (Even Connery may have to admit defeat here.) Sean Bean shines as the crisply arrogant villain. The dazzling Izabella Scorupco   is perfect as the breathtaking and brilliant Natalya Simonova, a Russian programmer who saves Bond as often as he saves her. Famke Janssen sizzles as the wildly insane Xenia Onatopp, a Soviet pilot with impressive combat skills and unusually strong thighs. Robbie Coltrane and Alan Cumming, the supporting Russians, are delightful diversions. And Judi Dench comes through as the new, tough, but ultimately caring M. <br /> <br />The action is gripping; an assault on a Soviet chemical arms factory(with not one, but two heartpounding jumps), a mildly gratuitous car chase down a mountain, the EMP blast on a Siberian computer facility, an escape from an exploding Tiger helicopter, the breakout from a Russian jail, accompanying city-smashing tank chase, train derailment and explosion, attack on the Cuban satellite dish, and final agent vs. agent showdown; you get the picture. <br /> <br />Still, any movie can have sizzling action and quirky casting. But GoldenEye goes further than any of its comrades in the series. The plot is thick with intrigue, and development is paced so we are constantly in suspense. A now-famous scene between Bond and Simonova dives into just who Bond really is. (Aficionados: Don't worry, they get back to the action soon enough.) <br /> <br />In short, GoldenEye is the summit of James Bond movies and an achievement in the history of action movies. Not that you care; you want a flick with stunning women, blazing explosions, and slick one-liners. (It's got that, don't worry.) For the Bond lover, the casual fan, or just someone looking for a damn good movie, GoldenEye is the answer.
B0000009SY|5.0|I am all for a timely re-release of Joe's Garage as the US has become so holy that national security is at risk.<br /><br />Just a few years ago, it was cool to trade cigars with White House interns, but now, all one has to do to make a quick buck is blackmail some politician being baaaaad - and thanks to the overly conservative climate, this is much easier to do.<br /><br />So I suggest we catch them listening to this record, at least then we'll know they have a shred of cool.  This collection of music and ideas is one of the best there is and the musicianship is fantastic as compared to today's standards.<br /><br />Joe's Garage is a must-listen for those with any inclination to \\"get religion\\", or those who have ADD of any sort - it's twisty-turny storytelling vibe will carry you along for the ride.  Don't miss it.

1573223026|4.0|As comic novels go, this book takes on a frightfully tricky subject: suicide. <br />On New Year's Eve in North London, four lost souls go to a roof of a particularly famous suicide point called \\"Topper's House\\" to leap - only to discover a traffic jam (themselves), and, instead of jumping, end up striking up an uneasy alliance/friendship. (\\"Even though we had nothing in common beyond that one thing,\\" as the character Martin states at one point.) That's the high-concept opening and theme of this novel, in a nutshell.<br />The four characters:<br />MARTIN: a disgraced, morning talk-show host who served time in jail for sleeping with an underage girl. Divorced by his wife, humiliated by the media.<br />MAUREEN: a middle-aged, self-sacrificing (and long-suffering) single mom whose only son is a virtual vegetable. A Catholic who states (p. 77): \\"I don't believe in luck as much as punishment.\\" She had sex once, with only one man - which resulted in a child, the cross she had to bear (and could no longer bear).<br />JESS: a bratty, impulsive, volatile, foul-mouthed rebel teen, daughter of a well-known government official.<br />JJ: a 30-ish \\"failed\\" American musician (leader of the defunct cult band, Big Yellow) - now turned pizza delivery boy. (A character most resembling Rob from High Fidelity)<br />The novel is told from the point of view of these four characters - that is, in alternating monologues (reminding me of William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying - one of Oprah's Summer picks). <br />At one point a significant reference is made to Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse, in which the character of Jess suggests the author \\"killed herself because she couldn't make herself understood.\\"<br />What's unfolds then, in this novel, is the characters finding the WORDS to their despair.<br />WHAT I LOVED:<br />The humor. Given this horribly dark subject matter, Nick Hornby continually finds a way to make his material and situations amusing.<br />WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE:<br />Finding thishorribly dark subject matter amusing.<br />Part of the problem with Nick Hornby is that he is a comic novelist in the traditional sense. (As with Shakespeare's comedies, it is the happy ending that defines it as such.)<br />I kept thinking that this novel might work better as a play or a skit. The opening on the roof is very theatrical, almost like a Samuel Beckett play (full of gallows humor). There rest of the book, essentially, is a series of monologues. <br />Some people may find A Long Way Down a little shallow, a little contrived and glib, like a TV sitcom run amok. Hornby constantly undermines the seriousness of his subject matter in order to make it bearable; but in doing so he also undermines the weight of it; in a way, he sort of paints himself into a corner from the beginning. The rest of the novel is about Hornby writing himself out of the hole. Give him credit for courage, though.<br />All the negative aspects aside -- there are A LOT of laugh-out-loud passages in this book; there's enough humor and wit and liveliness for me to recommend it. His writing is still a pleasure to read, his characters full of attitude and intensely likeable, and after The Loser's Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez (another recent Amazon favorite of mine), I'm still recommending Nick Hornby's A Long Way Down. Maybe not his best -- High Fidelity still commands that spot -- but still good, a comic novel stretching the limits of what a comic novel should be.
B000002UVX|5.0|The Band of Gypsys is a prime example of the virtuosity and the greatness of Jimi Hendrix.  He was like a Picasso on guitar.  If you consider that Hendrix first toured in the Chitlin' Circuit with Little Richard, and was basically undiscovered in the USA as a solo artist until that guy from the UK band, \\"the animals,\\" found him in Greenich Village in 1965. <br /> <br />We all know what happened next.  Jimi went off to the UK and played some shows with the Experience in London.  And he stunned an audience of the biggest stars in England, like Keith Richards, Pete Townsend and Paul MCcartney etc. <br /> <br />They all felt like they had witnessed some alien musician from another galaxy coming down to earth to show them how it is really done.  They all went back to the drawing board and Jimi  single handedly had changed rock, and music in general from that point forward. <br /> <br />Well, the Band of Gypsys was Jimi's most artistic project.  And this was the first live performance of the group.  Live on New Year's Eve in 1969 in New York City.  The audience which can be heard on the recording was obviously stunned by Jimi's departure into a more funky, hard rock sound.  This is best displayed on the track \\"Machine Gun,\\" dedicated to those fighting in Chicago, New York, and yeah to the soldiers fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br />Get this record. It is a time capsule taking us back to that night in New York when the sixties were coming to an end and we were headed into the more funk laden 70s.  Jimi was right there to take us forward, once again. <br /> <br />Peace and music.
0451528018|4.0|With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers.  Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of the Baskervilles, which an American, Sir Henry Baskerville, has just inherited upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles.  The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night--one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a young woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor.  The lecherous Baskerville, following the dog closely, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\"  The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall.  Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader).  By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of  interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise.  The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate.  Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

B00007LTIA|5.0|Nothing in the world of rock music has ever dared delve into the ideas, both musical and idealogical that this album attempted to achieve. There will never again be a time when anybody would take a work such as this seriously. I can't imagine how it would sound to a first time listener today, since it is such a product of its paradigm.<br /><br />Hence, it is difficult to appraise honestly.<br /><br />Is it padded? Mercilessly on Remembering. Would I change a note? No way.<br /><br />Is it the work of a band at their best? Not at all. Only on Ritual does one get the impression that everybody is actually playing the same song.<br /><br />But as an expression of a vision, it is matchless. You could argue that Close To The Edge did a better job of this, but it was a group vision in many respects.<br /><br />It remains the only album I can listen to after 30 years and still hear something new each time. And it still leaves me wondering, how did they do it when half the band weren't really into it.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|\\"Apollo 13\\" is my favorite dramatic movie of all time. The Apollo program still intrigues me, and I still regard it as the greatest technological triumph in the history of the world. Before Ron Howard made this movie, most people had forgotten about Apollo other than knowing that men walked on the moon (though there are those that dispute even that now): some could recall Neil Armstrong's name, but few could remember anything more.<br /><br />Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did the world a great favor by reminding people of the human risk and personal sacrifice required by the Astronauts and their families. \\"Apollo 13\\" is not only a great work of cinema; it is a great historical document that will last long after the last of the Apollo Astronauts has passed on.<br /><br />The film itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking effects, and many scenes filmed in the NASA C-135 \\"Vomit Comet\\" parabolic flight \\"Zero-G\\" aircraft. This film stands the test for realism and drama. I am extremely familiar with the Apollo mission profiles, and am impressed by the accuracy of the production, although certain concessions to absolute accuracy were made to tell the story in two hours out of necessity, and many of the technical conversations include background information that the real participants would not have bothered with as it would be obvious information to them. Nonetheless, the film is very authentic looking, which I attribute to the Howard and Hanks authenticity requirements, as well as having Dave Scott as a technical advisor.<br /><br />The extras are great; I particularly liked the other Apollo 13 documentary, although I was a bit less enthused by the \\"Conquering Space\\" offering. The best extra is the commentary track with Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which explains what they like about the film, interesting backstory information, and occasional technical corrections from Jim.<br /><br />This is the best drama I have ever seen. Buy this one today: it's a keeper.

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|good this dvd came out!!, it fills my collection now -->  <br />5 hours of original MTV footage. Hey in 1985 i was 18 and i had more things to do on a summer day A saturday at that, than to sit around a tv watching this classic and cutting commercials. <br /> <br />and my 8 hour tape VH1 had for the live aid 10th anniversary replay in 1995 (filled in alot of holes from stuff i didnt record in 1985)..if anyone has this tape you'll know ALOT of the Wembley show was replayed here. <br /> <br />The DVD has its place, but truly has a lot of footage missing, i think for the effort & amount of time that has passed for this classic, a few things can be said <br /> <br />1. how could MTV NOT have had their tapes ROLLING for this for their FILM library???, correct me if im wrong, but not since woodstock has something of this magnitude hit the airwaves and MTV was just a camera outlet ?? very disappointing for this and may be the reason why so much was omitted from the DVD as the classic footage is indeed lost. but the the 8 hour special VH1 aired back in 1995?? where were they in the mix? puzzling why so much was omitted really it is.. <br /> <br />2. if the DVD project was in the works, it should have been coordinated and as much as they want to put together a good product for a good cause (and thats what the enthusiasts will say about Live aid in general), and the remaster ers should have sought out to the internet community because I like many other posts here DO HAVE ALOT OF ORIGINAL LIVE AID FOOTAGE!!! just in Mono and after dusting off my tapes--I was quite amazed in that I do not have such bad video quality..even if they couldnt of remastered that it would have been nice to have it on DVD in its raw form anyway. <br /> <br />The DVD is good, but for the GOOD cause they are trying to lure people into buying it, should have been as great as the day it aired. To which it is not, though worth owning by all means!! It falls short of re-capturing the mark of what truly wentdown that day, and with Live 8 this weekend, tapes will be rolling once again. Though I dont feel that same snazz i remember back in 1985, it'll be good to watch, I think <br /> <br />DVD is good, own it..
B00097A5HW|5.0|I bought this album just because her English debut was so darned good. This is even better. She sounds so much better and confident in Spanish. She's natural. I loved Laundry Service and heard it again and again but I always thought she was a bit under-confident. Here she has blended so many different styles and genres together that the only genre I could put her under was 'Latin'. I really hope Vol.2 is just as good. La Tortura is everywhere! Tv, radio etc. and rightly so. It really is the best track on the album according to me. Next would come 'Obtener Un S'. A really good jazz track. Very nice. Though I feel that I've already heard that tune somewhere before. Dunno....  <br />The Shaketon mix of Tortura is also decent but that beat is also really familiar. Something like a Madonna American life beat.... 'No' is also a great slow track and as I've read is going to be her next single. Also good. 'La Pared' is a great track. I preferred the acoustic version (also on the album). Somehow leaves room for her voice and I think she sounds much better without the synth. <br />I would recommend anyone to buy this album. Even if you haven't heard any of her earlier stuff, it'll do fine if you start of with this one. It is her best work to date. December come soon...
B000002KOQ|5.0|`Ladies of the Canyon' is Joni Mitchell's third album, originally released on LP in 1970, and it has the sound of a `Greatest Hits' album, as virtually every cut is pure, classic Joni. As it is also the album released just before I saw her perform live, it is the one which is most indelibly engraved on my consciousness.<br /><br />Having grown up on the fringes of the 1960's counterculture steeped in Joan Baez and Judy Collins, it took a few years for me to realize that the true distaff counterpart of Bob Dylan was not these luminaries, but the very talented and incredibly original Ms. Mitchell from Canada.<br /><br />At least two tracks on this album, `Big Yellow Taxi' and `Woodstock' have become counterculture anthems. An yet, Joni is much less intent on the political like Dylan (at least up to `Blond on Blond') than on the very personal and existential aspects of life. Many of her songs on this album such as `The Circle Game' strike me as immensely beautiful castles of words and music build on the slightest of observations, recalling the famous encounter between Marcel Proust and his Madelaine crumbs in his tea.<br /><br />The only female artist I can think of who even comes close to Joni Mitchell in the quality of her songwriting may be Sandy Denny, who however, may be mostly a one trick pony, as she did not develop far beyond her great song `Who Knows Where the Time Goes'. In comparison, Joni Mitchell has three or four songs on this album which stir the heart as strongly as Denny's one major song.<br /><br />If you are discovering Joni Mitchell for the first time, start with this album.

B0009NSE1K|5.0|The always hard to categorize Clutch are becoming even more hard to categorize with each passing album. These guys are both hardworking and relentlessly creative. This disc is a little less metallic and more experimental than their last outing, the great Blast Tyrant. However, that old Clutch heaviness is still plentiful here, especially in the neckpain-inducing \\"Burning Beard\\" and the strangely angular \\"Circus Maximus.\\" The best aspect of Clutch's approach is the jam-oriented interactions between the disarmingly funky basslines of Dan Maines and the off-kilter stoner-metal riffs of Tim Sult, built upon drummer Jean Paul Gaster's driving and genre-jumping rhythms. Meanwhile, singer Neil Fallon sounds more and more like he's drowning in oppressive political and religious demagoguery, and this describes both his cryptic lyrics and his riot-inciting vocals.<br /><br />The biggest development for Clutch here is the addition of fulltime keyboardist Mick Schauer, who has been fully integrated into the band's sound, instead of just adding ornamentation. This has pushed Clutch further into an unmistakable classic rock and blues sound, evident in the surprisingly no-nonsense tunes \\"10001110101\\" and \\"10,000 Witnesses.\\" There are even a few snippets of balladry here, like in the verses of \\"Land of Pleasant Living.\\" Most unexpectedly, the album ends with two reverential 12-bar blues workouts. The first is a lyrical cover of Mississippi Fred McDowell's \\"Gravel Road\\" on top of slammin' Clutch-created blooze mayhem; this is followed by a full cover of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Who's Been Talking.\\" You might just think that Clutch is evolving into an older and wiser blues band (albeit a strange one), but I bet they'll add a new element or three to their sound on the next album.

0786852550|3.0|This book is a near hit due to its incredible creativity, but misses due to two main mistakes.  First, the \\"hero\\" boy, Nathanial, is a self serving creep.  His entire motivation is REVENGE.  Ugh.  Hardly admirable.  I didn't want to cheer for him and wouldn't have even minded if he failed in his task of stopping the bad magician.  (I didn't see Nathanial as much better than the bad magician.  They're both egotistical, revengeful creeps.)  The djinni is great, however.  Loved him.  The second problem with this book is that it's incredibly wordy.  When Nathanial attends a fancy event, the book spends four pages describing the drive there and PARKING!  I kid you not!  Cut to the chase.  There was a paragraph-long description of a door (yawn).  A good editor should have shortened it to heighten the tension and excitement.  So . . . I recommend it if you like long, wordy novels with revengeful, self serving heroes.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|This is what happens when a band goes mainstream. The CD is mediocre. Serj seriously doesn't need to be pushed to backup vocals. He's an awesome singer and the other guy is just a squeeky mouse. What happened to you SOAD? Your first CD was amazing and original. Now, your just another band.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is quite an excellent album. Before I go any further I would like to menson that on this cd, every song is worth listening too. It's hard nowadays to find an album, and a band, that is good enough not to need fillers. Some listeners might find the album's sound and overall \\"feeling\\" repetitive. I believe, however, this is due to the lack of guitar. Most modern music listeners are accustomed to having a guitar either providing a full sound or giving the music another added element. This is not an issue for this group. The piano part is extremely full and provides an ample sound for all of the songs.  My favorites are \\"Bend and Break\\", \\"Everybody's Changing\\", but my favorite song off the album is \\"Your Eyes Open\\". If you're finiky about your cd purchases and don't find the current musical climate hospitable, Keane is a warm current from the gulf. Listeners will find it refreshing and bueatiful. <br />

B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning (Metallica's 2nd album, 1984)    In 1983, the men of Metallica rocked hard with their popular debut, Kill em All, but it wasn't until their second release that they truly revealed their talent, as Ride the Lightning is an incredible metal CD.  It's also of their heaviest albums, according to smashing-hard rockers like \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" and \\"Trapped Under Ice\\".  With heavy guitar riffs, awesome solos, and great drum rhythms, the sound rocks on, but even the lyrics stand extremely deep and aren't too hard for anyone to receive the message they possess.  Metallica rages with their strong, well-written lyrics specifically about war, slavery, and death, but the nice thing is that the deep lyrics and rocking music fit together beautifully on here.  Still, the TRUE piece that makes Ride the Lightning a classic is that Metallica is never afraid to mix their music around.  True, all eight tracks are more than four minutes long, but since the intriguing music and excellent solos thrown into them keeps the listener interested, they feel shorter than they actually are.  In fact, they're all so complex, that I have no choice but to give a small review for all of them:    1. Fight Fire with Fire (4:44):  This song slowly opens as an acoustic song, but once the speed picks up, you'll know that you're in for quite a ride.  A great track about war that worthily opens the album.    2. Ride the Lightning (6:36):  Another great rocker.  Although not quite as fast-paced as the last track, the song ironically feels more intense with its more-solid production and stronger lyrics than the previous track.  This song gives a great feeling as to why fighting is extremely painful.    3. For Whom the Bell Tolls (5:10):  The biggest song from Ride the Lightning.  Here, you'll hear a clock tower bell during the beginning and end of the song, as well as production that's even slower than the last track, but adds a nice streamy flavor to the album.  As yet another anti-war song off of here, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is also an awesome track to listen to.    4. Fade to Black (6:56):  Partially-acoustic during the verses and slow-metal during the music, this semi-ballad is a deep song with a message about dying.  Notice the addition of a little more speed and a new melody during the second half.  Although the music isn't as thrilling as other stuff found here, its awesome lyrics help make it the best song off here.    5. Trapped under Ice (4:03):  Another awesome fueled-up rocker with powerful lyrics, this time about being in peril.    6. Escape (4:23):  Although this isn't as fast as \\"Trapped under Ice\\", it has brilliant lyrics with a message that says, \\"I am on my side, and will fight as much as I can to obtain freedom\\".  The drums here are catchy, and that's a good thing.    7. Creeping Death (6:36):  This song takes you back in time to the story of Exodus, and the point of view focuses on the angel of death.  The melody is great and matches the lyrics nicely.    8. The Call of Ktulu (8:52):  Easily the longest track off Ride the Lightning.  It's instrumental, so it highly focuses on the music quality.  It opens quite slowly, with nothing more than a guitar melody with only quiet bass sounds in the background, but then picks up and starts to pass through with excellent bass lines and great solos.  Within five minutes of the song, the drums come more into the action while the song's melodies slowly begin to rise until the original bass notes come in while the drums hit every beat of them.  Then, the original melody continues for a short time until the song enters a period with drum syncopation.  Afterward, it slows down again, but soon afterward finishes off with a few hardcore riffs.    With all things said, Ride the Lightning is indeed Metallica's greatest effort.  Even the cover art tells you that you're in for a big ride.  With its brilliant lyrics, awesomely-rocking music, and great solos, Ride the Lightning is definitely an albumworthy of the Metallica title, so if you're buying into hardcore music, this is absolutely a must-have.
0805079076|5.0|An excellent addition to my collection of popular nonfiction books on language.  Deutscher explains how language changes over time.  The discussion of metaphors is fascinating.  His final theory on why languages have tended toward simplicity in case systems is quite convincing.  This is a five-star book moving towards four stars.  While it is brilliantly conceived and has some stunning insights, the book is too laden with examples and feels padded at times--you can almost hear the editor saying, \\"Bring in more examples, expand the book a bit\\".  But this is a relatively minor criticism.  This is an excellent book.
0783117523|5.0|I love this movie! Gia is a very haunting and thought evoking true story about a models tragice life. The character of Gia is extraordinarliy played by Angelina Jolie. This is one you have to see if you have ever thought for a moment that models or beautiful people all live much more happily than the rest of us. It is a look at the real raw side of the \\"business\\" and what it does to these beautiful girls. Before you decide it is not the kind of movie you're into, you have to see it ........just once. <br /> <br />
B000083C49|5.0|Admiral Kirk--or should I say CAPTAIN Kirk--and the rest of the Enterprise crew go back in time to save the world in the 23rd century.  How do they save the world?  By bringing two humpback whales into the future to talk to a probe in space that is destorying the Earth.<br /><br />  This is my favorite \\"classic Trek\\" movies. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but that's what makes it enjoyable.  This also stars Catherine Hicks from \\"7th Heaven\\"
B000083C49|5.0|I have several friends who acted as if I had grown another head when I said that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was my favorite Star Trek film. Star Trek II had the epic battle between Khan and Kirk as well as the (supposed) death of Mr. Spock. Star Trek VI had a great whodunit mystery and the final sendoff of the original crew. Star Trek VIII: First Contact had the inspiring story of how the Next Generation crew saved postwar Earth from the Borg and thus helped humankind begin its idealistic journey towards the foundation of Starfleet. Star Trek IV, however, \\"just had a bunch of whales and a lot of dumb humor.\\" They said that the latter quality was especially out of place since the original series was so serious in tone. And that's where I had them. <br /> <br />True fans of the original series know that it had loads of humor. From Spock and Dr. McCoy's verbal battles to Kirk getting buried under tons of tribbles to Kirk and Spock's impersonation of old Chicago gangsters to the Enterprise crew's tangles with Harry Mudd, the series was rife with comic relief that made the characters all the more appealing. Even the most serious episodes had moments of humor. For example, in the classic City on the Edge of Forever, when Kirk and Spock travel back to New York City circa 1930, Kirk must try to explain Spock's appearance to a police officer. He explains that Spock is Chinese and that his ears are the result of getting his head caught in a rice picker. The scene is hilarious and works beautifully even within the very serious story line. <br /> <br />That's why Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home works so well. It has an entertaining story that even non-Star Trek fans can enjoy. But it still remains faithful to the tone and character of the original show. Gene Roddenberry and crew brilliantly addressed problems in modern society through the use of science fiction. In this case, the crew of the Enterprise must counter 20th Century man's short sightedness by retrieving two humpback whales -- which are extinct in the 23rd Century -- so they can communicate with an alien probe that will destroy the Earth unless it can communicate with the whales. As Spock says, \\"To hunt a series to extinction is illogical.\\" The audience can't help but agree. <br /> <br />But Leonard Nimoy, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, does not beat the audience over the head with the message. The previous two films were very heavy and serious in nature, so Nimoy opts for a light touch reminiscent of episodes like \\"The Trouble with Tribbles,\\" \\"I, Mudd\\" and \\"A Piece of the Action\\" from the original series. Kirk and company must deal with hostile traffic in 1986 San Francisco, bus drivers demanding exact change, punk rockers with 40 decibel boom boxes, an ornery female marine biologist and other hazards of the 20th Century. After watching Spock's death, the Enterprise crew's mutiny against Starfleet, the death of Kirk's son and the destruction of the Enterprise, the jovial, humorous tone of this film is a welcome change. <br /> <br />Naturally Star Trek fans will get the most out of the film. When Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) and mother Amanda (Jane Wyatt) appear, a dedicated Trekker can't help but remember the great episode \\"Journey to Babel\\" where we learned of Spock's complicated and often hostile relationship with his father. And when we see the brand new Enterprise at the end of the film, only Star Trek fans can truly appreciate what a happy moment it is. <br /> <br />But the fact that this film was the most commercially successful of the series -- over $100 million in 1986 -- shows that general audiences and not just Star Trek fans found the film entertaining and appealing. Roger Ebert, who was very lukewarm about most of the other entries in the series, raved about The Voyage Home. Star Trek fans have always seen the films as surrogate family reunions. The actors playing the characters may have aged and gained weight, but the fans loved seeing Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov return for another adventure. Star Trek IV, however, allows even non Trekkers to enjoy the reunion.
B00000I2UC|2.0|The Jesus and Mary Chain - Automatic (1989)<br /><br />. . . but my appreciation for this band is highly unorthodox. I like the _sound_ on PSYCHOCANDY, but don't think the songs themselves are really that great, even though it's still widely considered to be their best album. My favorite J&MC record by far is HONEY'S DEAD with its killer guitar & feedback washes, pounding dance beats and, above all, mostly great songs. Second favorite would be the laid-back, super-cool strum-fest singalongs on STONED AND DETHRONED. To be perfectly honest, it's been several years since I've heard AUTOMATIC as I basically dismissed it as not worth returning to with so much other great music around I still wanted to hear. Only \\"Head On\\" remains notable in my mind as it was covered by one of my old favorites, The Pixies.<br /><br />So I don't expect many people to share my exact opinions of this band, but I think it's kinda useless the way so many on this forum vote that a review is \\"not helpful\\" because it doesn't exactly mirror their particular opinions. Maybe this little review will point some people in a worthwhile direction for them if they can appreciate an unusual but sincere point of view.
B0000062Y2|4.0|I love JCS. Lets get get that straight first. The original (Concept) album was playing all through my childhood. And I loved it. The movie was a spiritual and amazing rock experience. So, many years later when I saw the original movie soundtrack on CD in a pawn shop, I jumped on it. (This is not the remastered version.) The songs are great, and tonight I just finished watching the remastered DVD. Now, I thought the audio quality on the CD was bad. But I expected this because it was from an old original soundtrack. But now that I have seen and heard the remastered DVD movie, I am blown away! The images and the music are on par with a modern classic! This made me realize that the CD soundtrack was even worse than I thought. Whatever they did to the remastered movie, they should do to the remastered CD! I think I am going to just burn off a copy of the DVD audio just for my own pleasure! P.S. I will be attending the live version of JCS for the first time in just a few days! Then I can compare that experience as well!
B00000ING2|4.0|I'm not going to break down the storyline, characters, and other technicalities because I think everyone else has done a sufficient job of that on this review section.  But I do highly recommend seeing this movie. The Hudsucker Proxy may not be the Coen brothers best or most widely accepted work to date, but it's definitely worth checking out if you like their other films that are more family oriented like O Brother Where Art Thou and Raizing Arizona.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|offspring is a real good band, no questions asked.  over the trials and tribulations the band has been through in the past decade or so, I think we all should allow the band some lee-way with the album.  It may not be the best, but it's entertaining and fun.  as an artist, just let them do what they want, and enjoy the music instead of listening to it with only a critical mind.  it defeats the purpose of music.  thanks for diversifying offspring and not playing the same stuff every other punk band does.  punk can be fast and original, and not be 4 chords and a bridge all the time.  give it a chance, and if you don't like it, go listen to NOFX (whom i love dearly) and notice how just about every one of their songs is the EXACTLY the same, with a few exceptions.  rock on.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|The thing I like best about robots is its originality. You keep seeing new computer animated movies coming out and they're either copied ideas from previous ones, or they're just plain not funny. Or both. Shark Tale, to name one. The Incredibles had enough action and stuff in it to make up for the lack of belly-shaking humor, but it still could've been better. <br /> <br />Robots has some hilarious sequences in it. Namely, Rodney and Fenders armpit moment, in which everyone in the house joins in *most memorable line* - \\"Aunt Fanny, we were using our ARMS!!!\\" Another sequence that made me split was Fender's dance moment. The idea of Robin William's robot wearing a small skirt and dancing is funny enough; combine it with Britney Spears' hit Baby One More Time and you've got serious funniness. <br /> <br />All in all, robots rates right up there with Shrek and Finding Nemo. Every family should own it.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is one album, that gets better with each listening, the worst song has to be the B.Y.O.B. but don't get me wrong that song is a very nice 9.5 out of 10 stars.  This album will kick you when you need it songs like Revenge, and Radio/Video, have you singing the hooks and melody, but be careful these songs have hidden meanings, and subliminal hints like Cigaro, Lost in Hollywood and Old School Hollywood.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I went to Green Day's American Idiot concert in May 2005 in Peoria, IL, and man, I tell you I had a blast! These guys really sound good live on stage. The song \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" sounded awesome when they played it live. At the concert, I was shocked to see so many kids there, ranging from six year olds to teenagers to no longer kids (mature folks). I'm forty, and I have a six year old son who loves the American Idiot album. When he's with me in the car, everytime I play the songs, \\"American Idiot\\" and the \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", I tune out the parts where there's explicit words because, I just don't like to hear my six year old singing them with explicit words. He's too young for that. All in all I love the album. Wish Green Day has another version of American Idiot album without explicit lyrics so my son and I can enjoy it without tuning out the bad words for him.
0446343129|5.0|I read this book when I was in my early 20s and immediately gave up sugar.  Back then (early 1980s)it was much more difficult to find substitutes; I remember buying carob bars sweetened with honey at a health food store and making \\"candy\\" by combining peanut butter, powdered milk, honey and raisins.  These were my only \\"sweet indulgences.\\"  I was determined never to touch refined sugar again.  Within a few months I was at my slimmest ever (5'-8\\", 125 lbs), despite that I continued to eat very high-fat foods such as pizza, burgers, steaks (with butter on them!), corn chips and french fries.  So long as it didn't contain sugar, it was fair game.  I felt great and had tons of energy.  Unfortunately my mother poo-pooed the whole idea of sugar being bad, and continuously tried to undermine my efforts by concocting huge, beautiful desserts whenever I visited.  Eventually I gave in when she urged me to \\"just have a little piece\\" of German chocolate cake.  It was all downhill from there.  It had been too long since I read this wonderful book (about two years); apparently I'd forgotten its lessons.<br /><br />Now, over 20 years later, I have kicked sugar again.  I wish I had never gone back to it in the first place.  I have currently been sugar-free for just over two months, and despite that I continue to eat high-fat foods and do not exercise at all (LOL - yup, gotta be honest here), I have lost at least ten pounds.  (Since I don't have a scale, I have to rely on my monthly doctor's visits to find out my weight.)  I feel more energetic and I'm able to sleep through the night for the first time in at least a year without using sleeping pills.  (Goodbye, expensive Ambien!!!)<br /><br />I found it much easier to kick my sugar habit this time around, given the many sugar-free products that exist due to the low-carb dieting craze.  You'll find, however, that your cravings all but disappear.  I keep one bag of sugar-free York peppermint patties in my desk at work and one at home, and a box of sugar-free Fudgicles in my freezer.  This way if I do get an occasional craving, I can look right past my husband's sugar-laden ice cream, candy bars and cookies.  Yes, artificial sweeteners are supposed to be bad for you also, but as rarely as I eat them, I'm not at all worried.  If you read this book, you'll not want refined white sugar anywhere near you.  Some day I'll get my husband to try this; he has been diagnosed with clinical depression and never has any energy.  He drinks a two-liter bottle of cola every day and eats ice cream and cookies every night.  (Sugar blues, anyone?)  Like William Dufty and his wife, Gloria Swanson, I'd love for us both to live well into our late 80s, looking and feeling great!ome, and a box of sugar-free Fudgicles in my freezer.

0790729652|5.0|This is the best of the four Batman movies hand down; The didnt waste time on a poor story and didnt have cheesy effects like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. The acting rivals Batman Begins but there is one very very big mistake in the movie that apparently no one has ever noticed. Harvey Dent is black in this movie...who is Harvey Dent? Two Face and he's white, not black. Dont know why people never caught onto this, unless there was apparently two Harvery Dents in Gotham
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is a classic movie starring paul walker and vin deisel. I use to think walker was hot but he is so boyish and too pretty boy for me, like the nsync metro-sexual (heterosexual guys who dress pretty and look gay but are not) I'm more into manly men like vin deisel. He is the sexiest guy i've ever seen. And so is michelle rodrigez. In fact if i were given one opportunity to have one threesome with anyone my first choice would be vin deisel and michelle rodrigez, who dated a while ago. But back to this movie, sorta bad influence on teenage boys who think it's cool to race cars but if it's not taken seriously then it's ok, because it's only for entertainment. Good music, good drama, some humor, and overall good action movie with good actors. But Vin Desiel is the best and when i found out he wasn't in the sequel i didnt wanna even see it at first but i did, in theatre's and it was ok, but a little bit over the top. Some overacting, and to me the asian model that was in the sequel wasn't even that cute. The one that raced at the beginning and as she raced she did a jump over a bridge i think it was and said SPANK MY ASS. I don't know kinda cheesy, lol.
0060934719|5.0|Years ago I remember thinking--with a great degree of sadness--that I would never find another writer as interesting and unique as Tolkien. Fortunately, Neil Gaiman has provided material that forces me to re-examine my assumption.<br /><br />My first experience with Gaiman was \\"American Gods\\". While it remains my favorite of his works, \\"Stardust\\" comes in as a close second. It may be unfair, though, to compare the two works. \\"Stardust\\" is a fairy tale in the purest sense, while \\"American Gods\\" is a dark, urban adventure with deep roots in the mythologies of the world.<br /><br />When I find a book I enjoy, I usually read it more than once. Alright, I usually read it several times. \\"Stardust\\" has endured at least five reads. Like all the best stories, it yields new insights each time. While this work can certainly be enjoyed by young adult readers, Gaiman weaves subtleties and suggestions that will make the book every bit as rewarding for adult readers.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is a tale of a young man who goes in search of his heart's desire. The plot is pretty straightforward. What makes this read fantastic are the characters. I most enjoyed the banter between the two primary characters Tristran (a young man in the process of discovering what it is he truly desires) and Yvaine (a fallen star who is learning to cope with her new surroundings, while trying to evade the witches who seek to cut out her heart). I found the secondary characters in this work to be equally entertaining-not for their depth, but because they are so delightfully wicked.<br /><br />All who have enjoyed both the darkness and the light of the Brothers Grimm will also enjoy this work of Gaiman.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|I dunno what some other reviewer is on about when they say Sabbath is usually \\"Old fasioned and boring\\", as Sabbath were always interesting innovators and way ahead of their time! (Perhaps they've been listening to another band called Black Sabbath). But nonetheless, this is an excellent album, with Iommi's usual awesome riffs, fine vocals from Tony Martin and Cozy Powell is great behind the kit. I'd recommend this to anybody who's interested in hearing some post-Ozzy Sabbath.
B0006399FS|3.0|City Of Blinding Lights is one song that stands out on this album with one of the most sleep inducing album covers.But that's okay,it's not as if I purchased it.I like City because it belongs to another time & place. Quite possibly among my top 5 U2 songs. I wouldn't call myself a fan. I appreciate works on albums like Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but then like another much glorified reviewer said I don't connect with them.<br /><br />I don't get the deal behind Vertigo.It won a grammy. Now let's just see you and me. If you ask a person of average prudence they will instantly hear the over similarity with an older U2 song. It won a grammy.MIND YOU I dislike Bono's vocals. On u2's best song (With Or Without You) I can't help but wish he sang a lot louder.No volume pleases the ultimate effect the great song could have had.Anyhow,Im not supposed to confuse people looking to read reviews so I'll go on.<br /><br />\\"A Man And A Woman\\" is a good song. You can give it twenty half attentive listens outta your time and still be happy.\\"feel free\\" made me smile the first time I heard it but believe me it's not something I'd recommend people who depend on me for music.Moving on,Montogomery's Visit is a bad song. I keep waiting for it to begin but it seems U2's too busy trying to tell people that we experiment. Ah jeez.<br /><br />\\"Neon Lights\\" could have been around twice as good if it wasn't Bono singing.It's not his song.It's a song with good music,good melody but it's not for Bono to be sung.I think the vocalist is the center of a music band and his voice is just too ineffective for me to appreciate.(Bono gives his best to City Of Blinding Lights.It's something I'm sure will not go unrecognised.)<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\" is one of the best songs on the discs. I'm sure all U2 fans would appreciate it.<br /><br />Please see,I haven't heard \\"fast cars\\"<br /><br />Don't buy. Buy Coldplay instead.
0790731002|3.0|Wild horses couldn't stop me from watching a movie featuring both Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore, but Batman Forever does have some problems, and reactions to the film probably break down to different viewers' image of the Batman story.  If all you care about are Wam! Pow! moments, this film is right up your alley.  Batman traditionalists such as myself look upon Batman as the Dark Knight - with emphasis on the Dark.  While this film does attempt to examine the psyche of the man who is both Bruce Wayne and Batman, it doesn't do it very effectively - and all substantive parts of the story are completely lost amidst all of the flashy Gotham sets and the over-acting of both Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.  It really pains me to watch a talented actor such as Jones indulge in the types of ridiculous shenanigans of this movie's Two-Face (and I say this movie's Two-Face because this is basically a silly caricature of the real Two-Face).  The most annoying thing about Batman Forever, though, is its shamelessness at throwing in criminally bad puns that almost make a mockery of the Batman series - e.g., the whole \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman!\\" shtick.  The writer and director really ought to be ashamed of themselves for that one.<br /><br />Basically, what you have in this film is the re-entry of Two-Face, the introduction of the Riddler, and the birth of \\"Robin.\\"  You also get a beautiful psychologist thrown into the mix to help Batman get in touch with his feelings.  I adore Nicole Kidman, but her character ended up being little more than bait for catching Batman.  It's not all her fault, though; it's not easy to get a character as wooden as Val Kilmer's Batman to open up.  We all know that Batman internalizes his feelings, but Vilmer could easily be mistaken for a block of wood in a bat suit.  Jim Carrey, on the other hand, emotes like the neon lights that clutter every piece of scenery in this new vision of Gotham.  The Riddler is an over-the-top character, but Carrey perhaps goes too far; he's good for laughs early on, but you can't help but be sick of him before the end.  The Riddler's invention - which allows him to suck the knowledge out of people's heads as they watch his new-fangled TV \\"box,\\" is just plain silly.  Then there's Chris O'Donnell, the troubled youth who, after watching his parents die, discovers Bruce Wayne's secret and insinuates himself into the role of his sidekick.  Certainly, he is affected by the death of his parents, but young Master Grayson's character just doesn't ring true here, as he really is quite a pain in the posterior.<br /><br />Naturally, we have to relive the murder of Wayne's parents and see the genesis of his determination to become a dark avenger in order to see how this traumatic experience impacts his less than normal psychological health, but everything else consists of special effects-laden brouhahas organized by Two-Face and the Riddler.  It's a classic case of style over substance, which in this case involves an over-the-top style that just gets sillier as you go along.  Batman being Batman, he falls for one stupid trap after another, yet always manages to escape.  We're basically expected to ooh and aah over all the glaring lights of busy Gotham and the seemingly endless supply of nifty Batman gadgets and thus overlook the fact that the story itself isn't presented very well at all.  You have to wonder what would happen if one of the theatrical Batmans ever took on a bad guy who wasn't insanely stupid.perhaps goes too far; he's good for laughs early on, but you can't help but be sick of him before the end.

B0009A1AS2|3.0|I have been a big DT fan since Images and Words.  This album is definitely different.  I do enjoy several of the songs, however what threw me off is the blatant Muse Influence.  Listen to track 6, it sounds like it might have been written by Muse and performed by DT.  I agree with several of the other reviews, where are the odd time signatures.  After listeing to the album several times I learned to really enjoy it.  This album is by far better than Train of Thought.
0671004611|5.0|When it comes to UFOs - that's Unidentified Flying Objects, mind you, not Alien Spacecraft - there are three types of people. Category \\"A\\" does not believe that such exist and will never believe, regardless of evidence to the otherwise. At the other end of the spectrum, Category \\"C\\" believes anything, no matter how preposterous, as long as it fosters the belief in Flying Saucers and little grey men. Then there's Category \\"B\\", which keeps an open mind and looks at the evidence, admittedly, much of it circumstantial, and draws their conclusions from that. <br /> <br />Those in Category \\"B\\" recognize that they could be convicted of a capital crime on far less evidence than exists for UFO's. Convicted and executed. Of course, that doesn't mean UFOs actually exist. But an open mind says they might. So you have to weigh it all in the balance, and then make a judgment call when it's all said and done. <br /> <br />When I read this book, my jaw dropped that it was even published. I was convinced that the government had to have given the okay for it to be published. An ex-military man who's held a high security clearance like Corso would never submit such to a publisher without it being vetted by those in control. Those who would do so never gain that level of responsibility. And if you did, you'd better hope you look good in day-glow orange jumpsuits because you're probably going to get a long stay at Club \\"Fed\\" in Leavenworth. <br /> <br />I consider Corso a highly credible source. You just don't obtain high rank and a high security clearance and a senior post at the Pentagon if you're a drooling whack-job. Some naysayers might suggest Colonel Corso had gone potty in his old age, but if you saw the interview of him on the Cable TV show on his claims, he didn't sound like he had bats in his belfry. He sounded like he knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br />Also, I remember what quantum leaps technology was taking during the period he describes. Some say that such was the work of tireless scientists and I don't disagree. Reverse engineering of an extremely advanced technology can be difficult or impossible. But a lot of far-fetched projects are started and cancelled because the powers that be don't believe they could ever be successful.  <br /> <br />For thousands of years the scientific community did not believe that light could be bent and curved. Reflected at angles, yes, but not curved.  But if you don't believe that light can be made to turn curves, yet you have something in your hand that does just that, well, that's a horse of a different color. You might not be able to exactly reverse engineer the device, but there's many different roads to Rome. And if someone wants it bad enough, the funding won't dry up while you figure out a new way to skin a cat. <br /> <br />As Governor, Jimmy Carter saw a UFO and filed an official report. That is not a step a politician would normally take, because people who admit to seeing UFOs are roundly demonized as escaped lunatics. As President, Jimmy Carter tried to find out what the government knew, and all he got was his hat handed to him by the military.  <br /> <br />The Corso book came out when Bill Clinton was in office. There was another too, that came out while Clinton was president, titled \\"Unconventional Flying Objects\\". This from an ex-NASA scientist named Paul R. Hill. Hill went into all the mathematics as to why UFOs did not violate the laws of physics as we know them. Why is that important? Because one of the mainstays of the Category \\"A\\" types in the scientific community, is that UFOs don't follow any known laws of physics.   <br /> <br />So when I saw both of these books come out - from impeccable sources, military and NASA - I was certain that Bill Clinton was going to finally fling open the kimono on all this alien stuff. Alas, such was not to be. <br /> <br />This book reads like a career military man explaining how the US government reverse-engineered alien technology tobring a lot of scientific breakthroughs into industry. Had it been talking about German V2 rockets or Greek Fire, it would be hailed as an interesting historical text. Instead it was met by scorn from the scientific community. I suggest you read it and draw your own conclusions. Read the Hill book too. <br />
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning is definitely Green Day's best album (with American Idiot coming in a close second). Each track is great. Most certainly a must buy for any Green Day fan. Here's my review track by track: <br /> <br />1 - Warning (4.5/5 stars) Great intro to the album. <br />2 - Blood, Sex and Booze (3.5/5 stars) Not as good as some but still not bad. <br />3 - Church On Sunday (5/5 stars) One of my favorite Green Day songs ever. The best on the album <br />4 - Fashion Victim (4.5/5 stars) A must hear song. <br />5 - Castaway (4/5 stars) Another great song. <br />6 - Misery (4.5/5 stars) A very different song from Green Day. One of the best on the album though. <br />7 - Deadbeat Holiday (4/5 stars) Not much to say, great song. <br />8 - Hold On (5/5 stars) A close second for the best song on the album. Great lyrics. <br />9 - Jackass (5/5 stars) Another one of my favorite Green Day songs. <br />10 - Waiting (3/5 stars) Doesn't really stand out but still ok. <br />11 - Minority (5/5 stars) Another great song on this album. I love the beat. <br />12 - Macy's Day Parade (4.5/5) A great finish to a great album.
B0006L16N8|1.0|The \\"greatest thing since sliced bread\\"?    How is making extremely commercial music (which is actually pretty easy to do) & going through no evolution make you \\"the greatest thing since sliced bread\\" Chris?... another example of a rock stars ego becoming bigger than their popularity    Chris also said that \\"Low\\" was unlike anything they've ever done because of how fast it is.... for him to think that 'Low' qualifies as a fast song proves just how truly lame this guys musical mind is.    I believe there was one thing Chris Martin of Coldplay said that I do completely agree with    \\"We're just dogs yapping at Radioheads heels\\"    - Save your money for the new Pearl Jam album out sometime this year... a band that knows how to do sensitivity, while also keeping their balls firmly intact.
0446677450|5.0|When I discuss Robert T. Kiyosaki's methods with friends, the most controversial, if not emotional, point to arise is whether or not a home is an asset or liability. Presently, in today's market, a home is a liability. Why? In San Diego alone, %48 of the mortgages are interest only loans. This is essentially gambling with the home market and trusting that home values will increase in the same percentage points as they have in the past. Apparently no one is listening to Mr. Greenspan or Mr. Kiyosaki. <br /> <br />When I mention the house is a liability to people and jokingly say I'm gonna wait until I have five million dollars to spare to buy a house with cash, people bulk and recite numbers like, \\"but 90% of the millionaires gained their wealth through real estate\\". Well, the point is many people are counted as millionaires based on the value of properties they don't even own free and clear.  <br /> <br />This home-as-a-liability method certainly is not popular today since easy \\"wealth through real estate\\" has come to appeal to millions of people. Common sense states, if everyone's doing it, i.e. buying and selling homes in hopes of getting rich, isn't the market going to get diluted and values are going to go down? To this question, a San Diego mortgage broker responded, \\"You can't use common sense when it comes to real estate prices, you'll miss out.\\"   <br /> <br />Mr. Kiyosaki's point is don't do what everyone else is doing and think you'll get wealthy. When you think about it, \\"Buy a home now and you'll have lots of value later,\\" sounds a lot like, \\"Go to college for four years and you'll find a great paying job after you graduate.\\"  I'm glad that I read \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", it gave perspective when I thought I already had it. <br />

0316172324|5.0|When reading \\"Blink\\" it's important to keep in mind who Malcolm Gladwell is. Gladwell is a writer and reporter by trade. As such, he needs to bring things, that may otherwise get overlooked, to general public's attention. Moreover, Gladwell has to work through psychological studies that left to themselves serve as insomnia cures, but once translated into useful knowledge, have the potential to alter how people act and think. <br /> <br />\\"Blink\\" is such a translation that makes the reader question,  \\"How do I \\"know\\" what I \\"know\\"?\\"  We have, according to some numbers, over 50,000 thoughts a day. And if you are not careful about what you are thinking, in a blink, you can have 48, 500 of the same exact thoughts the next day. If you hear and see something often enough, you come to believe it. So if we follow this reasoning, if we don't filter our thoughts we'll begin to believe that same material we re-play in our head each day (regardless of whether it is true or false). This locks us in a life of mediocrity. Gladwell proposes to crack the monotony by asking a question about the very foundations of our belief and \\"knowing\\" systems. <br /> <br />Granted Maxwell's treatment and examples such as how an art expert can spot a fake sculpture in a second, and how day traders can overpower five-star generals in a two day war may seem cursory. Should he have delved deeper, Gladwell would have risked boring the readers and never attained the overarching goal of getting the masses to re-think their split-second thinking processes, judgments and decisions. <br /> <br />
B00067189O|1.0|stay away from this overhyped crap offering from sony, the 5.1 channel mix is dolby digital, no advanced resolution, not even close to dvd audio, and by the way, an inside source at sony told me they pulled the plug on sacd, so much for there hi-res format, sony is like the whiny little brat that couldnt get his way, so they release poor quality crap in hopes of hurting a format that they didnt start. lets just hope that universal stays the course and continues to offer a dvd audio layer on there releases.
B00006AFUR|3.0|Disclaimer: This album reminds me nothing of Tool. Whoever made that claim needs to have their hearing checked. <br /> <br />On one hand, knowing that this is Jared Leto, this album is impressive. <br />But aside from that, there is nothing special about this album. The lyrics themselves are shallow and basic, with *decent* vocals. Aside from \\"Capricorn\\", I can't find another song on this album that I can listen to as a whole without the lyrics ruining it for me. The album get's 3 stars from me, because the ability of the musician's themselves is surprising, but mismatched in comparison with the lyrics.

0385512104|5.0|Christopher Boone is a fifteen-year-old high-functioning autistic living in Swindon with his blue-collar Dad (his mother having apparently died) and his pet rat, Toby. Christopher is also a math near-genius, but that's largely because of his \\"unnatural\\" ability to concentrate on something to the exclusion of the rest of the world. He's frightened of crowds (too many strangers) and places he's never been before (too much new information to assimilate all at once), he's very literal about what people say, and he doesn't like things that are brown or yellow. Or his food touching on the plate, or various other imperfections that turn up in his world. He mostly recognizes his own social limitations (such as not understanding metaphors), so with the help of Siobhan, a particularly good teacher at his special school, he's developed a number of coping strategies. But this isn't to say that he's mentally deficient in any way: He has an eidetic memory back to age four, and he's been studying for his maths A-levels, fully expecting to get an \\"A\\" grade. Though his assumption that he'll someday be a scientist may be wishful thinking -- or maybe not. And many of his odd perceptions are perfectly logical, when he explains them. But you learn all these facets of Christopher's personality and the world in which he exists while he relates the mystery he has decided to solve: Who killed the neighbor's poodle with a gardening fork? His detecting leads him into discoveries of things he might be better off not knowing. And so Christopher has to be brave and undertake a journey on his own to London, he has to cope with very different people and places and situations, and even though he's frightened most of the time, he handles it all pretty well. I found it easy to empathize with this kid as I have a few borderline tics similar to his (no one in my house knows how to properly load the dishwasher but me), but I'm not sure I could do so well if I were in his situation. I also like his thoroughly objective view of the world, which is actually more accurate than that of most people. Chapters 139, 163, and 199 (in which he explains in the simplest language why believing in God is stupid) are excellent. I don't know what Haddon has in mind for his next project but I would certainly like to see a further volume in the life and adventures of Christopher Boone.ughly objective view of the world, which is actually more accurate than that of most people.

0671027387|5.0|By far I think that this is the best of all the Dan Brown books.  We follow a young woman who works as an analyst for the White House.  Her father is currently running for president and is someone whom she does not respect or like.  Meanwhile during his campaign he is bashing NASA who seems to be the fat cow of the current administration.  All of this culminates in an action adventure thriller about which you are constantly trying to figure out who is lying to whom.  A wonderful read and fully worth the slow beginning.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is the best work i've seen all my life. Literally. Batman begins gives you a different feeling with action and love. It's script is really good too and the actors in it are wonderful. The story embraces you with all the affects and it just makes you feel like this is really something. This is a MUST WATCH movie. Shame on all of you that don't like it or doesn't want to watch it!
B000001DYA|5.0|I don't there was a louder, more agressive balls to the walls band than the original Blue Cheer. When this album came out I played it so much (much to the chagrin of my parents) that I needed to replace it in two weeks. Never before or since has there been such a monster first album. Art? Not on your life but powerful. You bet. Way ahead of it's time. Recently someone gave me a copy of this & the 2nd album on CD and much to my surprise they still hold up. Played it for my son and it blew him away. It's too bad that half way through their 3rd album they made an abrupt about face and changed to a sort of country rock band whose albums weren't bad, just ordinary. The  strangest live memory that I have of Blue Cheer was at a concert where they shared the bill with Tony Benett and Sergio Mendez & Brazil 66. Oh MY!
B000002J03|3.0|I've just heard a song on 107.7 The Bone San Francisco, and it <br />was called \\"The Lemon Song\\", it was a song that I've heard on <br />the football DVD called \\"Glory Days\\". It's a good song first of <br />all. I'm just waiting to get it I guess. Then I'm gonna make <br />a football CD.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is Garbages' first CD and it's AWESOME! This CD speaks to you.. and I love it! Shirley's got a new fresh voice that hasn't been heard by any other artist out there. Garbage will be around for some time to come.. Get this CD and many more! You won't be disappointed!
B00005K3OT|4.0|<br />Chocolat is the intriguing story of a woman who brings flavor to a quiet French town.  This film \\"works\\" in a rarely beautiful way. The actors are all perfect for their parts, the acting is wonderful and the whole experience is truly magical.  The message is a bit extreme, making it appear that there is no actual need for rules, but over all it is a very enjoyable movie. It is easy to look past any flaws it may have and relish the beautiful treat that it is. Although the main character Vianne is made to seem kind and loving despite her mistakes and the church-goers cold and rude, it is still heart-warming to see the way Vianne opens her heart to each individual nomatter who they are, and the way the village is influenced for the better by her kindness. It is a great tale of how we need to treat one another, and shows how life is meant to be savored and seen for the beauty it can have.  It does almost have a fair-tale feeling to it, and I find that to be a brilliant move on the part of the makers of the film.  It is uplifting and beautiful as well as spicy and entertaining.  A true MUST SEE!!!  It is in my top five list of favorite films with good reason! <br />
0312995423|1.0|I know it's a bold statement, but it's true. This is the worst fiction book I have ever read. I really liked The DaVinci Code and Deception Point so I thought I would give some of Dan Brown's earlier books a try. Digital Fortress was the first book he published (I think) and it shows. The writing and conversations in the book are so cheesy it becomes humorous. The plot has huge holes in it and is completely unbelievable. Many of the \\"surprise\\" twists I saw coming ten miles away. It was so bad that I almost stopped reading it about halfway through. Instead I decided to \\"gut it out\\" and see how it ended. There is also probably way too much \\"love story\\" embedded in the plot to satisfy those looking for a good sci-fi thriller.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend avoiding this book.
0393324818|5.0|I ignored the hype of this book and held off reading it for over a year - I could not have been more mistaken.  The story of Billy Beane and the A's is a story of baseball's Little Engine that Could.  (I thought it was about the Yankees buying their way to the baseball title.  Whoops!) <br /> <br />Lewis takes you through Beane's background, a draft, subsequent player performance and ultimately how the A's performed.  Through it, you are presented with the history of statistics in baseball (starting with the prodigal Bill James abstract) as well as explanations for why the league is so against a data based approach.  Additionally, other attempts to apply more quantitative reason are explored, and their failures explained. <br /> <br />There are a couple public knocks on the book: <br />1 - The book is all about Billy Beane patting himself on the back.  I think this isn't valid - the picture of Beane seems very balanced. <br /> <br />2 - That Billy Beane is portrayed as a nutcase.  This is the opposite criticism of #1, but again I believe that the book is valid. <br /> <br />3 - All this baseball knowledge can't really be invalidated by math and statistics.  Actually, many fields have been overthrown by good mathematical models - quality control, finance and poker are just three. <br /> <br />4 - The statistical techniques are not properly applied.  This may have some merit.  Could Beane and friends have been making mistakes?  Is that why they're not doing as well?  Or are other teams just catching up.  The author of Freakonomics takes aim at Beane's over-reliance on hitting in his blog. <br /> <br />Desite these knocks, the book is a very interesting read for both baseball fans and people looking to apply statistical techniques to sort fact from fiction.  (Traders would be well suited to read this too!)  In a sense, this is an application of the Price Theory espoused in Freakonomics, even if the authors disagree on conclusions.  In that sense, it's about much more than baseball.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This movie is closer to a super extended video clip than an animated tale. However, this is not to say it has no appeal to either music fans or animation fans  FAR FROM IT! Using techno music from the French duo DAFT PUNK, Leiji Matsumoto builds a tale that is at once charming, rhythmic, kitsch, simplistic, touching, and just beautiful to look at. There are no dialogues other than the limited lyrics of the songs, but the vibrant colors and the magic, classic (read, old skool) look of Matsumotos designs and characters are more than enough to compensate this. In fact, this is a movie that could not work with dialogues  music is being used as the universal language here! Interstella 5555 is a refreshing spin on music videos, animation, techno house music and old skool sci-fi anime. Very recommended!
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|Having seen Zero 7 tour in 2001, I kept the name Sia Furler in my memory and bought this soon after it was released. Although different from the work she's done with them, this is a delightful, soulful album that has grown on me. Tracks, including the opener, that didn't seem to hit the mark blend into the overall feel.    The album develops an involving arc, that spans from the emotionally withdrawn 'Rewrite' to the near cathartic 'Where I belong', sharing many moments of discovery in what she's described as a very personal album. The intimacy that it develops is well maintained but does not stop the songs from varying. The charming, funny 'Sweet potato' and the almost anthemic 'Church of What's Happening Now' move the pace of the album away from predictability. It took a little while before I thought of it as a '5' but did warm to it immediately.     Her success with Zero 7 and inclusion on the keenly anticipated Six Feet Under 2 compilation suggests that her star will continue to rise, and I hope with the beauty and intimacy of this album.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|The is the best recording of T&I I heard so far.  I love Wagner's music, and when I looking for a recording, I will always tried to have native language performer, and this one provide the best combination,  Margaret Price, Ren Kollo.... <br /> <br />And who can forget the Carlos Kleiber's Der Freischtz, he is one of the best conductor in German Romantic Music. <br /> <br />With the newly remaster 3 CD set, now I don't have to swap CD between each act, and just sit down, relax and enjoying the music of mastro Wagner
B0008KLVG4|3.0|Five years ago I was so disappointed with the 25th Anniversary release on DVD that I wouldn't buy it (however a friend bought it for me as a birthday gift, so I ended up with it in possession and was mildly happy to own it). The reason I was disappointed, when so many people raved about it and considered it fantastic, was because I had the \\"20th Anniversary\\" laserdisc set, which had a documentary twice as long as the chopped-up version they stuck on the DVD, and even a more complete deleted scene selection. I rented this new 30th Anniversary to see if my suspicions were right, and found that this WAS basically everything on the LD put onto DVD; this is what they should have done five years ago! (I think that they are still missing one deleted scene, however: the short clip of Quint arriving at City Hall as the grieving parents walk out.) But they fall short of the mark by leaving out all the extras created for the 25th Anniversary edition: the production-note-style extras and the trailers--How could you leave out trailers? And instead they stick on a little nine minute featurette with the boast that it was never before seen in America. I am glad I only rented it and didn't purchase yet another release (okay, so I got the last one for free) of this classic film that deserves better. Well, Universal, close but no cigar.
B000A1EBX6|4.0|Dune still one of my fav sci-fi film and novel, this Australian release feature the 3 hours TV version of David Lynch's Dune.  Which contain roughly an hour of unseen footage.    However the film quality is quite bad, even you know you are watching a DVD release, and quality of the video and audio (sometime track appear as mono) are like from a old Video tape.  Hopfully one day we can see the clean widescreen cut of the extend version.    You can find out more information regarding to the extended 3 hour edition on [...]

I have studied extensively how the body works and how the mind works... and then to read and listen to how Dr. Bruce Lipton put the \\"missing link\\" between the two is fabulous!

I look forward to more words of wisdom from this brilliant and courageous man.
B000002UA5|4.0|This album is one of the Floyd's most complex to listen to. You have somewhat acquired taste for the studio album,but this album shows the indulgent experimental side of all the members. The live album is greatly made with some good versions. Astromoine Domaine is explosive with better guitar showcase then Barret and moving bass by Waters. Wright doesn't show much of a fight on his solo just smooth and relaxing. Careful With That Axe Eugene has some of the best guitar lines by Gilmour not the solo by him just the arpeggieated chimy chords listen to the original on Relics for better guitar work though. Masons durming is powerful.Set the Controls has got the best cresendo in the middle just building and building up to the song. Sauceful of Secerts is also a jam affair building into a little more up-tempo durm sequence and ending with the moving Cestial Voices or what ever the last part is call. The studio version is better we open with the grand opening of Sysyphus and to a classical comtemperary sounds of Wright on the piano ending with him scraping strings and rolling ball bearings across the Strings! typical avant garde like part3. Part four is a mendering organ solo with a bit of Silent Night in some places with reprises back to past one. Waters folkiness shines with the daydreamy wandering of Grandchester Meadows with a studio ending involling a fly being panned across the room with some whacking it dead. The Pict one is a wired one with Waters make animal noises by messing with the speeds on tape and ends with him in scottish accsent telling a story (god knows what). Dave Gilmour give an good Fahey impression with acostic ending with some manic slide work. Two is just a repetitive rift while part 3 has a melodelic rambling song about pasage of rites don't bother with lyrics. Mason's is with flute motif by his wife. Two is experimental with a old-school drummimg solo reprising with the flute song. Worth a listen. Sorry for poor spelling too.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is coming from a musician: <br /> <br />All in all her music is hers. Nobody else writes her Sh*t... plain and simple. This is proof of originality and gives me hope that the music that we know and love, in 20-30 years will not evolve into stories of the elderly telling bed-side tales of when there were such things as natural drum sets and real pianos and guitar riffs that weren't born on computers. <br /> <br />Although the future of music and its industries are hard for foreshadow or tell what will become of them, one woman [Alicia Keys] as well as a hand full of other musicians will work hard and truly feel the music they make and save us from these hard times. <br /> <br />She has a way of writing that no one else has. The piano melody perfectly accents and sets the mood and tone for her voice in which lyrics seem to effortlessly come from. Her songs have symmetry unlike any other artist and cultivate and prepare music for its rebirth into the future. <br /> <br />The only way you will truly know how amazing and full of life her two CD releases really are is if you buy them. Commit to her passion and you will not be let down [if you have a heart]. This is the quality of music in R and B [and everything Keys is] that i have wanted to write as far as R and B...and this is coming from a man who listens predominantly to heavy metal...I am diverse and diversity IS what you will purchase from Alicia Keys if you buy her CDs. <br /> <br />I bought her CDs because: <br /> <br />1) I respect her  <br /> <br />2)She is truly a well-rounded musician and I feel that no matter what genre of songs she writes towards they will be good, they will be hers, and they will speak unlike any other artist has spoken before her. <br /> <br /> <br />Peace all, <br /> <br /> <br />Troy
B0009NSE1K|5.0|i've been a long time clutch fan and before i got my hands on this cd i've was skeptical due to the short time between the release of \\"Blast Tyrant\\" and this one. Now if you're more of a pitchfork/impetus fan i can see how you might rate this lower. but if Jamroom, Slow Hole, and the selftitled are you favorite you will LOVE this album! it's just shuck and jive from beginning to end!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|an ominous and deeply stirring account of a man on the extreme edge of existence. The movie deals powerfully with horrifying themes of guilt and existential dread - as well as fear, loneliness and paranoia.<br /><br />Many years ago I read the monumental work, The Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoyevsky. Until now, I had never seen a modern movie that so eerily captures the deep, dark torment of the human soul.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully acted film that will challenge you, and frighten you, and ultimately leave you profoundly affected by the experience.
0345440900|5.0|While no book can be the \\"cure all\\" for every mother and child, I think this one is at least worth a try!  I got this book when my first son was just a few weeks old after I saw an interview with Tracy Hogg on TV.  She has a very loving and nuturing philosophy that worked wonders with my son...he was sleeping through the night (8 hours plus) at 6 weeks, and was taking pretty consistant, long naps by the time he was five or six months.  He is now almost four, and has never gotten up in the middle of the night unless he his sick, and always sleeps in his own bed.  I used it again with my second son...he took a little longer to warm up to it, and at first I thought it wouldn't work with his personality (which is much fiestier then my first son), but then it kicked in, and he was sleeping through the night by 8 weeks, and he also never wakes up in the night (he is now 15 months).  By contrast, I have a friend that was resistant to any kind of schedule - even the loose schedule that Tracy recommends.  As a result, she has a one year old that still gets up once or twice at night, and never sleeps more then 40 minutes at a stretch during the day...leaving both mom and baby always a little tired.  Maybe its coincidence, maybe it is genetics...or maybe it is Tracy's philosphy...we'll never know.
B0002X314C|1.0|This is Crap!  I bought it because everyone was talking about him.  I tired to listen to this CD for one week,and had to give it away.  The person i gave it to, passed it on to someone else, and they passed it on......No one i know liked this CD.  maybe his next CD will be better.  I just do like this CD. it's boring, and his singin gets to me in a bad way. So bad it makes me do the #2....what a waste of money never again, will i buy a cd because who produced it.
B0009IW98O|5.0|i just bought this yesterday at my local wal-mart, and i tell ya, when i walked around the corner and saw this on the rack.. my jaw 'bout hit the floor. i knew for the last couple, three years or so that they were going too remaster the early stuff, but was about too give up hope since it's takin' so long. great album of covers tunes done seger style. this album also has \\"heavy music\\" which was originally done and released as a single in 1967. bo diddley, the album's first track just smoke's. great arrangment with a long jam of sort's clocking in at 6:16 seconds, just a killer tune along with \\"let it rock\\" which seger did on his \\"live bullet\\" album. now with this re-release, i hope it don't take so long for the other's. why record company's have too mix up their re-releases is beyond me.. why not release them in the order they came out orginally? oh well, i guess it's better too have them then not too have them at all. can't wait for the other's. great album from a legendary artist.
B000002UVX|5.0|I find reviews for this album seem to take two sides. Love it or Hate it. Perhaps it's because this album contains the funky groove oriented Billy Cox (bass) and Buddy Miles (drums) line-up. The Experience line up leaned more towards jazz and blues.  During live sets Mitch Mitchell often pounded out double bass rhythms along with fills, fills, fills...no double bass here. This album was recorded on the last night of the 60's. By this time Jimi was using several pedals more and more to expand his sound. Particularly his fuzz face and wah-wah. Miles played drums on Electric Ladyland, and Jimi produced The Buddy Miles Express debut album.  Miles played drums with Mike Bloomfield in the Electric Flag prior to that. However, by the time Jimi played the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival in August Miles was gone and the original Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell was back in. This album is full of funk, Cox and Miles make an impressive rhythm section. Miles sings lead and background vocals on most of these tunes. His scat singing on \\"Who knows\\" provides an extra blend to the mix, basically he mimics Jimi's guitar.  \\"Machine gun\\" is a cool song with plenty of Jimi's handy work.  \\"Changes\\" is a Miles composition, with Miles singing lead. \\"Power to love\\" is a slow groove with plenty of time for all three guys to shine.  \\"Message to Love\\" is a fast rocker with classic Jimi guitar playing. Not much pedal action, just flat out finger flicking. \\"We got to live together\\" ends the album at a lightning fast tempo leaving the crowd begging for more.  Overall this album is very good. Probably one of the best live classic rock albums ever.  If you are looking for Purple Haze, Along the Watchtower, Foxey Lady, or Voodoo Child...or some \\"Hendrix greatest hits live\\" you won't find here. That doesn't mean it's a bad album by any means...However that is why some people don't like it, or the presence of the vocals of Buddy Miles practically everywhere.
0920668372|5.0|I was not expecting to become pregnant so early in my marriage, but when I found out I was having a boy, I was overjoyed, albeit a bit freaked out.  A wonderful friend of mine in Florida sent me this book and I purposely never read it until our Little Bub (nee John) was born. <br /> <br />Late one night in his first few weeks home, I pulled the book from the table in his room, and sat with Bub in the rocking chair as he fussed.  I began to read aloud and by the fifth page, I was a blubbering mess.  I read the book silently, rocking my newborn son and realizing that having someone who was going to be around forever was a wonderful thing. <br /> <br />This book is a great gift, although I am going to limit reading it to birthdays as Bub does not need to see Mummy blubber like that every night. <br /> <br />And for those that say the book is creepy... get over yourselves!  Sheesh!
B000002KIE|5.0|This is (in my opinion) the best punk album ever released, and by the best punk band (in my opinion) of all time. Unfortunatly there is less and less of this music going on today, I hope for more influential punk bands to stir up anarchy like the sex pistols did..because right now we've got whining pop-rock bands, or you can listen to rap music, which dumbs down society.
055357342X|5.0|If you're tired of good meets evil, good wins and evil is banished forever, then this is for you. <br /> <br />This series is, for lack of a better phrase, real life as it might have existed in the time. You choose your own good and you choose your own bad. Things aren't tied up neatly in a bow and presented as black and white, it is grey: life is grey. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this series highly enough; I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
0783117523|4.0|Latest Angelina Jolie's movies are nothing compared to Gia. Her performance is great. Angelina Jolie fits her role %100. This is the true story of top model. She comes from Philadelphia to New York and goes to top very quickly. Bur her personality stays same all the time. Due to drug addiction she fells down with the same speed. Her lesbian relationship is another story in the movie. Her parent's behavior is classical to all teenagers. Movie has very emotional ending. If you like to cry go ahead and cry!  <br /> <br />I strongly suggest this DVD to everybody and Angelina Jolie fans! <br />
B000006NPY|5.0|The problem is Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was so good that this album gets overlooked. After listening to it over and over again I realize how good it is. Different but good. This album deserves a lot more credit.
B0007O38F8|1.0|The first album was so hot that he couldn't back it up wit another. This album was so garbage that when I first bought it, I gave it away to a junky the same day. The production was wack, lyrics was pittyful, and the hooks were messed up. He only has three songs worth listening to. Thats Bad! And he has the nerves to diss the The Game. Don't be mad because he hot and you not. Stop cryin like Ja Rule and make good music. Who you gon dog next Banks & Buck. Slow Ya Roll buddy & rethink ya whole future. Ya feel me. Its Beezly folk!
B00000099Y|5.0|\\"They are simply carbon copies of so many other nu-metal and alternative metal acts. Some synonyms for the word \\"Tool\\":  <br />NIN, Filter, Deftones, System of a Down, Korn, Drowning Pool, Disturbed, etc...(Shall I go on? I can.)\\"  <br /> <br />I dont remember exaclty who put that, and I agree with all but  one of those.  Nine Inch Nails?  I hate to burst your bubble buddy, but NIN was on the scene before Tool.  Pretty Hate Machine was released in 1989, 3 years before Opiate in 1992.  Anyway...... <br /> <br />I absolutely love this album, it's one of my favorites that I own.  My personal favorite songs on it are Stinkfist. Forty Six & 2, and Aenema. <br />
B00030590I|5.0|Hero has me still wondering what kind of tricks it played on my definitions of hero, leader, nation, terrorist... I didn't know if I was watching a parable about a society being enslaved or set free. Like Kurosawa's Rashoman, Yimou Zhang gives us a feast of perceptions dressed in a pageant of flowing and brilliant color and characters prepared to defend their convictions.  Even if the actors are not emotive, the camera plays to their strengths.  They are wonderful in fleshing out the strong male and female characters by playing with our sympathies and sense of adventure.  No moment is wasted or prolonged.  Every movement is rich, even if it is not fighting. We are pulled up into the rafters to safety or into the saddle to ride like the wind before all is lost.  I could watch it over and over again.  As mentioned in another review, Hero has its hunks and beauties. I loved watching Jet Li, Tony Leung, and Donnie Yen like I enjoyed watching Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Kevin Kline & Kevin Costner in Silverado. Horsemen on the Roof or Hidden Fortress come closer to this movie in how beautifully it is filmed and the underlying meaning.  I miss the idea of choreography used for dance.  These days, it seems to be used exclusively for fighting (or even martial crafts for some movies).  It would be wonderful if dance could become as important again.  In the meantime, as long as a movie like Hero  or Crouching Tiger can reach even the most stubborn xenophobe, there is a place for martial arts movies. While I am complaining, it also would be great if the trailers would quit giving the endings away, too.
B0006L16N8|4.0|First off, \\"X&Y\\" is not a total rehash of \\"Rush of Blood..\\"; yet it's in no way an \\"OK Computer\\" to \\"Kid A\\" type departure. They've employed some new tricks (light electronica flourishes, new wave-ish beats, etc.), but for the most part, expect more stadium sized rockers and ballads. At this point in their career, it's what they do best.    Opener \\"Square One\\" begins with glistening atmospherics before emerging into a swirling, thunderous, anthematic rocker. It's mesmerizing and catchy; a terrific start, really.    \\"What If?\\" also starts off slow, as a gentle piano ballad (laced with strings). They've obviously developed a surefire formula, because this also explodes into a swirling, atmospheric rock-ish ballad. Not as urgent as \\"Square One\\", but even more mesmerizing and memorable! It has a subtle key change for the bridge, and this awesome \\"Day in the Life\\"-like orchestral crescendo.    Similiarily, \\"A Message\\" begins as a quiet acoustic ballad before going all U2.     \\"Fix You\\" is another soothing ballad (with Martin's beautiful falsetto, backed by church organs, piano, strings, acoustic guitar, etc.). Is he singing to a certain daughter named after a delicious fruit? Martin's singing is glorious, as is the instrumentation, making this a wonderful ballad (which again, turns more into an anthematic rocker at the end).    On \\"Talk\\", they snatch the bassline from Kraftwerk (a song which I've never heard, admittedly) and craft a wonderful song of their own. Terrific atmospheric guitar line (which serves as the song's hook, really), subtle electronica influence. Very good.    The title track is the most ambitious sounding thing on here, with some gripping chord changes, tense strings; very towering and haunting. It's the closest they'll probably get to \\"Pyramid Song\\". Total A+ for this one, perhaps my favorite Coldplay song to date.    I wrote off the first single \\"Speed of Sound\\" as a deliberate \\"Clocks\\" re-write (albeit in a different key) the first time I heard it.However, repeated listens reveal it to be a fantastic song in its own right, even if the chord progression in the verse is very similar to that of \\"Clocks\\".    \\"The Hardest Part\\" is a bit unmemorable for me, but not offensive or anything. Things pick up again with the closers \\"Twisted Logic\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\".    Other highlights include the pulsing, new wave beat of \\"White Shadows\\" (featuring more church organs!), the Interpol-ish \\"Low\\", and the delightful folk of \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" (an unlisted track).    It's not quite the pop masterpiece of \\"Rush of Blood..\\", but still excellent. Martin, while not exactly a lyrical genius, is a fine songwriter (with a spectacular voice that soars with the music), and they've crafted a surefire winner with \\"X&Y\\".     However, they will need to tweak the soft/loud formula down the road, to save from becoming stagnant. Luckily, I think they're more than capable of doing so.
0596007124|4.0|The theme \\"Design patterns\\" is very known, but I think not a lot of people know how to use them appropriately. <br />After reading this book I feel strong confidence to use all described design patterns.  <br />I did not give all 5 stars because in 2 cases (design patterns) the book was exceptionaly more talkative. Otherwise I am absolutely happy to buy and read the book. It is already my 4th book from Head First series and I have to say that all of them are very good. <br />The book is suitable not only for developers but also for architects. <br />The most valueable thing is that design patterns are explained on real examples.
0007204167|5.0|Paulo Coelhos books just get better and better, which is an amazing feat considering where he started. This book is one of the best books I have ever read as it reaches so many dimensions for the reader in it's content. Not only is it a great Novel and a touching one at that but it makes you take an indepth Journey into your own capacity for Love and what it means to you. Just as the main character in the book gets provoked by his wife to contemplate his actions in their relationship, in the greatest detail, so does Esther (the wife of the main character) manage to capture your own heart and start the search..............the search for true love.<BR>Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00001IVOR|5.0|Well I've been coming to this site for quite some time to look at people's reviews on albums I'm interested in and I was shocked to the point of disbelief when I saw that there were no reviews for what could be one of the hottest rap albums ever to hit vinyl.  <br /> <br />Though not quite as good as some of their older stuff, I was definitely not disappointed with this album. I gave it 5 stars, 5. I couldn't rate it any higher or I would have.  <br /> <br />Every track, and I mean EVERY SINGLE TRACK on Disk 1 is good. It's a disk you can throw into your jukebox and let it play through.  <br /> <br />This is not going to be a lengthy review but I'll point out some of the highlights.. <br /> <br />Reunited.. this track is nothing less than flawless. The beats are mellow and flow nice with the lyrics that are perfected by various members of the Wu-Tang Clan. \\"As High As Wu-Tang Gets\\" is also astounding in it's delivery as it delivers punchy bass that will rock your cars speakers, if you're lucky you have a sound system that will support it.  <br /> <br />Probably my favorite track on this album is \\"Heavens Sake\\" .. perfect lyrics and a beat that'll break necks. It's strong in it's lyrics and hot to the touch. If you're wearing a hair piece.. you better have that **** stiched in for this one.  <br /> <br />Overall... whether you're a black, white, chinese, puertorican, albanian, lesbian, gay, straight, pervert, stuck up, straight-edge, punk, or all of the above... if you're going to have a rap collection, you have to have this one in a sleeve.  <br /> <br />**** you if you doubt me. <br />
0975991477|1.0|This book is not science. <br />It is a matter of belief, and unsupported by facts. <br />It belongs in religion and spirituality not science. <br /> <br />A lot of books tout amazing breakthroughs by isolated so-called <br />scientists which fly in the face of known facts and solid <br />evidence of thousands of real scientists. How can these isolated <br />individuals do the miraculous and stand conventional science <br />on its head with these amazing break throughs? Well they don't. <br />They write about it, but it is not true. A lots of people <br />fall for it. Don't be one of them.
1577311523|3.0|Anyone needing to seek themselves is in need of merely looking in the mirror. Simple. <br /> <br />What you do with what you see is something entirely else; that depends on how much you rely on the interpretations that you have of yourself - and - of others.  <br /> <br />Tolle is not providing answers; if you grasp what he is on about - it is not the provision of answers that he proposes in his thoughts. If you are seeking a definitive answer to anything - then go and talk to a quantum physicist and they will set your mind straight about definitive answers. We make rough approximations; not set in concrete discoveries.  <br /> <br />Do not read any text that alludes to assisting you towards enlightenment unless you are willing to sacrifice your prejudices; and if you are  or have been schooled in the institutions of the 'Western Hemispherical Model' of education; be doubly careful.  <br /> <br />I'd suggest that if you find this book interesting, try on some of the works by Jiddu Krishnamurti or Alan Watts; they will compliment everything else that you have read and can read. We face an age where there are some severe philosophical vacuums and without a conscious return to empathy, there is indeed little hope for any life on this planet. <br /> <br />Enjoy what and when you can.
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley was one of the most creative, intelligent musicians to ever live, and his legacy is perfectly captured in this compilation. None of the classics are left out, and the songs rightfully display why Marley was the greatest reggae musician of all time.<br /><br />There lies not a single weak track. A sensational live version of the balladic No Woman, No Cry is exceptional. Could You Be Loved is a very energetic, catchy tune, and Buffalo Soldier is simply magnificent soul music. Get Up Stand Up is another highlight for me, a very expressive song. I Shot The Sheriff is immediately recognizable and is a fun tune. Redemption Song is has a great melody to it, probably my favourite here. Most people should be familiar with Jamming, a catchy melody and a wonderful upbeat feel within the song.<br /><br />A highly recommended compilation displaying the talents of an amazing musician who's music should be cherished by all lovers of music. Especially recommended to reggae listeners and also listeners of R&B and soul.
B00005JL9B|5.0|For the ones that wanted to see nudity in this movie, keep in mind that they are all 15-year-olds.  In a movie with a subject matter like this, it would be illegal. <br /> <br />Now, for the violence-fetishists, get over yourselves.  If you want nothing but violence and no plot, watch Faces Of Death.  This movie isn't for you, contrary to what the others say. <br /> <br />Now for people who have an open mind, ask yourself this question: would you kill your best friend to stay alive? <br /> <br />This will ring out throughout the whole movie indirectly.  You will be asking that in the end.  In extreme circumstances, most likely. <br /> <br />However this movie may not ever be relesed here in this country for its subject matter. <br /> <br />I got my copy at an independent CD store for about $12.  The quality is outstanding with (sometimes) bad translation.  The version I got is from a company in Korea called Starmax, and it's a 2-disc set.  The cover said it's an all-region disc, but the disc itself says region 1.  It works on mine, so most of you sould have no problem with it.  The problem I have is the second disc.  It doesn't have english subs so I couldn't watch it without understanding what it says.  But all in all, worth every dollar I spent. <br /> <br />For anyone who's into Japanese films, I suggest you get this.
B00005JM20|4.0|The \\"spy-spoof\\" sub-genre has been a regular staple in comedy films for about 40 years.  As a result, after seeing Flint, Matt Helm, Austin Powers, Cody Banks and many others too obscure to recount, it would seem that the sub-genre has nothing new to offer.  \\"Johnny English\\" is another entry into to the field, and while it may not be a particularly original spy-spoof it is still enjoyable, largely because of its excellent casting. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around an evil capitalist (is there any other kind) who is launching a master plan to take over England for a purpose too loony to reveal here.  He is played by John Malkovich doing the most over-the-top Frenchman impression since Peter Sellers.  Opposing him is Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), a bureaucrat for the English government who becomes a secret agent when all of England's other secret agents are killed.   <br /> <br />The main thrust of the film's humor comes from Atkinson's portrayal.  Johnny has no training, no talent and isn't particularly smart.  Everyone can see this, except Johnny himself.  For example, there is a running gag about Johnny being unable to effectively use his gun.  In one scene he field strips it and reassembles it, proudly holding it up to reveal he has forgotten to re-insert the trigger. <br /> <br />Despite his shortcommings, Johnny is completely unflappable, in the wondefully stereotypically-English manner that Atkinson so masterfully portrays.  As the screw-ups mount one just wants to shake our hero and scream, \\"get a clue.\\"  And still our hero glosses over his errors and carries on. <br /> <br />As another entry into the overcrowded field of spy-spoofs, \\"Johnny English\\" doesn't exactly stand out as brilliant.  Still, it is worth a rent and a watch, especially to Rowan Atkinson fans.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The title of this review basically says it all, in a nutshell.  Disc 1 is the REAL CD, as far as I'm concerned.  Disc 2 is more of a bonus disc.  It's like buying the real CD, then getting an import live CD thrown in with it.  Disc 2, the acoustic stuff, is a complete miss for me.  I can't get into it at all.  Doesn't suit Dave Grohl's voice in the least, and it's actually, extremely boring.  I don't mind though, because for my money, I got one of the best Rock CD's of the 21st centuries.<br /><br />Disc 1, the Hard Rock album, is absolutely brilliant.  It's the Foo Fighters on a new level.  The sound is more mature, and it's just a truly incredible album from start to finish.  I didn't think that the Foo's could do any better than \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\", but they might have outdone themselves on this record.<br /><br />Way to go, guys.  And, btw, is there any wonder there were no songs released from CD #2? ;)
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Dawn of the Dead box set has to be one of the coolest things ever released!  Anchor Bay has out done themselves with release.  The set comes with three different versions of the film (European, Director's Cut and the Cannae Film Festival release),  all three versions have feature length commentaries (the best one is on the European cut).  Two feature length docummentaries are also included as well.<br /><br />I have been waiting for this to come out for a long time.  The picture quality is sharp and clean, the soundtrack is cleaned up and mixed very well.  No complaints here.  Dawn of the Dead is my favorite horror film of all time.  If you're a George A. Romero mark like me then you'll want to snag a copy of this awesome D.V.D. box set.<br /><br />Highest recommendation possible.<br /><br />Land of the Dead rocks!
B00005JNEW|3.0|This is an absorbing, interesting movie.  It is about a town that is obsessed with high school football.  That sounds sick already, doesn't it.  The entire town lives vicariously through the high school football team.  What a foolish bunch of people.  Do we have people in our country who are that stupid?  Do we really have entire towns of insane morons?<br /><br />There is so little going on in these people's lives that the only worthwhile thing between the cradle and the grave is for each new crop of varsity high schoolers to win the state championship.  Hahahahahaha.  Damn.  Where is Kevorkian when we need him!  Let these morons kill themselves, do them a favor.<br /><br />Tim McGraw's character, a former HS football hero, explains to his son, a current player, that the only event in his life that has any meaning at all is the attainment of the state championship.  After that, you spend the rest of your life remembering your one event, as you sit in your coffin and wait for the next 60 years to pass.<br /><br />I hope there is a pizza shop that will deliver to the boy's coffin for the next 60 years, and bottles to pee in, since it is hardly worth getting up, now that the varsity football season is done.<br /><br />The football scenes are done well.  The coach is likeable.  The players, as people, are pathetic.  What was in their future?  One of them played for Auburn, or somewhere or other, for a year.  So at least his life wasn't a total waste.  The rest of the team sold life insurance and ordered pizza.  We need to nuke this town to do everyone in it a favor.  It would be a mercy killing.<br /><br />Come to think of it, Heaven does sound nice.  Wouldn't you like to visit Heaven this evening?  I sure would.  The only problem is I'm not sure how the tv reception is there, and I might miss the local channel broadcasting the effing high school football game.<br /><br />Does anyone really sit through those boring games?  High school players are pretty awful, if you are used to the pros.  I'd much rather watch a gifted athlete than the big klutz of a kid three blocks over.<br /><br />High school football is so bad that if I suited up and played for one of the teams I wouldn't necessarily lose the game for my team.  They really aren't that much better than me.  I would make a few decent plays in a high school game, tackle somebody, block somebody, get out of it in one piece more or less.<br /><br />The moral of this movie is that some people, in some towns, are just plain nuts.  A second moral is that our own lives, devoid of high school heroism, aren't worth living.  Just look at the poor guy who had so much athletic ability and then was injured.  Don't we feel sorry for him.  He almost lived a life worth living.  Well, maybe he enjoyed his kids as they grew up.  Pretty piss poor second prize, little consolation.<br /><br />Despite all my criticisms, which I believe are valid, this is a good movie.  I gave it three stars, and I opened my review by saying it is absorbing and interesting.  It's not my fault that some people think high school football is the most important thing in their lives.  That is a pretty moronic attitude if you really think about it.  Hey, run down the left sideline about ten steps, then fake a buttonhook and go long.fted athlete than the big klutz of a kid three blocks over.

B00005JNTZ|5.0|Nothing on TV is like this show. So thought provoking and completely addictive. This season TV came hard with heavy hitters, but the show that won my time was Veronica Mars.    Where I live we don't get the UPN network, our local CBS station does however show the UPN shows, they're just aired at 3A.M!! So I had heard about Veronica Mars, and even seen some promos, but I'm thinking that this is just CSI, but for a younger demographic. Well, I was wrong. One CRAZY sleepless night I turn on my TV. Nothing was on but this show I had heard about, Veronica Mars. After one episode I was hooked. Since I came into the show mid season I had so many questions. I began taping the show every week so I could get the next installment, and get my questions answered. There are still a few episodes I missed, but now that the DVD is coming out, I will totally be able to catch up!     I am still trying to get my friends to watch the show, but because it's on UPN, people automatically think that it's bad TV, I mean common this is the station that sanctioned a show called \\"Homeboys in Space\\". But VERONICA MARS is an \\"A\\" list show. I only wish it could get as much coverage as say Desperate Housewives, or Lost. Hopefully, VERONICA MARS has found it's audience, they're moving the show to Wednesday, and it's up against some stiff competition. Still I think it's fan base is hardcore. VERONICA lovers will follow the show anywhere, and for me at any time.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It is hard to imagine that this level of progressive music could have ever emerged from the former members of At The Drive In, but it has, and for that I am greatful... I am a diehard prog fan and this album fits the bill when it comes time for expanding my mind by listening to good music... My only complaint is that  Amazon needs to update the track listing... The first four track are the first four songs on the record, Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus, The Widow, Vial'Viaquez, and Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore, respectivly, while the remaining tracks are just random borken up sections of Cassandra Geminni... I finally got tired of listening to the disjointed sections in my iTunes player, so I took them and pieced back together as one song, like it should be, in a media editor program...  <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of my favorite albums of the last year... right up there with Mike Keneally Band's Dog and Phish's Undermind...
B00000ICN5|5.0|I will never forget the first time I heard this guy who called himself stevie ray. I remember as a little girl, I sat down next to the record player, and listened to the sound I had never heard before. His guitar playing overwelmed me as I asked my dad, who is this guy?  From that day on I was hooked. There was just something about him that made me want more. He was very unique in the way he played to the way he dressed. When he'd pick up his guitar to play, you knew that this guy was special and what you were about to hear would be amazing. I don't go a day without listening to stevie. He does something to me that I can't explain. His stage performance was amazing and he gave his all and more to the audience. He got up their wasted out of his mind sometimes and still gave an awesome show. I think when he cleaned up, thats when alot of people realized, wow, this guy can really play. If he was still alive today, I think he would be a household name. He would be as well known as jimi hendrix. But, stevie left his mark on many of us. We all miss him and we play his records over and over and over again. <3 Anyway, I got so side tracked after reading those worthless reviews about how stevie is horrible and has no talent what so ever. Texas Flood is wonderful! There are so many classics on here like pride and joy, love struck baby, lenny and my favorite testify. Stevie does an amazing job with Wham, texas flood, and dirty pool. There isn't one song I don't like on any stevie album. And that's very rare for me. I'm not kidding, this guy was amazing. He also has a very talented band behind him. Chris and  tommy are very good musicians aswell, and later reese. In addition, I also recommend all of stevie's records. Also check out jimmie, on the fabulous thunderbirds albums.           I think it's really sad when I read what people think, like bonnie for example. It's upsetting to think that people don't understand what this man is about.  And don't get to experience what so many stevie fans feel when they hear his music.       Bonnie I could care less what you think about stevie. I don't need someone to tell me what good music is, I'm a big girl and  honey this man IS talent. And that's that. This man is rare because of his talent. He's not your average guitar player, unlike the one's you listed. I'm not claiming that stevie is GOD because I already have one that I worship in church. He has more talent in his little finger than all of those peons you listed all put together have.  Something you need to remember is the ones you listed, don't play with soul.     Speed and the same chords over and over again is NOT talent, is NOT soul, and is NOT skill.
B000099T2L|1.0|This is the last CD I have bought so far, and it's the last CD I'll ever buy.  After having bought 10 CDs of contemporary music, I discovered the most shocking thing.  You may not believe this, but contemporary music is NOT the right music for me.  There may be several different genres, but I don't like ANY of them that much, believe it or not.  I much prefer older music, especially from the 1950s-'60s era, which I found out about from my mother, even though I was born much later than those years.  I will give you a review of every song on this CD, if that'll help.    <br />Crazy in Love - Can't understand anything that is said.  Sounds like Beyonce is singing in another language, in certain parts.<br />Naughty Girl - It has a nice dance rhythm, but I don't like dance rhythms.  <br />Baby Boy - This song is interesting, but not enjoyable.  I just don't like the beat, or Sean Paul's singing. <br />Hip-Hop Star - This is an ugly song.  Too much rap and not a nice melody.  <br />Be with You - The electronic music in the background is a bit too much.  <br />Me, Myself and I - Good compared to the others, but not good in itself.  <br />Yes - Too slow. <br />Signs - Ugly sounds in the background, and Missy Elliot's voice makes it even uglier.  <br />Speechless - Too much pausing, not enough flow.  <br />That's How You Like It - Cute song, but a little too jumpy for me.  <br />The Closer I Get to You - The sweetest song of all on the CD.  It's actually surprisingly good.    <br />Dangerously in Love II - No better than the one on Destiny's Child's third album, Survivor.  <br />Interlude - No comment.  <br />A Gift from Virgo - Nice title, but boring song.  <br />Daddy - I've heard better than this.
B00006HBUA|1.0|Can it get any worse than this garbage? I saw this during a Christmas get together because of all the little ones that were there. I used to like the cartoon but this movie really ruined the whole Scooby deal for me.<br /><br />The acting could be the worst in the history of movies. Prinze and Gellar have not one single acting bone in their body. Also I want to know what writer/director or whoever says \\"I have a great idea, why don't we have scooby and shaggy have a farting contest? That would be brilliant\\" What is the point of that? How does that play into the movie? My lord how movies have went literally in the toilet with all this bathroom humor. People that find this type of stuff amuzing must get a real kick every time they go to the bathroom.<br /><br />Scooby DOo is unintelligent, boring, and classless. It is by far the worst movie I've ever seen (maybe outside of \\"White Chicks\\"
B00097A5HW|4.0|Here i am...with the more accurable review of the music... <br />El disco esta bien hecho, me gusta porque no hay tantas canciones comercialonas o tan plasticas como antes. el disco es bastante escuchable y digerible. fuera de la super sonada cancion con alejandro sanz  \\"la tortura\\" que es el corte comercial del disco, hay otras muy buenas canciones. como mi favorita que es \\"un dia especial\\" que se puede notar la mano del genio Gustavo Cerati...es facil darse cuenta que el hizo mas del %75 de la cancion..suena electrica, suave, chill out, en otras palabras ..suena a Cerati. ..al igual que la cancion \\"no\\" ...las que menos me gustan son \\"el escondite ingles\\" y otra mas que no recuerdo en este momento. si te gusta el pop escuchable y no muy escandaloso ,con un toque de soft rock ...este disco debes tenerlo.  ...aparte que shakira esta mas buena que el pan!! <br /> <br />i have few things to say about this cd. it's ok, easy to listen to it. songs are catchy and well done. my favorites are \\"la pared\\", \\"no\\" and \\"un dia especial\\". this last song is feature with one of the top singers and compositor of all times...Mister Gustavo Cerati (former lead singer of soda stereo) \\"un dia especial\\" sound like if it was stolen from the albums \\"amor amarillo\\" or \\"bocanada\\"...you can hear gustavo's voice in the chorus  and some electronic touch... <br />it's a good cd... if you like pop with a touch of soft rock...this is the one! <br />
B0002ZEYYQ|4.0|I loved the album....great tunes, It felt new yet familiar. <br />great the neo-70's that Jay imprints in his tunes. <br /> <br />If you liked Jamiroquai this is album is a must. All very good quality material...Unfortunately I dont see a US top 40 hit on it...but I dont care, I have never like the mainstream anyway... <br /> <br />At least 7 /13 songs are really really good...3/13 good and the rest 3/13 just plain fill up...Heck these days if an album has 3 good songs on it is rare...Buy this one it has at least 7 awsome ones <br />
B00005JLR8|3.0|In America is loosely based on Jim Sheridan's life - Frankie was really his brother, rather than the 5-year-old boy in the movie, and the movie was dedicated to him. I bought the DVD purely after seeing the trailer on another DVD. The trailer touches something deep down inside you, and the whole film sticks with you long afterwards.<br /><br />The two girls in this (real life sisters), Christy & Ariel are absolutely outstanding for children so young, and showed some real emotion. Look out for Christy singing the Eagles song \\"Desperado\\" - you need a heart of stone if you don't find this the hardest part of the movie to watch. Little Emma & Sarah Bolger called \\"cut\\" and \\"action\\" in every scene. This was decided by the director and the girls early during filming, so that it would make the acting easier for them. Jim Sheridan captured every raw emotion that could be possibly portrayed in this, and all the actors do an excellent job.<br /><br />There are some things that stopped me giving this movie a four star rating. The fact that it's so fast paced & disjointed, and also there's no indication of how much time is passing, so you'll be watching it and suddenly it'll be a matter of months has passed, with no explanation. And also Samantha Morton - I think it's the fact that I can't stand girls with hair that short, I'm all for the girly girls with flowing locks. It doesn't make her look good in my opinion. I also found it really difficult to understand what was wrong with their originally grumpy downstairs neighbour, Mateo, played magnificently by Djimon Hounsou. I did think it was either cancer or AIDS, but it was quite difficult. Also, it's only called a \\"disease\\" throughout the movie, so it's really up to the viewers to come to their own conclusions as to what is really wrong with him. (I did think Samantha Morton's character had cancer, but she didn't.) Unfortunately, there's not much integration between Mateo & the family, and this was a major selling point of the movie, if only that part could have been extended a little. That part seemed rushed to me.<br /><br />If you're a sucker for an Irish accent, like me (I go weak at the knees), then you'll love the accents in this, since it's predominantly spoken in thick Irish accents. If you're from outside the UK, you'll probably need subtitles. You have been warned!<br /><br />Sit back & enjoy this movie but get a box of tissues for the finale of this film (there's an alternate ending on the DVD which I haven't yet watched) and Christy singing Desperado.<br /><br />Now where's that Eagles album?he movie, if only that part could have been extended a little.

B00000ICN5|5.0|Way back in 1983 my brother pulled me aside.  His voice was nearly trembling with excitement.  \\"You've GOT to hear this\\", he said, then he put on \\"Pride and Joy\\".<br /><br />Oh. My. Goodness.<br /><br />That first album was vinyl and we played the spots off of it.  When I enlisted in the Navy later that year I had to get my own copy to carry with me, on cassette.  Later, we both had to get the CD versions.<br /><br />Stevie Ray Vaughan is a musician of immeasurable talent and influence.  When \\"Texas Flood\\" was released, there hadn't been anything like it heard since Hendrix.  His tone on that old beat-up stratocaster was hot and brown.  (A brief digression on the \\"brown\\" sound - Eddie Van Halen said it was the difference between hitting a block of wood with a hammer and hitting an anvil.  If you don't get that - don't bother.)<br /><br />Texas Flood was a stunning collection of upbeat tunes and instrumentals mixed evenly with hair-raising slow blues.  SRV wired that stratocaster with cables, (seriously, his guitar gauges were ridiculously thick), then he bent those strings into tortured notes that hit your eardrum the way a bite of your momma's apple pie hits your tongue or the way Catherine Zeta Jones hits the eye.<br /><br />The title tune is a slow blues jam with Stevie's great vocals mixed in with his guitar solos scorching sound waves - at times he bends strings up TWO half-frets, choking the life out of that strat.  The previously mentioned \\"Pride and Joy\\" is more uptempo and everything good about guitar-based Blues can be heard on that track.  \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\" takes several children's nursery rhymes and puts them to the 3-chord miracle that was Double Trouble.<br /><br />I won't bother going over every track - they're all good, and if you're serious about the blues this album MUST be in your collection.<br /><br />As an aside - I see several outraged reviewers trying to rebut some idiot who wrote \\"let's face it, this guitar player is awful\\".  I'm very curious if \\"Bonnie\\" was serious - because saying SRV was awful would be to say the same about Mozart, or Shakespeare or Johnny Unitas.  They're greatness is so obvious that we're not worthy to even attempt to measure it.wful\\".

0975991477|4.0|I saw Lipton at the BEA, and is book has an appealing, if not told and retold, message...namely that our bodies, our cells, are listening. I was waiting for him to get to the part of miracles, but he never really does because he shows that none of this is really miraculous. That is, I think of miracles as supposed events where the laws of nature are suspended. Hence, I don't believe in miracles since everything can be explained or will one day be able to be explained. Lipton's book is precisely a step in that direction. Instead of leaving prayer or affirmation or positive thinking to some mysterious event, perhaps where a god is involved, he shows the biochemistry behind it. For people who couldn't acccept the spiritual idea that thoughts matter, this book shows why using the science of the body. There is no concrete steps taken in tyring to understand what thought actually is, which is something a book like GOD WITHOUT RELIGION does, but if you're intereted in how much power, for good or ill, our attitudes and thoughts can have on the body and our lives, from one scientific standpoint, this book is for you.
0060723513|1.0|I have spent two years of my life living with Australian Aboriginals, and I can tell you that this book was inauthentic from page one.  It does not accurately depict how Aboriginals talk or act.  It is a get-rich attempt to cash in on the \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" type \\"the primitives must be smarter than us\\" gravy train.  It is the worst kind of \\"noble savage\\" tripe.  At least if she had offered it as fiction, it would have been just juvenile. But to offer it as fact is simply dishonest.  Obviously she was trying to start a cult following and become a celebrity.  As a professional anthropologist, I deeply resent this kind of lying, and all of her readers should resent being lied to. If you want an authentic Aboriginal experience, rent the movie \\"Rabbit Proof Fence.\\"  No romantic claptrap there, just honest portrayals of the courage and struggles of Aboriginals, who are not supernatural beings but humans just like you and me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I didn't hear much Coldplay before this CD, so I can't say how it fares with their other stuff, but after listening to this a few times, I plan on getting their other CDs. It takes some listening before you like it, but then after a while, it's addictive. I'm pretty much hooked. It fits and work very well as an entire CD, meaning a lot of care was given to a straight through listen -- more than many other CD's I own. That's refrehing, since these are the days of programming the CD player to play whatever song from numerous discs, and perhaps some musicians give less attention to overall presentation.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I watched this wonderful movie the other night with my mother, whom has seen the stage production two times.  Not being a big opera buff I was anticipating watching a so-so movie.<br /><br />Was I wrong!!!  From the first scene to the last rose, this movie held me captivated.  I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, the singing, the set, the costumes.  I only wish that I had seen the stage production. (Who knows, maybe I can win the trip to New York).  If you are hesitating about buying or watching this movie, DON'T!  Whether you watch it with someone you love or watch it alone, you will be mesmerized and have a loving and more sensitive heart afterwards.  BRAVO to the producers, actors and anyone else involved in this movie.
