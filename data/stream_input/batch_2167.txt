B000FBFN1U|5.0|The multiple POV style is sometimes confusing sometimes as there are So Many Characters (&#34;Wait, where was she when she last appeared?&#34;) but it's effective for a story of this epic scale. Went right on to the next book!
1401937519|5.0|That book was wonderful.  I hear an interview with her and wanted to know what she learned from her NDE.  I learned a lot and don't want to give it away except this:  we are all loved by God and are connected to each other.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Mr. Martin does it again. Now in book four I've gotten to know the characters fairly well so the POV changes don't confuse me  nearly as much though occasionally I wonder where so-and-so is -- &#34;I thought he was still with so-and-so but he's not mentioned in this POV chapter....&#34; -- but other than that, the story moves quickly. The end was rather abrupt and I had to re-read the last chapter. Thank goodness I got started late on this series, as I was able to get to the next book immediately!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that Zero Dark Thirty is a captivating film from start to finish. Incredibly well done and folks who enjoy military features should certainly be watching it.<br /><br />The film does bring up several debate questions though that are clearly being discussed by many, both privately as well as in the news. 1) Was the torture portrayed with some glorification?, 2) was the information that resulted in Bin Laden's capture actually secured through such tactics? and most importantly 3)... Why did the film omit the fact that doctors and clinical psychologists were deployed to the prisons and black sites to monitor and implement these practices?<br /><br />While Zero Dark Thirty in an incredibly well made feature, one I recommend viewing if you can stomach some of the scenes, I suggest highly that IF you want to view a film that presents another perspective that might be considered by some to be highly controversial, watch for the May 7 2013 release of Martha Davis' feature documentary \\"Doctors of the Dark Side\\". It has been touring the university circuit to great acclaim and will give you a perspective on this subject that might very well raise your eyebrows.
B0019FWIEQ|3.0|Morgan Freeman is fine...John Cusack  as usually is not a very good actor.<br />Story line could have been really good but it got fumbled.  Suspend your reality to get all the way through it.<br />Not horrible...just not the best

B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Liked it but not enough to watch it over and over. It's just not that kind of story.<br />However if you don't understand our tumultuous history with Iran this one will help you get a better idea.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This has been very useful, really glad I down loaded it. I cant think of nine more words to say.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I hate this case.  The sound is distorted on both speakerphone & handset.  I couldn't wait to get to the nearest AT&T store to replace it with another Otterbox like I had previously !  I know I could have saved if I had ordered it via Amazon.com but just couldn't take the horrible sound.  Also, the touch was not as easy as before & it took a lot of effort to mute the ring when needed.<br /><br />I am much happier with my Otterbox case & all the problems have disappeared !,
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game of all times. I love it but its harder than the the first game. but I love them better than any other game made.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I'd been using a FiiO E5 for a few years, and recently picked up the E17, having been very happy with the former.<br /><br />The built-in DAC of the iMac it's connected to is already quite good, so I don't hear a big difference between that and the E17's, but it adds a convenience factor - I can quickly switch between speakers connected to the built-in DAC, and the headphones going into the E17. The USB connection is flawless - I can yank it and plug it in whenever and it's always detected quickly by OS X.<br /><br />The E5 is great as a basic amp, but works best if you're happy with the sound signature of what you have connected. The bass boost on the E5 only allows on/off - usually it's too much, sometimes too little, and rarely just right.<br /><br />I didn't get the E17 for the EQ, but it turned out to be the most useful piece. Having it lets me fine tune for just the right amount of low-end emphasis, making low-end 'phones sound much better, and helping good ones shine. The boost is really clean.<br /><br />On the Klipsch S4, the hollow mids are somewhat compensated for, and already respectable lows are much fuller.<br /><br />Pioneer HDJ-2000s do really well. The headphones' high power handling lets me really crank up the thump, turning them into bass cans like a set of tighter, more accurate Beats. Just awesome. I'm usually hesitant to tweak EQs, but I find a +6 with these is perfect for heavy tunes.
B008MEM24S|5.0|If you get this title, you'll love this app! Fun for kids and all P&amp;F fans! (Personally, I like Doof.)

0061726834|4.0|This was an interesting story, although, and I've tweeted this already, I think I would rather live in District 12 (from the Hunger Games trilogy) than live in this world where you are not allowed to feel love and to be in love and to love. We were created with love as a singular purpose to live life. So, it's intriguing to see how Lauren had us imagine this world and the people that live without love, the &#34;cured.&#34;<br /><br />It may seem silly to think that a world like that could exist, but no more sillier than what's currently happening in the world today.<br /><br />Here is a story where I don't mind having the ultimate happy ending. The fairy-tale ending. The Disney-type ending.<br /><br />Leave the angst/tragedy to Shakespeare for now. I want the princess to be able to find her prince and live happily ever after. I want to know that love is out there and available for all in the grandest sort of way possible. :)

1612191290|5.0|\\"Debt\\" is a brilliant book.  Most of the negative reviews and comments are simply absurd, pretentious, biased, and/or ill-informed.  This is a book worth reading and understanding - which takes thinking.  Other reviewers have done a good job of providing summaries, which I do not repeat here.  That said, a couple of nits: a good editor needs to go through and catch certain missing references - e.g., Perkins' \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\"; and there are others.    Also, Chapter 12 is weak.  Mostly, I think that occurs because there are fundamental changes occurring now which are not explained; but one needs the history as this book presents it to begin appreciating the nature of the changes.  Those changes include the fact that an important distinction between debt and currency was a simple function of how quickly the form of money was convertible in the past into uses - warriors needed coinage convertible now rather than debt convertible in the future, for instance, to eat or purchase other goods and services.  These days, that can be accomplished with \\"cyber money\\" - which should be differentiated from commodities, debt, and coinage.  [As an aside, some critical reviewers make reference to 'liquidity preference' as a different way to explain the phenomena Graeber describes; but that is a misnomer, as well as something which only matters when liquidity exists.  An essential point Graeber makes - which should be rather self-evident without having to say it - is that there was no liquidity per se in many situations, hence social relations were sufficient.  Indeed, social relations become the foundation of local economies that operate without coinage and with a currency predicated on trust.  But, those social relations also morph into something very different when they are perceived as debt within certain contexts - i.e., the social relations themselves are transformed.  This is obviously not a matter of liquidity preference - especially if one is no longer evenallowed the expression of 'preference' insofar as one is reduced in social status to slave or 'dead' person.  So, any reviewer referring to 'liquidity preference' obviously was not understanding the theme or purpose of Graeber's book.]    The information form of cyber money can in essence be converted rather quickly and locally into any other form - commodities, debt, or coinage.  Thus, cyber money is an evolutionary change that introduces a new set of issues - including such novel questions as high velocity currency exchange which deals in fractional differences across myriad currencies converted back into an original currency that gains value when properly arbitraged - or loses value when computer programs amplify parallel bad 'bets'.  (Marshall McLuhan would recognize these 'extensions' of money as medium - and Mumford would recognize new money as part of technics in the emerging civilization).  In the past, this would have required delays.  Now, exotic 'derivatives' create extraordinary gains and losses almost instantaneously by essentially creating 'tranches' of the 'area between the curve and the abscissa' of manufactured error terms in 'the magic' of linear equations turned into a financial calculus of chaos (albeit artificially induced, and constructed on the marvelous fiction that one can actually separate 'risk' from 'assets' to be sold as a separate tradable financial instrument).  One can act as a day-trader with debt, cash out, and go to dinner with the coinage.  That would be the 'magic' to which Graeber refers, as mentioned by Goethe.    This means that cyber currency decouples former relations of coinage to war, and debt to greater social stability (my simplification).  Or, should I say, the relations become confused and conflated - as 'derivatives' sever the social relations of debt and cloud the perception that risk always resides in reality itself.  On the other hand, I was also surprised that the role of fossil fuels (especially oil) essentiallysubstituting as \\"black gold\\" (precious minerals) in place of \\"precious metal\\" commodities was not more discussed.  Whereas, the currency was decoupled from the gold standard, pricing oil in U.S. dollars essentially meant that oil acted as the value-setting commodity.  When I worked in the Energy Information Administration, in fact, a colleague of mine pointed out at the time that the EIA models and forecasts failed to account for the fact that a stable U.S. price of oil did not mean stability in the global economy, once all currencies were floating.    When we consider that Pax Britannica and Pax Americana have both been predicated on securing fuel supplies from places beyond their national borders, coinage and debt become linked in rather unique ways to the fuel supplies for the military operations to secure the fuel supplies.  This is undergoing a different kind of radical change, illustrated by the U.S. military's preoccupation with seeking alternative energy sources so they don't overextend as happened with the lightning invasion of Iraq where troops were separated from the tankers needed to refuel.  Whereas the military used to be characterized as running on its belly (food supply), it now runs on its barrel (fuel supply).  But, it also is shifting its strategies to technical substitutes for warriors who need coinage; as with high-technology weaponry like drones procured from corporations which prefer cyber money they simultaneously arbitrage in markets for risk to profit off of both high velocity delivery vehicles and high velocity trading.  Additionally, it employs data mining and other advanced computing to the cybernation of security, surveillance, logistics, communication, etc., which are 'privatized' through government purchase.    What we need to understand is how cyber money alters the 'debt regime of global power'.  For instance, energy source can be 'programmed' into the equations for cyber money - as is done with customer-selectable supply of powerto and from utilities by green energy.  Again, this is just a personal nit, because the questions can't be properly understood, in my view, without appreciating Graeber's anthropological exploration.  Consider, for instance, how cyber money can essentially convert 'usury-free' transactions into and out of conventional interest-based transactions with computer programming that incorporates the legal assumptions of whatever local system one wants - in a manner akin to other forms of convertibility.  All this is part of the 'logics' of construction programmed into computer applications, which then can be 'interpreted' however one chooses - unless use of the computer itself is rejected.  Once in the computer, however, even the 'rounding error' of calculation becomes a profit opportunity - as in the cumulative addition of error fractions into 'ghost accounts' that can then be transferred to someone's bank account without necessarily even having committed something detectable as a 'crime'.    What remains inescapable - and not really addressed in Graeber - is Nature (versus God) as the creditor in relations of entropy as debt where the real game becomes planetary species sustainability.  There, it seems to me, cyber money has a novel use not yet explained.  I suggest further that 'syntropy' is a radically redefined concept beyond 'innovation' to transform capitalist 'growth' into cooperativist 'sustainable development' that constitutes a new moral and spiritual regime transcending entropy and other forms of debt.  What potentially makes it different is the recognition that evolutionary change is the only way forward because entropy inherently alters the possibilities of going backwards in other than decay; hence necessitating creating and organizing the fundamentally new and better.  What remains problematic, however, is the distortions of policy and polity which can continue to program the extraction of wealth from debt subordinated classes, communities, nations, and other entities - especially by failing to understand the ecological economics (or bioeconomics) of sustainability.  In place of 'debt', or what we might call in Ruth Benedict's terms 'negative cultural synergy', we need 'positive cultural synergy', or 'creative investment in the future'.  Amartya Sen's notion of 'positive' versus 'negative' freedom is relevant here.  In essence, it is a matter of human choice and design whether to produce scarcity or sustainability.  The future is Bergsonian.  Whether that is dystopian or eutopian is what the struggle is over.    BTW - there's an interesting full length YouTube film on a related topic that is fun to watch after reading \\"Debt\\" at [...]

B009VB97EY|1.0|If you are into Chippendale dancers then you might like this movie (I'm not a prude) but give me a good story (they didn't) make the actors act (They couldn't) if this movie were a ship it would be called the Titanic, it sank big time!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very enjoyable series with wonderful characters, outstanding actors, and beautiful scenery. I loved every new episode and found that once I started watching, I didn't want to quit. The estate where it is filmed is so beautiful.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I grew up watching disaster movies of the 70's, all the Airplane movies, Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Poseidon adventure etc. Seeing the upside down plane in the &#34;Flight&#34; trailer made me want to watch this movie. I felt the accident scene was realistic enough, I thought the director captured the overconfident, drug using, cocky personality of Denzel Washington's character and liked the ending which I will not spoil for you.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|ok so I only rated this a 5 because it has 3 right now and it deservves a four. this game has awesome graphics. an excellent storyline. good action and decent multiplayer. I only wish that there were more weapons selections. overall it is a good game.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have been a fan of all the Bond Films and feel that after Sean Connery Daniel Craig might just be the best Bond to have played him. Having said this I felt the opening of SkyFall reminded me of the vintage Bond films of the 60's and 70's. Pop some popcorn, turn your phones off, and enjoy the ride!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|The title says it all very fun strategy game with some bad things (can you say OVERPOWERED characters?) But the Good  things cancel out the bad things to make it a five star review.

0425252868|5.0|An incredible story of two brave men.  We Americans need to be reminded that there were men of valor, integrity and honor on both sides.  It is unfortunate that individual stories like this one tend to be overlooked in the larger story of the whole war.  &#34;A Higher Call&#34; is proof that honorable men caught up in the stresses of war need not discard their values.
B000UUF69A|5.0|Ninja Turtles are my four year old grandsons thing right now and he is thrilled with this DVD. Entertaining fun
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I gave this book four stars because I felt like the first half of the book drug on and on without anything really happening. I realize the author was dropping hints about what was to come and setting up the back story, but I still felt like it took too long. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's definitely one of those shocking and disturbing books that gets you thinking.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Yep this is Donald Fagen.  Great music, great words.  Maybe one of his best.  I do like it.  He still know how to produce great sounding recordings (I mean the audio quality).  Don't even think of an mp3 version of this.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It is great to know the battery % and recharge time. My kindle charges better with power off, so I had to change setting for this app= uncheck turn on while charging.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I loved how this series was combined into one book so when I finished one, I could easily continue right into the next book.  One con was that is was a bit cumbersome to carry around with me, but I loved the story so much I didn't mind.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series!  I have yet to find one that I have enjoyed more since.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Pretty good game. Played well on my kindle fire. It was a short game and ends abruptly. Good music and graphics.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|If you are getting this for your iPhone, you're prolly going to break it. The part where you are supposed to pull up so your phone can sit in there, seemed like it was glued. There was no directions so i pulled on it. Low and behold, it broke, and I found a little spring and clips like it was supposed to adjust. Whatever tho, it still holds in in place. Just be warned
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|The game is fun, but very challenging.  The tutorial videos do not work on my Kindle Fire, so I had to teach myself the game through trial and error.
0316224588|3.0|I was very happy when I saw that Ian Rankin was bringing back Inspector John Rebus. I have been a fan. I find that Rebus and Rankin have aged and lost their edge. The plot concerns the search for another deviant psychopath who kills young women.I personally find it tiresome to tread this well worn ground. Rebus no longer seems as if he really cares, he seems overly focused on his own mortality. He was more fun when he was in the pubs and I miss his exchanges with his former partner Siobhan. But, we must all move on as I have to Jo Nesbo. It is my hope Mr Rankin has some time to rest and bring us back the old or renewed Rebus. He is still a pleasure to read..
B00866H7SS|5.0|Though the style of writing was different to 'Fifty' I really loved the story line. Sylvia Day nailed what it's like to be in a new relationship, with all the insecurities and doubts. Gideon Cross is absolutely yummy. Can't wait for third part!
0307990818|5.0|Reading Nesbo is like reading a beautiful poem or listening to love song. He has a great talent to describe the beauty of Norway, it's seasons and its people. This writer also has an understanding of the demons in the human psyche and exercises this understanding to the maximum as he develops his intricate storyline.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the first of this series and couldn't put down this second installment. Sylvia Day develops the characters more in this part and I was hooked with the plot line that unravelled. Seems too long to wait for the third part!
0061134007|5.0|I found this book in paperback after reading The Devils Star, The Snowman,and The Leopard. In paperback, the print was a strain on my poor old eyes, and having read the sequels it was at times disconcerting knowing the eminent outcome of some of the characters. I hardily recommend Jo Nesbo for his talent to move a story and keep the reader guessing and then second guessing. Great mysteries all. I do not however recommend reading his books out of sequence as I have done for the Main man Harry Hole and his cast of associates and his Nemisis' grow and develop throughout the series.<br />It has been mentioned that his books were translated out of sequence thus the American audience is held captive to the translaters' will. Regardless. again I feel there are many great things in store for the reader and Mr Nesbo's future.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Nice and easy app to use. Love  this app making my life easier for me when I'm doing my shopping on Ebay.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|I seem to have finished the game. No end game message and level two only has like 5 mazes but I can not figure out how to get more. Was fun, now I'm just confused
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun for all ages! Only problem is sometimes the game wont load unless I restart my kindle. Other than that it's great.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I love Harlan Coben books. They are always such fun to read with more twists and turns than a roller coaster.  Great read!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! You really get your money's worth. Lots of HOs and puzzles.  Can't beat it for the price.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and hours of fun
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. I've been spending all my free time playing and trying to break my old score. I definitely give this one two thumbs up!
B00742GBDM|5.0|This is a well produced version of its type.  The thing I liked about it is that the producers emphasized the importance of the honesty and determination of the heroine to follow her heartfelt guidance as to what was good and not accept second best just for convenience or money.  She did not give in to the pressures of others, so she was not the victim of them.  How could this have been written so long ago and we are still facing the same choices today.  I guess a few simple truths of life live a long time.  Loved the movie and I even bought it so I could watch it often.
B006MPK9SU|5.0|Had many twists and turns, it wasnt easy to pick out who the killer was, it had me in suspense until the end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My friend got me into watching the show and I love it. Great subtle british writing and not too much ridiculous out of hand drama. I hate tv shows that have too much unecessary drama and just prolongs the story for no reason. If you get a chance watch Sherlock on BBC as well. Very smartly written
B006BDHAX0|5.0|The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating.  They move along at a steady pace but I never feel unable to solve.  Once I start I will try to get my time down .  I have not had any of the problems mentioned in earlier reviews so the fix worked.
B0081336FO|5.0|I rarely watch regular TV shows for a variety of reasons, but thought I'd give this a try when the kids weren't home.  LOVED IT!!  Smart, funny, intense, interesting.  Entertainment for adults without being &#34;adult entertainment.&#34;  A bit violent and titillating, yet very low on blood, gore and nudity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but whenever I leave to play another game on my kindle it restarts like I never played it before
144234430X|5.0|The level of forethought, research and preparation is obvious in 11/22/63. No unbelievable endings or liberties taken with history. King has worked very hard to weave a great fiction into detailed history. In the end, King spins a tale without any loose ends yet as a read is able to pull the reader into an edge of your seat ride into the &#34;what if&#34;.  A great work!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works great and is full screen which I liked. You also can bring up a physical mouse on screen to click which I also liked. I tried putting it on a windows 2000 server and it did not work though. So if you use it for work and have some older windows versions be warned you may be sol.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book!! Kept my attention until the end. I can't wait to see the movie, although I'm pretty sure it won't be as good as the book.
1451695195|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book.  Don't let it discourage you that it was written by a surgeon.  He's very down-to-earth and takes a good approach to the story.  He does admit that some of what he saw and felt are almost impossible to put into words, as we just don't have words to describe things of that magnitude.  I've recommended it to all my friends and family.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Did his job and refused to apologize. I respect that and think our country could use more men like Chris. RIP brother.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I have to say I was skeptical when I read the comments saying that this amp actually makes your music sound better, but now I agree completely!  It doesn't have a graphic equalizer, but from my perspective doesn't need one.  The bass-boost switch helps compensate for in-ear buds vs. larger cups, and the impedance-matching switch certainly does it's job.  I ordered the high-capacity Nokia replacement battery and it has performed very well.  I've tested with both in-ear buds, compact over-the-head phones, and large cups.  All sound outstanding.  Listened to each without the amp and then with the amp.  Even at the same volume, you can hear the difference.  I'd describe the output of the amp as crisp and clean, and with noticeably less noise than the original source.<br /><br />A couple things could stand improvement, but none were deal-breakers for me.  First, the short male-male headphone plug you would use to connect the amp to your player is too stiff.  And it's an odd length - a bit too long for some positions and a bit too short for others.  I'm looking for a sturdy but more pliable replacement.  Next, for my configurations it would be more convenient to swap the positions of the input and output so that my L-shaped headphone plugs aren't so awkwardly wrapped around the input plug.  Finally, an auto power-off function would be nice.<br /><br />The jury is still out on the analog volume control potentiometer/power switch.  It's a nice size, has a beautiful retro look, it feels solid and works very well.  You may say it's large, bulky, and in the way, but on the other hand it does sit next to the in & out jacks and your plugs are likely to be the same size, so no problem.  Others have commented on the unit being a fingerprint magnet, but I haven't found that to be a problem yet.  Overall, I'm very satisfied and feel this was worth the investment.<br /><br />My wife and I are going to Europe this summer and this baby has more than enough power for us to watch videoson the plane with no problem.
1610390938|2.0|Although the book covers some of the critical symptoms of development, the famous &#34;innovative&#34; way in addressing them remain anecdotal. Giving a name and a face to poverty might be a good resource mobilization strategy, but it impacts on the objectivity of the exercise.<br />The book is an invitation to travel into the Development World and as we all like to do when we come back from travel, is to proudly show to our friends our holidays photos and travel stories... Wonder if some crispy stories about indian street food would have added more spices to the book...<br />Nevertheless, a good book that every students who accidentally joined the international development industry should read. Who knows maybe some would realize that development is far from being the world where a romantic White Knight lives, i.e Don Quichotte...
B00821OX98|4.0|Some of it is very predictable in a fun campy sort of way, there were some suprises though..<br /><br />Characters are well done and the story moves at a great pace...watched both seasons. was not dissapointed.<br />HD was excellant and instant streaming performed well
B007REV4YI|3.0|Let me start by saying I am a 50 year old guy who has been a Bond fan since I was 8 years old.<br />My first exposure with Bond was going to see YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE in the theater with my dad in the late 60s<br />(back then in small towns, they would often play replay movies 2-3 years after original release)<br /><br />Later in my teens and college years, I collected and read all the original Ian Fleming novels.<br /><br />Even today, if I have to take a long road trip, I will listen to an audiobook of James Bond read by Simon Vance.<br /><br />I prefer the more serious Bonds of the early Connery years over the Roger Moore films of the 70s<br />It is not Roger Moore's fault ...... the 70s was simply a time period in America where post-Vietnam, Hollywood made many movies \\"campy\\" to try and lift the nation's spirits.<br /><br />I think George Lazenby did a good job in OHMSS and I like the serious tone they brought back to the series with Timothy Dalton.<br /><br />I think CASINO ROYALE is possibly the best movie in the series.<br />Despite physically looking nothing like Ian Fleming's Bond, Daniel Craig is a great actor who portrays a serious gritty Bond very well.<br /><br />I think it is no coincidence that CASINO ROYALE follows the Ian Fleming novel closer than any other film in the franchise and also happens to be one of the best (or the best) movies in the series.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace was pretty flat and not inspired.<br /><br />That brings us to SKYFALL .......<br /><br />(warning - there might be some minor spoilers below) ...........<br /><br />I think the success of SKYFALL is largely due to a massive marketing effort timed to coordinate with Bond's 50 years in cinema.<br /><br />On it's own .... I don't feel it lives up to the excitement and high praise.<br />It is nowhere close to being as good as CASINO ROYALE.<br /><br />Point by point ------------<br /><br />1) You must totally suspend logic with this story.<br />We have a villain bent on revenge who claims he was \\"planning this for years\\".<br />So we must believe that he was able to plan down to the exact second when he would be captured, when they would try to crack his computer code, when he would break free, who would be assigned to chase him, where trains and cars would be at precise times and even where people would be standing months in advance for all his elaborate plans to work as they did on the screen.<br />B.S.<br />So it makes him seem omnipotent, but actually it it TOTALLY unrealistic and silly.<br /><br />2) They made a big deal out of this Bond villain being the most menacing of them all.<br />No way ........... this main bad guy was a goofy comical character.<br />Imagine Batman's Joker if he was a total over the top \\"flamer\\" from a Key West Gay Pride Parade.<br />This is no Le'Chiffre or Goldfinger<br />This is a wimpy, weak and totally boring Bond bad guy.<br />No menace at all.<br /><br />3) Time Continuity means nothing in this \\"parallel universe' of Bond.<br />This bothered many people I spoke with.<br />In Casino Royale, they essntially re-booted the series with a young Bond only recently getting his<br />\\"OO\\" license.<br />Vesper helped him mold his trademark image of dress and drink and class.<br /><br />Now only 2 movies later, he is burned out, tired and worn out after \\"too many\\" years on the job.<br />He has a crew cut and looks to be 51-53 years old.<br />However they use this film to introduce \\"new\\" characters that are part of Bond's full career.<br />HUH ??<br />It makes me wonder where they will go with the next film -- or is time totally irrelevant in this new Bond universe.<br />He is young and new to the job in CASINO ROYALE -------- he is old and almost ready to retire in SKYFALL<br />I guess we must take each movie to be a stand lone time irrelevant story from now on.<br /><br />4) Many of the individual scenes are well done and powerful -------- but as a whole, the film has the feeling of 3-4 disjointed scripts forced to work together.<br />I always say a really good movie makes you forget for a few seconds that it is make believe -- you almost forget you are watching a movie.<br />But SKYFALL just looks and feels like a cast of actors on site filming a movie and doing their job.<br />Whatever that \\"magic\\" ingredient that makes a movie seem like it is real is missing here.<br /><br />5) BLU-RAY does nothing for this movie.<br />The DVD and BLU-RAY look virtually identical.<br />This is probably because 80% of the movie is either shot in...<br />  a) cloudy rain<br />  b) dark night time<br />  c) with heavy blue filters<br /><br />As techs may know, digital film and photo has a hard time dealing with black balance.<br />That is why dark movies on DVD and Blu-Ray are often \\"grainy\\"<br /><br />In order to take advantage of true 1080p HD video quality, you need good lighting<br /><br />That is why sports events and nature shows in HD are usually used to demonstrate HD TV in stores.<br />The brightly lit, vivid colors with high saturation really benefit from HD or Blu-Ray quality.<br /><br />But dimly lit, grey, dark blue or black video will look almost the same in Blu-Ray or DVD since it is too dark to take advantage of the enhanced video resolution.<br /><br />SUMMARY -<br /><br />Skyfall is \\"OK\\".<br />It was entertaining to sit thru, but it is not a Bond movie I see myself watching very often.<br />I feel it sold so well due more to mega-marketing and the \\"50 Years of Bond\\" nostalgia, than it being a super masterpiece.<br /><br />I feel SKYALL is much better than QUANTUM OF SOLACE -------------- but, I feel it is far weaker than the excellent CASINO ROYALE.o work

B004KBSQBA|5.0|In my experience of music, there are very few albums I can consider to match up with the musicianship displayed in Graceland.  It stands apart in so many ways, and I encourage everyone to buy it.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Both of my adult kids have kindles, which they love, and they both needed covers. This one was an extra, last minute find and ended up being the best of the bunch.<br /><br />This cover is flat out beautiful. It reminds me of those leather books you sometimes see in libraries or collections. Of course there is no gold leaf title on the spine, since the amazing kindle carries entire libraries of materials. Still, it looks completely like a book, so it also looks great when you slip your kindle onto a book shelf. The elastic on the inside is a bit snug and it makes it hard to initially get the kindle into the cover. I guess it is probably designed that way because it holds the kindle snuggly in place, but the elastic is quite hard to work with. Still, it is not just beautiful, but sturdy.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, only to find that he had already read it a few weeks before. His Mom praised the book and suggested that I channel it to someone else. I read it, loved it, passed it on to a friend who loved it and is giving it to her niece. Also recommended it to a teacher who loved it and is now having it introduced in his school. Teaches empathy in a non-preachy, realistic way.
B001HC8516|5.0|I found it pleasurable to read a book when both a man and a woman share opposite thoughts about relationships. This book was very well written and I enjoyed how &#34;Greg&#34; gave hard facts about how and why men think and act the way they do when it comes to a relationship. On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed how &#34;Liz&#34; counter acted with her comments on the same subjects. I understood both sides of the issues because it came from a man and a woman with life experiences that many of us can relate to. I really enjoyed the &#34;exercises&#34; at the end of each chapter, as well as, the summarizations after each chapter. There was one issue that I still can't comprehend, and it was the one about a woman approaching a man or making the first move. Liz's statement about this subject was right on target from a woman's perspective, however, I found that I  respected Greg's insight in that he's a man. A very, very good book. Women should grab a copy of this book and get in on the discussion! Excellent reading!
0439023491|5.0|I had to buy the 3 books and when this came out I really wanted my own copy. Have seen it twice and still good.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|I enjoyed this version. I've played all the Silent Hills and the one seems to touch on the game more then the others. It was entertaining but also rather corny. Her being the little girl or the little girl letting her out blah blah blah corney. They just put loads of make up on her face to be her evil side. That I felt was dumb. But everything else was ok

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Erin paints a gorgeous picture for your senses! Hope they make a movie from this book but it probably won't be able to do it justice.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I convinced my husband to watch this and we LOVE horror movies and this movie was so worth it!!  Its so disturbing and unsettling and even a little hokey (I didn't buy the kids in the movie running around)  But every thing else was awesomely scary!!

B00001OH7Y|4.0|I loved this album when it came out in 1980 on vinyl. It's nice to finally have on CD. I consider it the last great Bowie album. Some might say 'Let's Dance' (1983) & 'Tonight' (1984) might be included as great, but I found them a lot more pop/dance orientated. I'll probably get them in time on CD also though. &#34;Scary Monsters&#34; has a real rock heart too it.<br /><br />Aside from Tom Verlaine's &#34;Kingdom Come&#34;, all tracks were written by Bowie. It's noteworthy to mention that Pete Townshend plays guitar on &#34;Because You're Young&#34;.  I love the bookends of &#34;It's No Game (Part 1)&#34;  and (Part 2). It is one of those album that should be listened to from start to finish in one sitting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|All you need to enjoy this is a love of wordplay and a taste for involuted plots stitched around the dull opulence of Britain's idle rich.<br /><br />Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast. Laurie's Bertie Wooster is dim but vigorous and good-hearted, while Fry's real-life erudition reflects well in the knowing and subtle mastermind valet. Writer Clive Exton's adaptations of Wodehouse make a winning formula out of Bertie's inadvertent betrothals, scheming amongst family and colleagues, and endlessly plumbable nonsense from the upper-class twits filling Bertie's beloved Drones Club bachelor's retreat in London. High points include a banjo orchestra run afoul of a local holiday, England's would-be Duce, and a surprisingly moving pastoral homage to Ralph Vaughan Williams.<br /><br />As these things go, Jeeves & Wooster suffers a gradual loss of focus on repartee and narrative in the third season, then a sharp dropoff from the start of its fourth and last. In spite of the same writer and actors, and carryover director from Season 3, it's as if they simply ran out of Wodehouse.<br /><br />Snapping that end off still leaves us with a terrific series.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Super entertaining!  Great fusion of several genres of music all in one compilation. Definitely one of my favorite albums of theirs!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Loved the 'costumes' for the birds - i'm only through half of the first planet - I have no idea if the Hoth planet works now (as it was a problem on previous reviews) but I love the game anyways.
B007NU54H4|5.0|I love all the Tinkerbell movies and this is no exception. A very sweet story and I love that it takes place in the winter woods, a place that has not yet been explored.

B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek manages to capture, in a relatively short writing, some excellent truths about running, eating, and life in general.  At times humble, at times self-deprecating, Jurek nonetheless shows some of why he has come to be regarded as one of the greatest ultra-runners on the planet.  I would recommend this to any runner of any distance.

1400052181|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the history of HeLa and Henrietta Lacks.  I thought the content was very interesting and informative and I liked the way the author interwove the science with the family history.  It probably could have used some tighter editing and more review before the book was published which is the only reason why I downgraded it from 5 stars to 4 stars.

0385344228|5.0|I found this book to be engrossing because of the premise of the book.  What if your son was charged with a terrible crime?  Worse than that, what if you stopped believing in his innocence?  I felt that the author did a wonderful job of weaving the story together.  I liked the fact that the author also chose to show Jacob as flawed but not overly flawed so you kept wondering if he really was capable of the crime.  Highly recommend.
B008ENA74E|5.0|I enjoyed the 'straight talk' way Greg Smith walks you through the corridors of wall street. It is an easy read of a very complex industry. He also confirms why I have lost faith in the financial industry - they are a bunch of parasites who have no other use in the world other than to make commissions off of other people's money.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Very addicting game. Like that playground runs when off too.  Would  be better if expansions were less !  Screen a Little crowded.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first book by Nicholas Sharks but it will not be my last. Very will written, it keep my interest with a little added thriller. I would recommend this book for anyone.
034580404X|1.0|I was expecting to enjoy this ('nuff said), but had to force myself to finish the trilogy.  The writing reminds me of bad Harlequin novels, with lots of breathless, gushy narrative.  It left me wondering whether the author had ever heard of a thesaurus, as the same small group of adjectives were used (over-used, misused) again and again.  Definitely not up to the writing level I'm used to.<br /><br />There is also a great deal of controversy over these books in the, ah, &#34;community&#34;, so be warned:  some tops may be the way they are due to abuse in childhood, but by no means does this apply to all of them.

B00AJLHUYO|5.0|This movie was great, one of the scariest movies I've seen in awile.  I've seen alot of horror movies and I don't get scared easily, but this one got to me a little bit.  From the beginning, to the music and the old video footage.  From the man with the face paint, to the kids showing up dead.  This one is a must see, but if you scare easily you may want to avoid it.  Or at least be ready!

B009I2UH2W|4.0|I wish the cord was a bit longer.<br />The unit works great, the Apple Lightning connector fits my i-phone 5 even with the case on, but in the car (duh) the cord pulls the phone off the seat. I wish it was 6\\" longer, but I'd buy it again.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My grandson and I have lots of fun with this game. He had me play with him so much at Christmas until  I finally had to hide the game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The topic that Dr. Alexander writes about is facsinating and has changed my outlook on death.  The fact that he is a very intelligent and qualified man, able to speak about the brain makes his story remarkable.  I loved the way he explained many parts of his journey, and I must admit some of his technical explanations were hard for me to grasp.  But I felt he was compelled to tell others what happened to him.  He tried to explain the unexplainable as best as he could.  I believe that understanding his concepts have changed my life for the better, and I'm very happy to have read his book.
B007NVIB5U|1.0|Couldn't get past the first episode--WAY too much sex and lack of morals.  I guess if that's your thing, but not mine...
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Reading this book was uncomfortable at times.  But the overwhelming feeling that Jaycee is a remarkable woman will stay with me forever.  It's beyond belief that she survived some of the most horrendous examples of what humans do to each other.  I have often had her cross my mind when things might go a bit wrong, and I get strength in thinking that my troubles are nothing compared to others. The book is well written and an easy read.  I encourage anyone to read it, from young women to old, it makes me proud to be a member of her sex.

B00A8KJN14|5.0|There’s been a lot of chatter over the last decade or so (at least since his Planet of the Apes remake) claiming that Tim Burton is washed up, out of the game, finito.  For a long time it was easy to dismiss these naysayers as nostalgia worshipers, people who hold their childhood experiences so close to their own hearts that nothing can compare to the movies they loved at age thirteen.  On the one hand, this chorus of doubters conveniently ignores the fact that during Burton’s supposed period of decline he somehow managed to direct Big Fish and Sweeny Todd, two of his absolute best films that pull Burton’s bag of tricks into new territories.  But after the dual duds of Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows it has become increasingly difficult to ignore these doubters.  Where Dark Shadows was inoffensively mediocre, Alice in Wonderland stands as perhaps Burton’s worse film and yet simultaneously his most successful at the box office (Adam Smith you have failed us).<br /><br />Frankenweenie, which is based on a live action short film Burton directed while working for Disney, could have gone one of two ways: it could have drawn an unflattering comparison between the Burton of old and the Burton of the new millennium, or it could have showcased a talented director going back to the well and delivering up some of his old magic.  I’m happy to say that Frankenweenie is much more the latter than the former.  Unlike Planet of the Apes or Alice in Wonderland, which felt like a Burtonesque paint job was hastily plastered onto someone else’s movie, Frankenweenie is a wonderful encapsulation of Tim Burton’s obsessions with surprisingly little regard to audience reception.  Like the best family films, Frankenweenie brazenly straddles the line between heartwarming and offensive.<br /><br />At its core Frankenweenie is a basic retelling of Mary Shelley’s classic monster tale with the mad scientist of Switzerland switched out for a bunch of suburban kids.  The main character is even named Victor Frankenstein in one of several subtle and not so subtle allusions to classic monster movies.  But Burton is far less interested in gothic literature of the 19th century than he is in b-movies of the mid-20th century.  In typical Burton fashion, Victor is an awkward outcast who has a love of science but no real friends except for his dog, Sparky.  When Sparky one day gets loose from his leash and gets hit by a car, Victor is naturally despondent.  But after a lesson by his equally strange science teacher, Mr. Rzykruski, on the affects of electricity on dead animals, Victor decides to resurrect his beloved dog.<br /><br />Much of Frankenweenie plays out like Tim Burton’s love letter to Tim Burton.  It feels almost as if he too is performing a type of conjuring act, resurrecting his old self for one more film.  The movie is a loving assemblage of b-movie tropes and allusions, from analog mad scientists to Japanese kaiju.  A good number of the references will likely go over the heads of the younger set.  And the dark humor Burton and his team find in the concept of a walking, rotting corpse often comes across as a lighter version of Cronenberg’s body horror.  But these choices are refreshing because they show us that Burton is making this film largely for an audience of one: himself.  Perhaps the most audacious creative choice was the fact that the movie is filmed in black and white.  It’s difficult enough to release a film for adults in black and white anymore, much less one that’s ostensibly a family film.<br /><br />But of all the movie’s characters, the one that interested me the most was Mr. Rzykruski, voiced by Martin Landau who previously turned in one of the best performances of his career in another Tim Burton joint, Ed Wood.  I often have a problem with Hollywood’s depiction of teachers in films.  Too often they come across as self-help gurus (see Dead Poets Society) or they are tasked with saving inner city youth (seeDangerous Minds).  Rarely are films interested in teachers who, you know, actually teach their subject.  We only see Mr. Rzykruski a few times, but judging by his classroom demeanor, he is interested in little more than showing his class how the world works.  There are no gimmicks.  For him, science should be interesting enough.  Later in the film, the parents come together in a meeting to denounce what he is teaching in their school and demand that he resign.  Rzykruski takes this opportunity not to defend himself, but to in insult the parents and condemn them for being so ignorant.<br /><br />This scene is in-keeping with Burton’s distrust of the public.  Think of the moment in Edward Scissorhands when the community starts turning on Edward or how easily the Penguin manipulates the people of Gotham in Batman Returns.  In Burton’s world, the public is always one little push away from becoming an ignorant mob.  This depiction of a teacher who stands up to the parents of his pupils is also refreshing in a culture that has decided to lay all of society’s problems at the feet of public school teachers (see Won’t Back Down).  If only teachers would listen to politicians and meet the demands of largely arbitrary testing criteria, then all of our economic and social ills would be solved.  But here Frankenweenie clearly tells the parents to get out of the way of teachers and let them actually teach.<br /><br />For anyone who has pined for the Tim Burton of old, then Frankenweenie should be refreshing.  Most children’s movies provide rather routine pabulum as life lessons.  Similar to The Nightmare before Christmas, a film that was about failing at your life goals, Frankenweenie doesn’t trade in easy lessons.  Perhaps the movie’s message could be best summed up by Victor’s father who tells his son, “Sometimes adults don’t know what they’re talking about.”  I think we can all agree that this is both an unconventional message in a children’s movie and that as a statement it is largely true.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It should have the graphics fixed but it is really fun and easy you should get it the character's are cool too it is a good game.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so awesome. It is great for all ages it like teaches you how to take care of a horse
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|This series is an innovative take on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson--and has some surprising story lines. My only complaint is that some of the weeks, I do think the subject matter got too gruesome.
1451683405|5.0|Great book. At times, we all need a guide to bring us back into rational thought, reasonable thinking, and critical analysis of the information that floods us from the news media.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Excellent casting and great performances.  Engaging storyline.  Engrossing adult themes which totally eclipse the childish pablum on regular Network television.
B002C949KE|5.0|good analysis of critical thought. Helps me consider carefully anything I see on television, internet, or books. Always pause to consider.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Very complex and engaging story line with some unexected twists.  Great performances by the cast and wonderful cinematography.<br />What television for the intelligent mind was meant to be.
B005FNJL7K|5.0|I bought this for my husband's bday because he loves this movie's soundtrack and the reviews here were very good. We were amazed at how well it plays, seamlessly like one piece. We have enjoyed it very much, I highly recommend it!
B00633W614|5.0|This is a really great book.  I love stories that span generations and this book is simply the beginning of the story of Harry Clifton so I have more books in this series to look forward to.  The story kept my interest, the characters are real and you either love them or hate them.  The author has a way of bringing them to life for you.  I am reading the second book in the series now and it is every bit as good.  You won't regret buying this one but I would plan to read the entire series or don't bother with this just one...just my opinion.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|This does work for my Nexus 4, better than Miracast to my surprise.  The Audio and Video do work through my sound system on the tv, and forces my Nexus 4 in Landscape whenever possible which is nice.  As far as charging my phone, I need a wireless charger, because it does take up the slot where I would hook up a micro usb.  Battery drain is not uncommon from this, but a 1 amp wireless charger will at least lessen this.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Easily synced with my iPhone 4S.<br />Can make and receive calls effortlessly with a push of button.<br />Activates as soon as I enter the car.<br />Can use Siri to send and receive text messages orally.<br />Great battery life, too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I rated it 5 stars because it is my favorite classic. I love this book, because the book is inspiring kids to live their lives. I'd recommend this book to people who love classics.
0393307050|5.0|It takes some getting used to the dialogue, but after my 3rd time through the entire series I'm still picking up nuances of humor and the character's personalities. These are amazing books in their detail about life in the 1800s not only aboard one of Her Majesty's frigates but the proper interactions among men and women. When men were all armed and ready to fight a duel over the slightest insult, attention to courtesy was paramount!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really don't know what it is like. The only one I have is xbox 360 edition please tell me what it is like.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As usual, Susan Boyle does not disappoint.  This CD has some of my favorite songs, and her voice is like a songbird.  Beautiful album.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Not your typical bad boy, good girl love story.  Two individuals that are exact opposites, yet they come together seamlessly--and with a twist!  I really enjoyed Hoovers way of writing, she kept me interested.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 is a fabulous continuation of this story of an aristocratic British family.  I have enjoyed every minute of this series and can't wait for season 4, which is being filmed now.
B005544V6A|5.0|The character relationship of Mike and Harvey is smooth. It is entertaining and the storyline is good. I love especially when they use one liners from classic movie.
B00005JKDR|2.0|I was pleased with the short amount of time it took for the movie to arrive but when it arrived the movie case was cracked
B000M5AJQI|5.0|I received the movie on time (no problems or issues ) and the quality is great. I would recommend this movie.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|excellent which can make this processor is definitely a beast has incredible exceptional performance is the only thing that gets very hot under full load with the ventilation air but the rest is excellently good
B004DMIIOG|5.0|One of my favorite movies, i was happy as a little kid when i finally received it on time. I started watching it and the quality was good.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I didn't get to watch this series when it aired, but I've enjoyed all the episodes as I've watched them on my Kindle this Winter.  Outstanding costumes and acting.  Now I want to know more history surrounding this king and his life.
1583334386|5.0|simple to read and understand and she comes across as real, not a know it all egg head like a lot of profs.  Easy to do the cases and apply what I read
B0038P59A0|5.0|Loved this movie.  Love Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law.  Screenplay was well written.  The story line had twists and turns that commanded your attention.  Some movies drag on and you wonder when they will end but not so with this one.  Well worth seeing more than once so I now own it.
1400069289|3.0|way to much bull and back and forth on non important things. I would not recommend this book but waste your money if you want====
1439580162|5.0|The Code Book is so much fun, it's hard to put down. Not only have I learned about coding in history, I've been able to use the techniques to develop my own codes. I encrypted a birthday message for my dad and, even though he's great at cryptograms, the message took a little longer for him to decode as he learned to decrypt documents containing no spaces or punctuation via the frequency techniques. So much fun! Thank you!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I really like this book. I can't even explain why. It's quite the downer and the characters make you frustrated, but I LOVE it. You really feel what the characters feel. You get frustrated for them. You pull for them when you really shouldn't. You want it to work out for them even though you know it's impossible. It's a love story without a happy ending, but also a twisted happy ending at the same time. Twisted is a good way to describe a lot of this book. But I loved it with all it's twistiness.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The acting is superb and the subject matter is handled with compassion, humor and without making it seem like we are looking in from a sense of feeling &#34;sorry&#34;. The actors gave just the right tone of bringing their characters with realism.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I chose this rating because I read the book & now saw the dvd. I am glad that I can watch it whenever I want to
B00BESKTMG|4.0|Quentin once again shows that he's all about the action. This movie has a lot of action in it but surely an R rating. It's not for the weak in heart or stomach but once again plenty of action. I like the setting and time frame in history..., the theme is good. The wild wild east is just a good as the wild wild west and Russell Crowe was great.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book has its ups and downs but I would recommend it to 4th grader book to a 7th grader book it is da bomb
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Once again Denzel nailed the role. I like the way the movie portrayed him as one of the best at what he does. The movie is a good example of what drugs can do to a person and why it's not an option to use. This is great in every movie he acts in.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|One of the better shows to come along in the last ten to fifteen years. Can't wait to watch them all
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Excellent book, and it has a very interesting and new theory. It's also not a dry text book type of read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have to say I'm so picky about what I watch, especially if it's fictional, but Supernatural is truly amazing, captivating, funny, sad, scary, dark, yet light, full of emotions, and at the same time, full of information. I've been a Paranormal Investigator for years, and have been to some pretty dark places, but had awesome experiences. So I guess you could say &#34;The Dark Side&#34; does intrigue me, but this series covers it all! Sam and Dean have such chemistry, and then when you add Bobby and Castiel........It's just priceless! I'm buying the entire set just to have it! I don't do that too often!
B009ZE27US|3.0|All this thing does is make you put your finger on the mark and then picks a random number. The ages they pick are usually in the 40s
B0060AY85C|3.0|If you loved The Bluest Eye and Song of Solomon you will enjoy Home. A sad story with a redemptive end that shows sometimes you can go Home again, and in the process discover it for the first time. Frank and Cee are characters who will live on I. Your heart long after this very short book is finished.
0316044695|3.0|Hopefully it will be a good read, I will re-reveiw it once I've finished. Seals are generally to over rated anyway. There great don't get me wrong but we'll see after the read. I'm sure it'll be a movie!!!!!!
B004J80CH0|4.0|Ms. Boucher is an incredible artist/musician that shatters the boundary of Electronica as a male dominated genre. With 'Halfaxa' I found the nucleus of what would later become her masterpiece, Visions. Candidly, I found her vocal styling to be a bit cloying, but, it was on persistent and repeat listens to her music that I came to love her artistic statement and versatility as a musician. This is the type of music that is best enjoyed by those thrilled by the beauty of electronic sound, the studio as an instrument and experimental song writing. I truly am excited about what lies ahead from Grimes. It's the majesty of artistic endeavor that compels me to keep a close ear to this work and its successors.
0062082353|3.0|Added to my collection. I haven't had time to read it yet, I will review it again once it is read.
B006K70A66|5.0|Certainly one of my top ten picks given the superb craftsmanship in recording, song craft and musicianship. Filled with gorgeous ambient electronic embellishments, and richly ethereal female vocals... it's the overall atmospheric nature of this record that keeps it so dear to me after all these years! A brilliant example of how visionary the 4AD label had boldly asserted in the 80s.
0525953728|5.0|Private library collection. The book is great and tells a super story about the men behind the scenes. If you haven't read it please do.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great story, great acting and suspense. Sam Neil is terrific as the ruthless Cardinal Woolsey. This is a must see series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an “amazing” book. Gillian Flynn proves she is a master at understanding how relationships work – the subtleties and nuances and shifting perspectives and multi-layered power plays that are usually inherent in any long-term relationship or marriage. The mystery is good, yes, but the psychology is better; it is outstanding. This book is worth reading purely for its insights into complicated human relationships – the kind that onlookers and outsiders may not understand.<br /><br />Excerpts as examples:<br />1) “Because isn’t that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn’t that the simple magic phrase? So you suffer through the night with the perfect-on-paper man – the stutter of jokes misunderstood, the witty remarks lobbed and missed. Or maybe he understands that you’ve made a witty remark but, unsure of what to do with it, he holds it in his hand like some bit of conversational phlegm he will wipe away later. You spend another hour trying to find each other, to recognize each other, and you drink a little too much and try a little too hard. And you go home to a cold bed and think, That was fine. And your life is a long line of fine.<br /><br />“And then you run into Nick Dunne on Seventh Avenue as you’re buying diced cantaloupe, and pow, you are known, you are recognized, the both of you. You both find the exact same things worth remembering…You have the same rhythm. Click. You just know each other. All of a sudden you see reading in bed and waffles on Sunday and laughing at nothing and his mouth on yours. And it’s so far beyond fine that you know you can never go back to fine. That fast. You think: Oh, here is the rest of my life. It’s finally arrived.”<br /><br />2) “Nick is old-fashioned, he needs his freedom, he doesn’t like to explain himself. He’ll know he has plans with the guys for a week, and he’ll still wait until an hour before the poker game to tell me nonchalantly, ‘Hey, so I thought I’d join the guys for poker tonight, if that’s okay with you,’ and leave me to be the bad guy if I’ve made other plans. You don’t ever want to be the wife who keeps her husband from playing poker – you don’t want to be the shrew with the hair curlers and the rolling pin. So you swallow your disappointment and say okay.”<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br />3) “I’d already pictured myself with a regular woman – a sweet, normal girl next door – and I’d already pictured telling this regular woman the story of Amy, the lengths she had gone to – to punish me and to return to me…Amy was toxic, yet I couldn’t imagine a world without her entirely. Who would I be with Amy just gone? There were no options that interested me anymore.”to tell me nonchalantly, ‘Hey, so I thought I’d join the guys for poker tonight, if that’s okay with you,’ and leave me to be the bad guy if I’ve made other plans. You don’t ever want to be the wife who keeps her husband from playing poker – you don’t want to be the shrew with the hair curlers and the rolling pin.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is filled with love, angst, frustration and passion. Kudos to Ms. McGuire for writing about a love that can truly conquer all. I can't wait for Travis's POV, coming out in April 2013.
B00571F26Y|5.0|one of my 3 favorate books i have gone wheat free for one week and already feel a lot better my ADHD is going a way and i have more energy

B000PDYVVG|5.0|I have not put it down since I started this book. I can't believe I did not read this sooner.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations. It is a wonderful, clean comedy with amazing music! I don't recommend it for folks under the age of 16 though.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I enjoy playing MahJong and when I can not be hooked up to WiFi it will be a good fit.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's key touched my heart in unspeakable ways. Sarah is a very lovable young girl whose life has been altered by excruciating horror,twisted by heartbreaking grief,and faced with tradegy.i saw the movie and cried the whole time.i cried for the character's losses,mourned for them,felt like i was Sarah myself dealing with intolerable terror.History changes us all and sometimes we just have to escape.This book will forever leave an imprint on me.
B005FPT51K|5.0|We started with Skype set up on an old laptop. Had the webcam so it was free. Worked fine for the first year. Saw this at a friends house and loved having the night vision. Decided to buy it so we'd be able to monitor him at night without waking him up.<br />The setup was much easier than I expected. The app guides you through everything and I had it fully functioning in the first five minutes. The picture is great, specially in the dark. Now I just need to get it mounted on the wall where it's convenient.<br />The only problem we've noticed is the audio. Right now there is a clicking going on but I think it's because it's sitting next to the old laptop running Skype. I'll move it tomorrow after he wakes up and see if it fixes it.<br />After reading reviews, I didn't think the alerts worked very well but after testing for a couple minutes, it seems they work great. We put him down and he was moving around. I was watching him on my phone and set the sensitivity for the motion alert and within 30 seconds, my wife's phone was ringing an alert. I'm not interested to use it all the time but I think it will come in handy at times.<br />There's no visible light coming from the camera and you can't even see it sitting in a dark room. I think the posts that say they see a light may have the led light turned on. Haven't exactly figured out what this is but I think it may turn on an extra light. Messing around with it, I haven't noticed any difference.<br /><br />So far very pleased. Hope it continues to perform.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This was recommended to me and it is excellent.  I did have a slight problem with the beginning because the dialogue is quite fast in some places and has an English dialect.
B008N1V11U|4.0|You should defiantly get this at first it seems like the time will fly by but extra stuff happens just get it bro trust me!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboards specially for bilingual people. You can stay typing up to 3 different languages without having to switch settings. Spanish special characters are also displayed on the keyboard.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not stop reading this book, it's a beauty full love  story-I can't wait to read the entire book.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I love a good movie...however, when a good movie leads me to reading a great book, then I feel as if I've hit the jackpot.  In the course of a weekend, I was involved first hand (or so it felt) in the lives of Logan, Beth, Ben, Nana, Clayton, Zeus & Drake.  Nicholas Sparks writes in a way that makes me feel like I'm one of the heroines in his books just waiting for my hero to arrive.  I loved this book.  Any true romantic would.  Enjoy!
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Love the classic orchestra sounds in this soundtrack, nice to just have on in the background while the kids are playing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I have played Mahjong on my computer for several years and enjoyed it but this version is to simple to play often.  It is OK for a quick time filler but not my favorite game.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Pictures are very pretty. Especially like the reflection one, makes you really look closer at the puzzle. Soon I will try the one with the most pieces
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think you should get this app because when you play it your mind will just flow free into another world
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a heart warming sad tale I could relate to. Truly beautifully written, one of my favorite of all times.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!!! I had my doubts but when I seen ALL the women at work (even a few men) with it I knew I needed to read it!! And I'm glad I did... if you haven't read these books... get them!!!
B003I55BIA|5.0|This  book is out of this world. I love the love that it brings. This does have some pretty intense stuff for younger children.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|buy its worth it dont wast your money on the 3 dollar one its the same isact thing buy this one for free free i tell you.
1451695195|5.0|I am currently down to the last chapter. There were several parts of the book that I will never forget. I love the author's style in writing, every other chapters he mixes it up with things that were happening while he was in the coma and things that were happening in his life at the time and etc. it's easy to read this book with a skeptical eye, but considering the way how God works in people's lives especially from what you see in this person's life from a man who didn't believe in God and now has a 360 degree turnaround, obviously this man has a man purpose and maybe what God may be trying to tell you can be found in this book.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Jason Bourne is one of the all-time best action characters. My family and I have been Bourne fans for years.

B007V9N5R8|4.0|The ColorMunki Display has made a very noticeable difference my computer screen.  I can now adjust and edit my photos with more confidence knowing that the colors will transfer more accurately to a printer.  I have not yet tried the color checker passport and will update this review once I do.  The only reason ColorMunki Display did not receive 5 stars is because it was a royal pain to install.  I had to install and uninstall it over seven times and download a bunch of software from their website before I could get the display to read through my computer and recognize my monitor.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun to play, but has a little different process than some other solitaire games I have played.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is so rich with complicated situations and emotions that I could read it over and over and never get bored.  Highly recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good basic calculator, with large buttons, so it is easy to work with.  I have enjoyed using it.  I don't have to carry another calculator when I have this one with me.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A great exploration into the human condition the things we assume the things we take for granted and the impact on us  of our relationships over time and our encounters with people
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has different levels of play.  It wasn't hard to learn, but it increases in difficulty and stretches my brain.
B0049IHX2C|3.0|I lobe MB movies, I have all the three , but  I did not enjoyed the second one as  did with  the first, and third.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I loved this book so much. It's definitely for teens because of their language and actions.  It's about a girl named Alison who has died and her four best friends getting text messages from possibly her.  This is very exciting with a bunch of drama.  EXCELLENT!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Keeping in mind this is a young adult book, I felt the first part of the book accurately made me feel like I was back in my teens. The story ramped up, and was entertaining, page turning, and definitely recommend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love facebook have it on my computer, love that I can talk to cousins and friends that live far away
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Same director who did Drive. Very cool movie. Tom Hardy is very very good in it. If you are a true movie fan then I recommend you check it out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|any hasbro game comes highly recommended, my three year old grandaughter loves this game, keeps kids entertained for hours and hours
0743270754|5.0|This is a very long book and I've just begun to read it.  I can already tell how interesting it will be because of the detailed day-by-day tidbits about Lincoln's rivals as well as his life, each tidbit interesting in itself.  I love a historical book that actually takes me back to the time period and lets me experience it as if through the eyes of an omniscient contemporary.
B0091REZMW|5.0|highly recommend any hidden object game, lots of fun playing this and looking for the hidden objects buy it for fun
B000ME5B30|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It explained a lot dealing with mother earth. Al Gore did an outstanding job with this one.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|highly recommended, grandkids love this game and told me to download it on my kindle, lots of fun for everyone
0307279189|5.0|I fell in love with every aspect of this book: the author and his journey, all the people he met, and all the things he learned along the way. It really inspired me to want to better myself. I typically have a sort of exercise anxiety, yet during and after reading this, I felt a sort of empowerment as a human to utilize what I was built to do, all worries aside. McDougall did a great job with this piece and I highly recommend it to others. (PS I bought the paperback)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is fun but a little harder then I thought, but my grandson loves it so it was worth it
B001NZMWPM|5.0|It's the classic Scorpions album. You don't get too much better than this one.<br /><br />From the title song Blackout to China White and everything in between it's awesome.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|Dave Grohl said in the Foo Fighters' documentary Back and Forth that he wanted this band to have a big guitar sound and showed them record this album in analog and it sounds like a classic album. This album has some really tight songs in it with some intriguing guitar lines.

Yet I can honestly state my review of \\"Everville\\" is straightforward and unbiased by this relationship.]<br /><br />\\"Everville\\" is a fun, fast, and enjoyable read--for a quick comparison, plot-wise, one could say this book resembles a quasi- [[ASIN:1582187916 Alice in Wonderland]] meets [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]] by way of [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]].<br /><br />The outer hub of the novel concerns protagonist Owen Sage's first days at Easton Falls University, his teaming up with a couple of friends, and his signing up for academic and social clubs--but there is more here than what initially meets the eyes.<br /><br />In almost no time Sage finds himself tumbling down what appears to be a vast \\"hole\\" -- all within the first couple of pages. It is an abrupt beginning that at first seems a bit too contrived, but I was soon pleased to find myself becoming more and more interested in what follows. Huff creates an alternate world beyond that hole that is not only colorful but compelling.<br /><br />The world into which Owen fell (we later learn it was only his consciousness that plummeted) is foreign, as one might guess, and it is here that Huff has fun with some of the wordplay: when Owen asks a tall, slender bystander where he is, the man says, \\"Here is Everville. We are somewhere between here and there, sometime between yesterday and another day.\\" The bystander, he finds out, is the Keeper, a wise OLD man who works hard to protect the race of people from which he had himself come, the Fron: short- and thick-bodied, hairless, large-eared, friendly and clever folk. The Fron are in the midst of a crisis: they are being beset upon by an aggressive, ugly race known as Them. (It's not the only odd appellation here: the Purgatory-like land some of their kin are being sent to is known as The Other in Between.)<br /><br />In the \\"real\\" world, Owen Sage's best friends Dante and Anika are almost always beside him: not only do they take an art class together, but it is through this class that they join a soon-to-be-important art club, as well as one called the Echo Club, and it is in those three common places that they not only learn of Owen's experiences, but also receive training that will become extremely important when it comes to defeating an enemy not only demonizing the world beneath them, but their very own \\"upper\\" world as well.<br /><br />While, indeed, this is not TLofR, it is a fun, exciting story with hardly any down time. The plot is self-propelled and a breeze to read. It took no time to finish once I began reading, and I enjoyed the tale a lot. Its derivative aspect aside (there's even an invisibility rope and a stone that allows Owen to see the Keeper's memories), I was overall impressed with the author's creativity and enjoyed encountering the various creatures and inhabitants of the lands.<br /><br />The author does a good job of juggling our attention between the twin worlds, and how the actions in one affect the other.  It is certainly NOT a spoiler to reveal that toward the end a competition in one world becomes important to the war in the other.  However, I would have liked more description of the games AND the strategy sessions leading up to them. The occasional glimpses within them were tantalizing: an excellent philosophical discussion on the relative worth of focus and perception -- and a later one involving such contrasting elements as impulse and caution -- were well done and intellectually strong.<br /><br />I would also have liked to see a little more characterization of the secondary characters...Anika and Dante and other characters could have been more highly evolved.  Perhaps giving us some more information via dialogue or interplay would improve that.<br /><br />Similarly, while anexcellent physical explanation of the worlds of Everville and The Other in Between did occur, it was not until almost halfway through the novel. Likewise, I would have liked a bit more clarification on who the evil \\"Them\\" faction were, as well as their motivations.<br /><br />The good news is that I think the author has the talent to amend these elements by the next installment, which I look forward to.<br /><br />ONE LAST POINT: I think this is a Young Adult text, and should be marketed as such. It is not meant in any way to deflect my admiration for the author's work...it simply means that while I feel his work contains a lot of power and intellect and action, I think it would benefit from aiming it at that audience first. Like the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy--or the other works mentioned previously--great novels targeted for the YA crowd can also be appreciated by all ages.excellent physical explanation of the worlds of Everville and The Other in Between did occur, it was not until almost halfway through the novel.

B0067AC5KA|4.0|If you have not read this trilogy, now is the time.  It takes a little more time, but well worth it.
0525423656|3.0|I too was a bit disappointed in this sequel. I felt like I was chasing after the action and could never quite catch it. I kept waiting to see what the big cliffhanger was gonna be and it just wasn't there. I'm looking forward to Reached. I can't wait to see if it was all a big experiment, or if Ky managed to put himself on the match list. I can't wait to see how this ends for them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am so glad I had this experience.  Sisterly love and sacrifice.  Defiance against all that is wrong and unjust.  I highly recommend this trilogy
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It has been a while since I have read a Nicholas Sparks novel. This one was a good one to read. It is unlike any Nicholas Sparks novels I have read. It's very suspenseful and full of twists you don't expect. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading Nicholas Sparks or who had been put off by him based on his previous works being too mushy and romantic.
B007SGM084|3.0|Without a doubt, an adult novel.  I found the main focus on money and very explicit sexual encounters.  It is not for the faint of heart.
B000GWE44U|5.0|A truly chilling movie.  Jack Nicholson does a fantastic job of scaring the hell out of you.  I highly recommend this film.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It is a mystery that strikes to the core.  How can families survive such evil and deception?  I recommend this as a &#34;must read.&#34;
B002MFV2IK|4.0|I loved this movie, a great cast and laughs from beginning to end. Both ladies are at their very best.
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|This is a review of the movie itself and not the actual blu ray product of the movie. :-)<br /><br />A very Outstanding and Original Screenplay.  Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Lee are perfectly cast in their roles as is the entire supporting cast.<br /><br />A very fast talking moving.<br /><br />It's for Kids!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I haven't even played the game and its asking me to rate. Also when I click play it crashes. I don't have high hopes for this game...
B009HNDCC4|5.0|If you ever wondered why gays and lesbians clash you should watch this episode. It plays very well and was better Han Netflix.  If you love satire this is the show to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best brave game you could get for free. However it is a challenge to complete. So my advice is to try your best at this game. HAVE FUN!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a very good game much more better graphics and sound than temple run 1, you can play this game all day long it's simply awesome.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved Martin's writing style. This is a story of adventure, mystery and passion that never ends. The characters are unforgettable.
0385738757|4.0|The Scorch Trials by James Dashner is the second book in the Maze Runner Trilogy.  Continuing the adventure right from the end of The Maze Runner, this book/series continues to amaze.  Thomas has survived the Maze and he wants answers.  Before he can get answers a representative from WICKED reveals that the rescue was all a sham.  He must undergo another test or die.  The stakes are made even higher when he is separated from a dear friend.<br />The action in this book is nonstop and it definitely has the potential to maintain a fandom.  I firmly believe that there are some books you need to start at the beginning and can't just pick up.  This is a book that if you started with The Scorch Trials you would not get what was happening.  It is imperative that you start with The Maze Runner.<br />I really enjoyed this book and swallowed it within 2 days.  (Thank the Gods for school vacation.)  I would have to say that I think my only big criticism of this book would be how often Thomas sleeps or is knocked out.<br />I firmly recommend this book like I said in my review of The Maze Runner, for teens who liked The Hunger Games or Divergent.
0307352153|5.0|Title: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking<br />Author: Susan Cain<br />Publisher: Broadway<br />Pages: 352<br /><br />Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking was a great read. Written by an introvert, Susan Cain, who was a quiet and soft-spoken lawyer on Wall Street. Susan had the ability to be a powerful negotiator, not in spite of her introversion, but because of it.<br /><br />Part One: The Extrovert Ideal<br />Part one discusses the cultural shift from a society that valued character and integrity to one that valued personality and gregariousness.<br /><br />Part Two: Your Biology, Your Self?<br />This section of the book explores physiological and psychological studies done concerning introversion and extroversion to discover how our temperament is an intricate part of who we are.<br /><br />Part Three: Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal<br />This section looks at other cultures and what their \\"ideal\\" temperament is considered by society. It especially focuses on the Asian culture and the value that they place on thoughtful study and meditation rather than socialization.<br /><br />Part Four: How to Love, How to Work<br />This is where the book brings it all home and becomes very practical by giving advice for when you should act outside your temperament and how; how to talk to members of the opposite type and the value in conversations with opposites; and how to relate to your introverted child.<br /><br />As an introvert myself, I really enjoyed this book. It took me quite a while to get through, though not necessarily because it was boring. I think more because I've been spending my time lately on things other than reading. It was a fairly easy read, but still one that I would have to read in sections and then spend a few days ruminating over the information I had learned.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many times I have referenced this book recently in conversations with both introverts and extroverts. It has been a very valuable source of insight into my own temperament and the reasons for it. Though I had come to a point that I had learned that I was definitely introverted and that my temperament was normal and ok and a healthy part of who I am and I had learned how I function best and happiest because of my temperament, this book gave me a small push toward stepping out of my comfort zones at times as well. This book also encouraged me that there are many others out there like me and that I AM normal.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you are an introvert, married to an introvert, the parent of an introvert, friends with an introvert, the child of an introvert... or just ever come in contact with an introvert. And considering that introverts make up approximately 1/3 of the people we know it's safe to say that you have a few in your life.

B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book after working with teenagers for 27 years.  It indicated how and why they feel like they do about their parents.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|The tactic most used in the film for scares was \\"the cat in the cabinet\\".  You know the one where a person hears a noise, or doesn't, and opens a cabinet and a cat jumps out to startle them, and you?  You know how that doesn't ever really work?<br />Yeah.. this movie doesn't ever really work.  It's not even worth the time to write why...<br /><br />Please believe that whomever is writing 5-star reviews for this movie must be getting paid to do it.  In no way could this movie ever be rated by even the most die-hard fan of Ethan Hawke as more than 3-stars...  ever...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|is there a update or something cause mine is lagging if there is no update plz fix!!!! the screen moves and its really weird

B00005RD9B|5.0|While some of The Cure faithful may feel aggrieved by the absence - 'A Forest' notwithstanding - of tracks from their gloomiest period (Faith, Seventeen Seconds, Pornography), the more casual listener will find much to enjoy here. Having had a big Cure phase in my teens, I might quibble that the Boys Don't Cry/Three Imaginary Boys era is under-represented. 'Jumping Someone Else's Train' and 'Killing An Arab', for instance, would have been preferable to some of the relatively non-descript material post-'Friday I'm In Love'. It seems odd also given how fashionable angular post-punk has been in the 00s to skimp on this early period, but ultimately you can't fault this as an introduction to the band.<br /><br />What is great about this colllection is that The Cure had a habit of reinventing themselves and releasing their most resonant and accessible material as singles. This is not to say that they were a singles band - far from it, your next purchase ought to be 'Disintegration' if you don't own it already - but that this captures the band at their most varied, eccentric best. Whereas some Best-Ofs can seem fairly by-the-numbers, soulless experiences, 'Greatest Hits' is a joy for its vivid eclecticism.<br /><br />Despite their reputation (not always unfounded) for bleak introspection, 'Greatest Hits' reveals Robert Smith to be one of the best pop songwriters of his generation. 'In Between Days', 'Close To Me', 'Just Like Heaven' are pop perfection, while 'A Forest' and 'Lullaby' harnesses the band's predilection for acid-spiked paranoia in a universably accessible form. Meanwhile the deranged, off-kilter pop of 'The Lovecats' and 'The Caterpillar' straddles the unlikely territory somewhere between these two poles: too saccharine to be goth, too bonkers by most pop tastes. Then you have the raw energy of 'Boy's Don't Cry' and the comparatively lush and expansive pop sensibility of 'Lovesong' and 'Pictures of You'
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Mel Gibson did superb job with this movie! It had everything action, romance, fighting,.sadness, a great villian. It will take you everywhere! Your missing out if you don't watch this one

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so fun me and my little brother absolutely love this game. This game real good strategy and organization.
B004M5HUXE|1.0|I read several reviews that gave high praise to this book.  As I started the book I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't.  It was simply the worst book I have ever read, Period. Many of the minor characters are completely self-centered and boring.  The prose was mind numbing.  Mellor's dialect was uninteligable. The ending was a yawn. Read it if you must and form your own opinion.
B004UID2LC|5.0|People are saying that this app stinks but it is a great app and I think it's the best you tube app out there, just don't always, no, never look in the recent section because there are some pretty disturbing things.

B008FOB124|5.0|det er fantastiske lyde, der kommer ud af højttalerne - både oplivende og afstressende på  én gang.  Svært at finde ud af, hvilke sprog, der bliver sunget på - lidt af hvert.

B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Amazing songs for an amazing game. These songs are amazing even outside the game. 5 stars all day long .
B00A4AI19I|5.0|My favorite Brahms symphonic cycles -- one each for a slightly different mood -- are those by Szell and Bernstein on Sony, that of Mackerras on Telarc, and this one conducted by Otto Klemperer. Bernstein's and Mackerras' strike me as the performances that are more down-to-earth and on a human scale, with Szell's about halfway up the mountain and Klemperer's sitting poised for the final assault on the summit. Some have characterized these renditions as granitic -- I've characterized them as granitic, but listening to them again after a relatively long interval I think I might hedge on that just a bit. There is a human face on these performances, though perhaps it is carved rather than made of flesh, but it's still recognizable. But now I think I'm going off the deep end a bit, so let me get to the point and then stop. These are monumental versions of the Brahms symphonies and deserve a place in most people's libraries. Though monumental, they are far from cold. The two overtures included and the Alto Rhapsody (with Christa Ludwig) are similarly excellent, and the recording of Ein deutsches Requiem is commonly viewed, with justification, as a classic if not definitive rendition of the work. Brahms' Haydn Variations, though recorded in mono, dishes up just more of the same propulsive grandeur. Many of Klemperer's recordings don't quite justify his reputation as a legendary conductor. These do.

B00338QENI|5.0|I wasn't sure this book would be interesting enough to get through, but I had no trouble. The author spent quite a bit of time getting things right and telling an interesting story. I really enjoyed this book and recommended it for my book club.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this. If you liked Jericho or 28 Days Later I think you will too.  The characters are well developed and the story line is dynamic enough to keep you guessing long after the first few episodes.  The story stagnates slightly in season 2 but picks up again after they leave the farm.  In short, you and your loved ones will enjoy this (so long as you are not made ill over zombie gore!).
0307749347|5.0|I’ve listened to a few other audiobooks on positive psychology, so initially I was unsure whether there would be much significant new information here.  It turns out there definitely was, so I’m glad I got this audiobook and listened to it.
1451695195|4.0|As a believer in the afterlife, I found Dr. Alexander's account of his near-death experience very interesting.  I fully believe HIS belief that his experience of heaven was genuine.  He certainly makes the best argument possible for the authenticity of his journey.  Skeptics like Sam Harris (a neurosurgeon who hates all religion) were quick to jump on the book as &#34;unscientific.&#34;  I think that such skeptics can't see out of their materialist box.  I would say that I was 90% convinced.<br /><br />Lars Troide
B001DJLD1M|5.0|Glad to have all 3 Matrix movies in one place.  The 4th animated movie didn't grab my attention, but that's not why I bought this.  The 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies are really one movie, and there's no reason not to get all 3 at once.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Works great. Allows you to watch movies in any room you chooses. No worry about DVD player or VCR. Use with IPad to watch Netflix, Hulu plus, etc.
B0034PJWJ8|4.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it while in high school.  This blu-ray is not put together very well, though.  The chapters menu doesn't allow you to move through several chapters at one time.  If I want to get to chapter 24 I need to move through chapters 1 - 23 first.  This is very annoying if I want to get to my favorite scenes quickly.<br /><br />No extras.  You get an alternate audio track of the director's comments, but that has limited value.<br /><br />This wouldn't be my first choice for buying a blu-ray of this movie.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Entertaining and fun, what more can you ask for..... I have to go on for a 20 word minimum...

But when you make your own pay....

I work with many elderly and people in pain (in a dental office) and am bringing more understanding to my interactions with patients. It is not often when one can enjoy a good read, be entertained, and also feel uplifted, inspired, and actually improved by a book.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|Excellent picture quality and all that jazz.  The extras are fantastic.  My kid loves watching the character modeling sequences.  The Day & Night mini-movie is good.  And there's another TS short too.  Also, you probably already know this, but this movie is da jam!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Really love this game- but two BIG PROBLEMS : They promise Glu points if you install and play other Glu games but you don't get any. Ive been a fan of Glu games but fealt tricked into downloading more of their games. I found some games that I liked from them on the list for 10 credits and played them for a while- NO GLU POINTS!!EVER!!  I thought that was scrappy and uninstalled games on principle.<br />Also game crashes and you lose your progress often.<br />Very disappointing.
B0095P29EG|5.0|THOR had a flaw in his upmake, power hunger, self centered and a host of other negative quality, the minute that he stopped promoting that he was ALL THAT.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|It is a great true story about a woman that is persistant in what she undertakes. It was refreshing to read something that wasn't filled with smut and got back to the basics.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a great love story!! It takes you on an emotional roller coaster, love and hate all in one book. Who won't fall in love with these two?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very well written and kept my interest with its great twists and turns.  It was also very different with the wife being the game player instead of the husband playing games.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Very fun and can play quickly or take your time.  You can pay to level up faster but you don't have too :-)  enjoy!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This is a great adventure and action movie. Also needs some more mistery to solved but in general a did like it.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The story line was great, but I don't understand why the F word had to be used so frequently. Disappointed. If not for the foul language and opening scene nudity it would have been a great movie.
B00BHMF578|3.0|This was an entertaining film, but not one of much substance, unless all you want is a patriotic high. A movie that is less engaging because the ending is not one of substance. Good actors no doubt, but they couldn't save it. Something is so wrong with the script.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is romantic, sexy, and mesmerizing. It is an Amazing read from start to finish. It is less kinky than fifty shades of grey but just as captivating.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Very good musical arrangements for piano and cello and love the mix of classical and contemporary music.  We play this all the time.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|I have seen all the doctors and I have watched most, so I am a tough sell.  I was drawn to watch them and looked forward to each of them for character development and story continuum.  I liked them.
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|it's all gone terribly wrong! where is the real Lee Child? release him! because this is absolute rubbish! as bad as trying to convince us that tom cruise makes a good jack reacher.<br />we'll try to forgive you these failures... but please do not chase your fans away with a crappy book 18. Wanted Man was written to just fill pages
B003NTSBUG|5.0|The movie takes you into the mind of it's lead character without you realizing it and then just when you think you are in one direction, it turns you around.
B0086700CM|5.0|its good rally like it and with each game from temple run get even better sometimes a bit challangeing at times but well worth get this game ... so from here u pickup as game ends and goes to temple run 2 which both has stunning graphics and best part totaly free :D ...
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent, wonderful movie!  I hope it wins an Academy Award or two or three..... Very entertaining. I'd watch it again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't wait for the movie. I love Nicholas Sparks and anything he does but this one is my favorite so far.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show.  It is basically a soap opera, but the characters are interesting, the scenery is marvelous, and the plot is very interesting (and thickening with each season!).
0307950654|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  However, the first 100 pages seemed more like a very long epilogue to Pride and Prejudice as opposed to a mystery.  I thought it captured the beloved characters well, but wanted more of a mystery.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I guess my favorite will always be the tenth anniversary version. This one has its moments, but I'm not really sure how necessary it seems.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The numbers are big and it is simple to use. Never have had a problem with it. Would recommend it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a gripping story that kept me involved. I'm looking forward to reading the next one to see what happens to the characters that were developed in this one.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Good gameplay. Causes the phone to stop responding after a few games. Inspire 4G (Desire HD)<br />Would be better if it kept a few best times instead of just one.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Pac-man lite is really just a teaser...there was only one screen available and stopped in the middle of play and ads popped up. Could never  get past the first screen. Not worth the time it took to down load.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Lee Child's giving us something to think  about and worry about with this Reacher novel. The world is getting more dangerous.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|This program, like the Amazon Appstore app, continually crashes. I've had to force the program to stop and restart countless times. Now, Amazon thinks I have several hundred Android devices. And, because of that, I try to avoid using these apps if I can, although the Appstore app is required for several games to operate properly...not to mention the install instructions are beyond stupid, ie: &#34;To manually install app, go to Amazon Underground...&#34;<br /><br />Tell me...HOW IN THE BLOODY BLUE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO INSTALL THE &#34;AMAZON UNDERGROUND&#34; APP WHEN I HAVE TO GO TO THE &#34;AMAZON UNDERGROUND&#34; APP TO INSTALL THE DAMN THING???
1616550414|5.0|If your a fan of the Zelda series then get it. Everything you ever wanted to know is in this book! Best purchase I've ever made.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I'd heard of this program from several friends who swear by it (and a few who swear at it :D ), so I figured I'd pick it up. Haven't yet used it.
B00338QENI|5.0|I  am so amazed by this book!  The author wrote a wonderful account of a woman's life bringing her to life as more than a source of HeLa cells. You could feel the family's emotions as they told their story. Very easy to understand as the author does not use overly technical terms when covering a lot of biological terms. It really made me think about the value of a human life. One of the best books of this genre that I have read.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Excellent game! It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you figure it out, it's hours of non-stop fun!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Easy read. HAPPY ending.  Everyone enjoys a love story, now and then.  A little predictable, but will make a good movie.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|Like most of Amazon's apps, this has a nasty tendency to crash at times when you really don't want it to. There are other, free, players online that work far better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I simply love this show!  I love the twists and turns of the storyline.  I feel like I am part of this awesome family, between the secrets, scandals and gossip, everything is so true of life no matter what era!
B004UHSB5A|5.0|Who hasn't sat in a park on some sunny afternoon and played Dominoes the way it was meant to be played? Unfortunately, you can't line them on end and tip them over ;)
B003JH0LSW|4.0|I purchased this item after months of waiting for the price to go down.  Finally at around $25 I decided to go for it.  I purchased this as new from a &#34;non-Amazon&#34; seller here on Amazon.  The product arrived in great shipping packing, however soon after opening I realized that this Deluxe edition vinyl does not have the best packaging INSIDE the main box.<br /><br />To explain what is given to you in this Deluxe Edition Vinyl (as it is not easily understood from the picture) you receive a nice cardboard box, similiar to those given in classic box-set records, that is about an inch thick, and a little bigger than an LP (so that the LP inside can fit inside the box).  The top of the box is seen on the upper left of the photo, with the bottom of the box (with the ribbon attached to the inside of it) on the upper right with the LP on top of it.  This box is unfortunately prone to curving inward when placed in close contact with other records as mine was when I received it.  When you open the box you first see a gatefold sleeve (seen opened up with the pictures and CD placed on top of it) that looks an awful lot like a normal vinyl gatefold sleeve, which I thought was cool.  Inside this gatefold sleeve on the right is an unfortunately poor designed slit that holds the photos in place, similar to a pocket.  The downside to this is the fact that with continued movement, the photos will hit the edge of the slit, ripping into and/or through the inner-right panel (which had already happened to mine).  I would return it, however it was of no fault of the seller as it was still &#34;new&#34; and I didn't want them to be out money for something they had no control over.  These photos however are magnificent.  They're printed with very high quality vibrant inks on nice photo paper, and are in their own protective sleeve to protect them in the pouch.  On the left side is a copy of the CD in a cool and different sleeve (seen on the center bottom of the photo) which is always a good thing to have.  Underneath this initial gatefold sleeve is the poster, as seen in the picture below the LP on the upper right side (it's a bit hard to see).  The poster is what you would expect from a vinyl, and is still a pretty nice thing to have.  Finally under the poster, you receive a vinyl copy of the album, which as far as I know is simply the normal version of the vinyl (it's shrink-wrapped and labeled like a new vinyl).<br /><br />The vinyl itself has its ups and its downs.  As I opened it, I noticed that there appeared to be fingerprints and marks on the vinyl (even though it had just been opened, and I hadn't even touched it yet).  Overall the vinyl doesn't look the best, with a slightly torn label and some odd squiggly marks under the label that must have happened in production.  However, my thoughts were changed as soon as I played this for the first time.  I'm using a Shure M97xe, which is a pretty mid-range cartridge for a turntable, and it sounds excellent!  I've played newer vinyl before, but Band of Horses really goes the extra mile to make sure that you get great sound out of this 180 gram vinyl.  I would HIGHLY recommend buying this vinyl if you're looking to get some new LPs; it's great!<br /><br />Overall I gave this Deluxe Edition set a 4 out of 5.  I felt that the content was spectacular for the $25 I paid, however the packaging was disappointing.  Things became loose and ripped and didn't seem put together very well, but nevertheless it's still a great thing to have.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this to any serious Band of Horses fan who's looking to get into/continue loving vinyl.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You know how versatile this program is for your desktop PC, or your laptop, so why not get one for your tablet?
B008LFY6NI|3.0|all you do is the same thing which is spin a shape a touch it to make it have Colorado.DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Don't want to buy a Kindle, because you have an Android Tablet? Then you don't want this program...YOU NEED IT! It functions exactly like the Kindle, without the cost of adding yet another electronic device to your library.
B00338QENI|5.0|As someone who is closely involved with the process of consenting patients about tissue and blood donations this book brought great insight into why these procedures are in place. It is well written and gives the forgotten family behind the story of Henrietta Lacks its due.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Has your wifi been hacked? One of your devices not responding? Are your neighbors leeching off your signal? Are there other wifi routers in the neighborhood interfering with yours? Is your signal getting to your laptop upstairs? Then you need to get this program, and see just how strong your wifi output is.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|OMG!  It is wonderful and so addictive.  I can't stop.  This a wonderful game and you keep playing & playing, trying to get a better score or to knock some time off.  Basically I love this game and recommend it to everyone.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I didn't watch this show on TV but my granddaughter did so I got it and Loved it, It is a really great show.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I loved the movie! Listening to  cd is like being in the theater right behind the orchestra ,listening to the awesome singing! The tears flow freely,beautiful CD
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I collect all of the Criminal Mind shows so yes this is one I would get because it part of the series but really it a great show.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What an incredible story.<br />Slightly technical, very entertaining, believable story that I couldn't put down.<br />If you have any interest in mars or human space travel this is a must read.<br />I wish I cold find more books by this author.
B00005K3O4|3.0|This is just one of those crazy movies that if you like horror movies then you will like this one
B008220C38|4.0|I finally got around to seeing this.  Bold, to take a realist masterpiece and re-imagine it in such a sometimes surreal style.  It works, though, and I was very happy with the casting and the tone.  I did not want to like Kiera as Anna, but did.<br /><br />We lose Levin's story in the movie (sadly) but get, I think, Anna's story, told, perfectly for a new medium and a generation that will never read the book.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe, if you have ever watched it a complicated show its hard to keep up with but worth it, it is a good show .
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Really enjoy having the extra options the HD Camera (Kindle Tablet Edition) offers. Loved the video option as well! Seems to work beautifully. I like the on line user manual that comes with it too.  So far this seems to be very user friendly, I need all the help I can get. :-) Quality of the camera's photos and videos is beautiful I think.
B005MZIF4Q|5.0|I didn't get this my grandson did and he loves it he likes to find out all the different stuff that is out there
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is an App I find I want to use with many of my pictures! Enjoy checking out the different options in \\"effects\\" and finding the one that compliments the photo the best. Ease of use is something important to me and this is that for me. A winner. So many more options there I haven't used much as yet but know I will.
0307716988|5.0|I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson and the reason I got this is because this is in his own words and that is what makes this great
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is so much fun! I never thought of myself as an artist but this game truly releases the creativity in me!<br />I find it a fun way to communicate with my daughters across the miles. It is definitely an addicting game - enjoy!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love Vampires and this is one of the best, The Vampire Diaries is one of the best series today so yes I would get this it is great.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I normally dont play games but I found this as a free app of the day I didnt even look I just downloaded and boy car rides go much fastef when im playing this game. The only issue I have is I cant access the leaderboard I have a sprint samsung 3 with the most up to date version hopefully the next update will bring that up
B0085MK2GM|5.0|It is known:GENIUS. I have several recordings of WTK. Could recommend also Fischer and Kempf. Whatever you buy Gould is needed for comparison.
B00AATV046|5.0|Whats not to love with these old wonderful Holdiay Movies. First I love that they have good decent holiday values and everyone in the family can watch them. perfect for a movie night Second Cary Grant is so perfect in this. Just all round good fun
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The best Bond film ever, great storyline, just enough action , intrigue and drama without going overboard as in the previous Bond fodder.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great action with a somewhat predictable line. Nevertheless, it was worth watching.  Though the movie is clocked at just over 2 hours, it does not go by slow.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Beautiful scenes, smooth graphics, an enjoyable story. All in all, a great game. But is a good reason to stay on dry land.
B00A757EFW|5.0|What can I say----it's Pac-Man! What's not to like! It is as fun as it was the first time I  played it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun energy based game. I would recommend it for any horse enthusiast.<br />Would be good for kids and adults alike.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|This is easily one of the best series I've seen in a long time, and few things compared to the joy of getting season one and devouring it in three sittings. There's lots of characters, so if you're not fond of a certain group of horrible incestuous Malfoy look-alikes, there's plenty of other awesome people/groups to root for. Also, there are NOT too many characters in this, anyone who says that obviously hasn't read anything by Melanie Rawn.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm very much looking forward to getting my hands on season two from the library. The only reason I gave this four stars is because due to HBO's stranglehold, it doesn't come out for a price I'm willing to spend, even here on Amazon. I would pay $20 (which is about what I spend on any other series, often less), but I refuse to buy until HBO stops with their ridiculous inflation.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I was a King fan but this is by far the worst book I have ever read.  It seems King has run out of time thought.  If you want to read a book built around the use of a young boy obsesed with the naked female body, drunk and uses foul language then give it a try.  King let me down also regarding the entire plot and and disconnect of the characters.  It seems they will print anything he writes and hope Kings reputation will sell it.  This is the second King book I have read that had so much foul language and lost plot I had to quit reading.  I personally am sick and tired of tired authors who resort to gutter language, disconnected story lines and unimaginative plots.  THE LAST STEPHEN KING BOOK FOR ME.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Basically this app is good but in order to increase productivity if new downloaded files can be organised more easilyw,  it would be very helpful. For sample if I want to transfer the d recently downloaded file to a three level deep folder..it is not very covenientI I can imagine that with limitation of size of App. It is a challenge but some smart idea can perhaps make it easy to do that. Hopefully!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great book, Flynn is a fantastic author in all of her novels I have read, would recommend any of them
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I was surprised that I had not heard of this move, it was fantastic.  Great movie, based on a true story.  Highly recommend.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book was a great read.  It was engaging and the main character was likeable (which seems to be rare sometimes in the &#34;chick books&#34;).  The story was a little bit of a different one and it got to the point where I did not want to put the book down.  I would definitely recommend!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm the kind of person that picks movies and books apart, but I forget that I'm reading fiction with Lee Child! I didn't guess the ending ahead of time.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|This charger was exactly what I wanted!  I've had it for a couple months now and have had no trouble with it.  It charges my iphone 5 quickly:)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great to be able to transfer my Kindel books to my Samsung Tablet.  Hope this works for anyone who would download this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An excellent book keeps you riveted to the unfolding story all the way. It leaves you waiting for the next book to see what happens next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was hands down one of my favorite books. I started it on a Saturday afternoon while I was at wok, then ended up staying up until 2 in the morning just to finish it. It is beyond anything you ever expected and was impossible to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent book keeps you riveted to the unfolding story all the way. It leaves you waiting for the next book to see what happens next.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've tried some online games &amp; I'm not a big fan of them outside of a little solitaire. I really enjoy playing flow free though.  The puzzles are relaxing to play and makes you think a little, but not so much that you're stressed because it's coming up with words to beat friends or having to hit all the pigs or blow something up to get to the next level.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent read, with a surprising ending. Well worth the time can't wait for the nexr movies. The first was good but like the books you want more
B007R41E8O|5.0|Excellent graphics, enjoyable puzzles. One of the first games of this kind I had played. Have replayed it and really noticed how quickly the story went along. The narrative was visual only and kept things moving nicely.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|I was glad to see this movie came out in Blu-ray it is my favorite western. Package was received quickly
B003JTHXOK|4.0|An excellent book as always by Mr. Sparks. It is a page turner for sure. I hope the movie does the book justice!
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I am so excited to share my thoughts with you regarding this group of most talented musicians.  They complement each other all throughout this album.  I was in total awe listening to it the first time.  It also shows that Joe Bonamassa can do anything.  I am such a fan of his any way and he never disappoints me.  The best jazz album I've heard in a long time.<br />Thanks so much for your talent and keep up all your wonderful work.<br />Ali Handeguand
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|totally awesome if you are a problem solver like me it is super  fun once you understand the game hope you have as much fun as I am
B007EECSFA|4.0|Had a little trouble at the book's start. As the story developed I was hooked by the characters and the timeline set in both modern day and WW II London.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really cool game. I play it all the time. You won't be sorry if you buy it.
0307474275|5.0|Dan Brown is a seemingly interesting and well informed author. Though he mainly writes fictional books he has written a wide variety of genres.  His prize piece however would be The Da Vinci Code. This book would be what I consider to be a wonderful read. The book perfectly blends action, mystery, and humor. During the most critical times you will find yourself having a good laugh every now and then. The book starts out with a man chasing down the last member of a religious cult. Unfortunately he is killed and all of the secrets of the cult had been lost forever. It is up to his granddaughter and expert Robert Langdon to uncover a long string of clues in order to retrieve the secrets. Every chapter is short and packed full of action and mystery. This book has an addictive trait to it, each chapter ends with a detail that will not let you put down the book. Another great aspect of the book is how informative it is. Though the book is fiction it is actual very factual. I found myself constantly looking things up because it talked about things that I didn't even know existed. It is often criticized for having to do with several religious aspects however I would not call it offensive in any way. Some comparable works are his other novels such as Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress. They all involve puzzles and mysteries. I would give The Da Vinci Code a ten out of ten and recommend it to anyone the age of 16 and up.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book ever made in history.I recommend this book to every one in the world.And that is why you should read it more offton.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It worked for a while and I really liked it. But now it wont even open. It crashes every time I tap the app. Frustrating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an awesome game and everyone should get it!!! I have nothing else to say...<br />FREE FREE FREE ITS FREE!!!! All ages can play. You better get it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was in the unit that conducted the actual operation.  It is not exactly as it took place but the story as told covers most.  Some things will never be know... especially about the people that went.  Many getting old like me and many have died in many ways  they would laugh to think a move is made.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I read about 100 reviews before moving forward with this case and was nervous because of the bad reviews, but I love the case! It is compact but the kindle is quite protected - I took it on a trip to Patagonia. The concern about the device not fitting properly was not an issue for me.<br /><br />Also, I made a mistake when ordering and Amazon was really accommodating even though it was 100 percent my fault.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Couldn't wait to get to the end to see what happens but didn't want the book to end.  Best book I've read in a long time.  You become so attached to the characters, you feel like you know them.  A must read!
B000PAAH3K|3.0|I enjoyed the first few chapters immensely, as well as the conclusion. The author uses descriptive stories to make his case, and honestly I was not sure why he was telling some of the stories. Until the end of the book. I would suggest hanging in until the end if you make this purchase. Just commit to read the whole book or do not waste your money to buy it. Mr Gladwell has some cool ideas in this book, it just takes some time to pull them together with a unified theme.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Although it had little to do with Jason Bourne, it was a good film. A little long but worth the time in my opinion.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It had me sitting on the edge of my seat.<br />Even tho I know it's not 100% accurate, it's a story that should have been told.<br /><br />Thank goodness for those that work undercover protecting US citizens all over the world.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|Best book ever....get it... really funny....and just really good.....please get it the money is worth it!!!! Really good.. please please please get the book!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie to rent if you have kids (pre-teen +)<br />Clean, light, happy and lots of singing.<br /><br />We enjoyed it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I liked it. I feel like the next book will be repetitive. It was good though and it was cool.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is an excellent highly imaginative love story of a young girl and a werewolf responsible for saving her life.  Wonderfully entertaining, this fantasy is perfectly paced to maintain high reader interest. I can't wait to read the sequel!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much better than the oringnal<br />I think you should totally get it.It has better detail and is so much fun!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|It might feel heavy at first, but If you tame the mind and really read this book, your life is bound to change
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  It has been on my phone now for 6 months and I keep going back and playing a couple of levels at a time.  The music is &quot;haunting&quot; and beautiful.  The art is polished and well styled.  A really outstanding little indie game and well worth your money.
B00164GDD2|5.0|This is the best thing ever. The movie is wonderful, a great script, great pace, great dialog. One of the golden gems of cinema. And now that is on blu-ray a great way to see it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My whole family is hooked on The Walking Dead. It is well written and the acting is superb! Every week there is a cliff hanger and you can't wait for the next week. Awesome!!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I used it to change the thermal paste on my PS3, it now works like a charm. It does what it needs, it is not that thick, so careful when you apply it on the surface, also the curing time is around 20 hours, Just let it rest and be patient.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Film it as if it were a play. Yes, that's what they did. The presentation really did get in the way of the story.<br /><br />On the other hand, the interiors were both interesting and mostly beautiful. Kiera K was a believable lovesick woman but the Vronsky character didn't do the role justice. I think his looks were part of the reason.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! So much drama in such a small time. Can't wait to read the last one. It's going to be interesting to see Christian the husband.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm picky about my sci-fi and Wool has delivered extraordinarily well! I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in Shift. Thanks Hugh, for creating a wonderful escape in your writing!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it!! I can now tell when my kindle fire is actually charging because my charger is being stupid to me. Awesome app! would totally recommend to people.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Future of publishing. Hopefully not the future of mankind. Although I suppose as a metaphor we are already living it?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome book from start to finish.  It grabbed my attention on page one and wouldn't let me go until I finished the last page.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is great entertainment. It started out about family dedication and sticking to a plan. Now it's about the perils of sticking to a plan. Rooting for Walt...
B002L3ARRU|2.0|I don't mind rating the product, but I don't want to write a comment6 more words required.6 more words required.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I have a kindle fire and it wont let me off this stupid game sooo I don't think its for kindles
0307887898|3.0|If you are a small business owner then none of what this book covers comes as any great surprise. In essence keep costs down, continue to innovate and succeed through small increments. Such ideas are clearly novel to many larger businesses these days who have lost the reason for their existence. That is, to serve the customer.<br /><br />That said this book is still a worthwhile read for many simply because it is mentioned in so many places these days. It does provided some benefit, even for small businesses already doing what it extolls. However, I would not rate it as a 'must read' as I believe there are many other business books out there that are much more beneficial, especially to the smaller operator.<br /><br />So in summary, you should certainly add this book to your 'to read' list. However, if you are already a successful small business then you are probably already doing what the book talks about. If however, you are part of a large organisation that has become stagnant and 'lost its way' then you certainly read this book to understand that small is beautiful!
B004U8VUUC|5.0|This mystery, thriller does not leave you bored.<br />As you follow the story of the son of a wealthy, overbearing<br />father with intense dis-like and disapproval for this paticular son,<br />you are surprised at every turn.<br />If you're a mystery-thriller buff, you won't want to miss this one!

B00ADS98FC|5.0|I watched this movie on a whim the first time and have watched it several times in a couple days! Its hilarious, fun and has you singing the tunes long after it ends.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|What struck me about the book was the way in which Dan Pink was able to curate a lot of information about selling,<br />what it is and why many of us hate the thoughts of being a labeled a 'salesperson'. I agree wholeheartedly with<br />the source of that perception and resulting consequences.<br /><br />Nobody likes to be sold. We all like to think we are in control of the buying process. Now that we have more<br />information available to us, we do. What we don't always have is accurate information, or we have too much and<br />deciding what options are best can be confusing or paralyzing. So we still need someone to help us make the<br />right choice for us.<br /><br />That is the essence of what parts two and three of the book are about.<br />How do we want people to approach us, so that we feel they are serving us and helping us get what we want.<br />How do we wish to be engaged in the initial conversation. What would draw us in?<br />What would keeps us engaged without feeling we're talking to a robot?<br /><br />All questions the book answers and provides the tools for any sales person to achieve more and serve more and enjoy doing it.<br />As a business owner, I get to accept that a big part of my work is moving people.<br />Learning the lessons and letting go of the old perceptions...priceless.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My 4 month old was not sleeping in his crib until we purchased this, now he will lie down under the mobile and fall asleep! The remote is also a very cool option so I don't have to get out of bed to turn it on when I hear the baby start to fuss.<br /><br />This mama appreciates the extra sleep!
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|This is British humor at it's best. It starts slowly but builds to a really funny climax. Highly recommend for Monty Python and Mel Brooks fans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing, it's not just about the sex, it's about the story. Mr. Grey has a difficult time with commitment, therefore he cannot stay with Anastasia, and he is scared he will harm her to no end. The sex in this story means nothing compared to the story that goes along with the sex. Christian Grey is sexy & different and this intrigues Anastasia Steele. She slowly falls for Mr. Grey which follows her deflowering.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the horses and how you can make there food. you can also grom them, visit friends, name your horse and feed him treats.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Our three year old loves this game. We actually ended up downloading all the dr panda games and he enjoys them all. Only thing that would be nice is if periodically there were new things added to switch it up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game I know. Every body should get this game.  I play it every day it is so awesome.
0765325950|5.0|I've read this series longerthan my nephew has walked the planet, and he's a college graduate! I'm only half way throughtthe novel, but the new author has been faithful to Robert Jordan's style and drama. I am anxious to get to the end, and fight the urge to read the climax before I get there.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked this book, but I didn't love it.  It seemed to drag a bit throughout the middle of the book, to the point where I lost interest several times and took a break to read a few other books before finishing this one.  I found myself sighing on more than one occasion, wondering how much longer I had to read. But I was determined to finish it, and I finally did today.<br /><br />I have to say that I'm glad I saw it through to the end because the ending did pick up steam and recapture my attention.  And of course, the very end made me immediately want to start reading the next book.<br /><br />In all, Beautiful Darkness was a good book, but Beautiful Creatures was much better.  Hopefully, the next book will reclaim more of the first book's magic.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Works as advertised. Simple interface reminds me of my reading library app (Aldiko) so using it was a snap. Thanks.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Aside from the third movie of the trilogy; the movies are perfection.<br /><br />In Blu-ray remastering the visuals are better than they have ever been. Anyone with a Blu-ray player needs to own this.
B00ATU5JRA|3.0|Fool your friends, or yourself! A &#34;hack&#34; is a fix or modification of something to obtain a desired result. As far as I can tell, the only hack here is a way to gain information about &#34;my&#34; network WiFi connection via the permissions granted to install this app.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|An excellent Blu-Ray; and a credit to the format.<br /><br />The detail and visuals of the sceneary make this a must for Blu-Ray because it would be dulled in any other format.<br /><br />The story line is winding endearing and intriguing.<br /><br />You will enjoy this show; even if you might not be the kind who could admit it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I likes the beginning, very clever way of relating story.  Didn't care for the ending, hoping for a better ending.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|I do not love this album as much as I am supposed to.<br /><br />I bought believing the critical hype (sound unheard, if you will) and I was not really impressed.<br /><br />There are a few catchy songs, but it kind of gets washed in a sonic river of kind of the same drone again and again.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read.  the story is about the lives of the residents of an English village, I was thinking it would similar to a Maeve Binchy novel.  NO.  The stories reference nothing but abuse.  Drug abuse, child abuse, child molestation.  There is not one feel good moment in this book.  I read all of the Harry Potter books, it's hard to believe the same person wrote this miserable book.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Elegant story with incredible characters and a beautiful message.  Any race or religion could find this &#34;wild&#34; tale relatable.  Ands that's a tall order!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found the book;fifty Shades Darker, interesting, held my attention.<br />What I didn't like; too many sex stories.  Once you start reading, one doesn't want to stop.
B002LB13SE|1.0|This movie wasn't much of a horror movie or scary at all. It was just a bunch of murder and violence. And the rape scene was absolutely awful, they showed it for way too long, the girl actually looked like she was being raped. It made me sick and I had to walk out of the room during the scene. Such realistic rape scenes should not be made for entertainment.
B008S80OU2|5.0|I thought it was time for a fresh review of this collection. First of all, it is a beautiful box set but what most big fans are interested in is the \\"rarities\\" and \\"broadcasts\\" cds and there is no download or separate cd purchase option at this time. Any self-respecting fan will already own all the other cd's.  The upside to the regular albums is that \\"On Your Feet\\", \\"Mirrors\\", \\"Cultosaurus\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Club Ninja\\", and \\"Imaginos\\" are newly remastered and the sound quality is excellent. You also get four downloads of live shows, but it seems that two of them have already been released on \\"Alive in America\\". As for the rare live material on the downloads and the cd's, you are getting high quality material, mostly from '79, '80 and '86, which is indispensable.  Also, you get three fairly good songs originally recorded for the \\"Teachers\\" soundtrack, one of which evolved into \\"Shadow Warrior\\".
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is was an awesome action packed movie. We totally loved it. It was so cool watching all these superheros work together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love Love Love this game! It's awesome!!! Kiloo is awesome! He's #1! I wish all the other people who make games could be as cool as Kiloo. ( My name is really Maycie. I'm 11 years old. My dad's name is Ben Clark. My best friend's name is Angeline.)
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|If you don't mind constant cussing and crude talk this movie is for you. Some of the scenes are really funny and many others a pretty dumb.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Loved this until my phone broke and I sent them an email asking if there was any way to get my game save back on my new phone (same make and model as last one). Never heard back, nothing just silence.  I'm  thankful i only spent a couple bucks on it at least. Fix your customer support
B004ADH1RI|5.0|After all these years, it's still so good! I love this movie so much. I recommended to everyone who likes fun movies.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Only someone that has been in their position would understand the nature of this movie. Thank God we have men in uniform that are willing to chance death to complete their objective. Act Of Valor is a movie based on a simulation of what these men do for a living, not fact. A few people have viewed this movie as a poor example of what they do AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME, BECAUSE LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS ! ;-)
B00498SDN0|5.0|After all these years, it's still so good! I love this movie so much. I recommended to everyone who likes fun movies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the third season and the ONLY place I could find it.!! Outstanding series on BBC originally.  D. K.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|This movie was good and got you involved emotionally which I like when that happens. The story line is also very good as well. A bit too sadism at times though. I'm not much a sadistic person.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this application.  not sure I totally understand what all I am supposed to do but I like what it does<br /><br />Irish I had a real. horsey of my very lend
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It was well written, and maintained tension throughout. Fortunately had a happy ending! Hope this doesn't happen in real life.
B00B10DZQE|1.0|I like surfing, and this movie is worthless.  This movie is way too cliche, and way too long.  2 minutes at the end could have summed this up.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Game is great and bug free.  Been playing this every day now for the last week and haven't come close to exploring all the features.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great quality and very affordable.  My grandchildren and I absolutely loved to watch the movies in our Blu-ray player.  It was nice to relive the magic with them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Time magazine was correct in calling this book &#34;the best book of 2012&#34;.  It is a heartbreakingly beautiful must-read.  Stop reading this review and start reading the book...
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy looking at facebook on my kindle.  It is more better than going to the computer to view facebook friends.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just love this show I'm additcted.  Glad its available on Amazon Prime as I can' get it on Netfilx.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is prett good i would love to see some real harder competitions please otherwise its a great game.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Even though this is A Barbie Doll it looks more like Katniss than other more expensive figures. I am an adult collector so this will not be played with. The detail is very good and the doll is beautiful. I recommend it for anyone who is A fan of the movies and books.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Item came in great condition. Loved the show, thought it was a good visualization of the classic Frank Miller comic. The violence what not as intense, but that is a good thing. Loved Peter Weller as the voice of Batman. The animation was good and clean, the whole two part series flowed very well. I would highly reccomend it to any batman enthusiast also. It will be in the forefront of my collection.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I don't know about any of the other reviewers but I could tell you that when I received mine in installed I had absolutely no issues whatsoever. This product just works.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|This movie surprised me which is why I had to buy it. I am not a fan of Channing Tatum, but he was very good in this movie. It was very funny and the story was very well done. I loved the cameo of DeLuis and Depp!!! This was so much better than the Starsky and Hutch, Bewitched, and Miami Vice fiascos.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Brilliant game for horse lovers and animal lovers, realistic horses. Good games in game and fun. Gems could be easier to get though.
0425263916|5.0|Loved it. But so mad that the 3rd crossfire isn't coming out til June, that is just wrong I will never read another series book until all of them are out.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Just an okay movie.  It has good action and the plot moves along nicely, but I thought the original movie with Arnold was much better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to play with my 4 year old. And my 11 year old loves these virtual pet games and this one seems very legit and beautiful graphics.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Does what it says. Everyone with an iPhone should have one. Protects and provides peace of mind about your smart phone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much. It is one of my favourite games. I love all the tasks and I love my two horses Zendella and Mandy.
B007TVANDM|4.0|This book is colorful and cute - perfect for my two year old daughter who loves singing the song.<br /><br />Jackie
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun it is just very hard to get to the next level other then that this is a fun game you all should download nightclub story. Other then that have a nice night
0395389496|5.0|We have used this story for years in our school and the students love coming into their seats and having a bell and hot chocolate sitting on their desks.  It brings the magic of Christmas to all of them.  I bought this book to bring that same magic to my grandkids.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. My highest score is 4,000,000. I play it every day right when I get up. If you love the first temple run you will love this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this and I LOVED IT! I only downloaded it on my Kindle fire because my sister has it on her iPod touch. At first, I didn't know how to work it, so I personally thought it was a rip off and I should delete it. But I really started practicing and I figured it out. Throughout my day my eyes were glued to Temple Run on my Kindle! I got enough coins to unlock Scarlett Fox (she was 5000) and Barry Bones (he was 15000). I am working on unlocking Karma Lee (she's 25000 coins).  Guy Dangerous is the free one, you start out with him. The only thing I don't like about it is, if you bump into something the monster magically catches up with you and appears behind you. Great game though! Rate this if it was helpful.
B001Q2U5B0|2.0|didn't even finish watching this movie.<br /><br />Ashton might be appropriate in some films but with this one, the plot of the movie is not very good to start and Ashton makes it even worse.
0061730335|5.0|With very little but cast off items, a need for his family and later his community, with a little knowledge and lots of ingenuity and curiosity, this boy made a big difference.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This app is awesome, it keeps me up to date with news all over the world that the US doesn't give.  It keeps me up to date with class issues.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good action as always.  Stunts weren't too ridiculous for the most part, and enjoyed seeing Simon Pegg have a bigger role.
0545128285|5.0|I got this for a fellow Potter fan and was thrilled with it.  I love that their stories don't have that sweet happy ending and it has the Peveral brothers in it as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was better than the movie! I can definitely see myself reading it again!! A must read! Could not put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my son is 5 and loves to play this new game.  It makes him think and problem solve. basic but neat
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Brother is a nature/history buff and he just loved this in his stocking.  Great gift and great product.  Thanks - very nice transaction!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show has as many twists and turns as a mountain road. They leave you hanging, but always full-fill with the next show. Well worth the watch.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love this and the specials are wonderful! Any fan of the show will enjoy owning this and I highly recommend it!
B000007492|5.0|Very excellent collection of songs. As with most albums, there are a few that are not as good as the others, but a great collection.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love this set and the price was awesome!  Any fan of the show will enjoy owning this! Would also make a great gift!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a great read! Liked it better than the movie. I would recommend it for people who enjoy adventure and fantasy.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|If you like hidden object games this game has a lot of them. The hidden object scenes are fun but the game is too short and the story line is too simple.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and parents! My son watched this on a road trip and loved it. Really cute movie and it actually kept me laughing too.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|I loaned this DVD to a friend and never got it back, so I bought another. I will put it on to listen to the music if I am busy, it is so tranquil. A documentary of humanity without words, stunning in its imagery and informative for those interested in the many remarkable cultures around our world. It is candy for the eyes and the soul. This is hands down my favorite DVD. I will never loan it again.
B007Y612KA|5.0|The movie was very good I thought the way they used an earlier movie style and blinded it with modern graphics was creative. The story line could have been better, but over all it kept me watching
B00BESKTMG|3.0|We really wanted to see this movie after all the marketing hype.  The previews really sold the movie.  As soon as the movie began, I new I made a mistake. The narrator's speech (by RZA)was unintelligible.  His thick accent made it hard to understand the story.  The story had much promise and all the acting was well done, except for RZA's acting.  Lastly, the editing was poorly done.  The best thing about kung fu movies is the fight scene.  The fight scenes in this movie were too close and too quickly edited.  RZA attempted to go Old School in style but utilized new techniques in action sequences (which I find more distracting than entertaining.)  The music was well done.  Hopefully he does another movie and a) doesn't cast himself. b) uses choreography for his fight scenes. and c)does another good sound track.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|The vocal tracks work great with the boss battles. Making them memorable,especially with the lyrics involved. Must have if you loved those boss battles themes.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is one of the most compelling shows I  have ever watched. Enjoy the storyline, suspense and numerous twists.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic book! Couldn't put it down, First book in a long time that had so many great plot twists!<br />Would recommend for all ages!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was captivated the entire time I was reading this book. Extremely touching and well-done. This is probably my favorite Nicholas Sparks novel - by far.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Factual, yet readable.  Helps to understand how North Korea got to be how it is and what North Koreans are going through.  Helps make world news reports more meaningful.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I am very happy to have this software available to put on my new android phone to keep it protected from viruses.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the best show on TV right now. Its great to be able to watch a show when you miss it on TV for just $1.99.
B000089RV6|5.0|I bought this for my husband.......he loves it.  It came in great shape and he is still enjoying it today.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my sises love it whenever they get thier hands on my kindle they drain the battery playing and they take it out of my room and hide it because they love it so much over al pleased thumbs up
B003QCCS36|5.0|Came in great condition! Come on, it's Ray LaMontagne, need I say more? His music is always great to listen to!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Loved the great old-school references, and feeling like getting to know Bond.<br />Also, thought they did a good job not going over-the-top with the sex, as with previous Bond movies.<br /><br />Had trouble with the video quality during the first 1/3 of the movie, but improved over time.<br />My local network speed was fine (over 20MB/sec) so was a problem upstream at Amazon.
B00008BXJG|5.0|I bought this for my husband.......he loves it.  It came in great shape and he is still enjoying it today.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Amazon should be paying the consumer to unload this hunk of garbage.  CGI worthy of PS1,  dialogue  from the worst anime,  action as lifeless as a corpse.  This movie was guaranteed to make money because it was done so cheap. Would give quarter star if I could.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Easily understood directions. Makes me eager to complete editing. Amazon's program for publication is tops. Hope to have one of my manuscripts Kindle ready soon.
030788743X|5.0|I bought this for my son(s) after listening to the audiobook because they don't/won't listen to audiobooks. We all love the story in this book. I've read and listened to it multiple times already. Highly recommended...
B006M7JCC2|5.0|One of the best NDE books at delving into the lessons learned from the other realm & conveying our true purpose here. Lots to digest and take to heart! I loved it, plan to read it again & learn from the perspectives offered. Thank you for this treasure, Anita!
0142402753|4.0|This is a lovely story and my 3.5 yr old son found lots of humor here.<br />While it still doesn't compare to our fave (Gruffalo's Child)<br />I'm happy with this purchase.<br />I like the idea of sharing what we have with those in need, the thank you note is a nice touch at the end because it supports manners and the practice of writing thank you notes, so we're happy with it.
1878424319|5.0|A great example of how to live ones life happily and affect those around us positively.  Not the best writer in the world but gets the point across to allow you to change your life if you're open to it.
0142403873|5.0|This is my favorite of Julia Donaldson's writings...<br />my son loves it too, though he prefers the Gruffalo's Child over the Gruffalo.  (I think he identifies with the kid.)<br />I do recommend purchasing it.<br />I found it clever and funny.<br />If you haven't read either book, I suggest you do it in order: Gruffalo first, then Gruffalo's Child.<br />We also enjoy Julia Donaldson's other tales.
0807014273|5.0|A literal must ready for ANYBODY.  One of the best books I have ever read, and makes you look at your life differently.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|This never loses it appeal.  Paul Simon is a master.  Check your local listings for a PBS special on the making of Graceland.  You will NOT be disjointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I got it and it was so fun I got addicted me and my friends challenge each other
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is a very realistic movie of 007. A bit sad at the end but it is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. Bond women are increfibly sexy. We finally see some of thetraining for a 007. The bad guy was great. Wonderful acting. Reminded me of the joker from batman.
B00136NUG6|5.0|classic...good compilation of hits<br />got it at a reduced price<br /><br />enjoying every minute of the music...takes me back to the past.<br />awesome music!
B00BESCJII|5.0|Fantastic movie. Actors and story is aregreat. Defintely a feel good movie. Wish I could have seen this movie when I was in highschool.
B000V63BN6|5.0|classic...good compilation of hits<br />got it at a reduced price<br /><br />enjoying every minute of the music...takes me back to the past.<br />awesome music!

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Better than some of the other games that have come out lately. worked great on kindle fire
B000JML7EC|5.0|This was a very intertaining book.  I love reading it.  Just good all around product.  I have read it several times.
B0029NY9EE|4.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers.  Since this was a free download, I thought this would be a good way to start with my Kindle.  I really havent' gotten into it yet though.  I do think it is cool to have all of Austen's works at my fingertips, once I get the hang of how to actually indulge in this device.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This was a very intertaining book.  I love reading it.  Just good all around product.  I have read it several times.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, large screen, and an excellent price (free),it turns a tablet into a basic calculator.  Nothing fancy, just a calculator when you need it.
B002RKSZN0|5.0|This was a very intertaining book.  I love reading it.  Just good all around product.  I have read it several times.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The book is far better than the movie or play.  If you love the play and want to understand the characters background and motivation, reading the book is a must.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I just found out about this band a few weeks ago when they won their first Grammy. I literally saw a picture of them and thought the singer looked bad ass (I love female fronted bands). Anyway I listened to Love Bites on You Tube and decided to buy the whole album. It's fantastic! Lzzy Hale is one of the best rock singers I've ever heard. I found out they also toured with another one of my favorite bands, Evanescence and have been compared to them as well but I disagree. Halestorm is kind of a throwback to 80's hair metal as far as sound but much more heavy. Lzzy's voice is just incredible, her vocals on Love Bites are certainly not the best of her, she actually has quite a range. I was completely surprised when I heard the ballads on this record, her voice is perfect. Although I love every single song on this record some of my favorites are Love Bites (my intro to Halestorm), Mz. Hyde (no better song to hear Lzzy's amazing range), Miss the Misery (I relate to that song in a very strange way), Break In (hands down one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard), American Boys (sounds so Southern Rock and a little bit country to me, which I love, in fact if Lzzy could do a country record that would be amazing!). By the way Lzzy is not the only one in this band with amazing talent, her brother Arejay is one hell of a drummer.
B0063GORYU|4.0|If you enjoy playing Spider on the PC, this game is an excellent copy.  For the price (free), it is well worth the download.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Bravo! First rate! What a fantastic story! I could not put it down. Good interaction between characters. The story flowed nicely and the techno jargon was not an issue at all. Looking forward to more stories like this fromn Mr. Weir!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far, Walking Dead never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat. Love this season as much as the previous ones. I can't wait to see what they do with the second half of the season!
0545265355|4.0|It's pretty good.  I loved the first book but I found Collins subject a bit too depressing towards the end of the last.  I understand what she was trying to say in the last book but did she really need to wind it up the way she did?  It's worth reading though and it looks as if the films will be good too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|What a wonderful book....  I now wish that the movie was more close to the actual story.  I will share this book with all our grand kids.
0375507256|5.0|All great.  Much better than the film.  Just great.  Hmm have to add another three words to the review. Brilliant
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome because well, everything's awesome!I like this game because their is a lot of cool prizes!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is so cool I love it I own horses but whennim not able to go outside I have my kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend told me about this game, so I downloaded it and I installed it. When I first played it, I thought that it was so addictive. Subway Surfers is the awesomest game in the whole world! You can upgrade to different zones, get new characters, and upgrade power-ups. It's so awesome!!!!!:)
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked the movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat when it was suppose to. Could have done away with the nude scene at the beginning. Overall a good movie. I'd watch it again.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game. Try it you will enjoy it. Once you STARTED to play the game, you will never want to stop. It's so addicting
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is a really nice book. I am in the second grade and I think it is a really cool book.
B001I45UFC|5.0|A friend told me about this book and I suggested that my daughter should read it and loved it.<br />There is nothing bad about the book. I love the British Accent used in the book very similar to the setting of the book. And it also has History in it about the World War 2 and how they had to move while the soldiers stayed to fight. Read This Book
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I always have loved this program.  Very helpful for staying informed and communicating new ideas.  I use it all the time.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruno Mars is an absolute stand out artist. His music has flavors of Motown, Rock, and R&B, and you can really feel the fun he has performing these songs when you listen to them. This album really delivers.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Was a nice movie including the theme of father-son healing.  It's entertaining, a little bizarre at times, but worth it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The number of radio stations available on this app are mind bogging!  The pro app, as of 2/26, is working and installing with no problem.  The differance in the pro is you can record shows, which I wanted to do, and works well. Save your money on all those other radio apps and try this one first!<br />Before I got this I paid for Hockey radio, a police scanner, and a NOAA radio app, and this one does it all. Save your money, I should have just got this one. I can tune in my county police scanner,tune in any NHL hockey game, and listen to my local weather on the NOAA channel that is near me, all on this app. Additionally I searched Dragnet and found every episode in addition to radio detectives and found any old radio radio show I wanted too. This to me, as a radio enthusist, is the best app available for the kindle fire. Would give it 10 stars if I could.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app all the time and love how it syncs with all my devices.  Couldn't pick a better one.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I received both the Blu-Ray package and LP set of Celebration Day for Christmas. LP package came in February. They all arrived in perfect condition. The sound and video quality were excellent, yes the video shots do jump around every 4 seconds or less, but this is a very minor distraction. I do wish they would have played more songs but  what they did play  covered  Led Zeppelin quite well. Two songs from the Presence album (For Your Life and Nobody' Fault But Mine) prove once again that this album has always been underrated. The light show and emotional impact of the music in this show are off scale in my opinion. For anyone who has never given Led Zeppelin much of a listen this will make you listen a lot more.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.  Liam Neeson is great in this pic (as he is others).
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I love the whole underworld thing. I got it because I didn't have this movie but I did have the others so. I go It to finish off my set.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and is mostly kid friendly.  Definitely fun and inspiring as well.  I would watch again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it its like having my own pet horse...I love the pet expierence..the competitions seem surreal and the horse is so friendly..
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This a great movie including mother-daughter healing dynamics.  I has inspired several friends of mine to begin their family of origin work in therapy.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the graphics, music, voices &amp; storyline.  Spooky without being too scarey for kids.  Good length playing time.  After playing this &quot;Epic Adventure &quot;, I will be searching for other &quot;Epic Adventure &quot; games!  Worth the price I paid!
B008220C56|2.0|From the beginning the artifice of the staging began to annoy me.  My criticism is in no way an attack on the caliber of performance but the lack of momentum in the story, the editing was awful - in short what was going to be an incredibly powerful story about real people, with raw passion and the timelessness of performances playing off each other - simply did not happen.<br />This is a classic love story which could be played by actors in rehearsal clothes - but instead we got an emphasis on costumes, sets and a sense that every sequence was too long.  I found myself saying 'cut' - I got it - next scene please.<br />Highly unrecommendable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I got hooked reading the Hunger Games series because they were on a used Kindle I bought so I had to get the last book. Without spoiling the ending I will say it was not what I expected. From the storyline I had two distinct ideas of how it would end and I was surprised to read the final chapters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this  book! I could not put it down and the ending is fantastic. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is really good. way better than the first one! !! I love it! !!! characters look different than first one. great
145551389X|5.0|Granddaughter loves it & that is all that matters. So what else can I say but enough to get the minimum words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Learned about this game from a friend and haven't stopped playing it since. Fast paced and challenging. I recommend it highly.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|I love the idea of owning this \\"upgrade\\" but after it was installed, my light either flickers or doesn't work. Majority of the times That i turn my light on it just doesn't work. In theory the light would be cool but I am very disappointed in this product.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|Really enjoy this somewhat unique take on the blues.  Ben's vocalizations vary nicely to suit the songs, Charlie's harp playing drops in wonderfully, more like another singer than an instrumentalist.  Great stuff!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Story line was great but movie was slow paced and cinematography was amateurish. I am being generous in my rating because of the media hype but it was not a story well told.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A local book club chose this; otherwise, I wouldn't have read it. But once I started, I was captivated by the originality and integrity of his report. Long ago I gave up on the idea of Heaven because the Fundamentalist Christian church of my youth used it as a weapon, and the god they spoke about, so full of judgment and shame, was not one I cared to spend time with.  Since then, my experiences of profound grace have shown me another reality, a Presence of Love beyond my wildest dreams. Dr. Alexander's NDE resonated with my heart, opening a closed door I didn't realize was closed.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Loved the game. Great hint feature. The scenes were clear, but still dificult enough to be enjoyable. Great sound effects.
B007V4530A|5.0|This book is clear and concise. The author covers all the important elements of a presentation without wasting the reader's time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle and my Android.  When my husband is on the android playing the games or checking out the apps, , I'm on my Kindle  reading.  Love this app thank you
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Milla Jovovich definitely delivers in this movie.  The action is intense, and may make you jump at a few parts.  New enemy's to worry about, and something new is discovered about the virus.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Everyone who has lived with and loved cats will certainly relate to this..  , I could imagine any one of mine being the author
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome<br />I play installs day long. It has some cool graphics.<br />You need to get this app ASAP<br />Xavier Ali Williams<br /><br />The only way I can tell the truth of this game is better than Temple run
0393327655|5.0|Superstition rules the Earth, people are afraid of death so they invent a shangrala in the sky. people kill for religion. Read Harris book and find out why.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Thanks to having Facebook in my life,  I am able to keep<br />current. events with my children. Friends, Partners in crime.lol<br />Have caught. Up with ole school mates from 30yrs ago.<br />It is sooo versitile.<br />I have looked up companies etc.<br />Not to mention love the newsfeed,  look forward to it a couple<br />of times a day.<br />Don't know how we got along with out it?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the movie.  Five stars.  Now want to read the book.  That,s all I want to write, why are you requiring more words?
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I needed to keep account. for everything,  this did the job.<br />Others too complicated, just needed the good ole one.<br />Although this can do so many verses.<br /><br />Check this out you will not be disappointed!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is a hunt and find. You can never know where the objects will be. This is a great game.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Although this is a prequel, you are assured to get more from this book if you read it after the Maze Runner Trillogy. It clarifies some questions, while introducing new characters for us to get to know.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Only complaint I have is, not being able to plug my Kindle into the charger unless it's a certain way.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was an amazing video. A must see for any man, husband, or father.<br />Lots of action, real issues, and real answers.
B009P5S11G|5.0|LOVE THIS ALBUM WHO EVERY EVERY DON'T HAVE IT NEED TO GET IT. IT COME WITH SNEAK PEAK OF LOUD TOUR DVD
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I bought this pack thinking there would be extra scenes like you can buy at target or Walmart because of how much it was, but this combo pack doesn't include anything special, just the movie. Mediocre.
B0055SWM08|5.0|What's not to like about Quell? It's certainly intellectually challenging, &amp; the music and sounds let you think in peace. I've always loved lateral thinking puzzles, and here's a big m batch of them! Very Zen!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Have you ever heard the phrase \\"easy a baby can wade through but an elephant can drown in\\" when the person talk about books/stories. That is this book.<br /><br />Maybe because my friends in high school were like the ones Charlie hung out with or maybe it's because I'm a watcher like Charlie but I had a connection with this book even though I didn't have near the same experience.<br /><br />Charlie seemed real with all that he described because he could see people as they were and could understand them. He put himself before everyone else just so they could have an easier time even when it emotionally hurt him on the inside.<br /><br />I read this book all in one day because it was hard to put down and stay away from it. It made you think and pounder what he was talking about. I recommend anyone to read this if they want something deeper to understand. (And it is pretty different from the movie but similar in some ways as well. Try to watch the movie first)
B009VMN3RA|5.0|excellent book, very well-written.  Sashi is extremely likeable & much more forgiving of her \\"parents\\" than I wdve been.  Some of the stories were almost unbelievable but who am I to say they didn't happen.  Considering Sashi practically raised herself, I think she did an excellent job.  It's too bad Shirley didn't think of adoption when she decided to dump Sashi.  This book held my interest and is definitely worth reading.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|I bought this app because I needed one that would read my E-books to me. Not happy with this one at all. First of all, it often reads the punctuation. Very annoying!! Unlike the Kindles, you have no control over the voice. This only reads with a woman. Would be nice to have the option between male or female as well as being able to control the speed of the voice. And the player buttons on the screen are so small and close together that they are very frustating to operate. I paid $3 for this app, I think a little more isn't too much to ask.<br /><br />When I send books to my Fire I'm unable to locate them even though there are folders everywhere. When I hook my Fire up to my laptop I am able to sort, organize, name, and transfer books to files very easily. But who wants to go through all that? I'd really like to do that directly on the Fire. It doesn't have a very user friendly feel to it and there is no guide that I've found.<br /><br />I only need it for the voice reading so until you improve that it's useless to me as it is now. I've got my eye out in the meantime for s replacement and for now I have to continue listening to my trusty 'ol keyboard Kindle.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book! I wouldn't describe it as a sequel because its been almost a hundred years since the last one. Fantastic character. Great story line. Interesting details about architecture, priests and nuns, greed and ambition!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really like this game. I need friends so anyone who wants to add me go right ahead look for NicelyMetal328
B009FZHYKU|2.0|the walking dead is by far my absolute favorite show, so I have no complaints on the content, but I ordered episode 1 of season 3 (not in HD) and it froze up about 7 times. I had to restart a few times. I don't know if HD is different, but I would go with HD if you're going to watch a movie/series on Amazon instant.<br />other than that, wonderful service, and was downloaded within 2 minutes
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Got into the first 2 books but wish I didn't have to read the third book.  Story could have been condensed but still love it. Not for everyone--
B008IJT0CE|4.0|advertises 92 but i only get 88. great sounds for sleeping. my baby loves the humming which isnt on the free...plus on the premium, u can have it in the background on ur kindle fire.
B008Y1YK9Y|2.0|My nephews and I are big fans of the Men In Black films, at least the first two.  We were a bit disappointed at this third one.  We missed it at the theaters so we were anxious for the DVD release.<br /><br />Besides being thoroughly grossed out a couple of times and tempted to shut it off and switch to something else, we stayed with it to the end.  We struggled to stay connected to the film throughout, however.  There was a lot more dialog and the witty comebacks between the main characters just seemed to fall short of their mark.  The actors were excellent and did their best, but this version was a bit of a disappointment.  There was action, but the tempo or pace of the film seemed off.  The special effects were incredible, as expected.<br /><br />We'll be adding the DVD to our permanent collection as we already have the other two, but I don't see it getting watched a lot in the future.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|the premium version allows you to play sounds in the background on your kindle fire while letting you do other things on your kindle. if u like the free version...i think its worth the upgrade...and i rarely pay for apps.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|This drama-mystery is superb!! One of the best movies I have seen! The plot and storyline is excellent and edgy paired with outstanding acting. Highly Recommend!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A great action adventure. Well done and I plan on purchasing many More in the series. Going to old-fashioned page
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you liked Cranford you will love this.  Nothing is as good as Downton in my eyes but this show is really cute.  It is a bit more whimsical than Downton and a bit more like a quality soap opera (if there ever was one).  Make sure to watch an episode before bed and you will be sure to dream as if you lived in the 18th century!
B004TI5N38|3.0|He builds a fine storyline, fills the characters well but then ending was a let down. It was still a worthwhile read and I will kindle more of his books.
B005I7G3EM|4.0|Not one of John Wayne's best but a fair movie not much action story Line is slow but watchable the scenery was good
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is a thriller spy movie in which Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent who develops a plan to rescue six American diplomatic agents that are hiding in the Canadian embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. If they are captured they will be killed as spies. The plan is risky and dangerous and getting into the country and back out is very difficult.<br /><br />Tony is asked to review all of the plans put forth by the CIA and they are simply a joke and he rips them apart. He comes up with a plan that he thinks is brilliant but his bosses think his ideas are crazier than their own plans. With things escalating in Iran and every second counting they agree to go ahead with his plan but there is one caveat. He has to lead and be the front man in the mission and go into Iran.....<br /><br />This is a very good film and it provides an insight into some of the secret missions that our government and the CIA are involved in. Ben Affleck just shines in this movie and he is truly becoming a great lead actor. He also directed the movie and it is quite an achievement. If you like suspense and dramatic movies then this one is for you.<br /><br />As you know the movie is based on a true story and it is nice to hear the truth (As Hollywood likes to tell it) about how the six diplomats got out of Iran. In summary this is a good movie with a good cast and I recommend it to you. You should enjoy it as it is an interesting and gripping story.<br /><br />I do think that the cooperation and bravery of the Canadian government and of the Canadian Embassy was downplayed a lot and they should have been more recognized in the film as real heroes and supporters of America during those tough times.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A little too short for the cost, but it had a  good story. Enjoyed the hidden pictures and mini games.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Unf. If you dig MGR:R, you'll definitely love the soundtrack, and here it is.<br /><br />A+ buy for any Revengence Fan.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Yes I bought this case for my father. He is 87 years old. He has enjoy his new kindle fire and his new care
B009G78EE2|5.0|I really love this album. Thrift shop is the only song that I believe is meant to be funny. The rest is pretty serious. You cannot beat it for 4 dollars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 books on my kindle. They were exciting and a very fun read. I recommend all 3 books.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED THE GRAPHICS, SIMPLICITY AND INTERACTING WITH MY GRANDKIDS.  HOWEVER, I WAS QUITE ADVANCED IN THE GAME (5 ISLANDS, NUMEROUS ISLANDS AND HABITATS) WHEN IT RESET TO THE BEGINIG.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RECOVER WHERE I WAS.  CAN YOU HELP ME?
B003EDYWDQ|5.0|I love Yundi and his classic music.Hope I will go to a concert of him one day. Thanks him for bringing classic piano to my life.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is great. I play it almost all day, off and on. It isn't really an interactive game, so much as a monitor one. You set it to make food for the customers, and check back later. There are lots of neat decorations, but the drawback is that they are kind of expensive, in fake money, or you have to pay real money to get them sooner than you would just playing. However if you don't mind taking your time to decorate or upgrade, it's a great game. Would recommend it to people who have lots of time and patience.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like this game.  However I do not find some of the puzzle pictures very interesting and have skipped many of the puzzles thus far.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|As series go - All I can say is - I didn't believe it.<br />Please stop now - do not pass go - do not collect $200 !!!<br />Do not make another...
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|It lagged while on home network and I couldn't use it outside of my house. The Logmein app is much better.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|a great young cast!  Great to see the characters devolved.<br />The unexpected romance made sense once you realized<br />an alternate universe has come into the picture.<br />Really enjoyed the story telling!
B00846F1YW|5.0|skipped through much of the story line but many scenes are challenging even the second orthird time through. good graphics and some of thecharacters are a little on the creepy side.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|We loved it!  Very well rendered!  Excellent attention to continuity and detail.<br />The minions were great!  The girls adorable!  Loved it!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|helps pass hours in Airports and planes; a new challenge with every start: no need to worry about download speeds
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it's a great challenge but when I changed the graphics to best it wouldn't let me play so I uninstalled it and now it won't let me reinstall it
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|If you know Jonas Kaufmann you are already a fan.  If you don't go to track 3 and listen.  Maybe the voice will survice the horrible mps download - a cultural crime.  The track is enough to make you cry: such a beautiful voice, so controlled and yet free, and let's face it, such a beautiful man.<br /><br />The acoustic is overly reverbarant, too sonically enhanced for me.  But please don't let that stop you.  If you think you hate Wagner, hate opera, if this one doesn't do it for you.  Well, I'd try Placido Domingo's duet's album with Deborah Voight, also excellent.  Otherwise, you are lost to beauty.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Nice job, it works, price was right, love to to bus., again with you. . Thanks Again. Keep your stars coming!!!

B00A80SHFM|5.0|after i saw les mis in a movie theatre, i soon after ordered this cd, and the purchase was totally worth it !! i really love it and listen to it all the time. i even have my dad walking around singing the songs- though with hilarious mistakes on the lyrics, haha ! if you liked the movie and like the songs, the money is definitely worth it.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Every book that Riordan writes is better than the one before it!  This book has a treacherous ending!  It makes me want to buy the next book in the series!  I have loved every book that Riordan writes, but this one was by far the best!  He seems to know that his readers are growing up and is making each book more dark and twisty and romantic.  I was so not expecting Annabeth and Percy to fall into Tarturus together, an unexpected twist.  If you like romance, action, and adventure stories, this book is right up your alley.  I'd suggest this book for anyone who likes fantasy or if you like books with lots of wars in them.  I loved this book and am waiting in anticipation for the House Of Hades to come out.  Go, Riordan!
1449410243|5.0|If you're familiar with The Oatmeal (aka Matthew Inman), then you're familiar with this book's style and probably already own or wish you owned this book. Some comics are repeats from his site, but most are new, and all have to do with cats. Cat thoughts, cat plots, cats as office workers, etc.  I actually don't care much for the office worker Bobcats, and there are quite a few pages devoted to them, but I still lol'd at almost this entire book.  It also includes a poster at the end, and I have no idea how you could possibly go wrong getting a book of hilarious cat comics and a poster for under $10.<br /><br />(Warning though: some bad language, so not for the kids. It's not overdone though and always used for humor's sake. But still, if your kids can read, you might want to hold off on showing them the funny pictures.)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good story, believable.  The ending moved so fast that it was confusing on my first reading.  I.A. timely appearance stretched believability a bit.
0307346617|4.0|I haven't read Zombie Survival Guide yet, so, although the Guide is mentioned several times in this book, I can't compare the two.  I can say that this book is very detailed and well thought out, to the point that you almost believe it was really written from eye-witness accounts.  Though it's intended to be transcriptions of oral history interviews, the majority of it reads like it was always intended to be a movie script, or at least more like prose than like real people speaking.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it did keep my disbelief suspended only about a few inches above the pages.  (That being said though, it doesn't look like the movie based on this book is going to follow the book very closely; those movie zombies move dang fast, and Brad Pitt looks like he's in the thick of the action, not an interviewer/author. *shrug*)<br /><br />A lot of the characters seemed really similar too. This may have been intentional, with everyone having gone through similarly terrible things during the war, but I kind of doubt it.  I can't say that the book was boring for this reason though; the stories and the detail made up for it and kept me interested. I'll probably go back and read the Guide soon.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Tedious in many spots but still has a Scarpetta feel to it.  The ending is only adequate. Wouldn't recommend it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|What an amazing book! There is so much depth and you are drawn into very familiar stories and events from history that focus on habits that caused them to occur. It is amazing to see the formula our brain uses to get us to repeatedly do an action (smoke, gamble, lie, eat, compete, ect.). I definitely think everyone should read this book for the fascinating stories alone.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Great performances by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, as usual. This is an interesting slice of Hollywood life during the making of Psycho. Anyone into either of the stars, movies, history of movies, history of LA would enjoy it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I love this series of Bond, Skyfall fits perfectly with the others.  We get to see another side of Bond which was never show before.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Other than the villain being brilliantly played, the rest of the movie was really quite boring. The storyline was kinda bad, and the action totally lacking. Too bad.
0345803485|1.0|This book reads like someone's kinky fantasy world, and is so redundant I wound up skimming through the repetitive (supposedly erotic) sex scenes, hoping the sick lovers would at least explain themselves. The author never bothers to fill the reader in on what drives the main characters, until finally (and uncharacteristically) the female character decides to leave after she's asked the guy to hurt her, he complies, and she twigs that he's messed up. Well, duh! The book ends without answering a thing, unless you (like me) find yourself wondering if they're going to stay together. Save your money: they don't, and they never resolve a thing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Except that you cannot write directly on the screen, this is the best note taking app I've tried. I use it on my Kindle,  my smartphone,  and my laptop. All of my notes, drawings, web clips, and copies go here and are updated in the &quot;cloud&quot;, and appear on any device. If I have any trouble printing anything,  I copy it into Evernote, and print from there. Evernote's the best way to copy and find web pages and copy photos from the Web. I also use it for medical reviews which I take to my doctor...no misplaced paper.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. Overall, I liked the movie and thought it was worth watching.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I am very happy with this PDF reader.  I use the product in the field to mark up PDF's.  Love it
B009BJAPLK|4.0|than the one on CBS right now.  It's a story like a story should be.  It has its own character's idiosyncracies, flavors, and pace.  You know you'll have to watch each episode again not because its that good, but because you want to soak up everything again and rediscover anything you've missed.  It doesn't come in its own pre-packaged box.  It comes on a big ole trash can lid for you to rummage through to delight in whatever you want, whenever you want.
1935251740|2.0|I find the ideas that Lanza presents spot on, but his writing is annoying to the point that I'd rather just skip on to someone else's better exposition of the same concepts. I can't recommend this book.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I found an issue one time. It wasn't charging for some reason but it was fixed somehow after a few hours. I will revisit this review if it happens again.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|a challenging search and solve game. thinking and reasoning needed, but not an impossible game to think through. highly recommend this game.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Used our Roku box and had no streaming or buffering issues with watching this great documentary. Two big thumbs up!!
B007REV4T8|2.0|I heard good things about this movie so lots of other people liked it. I didn't.  The movie arrived quickly, was in new condition but I just didn't care for it.  It seems like with each new movie, the storyline gets more far-fetched and outlandish with more implausible action.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|seems fun my friend has it but look @ the price its nuts. hope I find a game like this for free
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I call this style of show a comic strip drama.  One has to suspend one's disbelief button and just go with the flow.  Science, quantum theory, action, good looking people, story with good timing, and good acting make this series very palatable fare.  Insane characters have the most sensitivity and the government officials have none (of course).  So that makes it a very true to life drama.<br />When one is not ready for &#34;substance&#34; and needs to vedge, this would be good.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a thrilling and tense retelling of the Iran hostage incident that really makes you pull for the American's and their challenge to free the hostages, and hate nefarious Iran. Constant tension throughout the film. We watch as the stage is set for the hostage-taking from conception to execution to free them. The brilliant escape plan: Argo, was in itself an engaging and authentic characterization of a slime Hollywood and a stealthy C.I.A. merging talents. Argo is an edge of the seat film. The acting is superb. And whoever did the casting for Iranian actors should receive an Oscar because the Iranian's are complex, frightening, and genuine. Each character in Argo is awesome, right up to Alan Arkin's character who is witty and scheming with an Allen Arkin Go *%$# attitude. I didn't see any special effects or CGI, at least where it jumps off the screen and declares itself phony. The cinematography and location shots did include a few archived news clips in some of the early scenes but without that tarnished grainy appearance, so none of that mattered or diverted from Argo's dramatic story. I think you will enjoy this movie and very early on realize that you're glad you chose to watch it.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I was so excited to read this book because it was (obviously) the latest Bosch novel and I would be completely up to date. I know a lot of reviews get real technical but I just like Bosch as a character so I would suggest buying this book if you have enjoyed any of the previous Bosch novels. I just hope no one makes these into movies, not even any cameos in any future Mickey Haller stories because I have a mental image of these characters that I don't ever want to get spoiled like what happened with Jack Reacher. I'd be crushed under the disappointment of a character choice that I didn't agree with. Not that anyone would want my opinion on that. Anyhow, it's a good story just like all the rest.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a really good book.  It was not predictable like i thought it would be.  A recommended read for anyone.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|WARNING SPOILERS This is one part Blade Runner, one part original Total Recall, one part Judge Dredd the original, and one part Total Recall the Tv series. They should have kept the plot the same as the original. First mistake is they made the Earth and the cities like Judge Dredd, Blade Runner, and Total Recall the Series. Earth had been mostly decimated by chemical warfare. Second mistake is they changed the plot to happen all on Earth. The technology and effects were great but they screwed it up by changing the plot.

0425263908|4.0|Has similarities to Fifty shades, but written much better. The first book sets up the story, I can't wait for the next one. Ava is not as innocent as Anna was, and is not as intimidated by Gidon. She also comes from her own money, therefore Gidon's wealth does not impress/ make her uncomfortable.  The only annoying thing is, instead of talking out their problems, they just have sex instead, as if that's the answer to all the problems. So by the end of the book you don't really find out much about their backgrounds, especially Gidon's.

1597801585|5.0|`The Windup Girl' is a terrific SF novel, which shouldn't come as a surprise since it won the Nebular (2009) and Hugo (2010) awards for best SF novel of the year. It is a thoroughly original story, exquisitely well written and highly recommended. The story is set in Bangkok, Thailand about 100 years in the future. Fossil fuels have either been depleted or abandoned to avoid further global warming. Sea level rise has inundated important population centers; Bangkok is protected from the sea by a system of massive levies. Energy is produced by muscle-power, provided either by people themselves or by genetically modified elephants and other beasts of burden. Genetically engineered plagues have decimated the world's population. Multinational food-engineering corporations in North America control the world by holding the global food supply hostage to genetically engineered blights and diseases. These \\"calorie companies\\" are scheming to subvert Thailand, which has staved off enslavement by creating its own seed bank to produce a domestic food supply resistant to the companies' weaponized plant diseases. In the middle of this is the title character, a genetically engineered, artificial girl who is despised as a subhuman creature because she was grown in a test tube and, as such, has no soul. The story unfolds as characters, including an undercover agent of one of the calorie companies, a Chinese refugee, Thai Environment Ministry police, rival government officials and Emiko, the windup girl, attempt to further their interests.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|When I started using this, I wasn't too impressed. It has since surprised me how much I use it and how much I have grown to depend on it. I'm an author and ideas occur to me at the strangest times and this enables me to jot down everything. I have also used it as a reminder list maker and a variety of other reasons. I LOVE the internet backup as I recently reset my Kindle and feared those notes gone forever. Fortunately they were right there once I signed back in. Even with any limitations it may have, I love this app.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|As with the former volumes this is definitely adult reading.  However, overall I think all the books told a good story.
0486414124|5.0|Okay, so I still love Mansfield Park (my other favorite JA), but I have to say that after reading Northanger Abbey, I now have a new #1.  By the last couple of chapters, I was reading only about two pages per day, just so I could prolong the enjoyment of reading this book.  I did not want it to end!  Northanger Abbey is wonderful on so many levels!  The richness of Austen's prose has never been more delightful than in this, her earliest work.  The humor infused throughout is gentle and affectionate, but elicits out-loud laughs on many occasions.  The setting, especially that of Northanger Abbey, is just as mysterious and intriguing as one could hope for.  And the characters!  Never has Austen presented us with such a charming and memorable cast.  Catherine Morland is my favorite heroine ever.  She is just adorable.  You cannot help but love her, with her vivid, overly-romantic imagination --- which I'm sure many of us devoted novel-readers can relate to --- and her guileless sincerity.  She is sweetly innocent, intelligent, modest, and just extremely lovable.  And Henry Tilney has got to be the best hero Austen has ever created.  I was certainly in love with him!  He is kind, clever, handsome, and intelligent.  He teases Catherine in the most affectionate of ways, yet defends her with ferocity.  I always got the sense that she was safe when he was near, and I got nervous every time he left Northanger Abbey.  The scenes between Catherine and Henry contain some of the snappiest dialogue Austen ever wrote.  They are a perfect match, to be sure.  And the supporting characters!  Talk about a female antagonist that you will love to hate!  Isabella Thorpe is really a piece of work --- one of Austen's most memorable creations.  Not to mention Isabella's brother John. He is one of those characters that makes you cringe every time he appears on the scene, because you just get the sense that he is going to cause trouble for Catherine.  General Tilney is really fascinating.  Iwon't give anything away, but let's just say that I was as mystified by him as Catherine was.  And Eleanor Tilney is really a wonderful character that doesn't get the credit she deserves.  She seems perfect --- kindhearted, loyal, beautiful, moral.  Yet she never comes off as cloying and proves herself to be the kind of true friend that Catherine longs for.<br />Northanger Abbey is a real page-turner. Austen's best work, in my opinion.  I only wish it was longer!  It is now happily residing on my \\"favorites\\" bookshelf, right alongside Mansfield Park.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|I would definitely recommend the first book to anyone that likes books like The Hunger Games or Divergent.  Very interesting concept.  The series is (again) about teenagers in a dystopian future, so the writing seems a little immature.  The first book was very compelling, but the second and third books were lackluster.  I found myself wishing there was a more exciting ending to the series.

B00275EGX8|2.0|As a professional soldier I was disappointed by this movie.  There was so much that was wrong with it.  You destroy IEDs in place, you don't disarm them.  The out of control antics would not be put up with as other soldiers would avoid such a uncontrolled character because he would get you and your buddies killed.  I just don't know what all the fuss is about this director - other than the look and feel for downrange - she got it all wrong.  This is not the definitive movie on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.

0439023513|1.0|Devastated. Betrayed. Cheated.<br /><br />These are probably just a few of the emotions I felt when I put down my Kindle after reading the very last word of this book. I spent a handful of days reading The Hunger Games, in which I quickly became immersed in this world and story created by Suzanne Collins, as well as in the character of Katniss Everdeen, a strong and determined, albeit still realistically flawed, heroine. When I finished, I read Catching Fire right away, which only solidified my passion for this series and its characters. Both stories were compelling, beautiful despite the darkness, honest amid the lies, and, above all, filled with hope.<br /><br />But now, 12 hours removed from completing Mockingjay, I still feel dazed with disbelief that an author could so thoroughly take this world and all the people in it and mutate it into something I barely recognized. The author betrayed the trust her readers had in her, and to me that's one of the most unforgivable things a writer can do.<br /><br />I understand this story is about war. The theme of the story is clear. LOUD and clear. War is bad. War can alter worlds. War can change people. But humans are amazingly resilient, as were these characters we were introduced to and cheered for in the first two books. The journey did not have to end for them the way it did. They could have found a convincing semblance of happiness had the overarcing internal theme - hope, and even love, in the face of everything that could take it away - remained. Had Collins stuck to what she originally created before she horribly lost sight of the inherent human aspects of the story, ones that made us fall in love with it in the first place, in order to send some kind of overdramatic message to her readers.<br /><br />~~SPOILERS~~<br /><br />Oh, where do I begin. I wish I could find something redeeming about this book. I really do. I tried so hard on multiple occasions, re-reading bits and pieces in hopes more words would somehowappear to make them more recognizable. I didn't want to admit to myself the story was heading in such a direction, but in the end, there wasn't a single thing with the exception of a few shimmering moments that came and went much too quickly.<br /><br />- Character Development/Disloyalty<br /><br />This was perhaps where Collins went the most astray. When I read a story, I attach to the emotional factors of it and the characters themselves - their internal conflict, how they grow, and how they respond in the face of everything happening outside themselves. By all means, I enjoy a story that emotionally tears both me and the characters to shreds, but there better be a purpose behind it and, ideally, the characters may come out altered, but they are stronger versions of themselves.<br /><br />But in this case, the internal climax and the \\"rebuilding\\" I yearned so desperately to see in all the characters never happened. It didn't happen because it COULDN'T happen, because the characters who could have overcome the war and found hope in all the grief and madness simply did not exist. And there was no good reason they could not have, at least to a point, which baffles me the most.<br /><br />In this book, the Katniss - headstrong, determined, yet conflicted Katniss - we knew ceased to grow altogether. In fact, I think it's safe to say she regressed, turning into an empty, weak shell of herself. For someone who spent the entirety of all three novels being a pawn in someone else's game, and was well aware of it most of the time, did nothing. Not once did she rise above it internally, take control of her life and her situation, and come into her own the way she claimed to want to. To show that she could think for herself. Instead, she spent half the book hiding in closets, restrained in hospitals, and pumping morphling into her system to forget all the internal conflict she really needed to face. And in the end, she was essentially exiled back to District 12 and she allowedit, rather than stick around to ensure what she was used for, fought for, and lost was not in vain.<br /><br />And then there's Peeta. Beautiful, kind, GOOD Peeta. The destruction of his character probably infuriates me more than anything. Out of all the characters in this series, he truly was my favorite. He brought balance to it. He made it light when everything seemed dark. He gave hope when everything seemed lost. He saw good in things that were evil. And Mockingjay destroyed that. It destroyed him. And for what reason?<br /><br />I understand, to a point, why - so Katniss would falter. That part was clear, and falter she did. But why? Why was it absolutely necessary? Why was the extent of Peeta's damage integral to the plot? This is never answered for me and pointless suffering doesn't sit well. Murdering a character without actually doing so DEFINITELY doesn't sit well. And to top it off, salt is poured in the wound when Katniss, with the exception of one or two all too-short moments, writes him off in a way he never would have done to her. In a way that was not true to her original character. In a way that made me lose faith in her completely.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author could have stopped short of the pointless tactic of hijacking, of taking the intimate moments - some of the best, most emotionally gripping exchanges between these two characters in the first two stories - and tainting them and him beyond repair. As a result, it played a role in sending Katniss down a path her character could have avoided. Had Peeta not been subjected to it, he could have come back in a way better than he was able to. He could have been that one ally Katniss so DESPERATELY needed in this book. His steadiness that always complimented her strength - could have provided some balance. Helped her, when it mattered most, to see the eventual good that could come from the destruction. Given her hope, the same way he always had.<br /><br />- The Pacing, Plot<br /><br />I tore through the first two books, soaking up every single word because I did not want to miss a single thing. This just wasn't the case for Mockingjay. This story was drawn out and told us so much more than it showed. I found myself skimming parts to find something compelling. For the most part, the story lacked real, convincing emotion a reader could cling to, because it was so lost in what was happening externally. Lost in technical details driving home the ins and outs of a war we barely see, one that obscured everything else and nearly rendered it irrelevant. Crucial emotional moments that could have been incredibly poignant fell short where a couple more sentences could have really drove it home and, at the very least, partially redeemed the story. The most emotion we got in this story came in the form of Katniss' uncharacteristic wallowing, which was exhausting at best.<br /><br />- The Ending<br /><br />The ending was so incredibly unsatisfying. The choice - the \\"love triangle\\" - while perhaps not the driving plot element in the story, was still such an integral and important emotional aspect of the series to some of the readers. The relationship Katniss had with both Peeta and Gale, and the discoveries about herself that could have accompanied each one in this story, deserved more attention. At this point in the story, it was truly the ONLY thing left that could offer both the readers and characters a semblance of hope, a way to crawl out of that despairing pit the author threw us all into. That while unicorns and rainbows were not necessary, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were able to regain something to live for out of the ashes.<br /><br />But like everything else, it fell ridiculously short and was resolved in three paragraphs that did little to convince me the love Katniss and Peeta had was discovered and regained, respectively, in a deep and meaningful way, besides the two of them being each other's last remaining option. Or, in Katniss' case, that Peeta or their children were able to bring her a joy that made everything she went through bearable, at the very least. That was perhaps the most heartbreaking part of it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...<br /><br />This book does not contain any of the qualities I found most prominent in the first two books. When I finished it, I even went back to the first two and tried re-reading parts that resonated with me the first time around, in some feeble attempt to remind myself why I was so moved by it in the first place. Unfortunately, there was a dark shadow cast over those moments - obscuring the characters I adored - because I can't unsee what I've already seen. This book cheapened the entire series, all the intimate, human moments it contained, because I now know where their roads lead.<br /><br />To a conclusion, an ending, both the characters and the readers did not deserve.

B008GGA5EQ|5.0|A Scheherazade of erotic literature, Thurlow weaves a tale as if her life depends upon it. I won't provide a summary because an overview is given in the product description and other reviews.<br />`Girl Trade' is evidence that a contemporary author of erotica can produce literary, scholarly, sensitive, intensely passionate work, deserving a place among notable authors of the genre, long dead.<br /><br />Cambridge educated Thurlow takes her reader into a world of literature designed to wring every drop of emotion from you. This is the first story in this genre that has genuinely moved me. As I've come to expect from Thurlow, the descriptive element is sumptuous, as are the intended omissions that are in themselves incredibly powerful. For example, we never discover our girl's real name, in common with many commodities bought and sold, our protagonist answers to numerous given names.<br /><br />The story is populated with antagonists some of whom are strangely sympathetic, and others who made me want to look away. I confess to reading some parts of this novel through eye-slits as if watching a scary film from behind my hands. Talking of movies, what a terrific film this book would make, although you hardly need cinematography to bring the images to life, Thurlow provides imagery in abundance. I shall always want to cross Thurlow's shifting Rubicon.<br /><br />If you are a writer in this genre I also recommend [[ASIN:B00A0R8YYW The Fifty Shades of Grey Phenomena - How to write best-selling erotic romance]]
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Paolo is a great writer.  The prose is surreal and atmospheric.  The character development draws the reader in.  I haven't read this author before but I will look for his new novels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use.  How do you change home location? I like the simplicity of this app. Easy to load on my Kindle Fire.
B002ISID10|3.0|This album is ok and its mainly because Joey Sturgis is the man and made them sound decent. Don't waste your time with this one just go pick up Reckless and Relentless and you'll be set because that is Joey at his finest and AA at their finest too.

B000FC2KL0|4.0|I went into this book a big chilli peppers fan since the mid80`s. I knew about some of his using. But I had no idea how bad it really was. He should have been dead long ago. This gives new depth and meaning to all of their great music. It has also given perspective to my own struggle with dependencies in my life.  I devoured this book in two days like a new sack of drugs.

B004SEVPWQ|4.0|I take away one star because at times just playing it without music is kinda boring. It looks good on my phone and tablet though.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Don't have an android but works fine on my Kindle.  My husband and I are always addicted to the weather.

B005LAIIA8|1.0|Disney should be ashamed to have their name on this junk! Walt must be very disappointed in what has become of his company. This was nothing at all like the previews made it out to be. Disgusting is the only thing that can be said of this filth. I would rate this no stars but the website won't let me!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|I liked the love but the sex part to me didn't need to be so graphic and went on and on with the same details.<br />Con would be to me liked by younger clients I'm in my 60's.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is refreshing from the viewpoint of a neurosurgeon, who according to the book, didn't have a strong religious preference prior to his NDE.  Though out our human existence there are tens of thousands of incidents that cannot be explained scientifically or even religiously.  Here is a man that had a life threatening illness where part of his brain was deemed dead and he had a remarkable recovery that surprised even his physicians.  There will be critics who will always believe he had nothing more than a six day period of delusions which became his reality.  Because of his book I am now reading Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagels....
B0086700CM|5.0|I chooses this rating because by the way it looks I would like to play it. I like this product because it is very fun to play.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Some games don't play well on tablets or smart phones but this one does.  Fast and fun and slightly addicting

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out!! Temple run 2 is a lot better than Temple run.....I love it!!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Reading Tuesdays with Morrie was a class assingment. It was assigned a month after the Passing of my Mother. I felt supported in the way I cared for my mother because we talked about dying and accepted it as much as you possibly can. I believe this book would help families deal with death in a helpful way. Thank you for asking.
B005DZMP00|4.0|I don't know how the Dead obtained such good sound, so relatively early (here 1972), in the variety of circumstances that their live concerts provided.  The stuff here is from a variety of venues -- it isn't a single concert -- but it's none the worse for that.  It's also distinguished by the presence of the Godchauxes as well as Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan, their keyboardist, harmonica man, and solid blues voice, who died in March 1973 and whose place Keith Godchaux took as far as keyboards were concerned.  The material on disc one is standard Dead fare for the concerts of that era -- \\"Bertha,\\" \\"Sugaree\\" (Jerry G. more audible than usual), \\"Deal,\\" Black-Throated Wind,\\" and, at the end of the disc, two fine, more extended jams on \\"Good Lovin'\\"(which Weir never did badly) and \\"Playin' in the Band.\\"  The second disc is odder and might be off-putting for first-timers: a near-20 minute jam on \\"Dark Star\\" without much vocal contribution, followed after nearly 3 minutes of drums by a 30-minute jam on \\"The Other One.\\"  The style of the jamming is pretty mellow, in the \\"music-from-the heart-of-space\\" mode for much of the time, lovely in its way, but maybe an acquired taste.  Personally, I love it on long car trips, but be warned.  Disc 2 closes with 10+ minutes of a nice Merle Haggard song, \\"Sing me back home\\" (which The Dead didn't play much in the later '70s and '80s), and then three strong tracks from a concert at Wembley featuring \\"Not Fade Away\\" and \\"Goin' down the Road feelin' Bad.\\"  Good stuff, then, and lovely sound -- but just be aware of the spacey 50 minutes!
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Worst movie ever. No plot what so ever. Don't waste your time or money on this film. Time you will never get back.
0195145925|1.0|Shame to Julian Barbour for publishing a book that has &#34;physics&#34; in the title, but not one single equation! Where are the new ideas? Not in this book, for sure. Save your money!
B000JIHP88|3.0|Bought this mobile baby loves it but the leaves on the mobile stopped working after 1month. It only works when you take off the leaves then the animals turn!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love to read Grisham books on vacation because they are easy to read.  This book had a few interesting twists and turns, and great locations which would be perfect for a movie.  So sit back with a banana moma in your hand, and relax on the lounge chair in front of a beautiful caribbean sea and enjoy!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|It is a cool app, and fun to play with, mostly for the grandkids but interesting if you like the stars and want to identify them.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Always innovative, Rush takes the concept album to new heights, a challenge to ANY other band. Why this was not a Grammy winner, well, we'll never understand. The entire collection is incredible, as is any track taken individually. Anyone sick of 30-40 year old bands who ride the coattails of their old favorites, rejoice! That is not Rush, and never has been, and probably never will be. When they can no longer innovate, I'm sure they will find something even more fascinating to do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Equal to the first two seasons.  I was stunned by the ending and quite sad but hope for a recovery in Season 4. Have been quite invested in this series!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a fun entertaining game. has no glitches that I can see. holds the atenchsen of the player very well.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm still reading it, and i'm loving it!  Similar to the Shades of Grey Trilogy.  Not sure which on was written first, but loving it!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I am not very into foreign films but this one is filmed beautifully with tones of red and green and artistic interpretations of love and relationships between everyday people. One of my favorites by far.

0425252868|5.0|I heard about this book while listening to Fox News on Sirius/XM radio and was piqued by the content. Having read the book I have to admit that it was one of the best WWII books that I have read in awfully long time. The author easily weaves between the lives and experiences of both pilots before setting the stage for the critical flight. It's nice to see that normalcy existed in the lives of the fighters on both sides of the conflict, and this is what has set this book apart from many others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I believe that you should get coin dozer because it is a very cool game and all of my friends have it. I like the game mostly because it is very popular.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Initial few moments of trailer invariably are not smooth -- they hesitate and sound is not quite right. Need to restart to get smoothness...
B007UQRW62|4.0|Fantastic trip in the past, when the musical was GREAT!!!  The box with the umbrella is really fine, now i can &#34;singing' in the rain&#34;.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this! I tried this game several months earlier and apparently there was a glitch so I deleted it but this time everything worked fine and I played all the way through it.  It was interesting and not so hard that I couldn't eventually find all the objects or figure out the puzzles. It wasn't too easy either so that I didn't just rush through the game. I was kind of sad when I finished the game, I wanted it to continue longer! It's a good game.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Our family has been going around singing the different songs from Les Misarbles.  We have all enjoyed it so very much. If you loved the movie, buy the soundtrack; you will relive this wonderful story of redemption through its songs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was not able to put this book down.  Many tears and smiles throughout.  A great love story.  I would love to meet Ana and Christian.
B006WWTKQ0|4.0|We loved the songs.  The graphics, colors and 3D are amazing.  The plot is just okay.  They could have done more to develop it.  Overall, it is an entertaining movie for the whole family.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great job Dave!  Really captures the feeling and the music and the magic behind the music of the 70's and 80's... And, transcends to today!  The songmaking in the new studio was fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|at first the app was great.but after I didn't play the game for a week all my gems (money in the game)were gone.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A depressing book, but only because of Pats inability to accept and trust, the loyalty he has around him. I read it in one afternoon it was so well written, now I need to see how the movie stacks up
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book because I enjoyed \\"The Help\\" which is similar genre. I found \\"The Kitchen House\\" to be just as intertaining, and enjoyable as the first book. Usually, the second book by an auther is not as intriguing as the first~ not the case here!
0425252868|5.0|This is an entirely different look at WWII.  It gives you a balance you would never otherwise get.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The season was great. The only negative about it, which was a very negative, was it looked like Michael was killed in an automobile accident in the very last scene. This was very tragic and really unnecessary for the writers to create this. If he in fact dies, this makes the show lopsided with tragedy, which could lead to lost viewers. This would include me.
B0053FANS6|5.0|great movies in one compact case makes more room for more movies on my shelve that makes it easier to get more movies.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|This is a beautiful movie with great characters, great acting and a great cast. I have seen this before in the theater, and was more then impressed to get it for friends who came over to see.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is the best movies I've seen in years! Quite literally, it fed my soul with all these wondrous adventures, wonderful characters, great art and graphics, few but amazing alien races. This movie is literally one of the most incredible movies I've seen in my entire life. I love John Carter! If I could I'd give it a million stars! It's a masterpiece. It has it all and the plot has no flaws. I just love it, adore it! I am looking forward for the next chapters and my next purchase could be the set of John Carter's books!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|first, quality of the download is good, not HD mind you, but good. The show itself, I love the characters, laugh out loud funny, and not really written for the 'realty show' crowd. Intelligent comedy = 5 stars
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I started watching the show between seasons 1 and 2 and have been addicted since.  I have never enjoyed comics before but have found these to be equally as addictive as the show.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|ok, how do you not rate this five stars. plays great, sounds great, and yup, it's Bob Marley. MP3 download and in the Amazon player, use it wherever you go with a connection. Simple and great
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Fantastic service, I received it very quickly and exactly what I was looking for and it was cheaper than anywhere else that I looked
B0078N2T8I|5.0|What is real?  What gives us nightmares?  Michael Shannon as Curtis LaForche gives a remarkable performance as a man who is grappling with reality.  His mother, played by Kathy Baker, deserted her young family only to be found a week later rummaging through dumpsters for a meal.  Committed to insane asylum as a paranoid schizophrenic Curtis and his devoted wife Samantha, Jessica Chastain, are terrified he is going down the same road.  The filament that divides mental health vs mental breakdown becomes increasingly fragile.  Or could Curtis be sane?  Surely not, he is wetting the bed, acting increasingly erratic at home and work while making scenes in public.  Shannon had me on the edge of my seat and Chastain made a very convincing loving but exasperated wife.  The twists and turns made me gasp and the ending was the biggest surprise of all.<br /><br />Great script and direction from Jeff Nichols.  I will be a new follower of his work. Shannon you will recognize if you are a fan of Boardwalk Empire.  Chastain will be on the Red Carpet tomorrow night for a second year in a row.  Oscar's oversight but don't let it be yours.<br /><br />Put the popcorn in a bowl, find a comfortable place on sofa and enjoy a terrific movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books are an easy read and most enjoyable :) I would recommend indefinitely! Thank u Christian and Ana for warming many a cold night ;)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very good YA novel.  Knew it was part of a trilogy but still felt like I wanted more which is what the author wanted I suppose because now I want to really want to read the next book in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is great!  It held my interest throughout the entire book, and you never know where it is going next.
0865479410|5.0|I read self help books sparingly. This one is a little different in its approach. In short, don't try TOO HARD. Point out some of the obvious and not so obvious flaws of average advice.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great books! Almost finished the last one. The author writes well. Although it's considered 'young adult', every adult I know who has read it has enjoyed it.
1741798981|5.0|This is a thorough guide.  I only wish the included map covered more territory; it's much too skimpy and made of regular stock paper - not too sturdy.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|I loved this book. The whole series is amazing, page turning, gripping, entertaining, sexy. I will probably read the series again.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I really wish there were more films like this.  Great entertainment over the other sex driven, low grey matter usage films I now see today.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a great app. It was just what I needed. It's easy to use and has all the functions I could want.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Some incredibly dark moments, but the characters are well developed and engaging.  The storyline is fast-moving, keeping the reader turning those pages to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Can't wait to start the 2nd book in the trilogy!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I thought it would had more of a story line. It was hard to follow along. I usually tend to finish a book within the week but this took me longer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it in 3 days and it reminded me what a master Stephen King is.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Robert Preston always seemed like strange casting for this movie (I keep waiting for him to break into song) but somehow I always found him endearing. I bought this to watch with my grandson and he loves it, which is what it is all about
B0098WVT9W|5.0|I especially love the digital booklet.  Ever since we started downloading music, I have missed reading liner notes and learning who wrote (and played) on the songs.
B004G600A4|5.0|Our granddaughters love this video, and I enjoy watching it with them.  They have a copy at home and at our house.  Another &#34;princess&#34; winner for Disney!
0061726834|5.0|(Source: I won a copy of this book! Thanks to Heather from ‘The Misadventures of a twenty something year old girl’)<br />This is the first book in the Delirium trilogy.<br />Lena has only 95 days to wait. 95 days, until she turns 18, and 95 days ‘til she gets ‘the cure’.<br />Lena lives in a society where love is a disease, and everyone gets their brain chopped up at age 18, to cure them of love. Everyone is then paired and allowed to have children – all without love. This is designed to keep people happy and safe, and free of the risks and pain of love.<br /><br />Lena cannot wait for ‘the cure’. Her mother was resistant to the cure, and had the procedure 4 times before finally committing suicide.  Lena hates that the disease made her mother leave her, and she hates that everyone who knows the story looks down on her because her mother was infected.<br /><br />When Lena meets Alex, a boy who works as a guard, she knows that she shouldn’t be talking to him – girls and boys are not allowed to mix, but something makes her want to see him again, and again after that. Lena is shocked by her best friend Hana’s sudden risqué behaviour, but then begins to do risky things herself so that she can spend time with Alex.<br /><br />Soon Lena begins to admit to herself that her behaviour is wrong, but at the same time knows that she belongs with Alex. But with the days counting down until her own procedure, will Lena give up everything for love, and run away with Alex?<br /><br />I liked this book, it was slow in places, but explosive in others, and a lot of the writing was simply beautiful.<br /><br />I had my doubts when I began reading this book. Firstly, Lena says that it has been ‘64 years since the president and the consortium identified love as a disease’. In my opinion something like that would surely have been decided by people in a medical or health profession, such as the World Health Organisation, not the president! But this is probably just me being picky!<br /><br />Lena was an interesting character. She was so dead set on ‘the cure’ that she was counting down the days! Who the hell counts down the days to getting their brain chopped up?  She was a bit of a stick-in-the-mud, and wouldn’t do anything without permission in triplicate. If her friend even so much as said a word out of line, Lena was horrified, telling her off, and checking that one of the enforcers wasn’t coming to arrest her.<br /><br />When Lena first met Alex, she was again scared and worried that she would be arrested. Even once she started to get to know him, she still behaved this way. In fact it took a long time for Lena to loosen up. When Alex eventually admitted that he was in fact ‘uncured’ Lena almost had a fit!<br /><br />I liked Alex, although it was funny to see the way he tried to bring Lena out of her shell. I immediately knew that he was uncured though, simply by the way he spoke and acted, his announcement was no surprise for me. I did feel a little sorry for him at first, picking Lena to love was not an easy decision, as Lena was so dead-set on being cured. He also risked a lot when he told her his secret, as she could so easily have exposed him for what he was.<br /><br />I liked the storyline in this book. I think the idea of treating love like a disease is an interesting one; I just don’t think that people would really be interested in being love-free in the real world though, as love is something that people strive for. I understand how some people might be interested, maybe someone going through a messy divorce, or someone grieving would consider it, but I just don’t think that anyone would ever want to give up their love for their children no matter what.<br /><br />I thought that the way partners were picked was a little weird. I know arranged marriages do work, but only because love grows between the couple. How people are supposed to live in such sterile relationships, and have children is a little beyond me. Children are obviously conceived in the same way as normal, but surely being forced to have sex with a random person picked for you by a computer, who you have absolutely zero feelings for would not be enjoyable? It’s almost like being raped by the government.<br /><br />The idea of children being brought up in such a sterile world worried me too. I liked that Lena had good memories of her mom, which seemed in part due to her being uncured, and I really don’t get how anyone can raise children without love, and more to the point, how awful to not have parents that love you!<br /><br />I did find it a little strange that Lena was so set on the cure considering how much she loved the things that her mom did when she was uncured, but I suppose you can see both arguments for why she wanted to not be different, and to be ‘safe’. I just found it a little hypocritical that the things that Lena remembered and loved about her mom were the things that made her different, while Lena was so against being different herself.<br /><br />The main problem with this book was the slow parts though. While some parts were really good, and there were some beautiful lines every so often, parts of it were just tedious. I got to the point where when I hit a slow part I started reading faster to try to get through it, which helped things a bit. The book could have done with being paced a little more quickly in my opinion though.<br /><br />There were some other elements of the story which I wasn’t able to guess, and there were several moments when I thought ‘OMG’, and was desperate to find out what would happen. The revelations that Lena comes upon towards the end of the book were pretty good, although there was a lot that was left open-ended to be explored in the next two books I presume.<br /><br />I have to say that the end of the book was very exciting, and I really liked it. Things happened that I didn’t expect, and the very end was quite heart-breaking.The cliff-hanger ending was unfortunate, but I do want to read the next book and find out what happens.<br />Overall; an interesting YA dystopian, a really good read if you can look past the slower parts.<br />8.5 out of 10.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so addicting more and more each season. It just continues to get better. It is beautifully made and very well acted!
B006P0FIGU|1.0|Why, Mads, why?  Tell your agent &#34;no more popcorn!&#34;  At least viewers can see you can fence.  And crack a joke.  But the film is so boring.  Even Christopher Waltz is subdued under the weight of scenery and camera movements and 3D.
0767821629|3.0|Interesting movie, but wouldn't play all the way to the end. If I could have seen the whole thing, I might have given it a higher rating.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|You've seen the jokes about swords and short skirts on youtube.  You will probably enjoy the film if you're a male between ten and twenty-five.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy is a skilled author but can also get to be a little boring.  When adding too much detail I find myself scanning the pages until I am back to the interesting and exciting events that take place. I have been a fan of Tom Clancy for many years and will continue to enjoy his writing.

B002M9WW30|2.0|Please keep in mind I am not criticizing the Rocky movies, I am criticizing the dvds themselves. Originally, when I first bought the dvds, discs 4-6 were unplayable. I returned them, but was unable to get an exchange because Amazon was out of stock. In order to repurchase I would have to pay $20 more than I originally do. Reasonably pissed off, I contacted Amazon through a chat. I must say they handled the situation gracefully. I was told that the conversation would be saved and when the dvds became available again through Amazon, I could repurchase them at the price I originally purchased them at, I would just need to purchase through an online chat. As far as I know, the dvds are now fixed. I received my boxed set, checked all of them and they work great. My only criticism is that how would other customers, who had the same problem as me, know that the situation could be easily resolved through an online chat. Also, if you know that customers are having issues with broken dvds, stop selling them! This is why I am giving this only 2 stars. This whole situation could have been avoided if they stopped knowingly selling a defective product.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Get all three books.  They are very entertaining.  Powerful enough to take you from your present world!  Would recommend<br />and have.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A pleasantly unique storyline that didn't feel like a re-hashing of the same sci-fi movie cliches.<br /><br />Some people seem to be put-off by the JGL makeup for a more 'Bruce Willis-ly' look but I personally found it to be subtle enough to not seem cartoony but accurate enough to genuinely feel like you're looking at a young Willis.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|Worth the rental price but I can't say this is a better film than Darjeeling Limited (which I personally enjoy the most of Wes Anderson's films), Life Aquatic or Fantastic Mr. Fox.<br /><br />If you like Wes Anderson then you should enjoy this film.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A very funny and clever movie that isn't entirely predictable. It also has a great soundtrack. Rebel Wilson makes this movie.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|Fantastic cast of characters.  Great story line.  Justice triumphs! Some characters are in the Devils Alternative so it's like reading about a good friend's trials and tribulations.

B003O86FMW|5.0|2nd book suspenseful with a twist, brought new characters in and weaving the old ones into the story.  Looking forward to the last book 3. Enjoy Collins writing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very cool detective game! Even the tricky parts could be accomplished with a bit of ingenuity! I want the second part now...
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|Really entertaining and suspenseful! Kevin Bacon is awesome and the women in the show are gorgeous!!!! Hope this show lasts a few seasons!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|An amazing adventure like none you will ever take.  The Night Circus had the most unique and beautiful imagery for a novel I have ever read.  Very interesting cast of characters who are both human and otherworldly.  My only criticism is that the story ended too abruptly.  I felt more needed to be revealed at the ending.  Nonetheless, a fantastic novel.
B00B19F3PG|3.0|Not as good as I hoped but not nearly as bad. The spaniard makes the film for sure, very good actor.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was fascinated by the title and loved how Diffenbaugh used the love of flowers to be the connecting thread between the characters.  A reminder that it is when we are the most unloveable that we most need love!  Everyone who decides to become a foster parent or who decides to adopt needs to read this book.  These children often come out of unimaginably cruel situations and need patience and understanding.  Most of all, they need to be and feel wanted and loved.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Probably one of the best scary films I have seen in a long time! Finally some one makes a scary film worth watching!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Talk about not knowing where a story line will go!  Terrific read...but very harsh in places.  An important reminder to all of us who never know when we may be dealing with a sociopath or a psychopath.  They do indeed walk among us.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Nothing like the original series. Lame comes to mind. Some good ideas for special effects poorly employed. Should have been a made for tv movie.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I read the book and was hoping to be &#34;enlightened&#34; when the movie came out.  No dice.  The movie was just as confusingI  Did he die in the end?  My husband said they didn't have to spend too much to make this movie considering that most of it took place in a limousine!  Rob put so much in to this character and yet he was able to pull this off.  He did such a great job.  Its just too bad the Academy didn't feel he was Oscar worthy because he truly was!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good storyline. Dialog was a bit garbled and some confusion at times but overall worth watching. It  fills an evening
B000ZN8036|5.0|I choose this rating because it was excellent.<br />I wasn't expecting him to die in the end.<br />One of the reasons I bought it was because Kristen Stewart was in it.  She portrayed a girl named Tracy.  In fact the star Emile Hirsch recommended her to Katherine Hardwicke who was getting reading to do Twilight.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Okay, I admit, I was very late coming to the Downton Abbey party.  I'm not sure why since I generally enjoy this sort of thing.  However, I was and I'm making up for it now.  I love the character development, though I don't like all of the characters.  The story development is well done too, and I really, really like that it's filmed on location at Highclere.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The first, second and last of the Sword of Truth series are without a doubt the best books I have ever read and I read a lot of books.

B003N0XDT4|4.0|My Fiio is a great addition to any high quality headphone. The box it comes in is extremely suspiciously similar to an Iphone 4s case, but that doesn't matter. What does matter is the quality control, it was shipped to me with a malfunctioning USB. It had a short in it and would only work when held in a certain position and after a few days it just completely stopped. Luckily I had another one laying around, but not one specially made for music unfortunately. however the product itself works fine and I recommend it, but I do think its rating of 300 ohms is too high, my DT990 pros have 250 ohms and I can listen to them with the E7 turned all the way up and still not seem \\"very loud\\", but it is enough for me.
0451232852|5.0|This is the kind of book that you know you should go to sleep but you keep telling yourself one more chapter. Ken Follett is so detailed you fall in love with the characters! Love this author!

B00138H0H4|5.0|I absolutely love Brandi Carlile's voice and am amazed at how she can go from bluesy and folksy to rocker on the same album (and in some case the same song)! This album really showcases her talents, and I love every song.

B0073U2F12|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game, though I have yet to play its predecessor. Although it's a great game, it can definitely be improved upon. It takes forever to load after starting it up, and lags throughout the game. Also, the game play isn't very sensitive. Several times, I have died because the game didn't recognize my touch. Other than those things, it's a great game.
B009GX6600|5.0|I started watching NCIS only recently, so I missed several episodes of the current season. I purchased the watch instantly episodes to get caught up. Love this option!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Open, honest, disturbing, real, visual, true and straight from her heart...so difficult to believe she went through this. She is a hero and survivor.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Needs better controls to select/scroll pieces. Otherwise great puzzle game. Lots of puzzles to choose from. Just when trying to scroll i5 drags oieces ou5 or when 5rying 5o drag pieces i5 scrolls instead.
0525953728|3.0|It is obvious why people give high ratings to this book. People consider the SEALS as American heroes, as it should be. The killing of Osama Bin Laden is one of the most remarkable moments of recent USA history. Even if it did not change much the course of the battle,  it felt like winning a war. Perhaps because everyone knew that America was fighting wars that cannot be won, everyone related the killing of OBL to the moment of victory that we all wanted to savor. This is why people give 4-5 starts to this book.<br /><br />If you just review the narrative and the story as it is told, this is just an average book. Indeed, this book without the narrative of the OBL operation would be unbearable (1-2 stars). Not only the story is repetitive and unsubstantial, but also lacks any sense of humanity. If seems that the author thinks and feels like he was part of a video game, just a character trained to kill, where SEALS are machines trained to shoot and to not to feel or think. Reading the books it seems that the SEALS lack any sense of understanding of the geopolitical reasons that cause the problems they are sent to fight for.<br /><br />Not a single time in this book you will find intelligent thinking, opinion or historical context to frame the military operations. It is all about macho training and macho shooting. The only part when the author deviates from the military narrative is to complain and ridiculize President Obama and Vicepresident Biden. He talks with much respect about all his commanders and military leaders (as he should do) and with so much disrespect for the President. In a childish move he even makes jokes and expresses his disdain when the team was asked to sign a American Flag that was meant to be framed and kept as a memory of the event. You should not be surprised if you don't read much intelligence in this book, after all what could be expected from a man that was trained to kill and not to think.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I was a little disappointed but it wasnt that bad.  I was hoping it would be more intense and not so predictable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in &#34;the other side&#34; of life and even for those who don't. Very interesting, comforting and inspiring book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Having seen the Twilight Saga movies I wasn't sure how I would like hearing a different voice for Bella. After a few pages it made no difference. The narrator did an excellent job with this book. I would love to listen to more books narrated by her. As far as the story itself, I feel that this is a perfect 10. It kept me reading for hours. I would recommend it to all ages. I was so sorry to get to the end.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is so fun to rank up and run ur own park. so fun i reccomend it for evryone to play

B0089LX8II|4.0|ex·pa·tri·ate: Residing in a different country while maintaining citizenship of your native homeland.<br /><br />An enjoyable high octane action flick utilizing a cookie-cutter screenplay. Yes, it is a formula product, but surprisingly even productions that rip from the blueprint often screw up. Having been able to, at the very least, overcome the astounding amount of inane and worthless flicks that populate the cinematic landscape nowadays is in itself a success. This tracked true to the recipe, so I would categorize it as very solid.<br /><br />Preface caveat: Aaron Eckart is one of those performers that I seemingly cannot connect with on any level. He has all the hallmarks of a quality actor - projection, presence, and personality. Yet for all those talents - I can't seem to find common ground. And I honestly can't explain why.<br /><br />That said, I found his performance in this production surprisingly engaging and quite entertaining. Hopefully it's a trend.<br /><br />In 'Expatriate' he plays Ben Logan, tech security specialist. Hired by a global security company for his expertise - breaking into previously thought of unhackable systems - exposing vulnerabilities, weaknesses and flaws in their product lines.<br /><br />To showcase his level of commitment to the company, Ben chooses to stay overseas in order to work at the Belgian offices of the corporation. Along with him is his young daughter Amy, although she isn't nearly as pleased with her new status as an expatriate. But the death of her mother back in the states left no other choice. Having had little contact with her father since birth, the incongruent pair are just now learning to adjust to one another; her dad's comfortable paycheck acting as a stable platform for their fresh start, making the transition bearable.<br /><br />Until the day that his company literally disappears.<br /><br />Everyone he knew is gone. The office he has been going to daily for the past six months is stripped bare, his fellow employees vanished. Everything a modern person uses to define a life no longer exists for Logan - no bank account, no money, no digital records, no identification, nothing. Not even his cell phone, which is company property, works anymore. His existence has been erased.<br /><br />Just what's going on?<br /><br />As father and daughter are caught up in a bizarre and terrifying world of espionage and twisted corporate shadows, they're forced on the run. With little or no break, they have to stay one step in front of professional assassins and various spy agencies looking to put them into a set of anonymous graves.<br /><br />There were some weaknesses in the film that have to be acknowledged.<br /><br />Young co-star Liana Liberato's character as Amy was often artificially too self-aware. For someone who projected typical adolescent immaturity at the beginning of the film, to then flip a switch and become a strong and emotionally composed character - i.e. The driving sequence/interrogation - was ridiculous. And certain aspects of the script rang false; particularly when the intelligence officers gather to discuss the true situation of Ben Logan.<br /><br />Still, those minor criticisms were mostly forgivable when balanced out with the enjoyable heart-thumping pace of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, you'll enjoy this if you can imagine Jason Bourne with a kid.llow employees vanished.

B007REV4YI|5.0|***Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />Extremely enjoyable. Hardened, in more ways than one, comes Daniel Craig. A true advancement, using 'Quantum' and 'Casino' as stepping blocks for this 007 of the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Broccoli's EON again finding the right blend of old school and new school - producing a sharper, tougher, and in an unexpected twist, a more human James Bond. Arguably the deepest and most complex film of the entire franchise; exposing the raw pain that became the soil which bred Britain's greatest field agent.<br /><br />Absolutely love that the writers continued the concept of orphans making the best operators. For some reason I've always found that idea completely reasonable, despite evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Opens as Bond chases down an elite enemy agent - one virtually his equal in every respect. This operative must be stopped at all costs because he's ferrying a stolen NOC List - every covert operative in the world, their alias legends, and true identities. If it reaches the open market, the data will devastate British intelligence and cripple the west's ability to function on the world stage.<br /><br />As the adrenaline pounding chase explodes out of Istanbul, M orders Bond's second to take a dynamic sniper shot while 007 and the opposition operator battle atop a racing train. It is SIS' last chance at recovering the list. The back-up hesitates, the shot unclear. The chief demands it be taken. Missing the target, Bond is hit instead; his body disappears falling into a massive gorge.<br /><br />James Bond, Agent 007 is dead.<br /><br />A posthumous star is carved into the wall of anonymous heroes. Life and the world moves on.<br /><br />Six months pass.<br /><br />Despite being one of the most secure buildings on the planet, a massive explosion is set off within the heart of British Intelligence. MI6's Vauxhall headquarters is destroyed, killing many of the senior staff. Whoever this person is or whomever they represent - they know every code, every process, and every access. This isn't a stranger.<br /><br />Cut to Bond. He's alive and has unofficially retired from - everything. The shot that should have killed him has instead left him breathing, but deeply bitter and scarred. Knowing who gave the shoot order, betrayal isn't something that sits well with our man. Still,  deep within his core, beats the heart of a patriot. After learning of the assault to the service, he chooses a return to the fold. As it becomes clear the attack was against M herself, he realizes that she already has the answer to the identity of their unseen assailant, but rebuffs all attempts at exposing their tormentor. M refuses to believe that, evidence to the contrary in the form of a risen 007, the dead can indeed return.<br /><br />Marking her final time as Chief of British SIS, the sublime Dame Judi Dench. She'll be missed. Her departure an understandable move by the producers. I get it, they're refreshing the brand. But in my opinion she was the best 'M' of the entire franchise and won't be easily replaced. Even though I think Ralph Fiennes is a superb choice, it will be a difficult transition from this cinephile's perspective.<br /><br />And speaking of co-stars, thought it was hilarious how the creative team got the sexual tension between the new Moneypenny and JB out of the way. To quote Simon Pegg in [[ASIN:B0019MFY3Q Spaced]], \\"It had to be done.\\" And I adored Naomi Harris' spunky kickass self. No longer a tame unrequited paper-pusher, Moneypenny is nearly equal to Bond himself - fantastic. And kudos for EON selecting a truly beautiful female. There are too many Thandie Newtons and Salma Hayaks - propped-up outliers and stretched has-beens whose sexuality is based on superficial shock and populist momentum rather than true sensuality. Nice!<br /><br />As Bond and M confront a specter from the past, no pun intended, sins and unforgiven transgressions are revealed. A twisted cauldron of anger, love, resentment and passion is brewed - spilling its terrible contents onto the Scottish lowlands.<br /><br />A sublimely rich and incredibly enjoyable film that I've already purchased for repeat viewings.ntment and passion is brewed - spilling its terrible contents onto the Scottish lowlands.<br /><br />A sublimely rich and incredibly enjoyable film that I've already purchased for repeat viewings.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Both book one and book two have such well developed characters that I feel a part of their lives and I miss them when I have finished the book.  Their lives are set against the backdrop of historical events that changed the world, events I have read about in history books but now have a much better feel of what it was like to live through those times.  A transporting read and I cannot wait to read book three.  Thank you, Ken Follett.
1594744769|1.0|I was sorely disappointed by this book, and I must say, it reinforced the saying \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\".<br /><br />When I first came across it and put it on my reading list months ago, I was under the impression that it was going to be a mystery/suspense story, and when I finally picked it up, I was excited to read it.<br /><br />It was nothing like what I expected, and I will go as far as to say that based on my expectations, this book fell flat and there was nothing that could save it.<br /><br />The main thing that bothered me was that it was more of a science fiction-fantasy book, which is a genre I absolutely LOATHE! So I felt I was inadvertently suckered into reading the sort of stuff I typically stay far, far away from. I was not drawn in, and agree with the poster who also said it was a book to be endured. I only kept reading because it was the only book I had to keep me occupied during a long day on a job, but I was ready to put it down before I was even halfway.<br /><br />I am glad to be done with it.

0984999302|5.0|I recently enrolled in a top ranked entrepreneurship class. Now, I am thanking God that as a part of that class I am &#34;forced&#34; to read this book!<br />I have dyslexia and DO NOT like to read! But I do know how to sell a product I believe in, AND in turn make other people A LOT MORE MONEY than I make.<br />Because others see this, I have been told numerous times to start my own business. But that is a major risk. And I don't know how to set up things, like policies and procedures. Nor do I want to.<br />This book is not that! It is more like a cookbook, or &#34;how to book&#34; on effectively building your own business. How well you thoroughly implement the maneuvering directions, the more you can see it is within your own hands to manage how much success in business that you want.<br />After having this book, I now have tools to use and can see the potential of growing my own business.

Many will see it as a great science fiction novel, or perhaps a historical novel, with a love story involved. I see it as a great love story revolving around a travel backward in time, with a great deal of historical accuracy. It's the love story that will truly stick with you.  It's the love story that will make you sorry the book wasn't longer, even at 850 pages.<br /><br />The novel is a love story between a man from the present and a woman he meets when he travels back to 1958. It's also a love story about a period in time much simpler and slower paced than today, a time when Stephen King was growing up, and King describes it in vivid, nostalgic detail.  And finally, it's a love story about life in a small town, where everybody cares about one another, where you never feel alone, where everybody is drawn to one other by the simplest things in life (high school football, the school dance, charity events, holiday celebrations).<br /><br />Stephen King knows how to tell a story.  But here, he raises the bar even for himself.  This novel is every bit as good a traditional love story as many of the classic romances. That it takes place in the past, with time travel as its vehicle and actual historic events as the backdrop, is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />The master story teller has done it again, but with something very different from most of his writing. Even romance novel enthusiasts will love this novel. It is simply one of the best stories I have read in a long time. Don't miss it.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|How can people survive in the Russia described here? It is terrifying. The entire trilogy is riveting. Leo is one of those characters that is both good and bad.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|This case is everything I expected it to be.  The durability is a big plus.  I liked it so much that I purchased one for my granddaughter.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|At first blush it starts like a programmed robot is going to be pushing standard navy dogma. Quickly though Chris breaks out and has a real human voice with a real story to tell.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|I had a copy on my old computer that was watched frequently. I lost that hard drive and all its contents. This is a great classic well worth having
B007M45PMU|4.0|the music is catchy and the lyrics are good.<br />just when you think you know what they are going to say they toss in a nice hook.
B007SPPANM|3.0|Video quality was what I expected. I had all but worn out my previous copy on VHS. A resonable price for what was received.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Having lived abroad for 17 years, I often ask my husband when America will no longer feel strange.  Now that we are parents to 2 toddlers, we are slowly accepting that it will always feel strange as long as we have to interact with other parents.  This book highlights all of the standard American parenting neuroses that I find ridiculous, while reminding me that I'm not a bad mother when I sit in a bookstore and refuse to hover over my daughter while she attempts to interact with other kids.
B005LAII12|2.0|This video although funny, went a bit over the top. It lacked story line and tried to make up for it in shock value.
0061714402|5.0|The stories reminded me of my youth; where I was when each album was released, what events in my life were occurring when I was fixated on a specific Megadeth album or song.  I was cool to see what Dave was doing at the same time I was serving in the military, attending college, getting married, etc.  You really don't know what these people's lives are like or what events occur that influence a great song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this subway surfer game a lot it is just like temple run and I love these kinds of games so much

B0057R5XRG|5.0|Definitely worth it, was extremely cheap and I believe I was even offered some other discount along with it.....recommend it.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was awesome. I wanted to read the book before I went to see the movie. The book out shined the movie ten times over. I love all of Nicholas Sparks books but this one has been the best so far.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Saw the movie and loved the music...This cd was a treat! I think most die-hard country fans would be surprised at this collection of sweet music.

1907590331|4.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a morose tale of the unfulfilled dreams of workers. George Milton is an itinerant laborer with big dreams. He takes care of a mentally disabled man named Lennie Small. Lennie's name is ironic because he is a huge man who unintentionally harms living things because he can't control his own strength.<br /><br />George and Lennie stick together and have just fled from a work site where Lennie horrifed a woman and was accused of rape. He was innocent of the crime, but he put quite a scare into her. George is annoyed and overwhelmed with the responsibility of keeping Lennie out of trouble while pursuing the American dream of carving out a place of his own. He motivates Lennie by telling him of a plan to own a ranch and to allow Lennie to take care of some rabbits.<br /><br />The men came to work on a ranch. They meet some friendly people, but the boss has a son named Curley who is the ornery antagonist of the story. He has a coquettish wife who causes trouble by flirting with the hands and arousing the jealousy of her husband.<br /><br />Steinbeck masterfully uses foreshadowing in the story. He shows how Candy reluctantly allows his old dog to be killed. He also shows how Lennie kills a mouse and a puppy. It is clear that Lennie is destined to have trouble because of his inability to control his tremendous physical strength.<br /><br />Hopes run high as Candy and Crooks want in on the plan to run their own ranch. The dreams are shattered when Curley's wife can't stay away from the barn. She invites trouble by asking Lennie to stroke her soft hair. Lennie panics and strangles her. George knows that Lennie's fate has been sealed. He can see no future for Lennie. He mercifully shoots Lennie to put him out of his misery.<br /><br />This story is symbolic of the chimera of the American dream. Many laborers thought they could rise to the top of society. Instead, race, crippling injuries, prostitution, gambling, and a variety of other setbacks stymie the attempts to get ahead. In Steinbeck's world, a working man can't get a break.<br /><br />This is a good book with an interesting plot. It has a social message and is a critique of the troubles and overwhelming obstacles that face the working man. The only criticism I have is that the plot is a bit far-fetched. It is hard to imagine a scenario of a huge man-child like Lennie causing so much havoc. It is a good book, but it pales some in comparison with the masterpiece \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"tempts to get ahead.

B003SI6C4O|5.0|I would definitely watch this again. It had an unexpected ending. Very suspenseful, entertaining, and kept you on the edge of your seat.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Zip lines are great....enemies chase you and obstacles are fun to navigate.  Red, Blue and Yellow coins add a level of challenge too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I don't think such a classical story would need any review, but since I like it so much I will put a 5.
1780222874|4.0|Firstable, although this book is #3 in The cemetery of forgotten books series, you don't need to have read the previous two in order to read this one.<br /><br />Ruiz Zafon has written each book (The shadow of the wind, The angel's game and now The prisoner of heaven) to stand individually. Of course, all three of them use the same characters (Daniel, Fermin, etc.) and at some point they cross path, but each book can be read individually.<br /><br />In The prisoner of heaven, eloquent Fermin receives the visit of a dark friend from the past. His appearance plunges Fermin and his friend Daniel into a dangerous adventure that started twenty years ago with a man in a prison who the inmates called \\"the prisoner of heaven.\\" Why is he in jail and why Mauricio Valls, the director of the jail hates him so much? That and how Fermin comes into the story is narrated in a novel full of intrigue and suspense.<br /><br />The book is set in Barcelona, during Spain's Civil War (1938-1939); a period where you were incarcerated for just having the wrong thoughts about Franco, the dictator. This political turmoil reminded me of The feast of the goat by Mario Vargas Llosa.<br /><br />I was totally immerse in the story and was very disappointed to see that Valls didn't pay for his crimes! Of course, this is all for another book, not less.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most (as with the previous books) was Fermin's dialogue. Alas! The man has a way with words that just made me read his lines twice and laugh out loud!<br /><br />For those of us who had read Ruiz Zafon's two previous books, The prisoner of heaven holds a nice surprise. But don't worry, you'll be equally surprised by just reading this one too :-)
B0049MJEHA|5.0|this dvd contains the look to take that reunion.<br />you get to see them recording progress and the process of them getting back together.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Just when you have recoiled in horror at the brutality then a peaceful sweetness emerges that comforts you and renews your faith.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I found after reading the book and also reading Michael Oher's &#34;I Beat the Odds&#34; that I saw many &#34;short cuts&#34; and the use of  &#34;literary freedom&#34; that dimmed my acceptance of the movie, but liked the movie in spite of them.
B001PLOK4U|5.0|Seen twice a few years ago. . . I am reminded of this film as I see it listed on my &#34;Review Your Purchases&#34; page on Amazon so,  being unprepared to review it at this time, I'll just say for now that I loved it, that I enjoyed Denzel's performance (as always) and that it's an intelligent film with a well-treated sensitive but inspiring theme(s).  Historical and informative too.
0679805273|5.0|I love Dr, Seuss and my students do as well.  Bought this book to complete my set of Dr, Seuss books and glad I did.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This, for me, was the least favorite of the trilogy.  The narrative and story became too predictable and/ or uninteresting to remain invested in finishing.
034580404X|5.0|I am not much of a reader but read the first book in 2 days and the second in 3.  I couldn't put them down!
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson wrote his heart out in this book! He did a wonderful job outlining and detailing ALL important event throughout Job's life, both good and bad. He gave very honest facts and didn't shade the truth in places you would expect many writers to do so when writing a bio. From the very second I opened the book, I literally couldn't put in down until I finished, and Im not anywhere close to the reader I used to be!<br /><br />truly wonderful book!
0060820985|5.0|excellent on time description quality ALL WERE EXCELLENT ,ON TIME , EARLIER THEN I EXPECTED, CLEAN SEALED EVERYTING WAS CORRECT
B00B2QA646|2.0|I found this movie to be beautiful, lush sets, amazing colors and clothing, but I was really confused about what was going on.  I agree with the other reviews that talk about how the look and feel distract from the story.  I really wanted to like this movie and I kept waiting for it to all come together.  I fell asleep the first time I watched and then the second time.  This was a 48-hour rental and I finally just gave up without finishing.  I give this movie 2 stars for the sets and costumes.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|excellent on time description quality ALL WERE EXCELLENT ,ON TIME , EARLIER THEN I EXPECTED, CLEAN SEALED EVERYTING WAS CORRECT
B003JBHQP4|5.0|I bought this Memory Card Reader to use it with my Canon 7D because my laptop doesn't come with a CompactFlash (CF) memory card reader built in. I take a lot of photos when I travel so I will have to empty out the CF memory cards often. Since I have multiple CF cards, I figure using a memory card reader is probably easier for me than hooking the camera up directly to the laptop. Less messing around with the camera that is actually more expensive than my laptop.<br /><br />The size of this card reader is nice for one that accepts all of the memory card standards out there. It's very light weight. I haven't measured exactly how fast the card reader's transfer speed is but for me it's fast enough for the job.<br /><br />The cable that came with it is short but that isn't an issue for me since it's just a card reader and it'll be staying close to the laptop anyways.<br /><br />Otherwise, the card reader is perfect for me and the price is really competitive. I got this in early January of 2013 and have used it 3 times so far. Reliability is good so far but I'll update this comment if anything else happen.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best Bond Movie in years! Let's hope that the next one and the ones after that are mae with the same kind of love as this one was.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Was a great book it totally deserves 5stars<br />What a great book I am very happy I read it because it was a book great book to read and it was totally worthy of my time it was awesome it definitely described like I was there ,it's a must read for all ages .
B0084BMUFA|5.0|There is not much to say about this that has not been said before but its a perfect Christmas read.  Excellent story of redemption.  Perfect for a cold December night.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's the best kindle game I've played and I'm a big tablet gamer  I handwritten temple run 2 but I've played it on my bros kindle it awesome I hope their is going to be a temple run three (click  the helpful button if you agree
B003F1WM2K|1.0|Shameless name dropping, oh so precious, extensive and often obscure musical and literary references that would be extremely pretentious even for a holder of a Masters in fine arts - hardly believable from an relatively uneducated 19 year old hippy - this book left me feeling conned.  I couldn't even stomach finishing it.  And I almost always finish books.  I am stunned at all the buzz about it.  Sycophants is all I can conclude. Ugh.
0756688701|5.0|My 9 year old is a reluctant reader so I got this book for him since he is really in to the Disney Pixar Car movies right now. He LOVES this book. He has read all the descriptions of the cars front to back. I just love that he is reading. It came with a Lightening McQueen car which we didn't notice in the description when ordering so that was a nice surprise. Very Happy with our Purchase.
B003B02O7I|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while.  I was hooked after reading the first page.  The book has a little of everything:  mystery, adventure, romance, and good vs evil.  I've been a Grisham fan for years and this may be the best.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Hopkins at his best. Hard to believe this screen Hitchcock and Hannibal Lechter are played by the same guy. Baby boomers who grew up on Hitch will love this film.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Work unbelievably well on several laptop computers mostly with Windows 7 32and 64 bit.  All operating systems I did go to the web site and download the updated drivers instead of using the CD that came with the product.  Overall this unit picked up at least 4 satellites while I was inside almost immediately upon activating the GPS unit.  I did try this with my tablet with android 4.x ice cream i think and it unfortunately didn't  work because that is where I really wanted it to work.  I find out that external GPS on tablets 99% will not work so I will use it on an older laptop for my RV travels.  I used it with MS streets and trips 2010 and 2013 and worked great.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|I like alien invasion movies. I also like military movies. Sometimes I love them when they're together...but at that point, I'm expecting a large amount of suspension of disbelief, not 'hey, we're marines! And OH! We're fighting aliens!' In this movie, that's exactly what they tried to do, and for me at least, it fell short because of that. I could have done without the aliens while the audience followed the marines on the battlefield--honestly, the story would have done fine without aliens at all, and I would have liked it better. And when it came to aliens...there just wasn't enough of them for me to really feel like they were a threat. Just a target, better equipped, sure, but I just couldn't get into the 'alien invasion' part of the movie. Between that, and the two or three 'false endings' before they got to the real one, it felt dragged out. By the end of it, I had lost focus and was pretty much hanging on so that I'd at least know how it all ended. I felt shell shocked, and not in a good way. They either needed a better balance between war story and sci-fi, or they needed to pick one. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like it, but even on a long boring day with nothing better to do, if I have a choice of re-watching it on cable or turning the TV off...the TV goes off.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|One word sums up this film.  Incredible!  By now, you know the story of Rodriguez.  A very touching and uplifting story.  Hollywood couldn't make up this script.  What about the film itself?  Fans owe a lot to Swedish filmmaker, Malik Bandjelloul, who so brilliantly presented this story and re-introduced the world to Sixto Rodriguez.  It's not your typical documentary.  It's very worthy of its Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature.  I wanted to see the film before the Academy Awards.  Now I can say it would be great if this film won the Oscar.  It's that good.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is by far in my opinion the quintessence of eastcoast mafioso rap (besides Only Built For Cuban Linx of corce) nas proves in this album that he is versatile making both radio freindly songs and hardcore crimedrama type street anthems. At the time when  this album dropped  people hated on this gem because they we're expecting an illmatic 2. Its about time that this album gets the recognition it deserves I would advice any 90s hip hop head to get this classics it speaks volumes and is just and good if not better then its predecessor (illmatic)
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Bleh! This movie was terrible...First, it destroyed my opinion on Teddy Rupskin. Second, I am going to assume that Mark Wahlberg was forced to take this movie because I want to continue to have respect for him as an actor (on the other hand, this is a step up for Mara S. from that 70's show). Third, it was pretty bad...actually, very bad. I am saddened MW--step your game back up or go back to being half naked in action movies. That is all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds offers a wide variety of birds who do different things when placed in the slingshot. I love to get three stars on each level and do not want to move on until that is accomplished. Some sections seem as though they will never all be hit...but eventually I usually manage...even surprise myself!! Even my husband enjoys playing when he can find me not playing!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app. Since the kindle fire doesn't have a youtube app this  takes the place. And you can download videos. Love this app 50 stars in my opinion
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Was a very good movie as most of Denzel Washington's movies are.Will enjoy watching this one again and again. Priced right also.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as awesome as Gone Girl, but good in its own twisted, dark way. Another good twist of an ending. Looking forward to her next book!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The George RR Martin &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34; novels have gone straight downhill with the last two novels, &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; and &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34;. The first 3 books in the series are outstanding, but the previously mentioned 2 books are EXTREMELY slow. Those books should have been aggressively edited...they are long and for the most part very dull. I'm not sure I'm even going to buy the next in the series, if it ever comes out.
0767840135|2.0|i dont know what they did to the dvd because the VHS tape (which i no longer have right now) sounds normal. the dvd on the other hand sounds slower, and low pitched. so i don't know exactly what happened in the converting room to making this a dvd but someone messed up. i am not pleased with my purchase, this sounds nothing like the VHS or the soundtrack. it should not be this low or this slow.......
B008CYDDWI|4.0|The &#34;classic&#34; 1985 film based on the Lovecraft story &#34;Herbert West: Reanimator&#34;. Jeffrey Coombs stars as Herbert West in this tongue in cheek horror film. Dark humor throughout, this film is very fun and never takes itself too seriously. If you enjoy over the top horror with a little comedic value I recommend this film.
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey gives a great performance in this movie. I highly recommend watching it.<br />I have nothing more to add, so enjoy!
B001NXDIMK|5.0|For those who follow Damages, it was a good buy. Watched the first series on Netflix but had reception issues.<br />Enjoyed the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always love Nicholas Sparks book and this was no Exception.<br /><br />Thought it was a Great storey and great book
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's ok a bit like temple run and angry gran but it is quite hard to unlock other people but there is a daily challenge so that's ok
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Ending was totally unexpected but left me with the possibility if only... I would recommend to others.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds!  It is a challenge as well as addictive!  I've had it and my kindle since Christmas and it has given me hundreds of hours of pleasure!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So addicting-cant stop watching it! Best show on tv right now :)<br />I'm wondering where this season will end-who's going to die next & how will the next season be?
